{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Business Insider Edition  Americans aren't thrilled about the economy.          Business Insider has heard from retirees watching their investments fluctuate in the stock market, parents struggling with the high cost of groceries and childcare, and business leaders bracing for a downturn. This comes alongside the Trump administration's roller-coaster tariff announcementsand sweeping cuts to the federal workforce. The US may not be in a recession yet \u2014 but we are in a vibecession.               This growing distrust could have serious consequences, as a fear-driven pullback in spending is one step toward an actual downturn. Cynical shoppers may avoid nonessential purchases, businesses could pause hiring, and investors might step back from the market. And the slower the economy, the weaker it becomes.               \"There's a massive amount of uncertainty that's really weighing on people,\" said Joanne Hsu, who oversees the closely watched University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment, which in March dropped to its lowest point in three years. \"People are really worried that these policies are going to lead to a resurgence in inflation. We're seeing a deterioration in views related to the overall economy, which is related to personal finances, inflation, and most critically, labor markets.\"       The vibecession rears its head whenever Americans are feeling particularly uncertain about the economy. Even if the major economic indicators aren't alarming on paper, rapid changes on Wall Street and in the White House historically make consumers and businesses nervous.               Many consumers are worried about how federal policy will shape the cost of essentials such as groceries and housing. The Consumer Sentiment Index \u2014 which is based on surveys and interviews with hundreds of US adults by researchers at the University of Michigan \u2014 decreased by 16.1 points between December and March.That's the sharpest three-month drop since the pandemic began in 2020.               The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index has climbed over 60 points since December, a much higher-than-typical jump. The measure is based on how often major media outlets are reporting on economic uncertainty, the frequency of disagreement among economic forecasters, and other factors.               The research firm Civiqs also found that over a quarter of Americans believe the economy is doing \"very bad right now. Google searches for recession have spiked in the past 30 days.               Among consumers, Trump is losing ground on what has historically been his \u2014 and the GOP's \u2014 strongest issue. The majority of Americans disapprove of Trump's second-term job performance on the economy (54% disapprove) and how he's handling inflation and cost of living (55% disapprove), per an NBC News poll published March 16.               \"If people both think the economy is deteriorating and they expect their own incomes to weaken as well, it's hard to imagine how robust consumer spending can really be under those circumstances,\" Hsu said.       Businesses aren't escaping the vibescession either. Many CEOs and executives are worried that the economic uncertainty will put a damper on profits, hiring, and growth.               The Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that general business conditions, new orders and shipments, employment levels, and financial optimism have all declined among businesses across the state in 2025.               \"Small businesses have particularly few options and little wiggle room to deal with the sheer size of the tariffs in the pipeline,\" Diane Swonk, the chief economist at KPMG, told BI in an email. \"They both squeeze profits margins and prompt cuts to staff, while boosting prices.\"       At the C-Suite level, some companies' plans for hiring and capital investment, as well as sales projections, have decreased since Trump's inauguration, a survey of 150 CEOs by Business Roundtable found. Business Roundtable CEO Joshua Bolten wrote in the March survey report that the downward trends are based on \"several factors, including signs of economic headwinds and an atmosphere of uncertainty in Washington.\"               Vibecessions aren't new. Consumer sentiment also dipped during and shortly after the pandemic and again ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Instability in the stock market, high inflation, and job losses often lead to widespread financial anxiety. Still, Americans' current pessimism about the economy is notable.               The present vibecession comes in the context of declines in the S&P 500, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq in recent weeks. While the markets have shown some signs of recovery, they remain well below their February highs. Trump's steep \u2014 and quickly shifting \u2014 tariff policies have also left US businesses and consumers expecting a significant jump in prices for things like food, construction materials, electronics, and alcohol.               Inflation has eased from its post-pandemic highs, but many shoppers feel like their budgets are stretched thin. The\u00a0chaos around the availability and cost of eggs, for example, has become a symbol of overall inflation fears.               The Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency have added to that uncertainty by firing thousands of federal workers and slashing the budgets of several government programs. Layoffs also hit major companies like Meta, Amazon, Southwest, and others in rapid succession, further fueling the public's perception of economic turmoil. This comes as the white-collar job market has been increasingly difficult to break into, despite overall unemployment rates holding steady.               Hsu told BI that consumer sentiment patterns typically fall along party lines \u2014 Democrats feel more economically confident when the president is a Democrat, and Republicans more confident under Republican administrations. But in the past few months, consumer sentiment has significantly declined among Democrats, Republicans, and Independents.               The US isn't in a true recession. Economists and financial analysts told BI that economic downturns are measured on several factors, including long-term labor market and consumer spending data. A few weeks of stock market and policy instability aren't enough to call a recession.               Still, even if the US economy isn't doing as badly as Americans imagine, a vibecession changes consumer behavior. People are likely to tighten their spending on nonessentials and delay major purchases, which could disrupt the travel industry and the housing market. Some small businesses and major corporations have also signaled that they plan to pass the price of Trump's tariffs onto consumers, which could contribute to shoppers buying less.       \"Moral of the story is that when uncertainty spikes, we tend to err on the side of caution and delay big spending decisions,\" Swonk said. \"We are seeing that base emotion play out in real time in the overall economy.\"               Retirees\u00a0and hopeful retirees told BI that they are adjusting their\u00a0stock market\u00a0and 401(k) investments to be more conservative. Hsu said job seekers may also become less likely to leave their current jobs or seek outside promotions, affecting\u00a0labor market\u00a0churn.               The stock market has shown signs of recovery in the past few days, but America's latest vibecession isn't over \u2014 and the future is hard to predict.               \"We're in a really unprecedented policy environment,\" Hsu said. \"With policy changing every day, and every hour in some situations, it's really hard for consumers to plan in a meaningful way.\"       Do you have a story to share about your finances?

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Business Insider Edition  The value gap between Elon Musk's stakes in Tesla and SpaceX has widened to $43 billion following the slide in the EV maker's stock.          Musk has a stake of about 42% in SpaceX, according to Bloomberg. The rocket and satellite company was most recently valued at $350 billion, with his stake worth $136 billion taking into account a 5% private company discount.               Musk's 13% stake in Tesla is worth $92.6 billion per Bloomberg's calculations \u2014\u00a0a difference of $43.4 billion.               His holding in xAI is third, at $22.6 billion, with stakes in X Corp, The Boring Company and Neuralink also contributing to his wealth.               Musk is still firmly atop the Bloomberg Billionaires Index at $303 billion as of Tuesday's close. His net worth has cratered by $130 billion, or 30%, this year largely due to the fall in Tesla stock.               It's down more than 50% from mid-December, wiping some $800 billion from its market cap to just above $700 billion at Tuesday's close. Tesla closed 5% lower on Tuesday.               Musk became the first person to be worth more than $400 billion in December.               Tesla stock surged after Donald Trump won the presidential election in November. Musk had aggressively campaigned for Trump, spending more than $200 million.               However, sliding Tesla sales have unnerved investors, along with criticism of Musk's political interventions with DOGE.               The average price of a used Tesla is now $10,000 less than that of a non-Tesla electric vehicle, Business Insider previously reported based on data from the dealership website CarGurus.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Business Insider Edition  It's time to think differently\u00a0about Apple.          The company is becoming a utility, which is hard for\u00a0fanboys\u00a0to accept, though it's not all bad.               The iPhone has become the standard tool for accessing online data and running our lives. Most owners don't care about cutting-edge AI\u00a0or the latest speedy chip. They just need the device to keep working.       Apple fans have been aflutter lately over the company's decision to postpone new AI features, with some analysts predicting lower iPhone sales as a result.               That may be important for a tiny fraction of customers, such as Apple bloggers and the odd person who absolutely needs the latest and greatest iPhone. For everyone else, we don't care. We mostly want the battery to last all day, our apps to run, our texts to go through, and a camera to just work. This can be done with any iPhone, and it doesn't need AI.               Similar to an electric utility, we rely on the iPhone a lot. Most of us don't think about it passionately until something goes wrong. That's usually the battery degrading. Or when Apple updates the operating system, and a few older iPhones no longer work. Or you damage it beyond repair, or it gets stolen.               This drives an iPhone upgrade cycle that has become incredibly powerful and has little to do with fancy new AI features. Eventually, every one of the roughly 1.5 billion iPhones out there will have to be replaced.               \"300 million iPhones have not upgraded in over four years,\" Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote recently in an email to Business Insider. \"That's a lot of pent-up demand.\"               This is the main driver of iPhone sales now. It's not that sexy, and it's not high growth. Instead, it's big and steady, like a utility.               The chart above, based on data compiled by Dan Morgan, a portfolio manager at Synovus, indicates that iPhone sales have flatlined for a decade.               That might seem bad. But Apple shares have soared sevenfold in the past decade, massively outperforming the broader stock market. It's the most valuable public company in the world. By a lot.               During that same time, Siri \u2014 Apple's main AI offering \u2014 has sucked pretty hard. How much did that derail the iPhone upgrade train? Not much, judging by the data above.               Apple did not respond to a request for comment from BI.       Warren Buffett, a massive utility investor, remains one of Apple's largest shareholders. In his latest letter to\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, he listed Apple alongside other unsexy, non-AI companies, such as American Express, Coca-Cola, and Moody's.               He seems blissfully uninterested in the latest whizz-bang Apple technology and how that might help sell more iPhones in a given quarter.               \"The idea that spending loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X or whatever are going to be sold in a given three-month period, to me, it totally misses the point,\" Buffett said in 2018.       Buffett likes Apple for similar reasons he loves utilities and other vaguely boring, profitable companies. Many people need what these companies sell, which helps them generate large, reliable returns \u2014 including juicy dividends.               Electricity. Water. An iPhone. These are essential ingredients for modern life. Without them, things can get difficult quickly. Take my family's experience as an example.               My wife's iPhone was stolen last year. She waited only a few hours before driving to the nearest Apple store to hand over almost $1,000 for a replacement. She described the thought of existing without an iPhone as \"panic.\"               First up: She used two-factor authentication via her iPhone to access sensitive work documents. She couldn't work without a new Apple device. (She's added a backup now. Guess what it is? An iPad!)               Then, a long list of other practical tasks revealed themselves to be difficult without an iPhone: booking an exercise class, texting a group of friends, keeping streaks going on mobile games, and accessing the iPhone's digital wallet for tickets she needed soon.               My daughter broke her iPhone beyond repair last year. She experienced similar panic and bought a replacement from Apple within 24 hours.               She uses a mobile app on her iPhone to authenticate and access her college accounts for submitting homework and doing other study-related stuff. She also had a plane to catch and was worried about not having the digital ticket.               Both my wife and my daughter worried about the data on their iPhones and thought it would be safer and easier to get a new iPhone to reclaim this digital information.               This year, my iPhone SE's battery started running low, and I struggled to hear people well on phone calls. These problems were fixable and probably related to user error. I could have gotten a new battery from Apple, for instance, yet I just could not be bothered. So I bought a new iPhone 16e. It was so easy, and my life was uninterrupted. I did not think about AI once during this process.               My wife, my daughter, and I did not ever once consider getting an Android phone instead. For many nontechnical consumers, switching is too complex.               My wife knew her stolen iPhone was backed up in Apple's iCloud, so getting the same device again made the replacement process much quicker and smoother.               \"I knew that if I bought another one, it would be as painless as possible to access my photos, wallet, apps, contacts, etc.,\" she told me. \"I was already pained by the stolen iPhone. Switching to Android at that moment made no sense. I'd have been breaking myself into jail.\"               A 2023\u00a0study by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimated that only about 4% of Android phone buyers switched from an iPhone. The authors wrote that a big reason was \"fear of the complexity of switching.\"               \"There's not a lot of iOS-to-Android switching,\" said Josh Lowitz, a partner at CIRP. \"Switching between platforms is not that difficult, but the habits and iOS-specific apps and connections are hard to leave.\"               This is why a year or so of delay in AI features won't matter much. When an iPhone stops working, its owner will almost certainly buy another, with or without AI.               So we should watch: How many old iPhones will Apple stop supporting? The company does an amazing job keeping these devices running for years. But after a certain point, the hardware just can't keep up.               That's when some handsets are\u00a0dropped from iOS. Later this year, probably in September, Apple will do this again, and millions of people will have to pay to upgrade \u2014 just as I have to keep paying PG&E to pump electricity and natural gas into my house.\u00a0               This is a long way from the cutting-edge technology that Apple fanboys love to nerd out about. There hasn't been much to get excited about lately on that front.\u00a0Apple scrapped\u00a0its car project. The\u00a0Vision Pro\u00a0mixed-reality goggles have flopped so far. And now, these AI delays show how far Apple lags behind Google, Meta, and OpenAI.               All is not lost, though. If Apple were a true utility, regulators would cap what it charges customers, which would probably crush the stock.               Instead, Apple can charge what it wants for iPhones. Take the latest example. The cheapest version of the new iPhone 16e costs $170 more than the last entry-level iPhone, the SE. That's 40% inflation in the base cost to access your digital life.               \"Without a new iPhone SE, current iPhone SE owners will likely hold on to their phones a little longer,\" said CIRP's Lowitz. \"When they need to get a new phone, they will likely buy the most affordable new iPhone.\"               What an incredible business. No wonder Apple has become the world's most valuable company \u2014 with or without AI.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"VR headsets are out, and AR glasses are in. Research from analysis firm Counterpoint shows that the global VR shipments trended down through 2024 despite proliferation cheap headsets like the Meta Quest 3s. Worse, VR sales numbers may not improve any time soon. The next step for these companies are glasses\u00e2\u0080\u0094with or without augmented reality capabilities. Big tech now needs to convince consumers thin glasses filled to the brim with AI are better than shoving a heavy piece of plastic on their noggins. The number of VR headsets shipped globally fell by 12% year-over-year. Headset shipments fell a whole 5% in the last quarter of 2024. That was despite the grandaddy of the virtual reality hype bubble, Meta, promoting the $300 Meta Quest 3s. That cheap but capable headset gave the Mark Zuckerberg-led company an even greater VR market share than in previous quarters, consuming more slices of a dwindling pie. Sony managed to hold on to its bare 9% market share, likely because of its PlayStation VR2, which got a boost from its integration with PCVR late last year, plus the usual holiday discounts. The luster is coming off the VR headset, and not just the really affordable ones. The Apple Vision Pro was similarly in decline in the last few months of 2024. Counterpoint said shipments of Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first \u00e2\u0080\u009cspatial computer\u00e2\u0080\u009d fell by 43% in the quarter of 2024. The company had a small boost in sales when it took its headset to a few select global markets in the middle of last year, but it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t help its market share when it ended the year at just 2%. The analysis firm contended that the VR market won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t gain much ground in the next two years. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly due to a lack of content and the common complaint about discomfort from shoving a screen in front of your eyes for hours on end. These complaints aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t new. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been present for years, even more so back when Meta was all in on promoting the shared VR world called \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe metaverse.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Now that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re several years past the hype cycle, Meta and Zuckerberg have glasses on the mind. The unexpected success of the Meta Ray-Ban has the company raring to go on more wearable products. The company also sees these glasses as a vehicle for getting you used to its cloud-based AI models meant to offer you a personal assistant straight from your face. Counterpoint claimed the AR glasses market will grow 30% through 2026. The Ray-Ban Meta glasses proved such a big hit that Meta now hopes to release \u00e2\u0080\u009chalf a dozen\u00e2\u0080\u009d new AR glasses models in 2025. Zuckerberg told investors earlier this year he thinks the company could sell \u00e2\u0080\u009cbillions\u00e2\u0080\u009d of AI-enabled AR glasses to completely corner the market like it did with VR. Apple is further behind on its long-rumored smart spectacles project, though it may have something to show in the next few years, according to the latest rumors. And still, more big tech players are getting into the VR\/AR headset game. Samsung and Google are developing Project Moohan, an AR headset that seems close in capabilities and\u00e2\u0080\u0094if you look at its rumored specs\u00e2\u0080\u0094the high price to the $3,500 Vision Pro. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve used the Ray-Ban Meta, and I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as impressed as others. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fine for shooting hands-free photos and video (though without control for focus or zoom makes them less than ideal). As for the much-touted AI connectivity, I have yet to find a use for a chatbot that routinely fails to identify objects around it correctly. Beyond smart sunglasses, the next step for lighter, feature packed wearable devices is augmented reality visuals like a heads-up display scrolling in front of your eyes. CES 2025 was flooded with these kinds of devices, some of which with integrated AI chatbots and screens with blazing green text. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve put on plenty, and all of them still don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like usable products. They lack a solid use case without capabilities that go beyond a typical smartphone. Perhaps Google, Meta, Apple, or any number of smaller companies may show up in 2025 with something that is both light and powerful. The closest we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen to that promise so far is Meta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Orion, a pair of true AR glasses. And still, the issue with AR-capable wearables is that you need to stick a powerful computer in an incredibly small package. Meta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pet AR spectacles project requires an additional data puck to function. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an issue that reportedly killed Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans for tethered AR glasses. We may be able to avoid the discomfort of headsets in 2025, but we may instead be tangled in a mess of wires running from our faces to our pockets or have AI chatbots talking to us through our glasses.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"     Concerns over Trump's economic policies are clouding the rate outlook ahead of the spring homebuying season.    Today, the Federal Reserve voted to extend a pause on rate cuts for a second consecutive time this year.\u00a0 The bottom line is there's a lot of uncertainty in today's economy. Holding rates steady gives the central bank time to assess the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, immigration policies and federal layoffs, as the markets face lingering inflation and heightened recession risks.\u00a0 The Fed's pause could keep mortgage interest rates \u2014 which are sensitive to fiscal policy and economic growth \u2014 higher for longer.\u00a0 If you're in the market for a new home, average mortgage rates are projected to stay above 6% for a while.\u00a0 For better or worse, the Fed's relationship to home loan rates isn't direct or immediate. \"While the Fed certainly can influence mortgage rates, investors are the true movers,\" said\u00a0Ali Wolf, chief economist at Zonda and New Home Source. In the mortgage market, what the central bank says matters more than what it does. On Wednesday, investors and bond market traders eyed the Fed's updated Summary of Economic Projections, which outlines officials' expectations for interest rates and the broader economy. While the Fed still expects to make two 0.25% cuts in 2025 (the same forecast as December's), it also signaled concerns about the potentially adverse impacts of tariffs and weakening economic conditions.\u00a0 \"Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased,\" Fed chairman Jerome Powell said in a\u00a0statement, noting the need to wait for more clarity before adjusting interest rates.\u00a0 Still, policymakers' \"wait and see\" approach isn't entirely to blame for an unaffordable housing market that remains plagued by\u00a0limited inventory\u00a0and steep\u00a0home prices.\u00a0 The Fed sets and oversees US monetary policy under a dual mandate to maintain price stability and maximum employment. It does this largely by adjusting the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow and lend their money.\u00a0 When the economy is in a slump or downturn, the Fed reduces interest rates to stimulate consumer spending and propel growth, as it did during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 In an inflationary environment, the Fed raises interest rates to slow economic growth. For example, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by more than five percentage points between early 2022 and mid-2023 to combat inflation by curbing consumer borrowing and spending. Though the Fed doesn't set mortgage rates, altering the price of credit causes a slow domino effect on mortgage rates and the broader housing market. Banks typically pass along the Fed's rate hikes or cuts to consumers through longer-term loans, including home loans.\u00a0 \"Borrowing costs are important to prospective homebuyers,\" said Wolf. Cheaper interest rates make financing a home more appealing, opening up the market to first-time buyers as well as existing homeowners seeking to move.\u00a0 Because mortgage rates respond to several economic factors (see below), it's not uncommon for the federal funds rate and mortgage rates to move in different directions for some time.\u00a0 Read more: Why Labor Data Matters for Mortgage Rates and the Fed In 2024, the Fed slashed interest rates three times for a total of one percentage point. At the start of 2025, it held them steady to \"carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks.\" The Trump administration's economic agenda and trade wars, expected to fuel price growth at a time when inflation remains sticky, continue to cloud the outlook for rate reductions.\u00a0 Though the Fed is projecting two cuts in 2025, that could still change with the next economic projections released in June.\u00a0 \"If the Fed communicates any kind of shift in their economic projections or the future path of short-term rates, mortgage rates can fluctuate,\" said Wolf. According to the\u00a0CME FedWatch Tool, investors are betting on the next rate cut in June or July. For the Fed to resume lowering interest rates, however, policymakers would need to see an ongoing decline in inflation or a rapid deterioration of the labor market. Today's turbulent political and economic environment is already sparking concerns among investors that the US may be headed toward a recession. Over the last month, the stock market has plunged, mass layoffs have hit public and private sectors, households have cut spending and consumer confidence has slumped.\u00a0 Wolf said a dramatically cooling economy or a further souring of consumer, business, and investor sentiment could push mortgage rates lower. However, mortgage rate movement is always volatile, and the dips won't be drastic. Most housing market experts see average 30-year fixed rates staying between 6% and 7% throughout most of 2025. Though mortgage rates typically fall during tough economic times, a recession won't lead to a more affordable or accessible housing market. If US families are struggling with the impact of higher prices and decreased purchasing power, not to mention a lack of stable employment, they'll be less likely to buy homes.\u00a0 \"Consumers need to feel comfortable in their financial well-being to make the largest purchase of their lives,\" said Wolf.\u00a0 Mortgage rates\u00a0move around for many of the same reasons home prices do: supply, demand, inflation and even the employment rate.\u00a0 Personal factors, such as a homebuyer's credit score, down payment and home loan amount, also determine one's individual mortgage rate. Different loan types and terms also have varying interest rates.\u00a0 Policy changes: When the Fed adjusts the federal funds rate, it affects many aspects of the economy, including mortgage rates. The federal funds rate affects how much it costs banks to borrow money, which in turn affects what banks charge consumers to make a profit. Inflation: Generally, when inflation is high, mortgage rates tend to be high. Because inflation chips away at purchasing power, lenders set higher interest rates on loans to make up for that loss and ensure a profit. Supply and demand: When demand for mortgages is high, lenders tend to raise interest rates. This is because they have only so much capital to lend out in the form of home loans. Conversely, when demand for mortgages is low, lenders tend to slash interest rates to attract borrowers. Bond market activity: Mortgage lenders peg fixed interest rates, like fixed-rate mortgages, to bond rates. Mortgage bonds, also called mortgage-backed securities, are bundles of mortgages sold to investors and are closely tied to the 10-year Treasury. When bond interest rates are high, the bond has less value on the market where investors buy and sell securities, causing mortgage interest rates to go up. Other key indicators:\u00a0Employment patterns and other aspects of the economy that affect investor confidence and consumer spending and borrowing also influence mortgage rates. For instance, a strong jobs report and a robust economy could indicate greater demand for housing, which can put upward pressure on mortgage rates. When the economy slows and unemployment is high, mortgage rates tend to be lower. Read more:\u00a0Fact Check: Trump Doesn't Have the Power to Force Lower Interest Rates Even though timing is everything in the mortgage market, you can't control what the Fed does. \"Forecasting interest rates is nearly impossible in today's market,\" said Wolf.\u00a0 Regardless of the economy, the most important thing when shopping for a mortgage is to make sure you can comfortably afford your monthly payments.\u00a0","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Business Insider Edition  Good morning. New documents filed by the Justice Department shed light on how far the White House has gone in trying to cut probationary staff from the federal government. It's the largest insight yet into the mass firings.          Oh, and if you're missing your usual anchor Dan DeFrancesco, he's got a funny story for you from parental leave.               In today's big story, tech companies are sending a message to employees: The days of perks and pampering are over.   What's on deck           First, the tables have turned.       Do more with less. That's the new mantra in Silicon Valley. Gone are the days of the in-office massage, the free laundry services, and the fancy food.       Layoffs and budget cuts have become pervasive in response to a trifecta of issues: economics, post-pandemic realities, and political pressure.               But CEOs aren't just ending the office pampering \u2014 they want everyone to know it.               Between performance-based cuts, return-to-office mandates, and the stripping of workplace perks, the message is clear: Tech is going hardcore.               Here are just several examples of how tech companies have changed their tune:       Big Tech leaders haven't been shy about adopting hard-driving strategies. But what do their employees think?           BI reporters interviewed staff at tech giants including Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta \u2014 as well as various startups \u2014 about the changes.               \"There is more pressure for individuals to be better in their roles, and there is much more aggressive performance management happening these days,\" a current Google manager told BI.               A recruiting firm cofounder said he's heard multiple leaders tell their employees the same thing: \"If you're not all in, no hard feelings, we can give severance, but we can't slow down.\"               Tech employees had it sweet. Now, they have to sweat.       1. Tesla's stock slide just sped up. Shares are on pace to fall for a 9th straight week, and the slide accelerated on Tuesday thanks to a hailstorm of issues involving its CEO, competition, and expectations on Wall Street. However, Tesla's employees \u2014 many of whom receive large stock grants as part of their compensation packages \u2014 aren't worried.       2. Stagflation is the market's big bogeyman. Investors dumped a record amount of US stock last week. Growing stagflation fears were key, a Bank of America survey found, with 71% of fund managers saying they expected it to hit the global economy in the next 12 months.       3. Predicting where stocks could go next. It's a bad idea to use news headlines when trying to guess where the markets will go. Technical analyst Helene Meisler told BI the five charts she's using instead to gauge market sentiment, and what she sees in its future.       1. A big acquisition with bigger implications. Google's parent company Alphabet has acquired the cybersecurity firm Wiz for a whopping $32 billion. The deal rewards early Wiz investors, but other startups could stand to benefit if it catalyzes an M&A cycle. It'll also test the regulatory environment under Trump.       2. Elon Musk has gone MIA as CEO. He's not the only one. Musk's reign at DOGE has Tesla investors wanting their CEO back \u2014 but he's not the first chief executive to go AWOL. Company morale and productivity are paying the price.       3. Everything Jensen Huang revealed at the Nvidia conference. The CEO shared the company's road map for the next few years, including updates on the next generation of chips. He also introduced Blue, a \"Star Wars\"-like robot, to show off a partnership with Google and Disney.       1. One year after the real-estate revolution. A landmark settlement upended traditional industry practice by changing the way real estate agents are paid. Now, some Americans are saving big on homebuying.       2. The vibecession is back. The US isn't in a recession, but Americans feel like they're in one. That's thanks to recent market volatility, Trump's shifting tariff policies, and more. Even if the economy isn't doing as badly as Americans imagine, a vibecession still has serious consequences.       3. Inside JPMorgan's RTO plans for its largest office. Employees at JPMorgan's Polaris campus are heading back to the office next month. The bank is promising amenities like upgraded dining and shuttle services, according to a memo exclusively seen by BI, but not everyone is thrilled.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Business Insider Edition  When my husband and I moved from the Midwestern US to Toronto about 14 years ago, I didn't quite know what to expect.          Although I'd traveled widely elsewhere, I'd only ever been to Canada once for a few days. That said, immigrating to Canada has come with some logistical annoyances and pleasant surprises for us.               Here are a few things I've learned over the years that might help (and even surprise) others considering the move.               Maintaining financial ties to the United States was challenging for us at first.               I needed a US bank account to pay my student loans and deposit checks from my American clients, but we also required a Canadian account for my partner's paycheck.               Asking for suggestions from other American immigrants in Toronto was a huge help since many had gone through similar struggles. We trialed three banks before finding a major Canadian bank that also offered linkable US accounts.                Federal regulations, taxes, and limited options cause domestic Canadian airfares to be quite expensive, so we have not found cheap flights since we moved here.               Once, I tried to get around the high costs by taking a 90-minute bus ride across the Canadian border so I could fly out of an airport in Buffalo, New York. However, this backfired when the driver got lost, and I missed my flight.                Even so, traveling within Canada has been an unexpected joy, especially due to the country's vast natural beauty.               My family's been able to explore Vancouver via ferry and see the rugged beaches of British Columbia's Sunshine Coast. One of our most spectacular memories is still flying over lakes covered with chunks of floating ice in the Northwest Territories while heading toward Yukon in June.               I'm honestly still vexed by the higher prices here for certain consumable items, like dairy products and alcohol.               While living in the United States, I knew that the US government heavily subsidizes agriculture, including the dairy industry. In Canada, the federal government sets milk prices, so a gallon can often cost much more than what we were used to in the US.               These dairy prices also impact other goods, so cheese has now become a bit of a luxury for my family.               We've also found many alcoholic drinks here cost more than they did in the US because of taxes and other government regulations. Some of these prices can feel exorbitant \u2014 so, for us, beer, wine, or liquor are only for fancy occasions.               And now, we understand why many Canadians load up on bottles of booze to bring back home from their visits to the United States.       Canada's real-estate landscape feels like a mess of high prices and limited supply that is tricky to navigate. In many ways, it's not so different from the US.               For example, affordable housing can be difficult to find in Toronto  \u2014 and during our first decade here, the city's average detached house price skyrocketed.               Like many others, we still feel torn about whether it's better to own or rent here.               When we first moved, we frantically desired to buy a place because we felt it'd really help us get a financial foothold in a new country.               However, it took us more than 10 years to save for a down payment, and we're still not sure purchasing our tiny condo was worth it.               It's hard to stomach just how much more our mortgage and condo fees cost compared to what we'd been paying to rent. All that said, I fear our child will never be able to afford to buy a home in Canada.               French is one of Canada's two official languages (alongside English), and it's primarily spoken in Quebec.               Although we aren't based there, I've still found it fairly easy to pick up French phrases and words while living in Canada. I knew virtually no French when I arrived, but started learning words from food labels and household product packages.               After all, the Canadian government requires domestic and foreign prepackaged products sold here to have labels in both French and English.               This has felt like having a mini English-French dictionary all around me, and the repetition of seeing the same words over and over has helped me build up a strong French vocabulary.               Once I gained permanent residency in Canada, I also became eligible for free French classes. I hope to someday have the time to properly learn the language.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"China is frequently a target of criticism over allegations that it does not innovate but instead exfiltrates intellectual property developed abroad and wins by undercutting rivals on price. Now that the country has arguably leapfrogged America in electrical vehicle technology, it is starting to see the value in protecting domestic business in the free market. According to the Financial Times, authorities in China have delayed approval of a new BYD factory in Mexico over concerns that its electric vehicle technology will be lifted over the southern border. It is very much a \u201cSpiderman pointing at Spiderman\u201d type situation. From the article: Domestic automakers require approval from China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commerce ministry to manufacture overseas and it has yet to give approval, according to two people familiar with the matter. Authorities feared Mexico would gain unrestricted access to BYD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advanced technology and knowhow, they said, even possibly allowing US access to it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe commerce ministry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest concern is Mexico\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proximity to the US,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said one of the people. BYD has quickly trounced Tesla in the electric vehicle market, selling 3.4 million vehicles in 2024 compared to Tesla\u2019s 1.7 million, and is continuing to grow at a rapid pace while Elon Musk\u2019s company faces declining sales globally. The Chinese company, which started in 1995 supplying batteries to other electronics manufacturers, has released a range of affordable electric cars and this week announced new battery technology that can charge a vehicle in just five minutes. Its self-driving system, called \u201cGod\u2019s Eye,\u201d will also be made available for free across its entire lineup in the near future. Maybe that is technology Musk would like to get his hands on. While there exists substantial evidence that Chinese companies steal intellectual property\u00e2\u0080\u0094stories of Chinese engineers fleeing America with thumb drives of confidential documents abound\u00e2\u0080\u0094it is also true that China is masterful at executing when the one-party authoritarian nation decides to prioritize an industry. It is hard to argue with the success of BYD, and its cars have received strong reviews. The growth of BYD has been fueled by substantial government support in China, and a large domestic market to sell its cars into. BYD has been expanding globally, however, which is unusual. The company sold 40,000 vehicles in Mexico last year and has become a major player in Brazil and Europe as well. Factories could help China further develop soft power abroad similar to the way its Belt and Road project has seen the country support infrastructure development in other countries. The U.S. meanwhile is falling behind in the global automotive industry where it once dominated, as Musk supports cutbacks on EV subsidies just as the industry was really starting to take off. Some critics have speculated that Musk\u2019s real intention is to hamper rivals like GM and Ford, who still have yet to reach profitability in their EV businesses while Tesla has managed to become profitable on a per-unit basis. Either way, China is taking a clear lead in EVs domestically and abroad while the United States focuses on more dubious priorities, namely crypto and AI. On the current trajectory, ten years from now Americans traveling abroad are going to look at Chinese electric cars like Boris Yeltsin looked at American grocery stores BYD has some challenges abroad, as the Financial Times noted. BYD has been subject to accusations of slave labor conditions in its international factories, for one. And President Trump is still able to flex American power by threatening countries including Mexico that allow Chinese players to grow. BYD committed in 2024 to building a factory in Mexico but is now less committed as the government there seeks to placate the Trump administration. Tariffs are not as much of an issue as BYD does not sell into the United States due to government restrictions here, though if you want to get an electric vehicle at a rock bottom price, you might be able to drive over the border and pick up a BYD Dolphin Mini Plus. The car has an estimated driving range of 252 miles and retails for $23,000\u00e2\u0080\u0094essentially the exact type of vehicle many Tesla fans hoped it would make.  bydChinaElectric carsTESLA  \r           Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r          \r           News from the future, delivered to your present.\r          \r       Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r                 Elon Musk told Fox News \"they basically want to kill me\" when discussing opposition to Tesla.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"     The Federal Reserve's second policy meeting of the year won't change much for mortgage rates in the near term.    The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at its monetary policy meeting this week \u2014 though sticky inflation, increased unemployment and slowing economic growth could force the central bank to cut rates in late spring or early summer.\u00a0 As recession fears mount and uncertain trade policies pressure financial markets, the key question for investors was how the Trump administration's economic austerity measures and tariffs would\u00a0influence the Fed's\u00a0interest rate forecast.\u00a0 \"Policy is not on a preset course,\" Fed chair Jerome Powell said during Wednesday's press conference. \"We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance, and we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\" The Fed is tasked with maintaining maximum employment and containing inflation. A sluggish economy typically warrants interest rate cuts to stimulate growth, but lowering rates too quickly could fuel price growth when inflation is still above target.\u00a0 Still, the Federal Reserve, which sets a short-term benchmark interest rate for lenders, only\u00a0indirectly impacts the mortgage market. In 2024, the central bank cut interest rates three times, but mortgage\u00a0rates didn't fall. That's because rates are primarily driven by movement in the bond market, specifically on the 10-year Treasury yield. Bond yields and interest rates rise or fall depending on how\u00a0new economic data\u00a0shifts market speculation and risk assessment. Until the impact of the administration's policies is clearer, mortgage rates will continue to fluctuate.\u00a0 Read more: How the Federal Reserve's Decision Impacts Mortgage Rates Fannie Mae projects mortgage\u00a0rates to stay above 6.5%\u00a0for the better part of the year. Yet lenders base their rates on a range of factors, and no forecast is set in stone. Given the precarious nature of the economy, any sign of risk or disruption could lower bond yields and impact the trajectory of mortgage rates.\u00a0 If an economic downturn appears likely, for example, mortgage rates could start decreasing, but they would need to drop closer to 5.5% to bring buyers into the market at scale, according to\u00a0Alex Thomas, senior research analyst at John Burns Research and Consulting.\u00a0 While cheaper home loan rates are positive for housing affordability, a shaky economy could keep the housing market frozen. \"If lower mortgage rates are the result of a recession, housing demand could remain muted,\" said Thomas. Prospective homebuyers who have been\u00a0waiting for mortgage rates to drop\u00a0for the past few years may need to adjust to the \"new normal\" in the mortgage market, with rates fluctuating between 5% and 7% over the longer term. That may seem high compared to the recent\u00a02% rates\u00a0of the pandemic era. But experts say getting below 3% on a mortgage is unlikely without a severe economic downturn. Since the 1970s, the average rate for a\u00a030-year fixed mortgage\u00a0has been around 7%.\u00a0 Today's\u00a0unaffordable housing market\u00a0isn't just a result of high mortgage rates. A\u00a0long-standing housing shortage, expensive home prices and a loss of purchasing power due to inflation have locked out buyers over the last several years. With the\u00a0spring homebuying season\u00a0fast approaching, prospective homebuyers are left wondering whether to enter the market or continue waiting on the sidelines. It's never a good idea to rush into\u00a0buying a home\u00a0without establishing a clear budget.\u00a0 Here's what experts recommend before purchasing a home:\u00a0 \ud83d\udcb0 Build your credit score. Your credit score will help determine whether you qualify for a mortgage and at what interest rate. A credit score of 740 or higher will help you qualify for a lower rate. \ud83d\udcb0 Save for a bigger down payment.\u00a0A larger down payment allows you to take out a smaller mortgage and get a lower interest rate from your lender. If you can afford it, a down payment of at least 20% will also eliminate private mortgage insurance. \ud83d\udcb0 Shop for mortgage lenders.\u00a0Comparing loan offers from multiple mortgage lenders can help you negotiate a better rate. Experts recommend getting at least two to three loan estimates from different lenders. \ud83d\udcb0 Consider mortgage points.\u00a0You can get a lower mortgage rate by buying mortgage points, with each point costing 1% of the total loan amount. One mortgage point equals a 0.25% decrease in your mortgage rate.","label":0}

It\u2019s never been more clear that the Democratic Party\u2014both activist and rank-and-file wings alike\u2014is spoiling for a fight. The broad feistiness within the party exploded last week after Chuck Schumer helped Republicans pass a nakedly partisan spending plan over the objection of the majority of his fellow Democratic Senators. The moment is giving prominent Democrats their best chance yet to provide their own vision for dragging their party out of its current state of almost-total irrelevance. Advertisement Advertisement The dynamic seems like it is coasting toward a satisfying release of pent-up pressure. It also may matter for naught. The latest polls confirm this is a crisis moment for Democrats. Their brand is at an all-time low. Just 29% of all Americans have a positive view of the party, a 20-point swing from January 2021 when Trump was leaving office and Joe Biden was moving into the White House, according to polling released this week from CNN. Just 63% of Democrats hold positive views of their party.\u00a0 But what\u2019s most revealing is what the party faithful want to see out of its leaders. A whopping 57% of Democrats say their party needs to mainly work to block Republicans\u2019 agenda, a shift from 23% of the same segment who wanted opposition to be the central goal during the first year of Trump\u2019s term. To be clear, this is not 2017, and the current fight is taking on an entirely different shade of contempt. The Resistance may not be showing up like it did for Trump\u2019s first term; that does not mean a more muscular opposition lacks a constituency. There\u2019s no reason to think that this give-\u2019em-hell sentiment is temporary. Those CNN numbers are from a poll taken in the days before almost a dozen Senate Democrats, led by Schumer, helped Republicans avoid a government shutdown. The boiling debate over that fracturing vote is now driving the conversation over how Democrats should move forward. For the party\u2019s leading voices\u2014many of them hopefuls in the 2028 shadow presidential primary\u2014their answer to the Schumer Rorschach test may take on outsized weight. Take Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, who has been not-so-subtly making the pre-2028 rounds. On Tuesday, he stopped by the Center For American Progress for the first of that think tank\u2019s sessions helping navigate the second Trump era. When given a chance to back up Schumer\u2019s vote that kept the government\u2019s lights on facing a midnight deadline at the end of last week, Pritzker took a pass. \u201cLook, he\u2019s the elected Leader,\u201d Pritzker said. \u201cI disagree with what he did and vehemently so. But I also know that he has done good work as a Senate Leader in other ways.\u201d It was artful evasion that might serve him well in town halls up in New Hampshire, where he is already a familiar face in the state that historically held the first-in-the-nation primary and where he will headline the state Democratic Party\u2019s biggest fundraiser next month. The counterpoint to Pritzker\u2019s light touch on Schumer is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has been merciless in her disapproval of Schumer\u2019s decision. Even before Schumer made his alliance with the GOP spending plan official, she was having talks with fellow Democrats about putting in motion a primary challenge against her fellow New Yorker in 2028. Even centrist and middling Democrats were suddenly interested in what a Sen. AOC would look like. Across the political spectrum, there was a sincere uneasiness about how Democrats were moving forward. Rep. Glenn Ivey of Maryland so far is alone in openly calling for Schumer to exit, but he is likely to find companions if things continue apace. Once the run-of-the-mill lawmakers\u2019 consultants can show them polling to prove this isn\u2019t a risky footing, expect plenty of others to follow. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, meanwhile, is working to broaden his base in ways that are either canny or clumsy; the verdict is still out. He urged Senate Democrats to shut the government down rather than give Republicans the win on a spending plan that made deep cuts, but also defended his recent chummy conversation with conservative insiders like Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk. \u201cI think we all agreed after the last election that it\u2019s important for Democrats to explore new and unique ways of talking to people,\u201d Newsom told supporters by email. (Perhaps that stance is why, according to a new book, Trump was terrified to face the California Governor if he were to have replaced Biden on the ticket last year.) For those liberals who\u2019ve already unfollowed Newsom on Bluesky, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz may be more their speed. As Republicans are shutting down town halls to avoid angry constituents, Walz is backfilling with a tour of House districts with Republican incumbents. On the topic of Senate Democrats and shutting down the government, Walz recently put the issue to an Omaha audience, \u201cI get the overwhelming feeling that the vast majority of people wish they would have voted no. Is that true?\u201d The audience erupted with applause. But Walz, who has proven to be a much better player when given a free hand to campaign as he sees best, stayed firmly in the lane of pragmatists. \u201cChuck understands and what folks understand is that a shutdown comes at a hell of a price,\u201d Walz told the local NPR affiliate. That approach also came through during an earlier Walz stop in Des Moines, where he seemed to suggest the search for the party\u2019s next leader is a pointless one. \u201cThere is not going to be a charismatic leader ride in and do this. It is going to be people coming out on a beautiful Friday afternoon, demanding change and holding people accountable.\u201d There is no shortage of others whose recent moves seem less focused on steering the party forward, and more about claiming their space on 2028 bingo cards. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore headlined a white-tie dinner with Washington insiders just this weekend, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg last week passed on a Senate run in Michigan, and no one is taking their eye off Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, or former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper. Then there\u2019s former Vice President Kamala Harris, the substitute for Biden late in the 2024 race who is telling everyone asking that she is likely to make a call on a 2028 race by the end of the summer. All of this is feeding the still-in-the-womb 2028 background rumbling inside the opposition party that is sharply divided over just how much capital-O opposing needs to be done, and to what ends. Trump will remain a driving force for the foreseeable future. Unlike Republicans, who this week telegraphed that they were ready to stay the course for 2028 when they made Vice President J.D. Vance the Republican National Committee\u2019s chief fundraiser, the Democrats do not have a unified understanding of how to handle the coming months, let alone the midterms or 2028. If they do not find a general map, their time in the wilderness will continue to be completely dictated by Trump and his allies. But as the internal bickering drags on, all weary voters are seeing is a party with no shortage of talk about fighting Trump, but without a steady notion of how to actually do it.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Business Insider Edition  It seems like Palmer Luckey gets where Tim Cook is trying to go with the Apple Vision Pro.  The Oculus founder and Anduril CEO shared his analysis of Apple's foray into mixed-reality headsets during an episode of the \"What's News\" podcast. Luckey said he's been \"consistent\" in his stance on the future of the pricey device since before it launched.               \"I was telling people, 'Listen, you have to realize that what Apple's doing here is not trying to, with their first release, try to make something that is for everybody,'\" Luckey said.               Instead, he said, Apple is \"trying to set a very high standard\" with the $3,500 mixed reality headset.               The low demand for the Vision Pro since its release in February 2023 has reflected Luckey's assertion that the device doesn't seem to be catching on with non-tech enthusiasts.               \"'They are trying to drag something out of the future that really shouldn't exist until 2026, 2027, and drag it into the present by making it ludicrously expensive,'\" the billionaire said.               His stance isn't far from Cook's own words about his product, which is pricier than competing headsets yet lacks a killer app to attract more customers. The Vision Pro isn't \"a mass-market product,\" but rather for \"people who want to have tomorrow's technology today,\" the Apple CEO told The Wall Street Journal in October 2024.               Luckey got his big break in VR when Meta, then Facebook, bought Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion in cash, and he maintained his optimism about the industry.               \"You're going to see major players launching productivity applications, gaming applications, entertainment applications,\" Luckey said during the interview.               Representatives for Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Business Insider Edition  Americans aren't getting any more interest-rate cuts just yet.          On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee announced that it would hold interest rates steady for the second time this year, falling in line with market predictions.               It follows the latest consumer price index data, which found that inflation increased 2.8% year-over-year in February, below January's 3% rate. It marks a step closer to achieving the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target. CME FedWatch, which estimates interest-rate changes based on market moves, projected a 99% chance the Fed would hold rates steady since the inflation data release.               Fed Chair Jerome Powell told reporters during a January press conference that even with positive inflation readings, the central bank is still \"very much in the mode of waiting to see\" how President Donald Trump's policies will impact the economy.               \"We'll patiently watch and understand and not be in a hurry to get to a place of understanding what our policy response should be until we see how it plays out,\" Powell said.               Since taking office, Trump has both implemented new tariffs and used them as tools to achieve policy goals. On March 12, his 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports went into effect, a day after he eased off of his threat to double the 25% tariff on those metals from Canada until the country agreed to pause its tax on electricity exports to the US.               The back-and-forth nature of the tariffs so far has made it difficult for the Fed to determine how Trump's trade policy will impact the central bank's interest rate decisions, Powell said in January.               \"We don't know what's going to be tariffed. We don't know for how long or how much, what countries. We don't know about retaliation. We don't know how it's going to transmit through the economy to consumers. That really does remain to be seen,\" Powell said.               The FOMC penciled in two interest-rate cuts in 2025, but the Fed could change course depending on how the economy takes shape over the rest of the year. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, said in a statement that \"stubborn inflation and recent economic uncertainty will make them ever more data-dependent in the coming weeks and months.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Business Insider Edition  The Nordic adtech company Adform is exploring a sale, four people familiar with its plans told Business Insider. A deal would mark the latest sign that the adtech M&A market is bouncing back after a couple of tepid years.          The four people said Adform had appointed Carnegie, a Swedish investment bank, to lead the process. They asked for anonymity to protect their business relationships; their identities are known to BI.               One of those people said Adform asked prospective buyers to submit their bids in April.               Adform and Carnegie declined to comment.               Founded in Denmark in 2002, Adform is one of the oldest independent adtech companies. Unlike many of its competitors, which tend to focus on either the advertiser side or publisher side of ad transactions, Adform offers solutions for both.               Those include a demand-side platform that helps advertisers buy and manage their ad campaigns across various media channels, data management platforms that help both advertisers and publishers organize their data, and ad servers where its clients can store their ads and track their campaigns.               Those assets could be attractive to other adtech companies, private equity firms, or the growing number of companies that have recently launched so-called retail media and commerce media businesses, such as supermarkets, e-commerce platforms, apps, and travel and leisure companies.               While it's been around a long time, Adform has struggled to gain the kind of traction in the market enjoyed by its US rivals, such as Google and The Trade Desk.               Adform reported revenue of 88.6 million euros, around $97 million, in 2023, down 3.7% from the prior year, according to its most recently published annual report. The company said the decline reflected economic uncertainty that led to advertisers reducing their marketing spend. \"EBITDA before special earnings,\" its measure of profitability, came in at 16.9 million euros, or around $18.5 million. The company said it employed around 669 employees on average throughout 2023.               Adform had once planned to go public with hopes of raising $100 million, but it shelved its initial public offering in 2018, blaming the volatility in the financial markets at the time. The company has long been the subject of potential takeover rumors.               The adtech M&A market appears to be revving back into action after a quiet couple of years marred by ad spend slowdowns, economic volatility, and uncertainty around the impact of privacy and policy changes from the likes of Apple and Google.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"The latest market research has not been kind to VR headsets, and the Apple Vision Pro is the headset that suffered the biggest drop in market share. According to a new market update, the global VR market declined by 12% year-over-year in 2024, showing that the adoption of these headsets is slowing instead of picking up pace. The updates come from Counterpoint, a research firm. According to its latest findings, people just aren\u2019t that into VR headsets anymore. Despite the way the tech has evolved in the last few years, shipments of VR headsets are dropping instead of rising. It\u2019s worth noting that shipments don\u2019t directly translate to sales. We don\u2019t know how many headsets have actually been sold, but what we do know is that retailers seemingly had no need for frequent restocks, hence the drop in shipments \u2014 and that points to declining sales, too, but those numbers are hardly ever made available to the public. With that disclaimer out of the way, let\u2019s dig in. The global VR headset shipments fell by 12% year-over-year, and this is the third consecutive year of declines. Comparing the final quarter of 2024 to the final quarter of 2023 also revealed a 5% drop. Counterpoint cites hardware limitations and the fact that there\u2019s just not enough exciting VR content readily available as some of the reasons why the market is in decline. The company notes that the enterprise market is doing better, although it hasn\u2019t shared any numbers on that. Meta, with headsets such as the Quest 3S, dominates the VR headset market, achieving a share of 77% in 2024. That share was even better in the fourth quarter of the year, when Meta headsets accounted for 84% of the market. While Meta is soaring, the Apple Vision Pro is struggling to gain market share. The shipments of Apple\u2019s flagship headset dropped by 43% quarter-over-quarter, indicating that many people might not be willing to spend over $3,500 on a VR headset. Apple hasn\u2019t quite tasted the domain-shifting success it expected with the Vision Pro headset. A price tag worth $3,500 was already a deterrent, but the gaming ecosystem \u2014 a key driver for the VR segment \u2014 has also been lackluster. The company is now hoping to fix that situation with some help from Sony. According to Bloomberg, the two companies have been working together to bring support for the PlayStation VR 2\u2019s controllers to the pricey Apple headset. \u201cApple has discussed the plan with third-party developers, asking them if they\u2019d integrate support into their games,\u201d adds the report. Apple\u2019s foray into the XR wearable segment may not have stirred the same kind of success that it tasted with the likes of the iPhone or the Apple Watch, but the company is still moving ahead with future iterations. While plans of a cheaper headset may have been pushed, the Vision Pro could get a successor within a year, or so. In the latest edition of his PowerOn newsletter, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman writes that Apple might introduce the second-generation Vision Pro headset somewhere between fall 2025 and spring 2026. That window puts the official reveal in roughly the same frame as the launch of updated iPhones and the sporadic Mac hardware. Apple has been stuck in an innovation rut for the past few years. Aside from the Vision Pro headset \u2014 which expectedly didn\u2019t gain a mass reception \u2014 the company hasn\u2019t made any notable hardware strides apart from its bread-and-butter mobility and computing portfolio. That could change in the next few years. According to Bloomberg, Apple\u2019s Vision Pro team is working on smart glasses to tackle the challenge presented by a resurgent Meta. The social media giant has already scored an early lead with the well-received Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses, which have steadily received meaningful social and AI upgrades.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"February saw the launch of a bunch of big, next-gen only releases including Monster Hunter Wilds, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and Avowed, but despite a month littered with new games, new console sales continue to lag. In fact, last month was reportedly the lowest point for gaming hardware sales since before the pandemic.  That\u2019s according to the latest data from market research group Circana. The firm\u2019s executive director for video game analysis, Mat Piscatella, released February\u2019s sales data for the U.S. video game industry showing that while it was a great month for new game releases, new console sales are still in a slump. Overall video game hardware spending was just $256 million, down 25 percent from the prior year. \u201cThis is the lowest February total for video game hardware spending since the $184 million reached in February 2020,\u201d he wrote. Five years ago, the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were both on their last legs and players awaited the next-gen consoles that fall, while Switch sales would explode a few months later with the release of Animal Crossing: New Horizons just as people were in lockdown for covid-19.  In 2025, Nintendo fans are waiting for the Switch 2  and both the PS5 and Xbox Series X\/S are in the back half of their lifespans. One of them, however, is doing a lot better than the other. \u201cAfter each platform\u2019s first 52 months in market, PlayStation 5 unit sales exceed PlayStation 4\u2019s sales pace by 7 percent, while Xbox Series now trails Xbox One by 19 percent,\u201d Piscatella wrote.  One way to look at those numbers is that the PS5 continues to dominate despite never getting a price cut (in fact its all-digital slim model costs $50 more than at launch). At the same time, it\u2019s also seems clear that not everyone who\u2019s decided to forgo an Xbox Series X\/S is buying Sony\u2019s console instead. Many analysts, including Piscatella, also predict that the Switch 2 will struggle to match the sales figures of its predecessor.  Have gaming consoles peaked? The Switch 2 isn\u2019t the only major variable involved in that question, the answer to which could have big consequences for whether the gaming industry\u2019s current ambient doom spiral continues. Grand Theft Auto VI is also coming this fall and expected to drive tons of people to pick up new consoles, including the millions still playing on last-gen hardware. Whether that\u2019s enough to increase overall console adoption or not remains an open question though, even if the consoles and dedicated handhelds themselves are just becoming more and more like gaming PCs in disguise.  .","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Tesla is having a tough year. Once a world leader in the electric-vehicle market, the company\u2019s sales across the U.S., China, and several European countries fell year on year in February, and its stock price dropped almost 50% from a mid-December peak. Tesla needs India more than India needs Tesla. The politics of Tesla leader Elon Musk and surging Chinese rivals are both contributing to the sales slump. In Germany, where Musk supported the right-wing populist party, Tesla\u2019s sales collapsed 76% last month. In the U.S., following Musk\u2019s support for President Donald Trump, the company saw a 6% decline. In China, where Shenzhen-based BYDiBYDBYD Auto is a Chinese carmaker that became the world\u2019s leading EV manufacturer in 2023, competing with Tesla for market share and global attention.READ MORE is the biggest-selling EV brand, Tesla\u2019s sales fell 49%. Tesla, meanwhile, is ramping up its presence in the emerging economies. It is opening its maiden stores in India and Saudi Arabia, and setting up an office in South Africa. Entering new markets, however, may not solve Tesla\u2019s woes as it is likely to face tough competition from Chinese carmakers and several homegrown companies, which have dug their heels deep in their countries. Tesla\u2019s steep pricing and limited product options are unlikely to woo buyers in these new markets, according to EV industry experts. \u201cTesla needs India more than India needs Tesla,\u201d Ravi Gadepalli, founder of mobility advisory firm Transit Intelligence, told Rest of World. There are several reasons why the world\u2019s third-largest market will be an uphill battle for the company. Local automobile giant Tata Motors has grabbed over 60% of the Indian market with its popular and economically priced electric cars. China\u2019s BYD and MG Motor also rank among the top five EV sellers in the country. The automakers have rapidly grown in India by partnering with ride-hailing companies.\u00a0 \u201cIndian automakers, especially Tata, already have a strong foothold in the EV market,\u201d Jayapradeep Vasudevan, chief business officer of Indian electric-motorcycle maker Raptee.HV, told Rest of World. \u201cMoreover, Tata\u2019s diverse EV lineup and future expansion plans across different vehicle segments position them well to handle the competitive pressure from Tesla\u2019s entry.\u201d While Tesla would have to build its presence from the ground up, Tata already has an established distribution network and customer service capabilities across urban and rural India, which give the company a significant advantage, Vasudevan said. Musk has been hinting at an India entry since 2016, but that hasn\u2019t materialized as Tesla failed to negotiate lower import taxes with the government. This might change soon. Last month, Musk met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington, where they discussed space technology, mobility, and innovation. On March 11, India\u2019s largest telecom companies, Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, announced partnerships with Musk\u2019s satellite company Starlink, which has so far struggled to get a license to operate in the country. Tesla did not reply to a request for comment for this story. By comparison, Tesla products look rather staid and stale to Chinese and Asian consumers, who have a penchant for new things. Chinese makers have been quick to innovate, with BYD this week unveiling a lineup of vehicles it says can charge\u00a0almost as fast\u00a0as it takes to refuel a regular car. Chinese brands\u2019 success in emerging markets is largely due to their pricing strategy and the variety of models they offer. Tesla is yet to match up to that, John J\u00f6rn Stech, an international automotive expert and principal consultant at New York-based Shiftgate Consulting, told Rest of World. \u201cChinese rivals are rolling out new models continuously and making updates to their products,\u201d Stech said. \u201cBy comparison, Tesla products look rather staid and stale to Chinese and Asian consumers, who have a penchant for new things.\u201d Tesla is available in several Southeast Asian markets but lags behind Chinese players in most. For instance, in Thailand, the region\u2019s largest EV market, the top five EV brands in 2024 were all Chinese, with BYD leading the pack by a wide margin. Tesla came in sixth with just 4,121 cars sold in 2024, compared to more than 27,000 from BYD. There is limited EV sales data available in other Southeast Asian countries, but Tesla ranks second in Malaysia and Singapore in terms of EV sales, and third in Cambodia, according to Martin Schr\u00f6der, associate professor at the College of Policy Science at Ritsumeikan University. \u201cTesla has been under pressure in Asia as competition from Chinese rivals has picked up dramatically over the past two years,\u201d Stech said. \u201cGiven the nearly 50% drop in deliveries in China, plummeting sales in Europe, and a likely drop in sales in the U.S., it is unlikely Tesla will look for expansion markets. They have to fix the markets where they already made significant investments.\u201d In Saudi Arabia, Tesla is planning to open its first \u201cpop-up stores\u201d and at least one showroom soon. Reports in South African media in January said Tesla is close to setting up an office in the country. But this might be too little, too late. Saudi Arabia, for instance, is backing other EV companies, which might give them an edge. Until 2019, Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, held more than 8.2 million shares in Tesla. It sold most of the shares in 2019, and has since backed American EV maker Lucid Motors as well as Ceer, an automobile manufacturer formed under a joint venture between the sovereign fund and China\u2019s Foxconn. Last year, Lucid officially opened the first car-manufacturing facility in Saudi Arabia. One market where Tesla has found success is the United Arab Emirates, where the company has set up supercharger networks across major cities. The country has embraced the luxury positioning of Tesla\u2019s cars, and the company, along with other EV players, has benefited from government incentives like free public charging, preferential parking, and exemptions on registration fees.","label":0}

We're at a point where passively cooled mini-pcs that cost less than 2000 Euros are closing in on the Petaflops range. With system clocks sometimes exceeding 5GHz, RAM clocks doubling or even quadrupling that and single desktop CPU dies come with 64 cores and a GFX unit built in. With standard mini-boards that can shove Terabytes around in seconds. I'm writing this on an older Tuxedo laptop with 24GB RAM and 1TB of storage, with two screens and a bizarre range of applications running that each waste obscene amounts of resources because these days everything that renders pixels to a screen has to lug around it's own 50MB of an electron stack even if it's only a glorified and hideously bloated Xchat client rippoff with with nice colorful animations. And the computer doesn't even budge. The fan only spins up when I'm doing an Ubuntu update or compiling something big in the summer. If I need my private AI Bot\/Assistant\/Buddy my requirements might grow again and catch up with current state of the art but for now I'm more than good. I still clearly remember my Cyrix P200+ with a 75Mhz sysclock, the first desktop CPU that needed a fan, smaller than a matchbox, and its 32MB of RAM. We've come a  long way since then and then at least trippled everything we had wished for. I can say for sure that I'm totally OK and certainly do not need yet another bus upgrade for my computing needs. And I expect it to stay that way with an 80-90% chance. My 2 cents. ... get yourself a better computer. https:\/\/www.perturb.org\/images... [perturb.org] :-) It's such a pain to get a motherboard with expansion slots these days, that doesn't cost a king's ransom. Back in the PCI days, a motherboard would have 4-8 slots, and they all worked, all the time. Buy card -> add card -> install driver -> use card. Done. Now, it's a game of whack-a-mole... The motherboard has four slots - an x16, an x8, and 2 x1's. The X16 ratchets down to x8 if the x8 slot is also occupied. The first x1 slot is useless because it's immediately adjacent to the x16 slot, so the GPU fans cover it. The only way you can use it is if the GPU is in the x8 slot, which isn't a win because the second x1 slot is itself immediately adjacent to the x8.Meanwhile, the x8 slot shares its bandwidth with one of the NVMe slots, so if there's an NVMe drive on the board, it ratchets down to x4, but if the x16 slot is populated AND the first NVMe slot is populated, then the x8 slot doesn't work at all. This leaves one working x1 slot, but shoot me now, it's not one of the open-ended ones, so I can't fit this x4 card in and let it run at x1 speeds, so I have to buy a new x1 variant of the x4 card I already have, slap it in and realize that the HBA cables aren't long enough to reach the drives, but it's the only slot that it'll work in...so I get a longer HBA cable and oh, the processor only has 24 PCIe lanes, which are taken up by the x16 slot, the two NVMe drives, and the northbridge...which apparently, needs the bandwidth for the completely empty SATA ports, but I *can* get it to work if I upgrade my processor to one with 28 lanes, which then requires a firmware upgrade to work, but I can't get the machine to boot into BIOS to do the update because I returned the 24-lane processor, and OH FFS....... NONE of this, of course, is ever described on the box, nor documented in the manual, nor is it configurable in the BIOS so I can at least make some choices and visualize what will and won't work. No, one must search around and hope that some Redditor is in the same boat and took the time to map it out and document it online. The way around this, of course, is to get a Threadripper CPU that costs $1,500, to power the $1,200 motherboard that has 8 x16 slots that all work, but now the power usage doubles and you need an eATX case to fit it, which doesn't fit on the desk anymore, and OH FFS... What I would *love*, is for a motherboard that handled quantity over quality. Do I need PCIe 7? no...but if PCIe 7 has octuple the throughput of PCIe 4, and I've got 24 lanes of PCIe 7 from the CPU, make a motherboard that makes it function like 192 lanes of PCIe 4. Give me 8 full-length PCIe 4 slots, 4 NVMe slots, and give the rest to the Northbridge. Every single slot and port works, regardless of what else is populated. I'll take some variants of this - give me a motherboard that's got only one PCIe slot, but fill the rest of the board up with NVMe slots. Can I fit a dozen? Because I want a ludicrously-fast NVMe NAS without having to buy PCIe switches at $300 a pop. An 8-slot board is pretty much guaranteed to be eATX; I'll take a variant that has 6 slots that's standard ATX size with the same principle. Ultimately, I'd love nothing more than a desktop motherboard that isn't a game of musical slots.... I posed a similar question on hardware forums a while ago and got slammed for it. Basically, I queried why do motherboards have everything built-in and permanently consuming lanes, and then having their tech becoming obsolete, instead of just having more slots with said functionality on add-in cards. That way manufacturers wouldn't need so many different SKUs for different configurations, it'd just be a handful of motherboards with different bundled add-in cards (essentially modern Super-IO cards) for the WI  Many things that used to require a card can be done cheaply through USB nowadays: ethernet, audio, wifi, bluetooth, hdmi and more. The need for many PCI slots has become rather niche, and niche is premium. I understand you want higher end performance but most folks do not need better than 1Gbps networking within the house. I would like a 10Gbps network in my house but I'm not able to justify the premium, just like I don't really *need* a sports car. Back in the PCI days, a motherboard would have 4-8 slots, and they all worked, all the time. Buy card -> add card -> install driver -> use card. Done.The old days had wildly different requirements. It's been a *LONG* time since I've seen a PC with more than a GPU in it. That's the target market for motherboard vendors. On the flip side I fondly remember a P200 MMX with a Matrox GPU, Voodoo 2 video accelerator, Soundblaster AWE32, and a 56k modem card. That was the bare minimum required for a gaming PC. I added a 10base2 network at some point and then when USB was released I realised I was out of upgrade options and didn't have a spot for the card since I  Back in the PCI days, a motherboard would have 4-8 slots, and they all worked, all the time.

This is a way of representing the raw line rate of a single PCIE lane.  At a low level, this metric makes sense for those folks designing the PCIE PHYs themselves.  The PCI SIG group will go into great detail into the PHY link, so in that context, this metric makes sense. err... wtf is this metric?It is a clue that you are not getting 128gb\/s but something less because some of those transfers are protocol overhead rather than user data.

PCIe 6 needs that because its signaling scheme is PAM4 instead of binary NRZ, which in turn means (all things considered) a much higher bit error rate. There is nothing \"stuck\" about being on PCIe Gen 5 at home. There is literally NO hardware in the consumer market that uses that much bandwidth, not even remotely close.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Finally, some good news for Tesla (TSLA+5.27%). The EV maker\u2019s stock popped  during pre-market trading on Wednesday after a Wall Street analyst recommended buying the company\u2019s recent stock dip.  Shares rose about 3% in early trading after Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Andres Sheppard upgraded Tesla from \u201cneutral\u201d (hold) to \u201coverweight\u201d (buy). Sheppard wrote that \u201cthe recent selloff represents an attractive entry point for investors,\u201d Barron\u2019s reported. Sheppard pointed to several upcoming milestones that could drive Tesla\u2019s stock  the coming months. These milestones include the company\u2019s planned rollout of its full self-driving (FSD) feature in China this quarter and in Europe in the first half of 2025; the launch of a robotaxi service in the second half of 2025; the release of a new vehicle model later that year; and the start of robot production and sales in 2026. It\u2019s worth noting that Cantor Fitzgerald was led for decades by Howard Lutnick, until he was named Commerce Secretary by President Donald Trump this year. Trump also appointed Tesla CEO Elon Musk to lead the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). In recent weeks, Trump has publicly supported Musk, including by purchasing and showcasing a Tesla at the White House. But many investors blame Musk\u2019s close ties to the president for Tesla\u2019s recent struggles. Tesla stock fell 5.3% Tuesday and has plunged 36% over the past month \u2014 and by more than half from its all-time high in mid-December. This has wiped billion of dollars from Musk\u2019s net worth, about 60% of which is tied to Tesla shares and options. Still, Tesla received another piece of good news this week. On Tuesday, California regulators granted the company a permit to operate a ride-hailing service in the state, a key step in its push to develop a fleet of autonomous robotaxis.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Business Insider Edition  Investors are quietly searching for beaten-down Russian assets that could surge in value if a peace deal is struck and capital floods back into the country. It won't be easy money.          Traders have been snapping up shares of foreign-listed Russian companies and bought Kazakhstan's tenge currency as a ruble proxy, Bloomberg reported. Wall Street banks have been hunting Russian corporate bonds to satisfy demand from Middle Eastern family offices, and pitching their clients on ruble-linked derivative contracts called \"non-deliverable forwards\" that bypass sanctions, per the outlet.               \"There's an aggressive search for securities of Russian issuers around the world,\" Moscow-based investment banker Evgeny Kogan told Bloomberg. \"Investors in general are asking how quickly they can enter the Russian market.\"               Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 sent investors scattering and spurred Western countries to impose sanctions that have choked Russia's banking sector and wider economy.                US President Donald Trump is working to broker an end to the war and spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, but the pair couldn't reach terms on a cease-fire meaning further negotiations lie ahead.               Eswar Prasad, a senior professor of trade policy at Cornell University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told Business Insider: \"The prospect of a peace deal and the lifting of sanctions on Russia is likely to result in a wave of financial capital flowing into the country in the hopes of profiting from rebounds of its economy, financial markets, and currency.\"               Trump's confidence that a truce isn't far away has contributed to the Russian ruble rising more than 20% against the dollar this year. The currency is now the strongest it's been in more than seven months.               However, a combination of sanctions and internal controls has made it tricky for Western institutional investors to bet on Russia. That has fueled demand for non-deliverable forwards that don't involve any Russian nationals or physical assets.               \"The main ruble trade is in the NDF market but it is largely hedge funds participating in this trade due to the relatively low liquidity,\" Roger Mark, a fixed-income analyst at Ninety One, told BI.               \"The rationale is clear \u2014 potential spot appreciation on the hope of the war ending and a normalization in Russia's economic relationship with the US\/West,\" he said.               Still, Mark cautioned that a cease-fire is far from assured, Trump could still escalate sanctions against Moscow, the ruble has strengthened considerably already, and reopening Russia to the world could lead to capital flowing out instead of in.               \"With sanctions risks still meaningful amid an uncertain policy outlook, it remains a high-risk currency for institutional investors to allocate to, especially given its poor liquidity and off-benchmark nature,\" Mark said.               Betting on Russian assets also poses legal and reputational risks to investors if they act too soon, and even if Russia and Ukraine lay down arms, there's no guarantee that conflict won't flare up again.               \"Uncertainty about the durability of any peace deal and the possibility of the reimposition of sanctions in the future could restrain such capital inflows into Russia, once the initial euphoria has passed,\" Prasad said.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Take that, scalpers. AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D stock has finally caught up to demand. Here's where to buy the best CPU for gaming.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D is widely regarded as the best gaming CPU you can possibly buy in 2025, and up until now it's been on the endangered list due to that very designation. The processor, complete with AMD's proprietary 3D V-Cache technology that specifically and significantly boosts performance in games, launched at a $479 MSRP and quickly sold out everywhere. Since then, there have been a lucky few to snag the chip at the regular price. That's changed in the last couple of days, with major retailers returning to form with what appears to be plenty of stock without any price gouging. Sure, scalpers have been selling chips at a higher price and there have been a number of 9800X3D scams preying on eager buyers, but you can once again safely buy the CPU.  The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is in stock at the time of writing at Best Buy, Newegg, and Amazon. All three offer the same $479 price tag. What makes this CPU so good, especially for gaming? I'll let Windows Central Senior Editor Ben Wilson explain with this quote pulled from his Ryzen 7 9800X3D review: \"AMD continues the theme with its second generation of 3D V-Cache to deliver unparalleled gaming performance and middling productivity. Thankfully, most gamers do not care about the benchmark-breaking number crunching as long as they get their framerate boosts, and the Ryzen 7 9800X3D delivers that sweet extra FPS.\" Even compared to Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K flagship (which we also reviewed), the 9800X3D is the superior chip as long as you don't aim to handle productivity and creative work on the same PC.  I'm one of the lucky ones who managed to buy a 9800X3D on launch day at MSRP, and it's been going strong in my gaming PC ever since. It's the CPU I recommend to all of my gaming friends who are looking to upgrade, and it's going to be a lot easier to convince them now that it's returned to a steady price with what looks like plenty of stock. AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D The Ryzen 7 9800X3D remains the best CPU for PC gamers in 2025, and its return to MSRP with stock at various retailers bodes well for builders. \ud83d\udc49 See at: Best Buy | Newegg | Amazon All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team , Contributor.  TXN Stock   Question: How would you react if you held Texas Instruments stock (NASDAQ: TXN) and its value dropped by 30% or more in the coming months? While this scenario might seem drastic, it has happened before and could occur again. Texas Instruments stock has recently shown mixed performance\u2014it has fallen about 4% year-to-date in 2025 while gaining roughly 6% over the past 12 months. In contrast, the S&P 500 has risen about 10% during the same period. Even though the broader semiconductor industry has improved somewhat, driven by a surge in demand for artificial intelligence chips and a modest recovery in the personal computer market, Texas Instruments has faced challenges in its key automotive and industrial segments. Moreover, the overall market is experiencing a significant sell-off, spurred by growing concerns over a U.S. recession following tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on major trading partners. Since demand for Texas Instruments products is closely tied to the overall economy and industrial activity, the stock could see a sharp correction if a downturn occurs. Here\u2019s the point: The main takeaway is that during a downturn, Texas Instruments stock could suffer significant losses. Data from 2020 shows that TXN stock lost about 30% of its value in just a few quarters and experienced a peak-to-trough decline of roughly 22% during the 2022 financial crisis\u2014performing a bit worse than the S&P 500. This raises the question: Could the stock fall as low as $125 if a similar situation unfolds? Naturally, individual stocks are generally more volatile than diversified portfolios. Therefore, if you are seeking growth with lower volatility, you might consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns of over 91% since its inception. Texas Instruments\u2019 financial performance has been mixed in recent quarters. In the automotive sector, customers have been cutting down on inventory built up during pandemic-related supply chain issues. The industrial segment\u2014which includes analog products such as amplifiers, power management devices, microcontrollers, and specialized processors\u2014is also showing some weakness. Additionally, the communications equipment sector reduced purchases due to a slowdown in 5G network deployment, particularly in the U.S. Furthermore, Texas Instruments\u2019 gross margins have come under pressure because of slightly higher production costs associated with reduced factory utilization. In 2024, gross margins were roughly 58%, down from about 62% the previous year. President Donald Trump\u2019s assertive tariff policies\u2014including a 20% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with stricter immigration restrictions\u2014have raised concerns that inflation might return. All of this suggests that the U.S. economy could face significant challenges and even a recession \u2013 our analysis here on the macro picture. In fact, during an interview last week, the President did not rule out the possibility that new tariffs might trigger a recession. Given the heightened uncertainty from the Trump administration\u2019s policies, these risks are especially critical. Moreover, the ongoing Ukraine\u2013Russia war and global trade tensions further obscure the economic outlook. Tariffs drive up import costs, leading to higher prices, reduced disposable income, and weaker consumer spending. This could impact TXN, as the company\u2019s product lineup is more dependent on macroeconomic factors than other parts of the semiconductor industry. For perspective, industrial and automotive chips\u2014which are highly cyclical\u2014account for over two-thirds of Texas Instruments\u2019 revenue. TXN stock has experienced an impact that was slightly worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. Concerned about the effects of a market crash on TXN stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Texas Instruments Stock Go In A Market Crash? provides a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. \u2022 TXN stock declined 22.3% from a high of $191.01 on 29 March 2022 to $148.34 on 16 October 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough drop of 25.4% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 14 May 2024  \u2022 Subsequently, the stock rose to a high of $220.29 on 10 November 2024 and is currently trading at around $180 \u2022 TXN stock dropped 29.8% from a high of $133.13 on 19 February 2020 to $93.50 on 16 March 2020, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 17 July 2020 \u2022 TXN stock declined 62.4% from a high of $36.59 on 9 October 2007 to $13.77 on 2 March 2009, compared to a peak-to-trough drop of 56.8% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 2 May 2013 At its current price of approximately $180 per share, TXN is trading at around 34x consensus 2025 earnings, which may appear somewhat expensive. Additionally, the company\u2019s growth rates have been moderate. Revenues contracted in 2024 and are projected to grow in the high single digits for 2025. With rising recession risks, the outlook for TXN could become challenging. Given this potential slowdown in growth and the broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself the question: do you plan to hold on to your Texas Instruments stock now, or will you panic and sell if it begins dropping to $150, $125, or even lower? Holding onto a declining stock is never easy.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"The president is boasting about initiatives from before he took office. This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. \u201cEveryone is calling it the\u201d\u2014Donald Trump paused while speaking to a crowd at a rally the day before his inauguration. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say this,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s too braggadocious, but we\u2019ll say it anyway\u2014the Trump effect.\u201d He went on to describe how the stock market was booming and bitcoin prices were surging, and then boasted about a domestic-infrastructure investment from Apple, much of which had already been planned before the November election. In spite of his claims to the contrary, Trump has no qualms about taking credit, including for achievements that were in progress or complete before he took office. The president has taken full responsibility for negotiating a hostage swap and a cease-fire deal in the Israel-Hamas war (Trump posted on social media in mid-January that \u201cthis EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November\u201d), not mentioning that President Joe Biden had announced some of the deal terms last year. The Trump administration said that its policies had quashed migrant border crossings; immigration data are hard to parse, especially for such a short time period, but tallies show that border crossings had already been on the decline during the Biden administration. And this week, Trump credited himself with returning two astronauts who had been stranded for months at the International Space Station; last summer, NASA announced its plan to bring them home in 2025, but Trump still claimed without evidence that Biden \u201cwas embarrassed by what happened, and he said, \u2018Leave them up there.\u2019\u201d Trump relied on similar framing during his campaign: Ahead of a debate with Biden last year, he posted that \u201clow INSULIN PRICING was gotten for millions of Americans by me, and the Trump Administration, not by Crooked Joe Biden,\u201d saying of his opponent that \u201call he does is try to take credit for things done by others, in this case, ME!\u201d Shared credit would have been appropriate here: Trump did sign an executive order in his first term that capped out-of-pocket costs of insulin for some Medicare patients at $35 a month, but Biden expanded this cap to all Medicare drug programs through the Inflation Reduction Act, affecting significantly more patients. Trump enjoyed taking credit for Barack Obama\u2013era achievements during his first term too: In 2017, for example, he claimed credit for Obama\u2019s immigration plan and bragged about a Ford-factory investment that had been in progress since a 2015 union contract. Politicians are storytellers, and Trump is shameless about telling only the version of the story that flatters him. The stock market is thriving under the Biden administration? That\u2019s thanks to projections that Trump will win, he claimed last year (even though economists suggested that such gains were also linked to low unemployment, flagging inflation, and solid growth). The economy is struggling after Trump takes office? Blame the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d situation Biden left him with (even though many economists suggest that recent stock-market downturns are due to anxiety about the effects of Trump\u2019s trade war). Talking about the egg-price crisis in January, the White House team pilloried the Biden administration for killing sick chickens, neglecting to note that this was a tack Trump also took during his first term. Biden struggled to communicate victories during his term, particularly those related to the economy, which left a \u201cvoid\u201d for Trump to fill, Lori Cox Han, a scholar of the presidency at Chapman University, told me. And Americans\u2019 perception that the economy was struggling under Biden, boosted by their personal experience of inflation, affected how they voted. Whenever the White House changes hands, some projects inevitably bleed from one administration into the next. Embracing continuity between terms can be a sign that a president cares more about good policy outcomes than about bucking his predecessor: If a federal initiative is good for Americans, why not continue? But Trump is doing something different\u2014he\u2019s attempting to erase other presidents\u2019 role in policy achievements entirely. Past presidents have also tried to claim credit for a victory set in motion by the previous administration\u2014or perhaps even to hold off the victory until they can take office. The question of whether Ronald Reagan\u2019s aides tried to delay the release of U.S. hostages in Iran so that they could come home during the early days of his administration\u2014with the accompanying photo opportunities\u2014has been discussed for years. Still, Han said, unspoken rules of decorum generally prevent new presidents from claiming full credit or trashing their predecessors. This, she noted, is another norm that Trump has disregarded. Trump has long sought to portray himself as America\u2019s sole savior. Recall his 2016 campaign refrain: \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201d As my colleague Yoni Appelbaum wrote at the time, in beseeching Americans to place trust in him and only him, Trump \u201cbroke with two centuries of American political tradition, in which candidates for office\u2014and above all, for the nation\u2019s highest office\u2014acknowledge their fallibility and limitations, asking for the help of their fellow Americans, and of God, to accomplish what they cannot do on their own.\u201d Trump seems set on sending the message that he doesn\u2019t need help\u2014and that, implausibly, he hasn\u2019t received any along the way.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Boeing\u2019s (BA+7.20%) stock jumped more than 6% after CFO Brian West gave upbeat remarks at the Bank of America (BAC+1.91%) Global Industrials Conference, saying the planemaker is on track with its key success factors for the year, according to a Bloomberg News report. West highlighted progress on manufacturing, citing \u201cfantastic\u201d performance in its push to complete 38 aircraft per month and the stabilization of 787 output at five per month. He didn\u2019t anticipate a material near-term impact from tariffs, but admitted to concerns about parts availability. Wednesday\u2019s increase means the company\u2019s shares are trading roughly unchanged so far this year despite unresolved concerns about the effects of President Donald Trump\u2019s imposed and planned tariffs. The company has many suppliers outside the U.S. and must keep prices contained to be able to effectively compete against Airbus (AIR+1.22%) in the commercial plane market. CEO Kelly Ortberg told staff earlier this month that Trump\u2019s tariffs would boost costs on parts like landing gear that are imported from Canada, Bloomberg News reported. Boeing has a Winnipeg-based division that makes more than 500 parts and assemblies for its commercial unit, and is a  \u201ctier 1\" partner on the 787 Dreamliner, which is assembled in South Carolina. Boeing is also one of the top 10 manufacturers in Mexico and spends up to $1 billion in the nation through its supply chain, according to a company fact sheet. It spends more than $500 million in Mexico each year on commercial airplane parts. Tariffs could create a \u201ccontinuity of supply issue,\u201d Ortberg said. Boeing\u2019s aircraft are made up of thousands of parts subject to demanding specifications, so suppliers aren\u2019t easily replaced. Aerospace expert Jerrold Lundquist recently noted that a Boeing 737 has about 2,000 parts sourced from 700 suppliers. The CEO of the world\u2019s largest aircraft leasing company, AerCap (AER+0.68%), said earlier  that under the worst-case trade war scenario, the price of a 787 could increase by $40 million. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to want to pay that,\u201d Angus Kelley told  told CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box on March 12. \u2014William Gavin contributed to this article.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":" When it was first revealed back in 2019, the Tesla Cybertruck\u00a0was just\u00a0a ridiculously angular truck that nobody thought would ever actually exist. By the time it finally went on sale in December 2023, it had become an emblem of everything wrong with Tesla boss Elon Musk, and over the past year that's only got worse for the big dumb truck. Things have now gotten so bad for Cybertruck owners that they're getting poop and eggs thrown at their stainless steel trucks, and some are resorting to novelty bumper stickers to argue that they aren't fans of Musk anymore, either. If all the abuse has got too bad for your friendly neighborhood Cybertruck owner, then they needn't worry, as there are a handful of other electric pickup trucks out there that aren't half as dumb as Tesla's Cybertruck.  Starting price: $65,090 Range: 240 \u2013 320 miles If you just want a pickup truck that happens to be electric, then the F-150 Lightning is Ford's truck for you. It looks like a regular F-150, drives like a regular F-150 and, despite having to haul around its own weight, is still rated to tow around 8,500 pounds of stuff whenever you need it to. When compared to the Cybertruck, the F-150 Lightning is much more likely to blend in and avoid the assaults of any eco-minded activists that brand trucks like this as greenwashing. It's also much cheaper, but isn't able to charge quite as quickly as Tesla's truck, and can also share its power in an emergency situation through clever tech called bidirectional charging, which the Cybertruck also has.  Price: $71,900 Range: 258 \u2013 420 miles The slickest alternative to the Cybertruck you can buy right now is the R1T electric pickup from Rivian. The American startup's flagship boasts distinctive style, but not in an \"I was designed by a five-year-old\" kind of way, a very usable range and a host of innovative flourishes baked into the design. The R1T produces up to 1,025 hp, more than the Cybertruck; has an 11,000-pound tow capacity, more than the F-150; and comes with a nifty gear tunnel to add in extra storage space, also not offered on any of its rivals. It also starts at nearly $10,000 less than Tesla's offering.  Starting price: $75,195 Range: 390 \u2013 492 miles Prefer your electric pickup truck from a legacy automaker? Then the Silverado EV could be the option for you. The electric iteration of Chevy's iconic truck comes with a little design flair to set it apart from the gas-powered truck, as well as increased range compared with the options from Ford and Rivian \u2014 albeit at a premium. More expensive doesn't always mean more better, however, and while the Silverado EV is an impressive machine, our testing of the truck found that it didn't quite live up to the polish of the F-150 Lightning or Rivian R1T.  Starting price: $91,995 Range: 390 \u2013 460 miles If you want to be able to cover more than 500 miles in your electric truck, then the GMC Sierra EV could be the perfect replacement for your Cybertruck. Based on the same platform as the Silverado EV, GMC's offering comes with more range and a whiff of luxury that you might miss in Chevy's EV. It is, however, a pretty ugly truck and might not appeal to everybody out there. At least its looks might not get you egged, but it's something you'll be aware of while utilizing its 10,000-pound towing claims or its charging speeds of up to 350 kW.  Starting price: $98,845 Range: 282 \u2013 318 miles Like the sound of all that but don't totally want to lose the attention your Cybertruck brings, get a Hummer EV instead. Based on the same platform as Chevy's Silverado and GMC's Sierra trucks, the Hummer EV is a brute that's almost as ridiculous as the Cybertruck. Almost.\u00a0 For pretty much the same price as the Cybertruck, GM will sell you a Hummer with an extra 1,000 pounds of towing capacity, the ability to drive sideways (like a crab), and the largest battery of any EV in America. What more could you want from an enormous electric pickup?\u00a0  Starting price: Unknown\u00a0 Range: 350 miles If you aren't in a rush to abandon your Cybertruck out of fear it'll be the victim of a domestic terrorism, then you could soon swap it for Stellantis' electric truck offering: the Ram 1500 REV. This beast will be the first all-electric pickup from Ram and is slated to launch once the hybrid Ramcharger model hits the market. When it launches in 2026, the 1500 REV will offer the greatest towing capacity of the trucks listed here at around 14,000 pounds, a range of roughly 350 miles on a single charge, and a payload capacity of more than 2,600 pounds, which is over 100 more than the Cybertruck can manage.  Starting price:\u00a0Under $60,000 Range: 350 miles Another electric truck that might be worth waiting for is the Terra from the relaunched Scout brand. Revived by VW last year, the Scout Terra is an all-electric truck that offers 350 miles of range, a towing capacity of 10,000 pounds, and it'll be sold direct-to-consumers, so you won't have to deal with a salesperson piling on markups. What's more, the Terra will also be available with an optional range extender in the form of a gas-powered motor. The range-extender models will be capable of covering around 500 miles on a charge, but will take a hit on towing capacity, which will be around 5,000 pounds when the new trucks launch in 2027.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"ByBrendan Ahern  ByBrendan Ahern , Senior Contributor.  CLN Tencent reported Q4 financial results after the Hong Kong close that beat analyst expectations. The solid quarter was driven by \u201cAI-powered enhancements to our advertising platform, higher engagement in Video Accounts, and growth in our evergreen games,\u201d according to Founder, Chairman, and CEO Ma \u201cPony\u201d Huateng. The company emphasized AI in their press release with Ma\u2019s quote \u201cwe have reorganised our AI teams to sharpen focus on both fast product innovation and deep model research, increased our AI-related capital expenditures, and increased our R&D and marketing efforts for our AI-native products\u201d. The presentation dedicated an entire section to AI, noting the company spent $10.7 billion on AI in 2024, which has a capex of 12% of revenue, up from 2023\u2019s $3.4 billion when capex accounted for 4% of revenue. The press conference and analyst Q&A were dominated by AI talk as well. In a good sign for the company and China\u2019s economy, the company noted, \u201cAdvertising spending rose across most major categories during the quarter.\u201d Advertisers don\u2019t spend ad dollars if no one is buying! Hat tip to management for the shareholder-friendly buyback and dividend policies! Here are some highlights: Asian equities were mixed overnight on light volumes as Indonesia and Thailand outperformed, and investors waited for Wednesday\u2019s U.S. Federal Reserve announcement. Hong Kong and Mainland China bounced around the room as value stocks outperformed growth stocks in both markets. Utilities were the best-performing sector in both Hong Kong and Mainland China, up +0.92% and +1.26%, respectively, after the NDRC promoted renewable energy. Some media\/press attention to BofA\u2019s China strategist calling for a correction by comparing today\u2019s rally to the 2015 rally. I\u2019ve not read the report, but I am skeptical as I find the comparison ridiculous. The 2015 rally was driven by legal and illegal margin debt. As noted yesterday, U.S. flows into U.S.-listed China equity ETFs is less than $1 billion year-to-date despite significant outperformance versus U.S. stocks. U.S.-listed European-focused ETFs have received $5.8 billion YTD. Going back to mid-January 2024\u2019s China equity bottom, the outperformance versus U.S. stocks is very significant, but there are no flows and no love from U.S. investors The geopolitical headwind and constant negative U.S.\/Western media headlines would change with a Trump-Xi meeting. Some chatter that this could occur in June, though nothing definitive yet Corrections will occur and are healthy, though I suspect dips will be bought. Wednesday\u2019s Hong Kong dip was bought by Mainland investors with a healthy $1.52 billion of net buying of Hong Kong stocks and ETFs via Southbound Stock Connect. Alibaba and the Hong Kong Tracker ETF were significant large buys. Hong Kong internet stocks were mixed ahead of Tencent\u2019s Q4 results, with KE Holdings down -10.71% post yesterday\u2019s Q4 results. BYD gained +3.89% in Hong Kong and +3.25% in Mainland China following yesterday\u2019s 5-minute battery recharge release. The Ministry of Transport announced a subsidy for cities to trade in their gas buses for electric vehicle buses, which is in the company\u2019s sweet spot. The Financial Times has an article stating that BYD was told to tap the brakes on building a plant in Mexico due to the Chinese government\u2019s worry the technology might \u201cleak\u201d to U.S. rivals. I have one minor issue with the article. BYD has an EV bus plant in California. Maybe BYD should wait for Trump and Xi to meet and build an EV car plant in the U.S. Interesting that the Hong Kong government CEO criticized CK Hutchison (1 HK), which gained +1.22%, for selling their Panama ports to BlackRock. The company got $19 billion, and the stock ripped higher on the news, indicating they got a good deal. Worth noting that Premier Li signed a State Council decree on \u201cRegulations of the State Council on the Handling of International Intellectual Property Disputes.\u201d The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech diverged +0.12% and -1.05%, respectively, on volume down -4.92% from yesterday which is 167% of the 1-year average. 240 stocks advanced, while 231 declined. Main Board short turnover increased by +12.75% from yesterday, which is 170% of the 1-year average, as 16% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers\u2019 ETF hedging). Quality and large capitalization stocks outperformed value, growth, and small capitalization stocks. The top sectors were utilities, up +0.92%, healthcare, up +0.92%, and materials, up +0.87%, while real estate fell -0.98%, consumer discretionary fell -0.86%, and communication services fell -0.4%. The top sub-sectors were consumer services, national defense, and media, while household appliances, real estate management, and telecommunication services were the worst. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were 3x pre-stimulus levels as Mainland investors bought $1.52 billion of Hong Kong stocks and ETFs led by HK Tracker ETF and Alibaba large net buys, XPeng, Xiaomi, and Dobot small net buys, Tencent and SMIC small\/moderate net sells, and Meituan a large\/moderate net sell. Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board fell -0.10%, -0.40%, and -1.18% on volume -3.53% from yesterday, which is 123% of the 1-year average. 1,448 stocks advanced, while 3,531 declined.

Guido Mieth\/Getty Images\/Digital Vision                                       hide caption  When Christina and Jackson Agar used to get a pizza, they'd polish it off the same night. Things are different now that they're both taking an obesity drug. \"We recently ordered a pizza and we ate some of it the first night and then the next day we had maybe a little bit more,\" says Christina. \"And then we ended up throwing the pizza away because it had gone past the days that you could eat it. And it was so strange because we have never done that.\" \"No, never,\" her husband, Jackson, says. They've each lost about 20 pounds in six weeks. But the Agars, who live in Minnesota, aren't taking Eli Lilly's Zepbound; their insurance doesn't cover it. They're taking a cheaper alternative that contains the active ingredient, called tirzepatide. It's made by a compounding pharmacy, which is a special kind of pharmacy that's allowed to essentially make copies of drugs during shortages. Since starting on the compounded tirzepatide, Christina says, she has more energy for their four kids. And Jackson doesn't need his sleep apnea machine anymore. (In December, the Food and Drug Administration approved Zepbound to treat sleep apnea.) \"It is completely life-changing to take a bite of these triggering foods and just be like, enjoy it, say, 'Yup, that was good and now I'm full,'\" he says. But the compounded drugs that the Agars and others have come to rely on aren't here to stay. The FDA says compounding pharmacies have to stop making tirzepatide because the agency has declared the yearlong Zepbound shortage over. The deadline is Wednesday. The Agars are worried. Other patients are sad. Some are just angry. In Arizona, Margot Carmichael was in denial. \"I thought what I think a lot of people perhaps did: Oh, it'll be fine. These compounding and telehealth places are making millions off of this and helping so many people. There's no way this is going to stop being available,\" she says. It has been confusing for patients. Some telehealth companies have been telling them that they won't be affected. Others have been offering last-minute sales as the FDA deadline nears. \"So March 19, we are essentially done,\" says Josh Fritzler, the chief financial officer for Olympia Pharmaceuticals, which has a large compounding pharmacy in Orlando, Fla., called an outsourcing facility. Production will stop, but pharmacies can still dispense Olympia's tirzepatide until it runs out or expires. Olympia has made the medicine for more than 100,000 patients a month, Fritzler says. \"They're nervous. They're scared,\" he says. \"And we're just hopeful that we can make enough in the time being to fill patients' scripts.\" Seven large facilities, including Olympia's, are making tirzepatide, according to the FDA's latest Outsourcing Facility Product Report. They are required to follow the same safety and quality standards as brand and generic drugmakers and are inspected by the FDA. Smaller compounding pharmacies, which are regulated by states, were supposed to stop in February. Many patients told NPR they have been stocking up on compounded tirzepatide. Carmichael doesn't have health insurance right now. She says she can afford only a small stockpile. \"I don't have the money,\" she says. \"So I'm going to borrow the money and try to get three more months and stretch it out as long as I can and hope that six to nine months from now, there'll be another solution.\" Eli Lilly sells Zepbound vials at a discount for people not using insurance, but Carmichael says they're still too expensive. She would have to pay $500 or $600 for a month's supply of her dose from Eli Lilly.  For around the same price, she has been able to get three months' worth from a compounding pharmacy. The standard forms of Zepbound, which come in an auto-injector pen, can cost more than $1,000 per month without insurance. Carmichael and other patients NPR spoke with say they buy large vials and then stretch the medicine out over an extended period of time (until the vials expire) to save money.  But the Eli Lilly vials don't contain a preservative and are labeled for single-use, which the patients say complicates their cost-saving strategy. Also, to keep the company's discount, patients like Carmichael would have to renew their orders every 45 days. \"They're making it as difficult as possible for people,\" she says. The drugmaker didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, but in a February interview with NPR, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said offering a discount for patients taking the higher doses who reorder every 45 days is an \"opportunity for us to reward people who go with the program and stay on the medication.\" Some people are talking online about buying the active ingredient from China and mixing the obesity drugs in their homes. They call it the \"gray market.\" Zepbound and the compounded alternatives have to be sterile for injection, so a homemade version would be challenging to make safely. Jackson Agar, in Minnesota, says the gray market is a risk his family is just unwilling to take. \"Look, when you ban stuff, people are going to turn to crazy alternatives because we need this and we don't have that much money.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team , Contributor.  GES Stock   Guess Stock (NYSE: GES) surged 30% on March 17 following the announcement of a $13.00 per share takeover offer by WHP Global. The takeover proposal, pending review by a special committee, would allow WHP Global to purchase all outstanding shares except those owned by Guess\u2019s co-founders Paul and Maurice Marciano and CEO Carlos Alberini, who together hold approximately 43% of the company. This rapid increase provides a welcome relief for investors after recent struggles in Guess\u2019s stock performance. Notably, Guess already has a partnership with WHP Global, which acquired the Rag & Bone fashion brand in April 2024. This strategic decision has allowed Guess to broaden its presence in the luxury market by operating Rag & Bone stores and distributing the brand through upscale retail channels worldwide. Since the beginning of 2024, Guess stock has fallen by 37%, underperforming the broader S&P 500 index that increased by 14%. This underperformance is primarily attributed to weaknesses in the Americas segment, coupled with high inventory levels and markdowns that have hurt the company\u2019s profitability. Additionally, broader market volatility driven by the Trump administration\u2019s new tariff implementations and rising trade tensions has contributed to the decline. The main factors behind this decline are as follows: We will explore the details of these factors. For more information, visit our dashboard on Why Guess Stock Moved. If you prefer a less volatile investment with strong upside potential, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved over 91% returns since inception. Guess Revenues were driven by robust sales in European markets, contributing over 50% of total revenues, although these gains were partially offset by declines in North American retail segments. The recent acquisition of Rag & Bone added further revenue, supporting the company\u2019s overall top-line growth. The retailer has faced declining foot traffic in its physical stores across the Americas, especially in North America, for several years. Although this region currently contributes over 33% of the company\u2019s total revenues, management plans to reduce its share to approximately 25% in the future. To achieve this, Guess is restructuring its American retail and wholesale operations by closing underperforming stores, improving its product offerings, and strengthening its online presence with strategic marketing, celebrity endorsements, and targeted promotions. Guess\u2019s operating margin increased to 9.5% in FY 2024 from 9.2% in FY 2023, with adjusted earnings growing to $3.14 from $2.74, supported by a reduction in outstanding shares. However, the company expects a year-over-year decline in EPS for FY 2025, mainly due to higher marketing investments in international expansion and the integration of Rag & Bone. Furthermore, multiple downward revisions to guidance this year have adversely affected the stock, reducing the price-to-sales ratio from 0.4x in FY 2023 to 0.2x now, reflecting investor caution ahead of the full-year results. The decline in GES stock over the past four years has been inconsistent and nearly as volatile as the S&P 500. The stock returned 7% in 2021, -9% in 2022, 18% in 2023, and -30% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, exhibits less volatility. It has also comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. Given the current economic uncertainty regarding interest rate cuts and ongoing trade disputes, will GES stock continue to lag behind the S&P 500 over the next 12 months, or will it experience a strong rebound? From a valuation standpoint, we believe that GES has significant upside potential. Our estimation of Guess Valuation stands at $17 per share, suggesting a potential 33% gain from current levels. Currently, Guess stock is trading at $13, with a price-to-sales ratio of 0.22x, which is below its four-year average of 0.4x. Moreover, the average analyst price target of $18 for Guess indicates nearly 40% upside, suggesting further growth potential.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Business Insider Edition  The head of the nation's central bank said President Donald Trump's trade policies are set to delay further progress on bringing inflation down.          After the Federal Open Market Committee announced on Wednesday that it is holding interest rates steady for the second time this year, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told reporters during a press conference that Trump's tariff plans present significant uncertainty for the economy going forward.               When asked about the FOMC's economic projections for the rest of the year \u2014 which showed higher inflation than the previous forecast in December \u2014 Powell said that \"a good part of it is coming from tariffs.\"               \"I do think with the arrival of the tariff inflation, further progress may be delayed,\" Powell said. He added that the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections \"doesn't really show further downward progress on inflation this year, and that's really due to the tariffs coming in.\"               The latest consumer price index data found that inflation increased 2.8% year-over-year in February, inching toward the Fed's 2% inflation target.               Since taking office, Trump has proposed and implemented a range of tariff policies. He most recently put a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports into effect, and he's delayed other tariff announcements on goods from key trading partners, including Canada and Mexico.               Trump has previously acknowledged that Americans would feel \"some pain\" as a result of his trade policies but has overall maintained that his plans would benefit Americans in the long run. Powell said during his press conference that tariffs \"tend to bring growth down, they tend to bring inflation up.\"               The medianFOMC memberstill projected two interest-rate cuts for 2025, unchanged from its projections in December. Powell noted that economic uncertainty, largely caused by Trump's tariff plans, could very well change those forecasts.               Powell acknowledged the poor consumer sentiment among Americans, particularly regarding high grocery prices, saying that it \"probably has to do with turmoil at the beginning of an administration that's making big changes in policy.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

Lego's 1,508-piece Optimus Prime model can transform into a truck, which makes it one of the coolest Lego builds around. By      Steven Petite    and      Darryn Bonthuys    on March 19, 2025 at 1:52PM PDT The extremely cool Optimus Prime Lego set has been difficult to find in stock at any retailer for months, but the Autobot leader has quietly transformed his Amazon listing to in stock with Prime delivery. Considering how scarce the 1,508-piece Lego Transformers kit has been--it was sold out even before the holiday shopping season--it's somewhat surprising that Amazon is also offering a 20% discount that drops the price of Optimus Prime to $144 (was $180). Amazon's deal matches the all-time low price that we've previously seen during big sales events like Black Friday.   We wouldn't be surprised to see this 2-in-1 build--Optimus can quickly switch between mech and truck modes--sell out again soon. If Amazon sells out, it's worth noting that the Lego Store restocked Optimus Prime, too, but you'll have to pay the full $180 MSRP. Lego officially denotes Optimus Prime as \"hard to find.\" This description combined with the prolonged stock shortages could mean that the Optimus Prime kit, which debuted in 2022, is close to retirement. What sets the Optimus Prime apart from many other licensed kits of this size is that it's highly interactive. Though you won't be pulling off dynamic poses, you will be able to gently adjust the limbs of Optimus, equip him with his trademark ion blaster, and even replace his hand with his legendary Energon-Axe. Optimus has 19 points of articulation, so he's essentially a large high-end action figure that doubles as an awesome display piece.  The real magic here is that Optimus can transform into his signature truck mode, easily shifting from Autobot commander to a big rig that's ready to roll out. To get to that point is the fun part though. It took us just over three hours to piece together the 1,500-plus bricks needed to bring everyone's Cybertronian to life. Once you're done, you'll have an Optimus Prime replica that measures 13.5 inches tall in mech mode and 10.5 inches long when converted into a truck. After two years of talking to himself and converting into a truck to take long aimless drives, one of Optimus Prime's pals finally joined him in the brick-built world of Lego last summer. Lego's 950-piece Bumblebee kit has yet to receive a discount, but this comparatively smaller buildable figure is one of the coolest Lego sets under $100. It has numerous points of articulation, and you can quickly transform the Autobot from mech to car.  Bumblebee is 9.5 inches tall in mech mode and 8.5 inches long in vehicle mode.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Business Insider Edition  The Department of Justice is pursuing perpetrators of attacks against Tesla property, calling them \"nothing short of domestic terrorism,\" as more incidents were reported this week.          Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a short statement on Tuesday night that the DoJ had charged multiple suspects, including some with crimes that carry mandatory minimum sentences of five years.               \"We will continue investigations that impose severe consequences on those involved in these attacks, including those operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes,\" she said.               No details of the individuals charged were given.               The statement came as more Tesla facilities were targeted on Monday and Tuesday.               Las Vegas police said in a Tuesday briefing that at least five Teslas were destroyed after a suspect set cars on fire and fired at least three rounds on a Tesla store on Badura Avenue early Tuesday in what they called a \"targeted attack.\" The word \"resist\" was spray-painted across the storefront, police added.               Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in an X post on Tuesday night, \"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong. Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"               On Tuesday evening, FBI Kansas City\u00a0said\u00a0it was working with Kansas City Police to investigate an incident in which Tesla Cybertrucks were damaged at a Tesla deader. Two Cybertrucks caught fire, the Kansas City Star reported.               The latest incidents follow others targeting Tesla facilities over the past two months across the US, including in Massachusetts, Maryland, Colorado, and Oregon.               Tesla has also faced protests abroad from the UK activist group Led By Donkeys. It\u00a0used a Tesla to draw a slogan reading \"Don't buy a Tesla\" on a beach in Wales and\u00a0projected videos of Musk's controversial gesture at a Trump rally in late January on Tesla's factory in Berlin.               Another activist group called Everyone Hates Elon has been running paid-for advertisements on bus stops in London this month.               Following last week's spate of vandalism against Elon Musk's EV company, President Donald Trump vowed to label such attacks as domestic terrorism.               The unrest comes as Musk's DOGE cost-cutting efforts have sparked a backlash against his EV maker.               Some Tesla owners have vowed to sell their cars, some citing Musk's work directing DOGE's layoffs, his gesture at the Trump rally, and fear of being harassed.               Tech CEO Mitchell Feldman, a Tesla Model Y owner, told BI he was confronted in a parking lot while on his way to a concert in London.       Tesla stock has more than halved in about three months, while JPMorgan analysts\u00a0slashed their price target\u00a0to $135 last week.               Shares could fall even further as investors assess the impact of Chinese EV maker BYD's new rapid charging technology, Tesla sales slowing worldwide, and Musk's distraction with DOGE.               While remaining the world's richest person, Musk's net worth has fallen by $130 billion this year to $303 billion at Tuesday's close following the slide in Tesla stock.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"     Commentary: With Apple not refreshing its iPhone SE line, I feel Google had an opportunity that it squandered.    With a 6.3-inch display, the Pixel 9A is far from being a small phone. Google's Pixel 9A takes the essence of what makes the company's Pixel 9 Pro so good and wraps it up in a more affordable package. We've always loved the Pixel A series for their balance of performance and value, but I do feel this time round that Google missed a big opportunity and it all comes down to size. Apple recently launched the iPhone 16E and in so doing, essentially marked the end of its iPhone SE line -- a line that included the last truly small phone you could buy.\u00a0 The 2022 iPhone SE had a 4.7-inch display which is tiny compared to the goliath proportions of the 6.9-inch iPhone 16 Pro Max. The iPhone 16E -- arguably the SE's spiritual successor -- measures 6.1 inches. I've written already that this marks the death of small phones, and I stand by that. For years I've maintained a roundup of the best small phones you can buy and it's become increasingly difficult to fill as all phones have ballooned well over 6 inches in size.\u00a0 But many people do still want smaller handsets. Maybe it's because they have limited mobility in the fingers and using a huge display is more cumbersome. Maybe they love their skinny jeans and find a huge crotch-level bulge embarrassing. Maybe they just like using a smaller handset. I opted for the 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro, not the Pro Max and I still find its size a bit awkward to use at times. Whatever the reason, small phones have always had their place, but it's a segment of the market not being served by anyone anymore.\u00a0 It's why I was disappointed to see that Google did not offer a smaller version of its Pixel 9A. At 6.3 inches the screen is a fair bit bigger than the 6.1-inch one on the\u00a0Pixel 8A, and there's no way I'd have even called the 8A a small phone. When it comes down to actual dimensions, both the Pixel 9A and 8A are virtually identical and both likely a handful for someone wanting a tiny phone. I trust that Google has done its market research here and as a result has decided that a larger phone is the better call for its business. But still, it would have been great to see the company experiment with a Pixel 9A Mini alongside the regular version, much like mobile companies used to do back in the day (both Apple and Samsung offered 'Mini' models for multiple generations, as did companies like LG, Sony, HTC and others). A Pixel 9A Mini could have a 5.7-inch display which would offer a much neater overall package but still provide enough screen real estate to take advantage of all the AI functions Google is so obsessed with. It likely wouldn't need to compromise on the camera either, and while it probably wouldn't have space for the massive 5,100mAh battery of the Pixel 9A, the smaller display would require less power to run so your battery life would probably end up being on par anyway. But Google didn't do this, and those of us wanting smaller handsets have to just continue readjusting our threshold for what's considered 'small'. Maybe if we all collectively cross our tiny fingers on both our diminutive hands, Apple will bring back a proper iPhone SE.\u00a0","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"The Google Pixel 9a has the biggest battery in a Pixel phone to date to keep up with your busy lifestyle.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Best answer: No, the Google Pixel 9a does not support Qi2 wireless charging. It is, however, Qi-certified and supports slower wireless charging in general. But you won't be able to enjoy the faster and more convenient new Qi2 standard, based on Apple's MagSafe, if you choose to wirelessly recharge this new phone.  Why you can trust Android Central     Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.  The Google Pixel 9a is an exciting new affordable device in the line that offers enticing premium features despite its lower price tag. When it comes to power, the phone, which has a 6.3-inch Actua display, is equipped with a 5,100mAh battery, the biggest battery in a Pixel phone to date. With this, you\u2019ll get 30 or more hours of battery life per charge: that\u2019s more than a day! You can even extend this to up to 100 hours or an impressive four days using the Extreme Battery Saver mode. Along with support with Qi wireless charging at a rate of 7.5W with a compatible Qi charger, the Google Pixel 9a also supports fast wired charging, so you can be back up and running in no time when you\u2019re in the red. For the fastest wired charging, which is up to 23W, you\u2019ll need Google\u2019s 45W USB-C charger plugged directly into a wall adapter. That adapter is sold separately. Nonetheless, this is great news for those who want to leverage all the fantastic power-hungry features of the phone, including the Google Tensor G4 chip, 8GB RAM, up to 2,700 nits peak brightness, HDR support, great rear, wide, ultra-wide, and front cameras, AI tools, including photo and video editing tools, a great mobile gaming experience, and more. Google is not alone in failing to include Qi2 wireless charging in the Pixel 9a: there are few phones that truly support this new charging standard to date. With all of its other fantastic features, however, the Google Pixel 9a is likely to usurp its predecessor, the Google Pixel 8a, as the best overall cheap Android phone on the market. Qi2 wireless charging is the latest charging protocol set by the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), announced late in 2023. The open wireless charging standard is based on Apple\u2019s MagSafe technology and consists of a ring of magnets that make it easier to align your device on a wireless charging surface. The result in faster charging speeds of up to 15 watts as well as more efficient charging, overall. Note that Qi2 wireless chargers are backward compatible with Qi, so you would still be able to recharge the Google Pixel 9a on a Qi2 wireless charger or charging surface. It just wouldn\u2019t charge at the fastest speed, continuing to charge at a rate of 7.5W. Currently, there are only a handful of smartphones that support Qi2 charging, including the latest iPhones. The Samsung Galaxy S25 series phones are technically \u201cQi2 Ready,\u201d able to charge wirelessly up to 15W. But they don\u2019t have magnets inside, so you\u2019d still need a compatible case to mount them properly. The OnePlus 13 also supports magnetic charging via a case but does not support the Qi2 standard.   Affordable premium The Google Pixel 9a is the latest affordable phone in the Pixel line, offering enticing features and specs like deep Gemini AI integration, 8GB RAM, fantastic cameras, ultra-bright 6.4-inch Actua display, and G4 chip. All these features and specs require solid battery power, and you get that with this phone thanks to the fact that it has the biggest battery in a Pixel phone to date.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Our top 10 picks from this surprisingly diverse genre by  Oli Welsh If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Racing games have been central to video game culture since day one, yet this genre still sometimes flies under the radar. Many of the games play to specialized, niche audiences, yet the genre is also vastly popular \u2014 Nintendo\u2019s Mario Kart 8 is the fifth-best-selling game of all time. There\u2019s also a general perception of unchanging sameness to games about getting to the finish line first, yet there\u2019s a wide variety of racing games out there, catering to just as wide a variety of play styles. An all-ages party game like Mario Kart is obviously very different from a real-world driving sim like Gran Turismo. But there\u2019s also a huge variation within subgenres. Among arcade racers, Burnout is intense while Wreckfest is chill, and there\u2019s a world of difference between a mass-market motorsport game like F1 and a hobbyist sim platform like iRacing. If you know you like racing but you\u2019re not sure where to start \u2014 or which other corners of this gaming sphere you might want to investigate \u2014 we\u2019re here to help you find the right fit. Below, you\u2019ll find our picks of the best racing games to play right now, all available on current platforms, and some included in subscriptions like Game Pass and PlayStation Plus. Where to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X; included in EA Play and Game Pass UltimateCodemasters\u2019 long-running and mostly reliable Formula 1 games have benefitted from a surge of interest in the sport \u2014 so much so that EA bought the studio (and its official F1 license) for over $1 billion in 2021. It was a good buy. These games get the balance between authenticity and approachability just right, with handling that is both credible and manageable \u2014 no small feat considering the ludicrous speed and cornering ability of the cars. The franchise has also delivered some surprisingly strong story modes, but the real draw is the endlessly engrossing career mode, which lets you build a racing career and drag your own team up the grid, race by race, season by season. It\u2019s true sporting wish fulfillment. Where to play: Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X; included in Game Pass. Coming to PlayStation 5 on April 29Born as a spinoff to the Gran Turismo-style Forza Motorsport games, Forza Horizon has risen to become the definitive open-world racing series. Simply put, developer Playground Games gets everything right: detailed car models curated with real passion and care; atmospheric real-world locations that make for some of the best virtual tourism around; superb, smooth-running tech; handling that blends authenticity with arcade accessibility; an enormous, almost overwhelming variety of stuff to do; and an upbeat festival vibe that sometimes verges on cheesy, but mostly makes Forza Horizon one of the most joyful gaming experiences you can have. Forza Horizon 5, set in Mexico, is perhaps a little overcooked compared to some predecessors; Forza Horizon 4 is probably the series highlight, but unfortunately it\u2019s already delisted. An Xbox and PC stalwart for years, Forza Horizon\u2019s global domination will surely be secured by 5\u2019s upcoming release on PlayStation 5. Where to play: Nintendo SwitchAccept no substitutes. Mario Kart has been the definitive kart racing game since Nintendo invented the genre with Super Mario Kart over 30 years ago. (I know Crash Team Racing has its fans, but\u2026 come on.) And Mario Kart 8, which has sold an astonishing 75 million copies across Wii U and Switch versions, is the definitive modern Mario Kart. In fact, it\u2019s arguably the best game in the series since Mario Kart 64. It\u2019s a brilliant party game, of course, but also a sophisticated and rewarding racer in its own right, combining thrilling risk\/reward track design, a decent level of customization, deeply satisfying boost techniques, and capricious AI that is just the right side of maddening. It\u2019s also dazzlingly colorful and flawlessly smooth, and it boasts a furiously entertaining big-band soundtrack. Only the rather basic online racing options hold it back. Where to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5The Gran Turismo series is the original \u201cCarPG\u201d and the life\u2019s work of Kazunori Yamauchi, one of the most quixotic obsessives in the world of video game development. Yamauchi, who has also dabbled in professional GT racing himself, has devoted his professional life to the creation of a kind of digital pantheon of motoring history in games that are at once dryly nerdy and deeply romantic. GT7 \u2014 which centrally features a cafe where stock photos of old men regale you with facts about the car you\u2019re driving \u2014 is as expansive and delightfully eccentric as any game in the series\u2019 history. But it\u2019s also easier to get along with, with a relatively open structure and a great lineup of cars and tracks honoring the series\u2019 30 years in production. If you\u2019re unsure, try the recently released free taster version, My First Gran Turismo, before you buy. Where to play: Windows PCThere are few higher barriers to entry in gaming than iRacing. It requires a subscription, you can\u2019t play it without a steering wheel, and the racing is subject to strict rules of conduct as well as ratings systems for driver safety and skill. But that\u2019s because it\u2019s not really a video game; it\u2019s a virtual motorsport platform that emulates many real-world racing series, and that is used by many real-world racing drivers to train (or to fulfill their lust for competition during the offseason). iRacing might not be the most cutting-edge sim racer out there, but it has kept pace with the field, and there\u2019s no question that it\u2019s the leading racing esport. Invest the time, the money, and the practice, and you\u2019ll be rewarded with thrilling, fair competition you won\u2019t find anywhere else, even in the most humble events. Where to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X; included in PlayStation Plus Game CatalogIf you\u2019re after a truly authentic racing sim that offers a good offline experience and isn\u2019t quite so intimidating as iRacing, 2019\u2019s Assetto Corsa Competizione is still the champ. Competizione is a motorsport-focused spinoff of the upstart sim racing series from Italian studio Kunos Simulazioni, and it\u2019s got official GT World Challenge Europe licensing (i.e., cool road cars in aggressive full racing trim). Kunos boasts what might be the best, most tactile handling model around, as well as some astonishingly true-to-life laser-scanned circuits capturing every bump and camber. There are more complete and polished packages out there, but for sheer realism and feel behind the wheel, Competizione is way out in front. Where to play: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, Xbox One; included in EA Play and Game Pass UltimateThere are few older racing games on this list, partly because we\u2019re focused on the best racers to play in the here and now, and partly because so many games in the genre become unavailable once the licenses for their cars, motorsport series, or music expire. A joyous exception is 2008\u2019s Burnout Paradise, the apex of Criterion\u2019s crash-happy arcade racing series, which, thanks to its lack of licensing and this 2018 remaster, is still easy to play today. It still beggars belief how well Criterion got Burnout\u2019s nitro-fueled action and extravagant crash physics to work in this daringly free-form open-world format, even if its Paradise City location feels compact next to later examples like Forza Horizon or The Crew. A true classic. Where to play: Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X; included in Game PassWreckfest is a moderately realistic game about taking rubbish old bangers and smashing them into each other as you slither around muddy fields. A spiritual successor to the FlatOut series by original developer Bugbear Entertainment, it has a delightful and deliberate sloppiness; this is not a game about nailing the perfect apex and shaving down your lap times, it is a game about limping across the finish line with half the panels hanging off your (cheekily unlicensed) mid-1980s Jaguar XJ-S. The rough-and-ready front end only adds to the charm. In a genre that tends toward white-knuckle intensity, here\u2019s a lean-back, devil-may-care game that\u2019s just fun for the sake of it. Where to play: Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series XArt of Rally, from 2020, is part of a wave of retro indie racing games from around that time \u2014 games like Horizon Chase Turbo and Hotshot Racing that aimed to recapture the simple arcade thrills, iconic cars, and clean-lined, primary-color looks of the golden age of Sega racing cabinets. Art of Rally is a little different, in that it\u2019s imagining a style of games that never was: a chill, minimalist rally title with a zoomed-out, almost isometric camera that\u2019s all about the driver and the track. It\u2019s impeccably cool and deeply absorbing, and its toylike renditions of the Group B rally monsters of yore \u2014 cars like the Lancia Stratos and Audi Quattro \u2014 are just adorable. Where to play: Windows PC (early access)Here\u2019s an unlikely comeback. Genki\u2019s street-racing series \u2014 variously called Tokyo Xtreme Racer, Shutok\u014d Battle, Kaid\u014d Battle, Import Tuner Challenge, and many other things (there\u2019s one called Wangan Dead Heat Plus Real Arrange) \u2014 is mostly associated with the PlayStation 2, and last had a proper console release in 2006. But, amid a burst of nostalgia for 1990s and 2000s Japanese street-racing culture, it\u2019s back \u2014 and it\u2019s as if no time has passed at all, in a good way. This early-access release is a barebones but still thrilling throwback, excelling in nail-biting one-on-one races through eerily empty nighttime Tokyo streets in tuned-up Nissan Silvias and the like. It\u2019s a nostalgic trip. The best of Polygon in your inbox, every Friday. \u00a9 2025 Vox Media, LLC. All Rights Reserved","label":0}

(Angela Weiss\/AFP via Getty Images)  Victor Joecks \/ @VictorJoecks  Victor Joecks is a columnist for the Las Vegas Review-Journal. President Donald Trump\u2019s economic priority shouldn\u2019t be preventing a recession. Stock prices are always a bit of a roller coaster. Over the last month, it\u2019s mostly been a downhill ride. In mid-February, the S&P 500 hit 6,144. It\u2019s now dipped below 5,525. That\u2019s around a 10% drop, which means the market is in correction territory. This has people talking about the dreaded \u201cr-word.\u201d \u201cStocks Plunge as Recession Talk Gets Louder,\u201d a recent New York Times headline read. Fox News host Maria Bartiromo asked Trump if he expected a recession this year. \u201cI hate to predict things like that,\u201d Trump responded. \u201cThere is a period of transition because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We\u2019re bringing wealth back to America. That\u2019s a big thing, and there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.\u201d That\u2019s a different tone than he had on the campaign trail. Trump told voters that he\u2019d deliver \u201cthe best jobs, the biggest paychecks, and the brightest economic future the world has ever seen.\u201d What\u2019s going on? Start with this: Most Americans don\u2019t judge the economy based on the stock market\u2014and rightly so. From Election Day in 2020 to Election Day last November, the S&P 500 increased by more than 70%. Yet the public rightly believed that former President Joe Biden oversaw a terrible economy. A 2024 ABC News exit poll found 45% of voters said they were worse off under the Biden administration. That was a higher number than in 2008 during the Great Recession. Biden\u2019s reckless spending and prolonged COVID-19 restrictions drove inflation sky high. It wasn\u2019t just the high cost of gas and groceries that hurt Americans. For many new buyers, homeownership went from the American dream to a Neverland fantasy. Next, there is often a trade-off between short-term and long-term economic growth. Consumer spending drives much of the American economy. Firing federal workers and cutting government spending will reduce that, hurting the economy right now. But as those workers find jobs in the private sector, they\u2019ll start producing more stuff, driving long-term economic growth. Finally, the Trump administration isn\u2019t trying to blindly boost gross domestic product. That measure includes all economic activity, including what illegal immigrants generate. Trump and Vice President JD Vance want to make things more affordable for Americans. For instance, by deporting illegal aliens and securing the border, Trump may hurt aggregate economic growth. But look at how it helps Americans. \u201cIf you allow 20 million people to compete with American citizens for the cost of homes, you are going to have a large and, frankly, completely preventable spike in the demand for housing,\u201d Vance said in a recent speech. He\u2019s right. Mass deportations and closing the border will reduce housing prices by lowering demand. Shrinking the pool of low-skilled workers will also increase wages for Americans in that group. Both moves may hurt GDP. So-called experts may even declare that there\u2019s a recession. But deporting illegals will improve the personal finances of many Americans. So will Trump\u2019s moves to deregulate the energy industry, although rolling back regulations can take years. The focus on Americans is why Trump says he\u2019s pushing tariffs. He wants companies to return to the U.S. and to extract non-economic concessions from countries like Mexico and Canada. If he can use the threat of tariffs to reduce the flow of fentanyl, it\u2019d be a major achievement. But tariffs raise prices. Playing tariff chicken with Canada may hurt both sides dearly and undermine his other economic efforts. Trump\u2019s economic success doesn\u2019t hinge on the stock market. Voters want him to enact policies that lead to lower prices and better job opportunities\u2014for Americans. COPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM We publish a variety of perspectives.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Business Insider Edition  The vice chair of Canada's second-largest airline says Canadians are avoiding the US as a travel destination in favor of South American countries.          \"There's clearly been a reaction,\" WestJet's Alex Cruz told CNBC's Squawk Box Europe co-host Karen Tsolast weekwhen asked if the Trump trade war has dented Canadians' willingness to visit the US. \"What we are seeing, though, is people changing their destinations. It's no longer Phoenix or Florida. It's the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Mexico.\"               \"Canadians are seeking to continue to travel overall, it's just they may shift from the US,\" he added.               Avoidance of US goods and services above the northern border came after Trump repeatedly instated and paused a 25% tariff on Canadian products. Trump also, on many occasions, suggested that the northern neighbor become America's 51st state.               Not only are US-made goods now being boycotted in Canada and pulled off grocery store shelves, but travel by passenger cars \u2014 a common way for Canadians to reach the US \u2014 in February shed roughly half a million crossings in comparison to February 2024 and hit its lowestmonthly number since April 2022, according to data from the Customs and Border Protection.               If the downward trend continues, the US tourism industry could face serious consequences. The US Travel Association told Business Insider that while they don't have a current estimate for changes in visitation from Canada if inbound visitation from the north declined by just 10%, it could mean 2 million fewer visits, $2.1 billion in lost spending, and 14,000 job losses.               \"We're already seeing the first signs that Canadian sentiment toward the US is changing in a not-so-positive way,\" Amir Eylon, president and CEO of Longwoods International, a market research consultancy specializing in the travel tourism industry, recently told BI.               \"Anecdotally, we're seeing bookings from Canada to the US down,\" he added.               Shirley Horn, the board secretary and treasurer of the Highway 120 Chamber of Commerce near Yosemite National Park, said international visitors, including Canadians, do not seem to be choosing Yosemite this year. She said this was partly due to the uncertainty around cuts at national parks.               \"Normally, the international visitors would reserve way ahead of time, and now we're seeing the impact of tariffs,\" she said, adding, \"Canadians are making a statement.\"               Some Canadians also told BI that they would remain wary of going to the US, even if the trade war eventually goes away, over issues like the ICE deportation of immigrants and the threatsof annexation.               \"Even if the tariffs issue ends or if there's another president in four years, some Canadians are saying, 'Once bitten, twice shy,'\" Pearl Whamond, a Canadian mom who used to travel to the US often, said. \"There have been too many threats and too much back-and-forth. It feels like bullying, it feels threatening, and as a country, we're not appreciating it.\"               WestJet did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Business Insider Edition  Jensen Huang is betting companies will continue to spend billions of dollars with Nvidia. His confidence rests on two key reasons \u2014 though investors may need extra convincing.          Kickstarting Nvidia's annual GTC conference in a San Jose arena on Tuesday \u2014 a developer bash now dubbed \"the Super Bowl of AI\" \u2014 the billionaire CEO pointed to powerful new chips and Nvidia's role in the industry's shift to inference, which is when AI performs tasks, as future demand drivers.               Huang's big reveal was a new generation of Rubin chips, known as GPUs, that are expected to land next year and serve as a successor to the Blackwell and Hopper lines that have had the likes of Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and Mark Zuckerberg queuing up.               For context, an ultra version of Rubin \u2014 set for a release in the second of 2027 \u2014 would have 14 times the performance of an ultra version of Blackwell, which is expected to be released in the second half of this year.               Huang promised further advances through 2028 by teasing a line of chips named after the physicist Richard Feynman. If such trends continue, these chips are expected to blow Rubin's performance out of the water once they arrive.               That's certainly one way of keeping customers with deep pockets coming back.               But after Nvidia suffered a $600 billion market capitalization loss in a single day in January following panic over DeepSeek, Huang was ready to offer another reason for why demand would stay \u2014 and it was a simple one.               \"This is where almost the entire world got it wrong,\" Huang said during his GTC keynote, addressing the market's negative reactions to Nvidia after DeepSeek revealed a model that appeared to power its reasoning abilities in a phase called inference with fewer chips.               \"The amount of computation we need at this point as a result agentic AI, as a result of reasoning, is easily a 100 times more than we thought we needed this time last year,\" Huang added.               Huang's comment comes at a time when top AI players have increasingly shifted their focus to producing AI models that reason, such as OpenAI's o3-mini and DeepSeek's R1.               In Huang's vision of AI's future, these models require more computing power from chips, not less.               He might have to argue his case a little harder, however. Investors reacted to Huang's remarks with some concern, as Nvidia's shares dropped by over 3.4% after the keynote. A few things will have been weighing on them.               For one, concerns about DeepSeek's implications for chip demand linger. Then there's the slowing growth in Nvidia's revenue: 2024's fourth-quarter revenue of $39.3 billion was up 78% from a year prior but smaller than the 262% year-on-year growth experienced in the first quarter.               Huang's bet will, of course, now be put to the test. The extent of demand for Nvidia's next generation of chips and their place in a world of AI models that reason will soon be apparent.

There\u2019s been a clear uptick since President Donald Trump took office and empowered Musk to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency that\u2019s slashing government spending. Experts on domestic extremism say it\u2019s impossible to know yet if the spate of incidents will balloon into a long-term pattern. Advertisement Advertisement Read More: Inside Elon Musk\u2019s War on Washington In Trump\u2019s first term, his properties in New York, Washington and elsewhere became a natural place for protest. In the early days of his second term, Tesla is filling that role. \u201cTesla is an easy target,\u201d said Randy Blazak, a sociologist who studies political violence. \u201cThey\u2019re rolling down our streets. They have dealerships in our neighborhoods.\u201d Musk critics have organized dozens of peaceful demonstrations at Tesla dealerships and factories across North America and Europe. Some Tesla owners, including a U.S. senator who feuded with Musk, have vowed to sell their vehicles. But the attacks are keeping law enforcement busy. Prosecutors in Colorado charged a woman last month in connection with attacks on Tesla dealerships, including Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles and the words \u201cNazi cars\u201d spray-painted on a building. And federal agents in South Carolina last week arrested a man they say set fire to Tesla charging stations near Charleston. An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives wrote in an affidavit that authorities found writings critical of the government and DOGE in his bedroom and wallet. \u201cThe statement made mention of sending a message based on these beliefs,\u201d the agent wrote. Some of the most prominent incidents have been reported in left-leaning cities in the Pacific Northwest, like Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, where anti-Trump and anti-Musk sentiment runs high. An Oregon man faces charges after allegedly throwing several Molotov cocktails at a Tesla store in Salem, then returning another day and shooting out windows. In the Portland suburb of Tigard, more than a dozen bullets were fired at a Tesla showroom last week, damaging vehicles and windows, the second time in a week that the store was targeted. Four Cybertrucks were set on fire in a Tesla lot in Seattle earlier this month. On Friday, witnesses reported a man poured gasoline on an unoccupied Tesla Model S and started a fire on a Seattle street. In Las Vegas, several Tesla vehicles were set ablaze early Tuesday outside a Tesla service center where the word \u201cresist\u201d was also painted in red across the building\u2019s front doors. Authorities said at least one person threw Molotov cocktails\u2014crude bombs filled with gasoline or another flammable liquid\u2014and fired several rounds from a weapon into the vehicles. \u201cWas this terrorism? Was it something else? It certainly has some of the hallmarks that we might think\u2014the writing on the wall, potential political agenda, an act of violence,\u201d Spencer Evans, the special agent in charge of the Las Vegas FBI office, said at a news conference. \u201cNone of those factors are lost on us.\u201d Tesla was once the darling of the left. Helped to viability by a $465 million federal loan during the Obama Administration, the company popularized electric vehicles and proved, despite their early reputation, that they didn\u2019t have to be small, stodgy, underpowered and limited in range. More recently, though, Musk has allied himself with the right. He bought the social network Twitter, renamed it X and erased restrictions that had infuriated conservatives. He spent an estimated $250 million to boost Trump\u2019s 2024 Republican campaign, becoming by far his biggest benefactor. Musk continues to run Tesla\u2014as well as X and the rocket manufacturer SpaceX\u2014while also serving as Trump\u2019s adviser. Tesla stock doubled in value in the weeks after Trump\u2019s election but has since shed all those gains. Trump gave a boost to the company when he turned the White House driveway into an electric-vehicle showroom. He promoted the vehicles and said he would purchase an $80,000 Model S, eschewing his fierce past criticism of electric vehicles. Tesla didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Musk briefly addressed the vandalism Monday during an appearance on Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s podcast, saying \u201cat least some of it is organized and paid for\u201d by \u201cleft-wing organizations in America, funded by left-wing billionaires, essentially.\u201d \u201cThis level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\u201d Musk\u00a0wrote Tuesday\u00a0on X, sharing a video of burning Teslas in Las Vegas. \u201cTesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\u201d The progressive group Indivisible, which published a guide for supporters to organize \u201cMusk Or Us\u201d protests around the country, said in a statement that all of its guidance is publicly available and \u201cit explicitly encourages peaceful protest and condemns any acts of violence or vandalism.\u201d Some Tesla owners have resorted to cheeky bumper stickers to distance themselves from their vehicle\u2019s new stigma and perhaps deter would-be vandals. They say things like \u201cI bought this before we knew Elon was crazy\u201d or \u201cI just wanted an electric car. Sorry guys.\u201d Prices for used Cybertrucks, Tesla\u2019s most distinctive product, have dropped nearly 8% since Trump took office, according to CarGurus, which aggregates used car vehicle listings. The market as a whole remained steady over the period. The White House has thrown its weight behind Musk, the highest-profile member of Trump\u2019s Administration and a key donor to committees promoting Trump\u2019s political interests. Trump has said Tesla vandalism amounts to \u201cdomestic terror,\u201d and Trump has threatened retribution, warning that those who target the company are \u201cgoing to go through hell.\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi said she\u2019d opened an investigation \u201cto see how is this being funded, who is behind this.\u201d \u201cIf you\u2019re going to touch a Tesla, go to a dealership, do anything, you better watch out because we\u2019re coming after you,\u201d Bondi said Friday on Fox Business Network. In a statement Tuesday, she vowed to \u201ccontinue investigations that impose severe consequences,\u201d including for \u201cthose operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.\u201d Colin Clarke, a senior research fellow at the Soufan Center, said left-wing political violence tends to target property rather than people. He views the rise of neo-Nazi groups as a bigger security threat at this point. \u201cI\u2019s not the type of act that I would prioritize,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cNot right now compared to all the other threats that are out there.\u201d Theresa Ramsdell is the president of the Tesla Owners of Washington state, a club for Tesla enthusiasts, and she and her husband own three of them. \u201cHate on Elon and Trump all you want\u2014that\u2019s fine and dandy, it\u2019s your choice,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t justify ruining somebody\u2019s property, vandalizing it, destroying it, setting it on fire. There\u2019s other ways to get your voice heard that\u2019s more effective.\u201d Someone recently slapped a \u201cno Elon\u201d sticker on the tailgate of her Cybertruck, but she said she doesn\u2019t intend to stop driving her Teslas. Other club members have taken a similar view, she said. \u201cI love my car. It\u2019s the safest car,\u201d Ramsdell said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let somebody else judge me for the car I drive.\u201d \u2014Cooper reported from Phoenix. \u00a9 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Nvidia (NVDA+2.83%) unveiled more about its next artificial intelligence chips, humanoid robots, and AI supercomputers at its GPU Technology Conference on Tuesday \u2014 but some investors wanted more. The chipmaker\u2019s stock fell by more than 3% after the annual developer conference, also known as the GTC. The stock reversed course during pre-market trading on Wednesday, and was up by 2.2% at the open. Later in the morning, Nvidia\u2019s shares were up by 1.2%. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the company\u2019s Blackwell chips \u2014 which were announced at the last GTC \u2014 are now in full production after hitting snags last year. The next Blackwell Ultra NVL72 chips, which will have one-and-a-half times more memory and two times more bandwidth, will be used to accelerate building AI agents, physical AI, and reasoning models, Huang said during his keynote address. Blackwell Ultra will be available in the second half of this year. The chipmaker\u2019s next-generation Vera Rubin GPUs will be released in the second half of next year, Huang said, followed by Rubin Ultra in the second half of 2027. Rubin Ultra will be four GPUs connected together on a single chip.  The next AI chip architecture will be named Feynman, Huang said, and is slated for 2028. \u201cThe rate of innovation on all fronts continues to impress and suggests a growing moat versus peers,\u201d Jefferies (JEF+1.63%) analysts said in a note on Wednesday. \u201cHowever, the updated roadmap does suggest Rubin will only be an incremental update in 2026 with Rubin Ultra the more meaningful leap ahead in 2027.\u201d Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, shared similar sentiments in a Wednesday note saying that the Rubin launch \u201cpromises another big jump over Blackwell, but smaller than the jump Blackwell made over Hopper.\u201d However, Windsor said the chipmaker \u201cis showing no sign of slowing down meaning that it is quickly expanding into any area where AI will be relevant with the strategy to become the industry standard\u201d before its competitors can start to catch up. While this will help Nvidia keep its market dominance, having more than 85% of market share for data center chips will keep it \u201ca hostage to end demand,\u201d leading to some \u201ctough quarters when the inevitable correction comes,\u201d Windsor said. He added that there are no signs of this yet, as AI-focused companies plan to continue spending tens of billions of dollars on AI infrastructure this year. Bank of America (BAC+1.91%) analysts maintained their \u201cbuy\u201d rating for Nvidia, and said they are looking forward to Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and Rubin Ultra, which show \u201cunmatched roadmap as Rubin advances AI performance 900x (scale-up FLOPs) over Hopper (Blackwell is 68x) in TCO optimized way,\u201d in a note on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives said in a post-conference note on Tuesday that demand for Nvidia\u2019s GPUs \u201cremains extremely robust\u201d and \u201cis currently outstripping supply 15:1\u201d as enterprises wait to receive their AI chips.  \u201cIn essence, Nvidia\u2019s chips remain the new oil or gold in this world for the tech ecosystem as there is only one chip in the world fueling this AI foundation ... and it\u2019s Nvidia,\u201d Wedbush said.

Sipa USA\/Alamy Stock Photo Keep in touch with the Argonaut: Get email alerts for this weekly column by Dan Vergano As a global trade war starts over President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, and Wall Street careens madly downward, what continues to get lost is that this whole mess rests on a fallacy about what\u2019s driving the flow of illicit drugs into the U.S. In February Trump cited the \u201cextraordinary threat posed by illegal aliens and drugs, including deadly fentanyl,\u201d to justify 25 percent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada. A March tariff-tempering easing for auto parts ditched undocumented immigrants for \u201c[d]uties imposed to address the flow of illicit drugs across our borders\u201d as a rationale. It\u2019s a lousy fix\u2014both because it won\u2019t work, and because it rests on a fundamentally wrong idea about why the U.S. has an overdose epidemic now killing around 84,000 people a year, according to the most recent preliminary CDC data. While the economic pain of the tariffs and the likely resulting recession would be bad enough, they are the wrong medicine for stopping drug deaths, and might just make them worse. A worse economy will only spur more drug use, increasing the demand that draws easy-to-make, deadly fentanyl into the U.S., and kills so many people.

By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today. No argument, the U.S. has a terrible problem. In the isolation of the COVID pandemic, more than 100,000 people each year died of illicit drug overdoses from 2021 to 2023. Only in 2024 has that death rate subsided to near-prepandemic levels. And fentanyl in the illicit drug market, sourced from criminal cartels in Mexico, killed the majority of those people. (Canada is almost a nonentity in the fentanyl trade.) So pressuring Mexico to somehow stop these cartels from shipping fentanyl to the U.S. with tariffs might, at first blush, sound like a solution. But it isn\u2019t. For starters because fentanyl is straightforward to make, cooked up in garbage barrels in garages by amateur chemists, and even easier to ship. Fentanyl is so potent, perhaps 50 times stronger than heroin, that only a few milligrams rests inside each dose or counterfeit pill sold on the street. (That\u2019s one reason why fentanyl kills so many people, because a lethal dose might be only a matter of milligrams, and people using it have no idea how much they are actually taking.) The total amount of fentanyl consumed in the U.S. in 2021 was less than 10 metric tons, within a tractor-trailer load. The U.S. has seized more smuggled eggs than fentanyl at its borders since October. The cartels don\u2019t need to make much fentanyl to make selling it highly profitable. Leaving aside Trump\u2019s foreign-aid freeze stopping international anti-fentanyl policing efforts in Mexico, tariffs that hurt that nation\u2019s economy will only make selling fentanyl look more attractive as a business there. Biochemistry explains why there will always be a market. Roughly nine million people in the U.S. misuse opioids, according to federal data, either injected or in pills, with fentanyl now thoroughly flooding the illicit market. Many are physically dependent on opioids, a widespread common effect of regular use. Fail to get a fix, in this case, and you can suffer withdrawal symptoms that, untreated, often cause horrible flulike symptoms and soul-crushing despair. Tariffs or no, people will pay to avoid withdrawal. On a deeper level, the overdose crisis reflects the march toward ever more potent, more dangerous and more synthetic addictive drug use. Before fentanyl, there was heroin. Before heroin, there was morphine. Before morphine, there was opium, which the ancient Greeks saw as a narcotic as early as 800 B.C.E. In drug policy circles, the fentanyl crisis is seen as reflecting \u201cProhibition\u2019s Iron Law,\u201d where harder addictive drugs\u2014as with moonshine replacing beer in the 1920s\u2014move into an illicit market inexorably under the kind of police pressure that Mexico is now imposing. We could see a return of carfentanil, an opioid even more potent and concentrated than fentanyl, to the illicit drug market. That opioid single-handedly caused a record increase in overdose deaths in 2017, in an outbreak concentrated in just five states. There\u2019s reason for the carfentanil worry, because overdose deaths have increased on an exponential curve for decades in the U.S., long before fentanyl made the scene. The problem is bigger than fentanyl and its derivatives. There is something more deeply wrong with the U.S. that makes so many people, often ones living in poverty with mental illness or with histories of abuse, turn to illicit drug use. \u201c[W]e are frankly unwilling to fix the economic cruelty that drives and keeps people locked in dangerous drug use,\u201d as drug policy writer Zachary Siegel wrote last year in Scientific American. Demand from the U.S., rather than supply from elsewhere, whether Colombia for cocaine or Mexico for methamphetamines and illicit opioids, is the real problem. Our justice system and politicians misunderstanding this drove the \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d which tried to militarize away illicit drug use. This has been a catastrophic failure acknowledged across the political spectrum, from the United Nations to the Cato Institute. Yet many Americans remain behind bars, whether in federal or state prisons, for becoming dependent on a chemical that alters their bodies. Trump\u2019s tariff policy likewise focuses on the supply of drugs, from Mexico (and Canada, somehow), rather than the inevitable demand for them in the U.S. Our nation\u2019s long-running inequity spawns this demand. Recessions, which Trump acknowledged might be coming under the weight of tariffs, would only make this worse, as a 2017 International Journal of Drug Policy report found. Of course, illicit drugs are only a pretext for tariffs, part of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d industrial policy pursued by Trump, one which threatens economic calamity. But linking tariffs to cutting off illicit drugs is politics crafted for popularity with Trump\u2019s voters, which is why the White House cooked up the crackpot idea in the first place. It may be simpler to blame Mexico for drug overdose deaths, rather than ourselves. But it\u2019s a mistake. Instead of bombing Mexico, we should make medications and treatment beds for opioid use disorder more freely available, especially in prisons, where people are most at risk. Only one third of U.S. outpatient mental health facilities offer medications to treat opioid addiction, which is a scandal. The decline in overdose deaths that started last year under the Biden administration\u2019s treatment-friendly outlook, argues policies along those lines, and ones producing a historically good jobs market, are what our leaders should pursue. The momentum of that decline, we can only hope, will continue to lead to fewer deaths nationwide. That will be despite any tariffs. The dubious connection of them to fentanyl will only harm the very people who need our help.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"As Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE targets the Social Security Administration for cuts and reorganization, the agency is rolling out new rules for benefit recipients that could spur chaos and dysfunction at the agency. This week, the agency announced that it will no longer allow new benefit recipients to verify their identities over the phone. Instead, those participants will either have to use an online ID verification software or, if that doesn\u2019t work, make a visit to a government field office to do it in person. Similarly, returning benefit recipients who want to update their direct deposit information will either have to pass the online ID verification process or visit a government office. \u201cThe Social Security Administration (SSA) is taking proactive steps to enhance the security of its services by implementing stronger identity verification procedures,\u201d the agency said, in a press release published Tuesday. \u201cSSA will permit individuals who do not or cannot use the agency\u00e2\u0080\u0099s online \u2018My Social Security\u2019 services to start their claim for benefits on the telephone. However, the claim cannot be completed until the individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s identity is verified in person. The agency therefore recommends calling to request an in-person appointment to begin and complete the claim in one interaction.\u201d It\u2019s unclear how well the government\u2019s ID verification software works, though it\u2019s worth noting that a Federal Communications Commission report published last year found that between 14 and 24 million Americans still lack access to broadband. A similar report from the AARP found that an estimated 42 percent of older adults (some 22 million people) lack reliable access to the internet. Many elderly Americans may not be \u201cdigital natives\u201d and, even if they have internet access, may be bad at navigating websites and digital platforms. A Pew Research survey from 2021 showed that about a quarter of the U.S. population that is 65 or older (i.e., the people most likely to be on social security) report \u201cnever going online.\u201d In other words, as the Associated Press has reported, the SSA\u2019s policy shift is likely to force \u201cmillions of [social security] recipients and applicants\u201d to visit government offices to get their retirement benefits. That\u2019s really bad news because, as it happens, DOGE has also been targeting SSA field offices across the country for lease termination and closure. Currently, on DOGE\u2019s website, it says that 47 offices across the country have been or will have their leases terminated. Those offices are spread across a variety of states, including many MAGA-heavy places like Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, Georgia, Texas, and North Dakota. Problematically, DOGE has also been working to downsize the SSA\u2019s staff. Indeed, the agency\u2019s new DOGE-linked director reportedly announced plans to halve the agency\u2019s staff in the coming months. It seems reasonable to assume that such a staff reduction would functionally decapitate the government\u2019s ability to dispense benefits, especially at the field offices where recipients must now apparently show up to verify their identities. A recently unearthed memo seemed to show that the SSA\u2019s own staff are aware that the new policies being put in place under the auspices of DOGE could effectively drive down service delivery and cause the agency to slide into dysfunction. The memo notes that the policy changes will create \u201cincreased field office traffic,\u201d \u201clonger call wait times,\u201d and \u201cdelayed processing\u201d among other negative outcomes. Americans should not be surprised by the policy changes ushered in under the watchful eye of Musk\u2019s government \u201cefficiency\u201d organization.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"        Jeff Brady                        The Copper induction stove has a battery under the oven, so the appliance can plug into a regular household outlet.                                                           Jeff Brady\/NPR                                       hide caption  NEW YORK \u2014 Retired pediatrician Max Van Gilder, 79, loves to cook and calls himself an \"early adopter\" of new technology. That's put him on the leading edge of a new segment of the appliance industry focused on climate-conscious consumers. Van Gilder replaced a gas stove in his Manhattan apartment last year with an electric Copper induction stove. \"Its serial number is 72,\" Van Gilder says as he fries pork and boils water for spaghetti carbonara. Induction stoves typically need special wiring or a larger plug, adding hundreds of dollars in electrical work to the cost of the appliance itself. But Van Gilder's stove plugs into a conventional outlet. A battery under the oven charges through the night and powers the stove when he cooks. Changing from gas to more climate-friendly electric appliances often involves expensive retrofits, such as hiring an electrician or contractor and sometimes upgrading electricity service from the utility. But a growing list of companies have begun to offer appliances that make switching easier and cheaper, with designs that allow customers to plug them into a standard outlet. \"What you're seeing is the desire of consumers to start to move to all electric appliances and then manufacturers responding with products to overcome one of the key barriers to that,\" says Panama Bartholomy, executive director of the Building Decarbonization Coalition. Three products dominate this emerging market segment now \u2014 battery induction stoves, window heat pumps and plug-in heat pump water heaters. And manufacturers have plans to offer more appliances. Nearly one-third of the greenhouse gases heating the planet come from buildings \u2014 much of it from burning natural gas in appliances. That's why one key climate solution is electrification \u2014 switching from climate-warming methane, the main ingredient in natural gas, to electric appliances and heaters powered by an increasingly cleaner grid. Gas stoves have been of particular interest to climate advocates, who want to electrify buildings, and the gas utility industry, which has used tobacco industry tactics to avoid regulation.                  Max Van Gilder cooks spaghetti carbonara on his Copper stove.                                                           Jeff Brady\/NPR                                       hide caption  Van Gilder wanted to get rid of his gas stove for both climate and safety reasons. \"As I'm getting older, I was afraid that I would leave the gas on,\" he says. And he wanted an induction stove because it's more efficient, complies with New York's plan to eliminate fossil fuels from large buildings and he likes the control they offer a cook. Induction stoves heat pans with magnetism rather than flames or an electric coil. \"The only thing about an induction stove is it needs 220 volts of electricity,\" Van Gilder says. He asked his co-op apartment board if it was possible to install the wires needed, but it was too expensive. A friend told him about the Copper stove with a battery that plugs into a regular outlet. After using it for a few months, Van Gilder says he likes the stove and has discovered a few extra benefits.                  The Copper induction stove with a battery replaced Max Van Gilder's gas stove, without requiring expensive electrical upgrades.                                                           Jeff Brady\/NPR                                       hide caption  \"The kitchen doesn't heat up like it used to,\" he says. Because the stove heats the pot directly, it doesn't send heat into the room like a gas or traditional electric stove. He says the smooth cooktop is easier to clean too. The Copper stoves do have a hefty price tag, though. \"The base price is $6,000. There's a tax credit that brings it down to about $4,000,\" says Sam Calisch, Copper founder and CEO. He says that can still be a bargain for older, multifamily buildings with gas pipes that sometimes leak climate-warming methane and need to be fixed or replaced. \"In these cases, we install for less than half of what it costs just to fix the gas system and then we allow that building to retire that old, aging infrastructure and decarbonize,\" Calisch says. Heat pumps have become popular with consumers, even inspiring a sultry R&B song. They provide heating and cooling with less energy than traditional furnaces and air conditioners. But heat pumps usually require expensive modifications to a home by contractors, plumbers and electricians. Now, manufacturers are making heat pumps that plug into a standard outlet and can be installed in a window. Joe Soto, 69, is testing one in his Woodside, N.Y., apartment. \"I call ourselves the guinea pigs,\" Soto says, chuckling. He says he's happy to be a part of the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) test because he and his wife are comfortable year-round now. NYCHA used to heat Soto's home with steam radiators. \"It wasn't very reliable. There were times that we spent many winters freezing in the cold,\" he says.                  Joe Soto says the window heat pumps installed in his New York City Housing Authority apartment are more reliable than the old steam radiators.                                                           Jeff Brady\/NPR                                       hide caption  Now his two-bedroom apartment has three window heat pumps mounted in windows like a portable air conditioner, but they take up less window space. \"The beauty of this is it's also a cooling system,\" Soto says. \"The temperature has been constant \u2014 winter, [or] the summer you don't feel the difference.\" Soto's window heat pumps were made by the company Midea. Another manufacturer is Gradient, which says its $3,800 appliance is designed to be easy to install. Most of the company's customers are building owners, who can save money by avoiding expensive retrofits. \"We can install our system without any building modification, without any electricians, without holes in the wall, without asbestos mitigation, without scaffolding,\" says Vince Romanin, Gradient's founder and chief technology officer. \"It is a 30-minute install.\" Eventually, Romanin says he'd like to sell the company's window heat pumps directly to tenants. Heat pump technology is showing up in water heaters, too, including some that plug into a regular outlet and are designed to replace gas water heaters. \"We knew we wanted to go green as much as possible and cut the gas cord if we could,\" says Laura Nakamura, who replaced her gas water heater with a plug-in heat pump water heater last year in the garage of her Concord, Calif., home. \"It was all done in one day. It wasn't a major overhaul,\" and she says the new model works as well as the old gas one. \"It's just as hot. And the water is still just as wet.\" She has noticed the new water heater is louder. She measured it at 60 decibels on a smartphone application \u2014 nearly as loud as her clothes dryer. That's not a problem for her, since the water heater is in her garage. And Nakamura noticed a benefit \u2014 because a heat pump takes heat from the garage to warm water, it leaves the garage cooler, something she looks forward to in the summer. Plug-in heat pump water heaters also take longer to recover, once you've used the water in the tank. \"Because of the slower recovery, we do often recommend that those are installed in warmer states,\" says James Courtney, director of product management at water heater manufacturer Rheem. \" Really, the main thing is the incoming ground water temperature.\" Warmer water coming into a house requires less energy to make it hot. Courtney suggests talking with a plumber or contractor because there are ways to mitigate the slower recovery time. \"A solution might be that you just upsize your tank if you have the space,\" he says. If your old gas water heater held 50 gallons of 120 degrees Fahrenheit water, you could get a 65 or 80 gallon version of the new climate-friendly model and heat the water to 140 degrees. \"We have a built-in mixing valve attached to the water heater,\" Courtney says, and the water heater will \"then mix that hot water with the incoming cold water down to the 120 degrees.\" That mimics what the old gas water heater used to provide. These new water heaters cost about $2,000 more than a comparable gas one. But government incentives can reduce some of the extra cost. Nakamura navigated that sometimes-confusing process through the company Quit Carbon, which also helped her find a plumber. \"In addition to not using plastic bags at the grocery store, it's one of those things that if people have the means and it's time to upgrade to a water heater, this is something that I think people should be looking into,\" Nakamura says. She's the vice mayor in Concord and also has been active with a local clean energy group. Courtney says plug-in heat pump water heaters are still a small portion of the water heater market, but he says they're the fastest growing. And manufacturers are working on more products that are designed to easily replace gas appliances. \"I know there are manufacturers looking [at] putting batteries inside heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems,\" says Bartholomy. That would make it possible to plug an HVAC system into a regular outlet and continue to operate when the power goes out. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Former vice presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., and the world\u2019s richest man Elon Musk traded disses over Tesla stock\u2019s brutal start to 2025, as Musk\u2019s electric vehicle brand navigates challenges on Wall Street and beyond while its boss Musk allies with President Donald Trump. Tim Walz, pictured in November, celebrated Tesla stock's recent slump. During a Tuesday night speech in Wisconsin, Walz said he frequently checks how Tesla stock is doing to \u201cgive me a little boost during the day.\u201d \u201c$225 and dropping,\u201d exclaimed Walz, referring to Tesla\u2019s closing share price Tuesday, a more than 50% decline from its December peak, though Tesla shares did not in fact drop further when markets opened Wednesday, gaining more than 3% to $233. Responding to Walz\u2019s proclamation, Musk posted to his X social media platform: \u201cSometimes when I need a little boost, I look at the @JDVance portrait in the @WhiteHouse and thank the Lord \ud83d\ude4f,\u201d celebrating Trump and his Vice President JD Vance\u2019s victory over Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Walz. Walz also suggested owners of Tesla vehicles should remove the Tesla logo from their cars. Tesla stock is the leader of a down 2025 thus far for the stock market, as its 44% year-to-date slide through Tuesday made it the 500th-best-returning stock listed on the S&P 500 benchmark index. Shares of Tesla surged as much as 90% in the weeks after Trump won the election, but they now trade about 7% below what they did on Election Day. Though Tesla is joined by its big tech peers like Apple and Google as stock market laggards, Tesla\u2019s losses tie largely back to the public\u2019s increasingly polarized view of Musk, according to several analysts. Numerous Wall Street firms have downgraded their forecasts for Tesla sales this year, citing significant sales declines in regions in which Musk has been outspoken in right-wing politics, like Germany, where Tesla\u2019s February sales declined 76% year-over-year. Tesla\u2019s brand issues have \u201cgrown more acute since Mr. Musk stepped into a more divisive new role in government,\u201d JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote to clients last week, referring to Musk\u2019s position as the newly created head of the Department of Government Efficiency, the commission largely leading Trump\u2019s efforts to downsize the federal government footprint. Tesla showrooms have been the site of protests nationally, and Musk derided a Las Vegas incident in which multiple Teslas were set on fire as domestic terrorism. \u201cTesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks,\u201d Musk wrote Tuesday. \u201cI think there\u2019s something poetic about a schoolteacher being in this fight against the richest man in the world,\u201d the former high school teacher Walz told The Minnesota Star Tribune on Tuesday. Musk is worth roughly 300,000 times more than Walz, according to Forbes\u2019 calculations. Musk\u2019s world-leading $321.4 billion net worth stems mostly from his stakes in Tesla and his private aerospace titan SpaceX, and Walz\u2019s just over $1 million fortune.   One Community.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Business Insider Edition  Elon Musk has some words for Tesla vandals.          Asked about the widespread incidents against Tesla dealerships and vehicles during a Fox News appearance on Tuesday, Musk denounced them and said the vandalism had reached levels he had never seen.               He also attributed the incidents to those on the political left.               \"It's really come as quite a shock to me that there is this level of, really, hatred and violence from the left,\" Musk said.               Protests have spread across the US since Musk began his work with the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, in January. Across the pond, the slogan \"Don't buy a Tesla\" has been used as a rallying cry of sorts in places like Berlin and Wales.               The grassroots \"Tesla Takedown\" protest movement, which started on BlueSky, a competitor to Musk's X platform, has called for Tesla owners to sell their vehicles and stock in an effort to \"stop Musk now.\" A website for the effort has listed dozens of public demonstrations at Tesla showrooms in recent weeks.               \"I always thought that the left, you know, Democrats were supposed to be the party of empathy, the party of caring, and yet they're burning down cars, they're firebombing dealerships, they're firing bullets into dealerships, they're smashing up Teslas,\" Musk said.               \"Tesla is a peaceful company,\" he said. \"We've never done anything harmful.\"               Musk also suggested, without evidence, that the protests and vandalism incidents may be part of a broader conspiracy against him.               \"I mean, who's funding and who's coordinating it? Because this is crazy. I've never seen anything like this,\" Musk said.               Since January, DOGE has worked to reduce government costs and what it describes as fraudulent spending and corruption. The effort has sent representatives to multiple federal government agencies and examined federal programs such as the Social Security Administration.               Although he didn't mention a government department by name, Musk accused some people of receiving money \"fraudulently\" and suggested a possible connection to the protests against him and Tesla.               \"And they basically want to kill me because I'm stopping their fraud and they want to hurt Tesla because we're stopping the terrible waste and corruption in the government,\" he told Fox News.               \"I've never done anything harmful,\" he said.               Both President Donald Trump and the Department of Justice have recently weighed in on the vandalism against Tesla, which police say has included Tesla charging stations set on fire, gunfire damage at dealerships, and damage to Tesla vehicles.               When asked earlier this month if he was considering labeling violent attacks against Tesla dealerships as \"domestic terrorism,\" Trump indicated he would.               \"They're bad guys. They're the same guys who screw around with our schools and universities,\" Trump said. \"We're gonna catch you, and you're gonna go through hell.\"               The Department of Justice said Tuesday that it's pursuing those suspected of carrying out the ongoing vandalism, calling it \"nothing short of domestic terrorism.\"               Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.               Local police are investigating attacks in their areas in partnership with federal agencies, and arrests have been made in some cases.               In February, a Colorado woman was charged with criminal intent to commit a felony, criminal mischief, and using explosives or incendiary devices during a felony for her alleged involvement in a vandalism incident, police records say.               Meanwhile, some Tesla owners have told BI that they've decided to sell their vehicles amid the protests or have affixed bumper stickers stating \"I Bought This Before We Knew Elon Was Crazy.\"               Owners of the Cybertruck, the vehicle most closely associated with Musk, also told BI they had experienced an uptick in road rage and vandalism directed at them in recent months.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"by Calculated Risk on 3\/19\/2025 02:00:00 PM  Fed Chair Powell press conference video here or on YouTube here, starting at 2:30 PM ET.  FOMC Statement:   Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated.  The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.  In support of its goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 4-1\/4 to 4-1\/2 percent. In considering the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage\u2011backed securities. Beginning in April, the Committee will slow the pace of decline of its securities holdings by reducing the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities from $25 billion to $5 billion. The Committee will maintain the monthly redemption cap on agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at $35 billion. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.  In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.  Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Michael S. Barr; Michelle W. Bowman; Susan M. Collins; Lisa D. Cook; Austan D. Goolsbee; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; Alberto G. Musalem; and Jeffrey R. Schmid. Voting against this action was Christopher J. Waller, who supported no change for the federal funds target range but preferred to continue the current pace of decline in securities holdings. emphasis added ","label":1}
{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Google's budget phone gets faster charging speed, a Tensor G4 chip, and two new colorways.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Google has finally announced the budget phone to its Pixel 9 series\u2014 Pixel 9a arrives with all the latest AI tools you'd need to get through your day-to-day activities. Google seems to have dropped us a Pixel-sized surprise right before Google I\/O 2025 and we aren't complaining. However, there are some significant changes that the device came with this year so let's get into it. Right off the bat, you see the Pixel 9a sports an all-new look, ditching its usual \"Pixel-like\" appearance, for a sleek, flat, rear panel that houses the camera array within the phone. While the big pill-shaped camera bump seems to be all but gone, the phone has the same rounded aluminum side rails as its predecessors. For its display, the Pixel 9a gets a slightly bigger 6.3-inch pOLED screen but has a 35% brighter than the Pixel 8a at 2700 nits \u2014 and a 120 Hz adaptive refresh rate, that brings smoother navigation within the device. Google says the Pixel 9a, much like the 8a has an Actua display, meaning Google worked hard to ensure proper color accuracy, but that also means it uses PWM dimming. The screen gets its protection from Gorilla Glass 3, Full 24-bit depth just like its previous model. Getting to what lies at the heart of this budget model is Google's Tensor G4 (4nm) chipset much like this year's flagship models, that is said to power Gemini Nano and all the other AI features like Best Take, Add Me, Magic Editor and more. Talking about power, the Pixel 9a arrives with a massive 5,100mAh, which is larger than the standard Pixel 9 model(4700mAh), giving it a boost in battery life. Google claims that the device will have over 30 hours of battery life with just one charge and can run for up to 100 hours on Extreme battery saver mode. With the massive battery also comes faster charging speeds since you wouldn't want to wait around for your phone to charge. The Pixel 9a trumps its predecessor with a 23W wired charging speed and supports 7.5W Qi-certified wireless chargers.  Getting to the phone's camera system is now embedded into the back panel of the device, unlike any other Pixel phone to date. The device comes with a smaller 48MP primary lens, sticks to the 13MP ultra-wide lens from the Pixel 8a, and a 13MP selfie camera. All three lenses can capture 4K video, with 60fps for the rear cameras and 30fps for selfies. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Protecting all of these features is the IP68 dust and water resistance meaning the device can withstand submersion in water beyond 1 meter for more than 30 minutes, like most best-selling Android phones on the market. It is important to note that this resistance can wear over time, based on usage and other factors.  Lastly, coming to the software that powers it all. The phone is said to come with the latest Android 15 out-of-the-box. This will also help power all of Gemini's latest features like Gemini Live, Circle to Search, and Pixel-specific features like Call Assist, Hold For Me, Direct My Call, and more. That said, the budget Pixel 9a is on par with the rest of the Pixel 9 series, getting seven years of OS updates up until Android 22 along with security updates through to 2032. The device comes with enhanced security features like Car Crash Detection and theft protection as well. The Pixel 9a series starts at the same price point, $499, and comes in four colorways. Adding to the existing Obsidian and Porceline are two fun colorways\u2014 Peony and Iris. The device comes with two storage options like its predecessor: 128GB and 256GB storage along with 8GB of RAM. While we are yet to get the exact date for presales and in-store sales, you can be the first to get notified when the phone does drop. Google says the Pixel 9a will be available for purchase as early as April.   Battery & brightness boost The Google Pixel 9a shed its camera bar to keep a (relatively) slim profile, taking inspiration from the Pixel Watch for its cameras. But if you look past the redesign, this is the same mid-tier hardware and Tensor-backed AI tricks that you've come to expect from Google. Nandika Ravi is an Editor for Android Central.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team , Contributor.  HONG KONG, CHINA - FEBRUARY 03: Gold bars are on display during the opening ceremony of the HongKong ... [+] Gold Exchange for the Chinese New Year of the Snake on February 3, 2025 in Hong Kong, China. (Photo by Li Zhihua\/China News Service\/VCG via Getty Images) Gold prices have surged in 2025, reaching an all-time high of $3,000 per ounce, which marks an increase of 14% since the beginning of the year and 38% over the past year. Could gold prices plummet, or will the upward trend persist? We believe that while a total collapse is unlikely, a significant correction is within reach.   The dramatic rise in gold prices can be attributed to several factors. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s latest round of tariff threats against key trading partners has prompted investors to shift from equities to safe-haven assets such as gold. In addition, although the Fed has paused its rate cuts, speculation over potential future reductions has bolstered gold demand. Lower interest rates also lessen the opportunity cost of holding a non-yielding asset like gold. Furthermore, global central banks have maintained their aggressive gold buying, exceeding 1,000 tonnes in 2024 and continuing their activity in 2025. Finally, amid persistent market uncertainties\u2014fueled by recession fears and currency fluctuations\u2014more investors are turning to gold as a hedge against economic instability. Throughout history, gold has undergone several steep price corrections, frequently triggered by shifts in economic conditions, changes in interest rate policies, and variations in investor sentiment. Although fears of recession typically bolster gold prices, there are circumstances in which prices can decline. For instance, if a recession results in deflation, gold might lose value since cash becomes more prized. Likewise, if investors panic and require liquidity to cover stock market losses, they may sell gold. Additionally, if central banks raise interest rates after a recession to rein in inflation, the demand for gold often diminishes. Gold has reached an all-time high of $3,000 per ounce, fueled by trade conflicts and geopolitical uncertainties. However, if a recession triggers severe liquidity stress or a robust dollar emerges, gold might experience a short-term correction. Although a complete crash seems improbable, a significant correction remains a possibility. Invest with Trefis Market Beating Portfolios | Rules-Based Wealth","label":1}

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"The European Commission today announced the decisions of its interoperability proceedings to assist Apple in complying with its obligations under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA), but Apple has come out swinging, calling them \"bad for our products and bad for our European users.\" The DMA, which came into force last year, requires major platform holders or \"gatekeepers\" like Apple to provide third-party developers equal access to iOS and iPadOS system tools and features.  The Commission's first proceeding focused on iOS connectivity features for third-party connected devices like smartwatches, headphones, and virtual reality headsets. The decisions specify how Apple will provide effective interoperability for functionalities such as notifications, device pairing, and connectivity and data transfer functions like AirDrop and AirPlay.  The measures will grant device manufacturers and app developers improved access to iPhone features that interact with such devices (e.g. displaying notifications on smartwatches), faster data transfers (e.g. peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connections, and near-field communication) and easier device set-up (e.g. pairing). The second proceeding focused on the process Apple has set up to address interoperability requests submitted by developers and third parties for iOS and iPadOS.  Developers will benefit from a fast and fair handling of their interoperability requests. The measures will accelerate their ability to offer a wider choice to European consumers of innovative services and hardware that interoperate with iPhones and iPads. The final measures set out in the two specification decisions follow an extensive engagement with Apple and input by third parties as part of the public consultation launched in December 2024. However, according to Apple, the DMA effectively requires it to hand over intellectual property to competitors, including companies whose business model relies on copying others. This intervention, argues the company, allows officials or third parties to influence iPhone development to the point of micromanagement, making it harder to introduce new technologies in Europe. Apple also expressed its concern that some data-driven companies are exploiting the DMA to bypass EU data protection standards, and seeking unfettered access to user devices and data, including unencrypted access to user notifications and details on connected Wi-Fi networks \u2014 amongst other privacy and security risks Apple flagged in its December 2024 report, which specifically calls out Meta. To comply with the DMA, Apple launched a portal for EU developers to request additional interoperability with iOS and iPadOS. With over 250,000 APIs, the company believes it already provides third-party developers with robust tools for interoperability while protecting user data.  \"Today's decisions wrap us in red tape, slowing down Apple's ability to innovate for users in Europe and forcing us to give away our new features for free to companies who don't have to play by the same rules,\" said Apple in a statement given to MacRumors. \"It's bad for our products and for our European users. We will continue to work with the European Commission to help them understand our concerns on behalf of our users.\"  Apple said it has worked extensively with the Commission to comply with the DMA, and dedicated up to 500 engineers to the effort. The company believes it has met all requirements, and will continue engaging with regulators. But it's unconvinced the current demands will foster competition or innovation as intended.  Today's decisions mark the first time the Commission outlines concrete measures for a gatekeeper to comply with the Digital Markets Act,\" said Teresa Ribera, executive VP for clean, just and competitive transition. \"Companies operating in the EU, irrespective of their place of incorporation, must comply with EU rules, including the Digital Markets Act. With these decision, we are simply implementing the law, and providing regulatory certainty both to Apple and to developers. Effective interoperability for third-party connected devices is an important step towards opening Apple's ecosystem. This will lead to a better choice for consumers in the fast-growing market for innovative connected devices. Also, from now on, developers will enjoy more transparency as to how their interoperability requests are handled by Apple. Today moves us closer to ensuring a level playing field in Europe, thanks to the rule of law.  The DMA's specification decisions are legally binding and Apple is required to implement the specified measures. However, the Commission says the decisions \"fully respect Apple's rights of defense\" and remain subject to independent judicial scrutiny.

Kelly Barnes\/AP                                       hide caption  MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. \u2014 Calling the groups in charge of professional tennis \"a cartel,\" the players' association co-founded by Novak Djokovic filed an antitrust lawsuit against the women's and men's tours, the International Tennis Federation and the sport's integrity agency on Tuesday in federal court in New York. The suit by the Professional Tennis Players' Association says the organizations that run the sport hold \"complete control over the players' pay and working conditions\" and their setup constitutes \"textbook violations of state and federal law\" that \"immunize professional tennis from ordinary market forces and deny professional tennis players and other industry participants their right to fair competition.\" The lawsuit seeks a jury trial and wants players to gain access to more earnings, arguing that the governing bodies that oversee the four Grand Slam tournaments \u2014 Wimbledon, the U.S. Open, the French Open and the Australian Open \u2014 and other professional events \"cap the prize money tournaments award and limit players' ability to earn money off the court.\" On top of the case in U.S. District Court, the PTPA made filings with the European Commission in Brussels and the Competition Markets Authority in London. \"There is a complete and utter lack of competition that exists in professional tennis, and we believe by filing these actions, we will ultimately inject the kind of competition that will be fair to the players, to the fans and actually to the people (who) operate the system,\" said Jim Quinn, a lawyer working with the PTPA. \"It's going to require a restructuring,\" Quinn said. The WTA Tour and ATP Tour issued separate statements Tuesday saying they would \"vigorously\" defend themselves. The WTA said it has \"committed to a $400 million increase in player compensation\" in recent years and labeled the PTPA action a \"baseless legal case\" that is \"regrettable and misguided.\" The ATP touted a \"major increase in player compensation\" that created a jump of \"$70 million in the past five years,\" and called the PTPA's case \"entirely without merit.\" \"The PTPA has consistently chosen division and distraction through misinformation over progress,\" the ATP's statement said. \"Five years on from its inception in 2020, the PTPA has struggled to establish a meaningful role in tennis, making its decision to pursue legal action at this juncture unsurprising.\" The International Tennis Integrity Agency \u2014 which investigates and adjudicates doping and corruption \u2014 said it noted the PTPA's action but did not offer any direct reaction to the case itself. A spokesman said the ITF \"will take the appropriate time to consider our response.\" The PTPA was founded by 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil in August 2020, aiming to offer representation for players who are independent contractors in a largely individual sport. One of the goals made clear along the way was to become a sort of full-fledged union that negotiates collective bargaining agreements like those that exist in team sports. \"Beyond just the economics, we see ... player welfare is completely disregarded in everything, from the tour schedule to anti-competitive practices, to abusing our rights around name, image, likeness,\" Pospisil said. He is one of the players listed as a plaintiff; Djokovic is not. Players whose names are attached to the U.S. lawsuit include 2022 Wimbledon runner-up Nick Kyrgios, Sorana Cirstea, Varvara Gracheva, Reilly Opelka, Tennys Sandgren and Nicole Melichar-Martinez. PTPA executive director Ahmad Nassar said Djokovic is \"certainly very involved, very up to speed. He is still a sitting member of our executive committee at the PTPA. ... This is about much more than one player.\" The PTPA said it met with more than 250 players \u2014 women and men, and a majority of the top 20 in the WTA and ATP rankings \u2014 before going to court. \"We've seen the Grand Slams try to change some things unsuccessfully. We've seen the tours themselves try to change things unsuccessfully. We've seen outside money try to come in and change things unsuccessfully. And so we really think this is the only path forward, and we don't do this lightly, whatsoever,\" Nassar said. \"But we think it was necessary, because the players really do demand to be heard, to have their issues taken seriously, to address these structural issues that plague tennis and really choke it as an international sport, and to create a system that brings balance and equality and fairness to really the entire business of tennis.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Business Insider Edition  After Elon Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion in 2022 \u2014 after spending months trying not to buy Twitter \u2014 the world's richest man said he'd overpaid for the company.          Then Musk drove down the value of his asset even more, by scaring off advertisers and users. Some investors who'd helped Musk finance the deal eventually marked down the value of Twitter \u2014 which he's since renamed X \u2014 by nearly 70%.               But now investors are reportedly saying that Twitter\/X is worth $44 billion, after all. One of those investors may be Elon Musk himself.               So what happened? Did Musk really turn Twitter around?               That's an open debate, and part of it depends on where you stand on the political spectrum. Here are some things we know:               Those observations don't seem like a reason to boost Twitter back to the price Musk paid for it in 2022. Which, again, was considerably higher than public market investors thought Twitter was worth to begin with.               But that's a vibes-based analysis. What about about the financials?               Here, we don't have a lot to go on other than reporting from Bloomberg and the Financial Times, whose journalists have either seen or heard the pitch Twitter boosters have been making to investors in recent weeks. They report, citing people familiar with the matter, that while Twitter's revenue is still way down from where it was pre-Musk, the company had an \"adjusted\" EBITDA of $1.2 billion in 2024 \u2014 in the ballpark of what Twitter was doing pre-Musk.               That sounds pretty good! If you're an investor in an advertising-based company, you'd be concerned about all of that advertising money evaporating. But you'd be encouraged by the fact that Musk seems to be making as much on the bottom line as old Twitter. It implies a lot of upside if advertising really does come back.               Except we don't really know what that $1.2 billion \"adjusted EBITDA\" number really means. An unnamed source with knowledge of X's finances tells the FT the number is \"wildly adjusted\" but doesn't elaborate; Bloomberg said the figure includes \"a significant list of adjustments that help boost the numbers.\" Those seem like very important caveats. And without knowing what they actually are, you can't really assess how Twitter is actually doing. A Twitter rep declined to comment on the company's financials.               But we do have one more data point that helps explain why investors are willing to act as if Twitter has turned around, regardless of its P&L: Twitter owns a $6 billion stake in xAI, Musk's artificial intelligence company that relies in part on data generated by Musk's Twitter\/X. And investors are very excited about that company, because investors are excited about AI.               So if you can own part of one Elon Musk company that may or may not be on the turnaround, but it comes with part of another Elon Musk company that could be red-hot, then maybe you do it?               To be sure: A stake in a privately held AI company could be worth a lot more, one day, when the AI race shakes out. Or it could be worth much less.               Along the same lines: Over the past decade or so we've seen lots of supposedly hot private tech companies get a rude reality check when public investors get a chance to assess their prospects and decide they're worth much less than their private backers thought. And the flip side of that is that people who put money into Tesla or SpaceX years ago are very, very happy with their decision.               And as I noted last summer when Twitter appeared to be at its financial nadir, lots of the people associated with Musk's Twitter deal don't really care what happens to Twitter. They simply want to be in business with Elon Musk so they can continue to be in business with Elon Musk. And as long as that's the case, it's going to be very, very hard to understand what Twitter is truly worth.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"If you\u2019re a fan of taking to the skies in titles like Microsoft Flight Sim or\u00a0Elite Dangerous, then ditch the mouse and keyboard combo and opt for a proper set of flight sticks. Thrustmaster just announced the new Sol-R 1 and Sol-R 2 series, designed specifically with space-oriented flight in mind. The sticks are available for preorder now and launch officially on April 16, 2025. Both sticks place ergonomics front and center, with a palm rest on one side and a thumb rest on the other. Even better, the rests can swap sides to better accommodate both right- and left-handed players. There are two triggers, two hat switches, a thumbwheel, and a miniature stick for more granular control, as well as a base with 44 different buttons. Three axes of movement \u2014 X, Y, and Z, of course \u2014 provide precise controls for dogfights or just maneuvering through dodgy environments. There are also 11 different RGB zones for players who want to customize the look of their flight sticks. The Sol-R 1 flight stick works with Thrustmaster\u2019s Viper and Hornet grips, too, and the company says it will be compatible with future grips. The Sol-R 2 HOSAS combo gives an even more immersive experience with two fully-featured sticks that have a grand total of 88 different buttons. The Sol-R 1 goes for $220, while the Sol-R 2 combo setup goes for $400. It\u2019s an expensive investment, but far from the most expensive flight sticks on the market. Thrustmaster\u2019s offerings are a slightly higher-end product, especially when budget flight sticks can be had for as little as $50, but they do offer a lot of bells and whistles that help to justify the price. Using its Earth-observing satellites, NASA has collected huge amounts of highly complex data about our planet over the years to track climate change, monitor wildfires, and plenty more besides. But making sense of it all, and bringing it to the masses, is a challenging endeavor. Until now, that is. Lossless Scaling is a $7 Steam app that's flipped the idea of frame generation on its head this year. Similar to tools like Nvidia's DLSS 3 and AMD's FSR 3, Lossless Scaling offers frame generation. However, it works with any game, and with any graphics card, and it can triple or quadruple your frame rate with this frame generation. And now, the app is going further with a feature that even DLSS 3 and FSR 3 don't have. The developer posted the 2.12 beta to Steam on Wednesday, and it adds a couple of new features. The big one is a resolution scale for LSFG, the tool's own machine learning-based frame generation algorithm. This allows you to decrease the resolution of the input frames, leading to a very minor quality loss in exchange for a fairly large performance boost. The resolution of the game doesn't change at all. You're basically giving the frame generation algorithm slightly less information to work with.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"ByAmandeep Midha  ByAmandeep Midha , Forbes Councils Member.  Amandeep, Senior Software Engineer at Hybrid Greentech Energy Storage Intelligence, crafts solutions for market integration & interactions.   Rust has been steadily gaining traction in the world of systems programming, lauded for its memory safety, concurrency model and performance. But how does it fare when applied to market integration and financial settlement systems? My journey of playing with and adopting Rust for these mission-critical applications has been both challenging and rewarding. Despite some hurdles\u2014such as incomplete XML digester libraries, the need for custom decimal type serialization, and the lack of mature ecosystem support for certain key libraries\u2014the stability and robustness of Rust programs make it an invaluable tool for crafting deterministic, state-machine-driven architectures. Beyond its reliability, Rust offers an unparalleled degree of replayability and verifiable computations, ensuring that financial computations produce the same results every time they are executed. This predictability is crucial in financial systems, where regulatory compliance and auditability demand strict reproducibility. Financial settlements often rely on extensive XML-based communication protocols. While Rust provides several XML parsing libraries like roxmltree and quick-xml, they do not fully support complex digesting needs, requiring additional manual processing layers. Moreover, XML serialization and deserialization (serde-xml-rs) are not as straightforward as in other languages like Python or Java, adding extra overhead for developers. Handling deeply nested structures and mixed content requires custom implementations, making XML-heavy workflows cumbersome. Many developers coming from Python or Java expect an ElementTree-like DOM library for XML processing. However, it has no longer been maintained for Rust, forcing developers to rely on combinations of different crates and custom parsing logic to achieve similar functionality. Precision in financial transactions is paramount. Unlike other languages with built-in decimal support, Rust requires writing custom serialization\/deserialization logic for decimal types, often leveraging crates like rust_decimal to ensure accuracy, which are then custom serialized to f64 or some other String type. Although Rust\u2019s ecosystem is growing, some crucial libraries remain immature. The clickhouse crate, for example, lacks the full feature set available in Python, making direct integration with analytical workloads more cumbersome. Similarly, while polars is a promising alternative to pandas, it lacks the extensive community support and flexibility of Python\u2019s data processing stack. This often tempts developers to prototype in Python before implementing production-grade Rust solutions. For market integration and financial settlements, analytics play a crucial role in decision making. Rust lacks a robust equivalent to Python\u2019s pandas, forcing developers to rely on polars, which are still evolving. While these libraries offer performance advantages, they require a different mindset compared to the well-established Python ecosystem. Complex data-wrangling tasks that would be a single-line operation in pandas often require verbose, lower-level implementations in Rust. Rust\u2019s ownership model and strict compile-time guarantees force developers to rethink how they structure their logic. While initially daunting, this constraint turns into an advantage as it encourages disciplined programming practices. However, for teams transitioning from dynamic languages like Python or JavaScript, the learning curve can be steep. Borrowing rules, lifetimes and explicit type management introduce additional complexity. Once compiled, Rust programs exhibit a remarkable level of stability. Memory safety and the absence of data races ensure that financial transactions execute with deterministic behavior, reducing runtime errors and mitigating potential security vulnerabilities. Rust\u2019s strict type system also enables verifiable computations, meaning that the same input will always produce the same output\u2014critical for financial reconciliation and regulatory audits. Financial settlement systems operate as finite state machines, processing transactions through well-defined stages. Rust\u2019s enums, pattern matching and type safety naturally encourage this architecture, leading to code that is both maintainable and predictable. The language enforces clear transitions between states, reducing ambiguity in processing complex business logic. The absence of garbage collection means no unpredictable pauses, making Rust ideal for latency-sensitive financial applications. This is particularly crucial for market integration where milliseconds matter. The deterministic execution model of Rust ensures that transaction processing remains predictable, even under heavy loads. Rust\u2019s threading model, built around ownership and send\/sync traits, allows developers to write concurrent code without introducing data races. Concurrency in Rust is further powered by Tokio, a battle-tested async runtime that enables highly efficient event-driven programming. Rust is not just about backend processing\u2014it also offers some of the most secure and flexible web application frameworks. Axum, built on Tokio, provides an intuitive and powerful way to develop web applications while ensuring security and performance. Unlike traditional web frameworks that rely on bloated middleware layers, Axum enables lightweight and highly efficient request handling, making it an excellent choice for building secure API endpoints for financial transactions. One of Rust\u2019s most compelling advantages over languages like Java is the efficiency of its database ORM crates. SeaORM, an asynchronous ORM, drastically reduces memory consumption compared to traditional ORMs like Hibernate. While Java-based ORM layers often require gigabytes of memory, SeaORM ensures minimal memory footprint while providing powerful features like query building and database abstraction. Rust\u2019s ability to interface with WebAssembly makes it a versatile choice for integrating with existing financial infrastructure. Many legacy systems in financial institutions rely on COBOL, Java or C++, and Rust\u2019s FFI (foreign function interface) support enables gradual migration without requiring a complete overhaul. Despite its steep learning curve, Rust has proven itself as a powerful language for financial technology. The discipline results in highly reliable code, and its ecosystem continues to grow. While certain gaps in the Rust ecosystem may push developers to prototype in languages like Python, the need for deterministic, robust and high-performance solutions brings Rust back into the picture when building for production. The growing investment in Rust-based tooling, ranging from database engines to analytics frameworks, signals a promising future for the language in enterprise applications.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Search The Points Guy Lufthansa CEO Jens Ritter is emphatic about the state of the transatlantic travel market: Business is good and continues to grow. \"We don't see any impact on the booking situation right now,\" he said at an event celebrating the Frankfurt-based carrier's new Allegris first-class cabin in Munich on Wednesday. Fly a few hundred miles south to the home of Lufthansa's sibling carrier, Swiss, and the outlook is not quite so rosy. There are signs that Swiss vacationers are beginning to look to destinations other than the U.S. for their travel plans, L\u00e9a Wertheimer, the head of corporate communications at Swiss, said at the event. Corporate demand is steady, but leisure travel is down, she added. The issue at hand was whether U.S. President Donald Trump's policies, from potentially steep tariffs on European goods to diminished support for NATO, were affecting demand among Europeans for travel to the U.S. At stake is one of the largest and most lucrative long-haul international markets in the world. Since the coronavirus pandemic, demand has boomed across the North Atlantic as more Americans have sought out vacations in Europe and vice versa. That boom has buoyed profits everywhere, from airlines like Delta Air Lines to International Airlines Group, the owner of British Airways and Iberia, and the Lufthansa Group. A weakening of the transatlantic market could spell financial difficulties for legacy carriers on both sides of the pond. Already, Trump's threats of tariffs have hit the U.S.-Canada market. Canadian carriers, including Air Canada and Porter Airlines, have seen demand drop and are considering cutting flights. And United Airlines, the largest U.S. carrier in the market, is pulling back some of its transborder flights. United is pulling flights from U.S.-Canada routes as part of a plan to retire 21 aircraft early following a weaker-than-expected first quarter, CEO Scott Kirby said at an investor event March 11. We've seen a \"big drop in Canadian traffic going to the U.S.,\" he added. But at the same event where Kirby spoke of United cutting flights to Canada, he and executives from American Airlines and Delta said demand to Europe remained strong. \"We continue to see nice advance bookings for both transatlantic and transpacific,\" Ed Bastian, the CEO of Delta, said March 11. American plans to add or resume five routes to Europe, including Miami to Rome and Philadelphia to Milan, this summer. Delta is adding eight new routes, including its first-ever service to Catania in Italy. United's European plans include flights to Bilbao in Spain, Faro in Portugal and Nuuk in Greenland. United was the largest airline between the U.S. and Europe by seats in 2024, schedule data from aviation analytics firm Cirium shows. Lufthansa was fifth \u2014 second among European carriers after British Airways \u2014 and Swiss a distant 12th. The big European and U.S. airlines all operate joint ventures across the North Atlantic that allow them to coordinate schedules and fares. The pacts include Lufthansa and Swiss with United; British Airways and Iberia with American; and Air France and KLM with Delta. For now, Ritter said Lufthansa wishes it could grow more to the U.S. The airline faces growth constraints owing primarily to delivery delays at Airbus and Boeing. Certification of the carrier's new Allegris seats on the Boeing 787 has resulted in 15 completed planes parked at the plane-maker's plant in North Charleston, South Carolina, awaiting sign-off for delivery. \"We have a very, very strong connection to the U.S.,\" Ritter said, adding that it \"continues to grow.\" Related reading: Maximize your travel The Points Guy believes that credit cards can transform lives, helping you leverage everyday spending for cash back or travel experiences that might otherwise be out of reach.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Withings' ScanWatch Nova is the best-looking hybrid smartwatch I've ever used.   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  I used dozens of Wear OS smartwatches over the years, but I ultimately settled on the Apple Watch because of its hassle-free usability and feature-set. My biggest annoyance with the Apple Watch is that it's unmistakably a tech product; it doesn't look or feel like an actual watch.  In Hardwired, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, audio products, storage servers, and networking gear. This is where hybrid smartwatches come into the equation. These products look like regular watches, but they come with the usual smarts that you'd associate with a smartwatch, including health and activity tracking, workout logging, and even blood oxygen and ECG monitoring. So when Withings asked if I wanted to take a look at the ScanWatch Nova, I was interested. I knew Withings made hybrid smartwatches, but I didn't pay particular attention to its products, so I had no idea what to expect with the ScanWatch Nova. I liked the design and thought it was an intriguing product, but it's only after I started using it that I understood its true potential. Now, before we get started, you'll need to know that the ScanWatch Nova is pricier than most smartwatches in the market, and only the Apple Watch Ultra and Huawei Watch Ultimate demand a higher price. The hybrid smartwatch costs $599 on Amazon, and that's twice what you'd pay for a standard Galaxy Watch 7.  Thankfully, Withings justifies the cost by delivering what is the best-looking hybrid smartwatch around. The ScanWatch Nova has a gorgeous design, and the dive-inspired dial immediately allows it to stand out. I'm a huge fan of Citizen's products \u2014 I own a half-dozen Promaster watches \u2014 and the Nova looks like the Promaster Dive. It even gets a Super-LumiNova coating that allows the indices and hands to glow in the dark.  The Nova has a 42mm watch face, and it has a stainless steel case with polished edges, a ceramic rotating bezel, steel rotating crown, and anti-reflective strengthened glass. The watch has a metal bracelet out of the box, but Withings includes a fluoroelastomer band in the package, along with the requisite tools to adjust the links on the metal band, which is a nice touch.  On that note, the ScanWatch Nova is available in black, blue, and green dials, and I went with the green option as that looks particularly striking. The Nova still looks pristine after a month of use that included travel to three countries, and that's after my 21-month-old got a hold of the watch and decided to throw it about.  The design combined with the attention to detail makes the ScanWatch Nova one of the best-looking watches around, and the elegant design is a clear selling point. Coming in at 63g, the Nova isn't heavy that you'd notice, but it has the right amount of heft to feel like a regular watch \u2014 this is an issue with most smartwatches, which end up being too light.  At a quick glance, it isn't evident that the ScanWatch Nova is a hybrid smartwatch, and the only indicator to its smarts is the 0.63-inch dial that houses an OLED panel. It is a monochrome panel with a pixel density of 282PPI, and text looks clear without any fringing. Text is easily readable even under sunlight, and while the size of the panel means you're limited in what notifications show up on the watch, it wasn't a big problem as such. It's easy to navigate the menus via the rotating crown, and you can view heart rate info and activity data with relative ease. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Although the ScanWatch Nova is a hybrid smartwatch, it has a full suite of health monitoring sensors. You get an optical module to measure heart rate, an SpO2 sensor, a new TempTech24\/7 sensor that measures skin temperature throughout the day, and an electrocardiogram module that lets you take ECG readings on the watch itself. In this regard, the Nova is just as good as a regular smartwatch, and if anything, Withings has an edge thanks to ECG readings. The feature does a good job, and even with regular heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, the Nova held its own against the best smartwatches. There's also a cardio check-up that's bundled with the Withings+ subscription. I'm not a fan of subscriptions, and I don't quite see the point of Withings+; it has workouts and meal plans, and provides a scorecard based on your health and activity data, and while I used the trial, I didn't see enough value in paying $10 a month. Considering the cost of the Nova, Withings should have offered a free year of Withings+, but that isn't the case.  Coming to activity monitoring, the ScanWatch Nova does a good job logging steps, and it even has automatic activity detection. I tested it with my indoor bike, and while it took a little while to notice the activity, it logged it without any intervention. The data is in line with other smartwatches I tested, and while you don't get much metrics on the Nova itself, the mobile app does a great job highlighting activity data. The only issue in this area is that the Nova doesn't include a built-in GPS, so if you're running outdoors, you'll need to bring your phone along. That is an annoyance, and other than this omission, there isn't anything missing on the smartwatch. I had no issues with notifications either, and while not as customizable as a regular smartwatch, it serves the need \u2014 and that's what I want.  The biggest advantage with a hybrid smartwatch is battery life, and the ScanWatch Nova excels in this area. I got close to three weeks of battery life before having to charge the smartwatch, and not having any battery anxiety is a genuine differentiator. The Nova uses a custom charging cradle, and it takes over two hours to charge, but you'll only be doing so once a month. Ultimately, the ScanWatch Nova does everything I need in a smartwatch, but it doesn't look or feel like one, and the elegant design combined with extensive health and activity monitoring make it a great \u2014 if costly \u2014 choice. I used the watch for a month now, and in that time, I didn't feel the need to go back to the Apple Watch \u2014 which in itself is the highest praise I can give the Nova.   With a stunning design and extensive health and activity monitoring features, the ScanWatch Nova is the best hybrid smartwatch around.

Then came One UI 7 with Android 15, and we\u2019re back to waiting endlessly for Samsung to release the update or even share some concrete information about it. The company finally confirmed that One UI 7 stable is coming to older flagships from April 7. As it turns out, that\u2019s not the date you will get the update on. As spotted by Sammyguru, the One UI 7 stable update is coming to global markets on April 7, but users in the US will have to wait a bit. In its US press release, Samsung has announced that the stable update will reach the Galaxy S24 series, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and Galaxy Z Flip 6 in the region on April 10, gradually expanding to more Galaxy smartphones and tablets. Devices expected to receive One UI 7 stable soon include the above, as well as the Galaxy S24 FE, the Galaxy S23 series, the Galaxy S23 FE, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5, the Galaxy Tab S10 series, and the Galaxy Tab S9 series.

{"date":"2025-03-19","content":"Business Insider Edition  The stock market's constant reaction to policy uncertainty and tariffs has dominated the news over the past few weeks.          But using headlines to guess where markets go next is a bad idea. Once information is widely known, it's already priced into the market and probably too late to react.               A close look at data demonstrates how quickly markets can react to a headline. For example, on March 3, President Donald Trump preemptively announced that tariffs on Canada and Mexico would go into effect the following day after he delayed them. Instantly, stocks making new lows on the Nasdaq spiked.               However, the same data can be used to gauge real-time market sentiment and find clues for where markets go next. Helene Meisler, a technical analyst who sifts through data and publishes charts weekly, says signals indicate that the market is in bearish and oversold territory \u2014 a sign that we could see an oversold rally in the near term. But if we don't, then panic can set in, she added.               \"If we chop around here for a couple of days and then we rally again, maybe people get a little more excited, and they ease off a little bit on the bearishness,\" she said. \"But ultimately, I think we're going down again.\"               The bottom isn't in yet since she doesn't see panic, something she uses the International Securities Exchange put-call ratio to determine. Once there are more options to sell (puts) than to buy (calls) for numerous days, it'll suggest panic. And once we get there, Meisler will turn bullish.               In mid-December, Meisler called for a correction in the first quarter. While she couldn't gauge the depth or reason for it, she advised taking profits ahead of the event, citing that the overbought\/oversold oscillator was making lower highs, a sign that buying pressure was weakening.               \"If you asked me back then what I thought would take the market down, I'm certain my answer was that, if we knew then it's already priced in,\" Meisler said. \"So the answer is, I never know. It's always going to be something from left field.\"               Below are five charts Meisler is focusing on this week to gauge market sentiment and the stock market's near-term outlook.               The chart below shows the number of stocks making new 52-week lows traded on the Nasdaq Composite Index. It shows that over the past week, fewer stocks have made new lows, indicating that selling is drying up and bearish sentiment is slowing down. Meisler focused on the Nasdaq this week since the index saw the steepest pullback of the three major indexes.               The chart below shows overall market breadth, which tracks most stocks. It recently made a higher low, suggesting that selling pressure is subsiding.               In contrast, the lower chart for the S&P 500 shows the index continued to make a lower low, indicating a divergence as investors continued to shed off riskier, rich technology stocks. Still, it's a good sign because only a handful of stocks had been the mover of the major index.               \"So, it tells you that the index movers are pulling the index down, but for the majority of stocks, the selling has stopped,\" Meisler said.               Below is a chart that shows stocks trading on the NYSE were in overbought territory in the final quarter of 2024. As we neared 2025, overbought peaks were making lower highs, indicating that buying pressure was drying up. However, March's oversold trough remained higher than December's oversold trough, suggesting there's now less momentum on the downside, Meisler said.               While stocks remain in oversold territory, they are beginning to recover as the oscillator approaches the zero or neutral mark.               The chart below is from StockCharts.com.               Since 2024, the S&P 500's highs were accompanied by bulls at 60% based on data from the Investors Intelligence Survey, a sentiment survey for attitudes of US advisors.               \"Over 60% is typically too many bulls, Meisler said. \"I can't think of in my career, and I've been doing this since 1982, I can't think of one time we went over 70%.\"               Data from the previous week shows the bears are only at 27%.               It's up to investors to decide what side of the market they'd rather be on.               \"I have an old trader friend who always says, sometimes you want to be on the outside looking in, rather than on the inside wishing you were out,\" Meisler said. \"And to me the market has that feeling to it right now. But if we got panic, I'd be bullish.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.
