{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Business Insider Edition  The S&P 500 may have followed the Nasdaq Composite into correction territory on Thursday, but Kevin O'Leary has said the pain will be temporary \u2014 and bargain hunters should buy the dip.          President Donald Trump slapped 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports on Wednesday, sparking retaliatory tariffs from the EU and Canada. Trump promptly threatened to impose 200% tariffs on French Champagne and other alcoholic drinks from Europe.               Escalating import duties have reignited inflation fears and recession concerns. The S&P 500 closed Thursday more than 10% below its February high.               Tariffs should be viewed as \"negotiating tools of economic warfare,\" O'Leary said in a Yahoo Finance interview released on Thursday morning.               \"I'm in the camp that says Trump doesn't want to trash the market indefinitely,\" the \"Shark Tank\" star said. He said the president may be seeking to level the terms of global trade for America before next year's midterm elections.               The O'Leary Ventures chairman said that stocks were \"extremely expensive,\" but the sell-off means there are now great companies with strong growth prospects trading at compelling prices. The small-cap Russell 2000 index is \"fraught with value all over the place,\" he said.               The celebrity investor said he's plowed more of his money into index funds because they're \"on sale,\" and people are acting like it's the end of the world when the reality is much less dire.               \"Nobody likes volatility, but as an investor, you learn that you have to hold your nose, and when there's blood in the streets, you have to be buying,\" O'Leary said. \"You just have to look long-term and realize these are buying opportunities.\"               The self-proclaimed \"Mr Wonderful\" said he doesn't expect a near-term economic contraction. He pointed to the strength of consumers and the broader economy, the robust performance of his myriad private companies, and the fact he doesn't expect tariffs to stay in place for long.               \"No, no, I don't see the recession,\" O'Leary said. \"Look, I'm not saying we won't have one, but I don't see it yet.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"The Trump administration's tariffs last week set off a market slump. Consumer attitudes soured in March alongside slumping markets and growing concern about a possible recession, University of Michigan survey data on Friday showed. Sentiment worsened more than economists expected. The figure marked the third consecutive month of dampening consumer attitudes, data showed. Expectations about future economic conditions worsened in a slew of key areas, including personal finances, labor markets, inflation and stock markets, the survey said. Consumer sentiment soured among both Democrats and Republicans, though it dropped more among Democrats, data showed. On Thursday, the S&P 500 closed down more than 10% since a peak attained last month, meaning the decline officially qualified as a market correction. It marked the index's first correction since October 2023. The major stock indexes recovered some losses in early trading on Friday. Consumers expect the inflation rate to rise to 4.9% over the next year, according to the survey, which marks a significant jump in year-ahead inflation expectations compared to survey results in February. The current inflation rate stands at 2.8%, nearly a percentage point higher than the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. President Donald Trump's tariffs last week set off an escalating global trade war. The U.S. slapped 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, some of which were delayed. Trump also imposed a 10% tariff on China, doubling taxes on Chinese imports to 20%. Trump\u2019s 25% tariffs on all imported steel and aluminum products took effect on Wednesday. The array of duties on imported goods prompted retaliatory measures from China, Canada and the European Union. Tariffs of this magnitude are widely expected to increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers. Higher prices and looming economic uncertainty could scare off consumers, experts previously told ABC News. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Goldman Sachs last week hiked its odds of a recession from 15% to 20%. Moody's Analytics earlier this week pegged the probability of a recession at 35%. This is a developing story.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Business Insider Edition  Wall Street's dreams of a dealmaking rebound have been put on hold over Trump's tariff turmoil.          Investment bankers welcomed 2025 with high hopes that Trump's business-friendly, antiregulation policies would lead to a surge in fee-generating deals. Instead, many corporate boards and buyout firms are standing on the sidelines as they wait to see the impact Trump's aggressive trade policies and gutting of federal agencies could have on the economy and stock market.               How bad things are depends on who you ask. Some bankers said corporate dealmaking has merely slowed, while others described Wall Street's bread-and-butter business of M&A and IPOs in more dire terms. What's clear is that no one knows when \u2014 or whether \u2014 the clouds might lift, raising questions about everything from bonuses to layoffs to hiring.               \"A common refrain I hear amongst dozens of sponsors over the last six to eight weeks,\" said Seth Goldblum, whose firm provides deal advisory services to private equity firms, is that \"the uncertainty in and of itself is actually the worst thing.\"               \"A lot of our sponsors are just sitting on the sideline,\" he said, referring to private equity firms, which are often referred to as financial deal sponsors. The managing director for CBIZ Private Equity Services pointed to the negative impact Trump's tariffs could have on inflation and interest rates as among the issues holding firms back.               \"It's a shame. It looked like we were finally getting unstuck,\" Goldblum said, adding that the deals industry now appears \"back to being stuck.\"               Rob Stowe, an equity capital markets banker with Barclays, agreed that 2025 has proved more challenging than many in his field anticipated.               \"We are still seeing companies coming to market, and we still expect we'll see companies coming to market, but it's definitely making decisions harder, and it's adding an extra element of caution for corporates and the sponsors that are thinking about raising capital,\" said Stowe, who heads the division that handles IPOs for the bank's Americas region.               Eric Li, who covers investing banking for research firm Crisil Coalition Greenwich, said his discussions with clients suggest a more dire picture.               Dealmaking, he said, has largely \"frozen.\"               \"There aren't any deals going on,\" Li said. \"It's almost as bad as Covid,\" he added, referring to the dealmaking stoppage that followed widespread stay-at-home orders in 2020 as the deadly virus spread across the globe.               According to the consulting and advisory firm EY, Wall Street started the year strong. In January, there was a 29% year-over-year increase in mergers and acquisitions in the US, valued at more than $1 billion. The consulting firm's M&A data has yet to be released for February, however, and that is when the stock market started reacting negatively to Trump's trade policies, sending the S&P 500 down roughly 10% since a high set on February 19 and about 8% since Trump was sworn in on January 20.               On Wall Street, the big question is what it all means for the bottom line \u2014 and how it will impact pay and jobs.               At the end of 2024, investment banks were hiring aggressively as dealmaking heated up in anticipation of a Trump White House. Now, there are questions about whether the momentum will continue.               Brianne Sterling, head of the investment-banking recruiting practice at the financial services search firm Selby Jennings, said hiring hasn't reached the gangbuster levels some had hoped to see when the year started. She said some clients are still interviewing new hires even if they've indicated they'll push off the timeline for filling open roles till later in the year in hopes of improved market conditions.               Still, she feels optimistic.               \"I think we will still see hiring,\" she said. \"I just don't think it'll be as aggressive or as much volume as we initially anticipated, but we'll see how the year goes.\"               Even amid rosier expectations many banks were focused on cutting costs this year, including Goldman Sachs. As Business Insider previously reported, CEO David Solomon has tasked some staffers with finding ways to save money, including by reducing redundancies and moving workers to cheaper locations like Dallas, Texas.               The bank's vice president ranks have been targeted for cuts because their numbers have gotten bloated. The bank even moved its annual headcount-cutting exercise from fall to spring, when it is set to cut roughly 3% to 5% of its workforce, which stood at 46,500 as of the end of 2024.               Bank of America has also recently cut investment banking roles, including positions in New York, a person familiar with the cuts said. The more recent round of layoffs primarily impacted junior bankers, such as analysts and associates \u2014 though some may be reassigned to other roles within the firm, added the person. Earlier this year, the bank also cut more senior positions in a round that amounted to under 1% of the bank's workforce in global markets and global corporate and investment banking, this person added. The cuts were first reported by Reuters.               Sid Khosla, a financial services executive at EY who serves as the firm's banking and capital markets leader, told BI that such layoffs are part of what he calls \"the efficiency conversation\" among companies seeking to please shareholders \u2014 a trend that started before Trump took office. The topic has come up increasingly in talks with clients, particularly in the past three to four months, Khosla said. \"It's always the top two or three conversations. Some institutions may think it's a No. 1 conversation.\"               Whether corporate dealmaking picks back up depends on how long the turmoil lasts, bankers said.               \"I think any reasonable outlook is going to be a little clouded here for a while because there's no certainty that the conversations around tariffs and the concerns around the US economy or around interest rates are going to stop,\" said Stowe, adding: \"I also don't think there's any certainty that the current level of volatility will dissipate in the near term.\"       Reed Alexander is a correspondent at Business Insider covering Wall Street and financial services.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"In a push for profitability, iRobot is pushing out innovation. In a push for profitability, iRobot is pushing out innovation. by  Jennifer Pattison Tuohy If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. When I saw iRobot\u2019s latest robot vacuums announced this week, my first thought was, \u201cThese don\u2019t look like Roombas; they look like midrange models from Roborock, Ecovacs, and Dreame.\u201d Of course, as the original robot vacuum manufacturer, iRobot\u2019s products likely inspired the design of most of its competitors. But Roombas have always had a uniqueness that sets them apart from the crowd.  With these new models, the company is capitulating to the homogeneity of the current crop of vacuums, sacrificing many of its signature features and moving from high-end to middle-of-the-road in a quest to recapture a bigger slice of the market. Long known for its innovation in home robotics, iRobot is marketing its new line as \u201cbreakthrough new products.\u201d But the only notable innovation I\u2019ve seen so far is an onboard dust compacting bin. The rest is largely a reheat of every midrange robot vacuum on the market today.  Then, a day after launching eight new robot vacuums \u2014 the biggest product launch in its history \u2014 iRobot warned that it was in such dire financial straits that it could shut down in 12 months. Suddenly, it all became clear.  They don\u2019t look like Roombas because they aren\u2019t the Roombas I know and have recommended for years. According to iRobot\u2019s financial reports published this week, the company has completely restructured its supply chain in a bid for profitability. It\u2019s moved production to a single manufacturer, Shenzhen Picea Robotics, a Chinese-based ODM that makes vacuums for various brands, including its own, under the name 3irobotix. Essentially, iRobot is making entirely new Roombas. But this shift isn\u2019t about innovation \u2014 it\u2019s about cost cutting and survival. iRobot CEO Gary Cohen says the new products will boost profits compared to its legacy products. But, in the process, they risk sacrificing the uniqueness that sets Roombas apart.  Once a market leader, iRobot has struggled amid fierce competition and a failed $1.7 billion Amazon acquisition. Last year, regulators decided that an iRobot with Amazon\u2019s power behind it could become the 800-pound gorilla in the room and scuppered the deal. This left the company without its visionary CEO and cofounder Colin Angle, forced to lay off more than half its staff, and with a mountain of debt.  This shift isn\u2019t about innovation \u2014 it\u2019s about cost cutting and survival. In response, and essentially to survive, the company is producing products that look like every other bot on the block and has adopted several new features found on those models. These include lidar navigation, spinning mop pads, and white robots. (I can understand the first two, but don\u2019t buy a white robot vacuum unless you really enjoy cleaning your robot vacuum.) Consumers have been asking for these features for years, and a lack of them may have driven many to opt for one of its competitors over a Roomba \u2014 the company saw a 44 percent decline in revenue last quarter compared to the same time the previous year. But in the process, and based on these newest bots, it looks like it\u2019s abandoned much of what makes it unique \u2014 its excellent dual rubber roller brushes, well-developed and reliable vSLAM navigation, impressive retractable mop system, and stylish auto-empty docks. I asked iRobot for a comment on why the new Roombas so closely resemble the Chinese competition. It pointed out that iRobot set the design standard for consumer robots, so, in fact, it\u2019s the competition that\u2019s been copying it. \u201cOther robot vacuums and mopping solutions across the industry have similar design features to Roomba because the other manufacturers have yet to develop a new, transformative form factor,\u201d Insun Hong, industrial design director at iRobot since 2021, said in an email. While that may have been true five years ago, most of Roomba\u2019s new features existed on the competition before they came to Roombas. Adding lidar and spinning mopping pads to Roombas may well make them more popular, cost iRobot less, and make for excellent robotic vacuums (something we won\u2019t know until we can test them). But I\u2019m skeptical.  How often has a company completely retooled its products to be significantly cheaper to develop and ended up with something much better? But that appears to be what iRobot is trying to do here. The company\u2019s annual report says its operational restructuring plan is \u201cdesigned to more closely align our cost structure with near-term revenue expectations with the goal of improved profitability. Leveraging a new asset-light model, we began to streamline our supply chain to set us up for speed and scale while relying on our partners and contract manufacturers to provide non-core engineering functions.\u201d The company says it plans to \u201ccontinue to invest in software intelligence, higher-value robotics, computer vision, [and] machine learning.\u201d But that\u2019s going to be tough to do with a vastly reduced workforce, a slashed R&D budget, and the offshoring of some engineering to \u201clower-cost regions.\u201d iRobot didn\u2019t fail to innovate, but it moved too slowly and was overtaken Software is one area in which iRobot has remained dominant. Its app has traditionally been clear, easy to use, and more reliable than its competitors. Its AI-powered obstacle detection is a leader in the industry, and it has developed several other machine learning technologies that make its robots better cleaners, such as Dirt Detect, which recognizes dirty areas and focuses more time on them.  Hopefully, software will remain iRobot\u2019s strong suit and be a way to differentiate. It\u2019s already added AI detection to one of its new models, which helps the robot avoid pet waste catastrophes and prevent it from aborting its mission because you left a sock in the living room. Along with the new products, the company announced a new app. However, the new Roomba Home app will only work with its latest models; everyone else will continue to use the iRobot app. It\u2019s a worrying sign the company is leaving its legacy products behind. (In terms of development, iRobot told me it has no plans to stop supporting any of its existing products.) While this all may well be the right move for the company considering its current financial state, I\u2019m sad to see this shift away from what has made Roomba \u201cRoomba.\u201d This is the company that essentially invented the robot vacuum more than 20 years ago \u2014 and invented the modern self-emptying bin, the floor mopping robot, and the idea of a robot vacuum having a \u201cbrain.\u201d  There\u2019s no doubt iRobot made missteps over the years. It should have jumped on the two-in-one trend sooner. It took too long to develop a multifunction dock, and while an engineering marvel, its retractable mop solution doesn\u2019t actually mop your floors very efficiently. (But spinning mopping pads are also last year\u2019s thing; the new innovation is retractable roller mops.)  I\u2019m positive there are prototypes in iRobot\u2019s HQ with arms and legs to climb all over your house. I don\u2019t agree that iRobot should have switched to lidar sooner \u2014 its vSLAM navigation may be slower, but it\u2019s more reliable. And I don\u2019t think it failed to innovate. I\u2019m positive there are prototypes in iRobot\u2019s HQ in Bedford, Massachusetts, with retractable roller mops, more advanced camera-based navigation, and arms and legs to climb all over your house. But the company did move too slowly. It was overtaken on one side by Chinese companies like Roborock, Dreame, and Ecovacs and their nonstop innovations and on the other side by commodity no-name bots you can buy on Amazon for under $200. There was a moment a year or so ago when iRobot could have positioned itself as the high-end leader in smart home robotics house cleaners. It\u2019s exciting to think where its innovation could have gone, with the power of Amazon behind it. But losing that deal and its visionary leadership left it adrift, and now it\u2019s bouncing between its past and its future, trying to find where it fits today.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Business Insider Edition  A new generation of AI models is squeezing more power out of fewer chips. Whether they spark another DeepSeek-scale panic for Nvidia is another matter.          Google led the charge this week with a collection of smaller models \u2014 Gemma 3 \u2014 that appear to pack a serious punch with a standout feat: they run smoothly with just a single Nvidia chip, known as a GPU.               Unveiling the models Wednesday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted their efficiency in an X post, writing that \"you'd need at least 10x the compute to get similar performance from other models.\"       Cohere, a Toronto-headquartered startup led by former Googler Aidan Gomez, also released a new model on Thursday called\u00a0Command A,\u00a0which is described as a \"state-of-the-art\" model that runs on just two GPUs. (Business Insider, alongside other publishers, has sued Cohere over copyright infringement.)               One of the key lessons DeepSeek imparted to the world when it released an AI model in January was the ability to do more with less. The Chinese startup said its R1 model was competitive with OpenAI's o1 model while claiming it needed fewer chips.               The claim triggered the biggest single-day wipeout in US stock market history, in which Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in value. The market wondered if more efficient AI would reduce demand for Nvidia chips \u2014 demand that helped it achieve a record full-year revenue in 2024 of $130.5 billion.               At first glance, this new wave of AI models seems to pose an even greater threat, as they claim to be state-of-the-art while only needing a handful of GPUs to run.               A chart of Gemma's performance on the industry leaderboard Chatbot Arena, for instance \u2014 shared by Pichai \u2014 showed the model outperformed those from DeepSeek, OpenAI, and Meta while being run on fewer GPUs.                  Gemma 3 is here! Our new open models are incredibly efficient - the largest 27B model runs on just one H100 GPU. You'd need at least 10x the compute to get similar performance from other models  pic.twitter.com\/4FKujOROQ4           \u2014 Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) March 12, 2025           But just because more companies are learning to squeeze more performance from their AI with fewer chips, it's not a given that these more efficient models will go on to pose a DeepSeek-style risk to Nvidia.               For one, as the DeepSeek saga unfolded, tech CEOs were quick to note a phenomenon known as Jevons Paradox. The economic principle suggests that as technology becomes more efficient, consumption of that technology will increase \u2014 not decrease.               It might help explain why Google itself has said it plans to increase its  AI-related capital expenditure this year to $75 billion, which typically includes the GPUs housed in the data centers critical for AI.               Google has been one of the main buyers of the latest generation of Nvidia GPUs \u2014 the Blackwell chips introduced last year \u2014 so it's plausible to expect them to be among those ready to spend on the new GPU Nvidia is expected to unveil at its GTC event next week.               So far, the market does not appear to be worried by the latest chip efficiency developments \u2014 Nvidia's share price is up about 6% since Tuesday.                There is a small caveat to this.               While Google's new Gemma models can use a single Nvidia GPU to run on, it appears the training of the new models took place with Google's own chips, known as tensor processing units, or TPUs.               Tech giants like Google have spent years working on their own silicon as a means of reducing their dependence on Nvidia, so Gemma poses a curious situation in which Google has produced a competitive AI model without using any Nvidia GPUs for training.               Still, it's unlikely that a company like Google will reduce its dependence on Nvidia GPUs in a significant way anytime soon \u2014 and for a simple reason.               The company's push to produce more efficient models is happening alongside its development of more powerful, large-scale Gemini AI models that aim to push the boundaries of intelligence. These models' success, for now, depends on getting access to as much compute as possible.               This approach was recently validated by the release of Grok 3, the latest frontier AI model from Elon Musk's startup. Its release came with a note that said a future version of the model would be trained on a larger, 200,000 GPU cluster.               The future of AI development, then, looks like one in which two different paths emerge in tandem: one in which smaller, more efficient models emerge that run on fewer GPUs, and another in which large-scale models continue to have as many GPUs thrown at them as possible.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED Who needs vaccines and Vanicream, when you have raw milk and beef tallow? That\u2019s what the internet thinks, anyway. TikTok (or TallowTok) is currently slathered with devotees hailing beef tallow (yes, the rendered fat from a cow) as a miracle moisturizer. As of March 2025, there have been more than 68.5 million posts on tallow. Brands cash in, while influencers flaunt before-and-after transformations, render tallow from suet, or smear beef lard on their skin, thinking it\u2019s tallow (it\u2019s not). The backlash against industrialized beauty mirrors anxieties about ultra-processed food. The same people avoiding seed oils in their diets are now seeking beef-fat balms for their faces\u2014it\u2019s not a coincidence that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is selling \u201cMaking Frying Oil Tallow Again\u201d merch. But in a rush to eliminate toxins and stick it to big corporations, you may have overlooked other risks. I bought some on the internet and smeared it on myself to figure it out. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Cow fat as face cream is not as far out as you might think. For centuries, terrestrial animal fats\u2014beef tallow, lard, and lanolin\u2014were staples in skin care. The Babylonians used ash and rendered fat to craft soap. Over time, tallow found its way into early-candle-making and medicinal remedies. Nineteenth-century ointments relied on them to treat everything from burns and chapped skin to wounds and ingrown nails. Traditional soap was a mix of tallow and coconut oil, and early lipsticks blended animal fat and beeswax. Some tattoo artists will still recommend beef tallow soaps to better preserve ink. By the 1990s, advances in cosmetic chemistry favored plant-based and synthetic alternatives that offered greater stability and consistency. Safety concerns surrounding bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease) also prompted companies to distance themselves from animal-derived ingredients. Though byproducts like collagen, hyaluronic acid, and keratin evolved with modern skin care, tallow was (mostly) left behind. But now, beef tallow is back. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. This revival is part of a cultural obsession with ancestral living. It\u2019s the same impulse driving the popularity of the carnivore diet, bone broth, and unpasteurized milk. Grand View Research reports that the U.S. tallow market brought in $627.9 million in 2023 and is projected to surpass $1 billion by 2030. At its core is the rejection of modernity, the belief that industrialization has corrupted nature and that the past held purer solutions. The beauty industry, with its preservatives, emulsifiers, and laboratory formulations, has become the enemy. Tallow, by contrast, is framed as a return to the untainted. Beef tallow is rich in triglycerides and also contains essential vitamins A, D, K, E, and B12. Some studies suggest that tallow can increase fatty acid concentration in the skin, making it a moisturizing agent. However, comparative studies have found that alternatives like pumpkin seed oil and linoleic acid offer superior hydration. While some might tout its \u201cnatural\u201d benefits, that word is more marketing than fact. Retailers like Sephora, Ulta Beauty, and Whole Foods have their own \u201cclean\u201d beauty standards, each with different ingredient bans. The FDA doesn\u2019t approve cosmetics before they hit the market, meaning labels like \u201cclean\u201d and \u201ctoxin-free\u201d are pretty much meaningless. Photograph: Amazon Photograph: Amazon I\u2019m not scared of beef tallow. I\u2019ve willingly slathered snail mucin on my skin (and I still do). But I did take a few steps after ordering a jar of this ancient beauty remedy via Amazon Prime. (Side note: This product is no longer available on Amazon or the company\u2019s site, which is concerning.) For example, I decided to use it only at night, reasoning that the last thing I needed was to smell like meat sweats during my morning workout. My immediate reaction was yuck. It looked like curdled cheese but, surprisingly, didn\u2019t smell like much. I applied it quickly and went straight to bed before I could dwell on the fact that I had basted myself. To my surprise, I woke each morning to skin that felt soft and hydrated. My seasonal seborrheic dermatitis didn\u2019t flare up as much, but I also broke out more than usual. Nothing really bad happened to me in the week that I tried it (except that I grossed out my partner and myself), but I may have gotten lucky. There have been a few recalls on commercially produced tallow, and DIY tallow skin care, in particular, raises red flags. Rendering animal fat requires careful heating and purification to remove impurities. Without proper sterilization, bacterial contamination is a serious concern. Plus, tallow\u2019s composition varies depending on the animal\u2019s diet and processing method, making it almost impossible to predict how an individual\u2019s skin will react. More research is needed to understand how different skin types respond to tallow, as existing studies use varied methodologies and reference points. While tallow does have moisturizing properties, its occlusive nature isn\u2019t ideal for all skin types, especially oily or acne-prone individuals. Animal fats are rich in saturated fatty acids, which can be comedogenic and exacerbate breakouts for certain skin types. Tallow can also trigger dermatitis or allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. In the end, beef tallow\u2019s resurgence isn\u2019t really about skin care\u2014it\u2019s about trust, control, and the desire to strip away the complexities of consumerism. It\u2019s easy to romanticize the past when you don\u2019t have to live in it. But just because something is natural doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s better. After all, we don\u2019t put lead in makeup anymore. If you\u2019re still tempted to smear cow fat on your face, consult a dermatologist before overhauling your skin care routine.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Let's break it down.   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  The reveal of the Google Pixel 9a appears to be just days away (if you believe the latest rumors), but retailers are already prepping for the occasion by dropping some of the best Pixel 9 deals this side of Black Friday.\u00a0 Two of our favorite wireless carriers, Mint Mobile and Visible, are dropping 50% off the popular flagship when you bundle your purchase with one year of wireless, but which deal is best? Well, the answer isn't exactly simple, so let's break it down.\u00a0 Google Pixel 9 128GB: $799 $399 and $180 off one year of Unlimited at Mint Mobile Buy the Google Pixel 9 from Mint Mobile alongside one year of the Unlimited plan and you'll get 50% off the phone AND the wireless. That means you're paying only $579 for a great new phone and 12 months of T-Mobile-powered wireless. \u2705Recommended if: you live in an area with great T-Mobile coverage; you're shopping on a budget; you don't need international coverage or any special perks.  \u274cSkip this deal if: you're a heavy data user; you need a carrier that provides international coverage. Google Pixel 9 128GB: $799 $399 with code SWEETDEAL and one year of Visible Plus at Visible Buy the Google Pixel 9 and join Visible with one year of the Visible Plus plan and you'll get 50% off the phone when you use the code SWEETDEAL at checkout. Priced at $395 for one year, the Visible Plus plan is a bit more expensive than Mint Mobile's offer, but you get premium perks like 5G Ultra Wideband from Verizon, unlimited talk and text to dozens of countries worldwide, and 720p HD streaming. There's a reason we called Visible Plus the best unlimited data plan in the biz.  \u2705Recommended if: you need a premium wireless experience at an MVNO price; you need lots of data and international perks. \u274cSkip this deal if: you're shopping on a budget and you just need an effective, no-frills wireless solution.  I'll start by saying that both of these deals are pretty remarkable. Mint Mobile's offers are noteworthy due to the sheer amount of cash you can save by paying for a year of the Unlimited plan in advance.\u00a0 You're looking at one of the best Android phones on the market AND 12 months of wireless for significantly less than it would cost to buy the phone unlocked from Best Buy or Amazon. Mint Mobile's Unlimited plan is no slouch either: for what amounts to $15 per month, you're getting unlimited talk, text, and data on T-Mobile's vast network, plus a mobile hotspot, Wi-Fi calling, and free calls to Mexico and Canada.\u00a0 That being said, if you don't mind paying a little more for a premium wireless experience, Visible might be the better option here. Priced at $395 for a year (about $33 per month) the Visible Plus plan gives you unlimited talk, text, and data on Verizon's legendary 5G Ultra Wideband network, plus HD streaming, 50GB of premium data every month, and a bounty of international benefits that you'd usually expect to get from a Big Three carrier. Just be sure to use that code SWEETDEAL during checkout if you want the 50% discount on the Google Pixel 9. Needless to say, if you simply can't choose between the two carriers, check out our Visible vs. Mint Mobile guide for a more comprehensive look.\u00a0  Looking at pure dollars and cents, buying the Google Pixel 9 and one year of wireless from Visible will set you back $794, while Mint Mobile's identical bundle will cost around $579, making Mint the more cost-effective choice. Is it worth it to pay that extra $215 to get 5G Ultra Wideband, international benefits, and more? It's totally up to you, but I'd argue that you're getting a great deal either way.\u00a0 On a final and perhaps less-important note, it might be worth mentioning that Visible still has the Google Pixel 9 in its Obsidian, Wintergreen, and Peony color variants, while Mint Mobile only has Obsidian in stock. No matter which carrier deal you choose, you'll be getting an excellent AI-boosted smartphone with a gorgeous 120Hz AMOLED display, outstanding camera tech, and seven years of OS\/security updates guaranteed.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Business Insider Edition  Tesla has ramped up its autonomous testing capabilities in California.          In December, the electric-car maker registered 224 in-house test drivers and 104 vehicles in the state for an autonomous testing permit, according to public records viewed by Business Insider.               It's an uptick from 2022, the last time Tesla filed for the permit. That year, it registered 59 drivers and 14 vehicles.               The surge in test drivers comes as the clock ticks for the company to fulfill Elon Musk's promise of bringing a Robotaxi to market within the year. Tesla's stock has continued to drop, and is down more than 40% year-to-date over lackluster sales numbers and Musk's polarizing role in the US government, after hitting an all-time high after Donald Trump's election victory.               The permit, first granted in 2015, allows the carmaker to conduct what's known as level 3 testing, which lets the autonomous driving software assume a greater degree of control over the vehicle. It still requires a licensed driver to monitor the vehicle and take over when needed, but testing it is one of the first steps Tesla must take to roll out its self-driving technology in the state.               Obtaining the permit doesn't necessarily mean Tesla will use it. Companies are required to report usage \u2014 measured by mileage and the number of times human test drivers take control of the vehicles \u2014 every year.               Tesla hasn't reported using the permit since 2019. The company has long maintained that it conducts level 2 testing, focused on unreleased versions of the driver-assist software already available in customers' cars.               Tesla submitted paperwork for the registrations to the California Department of Motor Vehicles in December. The registrations, which cost about $8,700 in total, are in effect for 2025 and 2026. The permit can be renewed every two years.               In November, after some test drivers told Business Insider they pushed Tesla's self-driving software to its limit, the California DMV asked Tesla whether its testing aligned with what the state permit allows, public records show.               In an emailed response to the DMV, Tesla's director of field reliability said the company was testing driver-assist software similar to what Tesla customers already have in their vehicles. Test drivers underwent \"rigorous\" training, per the email, including when to intervene in \"unsafe\" situations and when to avoid taking over during \"safe but undesired vehicle behaviors\" like missing a turn or frequently changing lanes.               A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment for this story.               Musk has said the carmaker plans to roll out robotaxis in some California cities by the end of the year. Bloomberg reported in February that the company had filed for a permit with the California Public Utilities Commission, which would allow the carmaker to operate an autonomous ride-hailing service.               The Tesla CEO has repeatedly emphasized that much of Tesla's value revolves around its self-driving technology. Tesla's stock has plummeted in recent weeks, and JP Morgan analysts said in a note to investors on Wednesday that the company had lost so much value since Musk took on his advisory role in government that they couldn't find another comparable drop in automotive history.               Even Tesla bull Dan Ives sounded an alarm: The analyst wrote on Tuesday that Tesla and Musk are facing a \"moment of truth\" as investors grow weary of Musk's focus on DOGE.               Tesla's dropping value puts pressure on the company's Robotaxi efforts. Ives said he puts \"90%\" of Tesla's value over the next few years on the company's autonomous technology and humanoid robot. Tesla has yet to file for a permit that would allow it to test the vehicle without a safety driver \u2014 a milestone that self-driving car startups Waymo and Zoox hit in 2020 and 2023, respectively.               The company has been on a hiring spree for test drivers across the country. In February, it hosted hiring events in Las Vegas and Dallas, according to a recruiter's post on X. It also posted openings for test drivers in several towns in Texas, Nevada, and California.               In Austin, Tesla has met with members of the city's autonomous vehicle taskforce and discussed robotaxi training for local emergency responders, according to emails viewed by Business Insider. Unlike California, Texas has few regulations around autonomous driving; vehicles are only required to be insured and capable of obeying traffic laws.       Do you work for Tesla or have a tip?

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Benchmark S&P 500 falls 1.39 percent, dragging index more than 10 percent below its February peak. The United States\u2019 stock market has taken another tumble following US President Donald Trump\u2019s threat to impose steep tariffs on wine and other alcoholic products from the European Union. The benchmark S&P 500 fell 1.39 percent on Thursday, dragging the index into a correction \u2013 Wall Street lingo for a decline of 10 percent or more from the peak. Corrections are not unusual in the US stock market, which has consistently recovered from losses over its history, though they can be unsettling for investors in the shortterm. The S&P 500 last entered correction territory in October 2023, when the index slid 10.3 percent from its peak that July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also recorded sharp declines, falling 1.30 percent and 1.96 percent, respectively. The latest losses mean that US stocks have lost more than $5 trillion in market value since their February peak. Trump\u2019s back-and-forth announcements on trade have unnerved markets, with investors struggling to gauge whether his tariffs are here to stay or are a bargaining tactic to extract concessions. \u201cThe main difference between the trade war under Trump 1.0 and Trump 2.0 is duration,\u201d the Kobeissi Letter, a financial newsletter founded by Adam Kobeissi, said on X. \u201cIn his first term, Trump\u2019s tariffs were taken to be more of a posturing tactic. This time around, markets are pricing in tariffs for longer on more trade partners. This is a material change.\u201d In his latest trade salvo on Thursday, Trump threatened to slap a 200 percent tariff on wine, champagne and other alcoholic products from the EU. Trump\u2019s threat came after the bloc announced plans to impose a 50 percent tariff on US bourbon whiskey from April 1 in response to US duties on steel and aluminium that went into effect on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Trump backed off from a threat to impose a 50 percent tariff on Canadian aluminium and steel after the province of Ontario agreed to temporarily suspend a surcharge on electricity exports. Trump and his aides have played down the stock market turmoil as a transition period for the economy. \u201cI think this country is going to boom. But as I said, I can do it the easy way or the hard way,\u201d Trump told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cThe hard way to do it is exactly what I am doing, but the results are going to be 20 times greater.\u201d          Follow Al Jazeera English:","label":1}
{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"ByMoneyShow  ByMoneyShow , Contributor.  The stock market is in a world of hurt, giving up all of its post-election gains due to worries about tariffs, trade wars, and the threat of recession. But gold continues to shine! The yellow metal is getting ever closer to $3,000 an ounce, opening up investment opportunities. Here are some to consider from top MoneyShow experts. There\u2019s something very curious going on in gold \u2014 and it says something about where the yellow metal might be headed. An easy way to play the coming move is through the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD). The first thing you need to know is that seasonally speaking, gold shouldn\u2019t be rallying at all. This is the weak time of the year for gold, as you can see from this chart\u2026 Gold Gold usually doesn\u2019t start making significant gains until April, if then. To be sure, this is an average, and every year is different. But this rally at this time of year is kind of a shocker! So, what makes this year different? \u201cChaos as policy.\u201d First, I\u2019m pretty sure President Trump and his team have set out to \u201cbreak\u201d the US government. That\u2019s what Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, is all about. Their plan is to rebuild and restructure the government, only leaner. Trump says we\u2019ll be much better off when it\u2019s all said and done. In the short term, it\u2019s chaos. Meanwhile, the White House\u2019s on-again, off-again approach to tariffs with our major trading partners is so chaotic, it can barely be called a policy. Chaos scares investors. And that is one of the major forces driving gold higher. Second, this raises the odds of the Federal Reserve cutting benchmark interest rates this year. As recently as Feb. 12, the market was pricing in only one rate cut. While Fed Chair Powell said recently that the Fed wants to take it slow on rate cuts, the market is now pricing in three cuts in 2025, starting in June. Combined with the rate cuts that began last year, America is in a rate-cutting cycle. Now, we don\u2019t know exactly how much gold will run this time around. But odds are it\u2019s going a LOT higher. If the past is a guide, gold will more than double. GLD has a Weiss Rating of \u201cB-\u201d and an expense ratio of just 0.4%, which is pretty cheap. Recommended Action: Buy GLD Gold has been very resilient over the last several weeks. The current range has a much narrower amplitude than those posted over the last year. There are two ways of thinking about it. The first is the pace of the advance is picking up and traders are not willing to wait for a deeper pullback to buy. The second is the trend is still very consistent and a reaction of $200-$250 is still possible. Of course, the other point is this is the US Dollar price of gold. The currency has fallen sharply over the last month so that has helped to support the gold price. In British Pounds, the price of gold has pulled back \u00a3133 from its peak. The October \u2013 January range has a maximum drawdown of \u00a3160. The April-to-September range had an amplitude of \u00a3154. Gold The message is quite similar. The size of the current reaction is smaller than the last two. Since this has occurred against a background of an appreciating Pound, that is good news. It\u2019s a similar story for the Australian Dollar price. This reaction was for A$160. The last two were A$332 and A$351, respectively. When we look at gold priced in several currencies, there is no questioning that the pace of the advance has picked up. This global surge in demand for physical gold has been driven by central banks. Political volatility has increased substantially since Donald Trump took office. The news over the last week has been filled with talk of tariffs and war. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in the minute details of which tariff is being increased or decreased. The bigger message is more important to gold. The US is no longer a reliable partner. That means the status quo is no more and we are entering a new era of great power politics. That is going to have far-reaching consequences. Gold is currently pausing below the big, psychological $3,000 level. Twenty years ago, $3,000 was considered an ambitious, far-away target. Today it is upon us and I don\u2019t hear many people talking about a future price of $5,000 or $10,000. I can\u2019t tell you when those levels will be achieved, but the long-term trend of currency debasement is alive and well. That means those targets are inevitable. The only question is when. Gold is over $2,900 an ounce and headed for $3,000, largely due to global uncertainty and strong central bank purchases by China and other countries. The SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) is ahead nearly 11% in six weeks. I also like Kinross Gold Corp. (KGC). Here\u2019s a surprise: Which is up more over the past 25 years \u2014 gold or stocks? The average investor would answer stocks. But the correct answer is gold. (Editor\u2019s Note: Mark Skousen is speaking at the 2025 MoneyShow\/TradersEXPO Las Vegas, which runs Feb. 17-19. Click HERE to register) As the Wall Street Journal reported recently, the S&P 500 \u2014 including dividends \u2014 returned 525% between 2000 and the end of 2024. But gold increased by more than 800% over the same period, jumping from $281.63 an ounce to $2,603.01. Kinross It remains a great inflation hedge. And mining stocks are a good way to play it. That brings me to KGC. It yields only 1%, but is now up 30% for us. Recommended Action: Buy KGC.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Life these days is expensive. The lingering effects of the pandemic, Russia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s invasion of Ukraine, higher fuel and energy prices, and extreme weather shocks throttling the supply chain have conspired to make many everyday necessities much less affordable. Rising food costs in particular have become a source of financial stress for millions of U.S. households. Though overall inflation has cooled from a record peak in 2022, food prices increased nearly a quarter over the last four years and are expected to continue to climb. So far this year, Americans have faced a nationwide bird flu outbreak, propelling the cost of eggs to record levels, while rising temperatures and erratic rainfall across Western Africa are escalating chocolate prices to new highs. Years of drought in the U.S. have also contributed to historically low levels of cattle inventories, hiking up beef prices. The result is skyrocketing supermarket bills, tighter household budgets, and dwindling access to food. President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest trade decisions aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t likely to help the situation. Amid a flood of announcements about federal funding freezes, food program terminations, and mass government layoffs, the president has been issuing on-again, off-again sanctions aimed at the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 biggest trading partners. In the span of a single week, he enacted blanket tariffs against goods from Mexico, Canada, and China, exempted some products under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, and then doubled tariffs on China before threatening a new set of taxes on Canadian products. On Tuesday, he ordered his administration to double duties on Canadian steel and aluminum imports, which he subsequently walked back to 25 percent before those snapped into effect Wednesday morning, prompting immediate retaliation levies from Canada and the European Union. The pendulum-like nature of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trade policies, economists told Grist, almost certainly means higher grocery store prices. It has already spooked financial markets and prompted major retailers like Target\u00e2\u0080\u0099s CEO Brian Cornell to warn that if some of the promised tariffs go into effect, customers could see sticker shock for fresh produce \u00e2\u0080\u009cwithin days.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen it comes to extreme weather shocks, which are destroying our supply chains, climate change is increasing prices and creating food inflation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Seungki Lee, an agricultural economist at Ohio State University. If policymakers don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fully account for that by adjusting trade policies, he said, then to some degree, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwe will see the compounding impacts of tariffs and climate change-related shocks on the supply chain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Tariffs, or taxes charged on goods imported from other countries, are typically a negotiation tactic waged by governments in a game of international trade, with consumers and producers caught in the crosshairs. When goods enter a country, tariffs are calculated as a percentage of their value and paid by the importer. The importer may then choose to pass on the cost to consumers, which, in the case of something like fresh fruit grown in Mexico, often ends up being everyday people. Given the extent of the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0099 dependence on Canada, Mexico, and China for agricultural trade, farmers, analysts, business leaders, policymakers, and the general public have all raised concerns over the effect of tariffs on grocery store prices and the possibility of trade wars slowing economic growth. During the first Trump term, levies on China triggered retaliatory tariffs that decimated agricultural exports and commodity prices, costing the U.S. agricultural industry more than $27 billion, which the government then had to cover with subsidy payouts. To date, the U.S. has not fully recovered its loss in market share of soybean exports to China, its biggest agricultural export market. An analysis by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit organization, found that the 2018 trade war with China was largely passed through as increases in U.S. prices, reducing consumers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 income by about $1.4 billion per month. Rural agricultural sectors in the Midwest and the mountain west were hit harder by China\u00e2\u0080\u0099s retaliatory tariffs than most others, the analysis found. This time around, Trump appears to have doubled down on the tactic, though the demands and messaging of his tariff policy have remained wildly unpredictable, with economists dubbing the president an \u00e2\u0080\u009cagent of chaos and confusion.\u00e2\u0080\u009d All told, China, Canada, and Mexico supplied roughly 40 percent of the goods the U.S. imported last year. In 2023, Mexico alone was the source of about two-thirds of vegetables imported to the U.S., nearly half fruit and nut imports, and about 90 percent of avocados\u00c2\u00a0 consumed nationwide. Without factoring in any retaliatory tariffs, estimates suggest that the levies imposed by Trump last week could amount to an average tax increase of anywhere between $830 a year and $1,072 per U.S. household. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a little nervous about the increase in tension,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt could lead to an immediate shock in supermarket prices.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Canada and China have since responded with tariffs of their own. Canada\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tariffs imposed last week amounted to nearly $21 billion on U.S. goods, including orange juice, peanut butter, and coffee. China imposed 15 percent levies on wheat, corn, and chicken produced by U.S. farmers, in addition to 10 percent tariffs on products including soybeans, pork, beef, and fruit\u00c2\u00a0that went into effect on Monday. Meanwhile, Mexico planned to announce retaliatory tariffs but instead celebrated Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to postpone. On Wednesday, in response to Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s steel and aluminum tariff hike, Canadian officials announced a second $20.7 billion wave of duties and the European Union declared it would begin retaliatory trade action next month for a range of U.S. industrial and farm goods that includes sugar, beef, eggs, poultry, peanut butter, and bourbon. With Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s planned tariffs, Americans can expect to see fresh produce shipped from Mexico \u00e2\u0080\u0094 such as tomatoes, strawberries, avocados, limes, mangos, and papayas, as well as types of tequila and beer \u00e2\u0080\u0094 become more expensive. Other agricultural products sourced from Canada, including fertilizer, chocolate, canola oil, maple syrup, and pork are also likely to see cost hikes. New duties on potash, a key ingredient in fertilizer, and steel used in agricultural machinery coming from Canada could also indirectly elevate food prices. Many of these products, such as avocados, vegetable oils, cocoa, and mangoes, are already seeing surging price tags in part because of rising temperatures. Though there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no shortage of questions surrounding Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tariff policy right now, James Sayre, an agricultural economist at the University of California, Davis, said that even this current state of international trade uncertainty will lead to a higher grocery cost burden for consumers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll of this uncertainty is really bad for businesses hoping to import, or establish new supply chains abroad, or for any large-scale investment,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Sayre. \u00e2\u0080\u009cJust this degree of uncertainty will increase prices for consumers and reduce consumer choice at the supermarket \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 even more than tariffs themselves.\u00e2\u0080\u009d All the while, climate change continues to fuel food inflation, leaving American consumers to foot the bill of a warming world and the cascading effects of an administration seemingly set on upending global trade relations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt is actually a little bit hard to anticipate what we can expect from the current administration when we are seeing the burden of food inflation by tariffs or trade, and also at the same time, we have climate-related shocks on the supply chain,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Lee. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHopefully we will not see an unexpected compounding effect by these two very different animals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This article originally appeared in Grist at https:\/\/grist.org\/food-and-agriculture\/what-trumps-escalating-trade-wars-mean-for-your-grocery-bill\/.\u00c2\u00a0Grist is a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"A lawyer in Argentina has asked Interpol to issue a \u00e2\u0080\u009cRed Notice\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the arrest of Hayden Mark Davis, a U.S. citizen who designed $LIBRA memecoin. Argentina wants Davis really bad. Argentine president Javier Milei promoted the coin alongside Davis. It crashed and people lost a lot of money. Now Milei is facing possible impeachment, and Davis is facing possible extradition. Gregorio Dalb\u00c3\u00b3n filed the request with Interpol this week and argued that Davis posed a unique flight risk. According to Dalb\u00c3\u00b3n, the 28-year-old crypto entrepreneur has the money and the inclination to flee justice. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe possibility that Davis will abandon his country of residence or hide to avoid answering for his alleged acts appears to be aggravated by the economic resources he possesses, which he can use to move or remain in hiding, hindering our investigation,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dalb\u00c3\u00b3n said in court documents reviewed by Fortune. A Red Notice is like an international arrest warrant. If granted, it would mean that authorities in the U.S. could arrest Davis and ship him to Argentina. Davis created the $LIBRA memecoin and got Milei to promote it on Valentine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Day. Its value skyrocketed to a market cap of $4.5 billion before crashing hard to $18 million. More than 10,000 people lost around $250 million. Davis, of course, sold just before the crash and said he pocketed $100 million. $LIBRA wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Davis\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first pump and dump meme coin scheme. In January, following the launch of President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s $TRUMP memecoin, Davis launched $MELANIA. Confusion abounded. Investors thought that First Lady Melania Trump had launched her own memecoin similar to her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s. But it was just Davis doing his thing. Like $LIBRA, $MELANIA soared and then crashed. Davis and Milei weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t secret about their relationship. The President of Argentina posted photos of himself posing with Davis on X, and the crypto-pumper talked about their relationship on podcasts. A report from CoinDesk claimed that Davis bragged about dog-walking Milei. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI control that n\u00e2\u0080\u0094,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Davis allegedly said in a text viewed by CoinDesk. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI send $$ to his sister and he signs whatever I say and does what I want.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Davis\u00e2\u0080\u0099 bad behavior is legendary in the crypto community. On February 17, days after Milie promoted the coin, entrepreneur Steven Enamakel shared a story on X about Davis sticking him with a $2,000 sushi bill. According to Enamakel, Davis invited him to Nobu in Los Angeles to discuss the pending launch of an NFT collection. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHayden ordered almost everything that was super expensive in the menu,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Enamakel said on X. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhen the food came, I never saw a person eat so much sushi so quickly. I wondered if it was humanly possible to consume that much sushi but there it happened right there in front of me.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When the bill came, David hid in the bathroom. Enamakel waited for 20 minutes for him to return but ended up paying the bill himself because it was getting late and he needed to leave. The moment he paid, Davis returned and said the next meal was on him. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter that he then went ahead [and] screwed up my NTF launch,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Enamakel said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI should have known better.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Argentine investigation into $LIBRA started a few days after Milei promoted it online. The probe is investigating whether Milei and Davis conspired to commit fraud. Possible charges for Davis could include bribery and influence peddling.  argentinaCryptoJavier Mileilibramemecoins  \r           Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r          \r           News from the future, delivered to your present.\r          \r       Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r                 Surely this is all on the level.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Business Insider Edition  After days of pain brought on by President Donald Trump's trade war, markets got some relief in Friday's session as developments in Washington, DC, indicated the government will avoid a shutdown.          Major stock averages rose sharply on the unexpected news that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer would support the six-month stopgap bill from Republicans. The benchmark Samp;P 500 increased as much as 2% on Friday, with the biggest gains coming in the afternoon. It helped claw back some of the week's losses, although the benchmark is still down 2.5% over the past five days.               The Nasdaq jumped as much as 2.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average peaked with a nearly-700-point gain.               Here's where the market stood around 1:30 a.m. ET Friday:               Though Schumer pledged to oppose the bill earlier in the week, signaling the Democrats would opt for a shutdown, he ultimately conceded that his party would wield no control in such a scenario.               \"The total off-ramp of a shutdown, how you stop a shutdown, is totally determined by the Republican House and Senate, and that is totally determined because they've shown complete, blind obeisance [to] Trump, DOGE, etc. They could keep us in a shutdown for months and months and months,\" he told reporters.               While the move has angered some fellow Democrats who were ready to oppose the spending bill, investors cheered Schumer's about-face as it removed a layer of uncertainty in what's been a trying week for markets.               The exuberance was enough for markets to sidestep fresh signs of consumer weakness. Friday's consumer sentiment report was the lowest reading since 2022, with US consumers facing tariff uncertainty and inflation fears.               A barrage of tariff news this week crushed investor confidence and sent volatility soaring. The S&P 500 ended Thursday's session in a correction, down 10% from its February 19 high.               At the same time, gold reached a record high of $3,000 an ounce on Friday, while Treasury yields have dropped in an investor flight to safety.               Even with markets in retreat, the Trump White House has remained unfazed. On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the administration isn't worried about a \"little bit of volatility,\" and the focus is on the broader economy.

The Can Manufacturers Institute highlighted that today there are only three domestic tin mill lines still open in the U.S. With a 25% tariff on aluminum and steel imports taking effect this week, metals-dependent trade groups in the U.S. are calling on the Trump administration for exemptions. Robert Budway, president of the Can Manufacturers Institute, said in a statement Wednesday that consumers will feel inflationary impacts from the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.\u00a0 \u201cRecent history has demonstrated that trade protectionist measures have serious impacts for the U.S. economy and domestic food security,\" he said. \u201cAluminum and steel tariffs place price pressures on American-produced goods by artificially and dramatically increasing the cost of critical production materials, making U.S.-made food less competitive against foreign products.\u201d According to CMI, the domestic can industry produces approximately 135 billion food, beverage, aerosol and general line cans each year and employs more than 28,000 people. Since 2018 tariffs, U.S. tin mill steel producers shut down nine tin mill lines. \u201cToday, only three domestic production lines remain open in the United States, meaning American steel producers cannot meet U.S. demand even with the highest tinplate steel costs in the world,\u201d Budway said. \u201cThis opens the door for cheaper canned foods to flood the U.S. market from China and other foreign competitors.\u201d According to the Aluminum Association, the U.S.\u00a0aluminum industry has invested more than $10 billion\u00a0since 2016, largely in \u201cmid-and-downstream production and recycling.\u201d \u201cThis has been driven by growing demand, a competitive tax environment and strong, targeted trade enforcement the president supported in his first term,\u201d CEO Charles Johnson said in a statement Wednesday.\u00a0\u201cFor this growth to continue, the U.S. aluminum industry needs two things \u2014\u00a0long-term market certainty and a reliable supply of affordable metal, which today comes in large part from Canada.\u201d Johnson described U.S. industry\u2019s longstanding trade relationship with Canada \u201ca good deal for America\u201d and called for a deal with Canada that secures robust supply. Canada supplies about two-thirds of the primary aluminum used in the U.S., according to the Aluminum Association. In 2023, the U.S. imported 7.71 billion pounds of aluminum from Canada. In a February letter to Trump, CMI, along with American canned food producers and packaging companies such as Silgan, Sonoco, Crown and Trivium, called for exemptions.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Business Insider Edition  The stock market has been badly hurt by President Donald Trump's trade war so far, but one Wall Street research firm says there are potential catalysts on the horizon that could help turn the situation around for investors.          Strategists at BCA Research said they see a handful of \"upside scenarios\" that could restart the rally. Though the scenarios may all be longshots, they're all plausible \u2014 and could lead to the major indexes climbing back to all-time-highs, Peter Berezin, the chief global strategist at the firm, said.               The call is notable coming from BCA, which has called for a recession in 2025 and has one the lowest price targets for the S&P 500 on Wall Street this year.               \"We continue to maintain a bearish view on equities on the grounds that the US will likely enter a recession this year,\" Berezin said. \"All that said, despite our bearish predisposition towards stocks, we are open-minded to anything that could challenge our thesis.\"               Here are five things the firm thinks could spark a turnaround for the market.                Trump used the stock market to gauge the success of his presidency during his first term, though he's less focused on the market now. However, the president could be disciplined by markets and soften his trade policy as the decline in stocks becomes too steep to ignore.               That dynamic hasn't played out so far. Berezin pointed to instances where Trump's team has communicated that the president is no longer using the stock market as a barometer for his success.               Last weekend, Trump also acknowledged that the economy was going through a \"period of transition\" after his latest round of tariffs, which suggested to markets that the president is okay with some volatility for now. On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated the administration's view that it will tolerate market volatility as it pursues its policy goals.                \"Our strong suspicion is that the tolerance among Americans for economic pain is very low, especially in the case where the pain seems self-inflicted. This suggests that Trump will back down,\" Berezin said.               Markets have been concerned that bond investors could stage a big sell-off in a revolt against Trump's plan to extend his 2017 tax cuts. That would send yields spiking toward a level that could hurt stocks.                There's a chance that doesn't happen though, which would be positive for equities, BCA Research said.               The yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond, an indicator of long-term interest rate expectations in the economy, spiked as high as 4.8% in early January \u2014 one sign that investors anticipated less demand for the US debt, which could be due to concerns about an unsustainable fiscal situation.                 Yields have since declined, a sign that those worries have abated for now. The 10-year yield traded around 4.3% on Friday.               \"Investors should monitor Treasury term premia to gauge whether risk premia on bonds are rising to dangerous levels. So far, that has not happened,\" Berezin said.               Fiscal stimulus and structural reforms in Europe could end up boosting growth abroad \u2014 something that could be a positive for US markets as well.               \"There is significant scope for gains from knocking down internal barriers to trade. This is true in the European Union. It is also true in countries such as Canada,\" Berezin said, pointing to estimates that removing trade barriers impacting Canada could raise GDP by as much as 8% in the nation.       European stocks have already done well so far this year. The EURO STOXX 50 Index is up 9% since the start of January, outperforming the S&P 500, which is down 5% year-to-date.       Oil prices are already depressed but they could fall further as a result of Trump's plan to boost US energy production. When prices slump as the result of increased supply, that has traditionally been a positive signal for stocks, Berezin said.               Things already look positive on the production side. OPEC+ has said it would wind back some of its production curbs starting in April of this year, and Trump, who declared a national energy emergency on his first day in office, has said he would pour more resources into US energy infrastructure.               Oil prices have declined since the start of the year. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded around $70 a barrel on Friday, down from a peak of $82 a barrel earlier in the year.               AI could end up boosting productivity way more than expected, which would be be a boon for the US economy and markets, the firm said.               BCA Research estimated that growth could scale anywhere from 30 to 100 times as a result of AI. That's similar to what the US economy saw during the agricultural and industrial revolutions, it noted.               Still, the firm noted that productivity gains could take a while to show up in the economy. And while the US is in the midst of an AI investment boom, there are depreciating returns on those investments, which could pose a risk to investors.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"The classic arcade game\u00c2\u00a0Asteroids is so accessible and timeless that every time I see a vector graphics triangle, it acts as a reminder of the retro gaming era.\u00c2\u00a0The original arcade cabinet hit the scene in 1979, while the more familiar Atari 2600 title debuted in 1981. Forty-five years after the game\u2019s debut, Atari worked with watch brand Nubeo to create a series of limited edition mechanical timepieces to mark the anniversary. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve slapped one around my wrist, and now, whenever I look down, I can almost hear the UFO sound effect warbling in my mind. The company sent us one of the limited edition watches for review. Ours is the Nebula Blue, numbered 104 out of 125. The classic triangular ship in the center of the watch face spins indefinitely, acting as the seconds hand. Two flying saucers tick out the hours and minutes, slowly rotating around the center. The rest of the stenciled asteroids are merely decoration. It takes more than a few seconds of squinting to gauge the time on the crowded watch face. In dim light, the blue UFO tends to blend into the background. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the point of a watch that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not great for telling the time? Kids these days may have difficulty reading the hands on analog clocks, but the Nubeo and Atari collaboration seems very specific to the aging gamer with rose-colored glasses for a past age of gaming. The default silicon watch band and its fancy clasp are built for medium-to-large-sized wrists. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an average-sized adult male, and I needed to use the smallest bead on the band to keep it from sliding down while typing out this review. The Nubeo-Atari collab is a hypnotic scene of floating rocks on a black field. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a large watch face that is 50mm and 16mm thick. With those specs, the watch isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t light either at 179 grams or nearly .4 pounds. At the very least, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a well-constructed timepiece. It uses a Japanese automatic watch system powered by wrist movement rather than a battery. It sports a sapphire lens with a stainless steel case in both black and brushed metal. To round off the aesthetic, so many little accents make this watch unique, from the Atari logo on the crown to the stenciled asteroids on the back of the watch. All the different versions of the Atari-Nubeo collab are limited edition, and the version in my possession is currently sold out. The stated MSRP is $1,650, but we doubt it will ever leave the sale price of $500 before stock runs dry. Even that price point is a lot for a watch, especially for those not used to dropping multiple Benjamins on a single accessory. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something to be said for gamer chic, but this seems designed for older nerds with deep pockets. The $500 price is more than many are willing to spend on a\u00c2\u00a0solid smartwatch today.\u00c2\u00a0An Apple Watch Series 9 starts at $400, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at the high end of what you can get without opting for \u00e2\u0080\u009cUltra\u201d variants. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not one to regularly accessorize, but I was already such a big fan of the Timestop D-20 watch (which I still regularly wear to my TRPG table), I now plan to take the Nubeo on the road with me. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not a member of the generation who could have played Asteroids in its glory days.\u00c2\u00a0Instead, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve played the classic game on aging cabinets in the odd barcade, or failed to keep my ship alive for more than a few levels on the Atari 7800+. The game is still one of the most interesting designs of the arcade era. Players don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just need to factor in momentum, but the \u00e2\u0080\u009chyperspace\u00e2\u0080\u009d mechanic where you and asteroids can dive through one side of the screen and come out on the other. Before spending $500 on a watch, consider a few more things. For one, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only rated 5 ATM, which is water\u00e2\u0080\u0094and dust-resistant only to a certain extent. You should be safe dunking it in water but can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t snorkel with it. Each watch has a two-year warranty for any defect with the mechanics or materials.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Stock markets took another hit on Thursday, with several key benchmarks slipping into correction territory \u2014 a sign that Wall Street may be losing momentum in the early days of the second Trump administration. The downturn reflects rising investor anxiety over the administration\u2019s unpredictable policy moves. Sudden shifts in tariffs and federal job cuts have left many investors feeling uneasy. A market correction occurs when a stock index, individual stock, or other financial asset drops 10% or more but less than 20% from its recent peak. The term \u201ccorrection\u201d reflects the idea that prices are adjusting from overvalued levels. It\u2019s called a correction because the drop often \u201ccorrects\u201d and returns prices to their longer-term trend. Corrections can happen in any type of investment, but they\u2019re most common in the stock market when investors get nervous about things like the economy, interest rates, or global events. While a correction might seem worrying, it\u2019s normally short-lived and just part of the market\u2019s natural ups and downs. As of March 13, 2025, the major U.S. stock indices have suffered notable declines from their recent highs. The S&P 500 fell nearly 10% to about 5,578 since reaching a peak of 6,144 on Feb. 19. The Dow Jones industrial average has fallen approximately 9% to about 41,132 from its December high of 45,073. And the Nasdaq composite has dropped down more than 13% to about 17,539 from its recent peak of 20,204. The main difference between a market correction and a bear market is the depth of the decline.  A correction is a drop of 10% or more and can last weeks to a few months. They are often temporary and driven by factors like economic data, interest rates, or geopolitical uncertainty. A bear market is a more severe downturn of 20% or more, that can stretch over several months or longer. Bear markets typically signal deeper economic trouble, such as a recession or financial crisis.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"\ufeffWhy CPO Mike Krieger thinks Anthropic can win without beating ChatGPT. \ufeffWhy CPO Mike Krieger thinks Anthropic can win without beating ChatGPT. by  Alex Heath Anthropic is one of the world\u2019s leading AI model providers, especially in areas like coding. But its AI assistant, Claude, is nowhere near as popular as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. According to chief product officer Mike Krieger, Anthropic doesn\u2019t plan to win the AI race by building a mainstream AI assistant. \u201cI hope Claude reaches as many people as possible,\u201d Krieger told me onstage at the HumanX AI conference earlier this week. \u201cBut I think, [for] our ambitions, the critical path isn\u2019t through mass-market consumer adoption right now.\u201d Instead, Krieger says Anthropic is focused on two things: building the best models; and what he calls \u201cvertical experiences that unlock agents.\u201d The first of these is Claude Code, Anthropic\u2019s AI coding tool that Krieger says amassed 100,000 users within its first week of availability. He says there are more of these so-called agents for specific use cases coming this year and that Anthropic is working on \u201csmaller, cheaper models\u201d for developers. (And, yes, there are future versions of its biggest and most capable model, Opus, coming at some point, too.) Krieger made his name as the cofounder of Instagram and then the news aggregation app Artifact before joining Anthropic nearly a year ago. \u201cOne of the reasons I joined Anthropic is that I think we have a unique role that we can play in shaping what the future of human-AI interaction looks like,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we have a differentiated take on that. How can we empower rather than just be a pure replacement for people? How do we make people aware of both the potentials and the limitations of AI?\u201d Given its history, Anthropic is considered to be one of the more cautious labs. But now it seems set on making its models less sanitized. The company\u2019s latest release, Sonnet 3.7, will refuse to answer a prompt 45 percent less often than before, according to Krieger. \u201cThere are going to be some models that are going to be super YOLO and then other models that may be even more cautious. I\u2019ll be really happy if people feel like our models are striking that balance.\u201d Krieger and I covered a lot of ground during our chat at HumanX \u2014 a condensed version of which you can read below. I asked him about how Anthropic decides to compete with its API customers, such as the AI coding tool Cursor, how product development works inside a frontier AI lab, and even what he thinks sets Anthropic apart from OpenAI\u2026 The following interview has been edited for length and clarity: When you\u2019re building and thinking about the next couple of years of Anthropic, is it an enterprise company? Is it a consumer company? Is it both? We want to help people get work done \u2013 whether it\u2019s coding, whether it\u2019s knowledge work, etc. The parts we\u2019re less focused on are what I would think of as more the entertainment, consumer use case. I actually think there\u2019s a dramatic underbuilding still in consumer and AI. But it\u2019s less of what we\u2019re focused on right now. Having run a billion-user service, it\u2019s really fun. It\u2019s very cool to get to build at that scale. I hope Claude reaches as many people as possible, but I think, [for] our ambitions, the critical path isn\u2019t through mass-market consumer adoption right now.  What is the path? One is to continue to build and train the best models in the world. We have a fantastic research team. We\u2019ll continue to invest in that and build on the things that we\u2019re already good at and make those available via an API.  The other one is building vertical experiences that unlock agents. The way I think about it is AI doing more than just single-turn work for you, either for your personal life or in the workplace. Claude Code is our first take on a vertical agent with coding, and we\u2019ll do others that play to our model\u2019s advantages and help solve problems for people, including data integration. You\u2019ll see us go beyond just Claude AI and Claude Code with some other agents over the coming year. People really love Cursor, which is powered by your models. How do you decide where to compete with your customers? Because that\u2019s ultimately what you\u2019re doing with Claude Code. I think this is a really delicate question for all of the labs and one that I\u2019m trying to approach really thoughtfully. For example, I called Cursor\u2019s CEO and basically all of our leading coding customers to give them a heads-up that we\u2019re launching Claude Code because I see it as complementary. We\u2019re hearing from people using both. The same model that\u2019s available in Claude Code is the same one that\u2019s powering Cursor. It\u2019s the same one that\u2019s powering Windsurf, and it\u2019s powering GitHub Copilot now. A year ago, none of those products even existed except for Copilot. Hopefully, we\u2019ll all be able to navigate the occasionally closer adjacencies. You\u2019re helping power the new Alexa. Amazon is a big investor in Anthropic. How did that [product partnership] come about, and what does it mean for Anthropic? It was my third week at Anthropic. They had a lot of energy to do something new. I was very excited about the opportunity because, when you think about what we can bring to the table, it\u2019s frontier models and the know-how about how to make those models work really well for really complex use cases. What they have is an incredible number of devices and reach and integrations.  It\u2019s actually one of the two things I\u2019ve gotten to code at Anthropic. More recently, I got to build some stuff with Claude Code, which is great for managers because you can delegate work before a meeting and then catch up with it after a meeting and see what it did. Then, with Alexa, I coded a simple prototype of what it would mean to talk to an Alexa-type system with a Claude model. I know you\u2019re not going to explain the details of the Alexa deal, but what does it mean for your models? We can\u2019t go into the exact economics of it. It\u2019s something that was really exciting for both of the companies. It really pushed us because, to do Alexa-type workflows really well, latency matters a ton. Part of the partnership was that we pulled forward probably a year\u2019s worth of optimization work into three to six months. I love those customers that push us and set super ambitious deadlines. It benefits everybody because some of those improvements make it into the models that everybody gets to use now. Would you like more distribution channels like Alexa? It seems like Apple needs some help with Siri. Is that something you guys would like to do? I would love to power as many of those things as possible. When I think about what we can do, it\u2019s really in that consultation and partnership place. Hardware is not an area that I\u2019m looking at internally right now because, when we think about our current advantages, you have to pick and choose. How do you, as a CPO, work at such a research-driven company like Anthropic? How can you even foresee what\u2019s going to happen when there\u2019s maybe a new research breakthrough just around the corner? We think a lot about the vertical agents that we want to deliver by the end of this year. We want to help you do research and analysis. There are a bunch of interesting knowledge worker use cases we want to enable. If it\u2019s important for some of that data to be in the pretraining phase, that decision needs to happen now if we want to manifest that by midyear or even later. You both need to operate very, very quickly in delivering the product but also operate flexibly and have the vision of where you want to be in six months so that you can inform that research direction.  We had the idea for more agentic coding products when I started, but the models weren\u2019t quite where we wanted to be to deliver the product. As we started approaching the 3.7 Sonnet launch, we were like, \u201cThis is feeling good.\u201d So it\u2019s a dance. If you wait until the model\u2019s perfect, you\u2019re too late because you should have been building that product ahead of time. But you have to be okay with sometimes the model not being where you needed it and be flexible around shipping a different manifestation of that product. You guys are leading the model work on coding. Have you started reforecasting how you are going to hire engineers and headcount allocation? I sat with one of our engineers who\u2019s using Claude Code. He was like, \u201cYou know what the hard part is? It\u2019s still aligning with design and PM and legal and security on actually shipping products.\u201d Like any complex system, you solve one bottleneck, and you\u2019re going to hit some other area where it is more constrained. This year, we\u2019re still hiring a bunch of software engineers. In the long run, though, hopefully your designers can get further along the stack by being able to take their Figmas and then have the first version running or three versions running. When product managers have an idea \u2014 it\u2019s already happening inside Anthropic \u2014 they can prototype that first version using Claude Code.  In terms of the absolute number of engineers, it\u2019s hard to predict, but hopefully it means we\u2019re delivering more products and you expand your scope rather than just trying to ship the same thing a little bit faster. Shipping things faster is still bound by more human factors than just coding. What would you say to someone who is evaluating a job between OpenAI and Anthropic? Spend time with both teams. I think that the products are different. The internal cultures are quite different. I think there\u2019s definitely a heavier emphasis on alignment and AI safety [at Anthropic], even if on the product side that manifests itself a little bit less than on the pure research side. A thing that we have done well, and I really hope we preserve, is that it\u2019s a very integrated culture without a lot of fiefdoms and silos. A thing I think we\u2019ve done uniquely well is that there are research folks talking to product [teams] all the time. They welcome our product feedback to the research models. It still feels like one team, one company, and the challenge as we scale is keeping that.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Listen to Esme read this article Donald Trump's return to the White House is a \"major blow to global climate action\". So said Christiana Figueres, the former UN climate chief, after he was elected in November. Since taking office, Trump has withdrawn the US from what is considered the most important global climate pact, the Paris Climate Agreement. He has also reportedly prevented US scientists from participating in international climate research and removed national electric vehicle targets. Plus, he derided his predecessor's attempts to develop new green technology a \"green new scam\". And yet despite his history on the issue of climate, Trump has been eager to make a deal with the Ukrainian president on critical minerals. He has also taken a strong interest in Greenland and Canada \u2013 both nations rich in critical minerals. Critical mineral procurement has been a major focus for Trump since he took office. These minerals are crucial in industries including aerospace and defence, but intriguingly, they have another major use too - to manufacture green technology. So, could Trump's focus on obtaining these minerals have a knock-on effect, and help unlock the US's potential in the green technology sector? Trump's right-hand man understands more than most the importance of critical minerals in the green transition. Space X and Tesla \u2013 the companies Elon Musk leads - rely heavily on critical minerals like graphite (in electric vehicles), lithium (in batteries) and nickel (in rockets). Elizabeth Holley, an associate professor of mining engineering at Colorado School of Mines, explains that each nation has its own list of critical minerals, but they are generally made up of rare earths and other metals like lithium. She says demand is booming - in 2023, demand for lithium grew by 30%. This is being driven mostly by the rapid growth in the clean energy and electric vehicle sectors. Within two decades, they will make up almost 90% of the demand for lithium, 70% of the demand for cobalt, and 40% for rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency. Such has been Musk's concern with getting hold of some of these minerals that three years ago he tweeted: \"Price of lithium has gone to insane levels! Tesla might actually have to get into the mining & refining directly at scale, unless costs improve.\" He went on to write that there is no shortage of the element, but the pace of extraction is slow. The weakness of the US position in rare earths and critical minerals (such as cobalt and nickel) was addressed in a report published by a US Government Select Committee in December 2023. It said: \"The United States must rethink its policy approach to critical mineral and rare earth element supply chains because of the risks posed by our current dependence on the People's Republic of China.\" Failure to do so, it warned, could cause \"defense production to grind to a halt and choke off manufacturing of other advanced technologies\". China's dominance in the market has come from its early recognition of the economic opportunities that green technology offers. \"China made a decision about 10 years ago about where the trend was going and has strategically pursued the development of not just renewables but also electric vehicles and now dominates the market,\" says Bob Ward, policy director at The London School of Economics (LSE) Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment. Daisy Jennings-Gray, head of prices at price reporting agency Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, explains that they are critical minerals because they are geologically restricted. \"You cannot guarantee you will have economically recoverable reserves in every country.\" Some minerals like lithium are abundant on Earth, but often they are located in difficult to reach places, so the logistics of a mining project can be very expensive. In other cases, there is dependency on one country that produces a large share of global supply \u2013 like cobalt from the the Democratic Republic of Congo. This means that if there is a natural disaster or political unrest it has an impact on the price, says Ms Jennings-Gray. China has managed to shore up supply by investing heavily in Africa and South America, but where it really has a stronghold on the market is in processing (or the separation of the mineral from other elements in the rock). \"China accounts for 60% of global rare earth production but processes nearly 90% - [it] is dominant on this stage,\" says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC.  She says the country understands how important this is in economic trade - a few days after Trump introduced tariffs on China its government hit back by imposing export controls on more than 20 critical minerals including graphite and tungsten. What is motivating Trump is a fear of being at a disadvantage, argues Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  \"I think what is driving this is because China is the dominant player on the processing side,\" he says. \"It is that processing stage, which is the high-margin stage of the business, so China is making a lot of money.\" As he puts it, it is a \"happy coincidence\" that this could end up supporting green technology. The key question, though, is whether the US is too late to fully capitalise on the sector. In the early days, the green transition was \"framed as a burden\" for countries, according to LSE's Bob Ward.  The Biden administration was highly supportive of green technology industries through its introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022, which offers tax credits, loans and other incentives to technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, from battery technologies for electric vehicles to solar panels.  By August 2024, it was estimated to have brought $493bn (\u00a3382bn) of investment to US green industry, according to the think tank Clean Investment Monitor. And yet little work was done to support upstream processes like obtaining critical minerals, says Ms Gray from Benchmark Intelligence. Instead, the Biden administration focused heavily on downstream manufacturing - the process of getting products from the manufacturer to the end consumer. But Trump's recent moves to procure these critical minerals suggest a focus on the upstream process may now be happening. \"The IRA put a lot of legislation in places to limit trade and supply only from friendly nations,\" explains Ms Gray. \"Trump is changing tack and looking at securing critical minerals agreements that owes something to the US.\" There could be further moves from Trump coming down the line. Those working in the sector say whispers in the corridors of the White House suggest that he may be about to pass a \"Critical Minerals Executive Order\", which could funnel further investment into this objective. The exact details that may be included in the executive order remain unclear, but experts knowledgeable with the issue have said it may include measures to accelerate mining in the US, including fast tracking permits and investment to construct processing plants. Although work may now be under way to secure these minerals, Prof Willy Shih of Harvard Business School thinks that the US administration lacks understanding of the technical complexity of establishing mineral supply chains, and emphasises the time commitment required. \"If you want to build a new mine and processing facility, it might take you 10 years.\" As a policy of his predecessor, and one that is so obviously pro-climate action, Trump has been vocally opposed to maintaining the IRA. But its success in red states mean that many Republican senators have been trying to convince him to keep it in some form in his proposed \"big, beautiful bill\" - the plan to pile all of Trump's main policy goals into one mega-bill - due to be revealed later this month. Analysis by the Clean Investment Monitor shows in the last 18 months Republican-held states had received 77% of the investment. MIT's Dr Knittel says for states like Georgia, which has become part of what is now known as the \"battery belt\" following a boom in battery production following IRA support, these tax credits are crucial for these industries to survive. He adds that failure to do so poses a real political threat for US representatives who are up for re-election in less than two years. If Trump loses even just one seat to the Democrats in the 2026 mid-terms, then he loses the house majority - limiting his ability to pass key pieces of legislation.  Carl Fleming was an advisor to former President Biden's Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Advisory Committee and is a partner at law firm McDermott, Will & Emery, advising clients in the clean tech and energy space. He says that despite the uncertainty, investors remain confident. \"In the last month, my practice has been busier than ever, and this is since quadrupling last year following the IRA.\" He also believes that there is a recognition of the need to maintain parts of the IRA \u2013 although this may be alongside expansion of some fossil fuels. \"If you are really trying to be 'America First' and energy secure, you want to pull on all your levers. Keep solar and keep battery storage going and add more natural gas to release America's energy prowess.\" But the uncertainty of the US position is little consolation for its absence on the international climate stage, says LSE's Bob Ward. \"When the Americans are on the ball it helps to move people in the right direction and that's how we got the Paris Climate Agreement.\" For those in the climate space, Trump is certainly not an environmentalist. What's clear is he is not concerned with making his legacy an environmental one but an economic one - though he could achieve the former if he can be convinced it will boost the economy.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"ByCatherine Brock  ByCatherine Brock , Contributor.  Bullish analysts predict strong growth for Coinbase over the next three years.  In February, Coinbase wowed analysts and investors with a consensus-beating fourth-quarter report. But COIN stock is still down double digits this year as economic uncertainty takes hold in the U.S. The leading crypto exchange has some good things going for it, including an expanding business model and a crypto-friendly U.S. president. Can Coinbase leverage these factors to rise up and pay handsome returns by 2028? Let's review the company's current state and analysts' expectations to find out. Coinbase stock listed on the Nasdaq as COIN in April 2021. The opening price was $381 per share. COIN rose to $429.54 during the first trading day but closed lower at $328.28. Today, Coinbase trades for about $178. COIN stock had a rough 2022 as cryptocurrency prices fell, stifling trading activity. In December of that year, the share price had dropped as low as $31.83. The crypto exchange stock has since made a rocky climb back to the current trading price\u2014which is about half its opening IPO value. Coinbase revenues come from trading fees, subscriptions and services. The trading fee revenue grows and dips with crypto prices. Higher crypto prices encourage more revenue-generating transactions for Coinbase, while falling crypto prices do the opposite. The subscription and service revenues are less volatile. The company has nearly tripled these revenues since 2022, but they accounted for just 37% of total sales in 2024. Even with the rising subscription and services revenue, Coinbase stock price movements have roughly aligned with Bitcoin price trends. This makes sense: Bitcoin comprised 32% of Coinbase\u2019s 2024 trading volume. So far in 2025, Bitcoin is down 12% and Coinbase is down 23%. Over the past six months, Bitcoin is up 42% and Coinbase is up 22%. Bitcoin is the world's largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization of nearly $2 trillion in 2025. Catalysts that could drive the Coinbase stock price higher or lower over the next three years include the performance of crypto, regulation and litigation trends, institutional trading volume and Coinbase's expansion efforts. Enthusiasm for crypto trading is good for Coinbase\u2019s bottom line. There is a point at which this relationship backfires, however. Since going public, Coinbase has underperformed Bitcoin. This prompts an opportunity-cost question for investors bullish on Bitcoin: Invest in Bitcoin directly for potentially higher returns or invest in Coinbase stock? Either strategy includes exposure to Bitcoin's downside. That downside includes reactivity to economic news. In the immediate future, any signs of recession or inflation in the U.S. would be bad for crypto prices and Coinbase. Longer term, the next Bitcoin halving will encourage Bitcoin appreciation, potentially pushing other cryptocurrencies higher also. Halvings reduce the rate at which new Bitcoins are minted. The last halving was in April 2024 and the next should happen in April 2028. Many expect a light regulatory environment for crypto trading during President Trump\u2019s second term. Trump has promised as much, according to an AP report. He's also said he will establish a federal crypto reserve and make the U.S. a leader in crypto. In February, the SEC dismissed a civil enforcement action against Coinbase. The 2023 case accused Coinbase of acting as an unregistered broker. Coinbase has been developing its institutional platform for hedge funds, corporate investors and registered investment advisors. The platform, called Coinbase Prime, combines custody, staking, trading and financing features. \\ The launch of crypto ETFs in 2024 has fueled momentum in institutional crypto trading. Coinbase has benefitted. The company\u2019s institutional transaction revenues rose to $345 million in 2024 from $90 million in 2023. Coinbase expects further growth in institutional trading. According to the company's 2023 Institutional Investor Digital Assets survey, 64% of crypto investors expect to increase allocations. More than half (57%) of those surveyed without crypto allocations believe they'll allocate to digital currencies in the next three years. Coinbase has several expansion initiatives in process or recently completed: Geographic and feature expansion efforts can attract new customers, improve the versatility of crypto assets and insulate Coinbase from competitors. Year to date, COIN is down 27%. As of March 14, the stock is also down over the last 30-day and five-day periods. Many investors are wary of the volatile tech sector, including crypto stocks, due to concern over President Trump's tariff actions. COIN may not recover until the tariff decisions are final and investors understand the potential consequences. Coinbase reported 2024 results on February 13, 2025. Since then, at least five analysts raised their COIN stock price targets. At least one analyst lowered the price target. The net effect is a consensus 12-month stock price prediction of $327.61. The lowest estimate is $185 and the highest is $475. Average analyst EPS expectations indicate Coinbase's EPS will shrink in 2025, grow moderately in 2026 and 2027 and increase nearly 70% in 2028. Famous tech investor Cathie Wood is bullish on Bitcoin, which implies a positive outlook for Coinbase. Wood\u2019s firm Ark Invest predicts Bitcoin will grow at a compound annual rate of 21% to 58% through 2030. That growth alongside a light regulatory environment should spur increased retail and institutional crypto investing. Ark Invest has purchased more than $33 million of Coinbase stock in multiple transactions since the end of February. Wood favors fast-growing tech stocks. Her minimum return target is 15%. Some analysts predict Coinbase will grow well beyond Wood's minimum threshold. Investortrip.com says COIN stock will reach $1,600 by 2028, with extreme price swings along the way. That equates to a CAGR of 107%. Institutional trading platform Vstar has a more modest COIN price target outlook of $755 by 2030. The downside prediction for COIN involves economic recession in the U.S. If inflation or unemployment rise, investors will likely trim their growth positions\u2014which may include cryptocurrency and Coinbase stock. Coinbase could take a hit on two fronts. Earnings may suffer as crypto trading slows. And, Coinbase's valuation may fall as investors lose faith in the business model amid tough crypto investing conditions. Bottom Line Bullish analysts predict strong growth for Coinbase over the next three years. The driver will primarily be a Bitcoin price surge that promotes retail and institutional trading. Unfortunately, economic uncertainty or recession could easily derail or delay Coinbase\u2019s growth trajectory. For that reason, COIN stock is not for the faint of heart. It is a suitable pick for investors bullish on bitcoin who aren't planning on initiating or adding to their Bitcoin positions.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Business Insider Edition  China has taken aim at another company it's not happy with, sending its share price sliding.          On Thursday, China's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office reposted a commentary from state-owned Ta Kung Pao \u2014 a Hong Kong media outlet \u2014 that criticized Hong Kong's CK Hutchinson for its decision to sell a major stake in two Panama ports to a consortium led by New York-based BlackRock.       CK Hutchison's shares fell as much as 6.7% on Friday morning \u2014 the most since September 2022 \u2014 and were 6.2% lower at 2:58 p.m. local time. Its market value is about $23 billion.               The $22.8 billion deal was announced last week after US President Donald Trump hit out at Chinese influence at the Panama Canal and threatened to regain control over the key shipping waterway.               The news came after another multinational company was caught in the ongoing US-China dispute.               On Thursday, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it had communicated with Walmart over reports that the retail giant had asked suppliers to cut wholesale prices to offset higher US tariffs. A social media account linked to state TV first reported the news and warned that Walmart would face repercussions if the company insisted on squeezing suppliers.               Ta Kung Pao said the Panama deal demonstrates that the US is using \"state power\" to encroach on the legitimate rights and interests of other countries and that it's \"power politics packaged as 'business behavior.'\"               It also criticized CK Hutchinson for being \"spineless\" and \"profit-seeking.\" The deal disregards national interests and \"betrays and sells out all Chinese people,\" according to the commentary.               It advised companies to \"think carefully about what position and side they should stand on.\"               The company did not immediately respond to a Business Insider request for comment.               Founded by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing \u2014 once Asia's richest man, CK Hutchinson said last week its decision was \"purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports.\"               The development demonstrates how private companies and their business dealings are increasingly getting caught in the crosshairs of intensified US-China geopolitical tensions.               Ta Kung Pao said in its commentary that the US would use the port deal for \"political purposes and promote its own political agenda.\"               \"China's shipping and trade here will inevitably be subject to the US,\" it added.               Despite investor concerns over the deal following Tung Ka Pao's commentary, analysts see the deal as positive for CK Hutchinson.               \"It's an astute deal selling to a buyer, ostensibly backed by the Trump administration, at the top of the market, knowing global trade could fall under a new tariff regime,\" wrote David Blennerhassett, an analyst at Quiddity Advisors who publishes on the Smartkarma platform, on Thursday.               He added that he doesn't expect the company to reverse its decision to sell the ports following the commentary.               Analysts at CreditSights wrote last week that not only is CK Hutchinson selling its assets at an attractive price, it's also removing geopolitical risks associated with its Panama ports.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Gold futures posted a new $3,000+ record Friday. U.S. stocks climbed on Friday amid signs the federal government may avert a shutdown, recovering some of the losses suffered during an escalating trade war. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 675 points, or 1.65%, while the S&P 500 increased 2.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 2.6%. Despite the gains, each of the major indexes posted losses for the week. The market upswing comes after Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer announced Thursday night that he plans to vote to keep the government open, signaling that there will almost certainly be enough Democratic votes to advance a House GOP funding bill before a shutdown deadline at the end of the day Friday. The gains offered relief for investors reeling from a market decline set off last week by President Donald Trump's tariffs. On Thursday, the S&P 500 closed down more than 10% since a peak attained last month, meaning the decline officially qualified as a market correction. It marked the index's first correction since October 2023. Gold futures also hit a new record Friday morning, trading at $3,016.30, breaking the $3,000 mark for the first time. Gold is a traditional safe haven investment for times of political and economic tumult. The price has been boosted in recent years as central banks have invested in the commodity as a hedge. Trump on Thursday stood firm on his tariff policy, despite the losses on Wall Street. \"I'm not going to bend at all,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Thursday. When asked whether he would reconsider a fresh round of tariffs set to go into effect on April 2, Trump offered a one-word reply: \"No.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 each closed down more than 1% on Thursday.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team , Contributor.  NVDA Stock   Question: How would you react if you held Nvidia stock (NASDAQ: NVDA) and its value fell by 60% or more in the upcoming months? Although this might seem extreme, such an occurrence has happened before and could repeat itself. Earlier this year, Nvidia stock experienced a sell-off, dropping from approximately $148 in mid-January to around $115 now, which represents a nearly 23% decrease. This decline has been fueled by several factors, such as the introduction of more resource-efficient AI models like China\u2019s DeepSeek and worries that decelerating investments in generative AI might reduce the demand for Nvidia\u2019s GPUs. Additionally, the overall market is undergoing a significant sell-off, spurred by increasing concerns about a U.S. recession following tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on major trading partners. Separately, see Is A New CEO Enough To Get Intel Back On Track? Here\u2019s the point: The key takeaway is that during a downturn, NVDA stock might incur substantial losses. Data from 2022 indicates that NVDA stock lost more than 60% of its value in only a few quarters. Currently, Nvidia stock has decreased from $148 to $115 in roughly two months. This raises the question: could the stock continue its downward trend and reach approximately $60 if a similar situation were to unfold? Naturally, individual stocks are generally more volatile than diversified portfolios. Therefore, if you are looking for growth with reduced volatility, you might consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns of over 91% since its inception. Slowdown in AI Demand: Over the last two years, companies have significantly invested in training AI models, with Nvidia\u2019s GPUs becoming the preferred option due to their performance and efficiency. The short-term outlook remains robust, as tech giants such as Google and Microsoft are increasing capital expenditures for 2025 to expand their AI cloud infrastructures. Nevertheless, demand may eventually taper off. Since AI model training is predominantly a one-time, compute-intensive process, it could eventually decelerate. As models increase in size, incremental performance improvements are anticipated to diminish, and the supply of high-quality training data might become a limiting factor. Consequently, as the demand for training declines, GPU sales could also decrease. Therefore, as discussed in our analysis here on the macro picture, the U.S. economy might enter a downturn, potentially even a recession, which could further affect GPU sales. Because AI investments continue to be unprofitable for most companies, they may be prime candidates for cost-cutting measures during an economic downturn. This situation could significantly impact Nvidia. The transition to more resource-efficient AI models could also affect Nvidia. China\u2019s DeepSeek model, launched in January, attracted attention for prioritizing software-driven optimization instead of relying on hardware, which could potentially reduce the demand for GPUs. The company reports that it spent only $5.5 million to train its V3 model, which is only a fraction of the hundreds of millions that firms such as OpenAI are said to have spent. Since DeepSeek\u2019s model is open source, major tech companies might adopt similar cost-cutting strategies. If this approach is widely implemented, it could further reduce the demand for AI computing power. For further information, see how DeepSeek impacts Nvidia The U.S. government has imposed export control restrictions on most of Nvidia\u2019s latest AI chipset products destined for China, with the exception of the H20 chips, citing national security concerns. Nevertheless, reports indicate that gray market resellers are using entities registered outside of China to purchase servers equipped with Nvidia\u2019s latest products from companies in various countries, including Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. This is particularly concerning as Singapore has emerged as Nvidia\u2019s second-largest market, generating approximately $23 billion in sales in FY\u201925 (around 18% of revenue), compared to only $2.3 billion (8% of revenue) in FY\u201923. Singapore has now initiated an investigation into these potential loopholes. Such developments could potentially affect Nvidia\u2019s overall revenue to some degree. For further details, see how Trump\u2019s tariffs affect Nvidia stock. NVDA stock has experienced a decline that was marginally more severe than that of the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. Are you concerned about how a market crash might affect NVDA stock? Our dashboard How Low Can NVIDIA Stock Go In A Market Crash? provides a detailed analysis of the stock\u2019s performance during and following previous market crashes. \u2022 NVDA stock declined by 62.7% from a peak of $30.12 on 3 January 2022 to $11.23 on 16 October 2022, compared to a 25.4% peak-to-trough drop for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock fully rebounded to its pre-crisis peak by 17 May 2023   \u2022 Since then, it has risen to a high of $149.43 on 6 January 2025 and is currently trading at approximately $115 \u2022 NVDA stock dropped by 37.6% from a high of $7.87 on 19 February 2020 to $4.91 on 16 March 2020, compared to a 33.9% decline for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peak by 11 May 2020 \u2022 NVDA stock declined by 85.1% from a high of $0.99 on 17 October 2007 to $0.15 on 20 November 2008, compared to a 56.8% drop for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock fully rebounded to its pre-crisis peak by 13 May 2016 NVIDIA\u2019s Revenues have soared, increasing at an average rate of 80.1% over the past three years, which is significantly higher than the 6.3% increase in S&P 500 revenues. Nonetheless, Nvidia\u2019s valuation remains attractive given its strong growth, with the stock trading at approximately 26x consensus FY\u201926 earnings. Yet, there are some potential risks. In recent quarters, net margins have exceeded an impressive 50%, propelled by robust pricing power and high demand for AI chips. Still, these margins could be at risk if demand declines or if competition intensifies. A slowdown in demand could result in reduced pricing, lower sales volumes, and a significant decline in profitability. As an aside, check out the large move in this quantum computing stock in What\u2019s Happening With QBTS Stock? Considering the potential for a slowdown in growth and broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself this question: Will you continue holding your NVDA stock, or will you panic and sell if it starts falling to $70, $60, or even lower prices?

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team , Contributor.  CHONGQING, CHINA - MARCH 10: In this photo illustration, the D-Wave logo is displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen, with the company's latest stock market performance and candlestick charts visible in the background, highlighting D-Wave's real-time financial trends, stock price fluctuations, market volatility, and investment developments within the quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and technology sectors, on March 10, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin\/Getty Images)   D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) has seen its stock price nearly double this week following its quarterly earnings report. While the company reported a loss of eight cents per share on sales of $2.3 million, slightly missing analyst expectations, investors were notably enthusiastic about the company's forward guidance. The quantum computing company\u2019s Q1 outlook dramatically exceeded expectations, with projected sales of $10 million compared to analyst consensus estimates of just $2.3 million. Additionally, D-Wave\u2019s Q4 bookings showed remarkable growth, surging 502% to $18.3 million. Furthermore, the company reported achieving quantum computational supremacy on a practical, real-world problem, surpassing classical computation. Separately, see \u2013 Adobe Stock To $200? D-Wave's technology focuses on quantum annealing systems designed to solve complex optimization problems. Unlike traditional computers that use binary bits (limited to values of either 0 or 1), quantum computers utilize qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This fundamental difference allows quantum computers to process vast amounts of data and explore numerous potential solutions concurrently, offering computational capabilities that are fundamentally different from conventional systems. While breakthrough technologies like quantum computing offer exciting potential, they often come with significant market volatility. For investors seeking substantial upside with more stability than individual stocks provide, the High-Quality portfolio presents an attractive alternative. This portfolio has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 and has delivered impressive returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Recent developments in the quantum computing sector have contributed to broader market enthusiasm. Microsoft recently entered the competitive quantum computing landscape by unveiling a new chip. This development follows similar advancements from other tech giants, including Google\u2019s Willow chip, Amazon\u2019s Quantum Embark program, and IBM\u2019s Condor processor. Microsoft has indicated that the timeline for practical quantum computing might be shorter than previously anticipated. Furthermore, D-Wave\u2019s - although trivial, but increasing order book - reinforces the notion that the quantum field is progressing positively. D-Wave\u2019s business model centers on its Quantum Computing as a Service (QCaaS) offerings. The company provides access to its cutting-edge quantum systems through multiple channels, including a cloud service platform. These services enable clients to leverage quantum computing capabilities without the need for direct hardware investment or specialized expertise. Despite quantum computing\u2019s impressive theoretical promise, the technology remains largely developmental and not yet mature enough for broad industrial application. D-Wave\u2019s financial situation reflects this early-stage reality, with a modest revenue base of just $8.8 million and bookings of $23.9 million in 2024. D-Wave\u2019s bullish first-quarter forecast stems largely from its collaboration with the Julich Supercomputing Centre, which will acquire a D-Wave Advantage annealing quantum computing system. Like most quantum computing investments, QBTS represents a high-risk, high-growth opportunity influenced by numerous variables including technological advancement trajectories and cost structures. While D-Wave could potentially increase its sales in coming years, potentially driving further stock appreciation, significant challenges persist. Most notably, the company reported substantial EBITDA loss of $56 million last year. For investors, D-Wave essentially represents a speculative bet on both the future commercial viability of quantum computing technology and the company\u2019s ability to establish itself as a leading provider within this emerging field. Investment decisions should weigh the considerable long-term potential against the substantial near-term financial challenges and technological uncertainties. Not too happy about the volatile nature of quantum stocks? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that?

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk took a leaf out of President Donald Trump's book last month, turning to a controversial entrepreneur for support as he pushed for deregulation to help boost the economy. Presenting his government's economic plan in February, Tusk hailed \"the moment when we can overtake everyone.\" \"The light is visible from Poland,\" he said. \"A breakthrough year means investment, investment, and yet more investment.\" Tusk also took the opportunity to announce measures to deregulate the economy, calling on the eccentric Polish businessman Rafa\u0142 Brzoska to help. \"Do you accept?\" Tusk publicly asked the billionaire. Brzoska \u2014 the founder of the parcel locker business InPost, and one of Poland's richest people \u2014 accepted Tusk's challenge, emphasizing that he had no political aspirations but that he intended to present 300 recommendations by June 1. Poland is already one of the fastest-growing economies in Europe. Some experts say exports, consumer behavior, and a well-trained, flexible labor force are the key drivers behind its growth. For others, however, it's the Polish \"entrepreneurial gene.\" This so-called \"entrepreneurial gene\" was on full display in 2024, with more than 353,000 new businesses launched in Poland. The country is also one of Europe's hardest-working nations based on average hours worked per week. Polish workers are \"above all, hard-working, well-educated and highly qualified,\" Krzysztof Inglot, a labor market expert, said, adding that they often rise quickly through company ranks. He said this had a lot to do with what he called the \"entrepreneurial gene,\" which he said had been carved out under the years of communist rule. \"We jokingly say that Poles are entrepreneurial, that construction workers will always try to find an easier solution to a situation. This is what makes us different from other nations, who often work according to standardized and identical rules. In contrast, we still have this tendency to look for alternative solutions and simplifications,\" Inglot continued. Marcin Wojew\u00f3dka, an expert in labor law and the president of the Pension Institute, agreed, saying Poles could \"move mountains\" when motivated and able to see the \"quick effects of our actions.\" \"This is not about the proverbial Polish plumber in Western Europe, but precisely about courage and the willingness to take risks if the reward is attractive enough. Poles, perhaps due to the historical experience of our ancestors, are able to grit their teeth, focus on the task at hand, and often even take shortcuts to achieve the desired result,\" he said. One such entrepreneur is Kamil Hagemajer, who runs a chain of milk bars in Warsaw, the Polish capital, and Wroclaw, in western Poland. Known as a \"bar mleczny\" in Polish, a milk bar is a low-cost caf\u00e9 that dates back to the communist era. \"We currently have 20 bars and employ about 200 people,\" Hagemajer said, adding that he believed the entrepreneurial gene was the Poles' \"dominant trait.\" \"You could see it in the communist years when the first businesses were born in markets or when people took small cars to transport sweaters or jeans from other countries and sell them in Poland as there were no such products in our country.\" Looking ahead, Hagemajer said Polish business owners were ready to embrace modern technology to work more efficiently but that they still faced administrative and tax obstacles. \"This means that we have to rely on the knowledge of external companies, which often means that we lose authority over our businesses,\" he said. According to some forecasts, Poland's GDP growth will hit 3.5% this year, up from 2.9% in 2024. By comparison, the German economy is expected to grow by 0.2% this year \u2014 according to a January forecast from the German Central Bank. \"Poland is developing faster than Western European countries, and we can count on one hand the years when this was not the case. For various reasons, it is easier for less developed countries to grow quickly and thus catch up in terms of their development,\" Piotr Bartkiewicz, an economist at Bank Pekao, said. A large part of the German economy has been focused on the production of traditional combustion-engine vehicles. But strong competition from China and other countries has led to a slump in car sales. High taxes, bureaucracy, and rapidly rising labor costs have compounded the issue, with the German economy not seeing significant growth in five years. Such issues have potential knock-on effects for Poland. \"Germany is our largest trading partner, accounting for 27% of Polish exports. Exports to the next countries on the list are over four times less. Therefore, German stagnation is a serious problem for exporters, even if they increase their market share in other countries and look for new sales markets,\" Grzegorz Ogonek, an economist at Santander Bank Polska, said. Poland is also facing the potential impacts of an aging population \u2014 something the country's Minister for Senior Policy, Marzena Ok\u0142a-Drewnowicz, said would be \"a great challenge\" moving forward. \"We need to be open to new technologies. The labor resources in Poland are steadily shrinking, despite an influx of immigrants, which does not help economic growth,\" Ogonek added. Despite such headwinds, the Polish economy has kept growing, with economists pointing to three key driving forces. Firstly, Polish exporters are finding new niches in foreign markets and are competitive despite increasing labor costs and the strengthening of the Polish zloty (PLN). \"The EU is, of course, the largest market for Poland, but not the only one. In the macroeconomic data, we see an increase in exports to other markets, such as Asia, the Middle East, or North America. Polish exports are also diversified and cover a wide range of products, including food products,\" Bartkiewicz said. Polish consumers were also less affected by the energy crisis and increased inflation. Despite relatively high inflation, the decline in real household income in Poland was one of the smallest in the EU due to fiscal stimulation and high wage growth. As a result, there was a moderate decline in private consumer spending, as well as a faster return to growth and more regular consumer patterns \u2014 a process that is only just beginning in other parts of Europe. Thirdly, relatively high public investments (financed, among other sources, by EU funds) have been an additional catalyst. \"This last factor will be crucial in 2025,\" Bartkiewicz said. It is this balance between exports, domestic consumption, and investments financed by EU funds that seems to be allowing the Polish economy to grow. \"Regardless of what is happening in the global economy, one branch of our economy is always working,\" said Marcin Klucznik, senior advisor in the global economy team at the Polish Economic Institute.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Stocks rebounded Friday following days of declines that pushed the S&P 500 into correction territory after Senate Democrats opted not to block a stopgap government funding bill, easing one uncertainty. Additionally, President Donald Trump didn\u2019t escalate his trade war today. The S&P 500 closed up 2.1%, with the Nasdaq Composite climbing 2.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average advancing 674 points, or 1.65%. The Magnificent 7 tech stocks all gained. A much-worse-than-expected consumer confidence reading from the University of Michigan only briefly dented gains. The markets, which have been slammed by President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff plans, got a boost after progress was made by Congress to avoid a government shutdown. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said he would vote to keep the government open, carving a path for members of his party to join Republicans and pass a six-month spending bill ahead of a looming Friday deadline. \u201cYou have to make these decisions based on what is best for not only your party but your country,\u201d Schumer told reporters.  The S&P 500 index had fallen more than 10% from its recent peak, officially entering correction territory on Thursday. It was the fastest shift to a correction since the six trading days at the start of the Covid pandemic in March 2020, according to Barron\u2019s. Both the Nasdaq and the Dow have fallen about 4% over the past few days.  \u201cWe aren\u2019t too surprised about the volatility of this magnitude,\u201d said Mike Reynolds, Glenmede\u2019s VP for investment strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the tariffs themselves that have been proposed, it\u2019s that uncertainty that there could be additional levies just around the corner.\u201d The Trump administration may deal another blow next month when it imposes \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, as these are likely to fall on countries including Vietnam, India, and Indonesia that are alternatives to China as sources of low-cost goods, Reynolds told Quartz.

Nearly four years have passed, and in that time, competition has arrived from new corners of the creator market.\u00a0 Cricut's response is the new Maker 4, and its sole improvement is faster cutting for everything that isn't made by Cricut for the same price as its predecessor.\u00a0 Where the Cricut Explore series sits as a budget-friendly cutting machine ideal for the most popular uses of these machines, the Cricut Maker series is designed to be limited only by your imagination. It supports over 300 materials, allowing you to do anything from making your own puzzles out of chipboard or basswood to custom leather jewelry, in addition to everything the Explore series is capable of. Its versatility is what made the Explore 3 such a great option in 2021, because you could have one machine that didn't take up a ton of room and could do more than just about anything else on the market.\u00a0 Today, the Maker 4 isn't really competing with traditional cutting machines from Silhouette or Brother and the cutting machines made by those companies. Over the last couple of years, the biggest competition has been coming from companies like xTool and Glowforge. Both companies have released laser cutting and engraving machines designed to offer more than you can do with a Cricut, at much lower prices than previous generations. The Glowforge Aura and Spark can cut stickers and make iron-on designs or cut PVC-based vinyl for whatever you need. The same is true of the xTool F1 Lite, and all three of these machines are $800 or less.If you have used the Cricut Maker 3, you have also used the Cricut Maker 4. Aside from being available in different colors, the outer shell and inner tool kits are nearly identical. All of my accessories for the Maker 3 immediately connected and worked with the Maker 4, which is nice if you've already spent the money on additional cutting tools or spools for holding big rolls of vinyl. It took me no time at all to \"move in\" to this new version, in fact I went from opening the box at 3:30 p.m. to having a silly fake label to put on a bottle of hot sauce I was giving a friend at 4:15 because it felt so familiar.\u00a0 Like the new Explore 4, the Maker 4 is noticeably faster than its predecessor when cutting anything that isn't a part of Cricut's Smart Materials line. It can handle multiple projects on the same mat, allowing a small business or skilled home crafter to spend less time waiting. A speed improvement like this can be a big deal for anyone with limited time, and when combined with support for cutting mats that are twice as long as the standard square mat, it's a great way to improve your existing creative process.\u00a0 This Cricut Maker 4 did not arrive properly calibrated, requiring the user to go through the lengthy process before being able to use any of the print and cut functionality.\u00a0 That improved cutting speed is incredibly valuable, but it is met with a lot of the same limitations Cricut has always had. The ability to print something and cut it precisely, for example, still requires a lengthy manual calibration process despite having an optical sensor for detecting the edges of your design. And if you're using the print and cut feature, especially for stickers, the cutting part is the only part that is faster. Detecting the edges of the design is still the longest part of that process, though Cricut is working on a new algorithm set to be released in the coming months to improve this process.\u00a0While the improved speed when cutting vinyl, paper and iron-on materials is a fantastic move forward, especially with materials not made or controlled by Cricut, that same speed improvement is still pretty slow on thicker or more complex materials. It still takes a while to make a puzzle or cut leather, especially compared with Cricut's new competitors. A silly label I made for a bottle of hot sauce using the Cricut Maker 4. If you have only enough room in your home for a single machine to do as much as possible, I'm not sure Cricut's Maker 4 is the best option in 2025. If you really love using Cricut for cutting vinyl and making iron-ons or stickers, the Explore 4 is only $250 and will work as fast as the Maker 4. If you aspire to make more than the things Cricut does best, the $400 price tag for this new machine is a big ask when the price of the competition is so much lower than it was even two years ago.\u00a0","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Business Insider Edition  Canadians are pulling back on travel to the US amid a scrap between the two nations over tariffs first imposed by President Donald Trump.          According to Statistics Canada data released Monday, the number of Canadians driving to the US fell 23% in February compared with the same month last year, marking the second consecutive monthly decline and the second decline observed since March 2021.               Leisure bookings are also taking a hit. Flight Centre Travel Group, a major travel agency in Canada, told Business Insider it saw a 40% decrease in leisure bookings to the US in February year over year.               \"While Canadians remain eager to travel, they are increasingly shifting their focus to destinations outside the US,\"Amra Durakovic, a spokesperson for Flight Centre Travel Group Canada, told BI.               The downturn follows a call from outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \u2014 who's set to be replaced by Mark Carney on Friday \u2014 for Canadian citizens to reconsider visiting the US and instead support domestic tourism.               His comments came in response to Trump issuing executive orders on February 1 to levy 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico.               One online survey suggested that Trudeau's message was resonating. In a Leger survey of about 1,500 Canadians, nearly half said they were less likely to visit the US this year compared with last year, while six in 10 said they planned to vacation in Canada instead.               \"The drop in Canadian visits is closely linked to the US tariffs imposed on February 1,\" Rachel J.C. Fu, the director of the University of Florida'sEric Friedheim Tourism Institute, told BI.               \"The 25% tariffs likely increased economic tension between the two countries, influencing Canadian consumer sentiment and travel choices,\" she said, adding that Trudeau's comments further discouraged travel to the US.               A drop in Canadian visitors could come at a cost to the US economy.               Last month, the US Travel Association estimated that a 10% decrease in Canadian travel could result in $2.1 billion in lost spending and 14,000 job losses, with Florida, California, Nevada, New York, and Texas \u2014 Canadian tourists' top US destinations \u2014 most affected.               While the US travel and tourism industry is projected to generate $223.64 billion in 2025, losses could exceed current estimates if tensions persist, Adam Sacks, the president of Tourism Economics, told BI.               \"Canada is the US top visitor market, so the stakes are high,\" he added.               Tony Poletti, the owner of the family-runMarketside Restaurant\u00a0in Niagara Falls, New York \u2014 which sits on the border with Canada \u2014 told BI: \"It's just a matter of time before we feel the impact of it.\"               \"It's going to have a bigger impact on businesses in Niagara County than people could imagine,\" he added.               Poletti, whose family has run the restaurant since 1939, said his \"very dedicated\" Canadian customer base had already expressed reluctance to travel to the US.               One longtime Canadian client told him her husband refused to let her visit because he was \"very upset\" by Trump's tariffs.               \"What Washington is doing is they're cutting off their nose to spite their face,\" he said, adding: \"It's not going to be long before it's going to hurt Americans.\"               Economic uncertainty has already rattled financial markets this week.               Wall Street plunged on Monday after Trump refused to rule out a recession, saying in a Sunday interview on Fox News that the US was in \"a period of transition.\"               Stocks slid again Tuesday after Trump wrote on Truth Social that he instructed his commerce secretary to place an additional 25% tariff on steel and aluminum coming from Canada into the US, bringing the tariff rate on those imports to 50%.               He later backtracked, with his trade advisor, Peter Navarro, telling CNBC on Tuesday afternoon that the 50% tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum would no longer go into effect on Wednesday.               Markets continued to slide Thursday, with the S&P 500 entering a correction.               Fu said that if the tariffs remained in place and continued to strain economic relations, the Canadian travel slump \"could last for months or even two more years. \"               \"Unless the trade dispute is resolved or new incentives encourage Canadian travelers to return, the US tourism industry may need to prepare for a prolonged downturn in Canadian visitors,\" she added.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Business Insider Edition  As the backlash against Elon Musk grows, the US has joined the long list of places where Tesla's sales are plummeting.          New Tesla registrations in the US fell 11% in January from a year earlier, according to data from S&P Global Mobility \u2014 even as the company's EV rivals surged.               Ford's electric vehicle registrations rose 54% from a year earlier, while other legacy carmakers such as Chevrolet and VW also saw big jumps in sales.               Tesla remains the dominant player in the US market, accounting for 42% of total EV sales and selling 35,000 more EVs than second-place Ford in the first month of the year.               But the automaker is facing a difficult period as sales slump worldwide\u00a0and the\u00a0backlash against Musk, its CEO, builds.       Tesla's European sales almost halved in January, with Musk being heavily criticized across the continent for his attacks on European leaders and endorsement of the German far-right party AfD.               The billionaire's work cutting the federal workforce with the White House DOGE office has also sparked protests across the US, and Tesla has become a target.               The \"Tesla Takedown\" movement has held protests outside the company's showrooms in multiple US cities, and the discontent over Musk's actions has pushed some Tesla owners to sell up.               In some states, Tesla vehicles and dealerships have also been hit by vandalism and arson. In Oregon, the police are investigating after a dealership in a Portland suburb was hit with gunfire for the second time in a week.               In China, meanwhile, sales of Teslas manufactured in the country fell by 49% in February, according to industry data, as local EV rivals such as BYD continue to put the US automaker under serious pressure.               Tesla's share price has dropped by more than 50% since mid-December, with investors expressing concern over the worrying sales figures and the amount of time Musk is spending working on DOGE.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team , Contributor.  PFE Stock Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) has faced significant challenges in recent years, with the stock losing half its value since late 2021 as COVID-19 vaccine demand waned. The pharmaceutical giant has struggled to develop new blockbuster drugs to compensate for declining vaccine revenues, raising investor concerns.   However, the company has taken strategic steps to enhance profitability and stimulate growth, including the acquisition of Seagen to bolster its product pipeline. These efforts may position Pfizer favorably in the current market environment. Separately, why did Adobe stock drop? See Adobe Stock To $200? As the Trump administration\u2019s tariff policies create market uncertainty, with the S&P 500 down 6% this year, investors are increasingly seeking safer investments. Our take on market crash risk right now has more details on tariffs and its impact on the broader market. Now, the healthcare sector has demonstrated remarkable resilience, with the S&P Healthcare index posting a 4% gain during the same period. Pfizer stock appears particularly well-positioned in this climate of volatility. Having already undergone a substantial correction, PFE shares offer potential value. Additionally, the company has historically outperformed during market downturns, making it a potentially attractive option for investors navigating the current economic uncertainty. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. We think that PFE stock looks risky - but a good pick to buy at its current price of around $26. We believe there are a couple of concerns with PFE stock, which makes it risky despite its current valuation being moderate.   We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of PFE stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Pfizer along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a moderate operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below.  Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, PFE stock is currently valued in line with the broader market. \u2022 Pfizer has a price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 2.4 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500   \u2022 Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P\/EBIT) ratio is 10.0 compared to 24.3 for S&P 500   \u2022 And, it has a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 11.8 vs. the benchmark\u2019s 24.3 Pfizer's Revenues have seen some growth over recent years. \u2022 Pfizer has seen its top line shrink at an average rate of 3.3% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.3% for S&P 500)   \u2022 Its revenues have grown 6.8% from $60 Bil to $64 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500)   \u2022 Also, its quarterly revenues grew 21.9% to $18 Bil in the most recent quarter from $15 Bil a year ago (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500) Pfizer's profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. \u2022 Pfizer's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $15 Bil, which represents a high Operating Margin of 23.5% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500)   \u2022 Pfizer's Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $13 Bil, pointing to a high OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 20.0% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500) Pfizer's balance sheet looks weak. \u2022 Pfizer's Debt figure was $64 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $145 Bil (as of 3\/13\/2025). This implies a poor Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 42.5% (vs. 19.0% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable]   \u2022 Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $20 Bil of the $213 Bil in Total Assets for Pfizer. This yields a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 9.6% (vs. 14.8% for S&P 500) PFE stock has fared better than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on PFE stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. \u2022 PFE stock fell 26.4% from a high of $56.69 on 11 January 2022 to $41.75 on 10 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock is yet to recover to its pre-Crisis high   \u2022 The highest the stock has reached since then is $54.48 on 14 December 2022 and it currently trades at around $26 \u2022 PFE stock fell 21.7% from a high of $36.40 on 4 March 2020 to $28.49 on 23 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 14 April 2020 \u2022 PFE stock fell 54.3% from a high of $25.54 on 10 October 2007 to $11.66 on 2 March 2009, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 15 October 2012 In summary, Pfizer's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: \u2022 Growth: Strong   \u2022 Profitability: Very Strong   \u2022 Financial Stability: Weak   \u2022 Downturn Resilience: Good   \u2022 Overall: Strong Although PFE stock presents a degree of risk due to its moderate valuation, our analysis indicates it remains a favorable buy. We estimate Pfizer\u2019s valuation to be around $36 per share, reflecting over 35% upside from its current levels. While PFE stock looks promising, investing in a single stock can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team , Contributor.  ADBE Stock Adobe (NASDAQ; ADBE) recently announced its fiscal first quarter results for the period ending February 2025, reporting earnings of $5.08 per share on revenues of $5.71 billion. This represents a 10% year-over-year increase in sales and 13% growth in earnings. The company fared better than the Wall Street expectations, which had projected earnings of $4.97 per share on sales of $5.66 billion. Separately, in an uncertain environment, will drug stocks be defensive? See Should You Buy Pfizer Stock At $26? Despite exceeding analyst estimates, Adobe\u2019s stock plunged 14% on Thursday, March 13. This can partly be attributed to an underwhelming outlook for the current quarter. Adobe projects $4.98 earnings per share on sales of $5.8 billion (at the mid-point of the guidance), slightly missing the consensus estimates of $5.00 earnings per share on sales of $5.8 billion. The company\u2019s remaining performance obligations\u2014a key indicator of future business\u2014grew by 12% to $19.7 billion. Lately, investors have been worried about slower than expected growth in generative AI for Adobe. The company reported $125 million in AI annualized recurring revenue and forecasts that number to double within the current fiscal year. Beyond the impact of earnings, this is a concerning period for the broader markets, which creates additional challenges for Adobe. The growing economic concerns in the United States, sparked by President Trump\u2019s implementation of tariffs, are fostering an unfavorable climate for markets in general. Adobe stock is unlikely to remain immune to these conditions. In fact, we think that ADBE stock could decline to as low as $200 per share. Here\u2019s the thing, in a downturn, ADBE can lose \u2013 no \u2013 there is evidence, from the recent economic downturns, that ADBE stock lost as much as 65% of its value over a span of just a few quarters. Now, of course, individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio \u2013 and in this environment if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. While the continued growth in Adobe\u2019s subscription business is commendable, substantial macroeconomic headwinds warrant attention. Though inflation concerns have diminished, they haven't disappeared. The current administration's aggressive tariff and immigration policies have rekindled inflation anxieties, potentially signaling economic turbulence ahead. The heightened geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the new administration's bold policy initiatives presents additional challenges. With ongoing conflicts in Ukraine-Russia, trade uncertainties, and strained negotiations with long-standing allies including Canada, Mexico, and Europe, the risk landscape has grown increasingly complex. Notably, ADBE stock has seen an impact worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns \u2014a critical consideration for investors evaluating their risk tolerance in today\u2019s volatile environment. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. \u2022 ADBE stock fell 51.2% from a high of $564.37 on 3 January 2022 to $275.20 on 2 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 5 September 2023   \u2022 Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $634.76 on 4 February 2024 and currently trades at around $380 \u2022 ADBE stock fell 25.6% from a high of $383.28 on 19 February 2020 to $285.00 on 12 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 May 2020 \u2022 ADBE stock fell 66.7% from a high of $48.00 on 24 October 2007 to $15.98 on 3 March 2009, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 12 July 2013 Adobe\u2019s stock has declined 15% year-to-date, reflecting investor concerns about the company\u2019s position in the generative AI space. This downward trend could potentially continue with the macroeconomic uncertainty. Surely, Adobe has demonstrated strong revenue growth, averaging 10.9% over the past three years\u2014outpacing the S&P 500's 6.3% growth rate during the same period. However, the stock continues to command a premium valuation with a price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 9.0, substantially higher than the S&P 500's P\/S ratio of 3.2. So ask yourself the question: if you want to hold on to your ADBE stock, will you panic and sell if it starts dropping to $250 or even lower levels? Holding on to a falling stock is not always easy.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"ByBrendan Ahern  ByBrendan Ahern , Senior Contributor.  CLN Asian equities were mostly higher overnight as Hong Kong and Mainland China outperformed while Indonesia and Korea underperformed. China\u2019s markets went risk on overnight as nearly all sectors closed higher in both Mainland China and Hong Kong. Key catalysts were optimism around potential policy moves following the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC). Leaders will hold a key press conference on Monday. In the cards for policy include rate cuts, PBOC-led consumer-focused loans, and the further extension of the successful trade-in subsidies. OpenAI came out with a letter to the US government saying that DeepSeek is a threat to the US\u2019 lead in AI. The letter also suggested that the company\u2019s models could pose an additional risk of manipulating information seen by Americans. I am not sure what the government, under the current administration, would do to address this. They already prevented the ban of TikTok. Live streaming and gaming platform Douyu reported Q4 earnings overnight. The company is not currently profitable, and revenue and net income decreased in an ultra-competitive market. However, they were able to increase users by +6% year-over-year. This week, the Hong Kong-listed shares of KE Holdings, or \u201cBeike,\u201d a popular online real estate platform, were added to the Stock Connect program, which will allow the shares to be traded by Mainland investors. China\u2019s deflation in February highlights how ambitious the targets laid out by leaders at the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC), which concluded on Monday. The most important targets are GDP growth of 5% and Inflation of 2%. Consumers are still reluctant to spend, but it has been proven that targeted policies can be successful, as seen with the trade-in subsidies. Going forward, supporting the private sector, especially technology, and asset prices, especially real estate, in addition to consumer subsidies, are needed to achieve these goals. With inflation, the cost of imports could play a large role as China hits back at the US with retaliatory tariffs. However, consumers in China do not consume imports as much as they do in the US and European Union. In fact, the level of imported goods consumed and the perceived value of imported goods have both come down significantly in recent years. So, bringing inflation up will be challenging and will require internal demand for internal goods and services to rise substantially. Chart The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes both closed higher by +2.12% and +2.31%, respectively, on volume that increased +24% from yesterday.

Once Ballmer came aboard in 1980, he \"became the 24-hour-a-day partner I needed,\" Gates wrote.               Ballmer was later succeeded by Satya Nadella, who has held the role since taking over in 2014.               Gates says his fears were unfounded in hindsight since Ballmer \"took us to new heights\" and Nadella has done well at \"navigating what even today remains one of the most complex CEO jobs in the world.\"               The company has notched several important milestones since Gates departed as CEO.               Its market cap has grown substantially, hitting a record $3 trillion dollars late last year. The company released the first Xbox in 2001 and has snapped up video game makers Mojang and Activision Blizzard. It also acquired companies like GitHub and LinkedIn. In recent years, it's poured billions into a partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI.               \"It makes me feel so good that I get to just come in and play a very bit role of doing product reviews, learning about AI, you know, getting some help from Microsoft on the work that I'm doing,\" Gates added. \"And it's allowed me, you know, to throw everything in and to have the incredible resources that my Microsoft ownership created.\"               While Gates stepped down as CEO in 2000, he continued to serve on the company's board of directors until 2020, when he stepped down following allegations that he had behaved inappropriately toward female employees.               He has spent much of his time since on the philanthropic foundation he started with his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates.               BI's Ashley Stewart reported last year that Gates remains \"intimately involved in the company's operations\" behind the scenes, reviewing products, advising on strategy, and recruiting top executives.               Frank Shaw, a Microsoft spokesperson, told BI at the time that Gates' role as a technical advisor, which he began in 2014, hadn't substantially changed since he vacated his board seat.               The \"insistence on portraying the role of Bill Gates as 'pulling strings' at Microsoft,\" Shaw told BI at the time, \"is fundamentally inaccurate and at odds with reality.\"               \"With respect to Microsoft, stepping down from the board in no way means stepping away from the company,\" Gates wrote in 2020 about the move. \"Microsoft will always be an important part of my life's work and I will continue to be engaged with Satya and the technical leadership to help shape the vision and achieve the company's ambitious goals.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Business Insider Edition  An Australian billionaire known for his efforts to combat the climate crisis has defended buying a private jet.  Mike Cannon-Brookes, the CEO of software firm Atlassian and a minority owner of Utah Jazz, explained his purchase in a Thursday LinkedIn post.               \"I'm not denying I have a deep internal conflict on this,\" he wrote.               Cannon-Brookes said personal security was the primary reason, as well as time management. The 45-year-old said owning a private jet would let him \"run a global business from Australia, and still be a constantly present dad.\"               Time constraints are often cited as a key motivator for flying private, as passengers aren't bound by scheduled flight times and don't need to spend much time waiting at airports.               As Jimmy Caroll of the luxury travel firm Pelorus said at a media event last year: \"No matter how hard you work and how much money you have, you cannot buy more time.\"               Atlassian, Cannon-Brookes' firm, has a market cap of $54 billion \u2014 giving the CEO a net worth of $12.5 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.               He has invested chunks of his wealth in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.               Cannon-Brookes is the biggest shareholder in AGL Energy, Australia's largest electricity generator, and convinced the company to close its coal-fired power plants a decade earlier than planned.               He has also pledged to donate and invest 1.5 billion Australian dollars ($945 million) on climate projects by 2030.               \"Although private aviation is far from a big contributor to global emissions, it is a carbon-intensive way to travel,\" Cannon-Brookes wrote on LinkedIn.               Aviation as a whole accounts for 2% of the world's CO2 emissions.               The billionaire said he has \"an extremely rigorous carbon regime for all my flying,\" referencing \"direct air capture and sustainable fuels.\"               \"These options aren't practical for commercial flights \u2014 but are viable privately,\" he added.       Sustainable aviation fuel is one of the ways the industry is trying to reduce its carbon impact. While airlines like Virgin Atlantic and Emirates have operated flights using it, it is expensive and challenging to acquire on a mass scale.               Australian media reported that Cannon-Brookes bought a Bombardier Global 7500 \u2014 which typically costs around $75 million.               It has a maximum range of 8,860 miles and a top cruise speed of Mach 0.925 \u2014 capable of connecting New York and Los Angeles in three and a half hours. It can seat up to 19 passengers.       The Global 7500's largest operator, charter firm VistaJet, offers amenities like a double bed. However, the layout and features of Cannon-Brookes' jet are unclear.               \"My commitment to climate is as strong as ever,\" Cannon-Brookes said. \"I'm still pretty damn focused on making an impact at a large scale, removing huge volumes of emissions through active investments and philanthropy.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Business Insider Edition  One million dollars can buy a lot of real estate.          In Miami, you can get a two-bedroom home with a balcony overlooking Biscayne Bay. In Dallas, seven figures can easily purchase a house with over 3,000 square feet.               At 80 Clarkson Street in New York City, though, it'll get you a 155-square-foot room to store your wine \u2014 and that's after you've bought one of the condos upstairs, which start at $6.75 million.               80 Clarkson \u2014 a two-towered luxury building under construction in Manhattan's West Village set to have a squash court, Pilates center, and spa with hot and cold plunge pools \u2014 has revealed pricing for some of its apartments and amenities. The juicy details come from the offering plan, a disclosure document that developers are required to file with the state's attorney general.               The initial pricing for the first 26 units \u2014 out of a total of 112 \u2014 starts at $6.75 million for a two-bedroom with about 1,900 square feet and goes as high as $63 million for a five-bedroom with almost 7,000 square feet.               The most striking sums, however, are for the amenities: on-site wine cellars and parking spots.               While the cheapest of the 48 wine cellars for sale to homeowners starts at $40,000, the two most expensive units veer into the six figures. The most expensive cellar, with approximately 155 square feet, is listed for $1 million in the offering plan, while the second-most expensive, at 107 square feet, is priced at $750,000.               Other New York City buildings have offered homeowners the option to purchase wine cellars. As of February 2023, 180 East 88th Street on the Upper East Side had a 70-plus-bottle wine locker for $15,000, while 100 Barclay in Tribeca had 54 lockers that could hold about more than 100 bottles for $20,000, according to the New York Times.       Jonathan Miller \u2014 the cofounder of real-estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel who has analyzed New York City listing and sales data since the 1980s\u2014 told Business Insider that 80 Clarkson's wine cellar is the most expensive that he can recall.               Real-estate developers try to get more bang for their buck by making every square inch of the building available to buy, Miller added.               \"Over the 15 or 20 years, there has been much more emphasis on monetizing every square inch of a building,\" he said. \"The developer only has one chance, so any unused space is marketed.\"               The developers of 80 Clarkson are Zeckendorf Development and Atlas Capital Group with the Baupost Group. According to pro-development real-estate site New York YiIMBY, 80 Clarkson will cost $1.25 billion to build.               The parking spots at 80 Clarkson, while expensive, aren't record-setting. The building's 105 spots are going for $750,000 apiece. Around 2015, the priciest parking spaces in New York City were approaching $1 million.               80 Clarkson is currently on track for completion in December 2026.

minute issues requiring reworking to fix. \u00a0The ad clearly said \u201ccoming in a future update\u201d. \u00a0Apple never said that was currently possible with the public version of Siri, they said it will eventually be possible with a future software update, and there is absolutely no reason to believe that isn\u2019t still the case\u2026 \u00a0Apple says they anticipate rolling out the features within the next year. \u00a0Now that they\u2019re done whining about how bad the iPhone 16e supposedly is because it doesn\u2019t have MagSafe, these tech writers need a new artificial scandal to whine about. \u00a0And so they\u2019ve turned a simple delay of feature rollout into claims of Apple \u201clying\u201d, \u201cmisleading\u201d, claiming the features \u201cnever existed\u201d, were \u201cnever under development\u201d, etc., when there\u2019s zero evidence for any of those claims, and zero reason to believe them\u2026 \u00a0We actually have many good reasons to believe Apple is developing these features, and simply ran into last minute issues that will require a delay. \u00a0For one, Gurman cited internal sources numerous times about the features when saying they would release in 18.4, and then later when he said they were potentially looking at a delay to 18.5. \u00a0I\u2019m really getting sick and tired of tech writers making claims like this with absolutely zero evidence. \u00a0It\u2019s wrong to falsely accuse companies and\/or people of \u201clying\u201d and such when there is absolutely no evidence to support those accusations.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Price pegged between $399 and $499, with up to 8 million consoles in stock at launch by  Oli Welsh Speaking to Bloomberg, game industry analysts have predicted that the Nintendo Switch 2 will enjoy the biggest console launch ever, despite costing at least $399 \u2014 and maybe as much as $499. Citing a group of analysts \u201cwho regularly communicate with [Nintendo] and its software and hardware partners,\u201d Bloomberg said expectations within the industry and investment communities were sky-high for the launch of Nintendo\u2019s new console. One analyst, Robin Zhu of Sanford C. Bernstein, said he expected the console to launch in June, which is consistent with other reports and with Polygon\u2019s own reckoning, based on the rollout for the first Switch. Zhu said he expected Nintendo to have an astonishing 6 million to 8 million Switch 2 units ready for the launch of the device. This tallies with earlier reports that Nintendo delayed the console\u2019s launch into 2025 to build up stock, and Nintendo\u2019s own comments that it planned to do everything it could to head off scalping and reselling at launch. Nevertheless, it\u2019s an unprecedented figure \u2014 and if true, it would almost certainly lead to a record-breaking launch for the machine. Nintendo sold 2.7 million units of the Switch in its first month, while Sony sold 4.5 million PlayStation 5 consoles in its first quarter. Analyst Serkan Toto predicted sales will also be driven by a strong software lineup with solid day-one third-party support. \u201cThey will sell boatloads of Switch 2 in the first months in particular, almost regardless of the price,\u201d Toto said. On price, the analysts Bloomberg spoke to are unanimous in expecting the Switch 2 to cost at least $399 \u2014 which, again, agrees with Polygon\u2019s own analysis. Some think it could go higher, to $449 or even $499, driven by the cost of components and fears over the impact of U.S. tariffs. At $499 it would be the same price as a PlayStation 5 (and $50 more than a digital-only model). All eyes will be on Nintendo\u2019s Switch 2 Direct livestream on April 2, when it\u2019s expected to announce the console\u2019s launch date, price, and lineup of games.

It features five bedrooms and nine bathrooms -- and ya gotta click through the gallery to see the ocean views. The massive house also boasts a grand entry foyer with two staircases, a huge terrace, and a full-sized tennis court ... perfect for getting a sweat on before jumping into the pool. The yard also contains a lounge area with outdoor couches ... and also a long table for hosting elaborate outdoor dinner parties. We spoke with Josh Altman -- who holds the listing with his brother, Matt and Josh Flagg -- and, he tells TMZ the property is one of the best investment opportunities he's ever seen, giving the new owners plenty of opportunity to customize the pad to their liking or build a beautiful legacy house. Altman adds, \"I don\u2019t know anywhere else you can get 8 prime acres sitting on top of Beverly Hills completely unobstructed anywhere near this price point.\" Altman says the only reason the couple's selling is 'cause they've decided to embrace apartment living ...

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"The average wholesale price fell to $4.15 per dozen last week, the USDA said. The national average wholesale price of eggs dropped for the third week in a row, as high prices caused falling demand and bird flu outbreaks hit a lull, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The average wholesale price fell to $4.15 per dozen last week, down by $2.70, according to a weekly USDA report released on Friday. Just two weeks ago, on Feb. 28, the average wholesale price was $8.05 per dozen. The combination of prices scaring off customers, slowed bird flu outbreaks and a later Easter this year is resulting in less demand. \"Demand for shell eggs declined sharply over the past week as resistance to current shell egg prices grows across all sectors,\" the USDA report stated. \"Slowing [highly pathogenic avian influenza] outbreaks are leading to improved supply availability and wholesale market prices have responded with sharp declines over the past week.\" \"However, these declines have yet to be reflected at store shelves and, until they are, demand is expected to remain dampened,\" the USDA added. The Justice Department is in the early stages of investigating the major egg producers over soaring egg prices, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News last week. The soaring price of eggs has emerged as a constant political talking point for both parties. President Donald Trump has promised to lower them and Democratic senators, led by Elizabeth Warren, wrote a letter in January calling on the White House to look into producers' and retailers' pricing practices. Trump touted the decrease during an unrelated press event on Friday. \"By the way, price of eggs is down 35% in the last week and a half. We're doing a good job,\" he said. For what consumers actually paid at the store in February, egg prices jumped another 10.4% from January -- 159% over the year ago level, with an average price of $5.90 per dozen, up $0.94 per dozen from last month, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index, which is released monthly. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Business Insider Edition  About five years ago, researchers at OpenAI discovered that combining more computing power and more data in ever-larger training runs\u00a0produces better AI models.          A couple of years later, Google researchers found that adding more data to this mix produces even better results. They showed this by building a new AI model called Chinchilla.               These revelations helped create large language models and other giant models, like GPT-4, that support powerful AI tools such as ChatGPT. Yet in the future, the \"Chinchilla\" strategy of smashing together oodles of computing and mountains of data into bigger and longer pre-training runs may not work as well.               So what if this process doesn't end up being how AI is made in the future? To put it another way: What if the Chinchilla dies?               Building these massive AI models has so far required huge upfront investments. Mountains of data are mashed together in an incredibly complex and compute-intensive process known as pre-training.               This has sparked the biggest wave of infrastructure upgrades in technology's history. Tech companies across the US and elsewhere are frantically erecting energy-sucking data centers packed with Nvidia GPUs.               The rise of new \"reasoning\" models has opened up a new potential future for the AI industry, where the amount of required infrastructure could be much less. We're talking trillions of dollars of capital expenditure that might not happen in coming years.               Recently, Ross Sandler, a top tech analyst at Barclays Capital, and his team estimated the different capex requirements of these two possible outcomes:               The difference is stunning in terms of how much money will or will not be spent. $3 trillion or more in capex is on the line here.               \"Reasoning\" AI models are on the rise, such as OpenAI's o1 and o3 offerings, DeepSeek's R1, and Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking.               These new models use an approach called test-time or inference-time compute, which slices queries into smaller tasks, turning each into a new prompt that the model tackles.               Reasoning models often don't need massive, intense, long pre-training runs to be created. They may take longer to respond, but their outputs can be more accurate, and they can be cheaper to run, too, the Barclays analysts said.               The analysts said that DeepSeek's R1 has shown how open-source reasoning models can drive incredible performance improvements with far less training time, even if this AI lab may have overstated some of its efficiency gains.               \"AI model providers are no longer going to need to solely spend 18-24 months pre-training their next expensive model to achieve step-function improvements in performance,\" the Barclays analysts wrote in a recent note to investors. \"With test-time-compute, smaller base models can run repeated loops and get to a far more accurate response (compared to previous techniques).\"               When it comes to running new models, companies are embracing other techniques that will likely reduce the amount of computing infrastructure needed.               AI labs increasingly use an approach called mixture of experts, or MoE, where smaller \"expert\" models are trained on their tasks and subject areas and work in tandem with an existing huge AI model to answer questions and complete tasks.               In practice, this often means only part of these AI models is used, which reduces the computing required, the Barclays analysts said.               The \"Chinchilla\" approach has worked for the past five years or more, and it's partly why the stock prices of many companies in the AI supply chain have soared.               The Barclays analysts question whether this paradigm can continue because the performance gains from this method may decline as the cost goes up.               \"The idea of spending $10 billion on a pre-training run on the next base model, to achieve very little incremental performance, would likely change,\" they wrote.               Many in the industry also think data for training AI models is running out \u2014 there may not be enough quality information to keep feeding this ravenous chinchilla.               So, top AI companies might stop expanding this process when models reach a certain size. For instance, OpenAI could build its next huge model, GPT-5, but may not go beyond that, the analysts said.               The AI industry has started using \"synthetic\" training data, often generated by existing models. Some researchers think this feedback loop of models helping to create new, better models will take the technology to the next level.               The Chinchillas could, essentially, feed on themselves to survive.               Kinda gross, though that would mean tech companies will still spend massively on AI in the coming years.               \"If the AI industry were to see breakthroughs in synthetic data and recursive self-improvement, then we would hop back on the Chinchilla scaling path, and compute needs would continue to go up rapidly,\" Sandler and his colleagues wrote. \"While not entirely clear right now, this is certainly a possibility we need to consider.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Sales of electric vehicles are down as Musk\u2019s involvement in politics becomes a \u2018distraction\u2019, experts say. The \u201cbromance\u201d between United States President Donald Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk was on full display on Tuesday when the White House South Lawn was transformed into a miniature Tesla showroom. Musk lined up Tesla cars to showcase the electric car producer\u2019s latest innovations while Trump promised to brand anyone vandalising a Tesla car a \u201cdomestic terrorist\u201d following reports of a spate of vandalism and arson attacks on Tesla cars across the country. Trump, known for his strong stance on domestic manufacturing and business leadership, has given Musk a prominent role in his new administration as leader of the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which claims to have uncovered \u201cbillions and billions of dollars in waste, fraud and abuse\u201d in the US federal government \u2013 claims for which Musk and Trump have yet to show significant evidence. Meanwhile, Tesla shares, which are listed on the NASDAQ, are floundering. On Monday this week, they plummeted by 15 percent to end the day at $215 \u2013 the worst day for the stock since 2020 and its lowest level since Trump won the presidential election in November. The shares bounced back a little after Tuesday\u2019s presidential plug for Tesla cars to $231.83 in the morning, before levelling out at about $235 by the end of the day. On Friday, the shares were were due to open at around $240. Tesla stock has been in freefall since its heady highs of more than $435 in mid-December, 2024. So why is the car manufacturer doing so poorly when its owner appears to be flying high at the White House? Despite performing well following the November presidential election in the US, Tesla\u2019s stock was volatile during 2024 overall and has declined sharply since the start of this year. Robert Scott, a specialist in international economics and trade policy, said a fall in the share price was inevitable due to its \u201cextreme overvaluation\u201d. \u201cTesla\u2019s stock was highly overvalued, with one of the highest price-to-earnings ratios ever recorded,\u201d Scott told Al Jazeera. This means the price of the stock was very high compared with the profits the company was generating. \u201cThis indicates that the stock price was inflated relative to market fundamentals.\u201d William Lee, chief economist at the Milken Institute, said the fall in the share price has come about as a result of delays to the launch of new Tesla products. \u201cThe new refresh for the Tesla Model Y continues to be delayed, and more importantly, no new models have been introduced,\u201d Lee said. There has been a marked decrease in sales in Europe and elsewhere. According to data from Business Insider, the business trade news outlet, in February, sales were 76 percent lower in Germany than they were the previous year even though overall sales of electric vehicles were 31 percent higher. Sales in Germany also fell in January following Musk\u2019s endorsement of the far-right AfD party. In Norway, Denmark and Sweden, sales fell 40 percent year on year in February and dropped by 26 percent in France. The company has also been suffering from organised boycott campaigns in the United Kingdom and Portugal.      Further east, Tesla sales plummeted by nearly 50 percent, year on year, in China in February and by a massive 71 percent in Australia. The main reason for these falls in sales is increased competition from traditional automakers as well as new, up-and-coming electric vehicle companies, particularly in China, where automaker BYD reported a 90 percent rise in sales in February. China is Tesla\u2019s second-largest market but government policies there are increasingly favouring domestic manufacturers. Tesla has repeatedly cut vehicle prices in a bid to maintain demand in countries including the US and China. While this strategy has helped to boost short-term sales, experts say, it has also reduced overall earnings, raising concerns among investors about long-term profitability. According to Lee, another major issue weighing on investors\u2019 minds is Tesla\u2019s failure to deliver innovations in self-driving technology and other key areas such as robotics. \u201cInvestors are looking for progress on self-driving, which keeps getting put off, and other disappointments in robotics weigh on investor sentiment,\u201d he said. Without new models or major technological advancements, Tesla is struggling to maintain its reputation as an industry leader, which has further contributed to its stock decline, he added.      Elon Musk also owns several other companies and ventures across various industries, including X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, which he bought for $44bn in 2022. However, his personal wealth is closely tied to Tesla\u2019s stock price. The acquisition of Twitter has become a financial burden, especially as advertisers pull back from it following Musk\u2019s endorsement of various right-wing parties in Europe and his use of X to broadcast his pro-Trump stance. The billionaire was a major financial supporter of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign last year, spending more than $250m while making personal appearances on Trump\u2019s behalf. His political activities have caused anger among some in the US, culminating in protests and arson attacks at Tesla dealerships, factories and charging stations. There has been a spate of attacks on Tesla vehicles around Europe as well, including in Germany where many vehicles have had their tyres slashed. Musk\u2019s activities at DOGE could make him a target for more ire, experts say. DOGE\u2019s moves to scale back the federal government budget and cut thousands of jobs will likely \u201cpush the economy closer to a recession,\u201d according to Scott. \u201cA recession will hit highly leveraged stocks like Tesla particularly hard.\u201d Musk\u2019s political activities have prompted concerns among investors, too, Lee said. \u201cMusk\u2019s active participation in the US government is viewed as a distraction from his ability to drive his companies to produce the innovations that he has promised on time,\u201d he said. While President Trump does not have a direct role in Tesla\u2019s current struggles, his policies, ongoing economic decisions and perceived influence over Musk could have significant implications for the company, experts say. For instance, Trump has historically opposed subsidies for electric vehicle producers and emissions regulations which ultimately benefit companies like Tesla. Trump has also imposed sweeping tariffs on countries including China \u2013 which Tesla still heavily relies on for exports. The continuing trade war with China could disrupt Tesla\u2019s supply chain and reduce its competitiveness in a crucial market.      \u201cTrump\u2019s tariffs are causing other countries to impose countervailing tariffs on US exports. This will hurt Tesla sales abroad,\u201d Scott said. Trump\u2019s efforts to reverse clean energy policies from the Biden administration could also further weaken demand for electric vehicles, including Teslas, Scott added. Beyond Tesla\u2019s financial challenges, Musk\u2019s expanding portfolio of businesses has raised concerns with investors about his ability to effectively lead the company. Scott also pointed to Musk\u2019s involvement in Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency project, something he has no prior experience with before he first tweeted about it in 2020, triggering a 20 percent rise in the value of the cryptocoin created by software engineers in 2013. In April 2021, Musk tweeted about Dogecoin again, causing a 100 percent jump in its value. Then in December that year, Musk announced that he would accept Dogecoin as payment for Tesla merchandise. Since then, Musk has been facing a $258bn lawsuit filed in New York in 2022 alleging he artificially inflated the price of Dogecoin through his social media influence. \u201cMusk\u2019s increased demands on his attention, as he attempts to run both DOGE and his other businesses, means that some of them may suffer simply from lack of his attention,\u201d Scott said. Musk\u2019s increasingly right-wing political stance may also have affected Tesla\u2019s brand perception. Many of the vehicle\u2019s owners tend to be environmentally conscious consumers who support sustainable energy initiatives and are not natural Trump supporters, experts say. According to Lee, Musk appears to be making a deliberate choice to engage in US government affairs at the expense of Tesla\u2019s performance. \u201cWhile he is trying to be patriotic and do good for the country, his investors and companies are being sacrificed for the good of the future of the United States,\u201d Lee said.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Well\u2026 the GPU market is pretty messed up at the moment. No stock of the cards people actually want to buy, inflated prices when models do become available, and plenty of allegations of fake MSRPs. So what on earth is going on? Why are prices so high? Do GeForce RTX 50 and Radeon RX 9000 series GPUs actually have fake MSRPs? Where do things stand right now? That's exactly what we'll be exploring in this GPU pricing update. As a quick recap on the current state of the market: There have been six new graphics card releases so far in 2025 \u2013 four from Nvidia and two from AMD.  Nvidia's new RTX 50 GPUs launched with announced prices ranging from $550 to $2,000, but upon release, these cards were extremely scarce, often completely unavailable at MSRP and typically priced at least 20% higher \u2013 selling out even at that inflated price. AMD launched two new Radeon models at $550 and $600, and while their supply was stronger than Nvidia's at launch, MSRP models were still limited. The average price for a premium AIB model was significantly higher. Some retailers have even raised prices upon receiving restocks \u2013 or worse, during release day \u2013 further hurting consumers.  The first thing we want to address is why pricing and availability have been so poor, or at least provide some insights based on conversations with various people in the supply chain. This is a highly complex issue with many contributing factors, but we'll do our best to piece it all together. The first factor affecting the entire GPU market leading up to these launches was the premature discontinuation of previous-gen models. Both AMD and Nvidia initially planned to launch their new graphics cards earlier. As of mid-2024, the GeForce 50 series was expected to launch around November 2024, while RDNA 4 was set for January 2025. However, both launches were delayed \u2013 Nvidia to January and AMD to March. By the time these launches were pushed back, efforts were already underway to clear out existing inventory in preparation for the original launch schedule. In late 2024, reports surfaced of GeForce 40 series models being discontinued and selling out around November and December \u2013 timed to align with the expected new GPU launches. A similar situation occurred with AMD. With the launches delayed, this process drained the market of GPU supply. For several months, anyone looking to buy a graphics card at certain price points \u2013 especially in the mid-range and above \u2013 had very few options. By the time the new graphics cards finally launched, this created a sense of scarcity, fueling FOMO and driving demand even higher. While this scarcity was not necessarily intentional, it was largely the result of unfortunate timing.  As for the AMD RDNA 4 launch and why pricing was far from ideal, multiple factors were at play. Based on our understanding, board partners began producing the Radeon 9070 XT and RX 9070 in late 2024 for the original January launch, with cards being sold to retailers who stockpiled them in warehouses. Both AIBs purchasing GPU dies from AMD and retailers purchasing finished cards from AIBs were operating under early target prices. While payment structures vary, money was exchanged with the expectation of a certain price point. This system typically works by setting the early target price at the upper end of AMD's expected MSRP range. If the final announced price is lower than what AIBs, distributors, and retailers anticipated, AMD provides rebates to the supply chain. These rebates come in different forms, but the most common method is direct reimbursement to retailers. Retailers initially pay a higher price to stockpile the cards, then AMD refunds the difference, allowing the cards to be sold at the announced MSRP. There are often conditions tied to these rebates \u2013 for example, full rebates may only be granted if a certain percentage of stock is sold \u2013 creating incentives for retailers to promote the models. Some retailers receive these rebates as marketing development funds (MDF), but the goal remains the same: ensuring the cards reach the announced price.  Another rebate method involves compensating AIBs directly. If AIBs initially purchased GPU dies from AMD at a higher price, they receive rebates so that when they sell cards to retailers, the models can hit the advertised MSRP without AIBs taking a loss. However, AMD seems to prefer rebating retailers, as this approach provides additional marketing benefits that might not come from rebating AIBs directly. With the RDNA 4 launch, the early target price for the cards was quite high. While we don't have an exact figure, retailers we spoke to expected the Radeon 9070 XT to be priced around $700. To actually sell the cards at the $600 MSRP, AMD would need to provide roughly a $100 rebate per unit. This process is fairly standard behind the scenes \u2013 retailers report their stock levels, and AMD issues a lump-sum rebate accordingly.  The main reason we've heard for the variability in RDNA 4 pricing \u2013 and why some regions have been hit with significantly worse prices than others \u2013 is that AMD has allegedly been selective with rebates. Here's an example of how this might work using theoretical numbers: Let's say a brand offers three variants of the 9070 XT: a base card targeting the MSRP, a mid-range model, and a premium OC model. These cards were sold to retailers in January based on an early target price of, say, $700. That means the base card would be $700, the mid-range model $750, and the premium model $800 \u2013 a fairly standard 14% premium for the flagship card. Then AMD announces that the official price is actually $600. To hit the MSRP and maintain logical pricing across all models, AMD would need to rebate all cards by $100 per unit. This would lower the base card to $600, the mid-range to $650, and the premium to $700. Ideally, this is how the system should work. However, if AMD is selective and only rebates the base model, the base card drops to $600, while the mid-range card stays at $750 and the premium card at $800. Since those higher-end models didn't receive a rebate, retailers \u2013 who purchased and stockpiled them months ago at the original price \u2013 are left selling them at the higher cost. This is essentially what has happened. Ready to ship to happy customers pic.twitter.com\/ih1rdend8S For example, OCUK publicly stated they had thousands of RDNA 4 cards in stock but that the \"MSRP is capped at a quantity of a few hundred.\" Based on discussions with retailers, this likely occurred because the rebate was limited and didn't apply to all models. Microcenter, for instance, appears to have received a broader MSRP rebate than European and Australian retailers, who have struggled to reach MSRP pricing for many models. This is the main reason you may have seen prices increase for base models and other variants on launch day. Once a retailer sells enough cards to match their allocated AMD rebate, they have to raise prices to avoid selling at a loss. This is the main reason you may have seen prices increase for base models and other variants on launch day. Once a retailer sells enough cards to match their allocated AMD rebate, they have to raise prices to avoid selling at a loss. This also likely explains why some retailers canceled orders after they were placed \u2013 because they received further clarification on their rebate amount (which is often uncertain before launch) and couldn't fulfill the orders at the original price. This situation has frustrated both retailers and AIBs. Retailers are frustrated by the rebate amount and the uncertainty surrounding how many units will receive rebates per shipment. AIBs are frustrated because they have already produced and sold the cards to retailers, expecting AMD to provide rebates at an appropriate level. Since AMD hasn't rebated AIBs directly for the GPU dies they purchased and used, AIBs are unable to lower prices themselves.  Of course, this is only part of the explanation. When there is high demand around a launch, there's less incentive to sell cards at a reasonable price and plenty of motivation to scalp and maximize profits. This can happen at all levels of the supply chain \u2013 retailers, distributors, and AIBs \u2013 and the extent of this behavior varies depending on the company, the retailer, and the region. So while we've received information from multiple sources about what happened, it doesn't rule out questionable pricing tactics. Some entities may have preemptively raised prices to offset an expected rebate, increased prices under the guise of high demand, or forced retailers into unfavorable bundle deals. The list goes on. Just because selective rebating played a role at launch doesn't mean it will remain the sole reason for high prices moving forward.  So what about post-launch? Why are prices still high? Right now, there is a period of uncertainty, and it's too early to call the RDNA 4 MSRP fake. This is due to several factors, the primary one being that shipments arriving at retailers in the weeks after launch were arranged beforehand under the system we just described. It takes time to ship GPUs. With the initial wave of rebates already used up, when these pre-arranged shipments arrive, retailers are unable to offer them at MSRP because they weren't purchased at that price. They might be rebated, but there's uncertainty around whether that will happen, so most retailers aren't selling those cards at MSRP. This is why, if you check Newegg right now, you'll see base 9070 XT models like the PowerColor Reaper listed at $700 instead of the $600 MSRP, and the Asrock Steel Legend at $670. List prices have increased because those prices reflect incoming shipments that were purchased at higher costs.  Another factor is that AMD announced the price very close to launch \u2013 just a week beforehand \u2013 and the final price was significantly different from initial expectations. You may have noticed the dubbing over the pricing sections in AMD's announcement video, indicating that AMD was still finalizing the price just days before the reveal. If the price difference had been only $20 \u2013 50, it would have taken less time for that adjustment to ripple through shipments. In that case, rebates would have been smaller and less disruptive. Also see: AMD calls demand for Radeon 9070 and 9070 XT \"unprecedented,\" says restocking at MSRP is priority number one AMD's RDNA 4 could go one of two ways... The good path \u2013 the one we hope for \u2013 is that AMD is already selling GPUs to AIBs at a price that allows the $600 MSRP to be met. Once those units are shipped to retailers, they would be available at MSRP without requiring additional rebates. In the period between launch and those shipments arriving, prices might not be ideal, but they would stabilize within a month or so. The bad path is if little to no effort is made to bring prices down. For example, if AMD doesn't sell GPUs to AIBs at a price that allows for MSRP pricing and instead continues relying on selective rebates, MSRP supply will remain limited. Alternatively, if AIBs and retailers receive GPUs at lower prices but choose to mark them up due to high demand. Under these conditions, it would be reasonable to call the MSRP fake.  At this stage, it could go either way. People we've spoken to in the industry also don't know whether future shipments will be priced competitively, only that current shipments are arriving at higher-than-MSRP prices. Yes, it seems like AMD could have done more to ensure better GPU pricing at launch and in the weeks that followed. However, if prices return to MSRP within a month or two, this wouldn't be much different from other graphics card launches where demand initially outstrips supply \u2013 meaning it wouldn't necessarily indicate a fake MSRP. For what it's worth, AMD's official statement claims that MSRP models will be available beyond launch and suggests they are working to maintain that pricing. The statement, from Frank Azor, reads: \"It is inaccurate that $549\/$599 MSRP is launch-only pricing. We expect cards to be available from multiple vendors at $549\/$599 (excluding tariffs\/taxes) based on the work we have done with our AIB partners, and more are coming. At the same time, the AIBs have different premium configurations at higher price points and those will also continue.\" Whether or not this is true remains to be seen.  With Nvidia GeForce GPUs, we're dealing with a different situation. Instead of a launch where retailers stockpiled graphics cards well in advance of the official pricing announcement, we're seeing the opposite. Nvidia revealed the GeForce 50 series long before launch, announced pricing for all models, and even allowed RTX 5090 reviews a week ahead of release \u2013 yet failed to supply the market with anywhere near enough cards. It has been difficult to determine exactly what's happening with availability and pricing, but the feedback from retailers has been consistent: supply is far too low (let's not forget Nvidia makes a ton more money from AI now).  Graph by App Economy Insights This contradicts Nvidia's official statements, where they claim supply is actually strong and that they've shipped large volumes of cards \u2013 just that demand is exceptionally high. So what's really going on? Our take is that Nvidia's statement is misleading. They claim that in the first few weeks since the 50 series launch, they have shipped twice as many units as they did during the same period for the 40 series. Except there's a big elephant in the data here: with the 40 series, Nvidia launched the RTX 4090 on October 2022, followed by the RTX 4080 a month later. It wasn't until January 2023 \u2013 nearly three months later \u2013 that the RTX 4070 Ti was released. In contrast, with the 50 series, Nvidia released four models within five weeks.  So when looking at the first 4 \u2013 5 weeks of sales, the RTX 40 series launch included only the 4090 and, for about a week, the 4080. But with the 50 series we have the 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti and 5070 \u2013 Nvidia are claiming all four of those models combined reach 2x the shipments of mostly the 4090. Is that supposed to be impressive? Retailers \u2013 at least here in Australia \u2013 have told us that compared to the 40 series launch, they received fewer 50 series models, especially when comparing the RTX 5090 to the RTX 4090. The model in highest supply has been the RTX 5080, with availability similar to the RTX 4080 Super, but the other models have fallen short of 40 series launch volumes. While combined 50 series shipments may exceed those of the 4090 alone, that's hardly an apples-to-apples comparison.  Retailers are also reporting higher-than-expected demand, even for models that weren't reviewed particularly well, which has contributed to shortages. Some of this demand could stem from what we discussed earlier \u2013 many gamers have been unable to buy even last-gen models for months leading up to these launches. Others may have skipped the 40 series and waited for an upgrade now that the 50 series has arrived. We are pretty confident supply has been inadequate, even for a launch that hasn't seen overwhelming demand.  Granted, there are silicon supply side considerations that potentially explain the lack of volume in shipments. These include Nvidia prioritizing TSMC 4N wafers for higher-margin server and workstation products and constraints with GDDR7 memory. There have also been rumors of production issues with the RTX 5070, in addition to the missing ROPs situation for other models. However, we have not been able to confirm whether the 5070's launch supply was directly affected by production issues. At the very least, the RTX 5070 Founders Edition from Nvidia won't be available until later this month, which is curious, to say the least. For the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti in particular, low supply could be explained by its die configuration. It uses the same GB203 die as the RTX 5080, along with the same 16GB memory capacity, built on a now-mature TSMC node with good yields. The cost to manufacture a 5070 Ti is likely not much different from a 5080, and there won't be many defective dies available for lower-tier cards.  If Nvidia is waiting for defective silicon, supply will be constrained, leading them to prioritize the 5080 instead. We've been told that 5080 supply is significantly stronger than the 5070 Ti. On top of that, there would be little incentive to sell the 5070 Ti at its $750 MSRP if it costs nearly the same to produce as the $1,000 5080. On the more shady front, we've heard rumors of backchannel dealings in which Nvidia GPUs are being sold directly to exporters, potentially through Singapore to China \u2013 sometimes referred to as the \"Singapore loophole.\" Recently, three men were charged with fraud in Singapore for illegally transferring Nvidia AI GPUs to China, though that case specifically involved server-grade hardware rather than gaming GPUs. However, Blackwell cards like the RTX 5090 are also attractive for AI workloads, and there are whispers that 5090 supply is being diverted from the gaming market to AI companies. We're not suggesting Nvidia itself is involved, but rather that certain players in the supply chain may be exploiting this situation. This could help explain why RTX 5090s have been so difficult to find and why prices remain so inflated. Allegedly, exporters are willing to pay far above list price for a 5090, driving up prices in the gaming market and reducing supply. However, this wouldn't affect supply for lower-end cards that lack AI demand. These factors primarily explain the supply issues, but they don't fully account for the extreme pricing. We have no concrete evidence for why, when supply does arrive, pricing remains excessively high. Our best guess is that this is simply scalping enabled by low supply, with Nvidia doing little to prevent it. AIBs know supply is limited, so they are pricing custom models well above MSRP, and Nvidia is not incentivizing the production of MSRP models. Most restocks have consisted of expensive premium models, especially for the highest-tier Blackwell GPUs.  It's worth noting that in some countries, it is illegal for Nvidia to force AIBs to sell products at a specific price. Nvidia can set the price of Founders Edition cards, but they cannot require AIBs to sell their models at MSRP. However, this does not mean Nvidia is powerless \u2013 they could encourage MSRP pricing through other means, such as adjusting GPU quotas for AIBs that fail to meet base pricing, selling GPUs at a cost that actually allows for MSRP pricing, or producing more Founders Edition cards to anchor pricing. Nvidia, however, does not seem particularly interested in doing this. Of course, there is a delicate balance \u2013 producing too many Founders Edition cards could upset AIB partners, who are responsible for the bulk of GPU production. One of the most suspicious and difficult-to-explain aspects of the current pricing situation is the massive jump in price from base models to the next tier up. For the RTX 5070 Ti, base models are listed at $750, but the next step up is $900 for a mid-range OC model. The RTX 5080 jumps from $1,000 to $1,200 or even $1,300. The RTX 5090 quickly climbs to $2,600 and is essentially unavailable. None of this can be attributed to selective rebates like with AMD products, since Nvidia announced prices before cards were shipped to retailers \u2013 meaning the advertised price should reflect the cost retailers and AIBs paid for the GPUs.  Is Nvidia controlling supply to keep prices high for as long as possible? It's certainly one possible explanation. It might make sense for the high-end 5080 and 5090, but for the RTX 5070 Ti, which faces real competition from AMD, artificially inflating prices would be counterproductive. The one exception to these extreme price hikes is the RTX 5070. It moves from $550 for base MSRP models to around $600 for the next step up \u2013 for example, upgrading from a Gigabyte Windforce to a Gigabyte Eagle. At this point, it's clear that the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 have a fake MSRP \u2013 you simply aren't buying those GPUs at $1,000 and $2,000 At this point, it's clear that the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 have a fake MSRP \u2013 you simply aren't buying those GPUs at $1,000 and $2,000. Most shipments to retailers consist of premium models, available in limited quantities at inflated prices. For example, in the most recent RTX 5080 restock at PC Case Gear, the cheapest model was the Asus Prime at $2,600 AUD \u2013 29% over MSRP, equivalent to $1,500. The rest of the models were even more disgustingly expensive high-end variants. The RTX 5070 Ti is basically at that point now, too. Just three weeks after launch, supply is very limited, and its MSRP is effectively meaningless. The RTX 5070 remains a wait-and-see situation, though in Australia, at least one MSRP model is available for pre-order with an ETA next week \u2013 more promising than anything we've seen for the other 50-series cards.  In summary, the GPU market right now is screwed up, and there's a multitude of factors at play: the premature discontinuation of older models, delays in the new generation, poor supply for Nvidia's RTX 50 series leading to scalping, rebate issues with Radeon cards, overwhelming GPU demand due to AI, sneaky exporting, and even tariffs have all played a role. It's incredibly difficult to buy a GPU at a reasonable price, and we strongly encourage waiting for better deals instead of purchasing at inflated prices. Will things get better? There are reasons to believe they will. Competition is heating up, particularly in the upper mid-range, which should eventually lead to price adjustments as supply stabilizes. AMD has every reason to keep flooding the market with Radeon 9070 XTs, and if that happens, it will be difficult to maintain high 9070 XT prices. In turn, this would make it even harder for Nvidia and its partners to justify keeping the 5070 Ti at $900 (or simply give up on that segment, which would directly benefit AMD). The high-end GPU market could remain problematic for longer, but for the more recent releases, we are still in the early stages. If we check back a month or two from now and prices remain absurdly high, that will be a major red flag. As always, we will continue monitoring the GPU market and holding companies accountable in the coming months. Coming up soon on TechSpot (as soon as next week), we'll publish a GPU cost per frame value comparison, analyzing gaming performance against real-world pricing in multiple regions. This should provide a clear picture of which models offer the best value to gamers right now. We also have a few ideas for better tracking real-world pricing trends, and we'll keep that data updated throughout the year. Stay tuned.

They discuss the tension between flexible research tools and robust production systems; the challenges of ML in a low-data, high-noise environment subject to frequent regime changes; and the shift from simple linear models to deep neural networks. Welcome to Signals and Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack from Jane Street. I\u2019m Ron Minsky. All right, it is my pleasure to introduce In Young Cho. In Young has been a researcher and trader here at Jane Street for almost a decade now, and we\u2019re going to talk a little bit about what that experience has been like and also about In Young\u2019s more recent move to join the research group here, where she\u2019s leading a lot of the work that we\u2019re doing in the machine learning space. Thanks for joining. Thank you for having me. To kick things off, it would be interesting to talk about how you got to Jane Street in the first place. My path to Jane Street is actually pretty standard for a lot of the traders and researchers that we have here in undergrad. I was very confused about what I wanted to do. Like many of us, I was convinced that originally that I wanted to be a doctor following my mom\u2019s path, but I had also been quite active in competition math in high school. So I had a very strange blend of biology, organic chemistry, and advanced math classes in my freshman year of college and for various reasons that are probably not that interesting to go into, I realized that medical school was not going to be a great fit for me and I had a bit of an identity crisis where I tried to figure out what I wanted to do. So maybe that\u2019s not that standard. Fast forward a little bit with some time off in Korea where I explored a variety of different internship paths via some short-ish internships in various industries where I concluded that I absolutely wanted to never consider industry. I ended up back in sort of the recruiting cycle back in college where a lot of my smart friends told me that they really enjoyed the application and the interview process at Jane Street and that I should just check it out. The interview process was extremely challenging. I remember emerging from the onsite day that I had where my brain was just completely dead. I don\u2019t know if you ever have this experience where if you\u2019ve been thinking really hard, your head overheats. I had that in the middle of the day. Literally overheats. It just literally overheats. It\u2019s like a computer. I kind of strangely liked that experience and even though I didn\u2019t really know what finance is or what to expect from this mysterious proprietary trading company, I wanted to give the internship a shot. So I guess that was pretty long-winded. In short, I came straight out of undergrad after interning at Jane Street in my sophomore year and despite not knowing anything about quantitative finance when I came in, I\u2019ve really enjoyed the everyday of the job here. I feel like I learn something new every day. I\u2019m kind of curious about the internship itself. What was it about the character of the internship that made you think, oh yeah, this is the thing I want to do now? Just how dynamic it is. I would just come in every day and I was basically tasked with a new type of puzzle or a new type of skillset that I needed to learn. There were people who were learning these new things with me and I think there was just a tremendous support network of people who were very invested in making sure that I was having a good experience and that I was making the most of my own human capital. So that says nothing to the actual work itself. I mean the work itself was pretty interesting as well, and I think more interesting than I had thought just coming into the internship, but the majority of what drove me was just how well-meaning and how smart and also intellectually humble the other interns were and also what I thought would be the support network that I had once I joined full-time. So when you started at Jane Street full-time, what kind of work did you end up doing? Where did you land in the organization and what was your job? The title that I had was as a quantitative trader and that does not adequately capture it at all. I think the job of a trader is very varied and so in my first year I did all sorts of things ranging from learning how to use OCaml, which is the language that we use in-house; learning how to use VBA as the backend programming language\u2026 to Excel Another programming language we\u2019ve used a lot in-house. That\u2019s true Learning all about bash and SQL and about financial terms, learning how to pick up the phone and respond to brokers and that was terrifying. I have many, many mishaps trying to use the phone at work. A funny story was there was a call coming in from an external client and somebody, folks on my desk said, you\u2019ve been here for a month, you can pick up the phone. And I picked up the phone and I froze and eventually I said, \u201cah, this is Jane Street\u201d rather than \u201cJane Street\u2014This is In young\u201d and I needed to grab a hold of somebody else and I basically needed to pass the phone to somebody else on the desk. I was told that I was supposed to park the phone and I had no idea what that meant. And at that point I basically went with it and thought park was a magic code word. I put down the phone and yelled out the word park. So you hung up on them? No, no, no, because yelling out the word park doesn\u2019t do anything. And my mentor sitting next to me kindly said, there\u2019s a button on your phone called Park, that\u2019s what you press. I said, okay, I will go and do that. So there\u2019s that kind of stuff. Learning about the basics of trading. Can we go back to the broker thing? I feel like people\u2019s mental model of Jane Street is often very focused around having heard things about the technology. And so they imagine a room full of people where all they\u2019re doing is sitting down and writing programs and then the programs do trading. And so the whole thing of getting a call from a broker, why do we take broker calls? What is even going on here at the business level? So that was not very standard for Jane Street. It was a new business that I think came about in 2013. I think prior to around 2013, the main way that we interacted was anonymously through electronic exchanges. Of course we would call people up or if we had to talk to our prime brokers or to various people where we needed their services, we would of course talk to people in person, but it wasn\u2019t the case that we were explicitly interfacing with customers or clients or anything like that. So one model that you might have of the financial markets is that everything is kind of anonymous and everything happens on exchange and that should lead to fair and efficient outcomes. And for the most part I think this is true, but there are cases where it\u2019s helpful to be able to know who your end counterparty is and to be able to negotiate the trade or the service that they would like from the market prior to them having to go out into the market and buying a stock or selling an ETF themselves. So one example is if you have a pension service for some state and they have a quarterly rebalance that they need to do, pension services can be quite large. And so even if what they\u2019re doing is doing a pretty vanilla rebalance of buying an index fund, the dollar quantities involved might be quite large. And you can imagine as a market maker on an electronic exchange, that being on the opposite side of a flow that is millions of dollars can be quite disconcerting. You\u2019ll have on your computer program that is designed to interact on the exchange, sold a share of XYZ stock, and then you\u2019ll continue to sell on the exchange and you\u2019ll basically say, what am I missing? How large is the eventual size going to be? And in that uncertainty, a thing that you might say is, well, it might just be the case that I\u2019m getting something very wrong and I\u2019m going to make sure that I do something a little bit more conservative while I try to figure things out. And this I think ends up with less good execution for the retirement service or the pension service who\u2019s trying to do a trade that is quite benign and quite innocuous. So if we know from the get-go who we\u2019re interacting with, it\u2019s much easier for us to have confidence and to also give financial advice of how you might go about executing a trade in the index fund. So I think back in 2013 we started more earnestly building up a business where we were onboarding clients and in the flow of being able to make a market directly to the end client, there\u2019s many types of people that we would pick up the phone for, but you can imagine that most phone trading is with these counterparties that we know and have onboarded where there\u2019s some bilateral agreement that we will be out there making markets for them and also in non-live cases offering advice on how to think about the executions that they might want. All of this highlights the odd role of information in trading. You might think, oh, the world\u2019s anonymous electronic markets, that\u2019s the best way to execute things because it\u2019s a fair and equal platform. But the pension service is a great example where there\u2019s an extra piece of information which is actually useful to all involved to know, which is that the pension company is not a highly informed trader who\u2019s making a trade with you, they know stuff that you don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s just someone who\u2019s making a big transaction because it\u2019s part of their ordinary business. It doesn\u2019t reflect some information that\u2019s private to them about the markets. And so there\u2019s a weird way in which knowing where it\u2019s coming from can allow you to provide better services\u2014in particular just like a better price\u2014in a very simple way, you can charge them less money because who\u2019s coming and the size of the trade that they\u2019re doing. Okay. So that says a little bit about why this whole system of people calling each other on the phone even exists in the world\u2019s modern markets. And so why we took part in it, your whole work wasn\u2019t just answering the phone for brokers. What other kinds of things were you working on? Yeah, as I kind of mentioned, I learned how to code poorly and wrote a lot of different systems and apps on the desk that were very useful to my day-to-day work. It might have to do with making it easier to visualize the types of trades that I\u2019m doing on a day-to-day basis, whether that\u2019s on the market, open the market close or during the day or tools that will allow me to sort of go back and analyze the trades that we\u2019ve done or the opportunities that we had to see if there\u2019s more trades that we could propose based off historical patterns that we\u2019ve seen. And so at a high level, a way that you could describe these two kind of workflows is like software engineering and research and very crudely the picking up the phone I think people might describe as live trading, but in terms of the day-to-day these would all sort of blend together and it was pretty cool that I got to basically hone my skills and learn a lot about each of these individual items and see how it all ties together. And on that point about live trading hard of, it\u2019s about literally answering the phone and talking to a broker, but I think of that as a little more broadly about live realtime decision making and some of that has to do with some individual trade with an individual concrete person, but a lot of it has to do with thinking about all of the systems and all of the different ways that we have of trading and understanding what\u2019s going on in the markets and figuring out how to adjust and influence the behavior of those systems. The intermixing of those three things that I think are really critical part of what makes Jane Street good at trading and what it means to trade in a modern way in the markets. Yeah, it\u2019s very confusing that we conflate all three of these things in the same role and title of trader and it is I think a very, very common source of confusion for clients interfacing with Jane Street for what a trader is here. I think we\u2019ve embraced it and think that the fuzziness allows us to make sure that we\u2019re placing individuals in the role that they\u2019re going to most shine at or be best at. But it\u2019s certainly very confusing if you\u2019re just trying to get a sense of what Jane Street is before you\u2019re familiar with us. And it\u2019s not like the terminology we use aligns with the terminology of the rest of the industry. When people say trader, they often mean very different things. It\u2019s not just us though. I think a lot of places have very bespoke and confusing names and titles for all of these roles and honestly it does make it pretty hard to navigate the overall landscape. So a lot of your work today is focused on research and today you\u2019re actually on the research desk, but I think research, as you said, has been a part of your work the whole way through. Can you give us a little more texture of what does it mean to do research on a trading idea? Yeah, so I\u2019m going to attempt to break down the process of research into a few steps. So I think there are roughly four stages of research. One is the initial exploration stage. So what might be important here, you need to have highly interactive tooling that you\u2019re familiar with that can display information in a very rich, performant and easily understandable way such that you can rapidly iterate through various hypotheses and ideas that you might want to explore further. And When you say tools like tools for what should I imagine like a Bloomberg terminal for pulling up the candlesticks on the stock, what are we doing with these tools? Let me set the stage as maybe you want to be able to do trading research where you are trying to look at how to best interact with this pension service that we mentioned. And so one of the things that you might want to know is what are some of the trading ideas that you might have? What is the appropriate market that you should show to the orders that this client might have and what can we do infrastructurally in terms of our understanding of financial markets to better equip ourselves to be able to quote this order for the initial exploration stage here? I guess this would correspond to having a Bloomberg terminal and basically saying, who is this counterparty? What does their portfolio look like? Can we get a sense of how often their portfolio churns? And one thing that is pretty handy on a Bloomberg terminal is that you can look at people\u2019s 13F or 13G or 13D filings and tjust get a sense quarter over quarter how people\u2019s positions have changed. And so you have some sense of the order flow that you might be seeing from this pension service. You\u2019re probably not seeing all of it, but you can also from the data that is available from the tooling like a Bloomberg terminal, get more data points for what happened for instance on days where we weren\u2019t the people who were showing the end order to the client. And you basically want to know what their positions are and what the flow might be like that tells you something about what the likely market impact is of the trading. The bigger the impact is, the more you have to move the price and essentially charge them for the fact that all of this trading is going to move the market a lot. Yeah, that\u2019s right. Great. Cool. So a second interrelated step is maybe you have a hypothesis that the majority of the trading that this pension service does is pretty benign. It doesn\u2019t move markets a lot, but they have one position in their portfolio that is a little bit weird and whenever they trade it moves markets a lot. And a thing that you might want to explore as a hypothesis is when Jane Street isn\u2019t the person who receives this order, there\u2019s more outsize impact or we might be able to anticipate without getting the order itself when the client might be executing and to basically seek to give a better end price to the pension service. And so an important step here is data collection. Things that you need is the dates that the client might have traded, the sizes that they might have traded, as well as the times that they traded and the returns during those times where there were large trades. There are obviously other pieces of information that you might need and you need a way to robustly collect this information in a way where you\u2019re going to be able to do a study or build a model on it. Right? There\u2019s a ton of infrastructure you need around this to do it well because the underlying data sets kind of suck. There\u2019s all sorts of weird things. There\u2019s a stock split and a ticker name change and just all sorts of other problems and errors in the data that you need to figure out how to adjust for and paper over as part of generating these high quality data sets that let you do research. And if it\u2019s just full of these mistakes, then garbage and garbage out, your research isn\u2019t going to get you anything good. Absolutely, and you can start with the simplest possible case where in the data generation phase here, you could do it all manually and you could check things very, very carefully. And I think that\u2019s actually a great way to build intuitions about all the ways that you could experience errors instead of starting from the get go from a dataset with millions if not billions of rows, where it\u2019s difficult to get an intuition for what sorts of checks matter. But I agree that data collection is a very tricky and very, very important task. So once you have the data, you kind of get to do the step that I think most people think of as research and is kind of the most fun. You basically say, I have this data, there is a thing that I\u2019m trying to predict. And you also have to be kind of creative about what sorts of data or features matter and what sorts of things you\u2019re trying to predict. I guess at Jane Street we often refer to these as responders. I think in the external world these might be sort of referred to as dependent variables. I think responders is kind of a term that is not often used outside of Jane Street\u2019s walls. I think predictors and responders is I think just older statistical lingo. I think I was using predictors and responders 20 years ago when I was doing bad trading related research and I do not think I made it up, but Cool. There\u2019s a fun mailing list at Jane Street that I refuse to subscribe to called social polls and it was very divisive like what you should refer to these predictors or features, what is the proper nomenclature? So I think at Jane Street there are many camps of beliefs on what the correct terminology is. So you have the data and you want to make some predictions and you have to basically figure out the way that you want to transform the data in order to make predictions. You have a lot of options available to you here for the toy case that I mentioned where you\u2019re working with a hand scraped dataset with a handful of data points in terms of the complexity of the model and the expressability of the models versus how much you\u2019re likely to overfit. You probably want to go as simple as possible. And so a technique that you might want to have is something like a linear regression, but for different types of data sets and especially as the feature set grows or the interaction effects that you\u2019re trying to model get increasingly more complex, a linear regression is probably not going to cut it and you\u2019re going to have to rely on more sophisticated machine learning methods, including the deep learning methods that I think comprise the majority of my puzzling and thinking these days. I mentioned that it\u2019s four steps for research, and so I think I\u2019m cutting some steps out, but I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention I think a very, very important step in research, which is the productionization step. Once you have a model in predictions, that\u2019s great and it\u2019s really cool that you\u2019ve been able to get the idea that you had all the way to the stage of having predictions that hopefully you\u2019ll believe out of sample, but in a lot of ways the battle is only halfway done at that point. You need a way to make sure that you have a way to express these predictions in the markets. So you need to kind of think about what is the most effective way to express these beliefs and you also need to make sure that you have the tech available in order to reliably execute the trade that you thought that you were executing. And so there\u2019s a lot of pitfalls along the way here and the more complex the trade gets the more work you need to put into make sure that you don\u2019t run into various issues in this productionization process. Especially if what you\u2019re doing is you\u2019re doing research using one set of tools and you\u2019re doing your actual production implementation with a completely different set of tools. The research toolsmight be an Excel spreadsheet or a Python notebook or some other thing, and then your production system is maybe some trading system that\u2019s written in OCaml that has a totally different way of doing the mathematics and expressing the configuration and all that. I feel like this kind of from the very beginning, we\u2019ve had two different styles of research that we\u2019ve used. One has been one where you do the productionization almost from the beginning where you have more or less a kind of automated trading system. You have the code for that, and then the process of research really looks like simulation where you go and build some kind of simulated framework to run something that looks like that final study and you can sort of see what at least the simulated behavior looks like. And then the other approach, which is mostly what you\u2019re talking about is where you have some kind of backed off abstracted simplified version of the kind of data and problem from what you would get in real time and trying to build and validate your hypothesis there. And then later you figure out how to do the transformation into the thing that you run in production. I\u2019m kind of curious how you think about the trade-off between these two different approaches. I think it\u2019s difficult if you\u2019re going into a completely new area of trading to have conviction on what the end production system should look like and to build something with all the bells and whistles and all the features that you need that you\u2019re ultimately going to need in order to be able to trade at scale. And in those cases where you\u2019re doing a lot of exploratory work or the various ideas that you have are somewhat low conviction and unlikely to succeed, it just makes sense to prioritize flexibility and versatility of iterating through hypotheses above having robust production systems. Now of course, this bites us, has bitten us in many ways where a lot of the studies that we\u2019ve done where it\u2019s been fast markets and quick and dirty studies that were with tooling that was never meant to be used for production has led to challenges in terms of how much robustness we can expect in production. And this is versus cases where we have a very mature system and the types of research that we\u2019re doing are more what you might expect from robust data science. You\u2019re running experiments, you\u2019re trying to add a couple parameters to the hundreds of parameters that control a very complex trading system that you have. And oftentimes when you are operating in this way, it can be pretty frustrating because you\u2019ll have to learn a whole library ecosystem that exists for the production system in order to make even a very small change. And I wouldn\u2019t say that one style of research or one style of work is inherently better or worse. I think it just kind of depends on the maturity of the work that you are sort of adding onto as well as the newness of the market that you\u2019re exploring and also kind of the style of research that you\u2019re doing. Yeah, I mean I think that\u2019s been a pretty difficult tension to navigate at Jane Street because there isn\u2019t an obvious answer of should you preference a very, very robust system that\u2019s going to be a little bit hard to learn and have a steep learning curve to or should you have a system that\u2019s going to be a nightmare to administrate, but gives a lot of flexibility to the people who are doing the exploratory analysis. And it\u2019s something that I think different desks just operate differently on. There are some desks that are highly algorithmic and have under their hands every day all the time the code of the systems they\u2019re working on. And then for at least some of the kinds of research you want to do, doing an incremental change to that system is the easiest most natural step to evaluating some new idea. If you have control over the trading system and the feature engineering tool set, I want to add a new feature, I\u2019m going to write the code that actually extracts that information in a direct way. And then you have a thing which sort of has that tight connection to reality there. Even in that world, I think doing all of your research by simulation has a lot of downsides. This is a pure performance problem of there\u2019s an enormous amount of raw data that needs to be clawed through in real time. And so having ways of taking that complex dataset and distilling it down to something which you can just in a more lightweight way operate with is really important. I think a thing that\u2019s maybe obvious but I think really essential to research going well is having a short iteration time. You really need a short time to joy, whether it\u2019s like you have some idea you can try it out and just at runtime, it has to happen reasonably fast so you can try new ideas and see how they work and discard the bad ones. In research, most of the ideas are bad. And you\u2019ve been involved in research as part of the trading work you\u2019ve done for a long time now. I\u2019m curious how you feel like the character of that research work has evolved over the 10 years that you\u2019ve seen it here. Yeah, so the image that I have in mind is, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen that meme of the, well, it\u2019s not really a meme. You have various stages of drawing and you might be trying to draw a horse and at the initial stages it\u2019s like a very bad outline of a horse and you can recognize it but it\u2019s not filled in. And as you go you\u2019ll add some colors and textures and by then there\u2019s a beautiful painting of a horse and you just need to kind of go through all the stages. And I can\u2019t say that I\u2019ve been through it all, but I feel like I\u2019ve been through many of the stages that we have where when I started at Jane Street, there were sufficiently I think few people and our infrastructure while developed was sufficiently developing that we were kind of in a stage where the types of studies that we were equipped to do were a lot more crude. But as a result, you could actually understand all stages of the research process very well. You would understand what ideas you\u2019re trying to explore. You would have a very, very expert command of the data analysis tools that you had on hand, which was, I think at the time mostly just a Bloomberg terminal. You would understand very deeply what each column in a dataset meant and what the issues might be and make sure that you have as high quality of a dataset as possible. You would note precisely how to implement a model or what was going into the regression technique that you\u2019re using. And if push came to shove, I think you could just implement that model from scratch and for the production process you would be intimately involved in sort of writing the code to be able to monetize the trade and be able to trade in the market. And for me, I think it was actually extremely educational and nice to be able to be so hands-on with all parts of the process. Obviously I did not do a very good job with any of the parts of this process, and it\u2019s pretty embarrassing if I go back and look at some of the work that I was doing versus what we\u2019re capable of doing now. But just kind of understanding at a very, very deep level what each of these steps takes I think was a very, very good framework for how to understand things as things have gotten a lot more complex and I think capable at Jane Street. So I\u2019m curious now that you just said there are ways in which you learned and the in some sense brutal simplicity of the tool set and the bounds on the complexity of the things that you could do that made it a more useful kind of educational experience for understanding at an intuitive level what was going on with all of this. How do you deal with that when you are responsible for training new researchers and traders who now have a much richer and more complex tool set at their disposal? How do you help them develop that kind of tactile understanding of the markets? I think it\u2019s hard. I do think that in the training and education program that we have, we do try to build it up from the basics as much as possible. I think it\u2019s just very, very difficult for you to understand things at the maximal level of generality from the get-go. My opinion has always been, if you\u2019re trying to understand the concept, the best way to do that is not to read a textbook or read a paper. Oftentimes the notation that you see for math papers is like the most condensed form that you might have or an abstraction of a concept that might have taken many examples to motivate that will allow you to remember that concept if you see this formula. But it\u2019s not the right way to experience things from the get-go. So when we\u2019re teaching new traders about how to think about trading, we intentionally don\u2019t throw them into a, here\u2019s some simulated dollars, please go trade in the market and try to make a good strategy. We intentionally try to distill things down into components and to build up an understanding of why trading dynamics might arise and then incrementally add more parts. So similarly for training up new researchers, anytime that we\u2019re introducing a new topic, we\u2019ll say, Hey, this is a data visualization library that we have. Here is an example plot. Here are some interesting features that we think you should be able to observe with the plot. Really spend 30 minutes with us and try to build some intuition for how to interpret the curves that you might be seeing from this data visualization tool. And I mean, I think that initial trying to orient yourself with a plot can feel pretty slow and very confusing, but down the line when you have to read hundreds and hundreds of these plots rapid fire later on, you kind of need everything to be second nature in terms of how you interpret the results. Having a slowed down fundamentals-based introduction to the tooling is really critical for you to have a fighting chance at keeping up with the rapid stream of information that we have here. I think in general of Jane Street is a place that has absorbed the lesson that tools are really important. In my own work, this has showed up a lot over the years in thinking about tools around software development and we\u2019ve spent an ungodly amount of time just building tools that we think make it easier and better for people to write the software they need to write. You sort of talked about some of the limitations of the early tools of Bloomberg terminals and Excel, which we still use of course those are still important tools. What do you think of tools that have gained more prominence more recently? What are the central tools around research these days? Oh wow. I feel like in every step of the research process that I mentioned, we just have so much more robust tooling that has so many cool features and I just feel very spoiled every time I try to do a research study. Now, anything that I could have done in a week 10 years ago I think would take 10 minutes. Now it\u2019s just wild. Obviously this comes with a complexity burden, but things like if you\u2019re trying to collect data, the types of data that you might want in a financial study includes things like returns or price data where you have thought carefully about corporate actions and what might happen when a company changes its business objective or its ticker or it decides to undergo a stock split. What happens? How do you know what the set of stocks that existed 15 years ago was a classic trap that you could fall under is survivorship bias where you basically say, I\u2019m just going to look at the stocks that exist today, nix out the ones that IPO\u2019d between 15 years ago and now and just assume that\u2019s the universe and that would be a pretty bad way to go about it. But if you were told, I want to know all of the stocks that were trading on the US stock exchanges in 2005, that\u2019s actually a pretty non-trivial task that would take you a while. And we have tooling that can just get it for you with all the annotations and notes that you might want and with some guarantees about accuracy. That\u2019s very cool. You might also want to be able to annotate your dataset with other metadata. What was the market capitalization of this company? What is the volatility of this company? You might also want weird other data that we have that we\u2019re ingesting into our walls that you want associated at the right times with the right symbols. Right? For example, we have our own historical, we\u2019ve computed what we think the values of things are and we\u2019ve just recorded that and made that available for joining into the data sets. Yeah, exactly. And I think we just have a robust network of tooling to be able to do all of these things where the vast majority of traders and researchers here just don\u2019t need to think about the details, and that\u2019s very scary. I think people maybe put a little bit too much faith into the idea that all these tools have been vetted and these are blessed values and people always say the mantra of trust but verify. You should assume that people are doing the best to give you the highest quality data possible, but you should also do your own checks and help make the tooling even better if you find anything that\u2019s a little bit suspect or off with the data that you\u2019re getting. So a lot of the tooling you talked about there is about dataset generation and some of that\u2019s about sourcing data from the outside world and this enormous amount of work we do around that. And some of it\u2019s around infrastructure for slicing and dicing and combining that data in useful ways. There\u2019s also a bunch of stuff in the form of visualization tools. What kind of capabilities are important there? Just things like what events happened in the market at a fidelity and granularity that is greater than what you might get on Bloomberg, which is already pretty granular, but you\u2019re just never going to be able to inspect things at the sub-second level in a particularly satisfying way on Bloomberg. And so we have tools that help us visualize market data and that\u2019s pretty cool. There\u2019s other types of visualization, tooling of graphs and plots are great. I think they\u2019re a lot more easily digestible than numbers on a spreadsheet a lot of times. And a thing that you might want to be able to do is to be able to make arbitrary plots that are both historical or real time of anything that you might ever want to plot. I think having a flexible toolkit for this is an example of a general framework and a tool that exists that I think people have used in very, very creative ways. I think old school Jane Street was like you\u2019d get your data in some Excel spreadsheet and you better not have more than a million data points. You could only fit a million rows in an Excel spreadsheet, and then you literally use the button that gives you a graphing insert a graph tool after you\u2019ve manipulated the data. And we have all sorts of clever recipes that people would learn about, oh, if you wanted this particular kind of plot to visualize this thing, here\u2019s the good way of setting it up. And then you do that and it takes a bunch of manual stuff. And now we have all sorts of really snappy, highly interactive tools where you can dynamically change the parameters and see the plots move in front of your eyes and just makes it really simple and really lightweight and embeds without people having to know it explicitly it makes a bunch of sensible decisions about how to set these kind of visualizations up. Yeah, absolutely. It\u2019s pretty cool. So there\u2019s data tools, there\u2019s visualization tools, there\u2019s also programming tools. Why is Excel great? One of the reasons Excel is great is it\u2019s a data arrangement tool and it\u2019s a programming tool and it\u2019s a visualization tool, but even so it does all those things, but also with some exciting and terrible problems about how it handles each part of that triad. What does programming around research look like these days? An example of, I think things that we\u2019ve sort of built up over time is when you\u2019re trying to do modeling with a dataset, you might want easy access to different types of off-the-shelf models. Maybe these are tree based models or maybe they\u2019re deep learning models or maybe they\u2019re just some artisanal regressions that you\u2019ve cooked up with Carefully biased. Sure. And with various techniques, hacks, things in the loss function that other people at Jane Street have thought about. And so we\u2019ve built up a pretty large and robust library of functions and classes that you can just kind of import and just apply to a dataset that you have that\u2019s in a regularized format for you to be able to iterate through lots of hypotheses of what is the best modeling technique to use on this particular dataset. And that\u2019s pretty cool Where our tool for this used to be mostly Excel. Now our tool for this is largely like everybody else, Python and Python notebooks. Yes. And I think Python notebooks are really great. I think the interactivity and the ability to annotate various cells with things like why the code was written in the way that it was written or dividing things up into sections, I think has just made it a lot easier to share research. It\u2019s also kind of not a framework that was meant for a production system. And so there\u2019s been a lot of, I think, frictions in terms of how to figure out how to bridge people\u2019s enthusiasm in using a Jupyter Notebooks versus their extreme difficulty in wrangling in the end Productionization case. I find Python notebooks kind of great and also super frustrating. One of the things that I understand why people like it, but it also drives me bonkers, is the evaluation model of Python notebooks. Things get evaluated in just whatever damn order you click the buttons, and that\u2019s really bad for reproducibility. It means that you can have had a notebook that looks like it did a thing. If you do it in the order in which things are listed, it just doesn\u2019t work. How did that get there? It\u2019s like, oh, somebody sort of wrote stuff in some reasonable order and at first did things in the right order and then they well made a change to part of it. They didn\u2019t want to rerun the whole thing, so they just went back to the part where they changed things and clicked that button. And it\u2019s just easy to get the notebook into an inconsistent state and there\u2019s no tooling for really knowing whether your notebook is an inconsistent state. That stuff is really awkward. And actually when I think about things that I feel like are pretty painful about, I think our tooling, but maybe research tooling in general is having really good stories around reproducibility it seems like. I think that in some ways feels much better set up on the software engineering side of things like, oh, you\u2019ve got a big repo and there are tests organized in a particular way, and every time you run your continuous integration, it makes sure that all the tests still run. It\u2019s not that I think the people designing this stuff are dumb or something that the python world doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing. There are fundamental reasons why it\u2019s harder on the software side when we do tests in this kind of reproducible way, generally speaking, the tests are pretty fast. It\u2019s okay to run them over and over and as we do more and more trading research and do it at larger scales, you just can\u2019t lightly rerun all the different pieces. It sort of conflicts directly with this desire to have things be lightweight and easy to use. I find the whole ecosystem frustrating, but also don\u2019t know what to do to fix it. It helps when there\u2019s people who kind of straddle the roles. I feel like a caricature that people might have is researchers are these bad scientists with no sense of organization just putting ingredients here and there and throwing things on the wall, and eventually something sticks and then we say, Hey, we want to be able to productionize this thing. And that comes off as extremely frustrating to the folks who at the end of the day help make sure that we get an exciting strategy out into the real world. On the flip side, from the researcher\u2019s point of view and interacting with the developers, it might be like, why is this thing that seems like it should be so easy? I mean, I can just add a column to my dataframe. Why can\u2019t I do this in this production system? And it might feel just weirdly inflexible in a way that just doesn\u2019t really make sense. And I think it\u2019s the tension that we alluded to earlier of having flexibility in being able to explore hypotheses versus having a performant and robust system and that tension is going to remain. Although I think you need that robustness for sure. You need it when you\u2019re going from the, I did some research to I want to productionize it, but also I claim you need it for the research too, because you get to the point of we built this model and we trained it up and we saw what its predictive power was. Oh, and now I want to make one small change to it to see if this change makes a difference. And if you don\u2019t have a good reproducibility story, it\u2019s often very hard to know if you made one small change or if you made six changes because other stuff changed elsewhere in the code base, somebody threw in some more columns and data sources mutated under your feet. So even just purely for the research process, I think this kind of discipline around reproducibility is really important. Totally. And I think this is the type of lesson that needs to be, well, it doesn\u2019t need to be, but it seems like empirically it needs to be learned through hard-won experience. And I think it\u2019s also helpful from an empathy point of view and just us having better tooling to have people who straddle the boundary between doing this research and this robust productionization. And I feel like that\u2019s kind of one of the strengths of Jane Street, which is that we don\u2019t distinguish between these roles in the hard and fast way, and we do have a number of individuals that straddle these roles and help bridge the gap, so to speak, and make sure that things don\u2019t get into the territorial or tribal kind of state. Sure. So part of the story we\u2019re talking about here is the transformation of the kinds of research we\u2019ve done over time where early on tends to be brutally simple techniques, certainly lots of linear regression, and then over time we\u2019ve ended up moving in a direction that looks a lot more like the modeling techniques you see in other places in many ways, and certainly where you\u2019re doing lots of neural nets and tree based approaches and things like that. I\u2019m curious in that environment, we fast forward to the kind of modeling that we\u2019re doing today. What are the challenges you see that are different in the trading context versus what someone who\u2019s doing ML in some other context might see? That\u2019s a good question. I think there\u2019s actually two ways to answer things. So one thing that\u2019s pretty difficult from the point of view of a practitioner is as a person who built up research intuitions from these brutally simple sort of frameworks, there\u2019s some intuitions that you build up about what sorts of things are important. You learn that having priors is important and in cases where you have very low amounts of data, which is often the case when you\u2019re doing some of these simplistic studies, the trade-off that you have is because you are so data limited, you would prefer to not leave that many data points out of sample and just be very careful about the number of hypotheses that you test such that you have a result that you\u2019re going to believe later on that utilizes as much of the data that you have available as possible. In some ways, you can think of this as sloppy data science, but it\u2019s kind of imperative in a lot of the cases of high noise, low data regimes that we\u2019re often operating under in finance. As you go into sort of these larger data sets and more complex modeling techniques, being sloppy with data science is fatal. And so a lot of times people might also be lazy and say, Hey, I understand how these models work in a scenario where this external event happens. Well, we don\u2019t have that many data points to figure out what we would expect to happen as a result of that event. I guess that\u2019s maybe a little bit too vague. Maybe you have a model of how the world is going to work and then something like the global pandemic happens, and how does your model adapt to that? If your model is simple enough and you really understand the story behind why the effect exists, you might have some directional thoughts on how your model should change. And you might even be confident enough to change some of the parameters or coefficients in your model to keep up with this macro event that has happened. And the more you\u2019re dealing with very complex models where you can\u2019t understand the data that you\u2019re putting in, much less sort of like the interaction effects that you are modeling with these very capable and high capacity models, you basically just need to be extremely disciplined about how you approach holding a data set out of sample, having a train set versus eval set and making sure that you\u2019re also not duplicating hypotheses across groups. You might be doing very good and robust data science and believing that you are only believing out of sample results, but if you have a lot of folks at Jane Street who are exploring similar ideas, you might inadvertently be leaking or not doing proper data science in a way that\u2019s kind of scary. You described two approaches. I\u2019m not sure one is less disciplined than the other, it\u2019s just the discipline is in different places. One of them is disciplined in the model space where you\u2019re like Occam\u2019s razor, you want to restrict the universe of hypotheses you\u2019re willing to contemplate in exchange for being able to operate in a reasonably reliable way in very low data circumstances. And then in the high data case now you have much less understanding and introspectability of what\u2019s going on in the models. And so you need to use discipline around data and evaluation in order to control the system. Yeah, that\u2019s a really good way to put it. And one approach is not fundamentally more disciplined than another, but it\u2019s a pretty hard switch for people to make. To the bones I think traders and researchers at Jane Street really want a model to make sense and to be able to have intuitions for how the models are going to change as a result of some event. And unfortunately, the more complex the models get, the more difficult this task is. And I think that\u2019s just kind of like an uncomfortable, I dunno, realization that we\u2019ve had to sort of navigate as our models get more and more complex over the years. And this comes down in some sense to a question of what people often talk about in machine learning context is interpretability, right? And people sometimes talk about interpretability as do I understand what the model is doing? Do I understand why it\u2019s making the decision it\u2019s making? And that\u2019s important. I like your point about going in and maybe you by hand adjust the parameters, which is what I feel like should be called something like interventional interpretability, understanding things well enough so that you can look at a circumstance in the world and look at the model and figure out how do I change the model in order to update to this event? Pandemic\u2019s kind of a great example, like a once in a lifetime, hopefully, Hopefully Thus far once in my lifetime kind of thing. And therefore you don\u2019t get lots of shots. You have an N of one where you have to come in and figure out how to kind of make that change. I mean, in some sense writ large, it\u2019s not really an N of one because there\u2019s a family of different deeply unusual events and you can get good at the process of figuring out how to respond to these deeply unusual events, the need for realtime decision making, being layered into the modeling process. That\u2019s a good example of a kind of unique challenge in the context of trading because trading is so much about realtime decision making and you need the modeling to cooperate. Yeah, I guess we can just go back to your original question of how is machine learning different in a financial context versus in other settings? And I dunno what to tell you, but machine learning in a financial context is just really, really hard. A lot of the things that you might learn in school or in papers or something, they just don\u2019t work. And why doesn\u2019t that work? I think ultimately it boils down to a few pathologies or quirks of financial data. I guess one mental model that I have that I\u2019m borrowing from a coworker that I really liked is you can think of machine learning in finance is similar to building an LLM or text modeling except that instead of having, let\u2019s say one unit of data, you have 100 units of data. That sounds great. However, you have one unit of useful data and 99 units of garbage and you do not know what the useful data is and you do not know what the garbage or noise is. And you need to basically be able to extract a signal in this extremely high noise regime with techniques that were designed for much higher signal to the noise ratio application domains. Why does financial data have so much noise? I think it\u2019s just a very complex system. It\u2019s kind of like millions of people interacting in a simultaneous way to determine what the price of thousands, if not tens of thousands of products is going to be. And so the idea that for any given set model or set of features that you have that you\u2019re only going to be able to explain a very small amount of the variance that you\u2019re trying to explain in which case in this case would be kind of like the returns of a particular instrument. I think it just shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to you. Isn\u2019t there also though a structural thing where the structure of markets basically incentivizes people? When you see regularities in the behavior of prices, you\u2019re incentivized to trade against those and that beats them out of the market. And as things look more and more like martingales or whatever, they look more and more like pure noise. And so in some sense the whole system is designed, the pressures of the system are squeezing out the data and sort of inherently what you have to do in a financial context is look through these enormous streams of data that are mostly now random and find a little bit of remaining signal that you can use. It\u2019s kind of like an efficient markets thing. Yeah, absolutely. And I think you\u2019ve referred to this as the anti inductive property of markets, and I thought that was a great way to describe it Where you sort of go and take the things about the past and remove them from the future actively. Yeah, exactly. I mean, another thing that is quite challenging, if you\u2019re trying to do something like image recognition or digit recognition, the fundamental task that you have there or the dataset that you have doesn\u2019t really change over the decades in financial markets. I guess one thing that I\u2019ve been shocked by is that a financial crisis seems to occur roughly every year. Sorry. When people refer to black swan events or these stock returns are not normally distributed, and there are I think lots of events after which the distribution of features or the returns that you might see in your data just kind of changes and dealing with those regime changes. And it\u2019s not just dealing with days where you\u2019re suddenly dealing with 10 times more data, although you have days like that. It\u2019s just cases where the market just works differently. The world is different. I think being able to deal with those changes while also being able to robustly train a very large model, I think that\u2019s like a challenge that seems pretty unique to the financial domain. The large model thing also connects to a different kind of challenge we have, which is just there\u2019s a lot of data. I mean, I think I was looking before, we get a few tens of terabytes of market data every day. As you said, in some sense, most of it is kind of noisy garbage, but also you have to look over all of it. And being able to process all of that stuff both realtime and historically is challenging. And there\u2019s also the realtime aspect of this is interesting too, because you have to make predictions at various different time horizons. There are trading systems we build where we sweat the performance details down to a range of 10 nanos, more or less is like a material part of our overall time budget. And there are decisions we make which involve humans in the loop thinking about a thing. And those are on much coarser grain. So you have many, many different orders of magnitude at which you have to make predictions. How does that complicate the modeling process, Especially at the shortest timescales? The importance of the eventual inference system that you have and just physical limitations that you have from the speed of light starts to matter a lot. And so one thing that\u2019s been a learning experience for me, I think over the last couple of years is a paradigm that existed I think for research before me, is that roughly the difficult part was the modeling. And that eventually you\u2019d be able to figure out a system where you\u2019re going to be able to produce the predictions that you need. You don\u2019t need to think that hard about the limitations of the hardware that you have. That is just patently not true for some of the models that we\u2019re training these days. Both due to the latency requirements as well as throughput requirements. And I think there\u2019s more and more cases where the way that we approach modeling is not what is the best model for the job, but in first understanding what are the limitations of the hardware that we have and the hardware serving options that we have, and given these constraints, what is the best model that can satisfy these constraints, that can best model the data that we have? I think it\u2019s been fascinating as a person who is somewhat computer illiterate, hardware illiterate to learn about all these systems and to be kind of forced to think about all the interaction effects that matter a lot. Yeah. And the diversity of hardware you\u2019re thinking about is quite high. You might be thinking about evaluating a model on a CPU or on an FPGA or on a GPU, or in fact many different kinds of GPUs and using multiple different kinds of compute units within the GPUs and within the GPU, multiple different kinds of memory and different kind of interconnects between the memory and the host memory and interconnects between the GPUs and each other and the storage systems that you\u2019re using, like the constraints show up all over the place. In some sense, I think of this as a thing that is different in the details in trading, certainly we care about latency at just very different timeframes than the vast majority of people who think about modeling problems, but the general spirit of the hardware matters an enormous amount. I think that\u2019s actually become very broad over the last decade in the kind of machine learning world. When you think about what\u2019s important about the transformer architecture, one version of the story you can tell is the thing that\u2019s really important is it was the thing that evaluated really efficiently on TPUs and GPUs at the time because we learned all these things about scaling laws where as you scaled up the amount of data and the size of the model and the amount of training time, you could just increase the predictive power of the resulting model. And so more than any individual thing about how I would carefully set up and bias and use my priors to make this model match the domain, the thing that matters is can you scale up? There\u2019s a famous paper about the Bitter Lesson in machine learning, which is about all of this stuff about how you carefully set your things up just kind of stops mattering at scale. I\u2019m not like fully \u201cBitter Lesson\u201d-pilled when it comes to all of the things that we do in research around trading. I still think there are lots of places where you\u2019re relatively data poor and I think thinking about priors and the setup of the models and the way in which, in some sense in the places where you\u2019re very data poor, you\u2019re less data poor than you think in that you are drawing intuitions and ideas from other trading situations that you\u2019ve seen over time. But the ability to do that kind of transfer learning where you learned in other places how markets work and you apply it to a new domain is super important. But there are more and more places where we can really make use of scale. And in those cases, yeah, now you suddenly have to have a completely different optimization problem of how am I going to shape the model to match the hardware and even how do I shape the hardware to match the kind of modeling that I want to do? It\u2019s a complicated back and forth, and I feel like the things you were saying about how there\u2019s lots of fluidity between the different domains here and people, both individuals who kind of switch hit and operate in multiple different modalities and just close connections between people who are thinking about different parts of this becomes really important to doing this at a high level. So we\u2019ve talked a bunch about what research was like a long time ago, what research feels like today. I\u2019m kind of curious, what are you thinking about and looking forward to in terms of the future directions of trading related research at Jane Street? It\u2019s very hard to predict. I mean, in a lot of ways I feel like the next couple of years is just going to be especially tumultuous given the developments in AI and the external world. And I think we\u2019ve had developments that are somewhat orthogonal but running in parallel to sort of the developments that you\u2019re going to hear about in the major news outlets. And so I kind of fully acknowledge that whatever predictions that I have about 2025, much less 2026 are just going to be absolutely wrong. That said, I\u2019m very excited about the roadmap that we have for machine learning and research at Jane Street. So over the last few years, we\u2019ve just made tremendous strides in our machine learning capabilities, our understanding of the models and what works in the financial context, our understanding of the hardware that\u2019s required and amassing the fleet of GPUs that we have, which kind of is over the mid thousands of very high end GPUs that we have access to. And that\u2019s very exciting. And by the way, that whole thing requires its own predicting the future, right? One thing that\u2019s hard about buying hardware is you have to make all these guesses about what hardware is going to be in the world in a few years, what are our models going to be shaped like in a few years? And one thing I found exciting about this area is how kind of incompetent we are all the time. Five years ago we were an organization that didn\u2019t know what a GPU was and it\u2019s just dramatically different and it\u2019s kind of an exciting spot to be where you are both landing models in our system that are making a real difference driving a significant amount of P&L. And also you can tell that you don\u2019t know very much because every week you learn a bunch that you didn\u2019t know last week. The learning rate\u2019s incredibly high. It\u2019s very interesting and also very humbling for sure. Yeah, We\u2019re building our modeling capabilities. We continue to consume voraciously and record tens of terabytes of market data as well as other metadata per day. And just I think helping us set the stage for the scale of models that we can fit. And so I think the story of the last couple of years is that we\u2019ve really advanced our capabilities in really being able to make predictions with complex deep learning models, deep neural networks with a variety of data including market data. And I imagine that we will continue to grow in our capacity to make predictions from these models. And I\u2019m pretty excited to see that trend through at least for the remainder of this year, if not further. I think there\u2019s a lot of challenges in terms of domains. What are the ways that we can transfer the understanding that we\u2019ve developed in the asset classes that we have a lot of experience and competence in, and how do we expand that to other domains where due to the relative scarcity of data, the same techniques might not apply? How do we apply transfer learning there and how do we also work with different modalities of data? How do we interleave things like images or text or market data or what have you to really be able to make use of all the information that we have to ultimately be able to make the highest quality price predictions sort of in a financial setting. And the focus of Jane Street I think is in a first class way going to be in terms of how can we be better at trading? How can we provide a better service as a liquidity provider and a participant in the financial markets? But it\u2019s also kind of been cool to see the lessons that we\u2019ve learned in our context of doing research on financial data and how this translates to some of the efforts that you might see in next token prediction like LLM modeling in the world at large. And I\u2019m also curious to see how that\u2019s going to dovetail over the next couple years. It\u2019s maybe worth saying the way in which we use machine learning models varies depending on the kind of thing we\u2019re doing. There\u2019s some kind of stuff that we\u2019re doing where we are trying to extract data that influences trading from the kinds of data sources that people in the outside world routinely build models for and publish data about. And so you might use LLMs or BERT models or whatever to extract data from text and you might use different kinds of models for getting stuff out of geospatial data and other things to get things out of images and whatever. In all of these cases, you can extract data and find ways of making that relevant to your trading decision-making process. And then sometimes what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re looking at the unique time series structured data that comes out of the markets themselves where there aren\u2019t that many papers published about how to do it because mostly the people who know how to do it don\u2019t publish papers about it. And yeah, I think that there\u2019s a lot of excitement these days around new stuff coming out in the LLM space and all this new work on high compute RL and reasoning-style models and being able to take that stuff and see in a kind of multimodal way how this stuff can kind of fit together into models that more comprehensively let you uncover more of the overall trading process. I think the thing that\u2019s maybe not obvious to someone on the outside is in sometimes how all inclusive trading can be. Sometimes you are staring at time series of market data, but you\u2019re also sometimes just trying to think about how the world works because how the world works affects what the asset prices of things should be, and that\u2019s going to affect what our behavior should be. And so as we get more and better models that can do more and bigger things, there\u2019s just like a bunch of opportunities that open up of how we could pour this stuff all into that process. Another thing I\u2019m excited about, which is not about trading exactly, but there\u2019s a ton of work that we\u2019re doing around leveraging ML to just make people more efficient in general, right? We have lots of bizarre and unusual programming languages we use and all sorts of unique internal tools and data sets, and being able to build assistants and agents that can operate on this stuff and help people here be more efficient and get more done is something that\u2019s very exciting from I think all of our perspectives just because the single most important resource here is the people who are coming up with new ideas and doing things, and anything that you can do to grow their scope and what they can achieve is just incredibly valuable. So there\u2019s a lot of ML work of that kind, which is not exactly the thing we\u2019re thinking about in the context of trading related research, but I think helps the organization as a whole a lot. I mean, I think the potential value there is on par with the potential value of some of the other stuff that we\u2019ve mentioned. And I think the pathway to how we\u2019re going to leverage this tooling to really put the most powerful toolkit possible into the hands of Jane Streeters, that path in itself is just, it\u2019s unclear what is the best path to leverage some of these foundation models to fine tune them. What is the set of tooling that we develop in-house versus what we partner with others in? What do we build first? What is the data that we need in order to build these tools? These are all very interesting, I think, and also complex problems that we\u2019re thinking through And in the trading space, we are the people producing, the models we\u2019re using, and it\u2019s a more complicated story in this assistant space where we get to see the cool things that vendors on the outside are doing. And a lot of the work we\u2019re doing in that place can often just be about figuring out how to best leverage and integrate and drive value from those things. And it\u2019s kind of exciting seeing all the new things that are coming down the pipeline from the upstream people who are working on these models as well. Definitely. Alright, well maybe that\u2019s a good place to stop. Thank you so much. Thanks for having me. Again, You\u2019ll find a complete transcript of the episode along with show notes and links@signalsandthreads.com. One thing I wanted to mention is that, as you may have noticed, the pace of releasing new episodes has slowed down a bit. Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re not going anywhere. In fact, we\u2019ve got a bunch of episodes planned that I\u2019m really excited about. Things have been busy, and I do expect the pace to be a bit slower going forward.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Business Insider Edition  BMW is still getting crushed in China \u2014 and now has a brewing trade war to worry about too.          The German carmaker reported on Friday that net profits had collapsed by more than a third last year, and warned that 2025 is likely to be challenging thanks to the ongoing tariff face-off between the US, China, and Europe.               BMW stock fell as much as 4.5% on Friday. As with many of its European rivals, the main source of the automaker's woes is China.               Despite BMW Group's sales rising slightly in the US and Europe, they collapsed 13.4% in the world's largest car market last year.               BMW has found itself increasingly squeezed by China's insurgent local EV makers, who are taking market share from their foreign competitors with their high-tech, affordable electric vehicles.               Fellow German carmakers VW and Porsche have also reported double-digit sales drops in China, even as the likes of BYD and Xiaomi enjoy a sales surge.               BMW plans to roll out a new lineup of next-generation EVs, dubbed the \"Neue Klasse,\" starting later this year in an attempt to boost sales.               It faces the additional headwinds of a brewing global trade war sparked by America's on-again-off-again tariffs on Canada and Mexico.               BMW CEO Oliver Zipse told Bloomberg the automaker expects trade conflicts between the US, China, and Europe to cost it about 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) this year.                However, he expects much of the disruption to be short-lived. \"We don't think that all these tariffs will last very long, though some of them might last longer,\" Zipse said.               Other European automakers are also sounding the alarm about President Donald Trump's tariff barrage. The boss of VW brand Skoda warned on Friday that US tariffs would raise costs, and could push Chinese carmakers to accelerate their expansion into Europe.               BMW did not immediately respond to a request for comment.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"The price of gold surged past $3,000 per ounce for the first time on Friday in a historic rally as traders look for safety in an uncertain market.  Spot gold hit a record $3,004.86 per ounce early on Friday, before paring some of those gains amid trading volatility later in the morning.  Gold is often viewed as a safe haven for investors during periods of high inflation and economic volatility. That\u2019s pushed prices up by more than 12% so far this year, as President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs stoke fears of a recession and slam stocks. The U.S. has levied new tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, threatened additional tariffs on the European Union and the BRICS coalition of nations, and enacted tariffs on all imports of steel and aluminum. As soon as April 2, Trump\u2019s so-called \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs could kick in on other trade partners, including Vietnam and India.  Trump\u2019s latest threat is a 200% tariff on European wine and alcohol, which he proposed as retaliation for the E.U.\u2019s measures hitting back at the steel and aluminum tariffs. China and Canada have both announced their own retaliation for the U.S.\u2019s tariffs, including both tariffs and non-economic actions.  The S&P 500 index fell more than 10% from its recent peak, officially entering correction territory on Thursday, before rebounding slightly on Friday. It was the fastest shift to a correction since the six trading days at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020. The Nasdaq composite climbed 210 points, 1.4%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 263 points, or 0.64%, on Friday after days of declines. \u201cWe aren\u2019t too surprised about the volatility of this magnitude,\u201d said Mike Reynolds, Glenmede\u2019s VP for investment strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the tariffs themselves that have been proposed, it\u2019s that uncertainty that there could be additional levies just around the corner.\u201d Goldman Sachs (GS+1.35%) said last week that the likelihood of a recession within the next 12 months has increased to 20% from 15%. If the White House continues with additional tariffs, the bank said the risk of a recession could increase. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick recently told CBS News that Trump\u2019s trade policies are \u201cworth it,\u201d even if they cause a recession. Central banks have also been purchasing gold as an alternative to the U.S. dollar after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Since then, central banks have doubled their purchases of gold.

And if you\u2019re not signed up, then do so here.   Seeking The Next Big Adaptation  Leafing through the shelves: Experts say around half of what we see on TV is the result of an adapted novel or news article, and the next big adaptation project could have been brewing in the great halls of the London Olympia this week. We were down at the London Book Fair checking things out, keeping ears to the ground of an ever buzzy market that is, nonetheless, experiencing its fair share of hardship. In our primer from Monday, Jesse and I wrote about cautious optimism in the books-to-screen market, with one agent positing that in times of economic volatility big IP wins out. But there was a question as to how many big deals would actually get done, especially considering a number of big-budget adaptations like the BBC\u2019s Shuggie Bain are currently stuck in budgetary limbo. On the ground, in the enormous Olympia, a certain malaise had set in over the dominance of the \u2018romantasy\u2019 genre, with giant billboards advertising the next big \u2018romantasy\u2019 hit above all others. Driven by the ever-popular \u2018Booktok\u2019 corner of TikTok, producers fear that the genre is not a natural fit for adaptation, given how much it costs to build these worlds. Publishers, meanwhile, say the genre represents the lowest common denominator in a market desperate for a bit more literary fiction. \u201cWe need our Baby Reindeer moment,\u201d said one attendee, as she wished for a breakout novel with the raw originality of the award-winning Netflix hit. Yet there were still, of course, plenty splashy novels to discuss. Check out our rundown of the seven buzzy book-to-screen potentials to read more about Adam Kay\u2019s debut, the latest from The Night Agent creator Matthew Quirk and a WME-repped book billed as Emily in Paris\u00a0meets\u00a0The Bear.

Let that sink in. It\u2019s only the sixth title to do so in history. The story behind the film is unusual but there are several noteworthy factors contributing to its success. Firstly, the film is a sequel. The first movie in the franchise was previously the highest-grossing animated film in China at nearly $700M. The sequel was also released during the highly lucrative Lunar New Year period in China, so all signs were pointing towards record box office takings, although perhaps not by this much. Our resident box office expert Nancy theorized earlier this week that a swell of nationalist pride, which included some local companies giving their staff the day off to see the film, ultimately pushed the pic over the edge. The film has now locked a UK and European release through Trinity CineAsia, starting March 14. \u201cAt base, any movie that does well is considered a positive for the industry, and while studio executives we\u2019ve spoken with are gobsmacked by Ne Zha 2\u2019s success, they remain cautious about its true global (read: Hollywood) impact,\u201d Nancy writes. Let\u2019s see if Ne Zha 2 can replicate some of its local heat over here. And in case you\u2019re curious, check out our rundown of the top-grossing animated movies of all time.  \t           SXSW Turns Green  Pot of gold: Huge stars of the big and small screens have been in Austin, Texas this week for SXSW but one person whose attendance may be a bit more surprising was Irish Prime Minister (or Taoiseach) Michael Martin. Anthony D\u2019Alessandro reports that Michael rocked up Monday alongside Cinetic CEO John Sloss, The Astronaut\u00a0filmmaker Jess Varley and Irish producer Tristan Orpen Lynch to share the great experience of not only shooting in the country of leas and cliffs, but also the extremely competitive tax credit. When Ireland\u2019s world-beating tax rebate is placed under the microscope, it perhaps becomes less surprising that Michael took a break from domestic diplomacy to journey down to Austin. Ireland\u2019s tax credit, which will soon rise to 40% on eligible Irish expenditures based on 80% of a pic\u2019s budget, is the envy of the world, especially given the fact it pays 90% upfront to a film or TV series\u2019 budget \u2013 crucial in times of economic volatility. Michael and co talked a packed panel session through a few recent examples (pictured above). While producers pondering where to set their next movie will surely be tempted, this does come at a time when those in Hollywood especially are desperate to bring production back to home shores. How things develop will be fascinating. After SXSW, Michael Martin journeyed to the White House for a meeting with the POTUS. For all our SXSW coverage from the team in Texas, have a gander over here.  Italian TV Market  \u201cUpdated incarnation\u201d: There\u2019s a new TV fest in town, and judging by the first tranche of guests this should be a splashy one. Unveiled at a press conference in Rome yesterday, the Italian Global Series Festival is described as an \u201cupdated incarnation\u201d of the now-defunct Roma Fiction Festival, and will take place in June in Rimini and Riccione. On board from day dot are jury member Bille August, the two-time Palme d\u2019Or winning Danish auteur, and Paolo Genovese (Perfect Strangers), while early awards winners include Evangeline Lilly, Adjoa Andoh and\u00a0Godmother\u2019s Elena Sofia Ricci. Not bad eh? The fest will feature the usual combo of screenings, awards, masterclasses and (hopefully) shindigs. TV markets have very much become a year-round business and the IGSF launches at a particularly busy time in the weeks that events like Seriencamp, NEM and Monte Carlo are taking place. But organizers were bullish that the IGSF can carve its way into the calendar. \u201cIGSF aims to soon become a point of reference and a meeting\u00a0place for the national and international industry,\u201d proclaimed artistic director Marco Spagnoli. In other festival-related news, Kaleem Aftab is stepping down as Director of International Programming at Saudi Arabia\u2019s\u00a0Red Sea International Film Festival. The film writer, critic, programmer and moderator has been part of the festival programming team since its inaugural edition in 2001, when there was still a lot of skepticism and pushback in the wider film world about the event.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"ByMark Johnson  ByMark Johnson , Forbes Councils Member.  Mark Johnson is Cofounder and Managing Partner at Michigan Software Labs.   You are the leader of a middle market company. Things are going fine. Your company is doing a lot of the same stuff it has done before, and you know the drill after having been there for quite some time. You have the same one-on-ones each week with your team and meet with your peers once every other week. You hear about technology trends and read a lot of articles about AI, but it doesn\u2019t really impact your day-to-day. You think, \u201cThat\u2019s good for someone else to be doing, but not us yet.\u201d You attend a few industry conferences and learn about a variety of software product companies that are launching new tools in your industry, but nothing stands out that is ready for your team to pilot yet. You\u2019re asking the right questions in the right order: \u2022 What can we eliminate in our business or steward better? \u2022 What can we automate more effectively? \u2022 How can we start to embed AI in what we do? \u2022 Where can we go faster with AI to serve our customers better? If this sounds like you and your company, you\u2019re not alone. Below are some key considerations for navigating AI adoption and digital transformation in a way that aligns with your business goals. Over the last 15 years, our team has been building digital products and AI solutions for clients in a measurable way. We follow the 10\/20\/70 framework: \u2022 10% selecting the right algorithms. \u2022 20% investing in data and technology infrastructure. \u2022 70% managing the people side of change. This is an exciting time to drive extreme productivity and accelerate time to value. However, success depends on aligning your people to the change. For example, imagine you have a workflow that currently takes 10 days to complete. You know that with the right AI and technology, you could reduce this to just one day. But if the team responsible for approving the results only meets every 10 days, your process remains stuck at a 10-day cycle. The math is simple: 10 - 9 = 1. Even with the best technology, your organization won\u2019t see results unless it\u2019s structured to support the change. That\u2019s why change management is the most critical part of any new initiative. From a business perspective, AI advancements are now happening in days and weeks\u2014not years. This leaves little time for decision making, and the natural tendency is often to do nothing. To stay ahead, we encourage clients to develop a clear strategy by answering three key questions: 1. What should we buy off the shelf? This might include ERP systems, Microsoft Teams or other established software solutions. 2. What should we partner with experts to develop? For example, a custom AI model integrated into a mobile application. 3. What should we build in-house? This could range from cloud capabilities to data governance and other core infrastructure. Governance is key to making AI work effectively. AI tools need the right level of oversight, just as a new employee doesn\u2019t receive full admin access on their first day. Additionally, data quality is critical. The saying \u201cgarbage in, garbage out\u201d applies as much to AI as it does to any business process. Organizations must establish clear data processes and identify the two or three focus areas where high-quality data makes the biggest difference. In many cases, a data cleanup effort is necessary before meaningful AI analysis can even begin. Only one in four companies have achieved success with AI. This is because there are still outdated processes within their enterprise that were not built for the modern way of doing business. As leaders, we often let \u201cperfect\u201d become the enemy of \u201cgood\u201d because the risk of getting it wrong can impact both our company and personal brand. It\u2019s natural to be cautious. To paraphrase Warren Buffett, it\u2019s okay to put all your eggs in one basket\u2014just watch that basket. The key is to put the right AI systems in place, put the right leaders in place and then carefully monitor the basket. That said, AI and automation are not always the best places to start. Before automating, take a step back to simplify and eliminate unnecessary complexity. A streamlined process will always yield better results, whether or not AI is involved. A simple approach to starting that I\u2019d recommend is to engage in a three-to-four-week product strategy phase. Just as you wouldn\u2019t build a factory without first determining its location and purpose, you shouldn\u2019t jump into developing a digital product without a clear roadmap. This phase helps define what success looks like and establishes key milestones. A good goal is to deliver a fully functional version 1 in three to five months\u2014not just a minimum viable product (MVP). While MVPs were once acceptable, today\u2019s users expect real value, efficiency and polish from day one. Many leaders face a \u201cchicken-and-egg\u201d dilemma when launching new projects. They need to prove a business case (path to ROI) to secure funding, but they also need something tangible to demonstrate the project\u2019s potential. This is where a product strategy phase adds value\u2014it helps leaders build a compelling business case using structured, repeatable frameworks. If you are the leader of a middle market company navigating an AI strategy, you are not alone\u2014I hope this helps you.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"     For better focus, less jitteriness and improved gut health, try green tea -- a lower-caffeine alternative to coffee.    Many consider green tea to be one of the healthiest beverages out there. But Americans may prefer to get their caffeine fix from coffee. An estimated 85% enjoy a cup or two every day. The caffeine jolt, however, could be too much for some, causing them to feel jittery and lose sleep. Not only is green tea healthier, but it also has about three times less caffeine than coffee. Should you switch to green tea from coffee? Check out the health benefits that green tea offers to decide which is best for you.\u00a0 Green tea has a long history dating back to about 3000 BC in China. Its beginnings as a medicinal beverage led to green tea becoming one of the world's most popular drinks; the global tea market is now worth over $300 billion. Green tea is an unoxidized tea that comes from the camellia sinensis plant. It grows in Asia, primarily in China and Japan. The tea leaves are plucked and then heated to prevent oxidation and preserve catechins, a natural flavonoid compound with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Leaves are then rolled and dried, though the processing method can differ depending on region. There are six tea types: Green tea is the most widely consumed tea and has the most health benefits, making up around 20% of the global tea production market.\u00a0 Water temperature and steeping time vary by tea type. The ideal way to prepare green tea is to steep it for around three minutes using water at a temperature of 180 to 185 degrees Fahrenheit. Your tea could become astringent from the release of tannins if you use water that's too hot. Consider an electric water kettle that allows you to set the temperature for the best results.\u00a0 A cup of green tea has between 15 to 48mg of caffeine per 8oz serving. The caffeine content goes up if you steep past three minutes, but goes down if you reuse the tea bag. I'm a coffee and tea lover. A typical day used to start with one or two cups of hot, steamy coffee. Then, I would switch to green or herbal tea and water to stay\u00a0hydrated. But I began to notice that I was getting jittery, and my stomach wasn't feeling so great, even with just one cup of coffee. I decided to swap out coffee for green tea to see what would happen to my body. I wasn't as jittery anymore, but I still had focus. \"Thanks to its L-theanine content, green tea provides a more sustained and calm focus, without the jitteriness or crash that some experience with coffee,\" said\u00a0Alison Tierney, board-certified oncology dietician and cancer survivor. My stomach is also feeling a lot better. Tierney mentioned that \"coffee can be harsh on the stomach due to its acidity, while green tea is typically easier to tolerate,\" which I agree with. Dr. Raj Dasgupta, chief medical advisor for Garage Gym Reviews, sums up the benefits I've experienced well: \"Over time, you'll likely notice more stable energy, better hydration and less stomach irritation since green tea is easier on digestion than coffee.\" Looking for a caffeine-free alternative? Check out herbal teas, a blend of herbs, spices and plant material that typically don't contain caffeine (chamomile is one of my favorites). You can also try new teas through a tea club or subscription. Although you can drink green tea for some health benefits, it may also be beneficial in other forms, such as extracts, topical applications and supplements. Check out some of the hidden health benefits of green tea, backed by experts and scientific research.\u00a0 Multiple longitudinal studies suggest that drinking green tea may help you live longer by reducing your risk of disease and all-cause mortality. Almost 500,000 participants in a study published in 2022, with follow-up after 11 years, found that those who drank at least two cups of green tea per day had a lower all-cause mortality risk. Including coffee with tea had similar results. A 2016 cohort study of 6,517 middle-aged and elderly Chinese adults yielded similar findings, particularly among those who had never smoked. Similarly, after a 15-year follow-up of over 164,000 healthy Chinese men, a different 2016 study found that green tea may lower the risk of dying and developing\u00a0cancer and cardiovascular disease. According to a 2019 Japanese study, women who drank one to two cups of tea daily had lower rates of respiratory disease and cancer mortality, and those who drank three or more cups a day had a lower risk of death from all causes, particularly cardiovascular disease. Type 2 diabetes is becoming more prevalent, with as much as 95% of the diabetic population being diagnosed with type 2, according to the CDC. Some studies suggest regular green tea consumption of at least two cups per day may reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. A 2023 meta-analysis of 17 trials shows a potential link between green tea consumption and lower fasting glucose and HbA1c levels. Researchers in a 2019 study of 40- to 79-year-old Japanese citizens found green tea consumption may reduce type 2 diabetes risk by increasing serum ethylamine. A 2020 study in Japan involved nearly 5,000 people with type 2 diabetes. It concluded that drinking two cups of coffee and green tea daily could lower the risk of death compared to drinking only one of the beverages. Green tea compounds, such as epigallocatechin-3 gallate (EGCG) and L-theanine, might help protect against age-related cognitive decline, preserving memory and reducing dementia risk. Middle-aged and older adults who drank green tea at least once a week showed a 64% lower risk of cognitive impairment, according to a 2020 study.\u00a0 A separate 2020 study showed a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers associated with increased Alzheimer's risk. Despite its promise, additional research is necessary to pinpoint the specific green tea compounds that benefit the brain and memory of habitual drinkers. If you're looking to burn fat and build muscle, green tea extract may help. Researchers in a 2021 review determined that green tea consumption may improve weightlifting results more than from exercises alone. A 2013 study found GTE may boost fat oxidation by up to 17% during a moderate-intensity cycling session. \"One of the ways I personally use green tea extract is right before a cardio session,\" said Terry Tateossian, ISSA-certified nutritionist and founder of THOR: The House of Rose, a group and individual wellness coaching company. \"I would keep its use limited to a pre-workout drink that enhances fat burning, endurance, focus and recovery, all while keeping you hydrated and energized,\" Tateossian continued.\u00a0 She recommends a cup of green tea 30 to 45 minutes prior to working out or an extract with 200 to 300mg of EGCG, but lower in caffeine to avoid overstimulation.\u00a0 That said, the conclusion of the 2013 study found that green tea extract may increase fat oxidation at rest better than while exercising, so more research is needed.\u00a0 Green tea extract supplementation may improve lipid and glycemic profiles, reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, according to a 2021 meta-analysis of 55 randomized controlled trials. A 2022 study of 18,609 people showed a link between green tea consumption and a lower risk of heart disease, even in those with high blood pressure. Drinking two or more cups of coffee per day increases the risk of heart disease for people with severe hypertension. Though a 2022 genetic analysis didn't find a correlation between green tea and a lower risk of heart disease, it found it significantly reduces stroke, heart failure and hypertension risks.\u00a0 Loss of bone density, or osteoporosis, makes you more susceptible to breakage, but green tea may help strengthen your bones. Women over 50 are most likely to develop osteoporosis. Green tea is high in antioxidants, which may improve bone formation and preserve volume and thickness, according to a 2011 review of rat studies.\u00a0 A 2017 meta-analysis of 17 studies found that green tea polyphenols may limit bone loss, especially in women who don't drink alcohol or smoke. One 2009 study suggests that green tea may help prevent osteoporosis by balancing out bone metabolism and reducing the chance of bone loss before it begins, though more human studies are needed.\u00a0 According to the Stroke Awareness Foundation, strokes affect almost 800,000 Americans per year, with around 140,000 deaths annually. Consuming green tea regularly may reduce your risk of a stroke. A 2009 meta-analysis of nine studies found that consuming three or more cups of green tea daily can reduce your risk of stroke by 21%. An ischemic stroke blocks blood supply to the brain and accounts for around 87% of strokes, according to the American Stroke Association. A 2012 meta-analysis of 14 studies found that drinking at least three cups per day reduced the risk of ischemic stroke by as much as 13%. In a large 2013 cohort study of over 82,000 Japanese people, researchers found that drinking at least four cups of green tea or two cups of coffee per day reduced stroke risk by 20%. A 2019 study of more than 46,200 people over 18.5 years found that between one and six cups of green tea daily lowered death risk post-stroke or heart attack. For those without stroke or heart attack history, green tea and coffee consumption improved outcomes compared to non-drinkers. Green tea has the highest concentration of the amino acid L-theanine compared to other teas, which may help lower your anxiety and stress levels.\u00a0 In a 2017 study of 20 students, those who drank low-caffeine green tea were found to have a lower stress response than the placebo group. Another 2017 study of middle-aged individuals also found lower stress markers in the green tea group, which also improved their sleep quality compared to the placebo group.\u00a0 In a 2019 RCT of 30 people who were supplemented with 200mg of L-theanine per day for four weeks, the supplement group had lower anxiety and stress scores and higher cognitive function scores than the placebo group. Keep in mind, though, that the average cup of green tea has around 15mg of L-theanine.\u00a0 Full of antioxidants and protectant compounds, green tea has a long history of providing a wide range of health benefits. Regular consumption of two or more cups per day may reduce your risk of disease, enhance fat burning and help you live longer. If you're considering cutting down on your coffee consumption, you may want to switch to green tea.\u00a0","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Business Insider Edition  Four ex-employees of a lithium startup bankrolled by Bill Gates' climate investment firm have sued the company, accusing it of \"recklessly\" exposing them to toxic chemicals that left them sick and injured.          The former workers at Lilac Solutions say in a 60-page lawsuit they were fired after they repeatedly sounded the alarm to upper management about their \"overexposure\" to hazardous dust and fumes inside a poorly ventilated Oakland, California, warehouse.               Lilac hit back against the ex-employees with its own lawsuit in late January, alleging the ex-workers \"intentionally misappropriated\" the startup's trade secrets through their public court filings.               The company, which has said it raised more than $165 million in funding led by Gates' climate investment firm Breakthrough Energy Ventures, developed new technology to extract lithium, a crucial material in electric car batteries.           Gates is not personally affiliated with the lithium company. His investment firm is not named in the ex-workers' lawsuit.                A previous Business Insider review found companies are using trade secrets law as a legal strategy against workers who have accused them of wrongdoing.               Nick Yasman, an attorney with West Coast Trial Lawyers who represents the former employees, told BI that Lilac's countersuit is a \"pressure tactic to scare\" his clients into backing down, and called the suit \"utterly unmeritorious.               A Lilac spokesperson, though, told BI that \"the allegations against the company are completely without merit.\"                \"Lilac Solutions will vigorously defend itself and its employees in this lawsuit, and we are confident that the legal process will vindicate us from these baseless allegations,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our focus remains on delivering industry-leading technology that unlocks faster, cheaper and cleaner lithium production to meet growing industry demand.\"               The former employees' lawsuit against Lilac alleges that the company \"sacrificed human health and safety in pursuit of its goals.\"               Plaintiffs Michael Mitchell, Khiry Crawford, Tyler Echevarria, and Anthony McCune worked out of Lilac's Oakland processing plant, assisting in the manufacturing of tiny ceramic ion exchange \"beads\" used in the company's process to extract lithium from brine, the lawsuit, filed in late November in California's Alameda County Superior Court, says.                The beads or ion exchange material, referenced in court papers as \"IXM,\" \"was comprised of many different toxic and hazardous chemical compounds,\" says the lawsuit, which highlights a specific chemical compound, only identified as \"Compound A,\" containing \"a toxic chemical\" only referred to as \"Chemical 1.\"               \"While Compound A can be a benign material at small exposure levels, significant exposure to Compound A can lead to high levels of Chemical 1 in the human bloodstream,\" the lawsuit says. \"High enough concentrations of Chemical 1 in the bloodstream can lead to Chemical 1 poisoning, which is a toxic condition caused by overexposure or chronic exposure to Chemical 1.\"               The plaintiffs allege Lilac stored its stock of \"Compound A\" in torn bags that were \"carelessly\" piled on the warehouse floor, allowing particles to escape into the air.               Test results eventually confirmed that the ex-employees were \"actively being exposed to toxic and dangerously high levels of Chemical 1 every work day,\" the lawsuit says.               Prior to their employment at Lilac, the lawsuit says the plaintiffs were physically healthy. Yet when they were at the company and after they left, they experienced symptoms including severe respiratory pains, coughing, difficulty breathing, abnormal gastric pains, loss of balance, nervous system tremors, uncontrollable shaking in their hands and limbs, severe insomnia, anxiety, and depression, their lawyers allege in the complaint.               The plaintiffs say that throughout their employment with Lilac from 2021 to 2024, they were \"regularly warned by colleagues about the danger of the materials they worked with,\" but were provided with \"extremely minimal and grossly insufficient personal protective equipment.\"               The ex-workers say in the complaint their physical injuries were \"substantially caused by LILAC's willful concealment of the identities of many toxic chemicals,\" as well as arsenic.                The former employees allege that their desks and workspaces were \"constantly\" covered in chemical dust and engulfed by fumes and that the \"toxicity was inescapable.\"               As early as 2021 and through January 2024, the employees complained to management about the \"grossly insufficient\" ventilation system in the warehouse, the lawsuit says.               \"Despite Plaintiffs complaints, LILAC took no measures to increase ventilation and air purity within its warehouse until January 2024, after Plaintiffs were terminated,\" it says.               On January 16, 2024, the workers were notified of their terminations and told it was the result of a \"reduction in force,\" the lawsuit says.               The lawsuit argues that the plaintiffs' complaints about workplace health and safety and \"whistleblower complaints\" about Lilac's \"noncompliance with state and local health and safety codes and regulations, substantially caused and contributed\" to the company's decision to end their employment.               The lawsuit alleges California labor code violations, whistleblower retaliation, negligence, and discrimination.               \"It's a whistleblower retaliation case where the people who complained the most were the same ones who were fired,\" Yasman told BI.               After their firings, the plaintiffs filed complaints of retaliation against Lilac with California's Labor Commissioner's Office and complaints with the state's Division of Occupational Safety and Health, resulting in OSHA issuing Lilac four citations, the lawsuit says.               Lilac filed its countersuit against the ex-employees on January 31, calling it \" a case of clear and intentional misappropriation of trade secrets\" in court papers.               The former workers, Lilac's lawsuit says, \"gained access to Lilac's trade secret information relating to the chemicals and processes Lilac uses to manufacture certain ceramic beads.\"               It's a process that \"none of its competitors do, know how to do\" or were aware that Lilac does, the lawsuit says.               The lawsuit, which also alleges breach of contract, says the ex-employees were made aware that the chemicals and processes used to manufacture the so-called \"IX beads\" were \"highly confidential and that they were not permitted to be disclosed to anyone outside of Lilac.\"               Lilac alleges that the company \"has been and continues to be irreparably harmed\" as a result of the ex-workers' \"misappropriation of its trade secrets.\"               Its lawsuit says a draft of the former workers' legal complaint included repeated references to \"Chemical 1,\" which the company describes in the court papers as \"the most important chemical in the manufacturing of the IX Beads.\"                Yasman, during an interview with BI, argued that the trade secrets Lilac has alleged can be found on the company's own website or in publicly filed patents.               The attorney and his team have filed a special motion to strike the case under California's anti-SLAPP law that's designed to curb meritless lawsuits and protect free speech rights.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Business Insider Edition  Good morning. Have you ever had a paintball gun let loose on your vehicle? No? You must not own a Cybertruck then. BI spoke with 10 Cybertruck owners about what it's like driving the most controversial vehicle in the world.          In today's big story, we're looking at when the stock market sell-off could force President Donald Trump to drop his trade war.       What's on deck   Markets: Ross Gerber predicted Tesla's stock crash. Now he's doubling down.       Tech: After 10 weeks of Amazon's full RTO, some employees feel energized. Others quit.       Business: State and local governments across the US are looking to adopt their own DOGE.               But first, when is enough, enough?       If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.   When will the losses become too steep to ignore? It could be soon.           Trump's unflinching pursuit of his protectionist agenda has come at a cost: The S&P 500 officially entered a correction on Thursday, down 10% from its February peak.               So far, Trump's team has shown that they're willing to tolerate stock market pain \u2014 but at some point, that pain may become unbearable.               Marko Papic, the chief strategist at BCA Research, thinks Trump might not be far away from his breaking point. He said a 15% to 20% decline in the S&P 500 could force the president to start walking back his trade war.               Economist Desmond Lachman, meanwhile, says the issue is less about a specific drop and more about how quickly and severely the sell-off unfolds: \"What's occurred over the last couple of weeks, if that continues at this kind of pace, he'll have to cave.\"               As BI's William Edwards writes, with top earners propping up consumer spending, a significant stock market decline could start to weigh on their willingness to open their wallets.       Investors can blame the trade war.           The latest development came on Thursday when Trump threatened a 200% tariff on wine and other alcohol products coming from the EU \u2014 a retaliatory measure against the EU's new tariffs on $28.4 billion worth of US goods that included a quintessential American drink: whiskey.               Businesses, from wine shops to restaurants, are now on the rocks. One couple who run an Italian-Croatian restaurant told BI that they're alarmed: \"How does an Italian restaurant pivot away from European wine?\"       1. An early Tesla investor-turned-bear doubles down. In late February, Ross Gerber predicted Tesla stock would drop 50% this year. Since then, the stock has tanked. BI followed up, and Gerber doesn't think a rebound is on the horizon.       2. The S&amp;P 500 is officially in a correction, and all signs point to the trade war. The prevailing view is that President Trump's tariffs have rocked investor confidence and triggered recession alarm bells. Following the announcement of a 200% tariff on alcohol from the EU, the S&P 500 finished Thursday 10% down from last month's peak.       3. But JPMorgan thinks the worst is over. The bank thinks a corner of the hedge fund sector \u2014 not recession fears \u2014 may be to blame for the market's recent weakness. Now that equity quant funds have reduced their positions, the worst of the correction may be over, it said in a recent note.       1. Checking in on Amazon's RTO rollout. It's been 10 weeks since the tech giant instituted its five-day return-to-office mandate. Eleven employees told us how they're doing \u2014 including two who quit.       2. Did Apple bite off more than it can chew? The tech giant doesn't tend to overpromise and underdeliver, but some onlookers are noticing a shift. Apple teased some glitzy AI features back in June, but they haven't come to fruition. BI's Peter Kafka broke down Apple's game of catch-up.       3. Meta is trying to silence a former executive. She told BI why. Sarah Wynn-Williams made headlines this week when she released her explosive memoir detailing her time at Meta. BI sat down with the \"Careless People\" author hours before an arbitrator ruled in Meta's favor, barring Wynn-Williams from promoting it.       1. Little DOGEs everywhere. Republican and libertarian leaders in at least 18 states are copying Elon Musk's slash-and-burn playbook. They've even adopted quirky names, too. (Hello, GOAT and FLOGE.) Meanwhile, the OG DOGE is hiring more staff to pore over death records in search of benefits fraud.       2. Would you rather: PIP or severance? That's the choice some TikTok staffers face after receiving low-performance review scores. Three current employees told BI they thought accepting a performance improvement plan over severance was rare because it's challenging to survive one.       3. You may be footing Big Tech's electricity bill. Companies building data centers are striking secretive electricity deals with utilities, potentially raising the average American's bills, Harvard researchers found. But it's hard to know the exact price tag when the contracts are hidden from the public.       The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave).

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"The BBC has heard evidence of atrocities committed by retreating fighters in a battle raging for control of Sudan's capital city Khartoum. The city has been held by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) since the start of the country's brutal civil war nearly two years ago - but the army has retaken much of it and believes it is on track to seize the rest. Regaining the capital would be a tremendous victory for the military and a turning-point in the war, although by itself would not end the conflict. In recent weeks troops have mostly encircled Khartoum, coming up from the south after surging through central Sudan, and clearing city districts in the north and east, squeezing the remaining RSF fighters into the centre. Vast areas of the reclaimed territory are completely destroyed. Travelling with the army, we drove past block after block of damaged and ransacked buildings - some of them blackened by fire, many pockmarked with bullet holes. The pavements in front of them were littered with vandalised vehicles, pieces of discarded furniture, the soiled remains of looted goods and other debris. But even in places that look untouched, the terror is fresh. In Haj Yusuf, a district of Khartoum east of the River Nile, residents described chaos and violence as fleeing RSF fighters turned on civilians. \"It was a shock, they came suddenly,\" says Intisar Adam Suleiman. Two of her sons, 18-year-old Muzamil and 21-year-old Mudather, were sitting by the house with a friend. The RSF soldiers ordered them inside, then shot them in the back as they entered the gate, says Ms Suleiman. Muzamil escaped with a bullet wound in his leg but \"our friend died instantly\", he told me. \"Then the men wanted to enter the house, and my mother tried to hold the door shut, pushing and pushing. They spotted a phone on the ground, grabbed it and left. I went and called the father of my friend so he could come and do first aid, but we couldn't rescue him.\" Mudather died the next morning because the hospital's blood bank had been decimated by a long power outage and he could not get the transfusion he needed. Ms Suleiman says she knew the RSF soldiers and had engaged with them before to try and de-escalate violence. One of them had told her: \"We came for death, we are people of death.\" She says she told them: \"If you came for death, this is not the place for death.\" Yet too much death is what Ms Suleiman has seen in this war.  So many people have died, she says: \"I've become used to these traumas.\" A few blocks away, Asma Mubarak Abdel Karim tells me she and a group of women got caught up in the fighting as Sudanese forces closed in. She says they were confronted by retreating RSF soldiers who accused them of siding with the military because they had been to a market in army-held territory. \"They shot on the ground around us, around our feet, terrifying us,\" she says, explaining how they then pulled one woman into an empty house and raped her. She says the RSF fighter held the woman at gunpoint and told her: \"Come with us.\" He was beating her with his weapon, says Ms Karim. \"And then we heard shooting and the man ordering her to: 'Take it off! Do this! Do that!' Then the fighting around us intensified and we couldn't hear any more - bullets were falling in the area, so we hid inside the house.\" She wipes away tears when asked what the best thing about the situation is for her now. \"Security,\" she says softly, \"the best thing is security. They tortured us so terribly.\" An RSF spokesman denied the reports, saying the group had controlled this area for two years \"without any major crimes\" and that \"massive killings\" had been reported in areas taken by the military. The army and allied militias have been accused of carrying out widespread atrocities after recapturing territory, in particular the central Gezira state. The UN and US say both sides have committed war crimes, but singled out the RSF for criticism of mass rape and accusations of genocide. It is not only the RSF foot soldiers who are on the move. Top officials have abandoned their homes in the nearby affluent suburb of Karfuri. The RSF elite had embedded itself into Khartoum's establishment before the paramilitary group and the army turned on each other in April 2023 in a battle for control. Karfuri is now eerily empty and thoroughly looted. Even the house of the RSF's deputy commander, Abdel Rahim Hamdan Dagalo, and brother of the group's leader, was not spared. The big empty swimming pool in the yard is scattered with rubbish. Sofas in the spacious rooms are overturned, the windows broken, gold jewellery boxes are bare, the door of a waist-high safe has been pulled off. The army says it believes that most of the RSF senior leadership is now outside the city, and that those still fighting for the heart of Khartoum are the junior commanders and lower-ranking soldiers. We were told the military was using drones to drop leaflets urging remaining fighters to leave rather than fight street by street. The samples we were shown are written in Arabic but also French, apparently directed at foreign fighters from neighbouring Chad. \"Lay down your weapon, change into civilian clothes, and leave the area to save your life,\" says one. In Khartoum North, closer to the Nile, the RSF was pushed out several months ago, but the calm is regularly punctured by the sound of shelling as the army fires at the group's positions across the river. Many people here say they finally feel safe enough to sleep at night but are still taking stock of extensive damage. Zeinab Osman al-Haj showed me the wreckage of her house, telling me the RSF fighters would come at night and break down the door if she didn't open it. \"They filled their backpacks, and even my food supply, my sugar and my flour and my oil, the soap, they took it,\" before eventually burning the house down, she says. \"This was not a war,\" she says, pointing at the pile of ashes where her brother-in-law's library once stood, the charred bedframes in the ruined bedrooms. \"This was chaos: there was theft and stealing and robbery, that's it.\" A few streets down we meet Hussein Abbas. He is nearly 70 years old, walking with a cane and dragging a battered suitcase down an empty street toward a skyline of burned and gutted buildings. He tells us he has been displaced three times since leaving the capital seven days after the war began. \"The moment I got off here I almost cried,\" he says, as tears begin rolling down his cheeks. \"For two years, two years I haven't seen this place. We suffered a lot, extreme suffering.\" Survivors like Mr Abbas are slowly returning to try and salvage their homes. The army has the upper hand now in this terrible war, but there is much suffering still to come for Sudan's people. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"ByAdam Sarhan  ByAdam Sarhan , Contributor.  NEW YORK, NEW YORK - OCTOBER 04: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during ... [+] morning trading on October 04, 2023 in New York City. The market opened up slightly high amid the release of the ADP employment report after all three major indexes closed dropping over 1% with the Dow Jones dropping 425 points.  (Photo by Michael M. Santiago\/Getty Images) U.S. fell again this week but we had another late week rally that erased some of the losses. This also happened on the past two Fridays. However, in both cases, stocks fell hard on Monday and erased Friday\u2019s big rally and then some a few days later. Will it happen again on Monday? Only time will tell. Earlier today we had disappointing consumer sentiment data which normally is bearish, but instead of falling, stocks rallied. Typically, it\u2019s a good thing to see the market rally on bearish news. Let\u2019s take a look at the major events that happened this week. Correction Territory:  Normally, a pullback is defined as a decline of 1-10% below a 52-week high. A correction is defined as a decline of 10-20% and a bear market is anything that is over 20%. The benchmark S&P 500 officially hit correction territory on Thursday, falling 10% from its 52-week high. However, Friday\u2019s big rally put it back in pullback mode as it is now 8% below its 52-week high. However, the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) is in correction territory and is 11% below its 52-week high. The smaller and mid cap indices are also in correction territory. The small-cap Russell 2000 and mid-cap S&P 400 are both down 17% and 14%, respectively. That means most of the market is in a correction and the small cap stocks are very close to hitting the -20% bear market threshold. Super Oversold  Just about any technical or sentiment level you look at will show you that this market is super oversold and way overdue to bounce. Near term, the bulls want to see the major indices rally and get back above their respective 200 day moving average lines. Meanwhile, the bears want to see the market roll over and have another leg down. Exaggerated Moves:  It is important to note that in downtrend (present market included) we tend to see exaggerated moves both up and down. Right now the market is in a downtrend and we can easily see big wild swings both up and down. Week In Review:   The week began with a thud. On Monday, stocks tanked their lowest levels in six months, driven by relentless tariff news from President Donald Trump and growing fears of an economic slowdown. Investors dumped stocks as fear spread that we are heading into a recession. The sell-off erased more than $4 trillion from the S&P 500\u2019s market value since its February peak. Stocks fell again on Tuesday after Trump doubled down on his tariff rhetoric. However, later in the day, U.S. and Canadian officials signaled plans to de-escalate tensions through talks scheduled for this week. Stocks rallied nicely on Wednesday after a cooler-than-expected consumer inflation report for February showed inflation was slowing. That didn\u2019t last long because sellers showed upon Thursday and undercut Wednesday\u2019s low erasing a chance for a new rally to unfold. The selling came after Trump said there might be new duties that will take effect on April 2. Stocks bounced sharply on Friday after consumer sentiment fell to its lowest levels in years. Gold, Silver, & China, & International Stocks: In other news, I am seeing the big money flow into international equities and gold\/silver. China\u2019s stock market is acting very well and so are many Chinese stocks. Other international equity markets are acting well as the US stock market pullsback. Gold hit a new record high and topped $3,000 an ounce, reflecting a flight to safety that has intensified as US stocks fall.   After two years of robust gains fueled by AI optimism and a resilient U.S. economy, Wall Street is now contending with a starkly different landscape. Trump\u2019s tariffs, coupled with softer corporate earnings outlooks from many retail stocks, like Wal-Mart, Kohl\u2019s Corp., Dollar General Corp., etc has caused investors to worry about a weaker consumer. Even some analysts on Wall Street are cutting their growth estimates for the broader economy. Goldman Sachs analysts slashed their 2025 GDP forecast to 1.7% from 2.4%, citing \u201cthe tax-like effect of rising tariffs, elevated uncertainty, and tightening financial conditions.\u201d Morgan Stanley\u2019s team went even lower, projecting 1.5% growth.What\u2019s Next: The Fed, Earnings, and More Tariff Talk  As investors look forward, the focus shifts to a few catalysts that could either stabilize markets or deepen the decline: The Federal Reserve\u2019s next moves, a fresh batch of economic data, Russia Ukraine Peace talks, and the ongoing trade war.  The Fed has its next meeting next week. The Fed\u2019s two day meeting will finish on Wednesday with a rate decision and updated economic projections expected after the meeting. Markets are pricing in a quarter-point cut to the benchmark rate, currently at 4.25%-4.5%, following softer labor market data and this week\u2019s tame inflation print. Barclays expects two cuts in 2025, though some economists now see the Fed starting as early as June if tariff-driven uncertainty persists. Investors will be laser-focused on Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s press conference for clues about how the central bank views the trade war\u2019s economic toll. \u201cThe Fed is in a tough spot,\u201d said Hooper. \u201cThey can\u2019t ignore the tariff noise, but they also don\u2019t want to overreact to what\u2019s still a hypothetical risk.\u201d   Economic data will also take center stage. Tuesday\u2019s retail sales report for February will offer a window into consumer health. That\u2019s going to be important because many people are worried about the health of the consumer. In fact, the XRT which is a popular ETF that tracks retail stocks is in a private bear market and has been falling hard recently. Investors will also want to know if the ongoing tariff headlines are squeezing household budgets. Any upside surprises could bolster hopes of a soft landing; downside misses might reignite recession fears. In other news, investors will be looking for the latest developments from the Russia Ukraine war, the Trade War, and any other headline that hits the wires. The first quarter is almost over and then we have the April 2 deadline right around the corner.   For now, Wall Street is in wait-and-see mode. Friday\u2019s rally shows resilience, but there is still a lot of technical damage that needs to be repaired. One thing is for sure, it\u2019s never a dull moment on Wall Street.","label":1}

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Is Intel finally on the up?  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Intel's numerous woes in the last, well, decade or so are thoroughly documented. So, it's nice to be able to report some good vibes. Its share price leapt nearly 15% yesterday, primarily in response to the appointment of new CEO Lip-Bu Tan. Meanwhile, an engineering manager at Intel posted some celebratory images from the company's Arizona fab marking an \"Eagle has landed\" moment for the crucial 18A node, an indication the new node might already be in mass production. I as tap these words out, Intel's share price sits at $23.88, over 20% higher than the circa $19.50 it was trading at on Tuesday. That's still a long way of the $65-plus level it hit in April 2021 and also well below the $42 it hit way back in 2000. Long story short, Intel has a long way to go yet if we can say it's turned any sort of corner. Indeed, by the estimates of most financial experts, Intel's break up value, or how much money you'd net by breaking the company up and selling all its assets to the highest bidder still comfortably exceeds its current market cap, or its current overall valuation based on its share price. Whenever a break up value exceeds market cap, it's an indication that the markets are pessimistic about the company's prospects. So, in net terms, that remains the case today, even after a double-digit bump in the stock price. But up is up, and Intel is definitely on the up this week.  But what of that 18A moment? Inevitably, the Linkedin post in question seems to have already been taken down. But not before it was captured by several observers. In it, Intel engineering manager Pankaj Marria posted an image of a group of engineers in front of an 'Eagle has landed poster' and commented, \"proud to be part of the Eagle Team, leading the way in bringing Intel 18A technology to life! Our team was at the forefront of running the initial lots right here in Arizona, marking a key step in advancing cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. He also added, \"the Eagle has landed, and this is just the beginning! Developed and Made in America the World\u2019s smallest Node.\" Several observers are taking Marria's comment of \"running the initial lots\" to mean that mass production had started. Frankly, it's hard to know if that's a reasonable interpretation of the Linkedin post. But at the very least, there seems to be clear positivity inside Intel about the health of 18A. And that is a very, very good thing for not only Intel itself, but the chip industry as a whole. Currently, TSMC dominates the customer chip manufacturing market in terms of cutting-edge silicon. That's made access to TSMC's fabs critical, it's pushed up prices, and arguably lead to the current situation where it's hard to find a decent graphics card to buy, never mind how much you'll have to pay for it. Intel is planning to take on TSMC directly with its 18A node, offering it to everyone from Nvidia to AMD as an alternative manufacturing solution. If 18A succeeds, it will relieve much of that pressure, industry wide, and might (just might!) help return the GPU market to something approaching normality. Intel is also planning on using 18A for its next-gen Panther Lake mobile and Nova Lake desktop CPUs. No doubt if 18A really is killer, it could be used for a future Intel GPU architecture, such as Celestial or Druid. Long story short, 18A is crucial. Go, 18A, go! Please...

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"Business Insider Edition  In an appearance on a podcast last year, Mark Zuckerberg basically said he was done explaining the past. Faced with a new book full of damning allegations, Meta is now doing just that \u2014 going all out to push back against a former employee's book.          It's possible that this strident defense is backfiring \u2014 creating a \"Streisand Effect\" that's publicizing the book even more.               Here's the quick version of the drama so far:               Sarah Wynn-Williams worked at Facebook from 2011 to 2017 \u2014\u00a0and her book, \"Careless People,\" details what she said were a bunch of bad things the company did. It also contains allegations that Joel Kaplan \u2014 who is now Meta's chief global affairs officer \u2014 sexually harassed her. (Meta said this week that Kaplan had been cleared of the harassment allegations in 2017 after it investigated Wynn-Williams' complaint.)               The book was released with hardly any pre-publishing fanfare: It was announced by its publisher, Flatiron Books, an imprint of Macmillan, only a few days before it came out Tuesday. That's an unusually short timeline.               Meta's reaction has been emphatic and multi-pronged. The company created a page on its website that detailed a series of the claims in the book. It said some of these \u2014 like claims about its ambitions in China or its alleged failure to act in Myanmar\u2014 have already been reported in the news media as far back as 2017 and have been acknowledged by the company publicly. The company lists seven \"new\" claims from the book and then offers links to past coverage and company responses \u2014 calling the claims \"old news.\"        View on Threads           Meta's strongest move was on Wednesday when it won a ruling in arbitration that said Wynn-Williams could no longer promote the book because of a non-disparagement clause in a contract she signed as an employee.\u00a0The ruling was granted on an emergency basis and is temporary pending the completion of the full arbitration process, The Washington Post reported.               The ruling created a new set of headlines \u2014 and some people on social media were saying news of the arbitration was the first they were hearing about the book. They now wanted to read it.               (The book's publisher said the arbitration ruling had no impact on Macmillan itself and the book is still for sale online. In a statement, the publisher it was \"appalled\" by what it said were Meta's tactics to \"silence our author.\")               Business Insider's Pranav Dixit interviewed Wynn-Williams the day before the arbitration ruling. She told Dixit that Meta is \"trying to smear me and convince people not to read the book. People should read the book. The truth is in the book. They can make up their own minds. I stand by everything in the book.\"       Read more:   Meta is trying to silence a former executive. In an interview, she tells BI why.   Mark Zuckerberg once said his favorite president was Andrew Jackson because he was a ruthless populist who got stuff done, new book says   Xi Jinping used 'a human Chinese wall' of soldiers to block eye contact between him and Mark Zuckerberg, new book says           A spokesperson for Meta gave this statement: \"This book is a mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives. Eight years ago, Sarah Wynn-Williams was fired for poor performance and toxic behavior, and an investigation at the time determined she made misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment. Since then, she has been paid by anti-Facebook activists and this is simply a continuation of that work. Whistleblower status protects communications to the government, not disgruntled activists trying to sell books.\"               As for me, someone who closely follows Meta news? Sure, some of the things in \"Careless People\" were familiar. (I have even written about some of them.) Some of the things I had nearly forgotten or didn't know much detail about, like Meta's negotiations with China (of course, in the end, Meta didn't end up operating there).               But the point of a book like this isn't scoops, necessarily. It's about reading the point of view of an insider who can provide context and create a narrative story \u2014 take it or leave it. As a reader, you get to be the judge. And that's interesting! That's, you know, \"books!\"               People who are interested in Meta, and its people, probably will be interested in this for the same reason a Mtley Cre fan \u2014 after reading \"The Dirt,\" a history of the group, will also want to read the individual autobiographies of Tommy Lee, Vince Neil, and Nikki Sixx.               You might also continue to enjoy the oral history \"Nthin' But A Good Time: The Uncensored History of the '80s Hard Rock Explosion,\" the memoir of video vixen Bobbie Brown, or the memoir of the guitarist of Hanoi Rocks, whose bandmate died in a car crash with Vince Neil. Heck, you might even watch the movie version of \"The Dirt\" (it's not very good, unfortunately) \u2014 or better yet get some context of the rock scene of the time from the documentary \"The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years.\"               The point is: I can promise you that if there is a topic that interests you, whether it's '80s hair metal or the inner workings of one of the most powerful companies on earth, you will still get something out of a book on the topic, even if it's \"old news\" \u2014 be that Facebook's attemptsto crack the lucrative China market or stories about Ozzy Osbourne snorting ants.               Apart from the headline-grabbing claims, \"Careless People\" bills itself as an insider's perspective on a series of tiny moments from a specific period. It paints a picture of a company whose leadership was possibly somewhat ill-prepared to operate on the global stage and hasn't fully reckoned with its power.               It's a company whose business goals sometimes conflicted with doing the right thing for humanity, where there were often internal debates about what even was the right thing for humanity.               I don't think even Meta's strongest supporters would disagree with that assessment.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

So much for the \u201cTrump Bump.\u201d With the new administration on a tariff-tear this week, the markets were spooked about a recession and crypto was not immune.  Still, progress in digital assets was all around, and our reporters reported it all with alacrity. BlackRock\u2019s bellwether BUIDL fund topped $1 billion and tokenized treasuries hit $4.2 billion, Kris Sandor reported. MoonPay, a payments aggregator, made an important stablecoin acquisition, Will Canny wrote. Ripple won a payments license in the UAE (Shaurya Malwa). OKX won a license to operate in Europe, Camomile Shumba reported. Coinbase announced plans to offer 24\/7 futures trading in the U.S., Helene Braun reported.  There was also big regulatory news. The U.S. House voted to overturn the IRS\u2019s controversial \u201cbroker rule\u201d in a big win for DeFi operators. And a Senate committee voted to send the GENIUS stablecoin bill to the floor, ahead of probable approval there.  The Trump Family continued to be front-and-center in the crypto news. World Liberty Financial completed a $590 million token sale (for accredited investors for now), with an assist from adviser\/investor and TRON founder Justin Sun. The Wall Street Journal reported that a Trump family representative also explored buying a stake in Binance.US, through World Liberty Financial.   From our Asia team, Sam Reynolds examined how the latest draft of the GENIUS act aims to split stablecoin regulation between state and federal authorities.  Parikshit Mishra reported on Coinbase returning to India after a two-year hiatus, setting off discussion about the future of crypto in India.  Shaurya Malwa continued his excellent reporting on XRP, pushing out multiple reports on Ripple. Malwa also reported on the implications of over-leveraging in the crypto market, as Hyperliquid lost $4 million due to a massive leveraged trade in ETH.  Market maven, Omkar Godbole, pushed out a timely piece on bitcoin's bullish signal ahead of the U.S. CPI report, and was also early to spot how Eric Trump's tweet on crypto were setting up short-term traders for disappointment.  Meanwhile, Tom Carreras had an excellent feature on how Bitdeer, a Singapore-based miner, hopes to shake up the mining machine market.  Hopefully next week brings better news in the markets.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"ByDanielle Chemtob  andForbes Daily  ByDanielle Chemtob , Forbes Staff  andForbes Daily , Forbes Staff.  Elon Musk has faced backlash over his government role and whether it would unfairly benefit his companies. Now, he\u2019s facing his first formal conflict of interest complaint. On Thursday, the nonprofit government watchdog Campaign Legal Center filed a complaint with an inspector general over Musk\u2019s involvement with a deal between the FAA and his company Starlink. The CLC argues the world\u2019s richest man appears to have \u201cpersonally and substantially participated\u201d in the dealings, though federal workers are banned from participating directly in government matters that affect them. Musk\u2019s business empire was built on public money, but he and President Donald Trump have previously downplayed concerns about his potential conflicts of interest. Kayla Bartkowski\/Getty Images The IRS shakeup continued Thursday as acting chief counsel William Paul was reportedly removed because he refused to cooperate with DOGE as its representatives allegedly sought to share taxpayer information with other federal agencies. The tax agency is also on its third commissioner in just over a month, and approximately 7,000 probationary employees have been fired. MORE: A federal judge dealt a blow to President Donald Trump\u2019s mass government layoff efforts, ordering multiple federal agencies to rehire tens of thousands of fired employees. Agencies that recently announced layoffs include the Department of Education, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the CIA. Alcohol has become the latest victim of the escalating trade war: On Thursday, President Donald Trump said he would impose a 200% tariff on alcohol products imported to the U.S. from European countries in response to the EU announcing new tariffs in retaliation for Trump\u2019s steel and aluminum levies. Trump said he would tax the products unless the EU removes the 50% tariff on imported American whiskey, among other goods targeted from Republican states. The S&P 500 officially closed in its first correction since 2023, continuing the market selloff that began last week in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs. The S&P\u2019s correction, which is a decline of more than 10% from peak levels, comes after the benchmark index reached an all-time high in February. Bolt's Ryan Breslow speaks during the 2022 Forbes 30 Under 30 Summit Three years after stepping down as the CEO of payments startup Bolt, Ryan Breslow has returned to lead the company following years of board room disputes, lawsuits, an SEC probe and a crumbling valuation. Breslow acknowledged he\u2019s \u201cmade a ton of mistakes,\u201d and the company settled a lawsuit from some of its largest investors over a controversial $450 million funding scheme. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) In asking the Department of Justice and FBI to investigate protests against Tesla, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) may have violated House ethics rules because she has a financial interest in the EV maker. Greene went on a buying spree of Tesla stock starting in September, and her stake is likely now valued between $7,400 and $116,000. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Thursday he\u2019ll vote to advance a Republican spending bill to avert a government shutdown, even though House Democrats almost unanimously opposed the measure. Schumer said allowing the government to shut down would be a \u201cdistraction\u201d for Democrats trying to combat President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda and would only serve to benefit Trump and his chief cost-cutter Elon Musk. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy told members of Congress on Thursday he signed a deal to allow Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE officials to start reviewing the U.S. Postal Service for potential cuts, as Trump has sought to overhaul the agency. DeJoy said he asked DOGE to review the \u201cunfunded mandates\u201d that Congress has forced USPS to follow, which include the agency\u2019s obligation to deliver mail six days a week, maintain post offices in rural areas, have uniform rates for first-class mail and provide free P.O. boxes to residents whose homes are not served by mail carriers. The White House withdrew President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for CDC director, David Weldon, just before he was set to appear before the Senate health committee Thursday. Weldon, a former Florida congressman who repeatedly expressed skepticism about the efficacy and safety of vaccines during his time in Congress, reportedly did not have enough support among senators to be confirmed. Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested Thursday he would need concessions before agreeing to a U.S. proposal for a 30-day ceasefire in its war with Ukraine. The U.S. resumed aid to Ukraine and agreed to lift its moratorium on intelligence sharing with the country this week after Kyiv said it would support the U.S. ceasefire proposal. The House voted to repeal a Biden-era rule focused on decentralized finance, or DeFi, which refers to peer-to-peer financial services on the blockchain. The rule would have subjected DeFi brokers to the same reporting rules as brokers for securities and operators of custodial digital asset trading platforms. The repeal bill is also expected to pass the Senate and be signed by President Donald Trump. Angel City FC, one of three NWSL teams Monarch Collective owns a stake in, changed hands last year at a $250 million valuation. TOPLINE Money is pouring in to fund the women\u2019s sports boom. Kara Nortman and Jasmine Robinson set out to raise $100 million when they started investment fund Monarch Collective two years ago, but their idea to exclusively target the burgeoning world of women\u2019s professional sports was so well received that they quickly blew past that figure. This week, the firm reached another milestone, expanding its war chest to $250 million. It\u2019s not as if Monarch was hurting for capital. Even with its three investments to date\u2014minority stakes in NWSL teams Angel City FC, San Diego Wave FC and BOS Nation FC\u2014the firm had \u201csignificant\u201d money left. But the cash infusion gives Monarch more optionality as it looks to make four or five additional investments across the life of its 10-year fund. The timing is opportune, coming off a record-setting year for women\u2019s sports. In 2024, the NWSL drew more than 2 million fans, the WNBA delivered its highest total attendance in 22 years, and the Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League had a promising debut season that included a capacity crowd of 21,105 at Montreal\u2019s Bell Centre in April, the largest audience ever for a women\u2019s hockey game. Meanwhile, broadcast viewership for women\u2019s sports rose 131% from 2023, according to TV data firm EDO. \u201cBrands and media companies are showing up to women\u2019s sports today not for DEI reasons but rather because it\u2019s a great investment,\u201d Robinson says. \u201cNo matter the political climate, making money is very bipartisan.\u201d WHY IT MATTERS \u201cWomen\u2019s sports leagues have achieved a series of financial breakthroughs recently, including landmark media rights deals for the WNBA and the NWSL, and team values have skyrocketed, with Angel City FC selling last year for $250 million,\u201d says Forbes staff writer Justin Birnbaum. \u201cMonarch\u2019s Robinson compares the opportunity of this moment to investing in the NFL during the 1970s or the NBA in the 1980s\u2014and she even suggests there could be a women\u2019s sports franchise worth $1 billion by the end of her fund\u2019s life cycle in 2033.\u201d MORE A Whole New Shoe Game For Women Consumers got a much-needed reprieve on prices as inflation came in below expectations in February after five consecutive monthly spikes. Still, the dizzying back-and-forth on tariffs adds uncertainty moving forward: $5.51: The price for a dozen eggs this week, down from $8 at the start of March, according to USDA data compiled by Trading Economics 4.2%: The increase in housing costs from a year ago on an unadjusted basis, the smallest annual monthly increase since December 2021 1.9%: The inflation rate for food at home, well under the overall CPI of 2.8% Giving feedback is part of the job as a manager, but it can be a tough conversation for both sides.

{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"The FBI says counterfeit versions of the drugs can cause health issues. The FBI is warning the public about counterfeit compounded weight loss drugs on the market that claim to contain semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, two prescription medications used for weight loss. A notice on the FBI's website warns that the fraudulent drugs purporting to contain semaglutide have been found instead to contain \"compounded mixtures of unknown drugs that do not contain semaglutide, drugs with high levels of impurities, and unsafe or unapproved drugs.\" The health risks of taking the \"misrepresented drugs\" include everything from cardiac and gastrointestinal disorders to nervous system disorders, psychiatric disorders and death, according to the FBI. The agency warns that the fraudulent drugs are being sold by \"noncompliant healthcare providers\" including weight loss clinics, pharmacies and medical spas. In one example, the FBI says a medical spa and weight loss clinic in the South sold its own compounded weight loss medication that was found to contain animal-grade semaglutide with vitamin B12, falling short of regulations set by the U.S Food and Drug Administration. The FBI says consumers should watch for and avoid \"suspiciously low prices\" of weight loss drugs sold by unlicensed healthcare providers and should purchase medications only from licensed pharmacies. The agency also says patients should consult with a medical provider before using any medications for weight loss. Legitimate versions of compound drugs are copies of FDA-approved medications made by licensed pharmacies and are not approved or inspected by the FDA. Drug compounding is allowed when drugs are on the FDA's shortage list, or in circumstances when a patient can't take a version of a drug made by a pharmaceutical company and need an alternative. Compounded versions of semaglutide require a prescription. A surge in popularity for medications used for weight loss over the past several years led to shortages of the drugs. The FDA recently declared the shortages \"resolved,\" removing drugs including Ozempic and Wegovy from its shortage list. The FDA subsequently announced a timeline for when most compounded versions may no longer be made. State-licensed pharmacies must stop making most compounded semaglutide (copies of Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Ozempic) by April 22, and larger outsourcing pharmacies by May 22, pending any court rulings. Ozempic is approved by the FDA to treat Type 2 diabetes, but some doctors prescribe the medication \"off-label\" for weight loss, as is permissible by the FDA. Wegovy contains the same main ingredient as Ozempic, semaglutide, and is FDA-approved for weight loss in people with obesity or who are overweight with at least one weight-related condition. It is also approved to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in adults with obesity or who are overweight with established cardiovascular disease. Semaglutide works by slowing down movement of food through the stomach and curbing appetite, thereby causing weight loss. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":0}

[Mar 14th]emphasis addedFrom Goldman: We lowered our Q1 GDP tracking estimate by 0.3pp to +1.3% last week. [Mar 10th estimate]Atlanta Fed Economist Patrick Higgins put out a special note For GDP Forecasters, Some Gold Doesn't Glitter We generally take a hands-off approach in updating and distributing our GDPNow model forecasts. With one exception, once a forecast quarter begins, the code of the model does not change. Any tweaks to the model are made at the beginning of the subsequent quarter.  The one exception was in spring 2020, when changes were made so that some monthly indicators showing steep declines early in the COVID-19 pandemic wouldn\u2019t be treated as outliers and ignored as they normally would.  While not on that level, the unusual widening of the January trade deficit that led to much of GDPNow\u2019s sharp decline on February 28, and the circumstances surrounding that decline, was also unprecedented in one respect. That is, as we now know from the March 6 full international trade report\u2014but could only strongly suspect based on anecdotal and non-US government data until then\u2014much of the widening of the trade deficit in January was due to an increase in nonmonetary gold imports from $13.2 billion in December to $32.6 billion in January. This accounted for nearly 60 percent of the widening of the goods trade deficit.  Although GDPNow does not distinguish gold from other imports, the Bureau of Economic Analysis does, in tallying up the total of the net exports, subaggregate within GDP. Removing gold from imports and exports leads to an increase in both GDPNow\u2019s topline growth forecast and the contribution of net exports to that forecast, of about 2 percentage points. The topline growth forecasts also increased today\u2014standard model -2.4 percent to -1.6 percent, \u201cgold adjusted\u201d model -0.4 percent to 0.4 percent\u2014as data from today\u2019s labor market report came in stronger than the model was expecting based on the limited February data the model received prior to that release.  The attached forecast tables include both the standard GDPNow forecast and the gold adjusted forecast. We will continue to update the standard GDPNow model through at least the end of the quarter but will add at least some occasional updates from the gold adjusted version as well. The next update for GDPNow will be on March 17th.  Currently the gold adjusted GDP tracking is 0.4% for Q1. ","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-14","content":"\ufeffIts AMD competitor seems great too, not that you can get that one either by  Maddy Myers It\u2019s a strange time to be reviewing an Nvidia graphics card. The company sent me a GeForce RTX 5080 a month and a half ago, and in that time, I\u2019ve played a lot of games and watched a lot of GPU benchmark comparison videos. But also in that time, Nvidia\u2019s longtime competitor AMD (which has historically been the underdog of the two) released its new line of cards, including the Radeon RX 9070 XT, which is shockingly comparable to the RTX 5080 while being significantly cheaper (the 9070 XT retails for $599, while the RTX 5080 costs $999). I figured, maybe by the time I post something, you\u2019d be able to buy either GPU. Here\u2019s the thing, though \u2014 you can\u2019t. Almost as soon as Nvidia\u2019s new cards hit the market in February, they sold out in less than an hour. The AMD cards are also in extraordinarily short supply. More troubling, both the Nvidia and AMD GPUs have ended up selling for significantly more than their retail price, either because of enterprising resellers, or because retailers can and do take advantage of the fact that people are always willing to pay quite a bit more for these cards than the list prices. But even if you were willing to pay several thousand dollars for one of these cards, you still might not be able to get one for months \u2014 or longer, it\u2019s hard to say right now. Not that many of these cards exist in the world at this time, seemingly. [Ed note: This is not a new problem.] I don\u2019t have a 9070 XT to which I can compare the RTX 5080, and if you\u2019re reading this and you care about that comparison, you\u2019ve probably already decided which one you prefer and what you hope to get. You might be the kind of person who has also been watching comparative benchmark videos and is willing to wait however long it takes to purchase the best-performing card on the market. Or you might be somebody more like me, who purchases what\u2019s available and affordable when I\u2019m in a position to upgrade. I actually bought an RTX 4070 Ti Super last fall with my own money. At that time, rumors suggested that Nvidia would release new cards in early 2025, but I was worried about President Trump\u2019s impending tariffs, and I guessed that the 50-series cards wouldn\u2019t actually be available to purchase for a long time after their debut anyway. It\u2019s why I actually bought all of the parts for a brand-new PC build alongside my new GPU. (Also, at that time I didn\u2019t know Nvidia was going to send me an RTX 5080 to review. One cannot and should not count on such things, even in our line of work.) This PC, for readers\u2019 reference, contains an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D 4.7 GHz 8-core processor, a Gigabyte X670 AORUS Elite AX motherboard, 64 GB of RAM, and a 1600 W power supply. I have two 1440p monitors and, unfortunately for testing purposes, no 4K displays. In addition to feeling desperate to upgrade my PC before Trump took office, lest I make an already expensive upgrade even pricier, I just wanted to play STALKER 2, which didn\u2019t run at all on my previous PC (the one that contained the RTX 3070 I reviewed in 2020, a card that\u2019s slightly below the recommended STALKER 2 system requirements). I\u2019m not saying that STALKER 2 ran poorly on my previous machine. It did not run at all. It wouldn\u2019t even load. Now, the PC version of STALKER 2 wasn\u2019t exactly optimized for success at launch, but I kept on trying after multiple updates, and it didn\u2019t go well. It seemed like an ill portent. Plus, the RTX 3070 was by far the newest component in my PC at that time. I was planning to circle back to the RTX 3070 as my comparison point for this RTX 5080 review because I figured the differences between it and my RTX 4070 Ti Super would be somewhat negligible, or at least, not very exciting to write about. Instead, I\u2019ve ended up realizing that my RTX 4070 Ti Super \u2014 by far the most expensive item in my new PC build \u2014 was not actually that great. I hate to even admit this because I\u2019m still kind of pissed off about it, but here we go. I had actually realized this problem long before the RTX 5080 arrived on my doorstep. Most games looked good on my new PC build, but Indiana Jones and the Great Circle \u2014 and let me use a technical term here \u2014 looked like dogshit. I could have, and would have, spent more time trying to figure out where the bottlenecking was happening, or why the frame rate in the game would plummet any time I tried to actually turn up the graphics settings at all to take some nice screenshots of what should have been a very pretty video game. Even on normal settings, it still tended to look shimmery and grainy and just plain wrong. I\u2019m now gratified to learn that I\u2019m not alone in this experience. Googling \u201cRTX 4070 Ti Super Indiana Jones and the Great Circle looks bad\u201d will yield tons of different forum threads on Steam, Reddit, and elsewhere from people having the same problems that I ran into. After a lot of tweaking with settings, I managed to find a sweet spot where the game looked pretty good and the frame rate wasn\u2019t suffering, but I felt confused and disappointed that it didn\u2019t look way better \u2014 and that this much effort was required to feel content with the results. After all, I had just upgraded my entire PC, and Great Circle was the first major AAA, graphically intensive game that was released after my big upgrade. It felt bad. I now feel extremely spoiled by how good my games have looked and performed in 1440p with the RTX 5080. As soon as I plugged it in and installed the new Nvidia drivers, Great Circle looked incredible, no tweaks required. With every setting maxed out, I was still able to average 120-125 frames per second in the game, even in wide-open areas with lots of moving assets on screen (with Nvidia\u2019s DLSS Frame Generation technology on the 4x setting). STALKER 2 fared even better, averaging 160 fps on all \u201cEpic\u201d settings and only dropping to 120 fps when I ran into those massive anomaly areas with tons of stuff floating around in the air. Perhaps the most satisfying point of comparison for me was Cyberpunk 2077. This is a game with a lot of shiny, reflective surfaces, and I had a blast taking pictures of them all. I compared them to some of my old screenshots when I first played the game, on my previous PC with the RTX 3070 (which was a brand-new card for me when that game was first released), and it\u2019s fun to see the improvements. Cyberpunk 2077 has gotten a big makeover (including DLSS 4 support and path tracing) since it was first released, and now, my PC has, too, and I get to reap the benefits. All of this said, would I have attempted to purchase an RTX 5080 on my own, had I not been sent one by Nvidia last month? I actually think I might have, but not for a long time \u2014 probably a year from now, or longer, once the card actually becomes widely available and affordable. By that point, my personal frustrations with the RTX 4070 Ti Super \u2014 itself not a particularly big jump in power compared to the RTX 4070 Ti and the RTX 4070 Super (yes, those are actually two other cards with extremely similar names) \u2014 might have motivated me to resell and trade up my GPU. Or perhaps in the intervening time, I would have troubleshooted whatever weird, unlikely bottleneck was happening with my GPU on Great Circle. I have the personal privilege, currently, of not having to figure that out anymore, because I have an RTX 5080 that makes everything look fantastic right out of the box with no work on my part at all. Even if I decide to upgrade to 4K monitors down the line, I\u2019m not too concerned about whether the RTX 5080 can keep up. For a regular person who\u2019s looking to purchase a GPU right this second, I don\u2019t know that I can recommend the RTX 5080 because you literally can\u2019t buy it right now. I mean, you can certainly try, and if you\u2019re as anxious about impending tariffs as I am, then maybe you should, despite the resale markup you\u2019ll probably face. Even Nvidia\u2019s 40-series cards are currently selling for hefty price tags, and it might be a while before even those cards get cheaper. They probably won\u2019t until the 50-series cards are more widely available, assuming that ever happens. This is part of why the entire competition between the Nvidia RTX 5080 and AMD RX 9070 XT is a theoretical one, at least for the moment. Unless you\u2019re willing to pay top dollar for a wallet-gouging resale on the exact new card you want, you\u2019re probably going to do what I did last fall, which was to purchase a decently new card that happened to be available at a bearable price during the time period that I was making said purchase. If that somehow ends up being an RTX 5080, I can promise you it\u2019ll make AAA games look fantastic for the next couple of years. Also, I hope you\u2019re surviving whatever is happening to you in the far future where that RTX 5080 was available to buy at a bearable price.
