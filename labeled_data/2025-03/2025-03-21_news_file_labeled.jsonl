The Tesla CEO pleads with employees (and, indirectly, to investors) to hang onto their stocks. by  Umar Shakir At a surprise all-hands-on meeting Thursday night in Texas, Tesla CEO Elon Musk rallied up his company\u2019s employees as the brand\u2019s public reputation continues to plummet, Business Insider reports. At the livestreamed meeting, Musk told employees to \u201chang on to your stock\u201d \u2013 which declined in value by 50 percent since December \u2013 and promised big things are coming for its Cybercab robotaxi and Optimus humanoid robot. Musk deflected on the stock drop at the meeting and reiterated promises that Tesla\u2019s autonomous software used for its vehicles\u2019 so-called Full Self-Driving feature, robotaxis, and Optimus bots would bring the company\u2019s value to new heights. \u201cIt\u2019s so profound and there\u2019s no comparison with anything in the past,\u201d Musk said. He says they can make about 5,000 Optimus robots this year. \u201cI think we will literally build a legion, at least one legion of robots this year and then probably 10 legions next year,\u201d Musk said. On the Cybercab, Musk said a \u201crevolutionary manufacturing process\u201d is in the works that can build a robotaxi in \u201cless than five seconds\u201d like \u201ca high-speed consumer electronics line.\u201d Musk said Tesla will need to make a very big casting machine, which sounds like the \u201cgigacasting\u201d process the company was working on but reportedly pulled back on last year. Tesla revealed the Cybercab at its \u201cWe, Robot\u201d event last year, and Musk said people could buy one for $30,000 by 2026. These all-hand-on meetings usually happen during the day, but Musk seems pressured by escalating protests and concerned analysts, like Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives, who expressed concerns about how much time Musk spends on politics. \u201cI have, like, 17 jobs,\u201d Musk told the employee audience. During the Q and A portion of the meeting, employees did not bring up Musk\u2019s role in Washington actively backing the Trump administration. Musk has been spending a good deal of time heading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) promising to cut wasteful government spending, but instead, recklessly gutting crucial institutions such as the FTC and USAID. In addition, he runs SpaceX, Neurallink, and The Boring Company.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Business Insider Edition  Since the beginning of the year, Tesla's stock has dropped almost 42%, shedding some $500 billion in market value. As Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox News viewers, it's the perfect time to buy.          \"If you want to learn something on this show tonight, buy Tesla,\" Lutnick said on Jesse Watters' show Wednesday. \"It's unbelievable that this guy's stock is this cheap,\" he added, referring to CEO Elon Musk. \"It'll never be this cheap again.\"               Lutnick's comments were the latest example of members of the Trump administration, including the president himself, using their political standing to promote a specific company \u2014 a concerning break with long-standing tradition, ethics experts say.               \"It's an ethics issue, and it's an optics issue,\" said Jordan Libowitz, head of communications for the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \"Whether or not there is some kind of quid quo pro here, people will question it. It will at least raise eyebrows when someone spends hundreds of millions of dollars to elect a president and then that president's administration takes action that appears to be an attempt to boost that person's net worth.\"               Richard Painter, the former chief ethics lawyer under President George Bush, said government officials have historically steered clear of picking favorites. \"The idea of promoting a company, the White House doesn't do that,\" he said. \"The Commerce Secretary is not Jim Cramer.\"               Spokespeople for the Department of Commerce, the White House, and Tesla didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.               Musk's firing of thousands of government employees in his role as de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency sparked a protest movement called #TeslaTakedown. Over the last two months, protesters have set fire to Tesla cars and charging stations. Sales have also dropped as buyers boycott the brand.               The administration has rushed to support Musk's company. Last week, President Trump held what was effectively a promotional event on the grounds of the White House, posing for photographs in front of Teslas lined up along the South Lawn. Trump agreed to buy a Model S, writing in a Truth Social post ahead of the event that his purchase was a \"show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.\" Trump said he would write a check for $80,000, though it's unclear if he ever did.               Ethics experts say it's virtually unprecedented for members of an administration to throw their weight behind a single company. While the government has supported specific industries or bailed out companies in the past, its actions have been couched in the context of protecting American jobs, Libowitz said.               Painter and Kathleen Clark, a professor of law at Washington University, said Lutnick's comments violate a section of the federal code that says government employees may not use their office for their own private gain; that of their friends, relatives, or other affiliates; or to endorse \"any product, service, or enterprise.\"               Lutnick said he would divest his financial holdings within 90 days of joining the government, as is standard practice. It's unclear whether he has done so. According to the most recent security filings, one of Lutnick's holdings, the brokerage firm Cantor Fitzgerald, owns Tesla stock. Also on Wednesday, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Andres Sheppard upgraded Tesla to the equivalent of a \"buy\" rating after visiting one of its factories.               \"When people understand the things he's building, the robots he's building, the technology he's building,\" Lutnick said on Fox, \"people are going to be dreaming of today.\"               This isn't the first time an administration has touted a specific business. Less than a month into the first Trump administration, the president's close advisor, Kellyanne Conway, told Fox viewers to support Ivanka Trump's fashion line. \"Go buy Ivanka's stuff, is what I would say,\" Conway said. At the time, Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said the comments were \"wrong, wrong, wrong, and there's no excuse for it,\" The New York Times reported. Chaffetz and the then-top Democratic lawmaker on the committee, Elijah Cummings, wrote a letter to the US Office of Government Ethics, and then-press secretary Sean Spicer said Conway had been \"counseled\" on the matter.               Others who wanted to curry favor with Trump during his first administration chose to stay at his hotel in Washington DC or play golf at Trump courses. When Joe Biden became president in 2021, he kept his name on the Penn Biden Center at the University of Pennsylvania, which Painter said the university used to raise funds \u2014 an arrangement that rankled the ethics lawyer. \"The use of the president's name to sell cars, to raise money for a private university, is unacceptable. It never happened before 2016,\" Painter said. \"This Tesla thing is not good.\"               Nor is it very helpful for the company, at least in the short run. Despite the administration's efforts, Tesla's downward momentum hasn't reversed. Its shares rose 1.3% on Thursday, closing at $236, down from a peak closing price of $479 in mid-December. Its stock price is on pace for its ninth straight weekly decline.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Business Insider Edition  Elon Musk has a message for his Tesla employees: Don't fear the stock's recent sell-off.          In a surprise all-hands meeting with Tesla staffers Thursday night, he said employees should \"hang on to your stock\" despite it losing roughly half its value since December.               Musk spent the first half of the hourlong meeting giving updates on Tesla's safety record, its delivery figures, and the company's work on autonomous driving and robotics. The rest of the session was open to employees to ask questions.               The meeting, which was held on short notice at Tesla's Texas Gigafactory, was livestreamed on X. It was scheduled to start at 9:30 p.m. ET, but the livestream cut out abruptly, sparking confusion among some employees. Tesla then started a new livestream, which displayed a loading screen until the meeting kicked off at 9:58 p.m. ET.                  Tesla all-hands live presentation https:\/\/t.co\/jQOt6WB2LN           \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 21, 2025           Tesla typically holds its all-hands meetings during regular work hours.               Here are the five biggest takeaways from Tesla's all-hands meeting.               Musk alluded to the turmoil surrounding Tesla's stock price while speaking about the company's autonomous driving ambitions.               \"It's very difficult for people in the stock market \u2014 especially those that look in the rear-view mirror, which is most people \u2014 to imagine a future where suddenly a 10 million vehicle fleet has five to 10 times the usefulness,\" Musk told employees.               Tesla's stock has declined in the past weeks\u00a0as the company grapples with\u00a0falling sales\u00a0and the controversy surrounding Musk's work with the White House DOGE office. Tesla showrooms have been hit with vandalism and protests nationwide.               \"If you read the news, it feels like armageddon. I can't walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire. What's going on?\" Musk said on Thursday night.               The company's stock price has dropped by more than 50% from its record highs in mid-December. Tesla shares closed at about $236 on Thursday, down from a peak closing price of $479 in December.               Musk says autonomous driving will unlock Tesla's true value.               \"It's so profound and there's no comparison with anything in the past. It just does not compute. But it will compute in the future. And some people, like Cathie Wood at ARK Invest, do see the future,\" Musk said on Thursday. ARK Invest set a $2,600 price target for Tesla's stock in June.               \"So what I am saying is, 'Hang on to your stock,'\" Musk added.               Tesla shares prices fell by half a percentage point after trading hours.               When an employee asked Musk what Tesla's operations team should focus on in the next couple of years, Musk said the robotaxi, also known as the Cybercab, would be a priority.               \"Well, we do want to scale up production to new heights, obviously, with the Cybercab. The Cybercab is not just a revolutionary car design, it's also a revolutionary manufacturing process,\" Musk said.               Musk said the production process for the Cybercab wasn't like a \"normal car manufacturing line\" but instead resembled a \"high-speed consumer electronics line.\"               \"In fact, the line will move so fast that actually, people can't even get close to it. I think it'll be able to produce a car, ultimately, in less than five seconds,\" Musk added.               Producing Cybercabs at such speeds would require Tesla to scale up its casting process, Musk said.               \"Let's see what is the limit of physics, of how big can a casting machine be. Let's find out. I'm game. I'm down,\" Musk continued.               Musk unveiled Tesla's Cybercab at the company's \"We, Robot\" event in Los Angeles in October. During that presentation, Musk said the Cybercab would be in production before 2027.               During a Tesla earnings call in October, Musk told investors the Cybercab will cost \"roughly $25,000.\" Musk said at the \"We, Robot\" event that he expects to sell the Cybercab for \"below $30,000.\"               \"We are aiming for at least 2 million units a year of Cybercab. That will be in more than one factory, but I think it's at least 2 million units a year, maybe 4 million ultimately,\" Musk said then, adding that the numbers were his \"best guesses.\"               Musk said he expects Tesla to ramp up its production of\u00a0Optimus robots\u00a0this year.               \"This year, we hopefully will be able to make about 5,000 Optimus robots,\" Musk said in response to an employee's question about when the robots would be available to the public.               Musk said Tesla aims to have enough parts to produce \"10,000, maybe 12,000\" robots.               \"But since it's a totally new product \u2014 everything is totally new \u2014 I will say we are succeeding if we get half of the 10,000. But even 5,000 robots, that's the size of a Roman legion,\" Musk said.               \"I think we will literally build a legion, at least one legion of robots this year and then probably 10 legions next year,\" he added.               In April, Musk said during an earnings call that the Optimus robots are Tesla's most valuable asset.               \"Because if you've got a sentient humanoid robot that is able to navigate reality and do tasks at request, there is no meaningful limit to the size of the economy,\" Musk told investors.               Employees did not ask Musk questions about politics during the question-and-answer session, which lasted around 30 minutes.               Some Tesla investors have criticized Musk's political involvement, saying it's weighing the company down.       Ross Gerber, a longtime Tesla investor, recently told BI that he doesn't expect Tesla's stock to rebound this year. He added that Musk had alienated Tesla's customers with his political activities and positions.       Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst who has consistently been bullish on Tesla, warned on Wednesday that Musk's work with the White House DOGE office is turning Tesla into a \"political symbol,\" and urged Musk to \"take a step back and balance his DOGE and Tesla CEO roles.\"               Despite the lack of questions on politics, Ives praised the all-hands in a note Friday, saying, \"Leaders lead in times of trouble and crisis....and last night Elon Musk took a major and much-needed step forward.\"               \"This was a key moment for Musk and Tesla to show leadership and he did. We applaud Musk for 'reading the room' and showing important hand holding at this key time for employees and investors,\" the note added.               Ives added that \"challenges clearly remain\" for the company. He urged Musk to take a \"small step back\" from DOGE and focus more on Tesla.               Musk told his workers on Thursday that he is \"stretched pretty thin,\" after one employee asked him if he is keen on making other products like airplanes or trains.               \"I have like 17 jobs, at this point. I just go to sleep, work, go to sleep, work, and then do that seven days a week pretty much,\" Musk said.               \"I guess I like being productive. I like getting things done,\" he added.               Musk runs half a dozen companies. Aside from Tesla, Musk splits his time between his rocket company, SpaceX, the social media platform X, the tunneling company The Boring Co., the neural-interface technology startup Neuralink, and the AI startup xAI.               That's in addition to his involvement with the White House DOGE office, where he's spearheading government spending cuts.               Musk said in an interview with Fox Business host Larry Kudlow on March 10 that he was balancing his political and business work \"with great difficulty.\"               Representatives for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment from BI.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"     New tariff policies have prompted a huge sell-off in the US stock markets and uncertainty for investors.    Plunging US stock prices have created much confusion for investors. The long-term impact of the new US tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump may be uncertain, but the short-term effects have been obvious -- stock prices in the leading US markets are crumbling.\u00a0 After the new tariffs were announced late Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 1,647 points on Thursday and has fallen another 2,000 points, or nearly 5%, on Friday. \"It is very difficult for businesses to plan in this chaotic tariff environment created by the Trump administration,\" said Robert Johnson, CEO of Economic Index Associates and professor of finance at Creighton University's Heider College of Business. Markets usually react negatively to tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods that usually drive up prices for consumers and stifle global trade. While escalating tariff threats are eroding both consumer and corporate confidence, cuts to the federal workforce are causing households to curb spending and sparking fears of a recession. \"This can result in an economic slowdown,\" Johnson said.\u00a0 A number of other factors are also contributing to stock market volatility, such as inflation, interest rate forecasts and fears of increased military conflict. Wall Street briefly rallied after the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate steady on March 19, but the forecast for higher inflation and lower economic growth in 2025 then sent stocks lower again.\u00a0 \"The stock market is affected both by reality and perception,\" said Rick Miller, a financial and investment adviser at Miller Investment Management. \"What people believe is happening is often as impactful as what the actual market conditions may be.\"\u00a0 Though a 10% dip in the stock market can be stressful, it's also pretty normal. The stock market has always recovered from steeper drops, including most recently the Great Recession and the COVID-19 meltdown. If you're nervous about your investments, like the state of your 401(k), financial experts say not to panic. While it can be painful to watch your investments shrink, it's not always a safer bet to change your strategy, especially if you're several years away from retirement. If you're in your 30s to early 50s, time is on your side to ride this out and play the long game.\u00a0 However, if you're on the cusp of retiring or you plan to retire early, Miller said you may want to cash in your qualified plans to preserve what you've built over the years.\u00a0 Despite the stock market's historical track record of bouncing back after downturns, retirees (or those approaching retirement) may be unable to afford the time it takes to recover. For example, after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, the market began to gain steam, but then the 2007-09 financial crisis hit. The stock market didn't fully recover until 2013. What's key is protecting your financial security. For example, as long as you don't withdraw money from your retirement accounts, selling assets within qualified workplace plans, like 401(k)s or IRAs, won't result in a tax bill no matter what your age.\u00a0 \"Cushion the effects a bit by making your qualified plan contributions aggressive until the markets stabilize,\" Miller said. It's a way to benefit from upward momentum in the market while keeping your nest egg safe from any further drops. Given the economy's broader problems, stocks are likely to bounce around a bit. Most financial advisers recommend against changing your strategy based on the latest stock market ups and downs. \"The best advice for long-term investors is to establish an investment plan and to stick to it,\" he said. It's generally wise to avoid selling in a panic. By doing so, you could be going against the general guidance for investing, which is to buy low and sell high.\u00a0 Financial planners often recommend using what's called a dollar-cost averaging strategy, where you invest a set amount each month regardless of market conditions. This approach takes some of the emotion out of investing and allows you to lock in low prices during stock market dips, even if you pay more when the market surges. Still, if you do choose to take advantage of lower prices, just keep in mind that the timing of a recovery is unpredictable. \"Even regular investors should consider 'buying low' when top quality companies experience price declines not seen for years,\" said Miller.\u00a0","label":1}
{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Business Insider Edition  A walkthrough at Printemps New York, a new retail venue in Manhattan's Financial District, is different every time you visit \u2014 and that's the point.          Ambient noise and mood lighting that changes throughout the day are designed to transport you to a playful Parisian apartment that will feel different at 10 a.m. than it does at 7 p.m. Though the space was originally designed to be part of a bank's headquarters, Printemps intends to make it a destination for foodies, fashion moguls, and local residents alike.       Printemps, a luxury French retailer, had the grand opening of its new location at One Wall Street in New York City on Friday. The Big Apple venture marks a diversion from the company's traditional brick-and-mortar concept to a more experience-focused retail model.               Jean-Marc Bellaiche, the CEO of Printemps, told Business Insider that the project started with the idea that \"New York doesn't need another department store.\" After the closing of Barneys and Jeffrey in 2020, Bellaiche said Printemps saw an opportunity to fill the luxury retail gap and increase its brand awareness among American consumers.               But, he added, the company knew it still needed to offer something different from fellow retailers to attract shoppers in such a competitive market.               The closures of some US retail giants in recent years could suggest that consumers are tightening their purse strings. But Neil Saunders, a retail analyst at GlobalData Retail, said Printemps' new store has the potential to \"shake things up\" in New York and be a \"launchpad\" for the brand. He said finding a niche in the city's crowded retail ecosystem and attracting loyal customers to the Financial District will be key.               After the pandemic, some department store companies worried that luxury shoppers wouldn't return to brick-and-mortar stores. But a 2024 report from EMARKETER found that 45% of US adult luxury shoppers reported buying luxury goods in person at a department store in the past 12 months, up from 32% in 2022.               Despite a post-pandemic recovery, luxury department stores in the US are still\u00a0struggling,\u00a0and consumers are spending less on luxury brands, eating into their profits.\u00a0\"It's going to be very, very hard work to make this succeed,\" Saunders said. \"That doesn't mean they can't, but I think that they're definitely running up a down escalator on this one.\"               Printemps, which already operates 20 stores across France and one in Doha, Qatar, sees this as an opportunity to do something different. The new venture is a return to the American market for the 160-year-old company; in 1987, Printemps opened its first US department store in Denver, filling a luxury retail niche in the city at the time. But business was slow, and the store closed two years later.               And in New York, Printemps faces more competition. While Bellaiche said there is an appetite for luxury retail in the US and New York, the crowded market is pushing the company to be more experimental.               \"I don't think any department store will close because of us, let's be humble,\" Bellaiche said. \"But, is there a way to bring something different, to make the noise, and little by little build a very strong business? We believe so.\"               Printemps New York is 55,000 square feet, spanning two floors at the base of a 50-story condominium, but it's a fraction of the size of its Paris flagship. Given its smaller size, the store had to be more specialized, leading the team to move away from shop-in-shops and opt for curated, multi-brand rooms instead, which include womenswear, menswear, beauty, and jewelry.               The French retail chain said it wanted to approach the venture as a \"hospitality project\" rather than a typical retail store; instead of focusing on making sales, it wants to win customers' time.               As it does in Paris, the space features multiple food and beverage concepts, including a caf, raw bar, cocktail bar, Champagne bar, and fine-dining restaurant led by Gregory Gourdet, a three-time James Beard award winner.               The store also features seven shopping areas, each with a unique design to complement the products on display, such as a haute couture Jean Paul Gautier dress, Nike sneakers, and La Rose cosmetics, a French pharmacy favorite.               One area is the historic red-and-gold mosaic lobby known as the Red Room. Previously the reception room of Irving Trust and Bank Company, it was designated as an interior landmark in 2024. After much conversation over how best to use the Art Deco space, Printemps turned the room into what it's calling a \"shoe forest,\" with tall footwear displays and gold lamps shaped like flowers.               While each room is distinct, Printemps channels maximalism throughout the space with bright colors, whimsical designs, and intricate art that hints at the company's French roots. Instead of having a designated walkway for customers to follow, Printemps encourages customers to wander through the space.               Printemps is also experimenting with programming and events with customers and brands, including talks, takeovers, and pop-ups, which the company hopes will help it engage with local clientele.               While the company told BI it has no plans to replicate the retail concept or strategy, it said it's already using its New York site as a \"proof of concept,\" or testing ground, for its Paris flagship location.               \"There's a little bit of that lab spirit for sure,\" Bellaiche said.               Because Printemps built its New York location from the ground up, it had the opportunity to try new technologies, such as a wayfinding system for customers to explore the store on their phones, and heat map technology to track busy areas and merchandising. Printemps decided to incorporate new brands in its catalog as well. The company said it's considering some of these changes for its flagship store in Paris.               As Printemps continues to look beyond Paris, Bellaiche told BI that the company plans to introduce an e-commerce site in the fall that sells its New York products and ships directly to the US.               \"This store will continue the storytelling every month. We need to come with new stories, new exclusive brands, new purpose,\" Bellaiche said. \"It's going to be a living entity.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

Now, she\u2019s fighting back.  Attorneys for Wynn-Williams this week filed an emergency motion seeking to dismiss the gag order that Meta won via an arbitrator. A copy of her motion, which I\u2019ve seen, argues that the nondisparagement agreement she signed when she left the company isn\u2019t enforceable, while Meta has used it as the legal basis for banning her from talking about the book.  Naturally, the Streisand effect is on full display. Careless People debuted at the top of The New York Times Best Seller list. It\u2019s now also of interest to multiple governments.  \u201cMembers of the United States Congress, the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and the Parliament of the European Union have requested to speak with Ms. Wynn-Williams on the issues of public concern raised in her memoir,\u201d her motion to lift the gag order reads. \u201cThese include Meta\u2019s coordination with the Chinese Communist Party, its exploitation of emotionally vulnerable teenage girls, and its conduct in this very arbitration.\u201d Facebook\u2019s decade-old effort to operate in China was heavily reported on at the time. Remember when Mark Zuckerberg was learning to speak Mandarin and jogging through Tiananmen Square? Whatever the reason for Wynn-Williams resurfacing the saga now, her timing is certainly apt. Zuckerberg is in the process of reorienting his company to be politically aligned with the Trump administration and making regular visits to the White House to discuss \u201cAmerican technology leadership.\u201d If I wanted to throw a wrench in those conversations, especially when DeepSeek has reframed the debate about how the US should approach the AI arms race with China, I\u2019d resurface that Zuckerberg was willing to censor on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. (In what I\u2019m sure is another coincidence of timing, Meta will be defending itself against the US government wanting to break it up next month.) If I had to guess, we\u2019ll be hearing more from Wynn-Williams now that lawmakers have taken an interest in her story. Even though she has been barred from promoting her book, members of Congress could subpoena her, which would give legal cover to let her speak freely again. Meta spokesman Andy Stone tells me that the company \u201chas no intention of interfering with anyone\u2019s rights under the law.\u201d There are parallels to Wynn-Williams and Frances Haugen, Meta\u2019s last well-known, ex-employee agitator. Both women filed SEC whistleblower complaints (which can result in monetary awards) before taking their stories to the media. And both positioned themselves as sober-minded, skeptical outsiders who unsuccessfully tried to make positive change from within.  Unlike Haugen, however, Wynn-Williams doesn\u2019t provide receipts. Most of the criticism of Careless People from Meta insiders focuses on details in the book they claim were distorted or completely fabricated.  \u201cWhile her book contains kernels of truth, it is riddled with factual inaccuracies, exaggerations, and omissions, including things she writes about myself and my team\u2019s work on elections (though we are never directly named.),\u201d writes Katie Harbath, an early Facebook policy leader who has her own book coming soon. \u201cAnd when the facts are wrong, the broader conversation about Facebook\u2019s role in the world gets lost.\u201d Others have chimed in to refute Wynn-Williams\u2019 retelling of events. Dex Hunter-Torricke, Facebook\u2019s former head of executive communications, contests how she describes a game of Settlers of Catan with Mark Zuckerberg during a work trip in Indonesia. And Facebook\u2019s former CMO, Gary Briggs, says that Wynn-Williams made up details about a karaoke session he was present for on Zuckerberg\u2019s private jet.  Most of the pushback from ex-colleagues focuses on the way Wynn-Williams writes about ex-COO Sheryl Sandberg and policy chief Joel Kaplan. She alleges that both made inappropriate comments to her and that Kaplan went so far as to grind on her while dancing. (Meta says Kaplan was cleared in an internal investigation before Wynn-Williams was fired.)  Careless People is at its best when it focuses on Wynn-Williams\u2019 inner monologue and experience of discovering the quirks of working in Silicon Valley. However, her repeated shock that the company makes decisions in the interest of its business over everything else starts to feel old after a while. We\u2019ve seen this story before, and we know how it ends. I was surprised to see that Facebook cofounder Dustin Moskovitz, who has historically shied away from openly criticizing the company that made him a billionaire, endorses the book. Brooke Oberwetter, a former Facebook policy manager whose time at the company overlapped with the period Wynn-Williams writes about, also recommends it.  \u201cI can\u2019t fact check the whole book (and neither can anyone else), but I can say that the meetings and events I was a part of that are recounted in the book (and things that were relayed to me by others contemporaneously) are accurately represented,\u201d she writes on LinkedIn. \u201cMaybe more importantly, the vibe she captured is spot on. It was just all so juvenile.\u201d Ultimately, Careless People is a test for how you feel about Meta. For many, it only reaffirms the belief that the company\u2019s leaders are ruthless, immoral capitalists. For others, it\u2019s a hit job that bends reality to enforce a familiar narrative.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"        Mandalit del Barco                        Carl Erik Rinsch at an event in Los Angeles in 2015.                                                           John Sciulli\/Getty Images                                       hide caption  Hollywood filmmaker Carl Erik Rinsch has been charged with defrauding Netflix to the tune of $11 million. He had been working on a TV series for the streamer that was never completed. Instead, according to prosecutors, the 47-year-old director spent the streamer's funds to speculate on cryptocurrency, stay in high-end hotels and rentals and buy luxury cars. Police in West Hollywood arrested him this week. The FBI's New York Field Office and the Acting U.S. Attorney of the Southern District of New York indicted Rinsch on charges of wire fraud, money laundering and unlawful monetary transactions. Those charges could land him in prison for decades. The saga began in 2018, when Netflix agreed to pay Rinsch to make White Horse \u2014 later named Conquest \u2014 a science fiction TV series about an artificial, humanlike species called the \"Organic Intelligent.\" The series was reportedly a passion project for Rinsch and his then-wife Gabriela Roses Bentancor, and was already underway. According to a 2023 New York Times investigation, the streamer gave Rinsch a coveted \"final cut\" deal to make decisions about the project. Before that, Rinsch had only made one big budget feature \u2014 47 Ronin, a samurai story starring Keanu Reeves that bombed at the box office.\u00a0 Between 2018 and 2019, Netflix paid $44 million for the series. Rinsch resumed shooting episodes in Brazil, Uruguay and Budapest. Then, according to prosecutors, he asked the streamer for another $11 million to complete the production. That never came to be. The New York Times reported that during production, Rinsch's behavior grew more and more \"erratic\"; crew members complained about his onset behavior, and privately, his wife filed for divorce in 2020. The FBI and the Acting U.S. Attorney of the Southern District of New York say that instead of completing the promised television series, Rinsch spent that extra $11 million on himself \u2014 speculating on securities and cryptocurrency and living the high life. FBI assistant director Leslie Backschies said in a statement that Rinsch used the money \"to finance lavish purchases and personal investments.\" According to the indictment, which identifies Netflix as \"Streaming Company-1,\" that included staying in luxury hotels, and buying millions of dollars worth of high-end furniture and antiques and hundreds of thousands in a watch and high-end clothing, along with five Rolls-Royces and a Ferrari. Even after losing money on the stock market, Rinsch told Netflix that his series was \"awesome and moving forward really well,\" according to the indictment. Though Rinsch claimed that the streamer owed him money after Netflix cancelled the show, an arbitrator ruled in Netflix's favor last year, requiring the director to pay the company $11.8 million. The streamer declined to comment to NPR about Rinsch. His attorney Anne Carney told NPR she can't discuss the case. According to the Associated Press, Rinsch appeared in federal court in Los Angeles with shackles on his arms and legs and agreed to post a $100,000 bond. The Associated Press reports that his attorney Carney said at that hearing that she had not yet seen the prosecution's evidence against Rinsch and \"the allegations in this case are purely financial.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Business Insider Edition  Tesla notified employees of an all-hands shortly before the event, according to a memo viewed by Business Insider.          The company sent employees a link to a Teams chat and an X livestream on Thursday night with the message \"Join the Company All Hands to hear about Tesla's recent achievements and how we're making the impossible possible.\"               The event was set to kick off at 9:30 p.m. ET.               Some workers expressed confusion about the event and the short notice for the company meeting, according to Teams messages viewed by BI. Typically, Tesla hosts all-hands during regular work hours, and it is the first all-hands the carmaker has streamed publicly.               \"It feels a bit hasty. No one was expecting this tonight and we're all just trying to catch up,\" a Tesla engineer told BI, adding that some employees heard about the event on social media first and were questioning whether it was real.               Another worker told BI the event felt like a \"publicity stunt.\"               \"This is for the investors, not the workers,\" the employee said.               Adding to the confusion, Tesla posted a livestream link before the event was set to kick off, only to end the livestream and delete it about 30 minutes later. During the livestream, a man's voice could be heard saying several seemingly random things, including \"Dylan on stage\" and \"Stock parts. Joe. That's the best I can do.\"Some workers said they tried to access the livestream but the link on X didn't work, as Tesla sent a link to a livestream that had been deleted.               Tesla restarted a new livestream shortly before 9:30 p.m. ET, but the livestream remained silent for nearly 30 minutes.       Elon Musk tweeted a link to the event at 9:45 p.m. ET.                  Tesla all-hands live presentation https:\/\/t.co\/jQOt6WB2LN           \u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 21, 2025           The event began streaming at 9:58 p.m. and ended at 11:00 p.m. ET. Musk's private jet arrived in Austin just two hours before he addressed workers in the Texas Gigafactory.               Musk spent the first half of the hour-long call providing updates on Tesla, touching on the company's safety record, delivery figures, and its progress in autonomous driving and robotics.               He then spent the rest of the session taking questions from his employees.               Tesla has been facing headwinds in recent months. The carmaker's stock is down more than 37% year-to-date and a series of protests have erupted across Tesla sales and service centers over the past few weeks.               \"If you read the news, it feels like armageddon. I can't walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire. What's going on?\" Musk said on Thursday night.               \"Listen, I understand if you don't want to buy our product, but you don't have to burn it down. That's a bit unreasonable,\" he continued.               Musk also talked about Tesla's autonomous driving ambitions during the meeting, saying that self-driving will unlock the company's true value.               \"It's very difficult for people in the stock market \u2014 especially those that look in the rear-view mirror, which is most people \u2014 to imagine a future where suddenly a 10 million vehicle fleet has five to 10 times the usefulness,\" Musk told his workers.               \"So what I am saying is, 'Hang on to your stock,'\" Musk added.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"It\u2019s clear that AMD hit the jackpot with its recent RX 9070 XT and non-XT GPUs. The pair quickly climbed up every list of the best graphics cards, and perhaps more importantly, received a warm welcome from the GPU market at large (and thus sold out immediately). A new leak tells us that AMD is shipping lots of GPUs to try to keep up with the demand \u2014 and yet they\u2019re still not in stock. The information comes from Moore\u2019s Law Is Dead on YouTube, who claims to have spoken to a major online retailer about RDNA 4 stock levels. Both Nvidia and AMD have been in a pretty dire place since the release of their latest graphics cards, with many people referring to the RTX 50-series as a \u201cpaper launch.\u201d The cards just sell out too quickly and too many people are left trying to find one. In the case of Nvidia, customer interest is just one part of it all \u2014 a lot of it comes down to low stock. Many retailers complained about receiving very few cards, and the wait for the next shipment is quite long. In the case of AMD, though, the problem is entirely different \u2014 the company seemingly didn\u2019t anticipate the kind of interest RDNA 4 would be faced with. To that end, the retailer Moore\u2019s Law Is Dead spoke to claims that AMD is doing what it can. The anonymous source said that Nvidia and its partners have finally started shipping more Blackwell cards, with the RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070 being restocked. (The RTX 5090 is missing in action, to the surprise of no one.) But those shipments barely make a dent in what AMD and its partners are said to be delivering. According to the retailer, AMD is delivering 2x to 4x as many RDNA 4 GPUs as all weekly Blackwell shipments combined. This is great news, but I just checked, and the GPUs are still nowhere to be found at many major retailers, including Amazon and Newegg. While waiting for new GPUs is frustrating, it seems that both AMD and Nvidia are trying to rectify the problem. I\u2019m hopeful that the situation will improve soon, but it\u2019s impossible to say how long we\u2019ll have to wait. While both AMD and Nvidia make some of the best graphics cards, pitting the two against each other usually reveals that Nvidia dominates the GPU market with an over 80% share. However, a new survey revealed that, at least in the recent weeks, many gamers preferred to go with AMD when buying a GPU. But how long will this surprising lead even last? https:\/\/x.com\/3DCenter_org\/status\/1899732939686256846 AMD's RX 9070 XT hit the shelves last week, and the response has been largely positive. The GPU was expected to perform on around the same level as Nvidia's RTX 5070 Ti, making it capable of beating some of the best graphics cards. However, a known overclocker just managed to push the GPU to new heights, helping it beat Nvidia's $1,000+ RTX 5080. Der8auer took the RX 9070 XT out for an extensive spin and achieved interesting results. Prior to launch, many thought the RX 9070 XT would rival the RTX 5070 at best, but now, we've seen it beating not just the RTX 5070 Ti but also the RTX 5080 in today's test. The catch? Not only did Der8auer use a premium card, but the GPU was also overclocked and undervolted. Well, look at that. AMD actually released a graphics cards that was competitive on price, performance, and features with Nvidia. And it managed to keep enough cards in stock for the launch that it wasn't immediately ruined by scalpers. Although that might seem like a low bar to reach, it's what passes for a success story for GPU launches in 2025, because Nvidia's has been one of the worst we've ever seen. As exciting as it is that there's a new graphics card that's actually kind of good and worth paying money for, though, it's not time for AMD (or fans) to rest on their laurels. There's more to push for: most notably that prices should come down further. The RX 9070 is still too expensive \r Please enable Javascript to view this content  Upgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Business Insider Edition  Elon Musk's surprise late-night all-hands has already won over one Wall Street analyst.          Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, traditionally one of Tesla's most bullish followers, said the all-hands was a \"much-needed step forward\" for Musk.               Ives had previously warned Tesla was spiraling into a \"brand crisis tornado\" amid widespread protests and a plunging stock price.               \"This was a key moment for Musk and Tesla to show leadership and he did,\" he wrote in a note on Friday.               \"We applaud Musk for 'reading the room' and showing important hand-holding at this key time for employees and investors.\"               Ives has been one of Tesla and Musk's loudest advocates on Wall Street, consistently stressing optimism about the EV maker's long-term outlook.               However, in a change of tone on Thursday, the analyst warned that Tesla had descended into a \"crisis.\" He called on Musk to balance his time working on DOGE with his role as Tesla CEO, warning that the billionaire's work at the White House had turned the company into a \"political symbol.\"               Tesla's share price has almost halved since mid-December, with investors expressing concern over Musk's spending time in Washington, D.C.               Sales have plunged in multiple markets this year, while Tesla showrooms and vehicles have become a target for protests against widespread federal job cuts pushed through by DOGE.               The Tesla all-hands, which kicked off just before 10 p.m. ET and was livestreamed on X, sparked confusion among some employees who were notified only shortly before.               The event saw Musk address the turmoil around Tesla and the stock price.               The Tesla boss compared the public backlash and acts of vandalism against company property to \"armageddon,\" telling employees he couldn't \"walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire.\"               Musk also told investors to \"hang on to your stock,\" pointing to Tesla's upcoming \"Cybercab\" robotaxi and plans to build a \"legion\" of Optimus robots this year. Tesla shares prices fell by half a percentage point after trading hours.               In the Friday note, Ives said he believed Tesla's future remained bright thanks to its investments in autonomous vehicles, AI and robotics \u2014 but warned that challenges remain.               \"Musk needs to lead Tesla through this very turbulent period and show employees and investors the other side of this dark brand crisis tornado,\" wrote Ives.               \"We are not asking Musk to give up his DOGE initiative ... instead we and many top investors are asking for balance as Tesla CEO and DOGE in this key period for Tesla.\"               Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

When was it actually possible to buy a new computer that came with the newest version of Windows? Anyone who bought their current computer a day before that date (and quite possibly some months after) are being told to trash machines that are only about three and a half years old. The amount of electronic waste being generated by this is obscene. I think it'd be more telling to look at the newest computer that can't run Windows 11. It's really the age of the oldest computer Windows 11 supports. That's apparently eighth generation Intel processors, which were released in 2017, and similar for Ryzen 2000. The unsupported seventh generation was discontinued in late 2020. So you could have a three to three and a half year old computer that's not supported. Maybe worse depending on how long it took those last seventh generation processors to wash through the pipeline. I bought my daughter an 11th gen Intel PC and it was not compatible with Windows 11 because the BIOS didn't support TPM out of the box.

Some people have high-spec quality PCs from 2018 which would give another 5 years or more of excellent service, but MS have arbitrarily decided to render them into e-waste by stopping them from upgrading to Windows 11.  You're lucky if you can get 10 years out of most major appliances these days  Devices much younger than that are affected. Powerful PCs in perfect working order.Would you be happy to replace your perfectly working dishwasher b Not exactly the same thing. This is more saying if you own a house in an area of California where you can't get fire insurance you should buy another house. You need to already have the thing to upgrade the thing. I had a friend who is a struggling single mother way below the poverty line look at buying a replacement PC the other day. The second hand market shows Windows 10 machines for within $50 of a new Windows 11 laptop. Bottom of the line, but able to run Windows 11 none the less. It's very \"let them eat cake\" The reason Landlords suck and renters suck is largely down to landlords wanting to do the least amount of work. Like if you rent a condo from a strata, or a home on a HOA. You, the renter have to deal with the HOA\/Strata council thru the absentee landlord who doesn't do jack. Likewise you might live on the west coast, but your true landlord is some dippity doo in Florida. I'm not 100% against the idea of renting, but it needs to be a two-way conversation, and many landlords just a  Whatever. Get them into treatment...throw them in the hole...I don't care. I just want to be able to take my kid or even just myself into the city without having to look behind me when I walk. If the price of not having violent vagrants prowling the streets is that you have to go through the paperwork of locking them up, I'm all for it.

Windows 11 LTSC exists and it needs neither EFI Secure Boot, nor TPM. Or, and it doesn't need a Microsoft account either. Just saying. And Windows 10 LTSC will be supported until 2029 at the very least. But they could change that tomorrow if that aligns with their pivot to... whatever comes after the collapse of the AI craze. Windows 11 LTSC is also meant for kiosks, payment terminals, etc., and businesses really love to save money, so no, those requirements are unlikely to return. It also doesn't make sense to enable it for Windows updates - Microsoft wouldn't want its customers' PCs to become unbootable. Don't you need an underlying pro license to add enterprise ltsc? And isn't LTSC volume license only, minimum 5 copies, and subscription. So if you've got a windows 10 home laptop... you'd need to upgrade to pro and get a 5 license volume license subscription...that'd be absurd. Even if you've got 5 laptops around the house, it'd still be absurd. And anyone not already dealing with microsofts volume licensing department would be advised to continue to avoid that hassle. Buying new computers would probably end up cheaper over the long run, and they'd run better because its 5 years newer hardware too. Or maybe there is a channel to get on to LTSC that I'm not aware of? I certainly don't pretend to know may way fully around the labyrinthine Deathtrap Dungeon that is Microsoft licensing. Let's be real here, chances are you know enough to have knowledge of LTSC and the wherewith all to wipe your machine and install it then that same person likely knows of where to obtain a copy of it and chances are they are not overly concerned with Microsoft's potential loss of a couple dozen bucks. I bet someone reading this thread is working on such a machine currently.  Yar But why bother? If you are a home user and don't want to pay... just keep using windows 10 after its out of support. That's free too, and far less hassle. Security vulnerability risks for home users are largely mitigated with a decent firewall\/antivirus and good backups, good 2FA and password hygiene, and keeping your browser up to date. \"Let's be real here\" - if you do that \"upgrading\" to Win11 LTSC isn't really buying you that much more real security anyway.

Forcing them to buy a new computer or run an out of date OS is really, uh, courageous. I'm not sure that's really true anymore. A friend's mother ended up with an Asus that wouldn't complete it's initial Windows setup. Amazon refunded it and said keep it, so she asked me to install Linux on it because she'd like to try it.

Some say that Windows 11 is faster than Windows 10 in some situations. Have you benchmarked the apps you use? Not to defend Win11, it's a steaming pile, and personally, I'm sticking with 10 for the foreseeable future. Why wait? Buy WinServer 2022, VERY similar codebase to Win10, and supported until ~2033Pay MS 30$ to get ESU, which tiddies your Win10 \"24H2\"* up to Oct 2026. We normal users can not go for year two or three of ESU, only enterprises can.If you already subscribe to Microsoft 365, you can move to Windows 365 (with a price hike). This includes a Win11 PC \"in the cloud\" with all the goodies, but crucially, it also has 3 years of ESU included for the (Win10 \"24H2\"*) machine you use to access your clouddy one, this gets you to Oct 2028. These options are legal, and do not bend the license terms into a pretzel. Important for people in certain trades were certification, compliance and insurance in case of malpractice are important. Or, if you have a strong moral compass. If you are one of those people, seek profesional and legal advice from your guild or trade association. Also, please notice that, while running Win11 on unssuported hardware is legal, and Microsoft will not directly block you from doing so (compatibility may suffer if MS decides to start using in earnest some of the features that Win11 require), is an unssuported configuration and not valid for people in certain trades were certification, compliance and insurance in case of malpractice are important. Then we get to the murky ones (either because you sail the high seas or because you bend the license terms into a pretzel). Ask a lawyer if you are thinking of using them, doubly so if you work in regulated fields, areas: Win10 LTSC Enterprise 2021 is supported until ~2027, but is out of phase with Win10 \"24H2\", so, in the future some of the software you actually want to run may balk (or not) at the discrepancies.Win10 LTSC IoT 2021 is supported until ~2032. but again, is out of phase with Win10 \"24H2\", so, in the future some of the software you actually want to run may balk (or not) at the discrepancies. Also, it lacks some components that are present in both Win10 \"24H2\", Server 2022 and LTSC Enterprise, so you will be responsible to re-introduce them (if needed) AND keep them updated and secure.Win10 LTSC Enterprise 2019 (if you can get it), is supported until ~2030, but is EVEN MORE out of phase with Win10 \"24H2\", so, again, future risk that the software you actually want to run may balk (or not) at the discrepancies. Some notes:Only Server 2022 will be able to run Microsoft 365 in a supported configuration until ~2029.Stand Alone Office seems to be supported until ~2029.MSHTML (trident) will be supported on Win10 until ~2029. You either need to find a new supported browser after that, or stay tunned for future MS guidance.Edgium and Chrome support on Win10 deppends only on Google, as of this writing they have said nothing.Steam and Epic Games, being Electron Apps, depend on Chromium, and therefore, Google.FireFox has not said anything about the support matrix for Win10 at the time of writing. * Please notice that while the 24H2 name DOES NOT EXIST, MS backported certain features from Win11 to Win 10 AFTER 22H2. Also, removed some too, therefore the state (feature wise) of Win10 22H2 in 2022 is very different to the state of Win10 22H2 in 2024 or 2025, that's why I use the name Win10 \"24H2\" in quotations. ^ Excellent, thoughtful post for those who have legit reasons not to pir8. Other options include making VM of your old W10 installs if the software needing it doesn't require bare metal. I make a VM of any old install I might want to pick through at leisure since that's such a convenient form of backup (and yes, I back up VMs that matter since one is none and two is some) PC sales leveled off post covid.  Superficially cutting support for Win10 is just another way to move hardware and OS licenses. MS has always needed people to buy new PCs.  It's part of the \"home\" OS license business model.  It's much easier for MS to sell OS licenses in bulk to OEMs than to sell upgrades to end users. Bill Gates and Paul Allen are buying, right? Paul Allen is pushing up daisies and Bill is too busy pushing in Daisies. So no help there. There are some people who benefit from a secure bootchain, but deciding for their sake that everyone must have it to run the OS is not an appropriate response. Most others would go out of business if they style themselves as complete assholes like that. Well, this may not be the hill Microsoft dies on, but every time they pull a crap move, that hill comes closer. Apple does pretty much the same thing, but their userbase seems to be so enamored with getting the latest shiny that they don't seem to mind it.  Microsoft's problem is that nobody really jumps for joy over the latest beige box (yea, I realize most PC cases are black nowadays, but I digress) from Dell. See, if the PC industry had people lining up to buy a new machine because \"OMG, it's 0.2mm thinner!\", we wouldn't be having this discussion. I use my computer for my business, and when it died I bought a used gaming machine that purports to have been built early 2024.  It was running Windows 10 but I didn't really care as all my stuff runs on Windows 10.  I find that it won't run Windows 11 -- I'd have to buy a new computer. Ain't gonna.  Performance and compatibility are fine.  I'll buy ESU if necessary. Linux will happily take your Windows 10 PCs off of Microsoft's hands. And then you don't need to bother with a new PC for Windows 11 either because your Windows 10 PC will now be more productive than it ever was under bloated unstable spyware Windows. Need to run Windows? Run under a Linux VM and it will most likely work better than it did native. Non-techies will just run their machine until it ceases doing what they bought it to do while techies won't be seriously affected.

BTW I run Arch. .. especially the ones I buy from ppl. having been told that their Mac is no longer supported by Apple. I think this is great because I get very reasonable priced hardware to run Linux on, great Displays and perfect AIO PCs with a very nice Design. Or just keep using it!  I have a MBP from 2007 and another from 2015.  Great little machines, although the older one is beginning to feel a little geriatric.  I've also played around with OpenCore Legacy Patcher\/ [github.io] to run a newer version of macOS on an external SSD on my 2015 MBP. Seriously, people are just going to ignore Microsoft on this.  My experience with Windows 7 is that they still provide updates to the security software, even if there aren't any security patches. Instead you'll have to worry about Apple shenanigans instead. I have a 2015 MacBook Pro - when it was my personal \"daily driver\" I used rEFInd to dual boot OS X and Linux Mint. It worked great.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Business Insider Edition  Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Elon Musk's pledge in October to cut $2 trillion from federal spending came from a flub of a scripted moment between the pair.          Speaking on an episode of the \"All-In Podcast,\" which aired Thursday, Lutnick said the two had planned to announce at a Trump rally in Madison Square Garden that they would collectively save and earn $2 trillion for the US.               \"When I say to him: 'How much are you going to cut?' The deal was he's going to cut $1 trillion. And then he's supposed to say: 'And how much are you going to earn?' And I'm supposed to say $1 trillion,\" Lutnick said on the podcast.               But Lutnick said Musk didn't execute their script as planned.               \"Because we're in front of 22,000 people, and the place is erupting,\" Lutnick said. \"He says: '$2 trillion!' And I'm like, I think I said: 'All righty then.' Or something like that. I mean, what was I supposed to say?\" Lutnick continued.               At the rally, Lutnick had asked Musk how much he thought he could \"rip out of this wasted $6.5 trillion Harris-Biden budget.\"               \"I think we can do at least do $2 trillion,\" Musk replied.               Their onstage moment became the basis for doubts among some federal budget experts that Musk could truly cut $2 trillion, or nearly a third of the $6.75 trillion spent by the US in the 2024 fiscal year.               In January, Musk told political strategist Mark Penn that saving $2 trillion would be the \"best-case outcome\" and that his team had a \"good shot\" at cutting $1 trillion instead.               \"If we can drop the budget deficit from $2 trillion to $1 trillion and free up the economy to have additional growth such that the output of goods and services keeps pace with the increase in the money supply, then there will be no inflation. So that, I think, would be an epic outcome,\" Musk said in January.               In November, Musk had backed Lutnick to be President Donald Trump's treasury secretary pick.               Musk wrote in an X post then that as treasury secretary, Lutnick \"will actually enact change\" as opposed to Trump's eventual choice, Scott Bessent.

This drove unprecedented excitement in the market, even for Apple These particular lawyers must not have been watching the tech world for long.  Lines of fanbois used to form for new Apple shiny days ahead of a launch.  We didn't see that for their AI. IANAL, but if I had a nickel for every pre-annoounced tech product line that never saw the light of day, I'd have a mountain of nickels. Pre-release noise is standard business procedure. Butt-hurt, however, is not an injury that can be supported in litigation. Was Apple stupid to screw up? Yes. Did people actually hold off, breathlessly waiting Apple AI? No. Were I a betting person, I'd lay high odds on this getting thrown out, with prejudice. That would be great, if this situation was even slightly related to a tech product that never saw the light of day.  This isn't a concept that didn't pan out only affecting the hopeful. This is a product sold in great numbers that advertised a key feature as the reason to upgrade, but that key feature did not and never has existed. This is no different than advertising a self-flipping spatula, taking the customers money and giving them a regular spatula. You did receive a spatula, your new spatula works exac  Bait and switch is a valid injury, especially if a definite delivery date was foisted, or whether a product depreciated, waiting for a feature. Maybe the bet isn't so big. When Apple realized their self-driving car wasn't going to work out, they quietly killed the project.  They didn't advertise it as \"Full Self Driving\" and sell it to thousands of people despite the fact that it couldn't actually do what the name said. I'd venture a big contributing factor to the cancellation of Apple's car was because it was going to be electric.  Lately, we've been seeing a lot of examples where if your company's name isn't Tesla, that's probably not going to work out.  Hell, even if your company's name is Tesla, things aren't looking so great.   This seems to be one of those things like \"cities have high crime\" - a certain type of person is going to believe it no matter what the reality is.   Here on this planet, EV marketshare over time [eia.gov] looks like about the curve you'd expect for expensive, long-lived devices requiring new fueling infrastructure in a massive market. Apple could totally get away with false advertising if they really were a religion.  Or a politician for that matter, too. Let's be honest though, did anyone really feel like they got ripped off because Apple didn't come through with a slightly less awful Siri?  This smells more like lawyers looking for a payday than customers genuinely going \"Welp, only bought this thing for the AI features, so I may as well throw it in the trash!\" With that UID you've probably seen enough fanboi action in these forums to wonder why Apple doesn't just declare itself a religion and be done with it..  The gods know I have. Always buy a computer that everyone hates. Tim Cook donated $1 million himself [macrumors.com] to Trump's inauguration. Maybe that was not paid by Apple, Inc., but in a world where so many CEOs are considered the company's face I see no big difference. Apple didn't saturate anything, it advertised a feature, and it didn't generate \"unprecedented\" anything.It was totally ordinarry.  Also, what damage was done and what competition suffered.  Bush league of you ask me. Since when is Apple lying about AI even comparable to OpenAI or Musk lying about AI?  It's not even in the same conversation. I have a 16 Pro Max. I bought it for the USB port. Don't give a flying fuck about inform of \"AI\". I am completely confident that the people filing this lawsuit don't give a fuck about AI either - they just see a payday. Yeah, just because the last company in the world that needed the money scammed people for a payday doesn't mean the people should be able to also collect on a payday from that company when they spot the scam. The blame shifting is insane. There was zero need to advertise features that did not, and still do not exist. They didn't do it out of necessity or to survive, they did it to squeeze a bit more completely unneeded profit despite having more money than nearly any other organization in history. I have zer  That's what I saw advertised by Apple...the new glowing outline around the face of the phone. That part at least seems to work! There may be more comments in this discussion.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"A few years ago, the American automaker General Motors (GM) announced that it would be phasing out support for CarPlay and Android Auto in its new electric vehicles, in favor of its own software platform. It was a controversial decision, as many drivers who are in the market for a new vehicle consider CarPlay to be a must-have feature. Looking to capitalize on the situation, one GM dealership near Detroit, Michigan last year partnered with a third party to offer an aftermarket CarPlay installation service in GM's newer EV models. But, according to a report this week from automotive blog The Drive (via The Verge), GM recently blocked the dealership from offering that service due to safety concerns. \"We have made the difficult decision to discontinue this product,\" said White Automotive & Media Services, on its website that previously offered the CarPlay installation service. \"This was not a decision we made lightly, but due to a variety of factors, continuing to offer this product is no longer viable in the long term,\" it said. A spokesperson for GM told The Drive that unapproved aftermarket services \"could affect critical safety features,\" and pose other issues. \"Aftermarket services that introduce features not originally designed, thoroughly tested, and approved by GM may cause unintended issues for customers,\" the GM spokesperson said, in response to this matter. \"These issues could affect critical safety features and may also void portions of the vehicle's warranty.\" It is unclear if the aftermarket CarPlay system actually poses any safety issues, or if GM is simply unhappy that one dealership decided to go against the company's decision to focus on its own software platform. It is also unclear if customers who already had the installation service completed will be affected in any way. Update: A source connected to GM told us that the aftermarket CarPlay installation impacted critical vehicle functions and vehicle performance, and they said that future software updates might break CarPlay functionality.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Anthropic has finally added web search capabilities to Claude 3.7 Sonnet, allowing the AI chatbot to access up-to-date information beyond its knowledge cutoff date of October 2024. Announced on Thursday, the new feature enables Claude to search the internet for current events and information, so its accuracy should be significantly better when answering questions about recent developments. When Claude uses web search to inform its responses, the interface provides clickable citations that allow you to verify sources and fact-check information, meaning you won't have to conduct separate searches. The feature is currently available only to paying subscribers in the United States. Anthropic says it plans to roll out web search to free users and additional countries \"soon,\" but the company gave no specific timeline. Web search functionality has become a standard feature among leading AI chatbots. OpenAI began introducing ChatGPT Search to paying subscribers last fall and eventually made the feature available to all users \u2013 including those without a ChatGPT account \u2013 early last month. Anthropic is pitching the web search function as particularly valuable for professionals across various fields. The company suggests sales teams can use it to analyze industry trends, financial analysts can assess current market data, and researchers can build stronger literature reviews by searching across primary sources. For everyday users, the feature also promises to simplify comparison shopping by evaluating product features, prices, and reviews from multiple sources simultaneously. Paying Claude users in the US can access web search by enabling the feature through their profile settings menu. The functionality is currently limited to Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which is Anthropic's first \"hybrid reasoning model\" capable of both quick responses and step-by-step problem solving.

Whether you\u2019re looking for something within your budget or you want to find something that matches your space\u2019s aesthetic or you want something that looks like just any other speaker, you won\u2019t run out of options. But of course product designers don\u2019t run out of ideas for coming up with new concepts and eventually even actual products. There are those who carefully think about both the design part or the technical specs or in the case of really good designers, both. Desktop speakers have fewer innovative designs compared to bluetooth speakers but there are still some concepts out there worth noting. Designer: Hao Kong        The Hoan desktop speaker concept brings about a minimalist aesthetic but with a functional elegance. The designer also adds an element of eco-friendliness as one of their goals is to minimize the carbon footprint of the product if it ever gets produced. The speaker\u2019s functionality is a key visual element as the structural integrity is highlighted in the design. It has a clean, uncluttered design that integrates it into most of the modern desktop setups now. The speaker\u2019s aesthetic is emphasized more on the side and rear views where the structural beauty is highlighted but you can also see it from various angles.         The main focal point of the speaker is the grill that has a detailed mesh design that both covers and highlights the functional structure. The main body rests on a circular stand with a metal curvature holding it in between. It\u2019s such a simple, minimalist design but it means it can blend well with your desktop setup and also is economical in terms of space and production. He didn\u2019t indicate what materials will be used but if lessening the product footprint is the goal, then we can expect something that is sustainable as well.    The HOAN desktop speaker concept represents a thoughtful approach to desktop audio, blending minimalist design with functional elegance. As the concept gains traction, it will be interesting to see if it evolves into a commercially available product. Ultimately, the HOAN concept serves as a reminder that even in a saturated market, fresh perspectives and innovative design can capture attention. It highlights the potential for desktop audio to transcend mere functionality, becoming a visually compelling element within our personal workspaces.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":" Specialty coffee is a very competitive market and standing out requires more than just exceptional beans. For BIGFACE coffee, founded by NBA star Jimmy Butler, the mission was to create an experience that transcended the ordinary, beginning with the packaging itself. This ambitious project, a collaboration between package design experts Zenpack and creative studio Brandmonger, aimed to redefine high-end coffee presentation, focusing on tactile luxury and innovative engineering.The core challenge was to create a package that felt \u201cimpossible,\u201d a tangible representation of BIGFACE\u2019s commitment to excellence. This entailed pushing the boundaries of traditional coffee packaging, demanding meticulous attention to detail and a willingness to explore unconventional solutions.  The team aimed to achieve a seamless blend of aesthetic appeal and functional integrity, ensuring the packaging not only looked luxurious but also preserved the coffee\u2019s freshness. Zenpack\u2019s expertise was crucial in overcoming the technical hurdles. They tackled the challenge of maintaining the raised profile of the embossed logos, a critical element in achieving the desired tactile experience. This involved refining embossing techniques and employing specialized materials that could withstand the process without collapsing.The selection of materials was equally crucial. DESIGNER: Zenpack and Brandmonger       A matte polypropylene (PP) film with an anti-scuff coating was chosen for its luxurious feel and durability, ensuring the boxes retained their pristine appearance even after handling. The double-folded corners, a testament to the team\u2019s meticulous craftsmanship, provided perfectly sharp edges, enhancing the overall sense of quality. The resealable bags, designed to fit precisely within the boxes, were a masterclass in precision engineering. Specific tolerances were established to ensure a snug fit, preventing any unwanted movement. A one-way degassing valve was integrated into each bag, allowing carbon dioxide to escape while preventing oxygen from entering, thus preserving the coffee\u2019s aroma and flavor.         The bags themselves were a departure from the norm, featuring unconventional proportions that contributed to the packaging\u2019s unique aesthetic. The team also experimented with different bag materials and colors for each coffee variety\u2014Silver, Black, and White\u2014providing a distinct visual and tactile experience for each product. The exterior labels served as both informative and engaging elements. They provided essential details about the coffee, including its origin, roast profile, and flavor notes. A strategically placed QR code directed consumers to a dedicated online platform, offering a deeper dive into the BIGFACE brand story and the specific coffee they had purchased. This digital integration enhanced the customer experience, fostering a sense of connection and exclusivity.   The BIGFACE coffee packaging has garnered significant acclaim, receiving prestigious awards such as Gold at the iF Design Awards and Platinum and Gold at the Pentawards. These accolades are a testament to the project\u2019s innovative design, meticulous craftsmanship, and successful execution. This coffee packaging is more than just a container; it\u2019s a statement of the brand\u2019s commitment to excellence and its dedication to providing a unique and memorable experience. By pushing the boundaries of traditional packaging design, BIGFACE has created a product that not only delights the senses but also elevates the entire coffee experience. This project demonstrates how thoughtful design can transform a simple product into a symbol of luxury and innovation.  I\u2019ve always been a fan of tech that blends seamlessly into everyday use.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  V Stock   Question: How would you feel if you owned Visa stock (NYSE: V) and its value dropped by 35% or more in the coming months? Although such a drastic move might appear extreme, it has happened before and could occur again. Visa stock has shown mixed performance recently. It has risen by roughly 8% since early January this year, even as the S&P 500 has fallen by 4% over the same period. Visa benefited from stronger-than-expected Q1 FY\u201925 results (Sept. year), driven by rising payment volume and increased cross-border activity. However, several near-term challenges remain. The overall market is experiencing a significant sell-off, spurred by growing worries about a U.S. recession after tariffs were imposed by President Donald Trump on major trading partners. This situation could notably affect Visa, as its business is closely linked to consumer spending and international travel volumes. Here\u2019s the point: The main takeaway is that in a downturn, Visa stock might suffer substantial losses. Data from 2020 shows that V stock lost about 35% of its value in only a few quarters, and it experienced a peak-to-trough decline of around 25% during the 2022 inflation shock\u2014performing slightly worse than the S&P 500. This raises the question: Could the stock drop further and hit as low as $220 if a similar scenario unfolds? Naturally, individual stocks tend to be more volatile than diversified portfolios. Therefore, if you are searching for growth with lower volatility, you might consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 by generating returns of over 91% since its inception. President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive tariff policies \u2013 including a 20% tariff on Chinese imports and 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with stricter immigration controls \u2013 have raised fears that inflation could return. All of these factors suggest that the U.S. economy might face serious challenges and even a recession \u2013 as discussed in our analysis here on the macro picture. In fact, during a recent interview, the President did not rule out that additional tariffs might spark a recession. When considering the increased uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration\u2019s policies, these risks become even more significant. Additionally, the ongoing Ukraine\u2013Russia conflict and global trade tensions further cloud the economic outlook. Tariffs lead to higher import costs, which in turn drive up prices, reduce disposable income, and weaken consumer spending. These factors could affect Visa in several ways. Higher prices might force consumers to cut back on non-essential purchases, potentially reducing transaction volumes on Visa\u2019s network. If a recession follows, job losses and lower incomes could further depress spending and payment volumes. Businesses, facing increased costs, may also reduce their budgets, leading to lower corporate spending and fewer business transactions. Furthermore, if economic uncertainty curbs travel, Visa\u2019s high-margin cross-border payments could suffer, adversely affecting its revenues and profit margins. Visa stock has been more resilient than the S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. Although investors are hoping for a soft landing for the U.S. economy, one wonders how severe the situation could become if another recession occurs. Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash shows how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes. \u2022 Visa stock fell 24.5% from a high of $235.42 on 2 February 2022 to $177.65 on 2 October 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 30 June 2023  \u2022 Since then, the stock has climbed to a high of $362.71 on 2 March 2025 and is currently trading at around $340 \u2022 Visa stock dropped 36.4% from a high of $213.31 on 19 February 2020 to $135.74 on 23 March 2020, versus a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 28 August 2020 \u2022 Visa stock declined 52.1% from a high of $22.12 on 7 May 2008 to $10.61 on 20 January 2009, in contrast to a peak-to-trough drop of 56.8% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 18 December 2009 At its current price of approximately $340 per share, V is trading at around 31x consensus 2025 earnings, which appears somewhat high. The company\u2019s revenue growth is also modest, with consensus estimates forecasting growth of about 10% per year over FY\u201925 and FY\u201926. Moreover, Visa has recently come under scrutiny from antitrust authorities. Last year, the U.S. Justice Department accused Visa of illegally operating a monopoly in the U.S. debit market by unfairly limiting competition. This issue also presents a risk for Visa stock. Given this potential slowdown in growth and broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself the question: Will you continue holding your Visa stock now, or will you panic and sell if it begins falling to $150, $125, or even lower?

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  FDX Stock   FedEx stock (NYSE: FDX) recently released its financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, ending in February. The company reported earnings per share of $4.51 on revenues of $22.2 billion. While this represented a year-over-year increase of 2.3% in sales and 16.8% in earnings, FedEx\u2019s performance fell short of Wall Street's projections, which anticipated $4.57 in earnings per share on $21.9 billion in revenue. Furthermore, FedEx lowered its full-year adjusted EPS forecast to a range of $18.00\u2013$18.60 from its prior estimate of $19.00\u2013$20.00. This didn't bode well for its stock post the earnings announcement. Looking beyond just earnings, the current period presents broader market anxieties that pose additional difficulties for FedEx. Prevailing economic uncertainties in the United States are creating a less favorable environment for markets overall. FedEx stock is particularly susceptible due to its close ties to industrial growth. In fact, we anticipate that FDX stock could potentially fall to $150 per share. Here\u2019s the thing, in a downturn, FDX can lose \u2013 no \u2013 there is evidence, from the recent economic downturns, that FDX stock lost as much as 45% of its value over a span of just a few quarters. Now, of course, individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio \u2013 and in this environment if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. While FedEx\u2019s recent performance did show some encouraging signs, with sales surpassing analysts' expectations due to increased volume, significant macroeconomic challenges remain a key concern. Though inflation concerns have diminished, they haven't disappeared. The current administration's aggressive tariff and immigration policies have rekindled inflation anxieties, potentially signaling economic turbulence ahead. The heightened geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the new administration\u2019s bold policy initiatives presents additional challenges. With ongoing conflicts in Ukraine-Russia, renewed tensions with Israel-Gaza, trade uncertainties, and strained negotiations with long-standing allies including Canada, Mexico, and Europe, the risk landscape has grown increasingly complex. Notably, FDX stock has seen an impact worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns \u2014a critical consideration for investors evaluating their risk tolerance in today\u2019s volatile environment. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. \u2022 FDX stock fell 46.1% from a high of $264.91 on 4 January 2022 to $142.90 on 26 September 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 26 July 2023   \u2022 Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $313.52 on 16 July 2024 and currently trades at around $245 \u2022 FDX stock fell 45.1% from a high of $164.91 on 20 February 2020 to $90.49 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 16 July 2020 \u2022 FDX stock fell 68.1% from a high of $107.51 on 14 October 2007 to $34.28 on 9 March 2009, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 5 March 2013  FedEx\u2019s stock has declined 12% year-to-date (as of March 20), reflecting investor concerns about the company\u2019s decreased e-commerce activity post-pandemic peak, ongoing inflationary pressures, and weakened international shipping demand. This downward trend could potentially continue with the macroeconomic uncertainty. FedEx\u2019s revenue growth has been notably weak, averaging just 1.7% annually over the last three years \u2013 significantly lagging behind the S&P 500's 6.3% growth during the same timeframe. Moreover, its adjusted earnings have actually decreased by 15% since 2022. Despite this underperformance in both revenue and earnings, the company's stock price maintains a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 14.0, slightly above its three-year average of 13.0. So ask yourself the question: if you want to hold on to your FDX stock, will you panic and sell if it starts dropping to $200, or $150, or even lower levels?

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Nvidia has had some less-than-stellar graphics card launches over the years. Its RTX 2000-series was poorly received, with little interest in the flagship features of the time, and the RTX 40-series hardly blew us away. But the RTX 50-series has been something else entirely. It\u2019s the worst GPU launch I can remember in a long time. If you\u2019ve been following along, the latest is that the RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti are delayed again. But that\u2019s just one more straw on the camel\u2019s funeral pyre for this catastrophic GPU generation. It all started off strong for the RTX 50 series. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang took to the stage at CES 2025 and made some truly grandiose claims which had everyone excited. The RTX 5090 was going to double performance of the RTX 4090. The RTX 5070 was going to offer 4090-level performance at $549. Multi frame generation was going to give Nvidia such a lead, that AMD\u2019s cards would look ridiculous in comparison. It even \u201clowered\u201d the launch price of the RTX 5080 from its last-generation predecessor: $1000 instead of $1200 for the 4080 at its debut. But these claims looked to be more and more hyperbolic as the charts were analyzed in greater detail. Nvidia was fudging the numbers at best, or being downright dishonest at worst. The only fair comparisons on its charts were limited to just a single set of bars, and those painted a picture of cards that were good, but not that much better than their counterparts. And that proved to be right once reviews landed. The RTX 5090 was at best 30% faster than the 4090, and multi frame generation was useful in niche settings, but only really when native frame rates are already high. The RTX 5080 is only 10% faster than its last-generation counterpart, and the 5070 Ti and 5070 are even less exciting. Nvidia overpromised and undelivered. And that was just the first of its problems. Every time Nvidia has launched an RTX 50-series graphics card, two things have happened: It\u2019s gone out of stock within minutes, and the prices have exploded. The RTX 5090 regularly goes for over $3,000 on auction sites, and the RTX 5080 isn\u2019t much better at over $2,000 at times. Retailers and third-party board manufacturers raised their prices, too, so even if you get lucky and grab one of these from a major store it\u2019s already hundreds of dollars more than the Nvidia suggested price. That hasn\u2019t changed in the weeks since. The various RTX 50-series cards are still nowhere to be found outside of extremely overpriced options, and with new AMD RX 9000 competition, gamers are starting to look elsewhere. One of the biggest scandals from the RTX 40 generation of graphics cards, was how the high-power RTX 4090s started melting their power cables. Sometimes that was because of poor third-party cables, or user error inserting the connectors wrongly, but ultimately Nvidia just redesigned the power connector. That redesign was used in refreshed 4090s, as well as all the new RTX 50 cards. But the problem still persists in the new-generation, too. Several RTX 5090s and 5080s have been involved in melting power cable and connector incidents. Sometimes it\u2019s down to poor third-party cables, but in every instance the power cables have been getting far, far too hot. Over 150 degrees in some cases. That shouldn\u2019t happen, and though it might not be Nvidia\u2019s fault if a third-party cable melts or breaks, it\u2019s fair to levy criticism at Nvidia\u2019s power delivery design, which continues to have issues. If you spent thousands of dollars on an RTX 50 card, would you be happy losing 5-10% performance because the card was faulty? That\u2019s the problem faced by hundreds of gamers affected by Nvidia GPUs with missing ROPs. It\u2019s down to a hardware defect so no way to fix it themselves. Nvidia claims it affects around 0.5% of RTX 50 cards, though that number may be higher (here\u2019s how to check if you\u2019re effected). It suggests affected gamers send their cards back to the board manufacturer for a replacement or refund. With supply issues ongoing, though, that\u2019s not always a great option when it could result in delays in receiving a replacement. If you\u2019ve been waiting on a more affordable RTX 50-series card, you aren\u2019t alone, but the promised future of cheaper cards, greater stock, and broad card variety just doesn\u2019t seem to come. Nvidia keeps pushing back the launch of its GPUs, with the RTX 5070 first being delayed, and now the 5060 Ti and 5060 might not launch until April or even May. Any stock of the new cards that does land is quickly gobbled up by gamers and scalpers, too, so there\u2019s no sign of prices coming down any time soon. If Nvidia can launch the 5060 cards with sufficient stock, that might help ease the problem, but at this rate there\u2019s little confidence that they won\u2019t be delayed again, or when they do launch, they just quickly sell out anyway. Often when a new generation of graphics cards launches the last-generation becomes cheaper and more readily available as people upgrade and retailers look to shift old stock. But Nvidia wound down production of the 40-series in the latter half of 2024, so by the time its 50 series launched there wasn\u2019t much else available. As prices of the new cards exploded, the last-gen got gobbled up too. So now there are no 40-series cards available that aren\u2019t also ridiculously priced. So there\u2019s been almost no relief from this problem for months. The one shining light in this whole debacle is that AMD didn\u2019t drop the ball. When Nvidia floundered, it launched the RX 9070 XT and 9070 to much acclaim. The cards were good, available in large quantities, and more fairly priced. They still sold out pretty quickly and prices have risen in turn, but they aren\u2019t quite as overblown as Nvidia\u2019s, giving gamers at least some next-generation options. They can\u2019t compete with the top cards, are still limited to 16GB of VRAM, and the ray tracing and upscaling support still trail Nvidia a little, but the gaps have been closed significantly this generation. The 9070 XT is AMD\u2019s best GPU in years. Whether you\u2019re interested in an Nvidia RTX 50 or AMD RX 9000 graphics cards, you\u2019re going to have to wait for it. Stock is trickling in all the time, and 5060s are on the horizon. AMD is also promising big stock drops in the coming weeks, so prices and stock issues may start to ease in the coming months, but most gamers are still going to need to wait to get a fair deal. Try not to buy older cards, too. They will bottom out in value once the new-gen cards really arrive in sufficient quantities. It's like it's 2021 all over again. The prices of the best graphics cards are through the roof, and frankly, even the worst GPUs we've seen in the last few years are expensive. Every single card from the current generation is selling well above the recommended list price (MSRP), and unfortunately, what little remains of the previous gens is pricey, too. If you're struggling to\u00a0buy a GPU right now, I can relate. I've been through this myself in the last cryptocurrency mining-fueled GPU shortage when my old GTX 1060 was on its last legs and I was desperate to snag a new card. Here's what's happening right now and what you can do to still buy a graphics card right now. New report says the MSRP is pretty much dead It seems that we're not destined to have some of the best graphics cards at reasonable prices -- at least not just yet. Now, even a manufacturer that was previously known as budget-friendly is racking up the prices in its own online store. The Nvidia partner in question is Zotac, and not only did the company raise the prices of the RTX 5090, but it also removed the card that was previously sold at MSRP. As spotted by a Reddit user in the r\/Nvidia community, the prices of Zotac's versions of the RTX 5090 went up by a whole lot. The flagship card, the Zotac RTX 5090 Amp Extreme Infinity, costs a whopping $3,000. (It should come as no surprise that it's currently sold out, though.) One leak could be a fluke, but two leaks? MSI might be cooking. As per (now) two leaked images, MSI might have an exciting new GPU in the works, and it'd be one that could rival some of the best graphics cards. The GPU in question is another version of the RTX 5080, but this time, it's said to come with 24GB memory -- a major upgrade over the base version. This could finally push it past the RTX 4090, but will it really happen? Both leaks were spotted by VideoCardz, but surprisingly, MSI itself is the original source for both stories. First, the company posted a promotional video showcasing the RTX 5080 Vanguard GPU, and on the box, it's advertised as \"24GB GDDR7.\" This is an extra 8GB VRAM over the RTX 5080 that's currently available. Coincidentally, it's also the exact same memory capacity as the RTX 4090.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Published onMarch 21, 2025 There\u2019s still an element of mystery surrounding the Google Pixel 9a release. Despite launching, the latest Android phone isn\u2019t even available for pre-order yet, giving buyers a bit more time to mull over their decision. One of the biggest selling points of the device is the sticker price, which is $499 plus tax in the US. Even if that puts it in mid-range territory, many people will be interested to know if they can get a better deal on it, and we can look abroad for clues. The phone retails for a different price in each country, which led us to wonder where\u2019s the cheapest place to buy the Pixel 9a. We did the research, and you can find the answer below. We\u2019re just looking at the base 128GB model for this comparison, mainly because Google has only announced the price of this configuration in most territories. That said, these price structures are always relative, so knowing that the base model is the cheapest or most expensive in any particular country will tell you if it\u2019s the same case for the higher-spec version. QUICK ANSWER Canada is the cheapest place in the world to buy the Pixel 9a at the equivalent of $474 USD. Taiwan and Australia are the next cheapest places to buy it. JUMP TO KEY SECTIONS  We visited the online Google store for every country that has one, noting the starting price of the Pixel 9a. We then converted those various currencies into equivalent amounts in US dollars, ordered them from cheapest to most expensive, and put them in the table below. There\u2019s one exception to that, which you may have spotted already. The US price in the table includes an approximate 10% sales tax to reflect what an American would pay for the handset. We\u2019re looking at this from the point of view of a US resident at home or abroad, and you can often avoid or claim back this sales tax when you buy something in a foreign nation. It isn\u2019t a perfect metric, which we\u2019ll get on to later, but this at least gives you an idea of where the phone might be cheaper or more expensive. In some cases, the listed price includes the local sales tax, saving you a little more if you\u2019re able to claim it back before leaving the country. The cheapest place in the world to buy the Pixel 9a is Canada \u2014 at least, in theory. The device will be available for the equivalent of just $474 for our neighbors to the north, which is $25 less than Taiwan in second place and around $75 less than what a US buyer is paying post-tax. The big caveat here is that it\u2019s actually very difficult to avoid paying sales tax in Canada, even if you\u2019re a tourist. Tax rules can get very complicated, especially as they\u2019re country-specific, and we\u2019re potentially talking about moving across borders. However, the bottom line here is that most taxpayers won\u2019t actually get the device for less than $500 by the time they reach the checkout. Even when sales tax has been levied on American buyers, Google\u2019s home country is still one of the cheapest places in the world. The US is fourth on the list and almost $100 cheaper than parts of Europe. At the wrong end of the scale for buyers is Sweden, where the Pixel 9a will cost the equivalent of $649. The UK is only a couple of bucks cheaper at $647. It might seem strange to some people that there could be such a big price disparity for the same piece of hardware, but we\u2019ll take a look at why that might be below. In addition to the 256GB price, there are other unknowns about international Pixel 9a pricing. For example, at the time of writing, neither Japan nor India has the price of the base model listed on their respective Google Store websites. Japan is often one of the cheapest nations to buy new Android phones when conducting these types of comparisons, so we\u2019ll be interested to see where it ranks once the phone becomes available. Since the phone isn\u2019t even on sale yet, you should be very wary if you see it advertised below the retail price in the next few weeks. This doesn\u2019t have to be something nefarious, but it could be that the deal refers to a carrier offer, a trade-in, or some other strings-attached offer. This might not always be obvious, especially if you\u2019re in an unfamiliar country. There are also vendors in some countries who completely misrepresent what they\u2019re selling, which is why you need to be alert to this possibility. Third-party outlets could be selling stolen goods or even just reconditioned devices that have been returned but labeled as brand new. There\u2019s also a market for fake flagship phones, which might look like the real thing but have vastly inferior software. It\u2019s not for us to tell you when or where to buy your tech, but there\u2019s little advantage to be gained for an American buying the Pixel 9a abroad. This has probably occurred to you already, but as one of the cheapest countries on the list, you can\u2019t do a whole lot better in terms of price than in the US. On top of that, as we\u2019ve already touched on, crossing the border to Canada isn\u2019t necessarily going to get you the savings that the table suggests due to sales tax. Even if you did decide to pick up the device on your travels, you might have a big problem trying to use the warranty back home if something is wrong with it. There are other hidden risks, too, such as whether you might be questioned at US customs about whether you need to pay any sort of import taxes when you return. Besides, you probably won\u2019t have to wait more than a few months to see the Pixel 9a on sale in the US \u2014 Prime Day in July immediately springs to mind. If you can\u2019t wait that long, you could consider carrier offers. Some of them will probably give you the phone for free with the right plan commitment. You could also consider one of the Pixel 9a alternatives. It might cost Google the same amount to produce each handset, but the costs of getting them onto the shelves in each country will be starkly different. There are import taxes, shipping costs, labor overheads, and many other nation-specific charges to take into account. All of these regional costs need to be absorbed into the final sticker price of the phone wherever it\u2019s sold. Google is also a money-making machine. In addition to the cost of getting the Pixel 9a to market, the best price to charge for it is whatever the locals will pay for it. This means factors such as disposable income and spending power come into play. We might suppose that this could be one reason why places like Sweden are high on the list. Last but not least, a comparison in US dollars is going to be susceptible to exchange rate fluctuations. The political landscape at the moment is certainly taking its toll on the foreign exchange rates, sending volatile movements through the FX market. The order of the table above probably changes on a weekly basis, which is one of the reasons that we\u2019ll revisit this analysis periodically.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Business Insider Edition  Good morning. Tesla sprang a last-minute all-hands on employees last night. Typically, Tesla hosts all-hands during regular work hours \u2014 this one didn't kick off until 9:58 p.m. ET.          Musk spoke about the vandalism and protests at Tesla showrooms, told investors to \"hang on\" to their stock, and shared his plan for a \"legion\" of Optimus robots. Read the five biggest takeaways here.               In today's big story, investors are already bracing for one of the worst-case scenarios for the US economy.       What's on deck   Markets: Trump and the Fed are pointing fingers.       Tech: \"Severance\" is a hit. Apple TV+? Not so much.       Business: Trump's turning the screws on big law firms over DEI \u2014 but he's skipping one GOP favorite.               But first, fears of stagflation are gaining traction.       If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.   Forget a recession. Wall Street is getting wary about something worse.           The specter of stagflation sends a chill running down any investor's spine. Stagflation involves a toxic mix of below-trend growth and persistently high inflation. It effectively ties the hands of the Federal Reserve, preventing policymakers from lowering borrowing costs to stimulate growth.               It may not be here yet, but investors are already bracing for it.               As US stocks slipped into a 10% correction last week, investors dumped shares at a record clip. Key among their worries were fears of stagflation, BI's Jennifer Sor writes.               These fears were brought into sharper focus after the Fed's latest policy meeting on Wednesday, when the central bank lifted its inflation forecast and lowered its growth forecast for 2025.       Even before the Fed meeting, stagflation chatter was growing on Wall Street.           A common cause of uncertainty among top economists has been US President Donald Trump's trade war. Since the election, analysts have argued that the cost of Trump's protectionist trade policy would ultimately be borne by the consumer.               For David Kelly, the global strategy chief at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Trump's retaliatory tariffs are a significant factor driving stagflation concerns.               \"They're actually sort of the magic stagflation elixir,\" Kelly said. \"There are very few things that will actually give you a stagflationary impulse, which both slows growth and increases inflation.\"       1. Nvidia shares hit a \"death cross.\" The dreaded technical signal occurred because Nvidia's 50-day moving average hit $127.39, dipping below its 200-day moving average of $127.73. But one analyst told BI it's not a foolproof signal for a future decline.       2. President Trump's beef with the Fed. Trump wasn't happy about the Fed's decision to hold interest rates this week, but the central bank is supposed to be politically independent and thinks the president's tariff plan is stoking inflation. Here are five things to know about their rocky relationship.       3. One group of buyers could lift Tesla out of the red. Tesla's stock sell-off has been partly blamed on CEO Elon Musk's divisive politics. One analyst at TD Cowen thinks it could help the company in the long run, though, if Tesla's blue-county losses are offset by red-county gains.       1. Freelancers are feeling the pain of Google's \"spam\" crackdown. Google's definition of spam included many product-review articles, some written by freelancers. Now, publishers like Dotdash Meredith and Forbes have cut them loose, and their articles are dropping off sites.       2. \"Severance\" is a hit, but Apple TV+ isn't. Apple has been working on Apple TV+ for six years, and with \"Severance,\" it's got a certified hit: Critics love it, and so do audiences. But the streamer itself is reportedly losing $1 billion a year, and it's unclear why Apple keeps funding it.       3. Do you want AI in your dating apps? Some apps already offer AI romantic partners, matchmakers, or dating coaches. The problem is that users aren't sold on it.       1. Trump targeted 20 big law firms over DEI, but spared a GOP favorite. Twenty prominent big law firms were questioned by the federal government over their diversity programs. Jones Day, which is cozy with Trumpworld, wasn't \u2014 even though it appears to have many of the same programs.       2. How DOGE's cost-cutting could impact your summer vacation.

I also have for you a new-old gadget I love, a new Assassin\u2019s Creed title, a new mid-range Android phone, a decidedly not mid-range camera you\u2019ll want anyway, a great journaling app, and much more.

It\u2019s somehow both incredibly simple and one of the most customizable browsers I\u2019ve ever tried, which is a really hard balance to pull off. I spent 10 minutes mucking around in the settings, moving all the buttons and icons into exactly the right spot for me, and now everything seems to be where my thumb expects. It\u2019s great. Quiche is made by Greg de Jonckheere, a solo developer living in Japan. I reached out to Greg to see if he\u2019d share his Quiche Browser setup with me, because I wondered if he had any cool tips I didn\u2019t know about. Then I figured he should share with all of us and asked him to share his homescreen, too. Here it is, plus some info on the apps he uses and why: The phone: Still an iPhone 15 Pro. That rumored iPhone 17 Air better be compelling and keep the USB-C port (a must for iOS app development), otherwise the old 15 Pro might have to go for another ride. The wallpaper: I\u2019m stuck with the iOS 18 default, not so much for its aesthetics, but because I love the idea of an animated wallpaper that transitions beautifully with the time of day. Now if only Apple could let developers create their own\u2026 The apps: Quiche Browser (more on that below), Things (still the GOAT), Reeder Classic (same), Fantastical, Endel (in love with the new 8D Odyssey soundscape), Cosmos (like Pinterest, but with taste), Poolsuite FM (my favorite indie brand and radio), too many messaging apps (the perks of living in Asia while keeping in touch with friends and family in Europe \u2014 each country has its own go-to apps, and I need to be on all of them), plenty of Apple stock apps, and a folder full of apps to track my apps\u2019 downloads, reviews, subscriber counts, and revenue, as well as one with development builds. I use Spotlight and Siri suggestions a lot, as they\u2019re surprisingly good at remembering the apps I use most depending on time and location. So, my home screen doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect my actual usage. I also asked Greg to share his Quiche Browser setup.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"March 21, 2025 5 min read The Science behind Tariffs and How They Work President Donald Trump is threatening steep tariffs on virtually all imports. Here\u2019s what that means and what economics research suggests would be the impact By Meghan Bartels edited by Jeanna Bryner Container port, Shenzhen, China. Yinwei Liu\/Getty Images Confusion over tariffs has largely shaped the first months of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term. He has repeatedly announced 25 percent tariffs on imports from U.S. neighbors and allies Canada and Mexico, then temporarily delayed and reduced them. Trump has also targeted China, and here he has been less lenient: in February he implemented a 10 percent tariff, and this month he doubled that. He also raised the possibility that steep tariffs on most imports globally will be implemented in April. The results have been uncertainty in the stock market and widespread confusion about which tariffs are actually in effect at any given time. But there is also a deeper confusion about the policy: What are tariffs, really, and what do experts know about their impacts? It turns out that the verdict on effects is relatively clear: \u201cEconomists know that they are very inefficient; we know that they are very bad for consumers,\u201d says Luisa Blanco, an economist at Pepperdine University. Many countries, including the U.S., have historically imposed tariffs as high as 20 percent on imports as a tactic to protect local producers, but this has generally fallen out of favor as free trade has become the global norm. The U.S., in line with peer nations such as Japan and European Union members, has maintained some small tariffs on specific goods, such as passenger cars, that nations under free-trade agreements are exempt from.

And during his first term in the White House from 2017 until 2021, Trump implemented tariffs on solar panels, which are primarily produced in China, and on select Chinese industries, including medical and aerospace production. His successor from 2021 until January 2025, then president Joe Biden, kept most of those policies in place and even added tariffs on other China-made products, including electric vehicles and medical equipment. But Trump\u2019s favored approach involves using far higher rates\u2014apparently less of an economic tactic than a foreign policy one. Scientific American spoke with Blanco about the science behind tariffs and the types of ripple effects these taxes can have on people\u2019s daily lives. Conceptually, here\u2019s how economists think about trade: In an economically ideal world, every nation produces only the goods it can make most efficiently. The nation consumes what it needs of these products, then sells any surplus to other nations that don\u2019t produce these items as efficiently. The proceeds from those sales then fund imports of goods that the nation can\u2019t produce as efficiently. It\u2019s a mutually beneficial scenario that plays to each nation\u2019s strengths. \u201cBoth countries actually benefit by having access to more products, more goods, than if they just tried to produce everything themselves,\u201d Blanco says. This is the kind of free-trade situation fostered by pacts such as the United States\u2013Mexico-Canada Agreement, which in July 2020 replaced the North America Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. A simple way to think about an economic market is that producers and importers are willing to sell varying amounts of a good for varying prices, and customers are willing to buy that good for a range of prices. In a free market, buyers and sellers continuously perform a sort of indirect \u201cnegotiation\u201d that determines the retail value of a good. Some imported goods can cost more than domestically produced goods, but only if customers value them enough to pay more for them. (Consider a product such as Italian olive oil.) Other imported goods, such as T-shirts imported to the U.S. from China, cost less than domestic goods because the exporting company can produce them for far less than the cost of transporting those goods. A tariff interferes with this free-market scenario. It\u2019s basically a tax, but rather than a tax on a particular type of product (such as alcohol or gasoline), it\u2019s a tax on imports\u2014either from one country or across the board. Tariffs provide income to the government that applies them, although even after existing tariffs levied by Trump and Biden, the federal government last year collected about 30 times more revenue via individual income taxes than through tariffs. Traditionally, tariffs are meant to keep production at home. They artificially raise the price of imported products, allowing domestic manufacturers to charge higher prices without losing as many customers as they would if they raised prices without tariffs in place. That makes it easier for local producers to compete on goods that the U.S. does have a competitive advantage in producing. Even sellers not subject to a tariff can raise prices. For instance, after then president Barack Obama implemented a three-year tariff on China-made tires in 2009, tires produced domestically and imported from countries other than China became significantly more expensive as well, according to research published in 2022 in Applied Economics. And it is customers who ultimately bear the biggest burden of tariffs because\u2014to simplify\u2014they can either pay the naturally higher price of the U.S.-made goods or the artificially higher price of the imported alternative; either way, the customer pays more. This result weighs on the economy, Blanco says. \u201cTariffs actually create a deadweight loss\u201d in which the consumer loses more than the producer gains, she explains. Of course, the real marketplace is much more complicated and interconnected than what these explanations can encompass. For example, many goods have components that cross multiple borders multiple times. A product may be manufactured in the U.S. but rely on components sourced in a second country and processed in a third\u2014and these international journeys become even pricier when tariffs are added to the mix. There are \u201cdefinitely going to be huge distortions in the supply chain,\u201d Blanco says. The consequences add up. One analysis suggests that a 10 percent tariff on all international products and a 60 percent tariff on Chinese products could cut nearly $600 billion over four years from the U.S. gross domestic product, a common measurement of economic output, falling hardest in the earliest days. In addition, targeted nations, driven to protectionism by a trade partner\u2019s initial move, often levy their own retaliatory tariffs. Sometimes tariffs escalate repeatedly into a trade war, like the one that has simmered between the U.S. and China since 2018. A retaliatory tariff against the U.S. can magnify the impacts of higher prices on U.S. consumers, but it can also hurt export opportunities for the nation despite being meant to protect its manufacturers. Effects can ripple through an entire economy. For example, one large-scale study that looked at tariffs implemented across 50 years in 151 countries from 1963 to 2014 found that the policies caused small increases in unemployment and inequality. Blanco particularly worries about people with lower incomes, who have the least padding in their household budgets when costs rise. \u201cThese tariffs are going to be regressive taxes,\u201d she says. \u201cAt the end of the day, we all have to buy groceries.\u201d Meghan Bartels is a science journalist based in New York City.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Business Insider Edition  Elon Musk jetted into Austin for a surprise all-hands at Tesla's Texas Gigafactory on Thursday night. His visit left some workers feeling everything from confusion to reassurance to cynicism.          One longtime Tesla engineer said they felt it was \"a positive sign\" that Musk appears to still value the electric car manufacturer and its mission.               \"He always comes back to Tesla,\" the engineer said. Musk, who is involved with six different companies, has split his time between the ventures for years, they added \u2014 and the CEO's recent work with the Department of Government Efficiency isn't any different.               Two other workers said the all-hands helped strike a hopeful tone for the company.               A worker based in California, meanwhile, said they felt \"cynical\" about the event, particularly Musk's remarks on \"sustainable energy for all.\" The worker pointed to Musk's ties to Trump, who has gone after electric vehicle incentives.               Thomas Temme, a senior software engineer, echoed the California worker. \"He restated his mission about sustainable energy and achieving 'sustainable abundance' and it sounded really good,\" Temme said. \"But it doesn't really fit together with all of his politics.\"               Temme added that he appreciated Musk's willingness to answer questions from employees, and saw the all-hands as a positive for the company.               The California worker compared the event, which kicked off around 10 p.m. ET, to a \"publicity stunt\" due to its timing and the short notice for employees. (Several workers said they were notified of the all-hands less than an hour before it was scheduled to start.)               Another worker, based in Nevada, said they felt the event was all about \"appeasing shareholders\" and tuned out less than halfway through.               Tesla and Musk did not immediately respond to requests for comment.               Two other workers told BI they heard about the event on Musk's social media site X before they learned about it via internal company channels, leading to some confusion about the meeting, especially after the apparent technical difficulties with the public livestream. One worker said they never received an email about the all-hands, and four more said they skipped it entirely.               During the event, Musk provided updates on Tesla's delivery numbers and its work on Robotaxi and Optimus. Musk also took half of the event to answer questions from the group of workers he was addressing at the Texas Gigafactory.               Notably, no Tesla employees asked about DOGE, but Musk told staff he was \"stretched pretty thin\" in response to a question about whether he would consider manufacturing additional products like airplanes or trains.               Musk's private jet returned to an airport near Washington, D.C. less than two hours after the event ended, according to data from jet-tracking company JetSpy.               At least one analyst took Musk's presence at the factory as a positive sign.               Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives wrote in a note on Friday morning that Musk had taken \"a big step forward\" in meeting with Tesla employees.               The carmaker's stock has climbed more than 4% from yesterday. It's down about 39% year-to-date.       Do you work for Tesla or have a tip?

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  ALNY Stock Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ALNY), a biotech company specializing in RNA interference therapeutics for genetically defined diseases, has experienced remarkable growth with its stock price surging from below $150 in March 2024 to over $280 currently, representing nearly a 100% increase.   This impressive performance was largely driven by promising clinical trial results for its cardiovascular drug Amvuttra released in mid-2024. Today marks another significant milestone as the FDA has expanded Amvuttra\u2019s approval to include a broader patient population with a genetic heart condition, building upon its existing approval for treating protein accumulation in nerves. [1]  The expanded approval carries substantial revenue implications, with Amvuttra now projected to reach approximately $8 billion in peak sales\u2014a dramatic increase considering Alnylam's total revenue was just $2 billion last year. In response to this development, the company's stock jumped more than 10% during trading on Friday, March 21. Now that the stock has seen a large move, it looks relatively expensive - making it a expensive pick to buy at its current price of around $280. We believe there are some minor concerns with ALNY stock, which makes it relatively expensive given that its current valuation looks extremely high.  We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of ALNY stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, ALNY stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. \u2022 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals has a price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 16 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals' Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. \u2022 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 40.7% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.3% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Its revenues have grown 23.0% from $1.8 Bil to $2.2 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Also, its quarterly revenues grew 34.9% to $593 Mil in the most recent quarter from $440 Mil a year ago (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500) Alnylam Pharmaceuticals' profit margins are considerably worse than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. \u2022 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals' Operating Income over the last four quarters was $-177 Mil, which represents a very poor Operating Margin of -7.9% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals' Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $-8.3 Mil, pointing to a very poor OCF-to-Sales Ratio of -0.4% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500) Alnylam Pharmaceuticals' balance sheet looks very strong. \u2022 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals\u2019 Debt figure was $1.3 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $37 Bil (as of 3\/21\/2025). This implies a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 4% (vs. 19% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable]  \u2022 Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $2.7 Bil of the $4.2 Bil in Total Assets for Alnylam Pharmaceuticals. This yields a very strong Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 63.5% (vs. 14.8% for S&P 500) ALNY stock has seen an impact that was slightly better than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on ALNY stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. \u2022 ALNY stock fell 30.8% from a high of $173.91 on 3 January 2022 to $120.42 on 11 May 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 3 August 2022  \u2022 Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $300.55 on 16 October 2024 and currently trades at around $280 \u2022 ALNY stock fell 30.0% from a high of $133.12 on 20 February 2020 to $93.12 on 12 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 17 April 2020 \u2022 ALNY stock fell 58.6% from a high of $36.55 on 9 October 2007 to $15.14 on 9 March 2009, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 3 July 2013 In summary, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals' performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: \u2022 Growth: Extremely Strong  \u2022 Profitability: Extremely Weak  \u2022 Financial Stability: Extremely Strong  \u2022 Downturn Resilience: Neutral  \u2022 Overall: Strong Despite Alnylam's current elevated valuation making the stock appear costly, which supports the assessment that ALNY represents an expensive investment opportunity, potential investors should consider the company's shifting trajectory. After years focused primarily on drug development, Alnylam is now entering a phase where it can capitalize on these efforts. While the current valuation might seem steep at first glance, projected sales growth averaging approximately 25% annually over the next three years, coupled with potentially much stronger earnings growth, suggests the premium may be justified by the company\u2019s improving financial outlook. Worried about the rich valuation of ALNY stock? As an alternative, consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid- and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

TTD Stock Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) \u2013 an ad technology player that helps companies buy digital ads across publishers \u2013 has seen its stock crash 52% this year. This can primarily be attributed to a downbeat quarterly performance as well as a bleak outlook. In contrast, its peer \u2013 AppLovin \u2013 posted a solid set of numbers, bolstering its stock price growth. Although APP stock has also taken a hit lately, but for different reasons. But, now that TTD stock has seen a meaningful decline, does it look like a good buy?   We think that TTD stock looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy at its current price of around $56. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with TTD stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is extremely high.  We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of TTD stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Trade Desk along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, TTD stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. \u2022 Trade Desk has a price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 14.2 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500  \u2022 Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P\/EBIT) ratio is 81.3 compared to 24.3 for S&P 500  \u2022 And, it has a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 47.0 vs. the benchmark's 24.3 Trade Desk's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. \u2022 Trade Desk has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 26.9% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.3% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Its revenues have grown 25.6% from $1.9 Bil to $2.4 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Also, its quarterly revenues grew 22.3% to $741 Mil in the most recent quarter from $606 Mil a year ago (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500)  Trade Desk's profit margins are higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. \u2022 Trade Desk's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $427 Mil, which represents a moderate Operating Margin of 17.5% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Trade Desk's Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $739 Mil, pointing to a high OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 30.2% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500) Trade Desk's balance sheet looks very strong. \u2022 Trade Desk's Debt figure was $312 Mil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $28 Bil (as of 3\/20\/2025). This implies a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 0.9% (vs. 19.0% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable]  \u2022 Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $1.9 Bil of the $6.1 Bil in Total Assets for Trade Desk. This yields a very strong Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 31.4% (vs. 14.8% for S&P 500) TTD stock has seen an impact that was slightly better than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. \u2022 TTD stock fell 55.7% from a high of $90.11 on 3 January 2022 to $39.89 on 9 November 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 17 July 2023  \u2022 Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $139.51 on 4 December 2024 and currently trades at around $56 \u2022 TTD stock fell 54.2% from a high of $31.54 on 19 February 2020 to $14.44 on 18 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 7 May 2020 In summary, Trade Desk's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: \u2022 Growth: Extremely Strong  \u2022 Profitability: Strong  \u2022 Financial Stability: Extremely Strong  \u2022 Downturn Resilience: Neutral  \u2022 Overall: Very Strong Hence, despite its high valuation vis-\u00e0-vis the S&P 500, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that TTD is a tricky stock to buy. Not too happy about the volatile nature of TTD stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

President Trump fired both on March 18.                                                           Shuran Huang\/The Washington Post via Getty Images                                       hide caption  President Trump's firings this week of the two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission drew fresh outrage from people who view the terminations as blatant abuses of power, and renewed assertions from the White House that the president has the authority to fire such officers at will. Already, Trump's removals of Democrats at the Merit Systems Protection Board, the National Labor Relations Board, the Federal Labor Relations Authority and other independent agencies have been challenged in federal court. Now, it appears likely one of those cases will reach the Supreme Court. With several cases in the running, the question is which might get there first. The fired FTC commissioners have vowed to sue as well. Jan. 27 Equal Employment Opportunity CommissionFired Democratic Commissioners Charlotte Burrows and Jocelyn Samuels have not yet challenged their firings. National Labor Relations BoardDemocratic board member Gwynne Wilcox has since been reinstated by U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell. The D.C. Circuit is weighing the Trump administration's appeal. Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight BoardDemocratic members Travis LeBlanc and Edward Felten have challenged their firings. U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton has scheduled a hearing for April 30. Trump also fired Democratic Chair Sharon Bradford Franklin, but she did not challenge her firing. Jan. 31 Federal Election CommissionDemocratic Chair Ellen Weintraub has not yet challenged her firing. Feb. 7 Office of Special CounselSpecial Counsel Hampton Dellinger was reinstated by U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson and then removed again by the D.C. Circuit. On March 6, Dellinger ended his legal fight. Feb. 10 Merit Systems Protection BoardDemocratic member Cathy Harris has since been reinstated by U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras. The D.C. Circuit is weighing the Trump administration's appeal. Federal Labor Relations AuthorityDemocratic Chair Susan Tsui Grundmann has since been reinstated by U.S. District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan. March 18 Federal Trade CommissionDemocratic Commissioners Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya say they will challenge their firings. Asked about the firings of FTC Commissioners Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday that \"the time was right to let these people go,\" adding that the White House was prepared \"to fight it all the way to the Supreme Court.\" On Thursday, a group of lawmakers including Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Dick Durbin called on Trump to rescind the FTC terminations. \"This action contradicts long standing Supreme Court precedent, undermines Congress's constitutional authority to create bipartisan, independent commissions, and upends more than 110 years of work at the FTC to protect consumers from deceptive practices and monopoly power,\" stated their letter signed by 28 senators. The executive branch includes more than 50 independent agencies and government corporations. Many have historically operated with a degree of autonomy granted by Congress. The structure of some of these agencies, with members of both major parties serving staggered terms, has helped ensure some distance and independence from the White House. The officers Trump has tried to fire since January mostly had months and years left in their terms. In some cases, the terminations have left boards with only Republican members. The question that these firings raise is whether a Supreme Court decision known as Humphrey's Executor v. United States should stand. In 1935, the court unanimously upheld Congress' requirement that presidents can fire members of independent boards or commissions only for cause, such as inefficiency, malfeasance or neglect of duty. The case involved a conservative member of the FTC, whom President Franklin D. Roosevelt saw as standing in the way of his New Deal policies. William Humphrey died shortly after Roosevelt fired him, so it was his executor who sued the government and won.                  The Federal Trade Commission building in Washington, D.C.                                                           Paul J. Richards\/AFP via Getty Images                                       hide caption  But the court's current conservative supermajority has been chipping away at that precedent, so the Trump administration could prevail if this gets to the Supreme Court. The Justice Department maintains that the restrictions established by Humphrey's Executor don't apply to today's FTC or other multimember regulatory bodies, given the power those agencies now wield. In February, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in a letter to Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, that those commissions, in their present form, exercise substantial executive power, including through rulemaking and issuing unilateral decisions. \"An independent agency of that kind has 'no basis in history and no place in our constitutional structure,'\" Harris wrote, quoting a more recent Supreme Court decision that established that the president could remove the single director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for reasons other than cause. \"To the extent that Humphrey's Executor requires otherwise, the Department intends to urge the Supreme Court to overrule that decision, which prevents the President from adequately supervising principal officers in the Executive Branch who execute the laws on the President's behalf.\" In the CFPB case, the court limited its decision to agencies with a single director. But Harris' letter said the Justice Department believes removal restrictions at agencies with multimember commissions are also unconstitutional. Though the independent agencies are not all household names, their work touches the lives of everyday Americans in numerous ways. The FTC, for example, investigates unfair or deceptive business practices such as price-fixing and the use of noncompete agreements by employers. It reviews mergers to make sure they don't limit consumer choice. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reviews complaints from workers about discrimination on the job. The National Labor Relations Board is involved with settling labor disputes in the private sector. The Merit Systems Protection Board hears cases involving federal employees who believe they were wronged by the government. \"These agencies need to be able to operate with a level of independence so that they can do the work for the American people and not be puppet masters\" serving the president's allies, says Jared Davidson, counsel for the nonpartisan, nonprofit legal advocacy group Protect Democracy, which works to counter authoritarianism. Bedoya, one of the two FTC commissioners removed on Tuesday, warned that billionaires such as Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos, all of whom attended Trump's inauguration, will benefit from his firing and that of his co-commissioner, Slaughter. \"I am currently suing or enforcing court orders against each of their companies,\" Bedoya said in an interview on NPR's Morning Edition, adding that any of those actions could be withdrawn by the Republican commissioners still at the FTC.                  Guests including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk attend President Trump's inauguration in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 20.                                                           Julia Demaree Nikhinson\/AFP via Getty Images                                       hide caption  With legal challenges making their way to the Supreme Court, some lawyers and scholars are issuing dire warnings about the consequences of overturning Humphrey's Executor. \"It would be absolutely disastrous for the American people if the court decides to give the president carte blanche to ignore the clear mandate of Congress and turn these independent agencies into essentially groups of political cronies,\" says Davidson. If the Supreme Court overturns Humphrey's Executor, he warns, there would be little standing in the way of Trump firing members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors if he disagreed with their policies or wanted the Fed to take some specific action, which could destabilize the economy. It's a warning echoed by a group of law professors in an amicus brief filed with the Supreme Court.  Quoting from a law review article by Harvard Law professor and former Fed governor Daniel Tarullo, they note that the Fed \"would obviously be among the many agencies whose constitutionality would be under a cloud.\" \"The functioning of the Federal Reserve is essential to the stability of the American economy,\" the law professors wrote. \"Concerns (warranted or unwarranted) that its operations could be disrupted could foster financial and political instability and cause lasting harm.\" In another amicus brief filed in a separate case, the law professors give a chilling example of how the Fed's operations might be disrupted. \"There are times when a political leader seeking re-election will prioritize short-term economic activity over long-term price stability. A president may, for example, want unemployment to go down and economic activity to increase in the run-up to voting,\" they wrote. \"More accommodative monetary policy can achieve those effects but also will increase the risk of higher levels of inflation in the future.\" On Wednesday night, after the Fed kept interest rates unchanged, Trump posted a message on social media second-guessing that decision. \"The Fed would be MUCH better off CUTTING RATES as U.S. Tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy. Do the right thing,\" he wrote on Truth Social. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, whom Trump appointed in 2018, has previously said he and his colleagues are guided only by economics in their decision-making. During Trump's first term, Powell showed a willingness to ignore Trump's criticism, and last November he said he would not resign if Trump called on him to do so. Powell's term expires in 2026 but could be extended. Bedoya, speaking to NPR, warned that Trump could make that decision for Powell should Humphrey's Executor be overturned. \"People need to understand if I can be removed for any reason at any time, so can Jerome Powell at the Fed,\" said Bedoya. \"And so it's not just about small businesses and consumers. It's also about retirees and investors and their life savings in the stock market.\" Editor's note: Amazon is among NPR's recent financial supporters.

By Akash Sriram (Reuters) - BuildOps said on Friday it has raised $127 million in a late-stage funding round at a valuation of $1 billion, as it looks to scale operations and meet growing demand from contractors for its AI-enabled software platform. The Series C funding round was led by Meritech Capital Partners and saw participation from new investors such as Schneider Electric's SE Ventures and BOND Capital as well as existing investors Fika Ventures and Next47, among others. Advancements in AI and easier access to such technologies have opened avenues for new sectors to improve productivity and reduce costs. BuildOps, which offers a consolidated platform for commercial contractors to manage accounts, customer relationships and other operations, has seen huge demand for its services, the company said. \"The modern contractor that we work with is now going to have the insights from volumes of data that we're putting AI against to try to project cost overruns before they happen,\" Chief Operating Officer John Laino told Reuters. \"Historically, they would have to wait three or four months into a project, and sometimes it was too late to course-correct.\" The company, backed by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, has been growing at a 100% rate for several years and expects to grow at a high rate in the short-to-medium term, CEO Alok Chanani said, adding that going public is part of the vision. He, however, did not specify a timeline. \"We're in a hyper-growth stage today, and so, profitability is not a core focus of the business right now. Our focus is really on growth and investing heavily in R&D and product development and continuing to expand our market reach and customer acquisition,\" Chanani said. The company expects to make strategic acquisitions that could be mutually beneficial. BuildOps had bought PWSWARE, the parent company of software platform Perfectware Solutions, in 2023 for an undisclosed amount.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"ByBrendan Ahern  ByBrendan Ahern,  Senior Contributor.  CLN After the close in Hong Kong, food and restaurant delivery company Meituan (3690 HK) reported Q4 financial results. The company\u2019s press release provides an insight into China\u2019s economy, noting that \u201cthanks to further online penetration and strong consumer demand,\u201d the \u201con-demand delivery business experienced steady growth.\u201d During the earnings call, the company said it would invest in artificial intelligence, drone delivery, and self-driving trucks. The first analyst question was on AI. Chairman and CEO Xing Wang responded: \u201cSo, of course, everyone is very concerned about AI.\u201d He referenced that their in-house large language model has improved customer service and business development by allowing more targeted work. Meituan has also successfully launched in Saudi Arabia. The company provides an interesting look at the detachment of fundamentals from the stock price. In 2019, Meituan generated RMB 97.53 billion worth of revenue, as the stock was trading at HKD 102.5 at year-end. The stock traded at an all-time high of HKD 451.40 on February 17, 2021, falling to a low of HKD 65.40 on January 31, 2024. Big picture: the company has tripled revenue since 2019 but is at 1\/3rd of the all-time high! The company\u2019s P\/E is 26.55 (forward P\/E is 17.92) versus U.S.-listed DoorDash\u2019s P\/E of 246 and India-listed Zomato\u2019s P\/E of 554. Asian equities were mixed. Hong Kong and Mainland China saw another day of profit-taking due to a lack of catalysts, though Indonesia also had a rough night. It felt quiet overnight, though maybe traders skipped town early for the big F1 race in Shanghai this weekend. Trump\u2019s April 2 tariff festival appears to be weighing on investor sentiment as investors lock in profits. Montana Senator Steve Daines is visiting Chinese government officials in Beijing on Friday, which is a good sign, though you would never know it due to the complete lack of Western media coverage of his visit. He is the first U.S. government official to visit China since President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection. While no good news on China ever appears to be fit to print, all negative news must be printed, as Musk\u2019s Pentagon visit front page news. However, Bloomberg News is reporting that U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will speak with Chinese government officials, commenting that \u201cTrump officials are open to a new trade deal, with a possible face-to-face meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping\u201d. Remember, we\u2019ve heard the chatter, though it remains unconfirmed, that Xi will visit Washington, D.C., in June. My Hong Kong stock market heat map from last night looks more like a bloodbath. BYD shares fell -7.69% on an investigation of their Hungary plant by the European Union, which hit autos and electric vehicle ecosystem names, though many of them report Q4 on Monday. Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMIC) fell -7.49%. Precious metals names were hit, as Zijin Mining fell -4.95%. Xiaomi fell -3.19%, Tencent fell -1.54%, and Alibaba fell -3.54%. The selling overnight was fairly indiscriminate, as profits were locked in across sectors. Banks, insurance companies, and brokerages were not spared. Liquor names were off, as Kweichow Moutai fell. Semiconductors, chemicals, and software were all off. We noted yesterday how the Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hang Seng, and Hang Seng Tech indexes were all at big round numbers (3,400; 2,100; 25,000; and 6,000, respectively). The profit-taking has driven the stocks below those levels, with support levels not far. The quarterly Monetary Policy Committee of the People\u2019s Bank of China, China\u2019s central bank, met, stating it would \u201cincrease the intensity of monetary policy regulation\u201d and reduce the bank reserve requirement ratio and interest rates based on \u201cdomestic and foreign economic\u201d conditions, that is when the U.S. Federal Reserve cuts, the PBOC will cut. Mainland media noted how consumer loan interest rates for creditworthy customers have fallen to 2.42%. This could also be a catalyst for consumption, though China\u2019s consumers, and regulators for that matter, have historically been conservative when it comes to consumer credit. The U.S. government agreed to negotiate with both China and Canada at the World Trade Organization following the disputes filed by the latter. The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes fell -2.19% and -3.37%, respectively, on volume that increased +15% from Thursday, which is 206% of the 1-year average. 82 stocks advanced, while 402 stocks declined. Main Board short turnover increased +14% from Thursday, which is 212% of the 1-year average, as 16% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers\u2019 ETF hedging). The value factor and large caps \u201coutperformed\u201d (i.e. fell less than) the growth factor and small caps. All sectors were negative, led lower by Health Care, which fell -0.62%, Materials, which fell -3.75%, and Consumer Discretionary, which fell -3.35%. The top-performing subsectors were construction materials, consumer durables, and apparel. Meanwhile, consumer services, semiconductors, and autos were among the worst-performing subsectors. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were 3X pre-stimulus levels, as Mainland investors bought a net $291 million worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, including China Mobile. However, SMIC, Xpeng, Tencent, Kuaishou, Meituan, Alibaba, and BYD were all net sold within the program. Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board all closed lower by -1.29%, -1.81%, and -2.06%, respectively, on volume that increased by +7.74% from Thursday, which is 130% of the 1-year average. 793 stocks advanced, while 4,247 stocks declined.

All sectors were negative, led lower by Consumer Discretionary, which fell -2.87%, Information Technology, which fell -2.36%, and Materials, which fell -1.64%. The top-performing subsectors were energy equipment, steel, and ports. Meanwhile, autos, leisure products, and computer hardware were among the worst-performing subsectors.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Business Insider Edition  When my husband and I moved our family to Italy last year, I knew life would be different \u2014 a new culture, language, and surroundings \u2014 but what I didn't expect was how much it would change my parenting.          Moving to Italy sounded glamorous, but the reality of it has been different. It's tested and pushed me to grow in ways I never expected. Even in the short time we've been here, I know I am not the same person \u2014 or mom \u2014 that I was when I arrived.               At first, I clutched my kids' little hands tightly, scanning for danger. I moved fast and had lists of sights to see and things to do. I did this all without realizing it; I was just operating on autopilot.               Over time, though, Italy worked its magic on me. I've slowed down, given my kids more independence, and let go of the need to plan every weekend.               Beyond those small shifts, I have grown to feel a deeper kind of relief \u2014 the kind that comes from real, tangible differences between Italian and American society. Here in Bologna, our day care costs are minimal, the food quality is amazing, we walk instead of drive, and I feel welcome and safe with my kids pretty much anywhere.               All of this has made me a calmer, more present version of myself, and my kids benefit from it every day. To break it down, here are five ways Italy has challenged me, changed me, and made me a better mom.               There's a built-in sense of safety in Italy that I never fully felt while living in the Bay Area in the US. It has fewer cars, no ever-present anxiety about gun violence, and a deep belief that kids should be free to explore.               I don't feel the same urge to hover. I let them run freely through piazzas, or I'll watch from a caf patio as my older daughter confidently goes inside to pay.               These moments aren't just about safety \u2014 they're about building independence and trust, which I believe are essential for my children's development.               In Italy, I've found that kids aren't just tolerated, they're adored. My daughters are treated like royalty, to the point that I worry it might go to their heads. In bakeries, they're handed free treats just for being cute.               Strangers stop us on the street with a warm \"Che bella!\" There's a cultural understanding that children will be loud and emotional sometimes, and that's OK. When I'm solo parenting and struggling with them, people step in to make them laugh or distract them from a meltdown.               Because they're so genuinely welcomed everywhere we go, they're growing up knowing that they belong. You see children engaging at restaurants, markets, museums, and even the immigration office, where we're met with patience \u2014 and often, a fast-track line just for families.               Back in the US, our days were often packed with kid-centric activities \u2014 gymnastics, soccer, and endless playdates.               Here, our \"activities\" are simpler: a trip to the market, a lazy afternoon at the park where we run into friends, or a few hours at the stunning local library, which features Roman ruins underneath it.               It's easier to slow down here because kids in Italy are considered a part of life \u2014 life does not revolve around them.               Playgrounds are often next to cafs, for example, so I've learned the joy of sitting with a cappuccino or a spritz while my kids happily play just steps away.               In addition to slowing down, we've loosened up. Italian children stay up late \u2014 sometimes 9, 10, even 11 p.m. \u2014 because family dinners and social gatherings don't pause for bedtime. While we still like to prioritize sleep for our kids, instead of fixating on naps and bedtime schedules,we've become a lot more flexible and taken the pressure off.               Back in California, we lived in the car. There was no escaping it. We'd drive to school, the grocery store, the park, friends' houses, and activities, which all required navigating Bay Area interstates and traffic.               Here, I don't miss driving at all. We walk everywhere. My youngest rides in the stroller or walks and my oldest zips around on her scooter.               It's healthier, more social, and way more fun than sitting in traffic and waging car seat battles. Walking means fresh air, exercise, and passing by independent cafs, small shops, and family-run restaurants, making it easy to support local businesses.               Instead of racing between parking lots, we see where our walks take us \u2014 stopping for an espresso or to peek into a bookstore \u2014 turning errands into a daily rhythm of connection to our neighbors and each other. I have some of my best chats with my kids while we're walking.               Back in California, day care costs were crushing \u2014 totaling more than our mortgage. Here, however, even the private preschool we chose (since we weren't residents in time to enroll in public school) costs about one-eighth of what we paid for day care in the US.               And the meals? Incredible. My daughters eat a three-course lunch every day prepared by an in-school cook who shops at the local market each morning for fresh produce. In the US, I spent so much time scrutinizing labels to avoid ingredients that are banned in the EU.               The biggest relief, though, is feeling more safe. I no longer start my mornings with the silent worry of a school shooting. I was aware of the fear, but it took removing it to fully realize the rush of anxiety at daily drop-offs or whenever the school called me. Not having that thought even cross my mind when I say goodbye to my kids is true freedom.               It's easy to hear, \"We moved to Italy!\" and imagine an effortless dream life of sprawling piazzas and endless gelato. While there are plenty of amazing aspects to our new life, the reality is moving across the world and starting over in a new culture caused our family moments of real struggle.               We enrolled our daughters in a school where none of the children (and virtually no teachers) spoke English. At first, it felt overwhelming. It took a few months before I felt we were all adapting.               Now, my girls are thriving \u2014 speaking Italian, making friends, and soaking up a culture that once felt foreign.               Through it all, they've learned one of life's most valuable lessons: We are resilient and capable of overcoming challenges and obstacles. As a family, we've grown closer by navigating these tough moments together.               Living in Italy hasn't just changed how we spend our time \u2014 it's changed how I feel. I'm less stressed, more present, and free from the financial and safety concerns that had often consumed me in the US. Because of that, my kids are getting a much better version of their mom.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Nike\u2019s (NKE) stock fell about 7% on Friday morning after the shoemaker conceded that President Donald Trump\u2019s new tariffs are putting pressure on its operations, affecting its earnings outlook. The company beat modest earnings expectations for last quarter, reporting $11.3 billion in revenue and 54 cents per share in profit. \u201cGeopolitical dynamics, new tariffs, volatile foreign exchange rates, and tax regulations\u201d are among the challenges Nike faces, CFO Matthew Friend told the earnings call on Thursday. \u201cOur fourth-quarter guidance includes our best assessment of these factors based on the data we have available to us.\u201d That includes the estimated impact of newly implemented tariffs on imports from China and Mexico, Friend said, according to according FactSet\u2019s (FDS) transcript. The 20% duty on imports from China affects about 24% of Nike\u2019s suppliers, which could hurt margins if Nike can\u2019t offset the cost or raise prices. Fourth-quarter gross margins may drop between 400 and 500 basis points, partly due to restructuring charges from last year, Friend added. CEO Elliott Hill didn\u2019t address whether the company would ask its Chinese suppliers to absorb U.S. tariffs \u2014 which retailers including Costco and Walmart have pushed their manufacturers in the country to to do. Nike\u2019s sales in the country dropped 17%, largely on tariffs and weaker consumer demand.  Hill, on the earnings call, said he\u2019d recently visited contractors\u2019 factories and Nike colleagues in Asia to observe supply chain operations, particular involving new product innovations. Hill emphasized strengthening Nike\u2019s culture and focusing on top priorities like sports. Margins remain under pressure as Nike works through inventory challenges, including deep discounts on classic styles, Hill said, but added he\u2019s confident that the company\u2019s renewed focus on sports  is \u201cthe right path forward.\u201d Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

ROBYN BECK\/AFP via Getty Images                                       hide caption  Friday marks the International Day of Forests, as designated by the United Nations. While the world celebrates the many ways trees and forests help sustain human and animal life, deforestation poses a significant threat to these vital ecosystems, both in the United States and abroad. Billions of people across the world rely directly on trees for food and resources, according to the U.N., including in 85% of major cities where forested watersheds provide their freshwater. But, the organization warns that 10 million hectares of forest are intentionally destroyed annually. Another 70 million hectares are impacted by fires, which experts say are being made worse by the ongoing climate crisis. In the United States, efforts from past administrations to better protect the environment, including initiatives to plant more trees, have come under scrutiny by the Trump administration. This month, President Trump signed executive orders aimed at aggressively ramping up the nation's timber production. He framed the importation of wood products as a potential national security threat.  One order issued on March 1 stated, \"The United States faces significant vulnerabilities in the wood supply chain from imported timber, lumber, and their derivative products being dumped onto the United States market.\"   \"Unfair subsidies and foreign government support for foreign timber, lumber, and their derivative products necessitate action under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act to determine whether imports of these products threaten to impair national security,\" it continued Another order, signed on the same day, includes provisions to sidestep the 1973 Endangered Species Act, which seeks to protect the habitats of endangered animals from destruction. And last month, citing the president's pledge to eliminate federal diversity, equity and inclusion programs, the Trump administration decided to rescind an anticipated $75 million in grant funding. This funding would have supported urban areas in planting shade-bearing trees in about 100 cities to help mitigate the effects of climate change. As NPR previously reported, the U.S. Forest Service announced the termination of the program in a letter, stating it \"no longer aligns with agency priorities regarding diversity, equity and inclusion.\" Its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said this decision was made in accordance with President Trump's executive orders. These decisions are already impacting the people who work in related fields. Katherine Wong-Valesco works at Mast Reforestation, a West Coast-based company that replants areas affected by wildfires. Her company, she said, relies on funding from various sources, including landowners who receive government cash to help support their reforestation initiatives. \"Big companies, they're also very cautious about what Trump is trying to do,\" she said. \"When the government is not supporting these kind of initiatives, the companies, they have to be careful. They have no obligation \u2013 it's just some feel good thing that they can put in PR, and now even the government is not supporting.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Business Insider Edition  The Easter Bunny may not need to take out a loan after all.          Egg prices appear on track to be back to normal in time for the holiday, as the USDA says egg production has ramped back up.               For the fourth week in a row, national wholesale prices for large white eggs continued their downward march to $3.27, a new low for the year so far. The volume of eggs processed last week also increased a half percent to its highest level in 3 months.               The numbers reflect a marked improvement in the US egg situation, which saw more than 30 million chickens culled to stop the bird flu outbreak across nine states.               Those supply disruptions pushed wholesale prices to more than $8 a dozen, leading to shortages at grocery stores and surcharges at restaurants.               Still, it will likely take time for retail prices to come down, as they tend to operate with a bit of a delay, University of Central Arkansas economics professor Jeremy Horpedahl told Business Insider.               Horpedahl noted that price increases from the last major avian flu outbreak two years ago took roughly four weeks to unwind as retailers worked through more expensive inventory.               \"The most recent monthly data from BLS was about $6 a dozen, so retailers are selling at six that are paying eight,\" he said. \"I think a lot of them have been taking losses, which might mean they might be a little slower to lower prices in the future.\"               That would suggest grocery store prices could start to come down in the next few weeks as long as no new major outbreaks occur.               The USDA reported no \"significant\" avian flu outbreaks this month, but Horpedahl said some smaller incidents indicate the virus is still circulating.               Meanwhile, other countries, like Canada, have said they've had no trouble with their eggs.                For Canada, NPR reported that agriculture regulations have kept farms smaller and thereby less vulnerable to the kinds of large-scale wipeouts that affected the United States. This also means US eggs ordinarily tend to be cheaper than Canadian ones, plus the country has restrictions on imports of US agricultural products.               Even in the United States, eggs are a regional commodity, so not all cities or states are seeing the same supply and price impacts.               Nearly half of the losses from avian flu this year were concentrated in Ohio alone, followed by Indiana, which was still trying to stamp out infections earlier this month.               \"We're still a month away from Easter,\" Horpedahl said. \"I think that maybe by then, you could actually be seeing retail prices start to fall, or at least the supply chains will have caught up to where you won't have the shortages.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Business Insider Edition  In its latest AI challenge, Apple is facing a false advertisement lawsuit citing delays in delivering its artificial intelligence features.          The complaint, filed Wednesday by Malibu-based Clarkson Law Firm in the US District Court in San Jose, accuses Apple of unfair competition, false advertising, and negligent misrepresentation.               \"Consumers are excited about AI, and unfortunately that has led to Big Tech overpromising and underdelivering,\" Timothy Giordano, a partner at Clarkson Law Firm, said in a statement to Business Insider.               The plaintiffs in the class action suit, led by customer Peter Landsheft and other iPhone 16 owners, said Apple took \"advantage of consumers' desire for cutting-edge artificial intelligence software and features on their phones,\" and didn't deliver on all of the Apple Intelligence tools that were announced ahead of its iPhone 16 launch.               Since the September rollout, the iPhone 16 has been advertised as the first iPhone \"built for AI,\" and Apple Intelligence appears in a number of ads for the device. The tech is only available on iPhone 15 Pro models or later; the iPhone 16 lineup starts at $799.               But in a rare move, Apple announced earlier this month that Siri's planned AI upgrade, which was demonstrated months before the latest iPhone released, would take longer than expected. The plaintiffs referenced an ad from September featuring actor Bella Ramsey using a more personalized version of Siri.               Now, it's facing claims that it \"overstated AI capabilities, leading consumers to believe they were purchasing a device with features that did not exist or were materially misrepresented,\"the lawsuit says.               The tech giant introduced Apple Intelligence almost a year ago at the Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2024. Apple showcased an AI-powered iPhone with tools for writing and editing photos, among other genAI capabilities set to release that fall.               Apple Intelligence launched in October, one month after the iPhone 16 came out. The complaint says \"Apple's mirage of innovation\" included a personalized Siri assistant that can handle complex tasks and cross-reference iOS apps, a feature that Apple said will roll out in the \"coming year.\"               Apple's play to catch up with AI rivals like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, and boost iPhone sales has also incited criticism of what it's delivered so far and questions about what's to come.               In 2024, \"Apple showed a demo, and it only does demos when things are nearly done, and it said it would ship 'later this year' and it never misses deadlines like that. So we should be using it, today,\" analyst Benedict Evans wrote in a blog post.               Internally, it seems that Apple is making changes to get things moving along in the AI department. Bloomberg reported Wednesday that Vision Pro creator Mike Rockwell would replace AI head John Giannandrea in overseeing Siri.               Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.               The suit itself may not be enough to hurt Apple shares, but spotlighting its \"failure\" to deliver an AI-boosted Siri on time is a \"threat to Apple's market value,\" Forrester analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee told BI.               Apple has no place to hide now that competitors' genAI chatbots are up and running, he added.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"ByDavid Trainer  ByDavid Trainer,  Contributor.  stack of silver coins with trading chart in financial concepts and financial investment business ... More stock growth Tariffs have been a hot topic since President Trump started his second term, and many investors are worried about the long-term consequences. On the surface it\u2019s a simple idea, if we tax foreign imports, we will strengthen our own industries by creating more jobs and generating more cash. But, it doesn\u2019t always work so simply. When president Trump instituted tariffs on foreign steel in order to protect U.S. blue collar jobs in 2018, researchers estimate U.S steel producers added about 1,000 new jobs. However, the knock-on effects, namely input costs for U.S. industries that use steel, resulted in an estimated 75,000 fewer manufacturing jobs. The ongoing tariffs, and the uncertainty surrounding additional tariffs, will continue to stoke market volatility. Finding strong businesses with cheap valuations is hard enough, and new trade policies and tariffs only make that job more difficult. That\u2019s where New Constructs steps in. Even in volatile markets, my team scours the entire market to find the best investment opportunities. Diligence matters, now more than ever, especially in a new Golden Era of Investing. Today\u2019s free stock pick provides a summary of how I pick stocks for the Safest Dividend Yields Model Portfolio. This Model Portfolio only includes stocks that earn an attractive or very attractive rating, have positive free cash flow and economic earnings, and offer a dividend yield greater than 3%. Companies with strong free cash flow (FCF) provide higher quality and safer dividend yields because strong FCF is proof they have the cash to support the dividend. I think this portfolio provides a uniquely well-screened group of stocks that can help clients outperform. Shell, PLC (SHEL) is the featured stock in our Safest Dividend Yields Model Portfolio. Shell has grown revenue and net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) by 1% and 14% compounded annually, respectively, since 2015. The company\u2019s NOPAT margin improved from 3% in 2015 to 9% in the TTM, while invested capital turns remained the same at 0.8 over the same time. Rising NOPAT margins drive the company\u2019s return on invested capital (ROIC) from 3% in 2015 to 8% in the TTM. Figure 1: Shell\u2019s Revenue & NOPAT Since 2015 SHEL Revenue & NOPAT 2015-TTM Shell has increased its regular dividend from $0.32\/share in 2Q20 to $0.72\/share in 1Q25. The current quarterly dividend, when annualized provides a 4.2% dividend yield. The company\u2019s free cash flow (FCF) easily exceeds its regular dividend payments. From 2020 through 3Q24, the company generated $145.7 billion (53% of current enterprise value) in FCF while paying $36 billion in regular dividends. See Figure 2. Figure 2: Shell\u2019s FCF Vs. Regular Dividends Since 2020 SHEL Free Cash Flow & Dividends As Figure 2 shows, this company\u2019s dividends are backed by a history of reliable cash flows. Dividends from companies with low or negative FCF are less dependable since the company would not be able to sustain paying dividends. At its current price of $67\/share, this stock has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 0.5. This ratio means the market expects the company\u2019s NOPAT to permanently fall 50% from TTM levels. This expectation seems overly pessimistic given that the company has grown NOPAT 14% compounded annually over the last eight years and 3% compounded annually over the past decade. Even if the company\u2019s: the stock would be worth $91\/share today \u2013 a 36% upside. In this scenario, the company\u2019s NOPAT would actually fall 3% compounded annually through 2033. Should the company\u2019s NOPAT grow more in line with historical growth rates, the stock has even more upside. Below are specifics on the adjustments I make based on Robo-Analyst findings in this featured stock\u2019s 20-F and 6-Ks: Income Statement: I made nearly $22 billion in adjustments with a net effect of removing just under $9 billion in non-operating expenses. Balance Sheet: I made around $127 billion in adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of over $56 billion. The most notable adjustment was for asset write downs. Valuation: I made over $118 billion in adjustments to shareholder value, with a net decrease of around $52 billion. Other than total debt, the most notable adjustment to shareholder value was for excess cash.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Some of the finest camper vans and motorhomes of Europe are slowly making their way to (or back to) the US market. Westfalia has been one highly visible brand reestablishing an American presence, and Wingamm has been busy carving out its own place in the market for the first time ever. After several years of market research and preparation, Wingamm launched its smallest camper, the Oasi 540.1, in the US earlier this year. It's now preparing to grow out its US lineup with a few larger RVs, including the Oasi 610 GL that boasts more space and features like a hybrid bathroom, bunk beds and a spacious front lounge.  At 213 in (540 cm) long, the Oasi 540.1 is shorter than any new US-market Mercedes-Benz Sprinter or Ford Transit camper van out there. But by installing its own wide monocoque motorhome shell on a bare Ram Promaster chassis, Wingamm is able to couple that short length with a roomier-than-average Class B+ floor plan. So the little Oasi camper van+ ends up shorter and nimbler than a Sprinter or Transit camper van on the road and in the parking lot while serving as a roomy base camp that comfortably sleeps up to four people, no pop-up roof necessary.  The next model up the line in Wingamm's US product road map is the Oasi 610 GL. Like the 540.1, the 610 GL is a Class B+ RV that splits the difference between a camper van and larger Class C or Class A motorhome. At 240 in (610 cm) long, it steps beyond the shortest Sprinter and Transit campers in total length so doesn't boast the same short, sweet maneuverability as the Oasi 540.1, but that means a stretched floor plan for added comfort and convenience.  The effect of the longer design can be felt before you even enter the 610 GL - not just from picking it up visually but because the entry door has shifted forward from the rear corner on the Oasi 540.1 to just in front of the rear axle. That's to make room for a pair of 35 x 79-in (90 x 200-cm) transverse bunk beds stacked up against the rear wall.  When traveling, the lower bunk bed can fold forward to create a partition for the rear storage garage. Accessible via the left- and right-side pass-through doors, this storage garage can carry a small motorcycle, scooter, ebike or bicycles, and an available slide-out ramp helps with loading. Of course, it can also be used for camping gear, tools or whatever else it is you need to bring.  Inside, directly in front of the bunk area, a large wardrobe closet with lower dresser drawer stack is set across from the bathroom. Wider than the 540.1 bathroom, the 610 GL's unit is still technically a wet bath but has a little more division between the ceramic toilet\/sink area and shower, with the multi-panel translucent shower door folding out to close in the shower. So it'll be cozy, but someone could use the sink or toilet while someone else is in the shower, unlike in wet bathrooms where the toilet is essentially part of the shower floor.  To the fore of the entry door, the kitchen block comes equipped with a dual-burner gas stove with hinged lid, sink and 96-L fridge\/freezer. Campers enjoy plenty of space for dining, as Wingamm uses its wider body to put its own stamp on the traditional Class B front dinette. Instead of the usual front-facing two-seat bench, it installs a side-facing sofa with slight wrap, creating space for three people, plus two more on the swivel cab seats. The table can swivel and adjust to accommodate the occupants.  The primary double bed lifts away during the day, using a dual-folding mechanism to drop down above the dining area and kitchen at night. But just because it's a temporary folder doesn't mean it won't provide a comfortable night's sleep; it has a memory foam mattress atop a slatted frame for supple support.  The Oasi 610 GL also sets itself apart from other camper vans and small motorhomes with an underfloor heating system and central security mechanism that locks the vehicle cab doors, motorhome entry and all exterior cabinets at the push of a key fob button.  The Oasi 610 GL is still on track for a 2026 launch, and Wingamm USA announced a US$202,500 starting price this week. Wingamm's single-piece fiberglass-sandwich motorhome shell is built atop a Ram Promaster with 150-in wheelbase. The new 610 GL will be joined in 2026 by an alternative 610 floor plan and two 690 models, offering US buyers a larger variety of Wingamm models from which to choose.  Wingamm also announced this month that it has completed its very first Oasi 540.1 US customer delivery, so the brand has officially moved from \"coming to America\" to here and on the way to camp.

Senior Correspondent Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley has become a leading champion of small economies in global climate discussions. And so I took note at last year\u2019s United Nations climate conference when she said she thought countries should engage then-President elect Trump to try to explain the importance of climate work.\u00a0 \u201cI am not one of those who will come out and say immediately that with the election of President Trump all is gloom and doom,\u201d she said at a fireside chat last November. \u201cWe need to find mechanisms\u2026 to have the conversations.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement Mottley\u2019s position has evolved since then. Trump entered office in January with an aggressive agenda to attack clean energy and end collaboration on climate change. Last week, as delegates from around the world gathered in Barbados for a sustainable energy conference, Mottley instead insisted that small countries would need to find their own way forward. \u201cYou don't spend time or energy praying over what could have been,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we deal with the world as it is.\u201d Across three days of talks at the SEforAll Global Forum in Barbados, Trump barely came up explicitly. It\u2019s not that anyone there underestimated the consequences of his election for global climate progress. Rather, his election has finally sunk in, and attention has turned to paving a path forward\u2014without the U.S.\u00a0 It\u2019s a telling glimpse at how climate discussions may be shifting. The gravitational pull of the U.S. should not be dismissed; some countries will inevitably follow his lead. Nonetheless, if the conversations in Barbados provide any indication, many emerging and developing economies remain eager to forge their own clean energy path.\u00a0\u00a0 The U.S. shadow has always loomed large over international climate collaboration. As the world\u2019s largest economy and only superpower, climate negotiators had to adjust language carefully to respond to the U.S. political context.\u00a0 With the Paris Agreement in place, conversations have largely focused on finance\u2014getting money flowing to energy transition projects, particularly in developing and emerging economies. But despite the central role the U.S. played in setting up the system, U.S. public money never came to represent the lifeblood of international climate finance\u2014even as developing countries and climate advocates insisted that the country owed it to the rest of the world to pay up because of its historical emissions. Even in the climate-friendly Biden Administration, it took significant wrangling for the White House to commit to $11 billion in annual international climate finance. To put that in perspective, developing countries left last year\u2019s U.N. climate talks disappointed that their wealthier counterparts committed only to a total $300 billion in annual climate finance.  In other words, on the finance front, the U.S. isn\u2019t leaving that big of a gap to fill. So where will the money come from? One key area under discussion at the SEforAll forum, where I spoke with officials in the public and private sectors based everywhere from Fiji to Sierra Leone, was so-called south-south collaboration. Instead of looking to the U.S. and Europe to pony up capital, developing and emerging market countries can work together\u2014providing the goods and finance without the help of their wealthier counterparts.\u00a0\u00a0 According to research from the Brookings Institution, trade between Global South countries recently surpassed trade between Global North countries. \u201cThis is a great signal of progress,\u201d Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez, a former foreign minister of Spain who is now the dean of the Paris School of International Affairs at Sciences Po, told me on a panel I moderated at the forum. \u201cIt tells us that there is a new world out there.\u201d Potential sources of finance include development banks located in large emerging economies like Brazil and South Africa. Institutions like the New Development Bank, formed in 2014 by the BRICS nations of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, have financed billions in clean energy development. And, of course, it\u2019s impossible to talk about this financial picture without talking about China. The country\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative has been a source of more than $1 trillion in capital for infrastructure since its inception in 2013. In recent years, the country has increasingly focused its funding on green projects.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Many developing countries have also focused on raising capital locally to fund projects\u2014pushing savings and pension fund money to invest in the local market rather than looking abroad for higher returns.\u00a0 And then there are the new methods of what is often called blended finance. Traditionally, the term refers to a combination of public and private capital where the public money lowers the risk for private investors. More recently, philanthropy has entered the blended finance conversation, playing an increasingly important role providing money  \u201cWe have what we call strange bedfellows, where\u2026 institutional investors are partnering with a philanthropic organization, and together coming up with a blended finance solution that is innovative in approach,\u201d says Ije Ikoku Okeke, who runs catalytic climate capital for the Global South at RMI, a clean energy non-profit. A right-wing populist might not object to this new dynamic. In such a world view, American money should support Americans\u2014leaving other countries to their own devices. But is the U.S. really better off if the rest of the world builds a coalition with Americans on the sidelines?\u00a0 Putting U.S. strategic interests aside, it is a little refreshing to hear a conversation about clean energy in the Global South that doesn\u2019t get bogged down in whether the U.S. is going to live up to its moral responsibility as the world\u2019s biggest historic emitter and instead focuses on solutions.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Business Insider Edition  This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Danielle Howard, 32, who lives with her partner and 13-year-old daughter in northern Indiana. Her family is one of many who rely on food banks for meals. It's been edited for length and clarity.          I make about $100 a month too much to qualify for food stamps. I'm just outside those guidelines, and that's why we started using the food pantry.               When my partner experienced a job loss last year, it greatly affected us financially. I'm a direct support professional \u2014 it's a low-paying job, but it's a very rewarding one. I make $16.64 an hour taking care of people with disabilities.               Living as a low-income family, one of the biggest things I did to save money was to shop at Aldi. They have very low-priced produce and basic pantry staples that you can get compared to other major grocery chains or mom and pop stores. I typically spend about $200 a month to feed my family of three, alongside visiting the food bank.               I post most of my grocery and food pantry hauls on TikTok. I want families to know that it's OK to use their resources. There's no shame in taking advantage of things you need, and food is a basic human right that everyone should have access to.               We get food from our pantry once a month. They give us some toiletries, meat, certain canned goods, and sometimes milk \u2014 but not all pantries have dairy. When I go grocery shopping, I buy the things that we did not get from the pantry, like spices, oils, vinegars, extra protein like beans and chicken, and other cooking essentials. My biggest tip for people visiting a food pantry is to call ahead to check their requirements, hours, and what they have in stock. Google is also going to be your best friend to find resources near you.               My videos had a good response when I first started filming a few years ago, and my platform has grown quicker than I expected. I understand that there are a lot of families that are in the same position as we are \u2014 or maybe even doing worse off \u2014 and I want to show people how to make a meal out of the items they can pick up at the pantry. I want to help others fight food insecurity.               The more that creators start posting their grocery and food pantry experiences, the more it's going to normalize it. Pantries are based around supply and demand. If a community pantry doesn't see enough demand, it will lose the funding it needs to stay open \u2014 so using these resources is a good thing. One of the biggest comments I've heardfrom my followers is that, through the help of pantries, they can better afford healthcare and other expenses because they don't have to spend so much income on groceries.               My local pantry doesn't have income requirements \u2014 they only check your ID and ZIP code \u2014 but some pantries do have income requirements. I would love to see those restrictions lightened in order for more people to be able to access and use those resources.               I wish more people knew that food insecurity can happen to anyone, at any time, at any point in their life. You should never judge someone for trying to eat because you never know if you're going to end up in that situation yourself.       Do you have a story to share about your finances?

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Seven years of support has changed a lot.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  The tech world moves at lightning speed, with new smartphones launching seemingly every other week. It's easy to get caught up in the hype of the latest and greatest, but sometimes, the real value lies in a slightly older, yet still incredibly capable, device. Enter the Google Pixel 8a. While the Pixel 9a will soon be the budget Android champ, the 8a continues to be a compelling option for anyone seeking a great Android experience without spending too much money. I'm not talking about whether or not you should upgrade. I'm saying that if I needed a new phone, I'd buy a Pixel 8a as soon as the price drops with the release of the 9a. One of the most significant selling points of the Pixel 8a was its long-term software support, and that's what makes it the phone I would buy today. Google has pledged a remarkable seven years of OS and security updates for the 8a, mirroring the flagship Pixel 8 series. This means your device will remain secure and up-to-date with the latest Android features well into the 2030s.  This changes things. In the past, buying an older model of Android meant you would probably see the manufacturer drop support for it before you were ready to stop using it. Seven years means you'll be using something else before Google says goodbye to the Pixel 8a. In a market where many mid-range phones receive only a couple of years of support, this extended lifespan is a major advantage. It ensures your investment is protected, and you won't be forced to upgrade prematurely due to software obsolescence. This extended support isn't just about security patches, but it doesn't mean the 8a will be updated to do nearly everything Google dreams up in the future. The Pixel series is renowned for its AI-powered capabilities, from the Magic Editor for photos to the Call Assist features that make communication smoother. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android With seven years of updates, the Pixel 8a will see some feature improvements here and there, but you shouldn't count on anything new. You can, however, know that the phone's software should work as well or better at the end of seven years as it did on day one. That's a big deal.  Beyond the software, the Pixel 8a boasts impressive hardware for the price. The Google Tensor G3 chip, mostly the same processor found in the flagship Pixel 8 and 8 Pro, enables decent performance, fast app loading, and exceptional AI processing. The 8a handles everything I want a phone to do with ease. The camera system is another highlight. The Pixel series has consistently delivered outstanding photography, and the 8a is no exception. Its dual rear camera setup isn't anything particularly special, but Google's computational photography prowess shines through, producing stunning images with accurate colors, excellent dynamic range, and impressive low-light performance. Features like Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur further enhance the photography experience, allowing you to easily edit and improve your photos. The Pixel 8a also features a great display. The OLED panel delivers rich colors and deep blacks, while the 120Hz refresh rate ensures fluid scrolling and animations. The device's compact size and comfortable design make it easy to hold and use, even for extended periods.  Now, let's address the elephant in the room: the Pixel 9a. As with any new smartphone release, the arrival of the 9a will likely lead to a price drop for the Pixel 8a. This makes it an even more attractive option for budget-conscious buyers. The 8a already offers excellent value at its current price, but a further reduction would make it an absolute steal. Everything you've read and heard about the 8a still stands. It's still the same phone it was in 2024, and it will stay that way for seven years. The Google Pixel 8a is far from being outdated. Its long-term software support, capable hardware, excellent camera, and potential price drop make it a compelling choice for anyone looking for a reliable and feature-rich smartphone without breaking the bank.   Last year's gem The Pixel 8a may be last year's model, but Google's impressive software promise and computational photography ensure that this phone will continue to impress even years from now.   The new kid in town The Pixel 8a is still a great phone, but the Pixel 9a offers some notable upgrades over its predecessor, ensuring longer battery life, better readability, and much more. And you still get seven years of software support for this affordable phone Jerry is an amateur woodworker and struggling shade tree mechanic.

Samsung Electronics stock has hit a key level for the first time in five months as investors become hopeful for a recovery in memory demand. Reading time: 2 minutes Investors haven't had the best of time being long on Samsung Electronics stock recently as the lack of a catalyst has kept prices subdued. Concerns about the company's challenges in the semiconductor market have also impacted prices, and with no clear path out of the quagmire just yet, investors aren't willing to push the stock any higher.   However, there appears to be some cautious optimism from investors, as the Samsung stock has now recovered to the 60,000 won (~$40) range. It's hit this trading range after five months on the back of hopes that demand for memory chips will increase across the smartphone and PC segments.  Samsung Electronics stock has traded up in multiple sessions this week, rising another 2.9% on Thursday and closing out the session at 60,200 won. This is the first time that the stock price has breached the 60,000 won limit since October 2024.  The stock still has a lot of catching up to do from the high of 87,800 won (~$60) in July 2024. It has consistently declined since then, hitting a 4-year low at one point in November 2024, as investors grew increasingly concerned about the lack of progress on major high-bandwidth memory orders and yield issues at the foundry.  Investors are now pricing in a demand recovery for memory chips, with an expectation that average selling prices for DRAM and NAND flash products will increase, thereby helping Samsung recoup some of the billions that it has lost in revenues over the past year. Some are also holding out on hope that Samsung will ultimately win orders for its HBM3E memory modules from NVIDIA, though that seems easier said than done at this stage.  Making a case for the bulls to get behind this stock, major US investment bank Morgan Stanley has already raised its price target for Samsung Electronics stock this week to 70,000 won.

The following is the official response sent to Digital Trends by Samsung: \u201cSamsung Electronics has identified a software update error as the cause of the operational issue affecting certain 2024 soundbar devices. We are taking immediate action to resolve the situation. Samsung is offering free repairs for all affected units\u2014regardless of warranty status.\u201d Earlier in the month, Samsung released firmware update 1020.7 that rendered the Q990D soundbar inoperable. Reports from users on the\u00a0r\/soundbars on Reddit,\u00a0Samsung forums, and\u00a0AVS Forum were posting about the update causing the soundbar to get stuck in eARC mode with no way to get it working again. (The story was originally reported by The Verge.) A moderator on the European Samsung forums messaged saying that Samsung AV Product Specialists were aware of the issue and an OTN (Over the Network) update was the cause of the bricking, and that the OTN update was suspended. Apparently the firmware update did not affect users that initiated the update over USB. That original post from the Samsung forum moderator continued, \u201cIf your issue is the result of an OTN update, then it will be necessary to arrange an engineer\u2019s inspection and repair in order to get this resolved.\u201d Samsung\u2019s official statement above doesn\u2019t specifically indicate that non-working units will need to be sent in for repair instead of a new firmware fix being forced to resolve the problem, but if they do, at the very least it sounds as though Samsung will cover the cost. Astell&Kern (A&K) has announced its latest portable digital audio player (DAP) and it not only boasts a huge number of audiophile-friendly features, but it also ships with a home charging dock that doubles as a two-channel analog source for hi-fi systems. The A&K PS10 will officially debut at CanJam Singapore, 5 \u2013 6 April 2025 and be available at authorized Astell&Kern dealers worldwide in May 2025 for $2,500. The PS10 is a departure for A&K's portables. The company has seemingly ditched the highly angular chassis designs of its previous players, in favor of a far more conventional, smartphone-like appearance. Fans of A&K's portables will note another major change on the PS10: the absence of a rotary knob for volume control, something every A&K player has featured, going back to its debut product -- the AK100 -- from 2012, with the exception of the budget-friendly, Activo-branded, P1.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Investors in the troubled aerospace giant Boeing (BA) received some good news on Friday when President Donald Trump awarded it a contract to build \u201ca lot\u201d of F-47 fighter jets for the U.S. Air Force \u2014 and possibly its allies. Boeing stock rose more than 6.5% on the news, hitting $183.10 per share as of 1:50 p.m. New York time. The plane maker\u2019s stock has risen 6.53% since the start of the year.  The crewed jets will share airspace with military drones and replace the Lockheed Martin-built (LMT) F-22 Raptor, according to Reuters (TRI), which pegged the initial price of the \u201cNext Generation Air Dominance\u201d project at $20 billion. After announcing the Boeing contract, Trump told reporters the U.S. has \u201cgiven an order for a lot\u201d of F-47 jets and declined to confirm their price.  The F-47 will be cheaper and \u201cmore adaptable to future threats,\u201d said General David Allvin, the Air Force\u2019s chief of staff. Boeing has struggled to right itself ever since a 2024 door-plug blowout on a 737 Max 9 triggered a federally mandated production slowdown. Boeing told investors in January that it lost $11.8 billion last year, during which stalled machinists\u2019 strike talks further restricted the company\u2019s output; meanwhile, issues with Boeing\u2019s delayed Starliner spacecraft transformed an eight-day visit to the International Space Station into a nine-month spectacle. The family of Boeing whistleblower John Barnett hit Boeing with a wrongful death lawsuit on Wednesday. Boeing\u2019s stock climbed earlier in the week when chief financial officer Mark West said the company was making progress on manufacturing and downplayed the impact of tariffs on demand. However, West indicated on Wednesday that tariffs may ultimately limit the company\u2019s access to plane parts. Broadly, tariffs are expected to slow U.S. economic growth and drive up costs for consumers, but investors don\u2019t seem to buy that a recession is inevitable.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk acknowledged the trouble his EV giant has had in recent months, but urged staff to \u201chang onto your stock\u201d during an all-hands meeting on Thursday. Musk talked late on Thursday night from the company\u2019s Texas gigafactory in a meeting that was streamed on his social media site X. He tried to encourage workers as Tesla stock has tanked over 50% in the past three months.  \u201cIf you read the news, it feels like Armageddon,\u201d Musk said, referencing recent attacks on Tesla dealerships. \u201cI can\u2019t walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire. You\u2019re like \u2014 what is going on?\u201d he added. \u201cI understand if you don\u2019t want to buy our product, but you don\u2019t have to burn it down. That\u2019s a bit unreasonable.\u201d Despite the challenges, Musk\u2019s central message to employees was clear: hold onto your shares. Tesla stock is down roughly 2% this week and has plunged 33% over the past month \u2014 and by more than half from its all-time high in mid-December. The selloff has erased billion of dollars from Musk\u2019s net worth, about 60% of which is tied to Tesla shares and options. And the wipeout comes as Musk \u2014 by his own admission \u2014 has struggled to balance his role as Tesla\u2019s chief executive while leading several other companies and the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Some analysts suggest Musk\u2019s close ties to President Donald Trump have also contributed to Tesla\u2019s woes. The DOGE initiative has garnered ill will from the very people who made up Tesla\u2019s original customer base.  \u201cIf you agree or disagree with DOGE it misses the point that by Musk spending 110% of his time with DOGE (and not as Tesla CEO) since President Trump got back into the White House this has essentially turned Tesla into a political symbol.... and this is a bad thing,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, a prominent Tesla bull, wrote in a Wednesday note to investors. Tesla has borne the brunt of the outrage as hundreds of protestors across the world, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, protest against Musk. Projections for the company\u2019s first quarter sales have taken a hit and a major auto show removed Tesla from its lineup to avoid protests. \u2014William Gavin contributed to this article.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"ByMoneyShow  ByMoneyShow,  Contributor.  A 10% correction in the S&P 500. A host of new tariff threats. A closely watched Federal Reserve meeting. Investors have had a LOT on their plates. So, where do markets go NEXT? What stocks and funds look the most promising? Top MoneyShow expert contributors weigh in this week. Lawrence McMillan Option Strategist A short-term buy signal for the S&P 500 (SPX) was triggered at Friday\u2019s close: The \u201coscillator differential\u201d buy signal. This occurs when the two breadth oscillators, which had spread far apart in recent weeks, come back within 200 points of each other.. Historically, this has been a reliable short-term, one-week buy signal. For those unfamiliar with this indicator, it\u2019s based on the divergence and convergence of two key market breadth oscillators\u2014the NYSE-based oscillator and the \u201cstocks only\u201d oscillator. These signals have provided strong short-term trading opportunities in the past. SPX Stocks Only Still, in the longer term, equity-only put-call ratios have been racing upwards, with put buying very heavy last week. Both remained on sell signals for the stock market since they are rising. The weighted ratio reached the heights of last summer. But it is not the level of the ratio that is important...it's the direction and that is still upward. These put-call ratios won't generate buy signals until they roll over and begin to trend lower. In summary, we have only one buy signal confirmed, but we expect to see more in the next few days. The ensuing rally is likely to carry upwards to about 5,900 and then run into more trouble. We have been rolling deeply in-the-money puts down and will continue to do so where appropriate. Jeff Hirsch The Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac Tip-for-tap tariff policy has economic uncertainty swelling \u2013 and the market retreating in a manner that some are already comparing to Covid-19 and 2020. This seems like a reasonable comparison...but now is not 2020. I believe many of the market\u2019s current concerns could be alleviated. It could even happen just as quickly as the problems arose, with more clarity and perhaps a slower pace. When (could the correction end) and where (a possible S&P 500 level) are two questions we would like to have answers to as the S&P 500 slips deeper into correction territory. To gain some potential prospective on the when, we compiled some data on post-inaugural market performance. Aside from confirming the current market retreat has been tough, the table also showed us that this has not been the worst post-inaugural performance. Recent history shows 2009 and 2001 were even worse. S&P 500 performance Transforming the data into a chart showing the 30 trading days before and the 100 trading days after the inauguration dates resulted in the chart here. Please note: There are an average of 21 trading days per month. In addition to the \u201cAll\u201d line, we separated out past Republicans and past Democrats. Performance has been adjusted to set zero on Inauguration Day. Trump 2.0 is the current S&P 500 performance as of the March 13 close. The weak market performance by Republicans in the chart is consistent with post-election year performance by party found on page 28 of the 2025 Almanac. Trump 2.0 does appear to be tracking the Republican line fairly closely, although the magnitude of this year\u2019s S&P 500 decline is greater. Should the S&P 500 continue to track the historical Republican line, an initial low\/bottom could occur in the second half of March \u2013 with a potential retest in sometime possibly in early April. Then the S&P 500 could begin to recover like it historically did under past Republican presidents. Jay Pelosky TPW Advisory The enthusiasm and euphoria that greeted the Trump election win, especially among the retail investor base, has been replaced by retail sentiment at levels last seen at the bottom of the 2022 bear market. Additionally, rotation is the lifeblood of bull markets and today, the rotation is global \u2013 from the US to the rest. ETFs like the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) are benefitting. Crypto \u2013 THE Trump trade (we thought so, too) \u2013 has fallen like a stone alongside many growth and hype stocks and segments. Remember the Trump coin? The Melania coin? Down 90%. Stock market weakness has been concentrated in the Mag 7, which took a shot to the heart with the advent of Deep Seek, something we have discussed at length. The shift out of Mag 7 and into China tech funds like the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB), has been one of the fastest, cleanest, and clearest examples of rotation we have ever seen. Tech Rotation Then there is the strong relative performance of the non-US equity markets over the past two weeks, with the iShares MSCI EAFE ETF (EFA) and EEM holding above their 200-day moving averages while the S&P, QQQs, and others broke well below. That is a testimony to the global equity rotation under way. Rotation is the lifeblood of bull markets and here the rotation is global, from the US to the rest. China Allocations We continue to strongly favor non-US equity and remain overweight both Europe and Asia. Our focus is on large caps, banks (loan growth, fewer defaults, more M&A), and defense in Europe, and a Japanese focus in Asia. We also remain overweight EM equity with a strong focus on China, both large cap and tech. We have held these positions for some time in our Global Multi Asset (GMA) model, except for EU defense which we added last month. We would use rips in US equity to reduce positions and employ dips in non-US as opportunities to add.","label":1}

The AI assistant now features a new web search tool that allows users to access current events and information to enhance their results. The new search feature provides direct citations, allowing you to verify sources easily. Furthermore, Claude organizes and presents relevant sources in a conversational format, making the results easier to digest. Anthropic states that the new search feature is handy for various users and use cases. These include sales teams seeking to analyze industry trends, financial analysts looking for up-to-date market data, and researchers who need content for grant proposals and literature reviews. Additionally, everyday shoppers can benefit from the tool as it helps them compare product features and prices. At launch, Claude\u2019s web search capabilities were only available to premium customers based in the U.S. Additionally, they only worked with Claude 3.7 Sonnet. This model is the company\u2019s first that can provide quick responses and step-by-step problem-solving. Claude Pro is priced at $20 per month or $214.99 per year. The new search tool was hinted at about a month ago. Incorporating web search capabilities for real-time information gathering is a significant advancement in AI. OpenAI introduced this feature in ChatGPT late last year, initially making it available only to paying subscribers. Now, it is accessible to everyone at no cost. While there are no guarantees, it would not be surprising if Claude eventually offered web search for free as well. Claude can be accessed from its website, iOS and Android apps, and\u00a0desktop versions. Claude first went online in December 2022 when Anthropic released it as a limited beta product for a small group of users. This initial release was part of a closed beta that showcased Claude\u2019s capabilities to early testers. Claude\u2019s first widely available version was launched in March 2023, when Anthropic released it to a broader audience through an API and partnerships with companies such as Quora\u2019s Poe and other platforms. Anthropic has thrown its hat in the race to establish an AI-based web search feature, which it announced on Thursday. The feature is based on Anthropic\u2019s Claude 3.7 Sonnet model and integrates web search into the chatbot tool. You can enable the feature in your profile settings. With an AI prompt, you will receive contextual results with search engine sources included, instead of just the link options you would receive in a standard search result. The web search feature will be available, first to paid U.S. customers and will roll out to additional users at a later time. Imagine putting your name into ChatGPT to see what it knows about you, only for it to confidently -- yet wrongly -- claim that you had been jailed for 21 years for murdering members of your family.

Second, Anthropic claims to take a more responsible approach with its AI chatbot -- and eponymous large language models -- Claude, attempting to eliminate harmful or unethical responses.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"ByBenjamin Adams  ByBenjamin Adams,  Contributor.   DENVER, CO - MAY 14: Mazatec psilocybin mushrooms during their 3 day drying time after harvest in ... More Denver, Colorado. (Photo by Joe Amon\/MediaNews Group\/The Denver Post via Getty Images) The use of psychedelic mushrooms is on the rise, and a new report confirms the expansion of the market with growing interest in psilocybin and its potential applications in therapy. Persistence Market Research announced its report on Monday. The findings show that the global psychedelic mushrooms market is on a rapid growth trajectory. The projection is based primarily on products made from three genera of mushrooms\u2014Psilocybe, Gymnopilus, and Panaeolus\u2014which produce psilocybin and psilocin. Researchers estimate the psychedelic mushroom market will reach a valuation of $3.3 billion by the end of 2031, a significant increase from $1.5 billion in 2024. People turn to these mushrooms to treat conditions ranging from addiction to anxiety and depression. Persistence Market Research, based in England and Wales, specializes in research studies across multiple industries. Ms. Sayali Sheth, senior consultant of food and beverage at Persistence Market Research, said the market is poised for substantial growth. \u201cPersistence Market Research forecasts robust growth in the Psychedelic Mushrooms Market,\u201d Sheth told Forbes in an email. \u201cAs per a recent research study by Persistence Market Research, the Psychedelic Mushrooms Market is on the cusp of substantial growth. The emergence of psychedelic drugs as medicines is a key terminus in mental healthcare advancements, with an upswing in successful clinical trials, positive regulatory approvals, capital investment inflow, and growing public awareness. Pharmaceutical companies are wary of the challenges in manufacturing, market access, clinical, and regulatory spaces. They are allocating resources to make psychedelics mainstream and consolidate their market position. The potential for medical advancements and product innovation presents significant opportunities for the market players in the psychedelic mushrooms sector, despite the challenges such as legal restrictions, safety concerns, and cultivation complexities.\u201d Researchers hope the future of psychedelic mushroom-assisted therapy includes better classification of strains. \u201cOptimi Health Corp., in collaboration with Kwantlen Polytechnic University Applied Genomics Centre, is leveraging cutting-edge genomics technology to examine the genetics of mushrooms that contain psilocybin. This research is aimed at encouraging innovation in psychedelic drugs by improving strain identification and optimizing cultivation techniques efficiently,\u201d Sheth said. The report projects that the market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.3% between 2024 and 2031. Factors impacting this growth include a rising demand due to increasing research on psychedelic-assisted therapy, continually changing regulations, and growing awareness of its potential therapeutic benefits. A representative said the data was gathered from the company websites, white papers, journal articles, newspaper editorials, regulatory organizations and the Persistence Market Research database. LITTLETON, CO - DECEMBER 13 : Psilocybin mushroom of AJNA BioSciences' cultivation facility in ... More Littleton, Colorado on Wednesday, December 13, 2023. (Photo by Hyoung Chang\/The Denver Post) The report lists key market players in the psychedelic mushroom industry as MindMed, Herbalife Nutrition Ltd., Atai Life Sciences, Johnson & Johnson, Compass Pathways, Cybin Inc., Revive Therapeutics, Numinus Wellness, Red Light Holland, and Axsome Therapeutics Inc. Companies like Red Light Holland are making strides in product development in this field. In April 2024, the company shipped natural psilocybin truffles from its farm in the Netherlands to Crest Labs in Canada. They explained that the psilocybin truffles from Red Light Holland are used in an experimental research study to develop a process for commercially producing a naturally sourced API. \u201cIndustry events like the Psychedelics as Medicine conference are vital for collaboration and partnerships between researchers, therapists, and industry leaders,\" Sheth said. \"They are promoting education about psychedelic treatments, showcasing new developments and therapeutic uses. In addition, these events attract investors looking to finance psychedelic research, along with foundations that support the development of psychedelic medicine and its integration into mainstream healthcare.\" One of the biggest potential advancements in psilocybin mushrooms is its effects on treatment-resistent depression. In addition, researchers recently found that psilocybin may mimic effects of a popular antidepressant drug escitalopram. Beyond its potentials in medicine, psilocybin-infused foods could open up a market in functional foods. Significant regulatory hurdles remain, while a handful of states and smaller jurisdictions in the U.S. have decriminalized mushrooms. A surge of interest in psychedelic mushroom-assisted therapy has swept the U.K. as well. \u201cA key challenge to psychedelic mushroom uptake might be that licensed medical providers cannot legally give patients psilocybin-containing mushrooms under federal law,\" Sheth said. \"However, Oregon and Colorado have state-approved programs that allow patients to access these products. As a result, seriously ill patients may approach doctors with the risks and benefits associated with psychedelic mushrooms, even though these therapies are not part of standard medical care.\" The report is more optimistic than similar findings in 2023 on the forecast of the Psychedelic Mushroom Market and its estimated CAGR through 2032, showing a growing interest in psilocybin and its applications.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"You can also collect the figures on the second-hand market, which sounds like Pok\u00e9mon with extra steps.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  When I was just a boy, my father dutifully collected a set of Natwest pigs, hopeful that one day they may be worth enough for my first rent payment. Spoiler: They were not. Anyway, according to reports (via HKEPC), MSI has launched a promotion whereby Taiwanese residents who collect nine Lucky Dragon figurines can exchange them for an RTX 5080 at retailer Taiwan Original Price House, which is much better than the first month's payment on a soggy British flat. The catch? The primary way of obtaining them is by, err, buying a particular launch edition of MSI's RTX 50-series GPU range, which is no easy feat at this point given the MSRP markups and shortage of stock faced by would-be RTX 50-series buyers. The figures are included with MSI's Vanguard range of RTX 50-series GPUs, one per unit, and amount to ten in total\u2014nine cute dragons and one slightly ominous Moai-statue-headed special edition model.  I told you it was ominous. Regardless, this has apparently created something of a second-hand market for the dragons-do-dress-up figures, as a Taiwanese buyer who alerted others to the deal has reportedly offered NT$4,000 for a particular model. That's around $121 at the current exchange rate\u2014although should this particular GPU-seeking hopeful use it to complete their set, it represents a mere fraction of the cost of an RTX 5080, even at its $999 MSRP. According to Videocardz, a large number of these Vanguard RTX 50-series GPUs were sent out to reviewers, although apparently we missed out by reviewing an MSI RTX 5070 Ti Gaming Trio instead of the Vanguard edition. Had we known there was a potentially valuable figurine included, we would have\u2026 reviewed the same card, to be honest. Journalistic integrity and all that, but who doesn't love some extra tat? Especially when there's a very expensive and hard-to-obtain GPU on the line. This whole endeavour has caused me to root around on my figurine-strewn shelves, certain in the knowledge that I had an MSI dragon figurine somewhere from various launch events I've attended over the past few years. And lo and behold I do:  It's this little fella, and he's worth precisely nothing. Well, that seems unfair\u2014he's certainly worth a place on my heart, and indeed my shelves. He's not part of the promotion though, so back he goes, next to my well-thumbed sci-fi novel collection and various dubiously-titled books from my partner's political science course. Sigh. Better luck next time, ey? Still, if you're reading and you do happen to own a Dragon Lucky figurine, it might be time to list it on the second-hand market.

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Tesla dealerships have faced attacks since Elon Musk began his White House role. President Donald Trump seemed to issue a warning to individuals who participate in Tesla vandalisms, as reports of destruction to vehicles, dealerships and charging stations surge across the country. Early Friday morning, Trump posted on his social media platform: \"People that get caught sabotaging Teslas will stand a very good chance of going to jail for up to twenty years, and that includes funders. WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU!!!\" He also suggested those found guilty of participating in Tesla-related crimes could be sent to prison in El Salvador, referring to the administration's controversial move to deport alleged gang members to the country after Trump signed a proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act even though a court order temporarily blocked the authority. \"I look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20 year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla,\" Trump said in a posting. \"Perhaps they would serve them in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions.\" Recent attacks aimed at Tesla have been reported in Seattle, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Charleston and other cities across the United States since Tesla CEO Elon Musk began his role with the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. In a public announcement Friday evening, the FBI said incidents targeting Teslas have been recorded in at least nine states since January, including arson, gunfire and graffiti. \"These criminal actions appear to have been conducted by lone offenders, and all known incidents occurred at night,\" the FBI said in the public service announcement. \"Individuals require little planning to use rudimentary tactics, such as improvised incendiary devices and firearms, and may perceive these attacks as victimless property crimes.\" The FBI urged the public to be vigilant and to look out for suspicious activity in areas around Tesla dealerships. When asked about his comments at the White House on Friday afternoon, Trump called the vandalism suspects \"terrorists\" and appeared to argue what was happening with Tesla vehicles was worse than what happened during the Jan. 6 riots at the Capitol. \"You didn't have that on Jan. 6, I can tell you. You didn't have anything like that on Jan. 6, which is sort of amazing,\" Trump said. Three people have been charged for their alleged involvement in recent attacks against Tesla properties in Salem, Oregon; Loveland, Colorado; and North Charleston, South Carolina. Adam Lansky of Salem was charged with illegally possessing an unregistered destructive device on March 5, Lucy Grace Nelson of Lyons, Colorado, was charged with one count of malicious destruction of property on Feb. 27 and Daniel Clarke-Pounder of North Charleston was charged with arson on March 15, according to federal prosecutors. Both Lansky and Clarke-Pounder have not entered any pleas, but Nelson pleaded not guilty on March 11, according to court records. Attorney General Pam Bondi also spoke out against the Tesla vandalisms, saying on Thursday the three suspects will face the \"full force of the law\" for allegedly using Molotov cocktails to set fire to the electric vehicles and charging stations. \"The days of committing crimes without consequence have ended,\" Bondi said in a statement. \"Let this be a warning: if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.\" More Tesla incidents continue to pop up across the country, with the latest occurring in Fargo, North Dakota, early Friday morning, where fire crews found \"a small fire in wood chips at the base of the electric vehicle chargers in the parking lot,\" according to the Fargo Fire Department. Officials said the fire is considered \"suspicious\" and the cause of the fire is under investigation. It is unclear whether the fire damaged the chargers, authorities said. The New York City Police Department is also asking for the public's help in identifying two men who spray-painted a swastika on a Cyber Truck on Thursday. The incident is being investigated by the NYPD's Hate Crime Task Force. In addition to the company dealing with the recent attacks, Tesla's stocks have tumbled nearly 48% this year and in recent weeks, four top officers at the company have sold off $100 million in stock, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Musk, the owner of X, reposted reactions to Trump's comments on Friday, including one that said \"ESPECIALLY the funders\" should be held responsible for these attacks. A spokesperson for Tesla did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":0}

Published onMarch 21, 2025  While Samsung, Motorola, and other Android brands have already established a strong foothold in the foldable market, Apple is looking to break into the segment with its own device. As Apple continues development on this foldable iPhone, some new details have emerged, and they could have market-wide implications. According to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple is planning to use Liquidmetal, which is manufactured using a die-casting process, in the hinges of its foldable iPhone. Apple reportedly decided to use this material for the purpose of increasing durability, maximizing screen flatness, and minimizing the screen crease. For this, Dongguan EonTec has been tapped to be Apple\u2019s exclusive supplier. The Cupertino-based firm has previously used Liquidmetal for smaller components like SIM ejector pins. However, this would be the first time Apple has used the material for such a critical mechanical part. This move likely won\u2019t go unnoticed by Apple\u2019s competitors. Kuo predicts that Android foldable phone makers will follow Apple\u2019s lead and also adopt Liquidmetal. This way they\u2019ll be more prepared to compete against this foldable iPhone. As a result, Kuo believes there will be major growth in the Liquidmetal market. On top of the hinge news, a leak from tipster yeux1122 claims Apple is focusing on improving battery life and slimming the foldable down. In order to accomplish this, the company is said to be refining the display driver IC (DDI). This component converts digital signals from the processor to analog signals used to control the pixels on the screen. Improving the DDI could allow Apple to produce a thinner panel, while also reducing heat and power consumption.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-21","content":"Amid mounting concerns about what his White House role means for his day job as Tesla chief executive officer, the world\u2019s richest man Elon Musk convened Tesla employees for a livestreamed all-hands meeting late Thursday, urging them to \u201chang on to your stock\u201d in the carmaker as it navigates a chilly three-month stretch, helping ignite a rally for shares of the automaker. Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks from the Oval Office last month. Musk coyly addressed Tesla stock\u2019s 51% dive from its December record through Thursday, saying the company is amid \u201ca little bit of stormy weather\u201d and \u201cif you read the news, it feels like Armageddon,\u201d mentioning the widespread protests at Tesla showrooms and vandalism of the vehicles. \u201cTesla stock goes up and it goes down, but actually it\u2019s still the same company,\u201d said Musk, adding, \u201cI guess it\u2019s just very emotional.\u201d Shares of Tesla rose nearly 4% by mid-afternoon Friday even as the S&P 500 declined slightly, though the stock is still down 2% since last Friday, heading toward its ninth consecutive losing week. The surprise event marked Musk\u2019s most prominent appearance with Tesla since the company\u2019s Jan. 26 earnings call as the billionaire dedicated much of his time working for the Trump administration, and the all-hands notably came just hours after one of the most well-known bullish analysts covering the company, Wedbush\u2019s Dan Ives, insisted Musk \u201cstep up, stop being silent, and help resolve this crisis forming at Tesla.\u201d But \u201clast night was the type of leadership Musk needed to show,\" Ives credited in a Friday note to clients, applauding Musk for \u201cshowing important hand holding at this key time for employees and investors.\u201d  \u201cI have like 17 jobs, at this point,\u201d Musk said Thursday, adding he\u2019s \u201cstretched pretty thin.\u201d In addition to his role at Tesla, Musk is the de facto head of the White House\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, the CEO of multibillion-dollar private firms SpaceX aeronautics and xAI artificial intelligence, chairman and owner of the social media firm X and the founder of the startups Boring Company and Neuralink, which focus on tunneling and brain implants, respectively. Since President Donald Trump took office in January, Musk has dedicated \u201c110%\u201d of his time with DOGE, a role with its heavy influence in Trump\u2019s goal to slash civil service jobs and government funding which has proven controversial for its often misleading claims about targeted programs. That negative sentiment toward Musk\u2019s outspoken politics has resulted in a significant headwind for Tesla sales to start 2025, leading a host of Wall Street firms to lower their price targets for Tesla stock and cut their forecasts for vehicle deliveries in 2025. Tesla\u2019s \u201csales woes\u201d are a result of declining \u201cbrand perception\u201d in the U.S. and the European Union, Mizuho analysts wrote this week. As Tesla\u2019s largest shareholder, nobody has been hit harder by Tesla stock\u2019s selloff in terms of sheer value than Musk, whose net worth is down nearly $140 billion from its December apex. Musk\u2019s $328 billion fortune is still by far the largest of any human, according to our estimates, though for the first time since 2019, it\u2019s SpaceX, not Tesla, that\u2019s the leading source of his wealth.
