{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Business Insider Edition  Sam Altman is ramping up his advice for students preparing to enter a workforce that's increasingly automating coding: master AI tools.          \"The obvious tactical thing is just get really good at using AI tools,\" Altman said in a Thursday interview with Stratechery's Ben Thompson. \"Like when I was graduating as a senior from high school, the obvious tactical thing was get really good at coding. And this is the new version of that.\"                Using AI to write code has become a major topic among tech executives.               Dario Amodei, the CEO of\u00a0Anthropic,\u00a0predicted last week that AI would\u00a0write 90% of code\u00a0within six months and \"essentially all of the code\" in a year. Kevin Weil, OpenAI's chief product officer, predicted this week that AI will become better than humans at coding by the end of the year.                With the conversation about AI replacing human software engineers ramping up \u2014 especially as more people embrace vibe coding \u2014 Altman has doubled down on advice he gave in a September interview that mastering AI tools is a way to future-proof your career.               \"I think in many companies, it's probably past 50% now,\" Altman said in the Stratechery interview, referring to the amount of coding that's done by AI. \"But the big thing I think will come with agentic coding, which no one's doing for real yet.\"                When asked what was holding it back, Altman said: \"Oh, we just need a little longer,\" adding that it was a model problem, not a product issue.               For students preparing for careers, Altman advised cultivating \"resilience and adaptability\" and the \"meta ability to learn\" over learning specific things.               \"Whatever specific thing you're going to learn, like learn these general skills that seem like they're going to be important as the world goes through this transition,\" he said.               While software engineers are still in demand, Altman predicted that won't always be the case.               \"My basic assumption is that each software engineer will just do much, much more for a while. And then at some point, yeah, maybe we do need less software engineers,\" he said, referring to OpenAI's hiring strategy.               He also predicted that AI-driven job displacement won't happen all at once but will accelerate over time.               \"It kind of just seeps through the economy and mostly kind of like eats things little by little and then faster and faster,\" Altman said.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Business Insider Edition  Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made a quick pitch for Elon Musk's Tesla during a television interview on Wednesday.          \"I think if you want to learn something on this show tonight, buy Tesla. It's unbelievable that this guy's stock is this cheap. It'll never be this cheap again,\" Lutnick said in an interview on Fox News' \"Jesse Watters Primetime.\"               \"When people understand the things he's building, the robots he's building, the technology he's building. People are going to be dreaming of today, and Jesse Watters, and thinking, 'Gosh, I should have bought Elon Musk's stock,'\" Lutnick added.               Musk initially backed Lutnick as President Donald Trump's treasury secretary pick. Musk wrote in an X post in November that Lutnick \"will actually enact change\" instead of Trump's eventual choice, Scott Bessent, whom Musk called the \"business-as-usual\" option.               Before entering government, Lutnick was the chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald. The brokerage and investment bank, per an SEC filing in February, owns Tesla shares. Lutnick agreed to divest his business interests in the bank following his confirmation as commerce secretary.               Tesla's stock price has fallen by over 50% from its record highs. The company's shares closed at about $235 on Wednesday, down from a peak closing price of $479 in mid-December.               The decline in Tesla stock comes as the company grapples with weakening sales and the controversy surrounding Musk's work with the White House DOGE office. Scores of Musk protesters have descended upon Tesla showrooms nationwide in recent weeks.               \"So you're calling the bottom? This is it?\" Watters asked Lutnick about Tesla's stock on Wednesday.               \"If today's the bottom or not, I can tell you what \u2014 Elon Musk is probably the best person to bet on,\" Lutnick said.               Tesla and the Commerce Department did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.               Lutnick isn't the only government official who has voiced his support for Musk and Tesla.               Trump recently held a media event at the White House where he purchased a Model S. Multiple Tesla vehicles were parked on the south lawn of the White House during the event on March 11.               Trump wrote in a Truth Social post ahead of the event that his purchase was a \"show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.\"               On Tuesday, Musk blamed the political left for the protests and vandalism at Tesla dealerships.               \"It's really come as quite a shock to me that there is this level of, really, hatred and violence from the left,\" Musk told Fox News' \"Hannity\" on Tuesday.               \"Tesla is a peaceful company. We have never done anything harmful. I have never done anything harmful, only done productive things,\" Musk said.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Those hoping to finally see Nvidia\u2019s lower-end graphics cards in-person\u2014or at least see a pretty picture next to the dreaded words \u201cout of stock\u201d\u2014may need to wait several weeks more. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti may not be around this month, as previously expected. The rumor points to further delays from a tech world feeling the impacts of\u2026 let\u2019s just call it \u201cgeopolitical concerns.\u201d According to forum posts first reported by Videocardz, we may not see the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti until the middle of April at the earliest. The word comes from a post on Board Channels\u2014a forum that encompasses members with connections to the various graphics cards makers\u2014Nvidia has told all its partner graphics card makers that the 5060 and 5060 Ti were being delayed for one to two months. The message posted to the forum noted that the RTX 5060 Ti at either 16 GB or 8 GB of VRAM will be pushed to mid-April. The cheaper RTX 5060 may not be around until mid-May. Initial rumors supported a March release, but now Nvidia is reportedly telling its add-in card (AIC) partners that it will give them specific timing at a later date. These are relatively loose rumors, but the fact that Nvidia did not offer a peep about its lower-end graphics cards at its GTC 2025 conference supports the RTX 5060 timing for April at the earliest. It means we still don\u2019t have an idea about price, but you could bide your time looking at supposed leaked specs. Nvidia is still dealing with overwhelming stock woes that have limited access to the company\u2019s new Blackwell series, including the RTX 5090, RTX 5080, the RTX 5070 Ti and lower-end RTX 5070. This week, Nvidia cut some prices for the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 in Europe only. In the U.S., some cards are selling for $100 to $200 above manufacturer suggested price, or MSRP. Nvidia\u2019s best remedy so far has been what amounts to a raffle called \u201cpriority access.\u201d This can help beat the scalpers by limiting stock to verified members of the official Nvidia forums. It still doesn\u2019t help the vast majority of customers who want a card get their hands on one. AMD, with its recent Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT, has similarly faced issues with low stocks and inflated prices. AIC maker Yeston told customers on Tuesday that Radeon stocks would stabilize \u201cafter April.\u201d Nvidia joins the laundry list of companies holding back their big budget releases this week alone. Google dropped the first details of its new mid-range phone, the Pixel 9a, only to pull everything and delay its release citing a \u201ccomponent quality issue.\u201d On Thursday, Nothing, the makers of the upcoming Nothing 3a Pro, reportedly delayed preorders for its upcoming top-end smartphone. Android Police first reported on emails sent to customers noting that \u201cdue to demand, there will be a delay\u201d and orders are now set to ship April 15. There\u2019s nothing official to say any of these delays are due to\u2014or exacerbated by\u2014the ongoing Trump tariffs on imports from China. But we\u2019ve heard directly from companies how complicated their supply chains have become, just due to President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders. Companies would be better off telling customers how it is, but big tech likely does not want to run afoul of the vindictive grievance machine that currently occupies the White House.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"The Tesla Takedown movement is rallying against Elon Musk, and it\u2019s only getting bigger. by  Nilay Patel The Tesla Takedown movement is rallying against Elon Musk, and it\u2019s only getting bigger. by  Nilay Patel Today we\u2019re talking about the protests against Tesla, which have been branded on social media under the hashtag Tesla Takedown. The protests are, of course, a reaction to Elon Musk, who has managed to install himself as basically a not-so-shadow president who is tearing the federal government apart, leaving confusion and destruction in his wake.  A lot of people are deeply unhappy with this state of affairs. And because Musk is not an elected official but is, on some level, a car salesman, many of those frustrated and angry people are taking aim at the most visible and accessible symbol of his power and wealth: Tesla itself. There are protests at Tesla showrooms and charging stations every weekend now, and they\u2019re only getting bigger \u2014 and attracting police presence and threats of prosecution from the government. President Donald Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi have said that any violence aimed at Tesla vehicles or property would be prosecuted as domestic terrorism. This is very Trump, in that there is not actually a specific federal domestic terrorism law, but you know\u2026 Trump. In any case, these protests seem like they\u2019re working; Tesla\u2019s stock price has been sinking, new car registrations are down, and merely owning one has become uncomfortably political for a lot of people. We\u2019re also seeing the hype around the company fading in ways that are frankly surprising \u2014 popular YouTubers are pointing out that vehicles like the Cybertruck simply aren\u2019t very good and that Tesla\u2019s missed ship dates and big claims about the capabilities of its self-driving tech don\u2019t really hold up. And if the hype fades enough, it\u2019s possible to break Tesla itself \u2014 it\u2019s sky-high stock price is entirely based on hype, after all. To help pull this all apart, I asked Ed Niedermeyer to join me on the show. Niedermeyer published a book about Tesla in 2019 called Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors, and he hosts a podcast called Autonocast, about autonomous vehicle technology. His sizable following on Bluesky has also made him one of the leading organizers of the Tesla protests in Portland, Oregon, where he lives. So I wanted to bring him on the show to talk me through what he sees with both the big picture of Tesla as a company and on the ground with the ongoing protest movement. There\u2019s a lot happening and the story is changing fast, even since Niedermeyer and I talked at the beginning of the week. But that bigger picture \u2014 the disconnect between what he calls the \u201cmyth\u201d of Tesla and the reality, and how that reality is now manifesting into a global protest movement \u2014 is shaping up to be the defining story of Tesla\u2019s next chapter.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"President Donald Trump's frequently-changing tariff plans have introduced stock market volatility. This volatility, along with increased prices due to tariffs, have spurred fears that a recession could be around the corner. We aren't in a recession yet. But if you're planning on getting a sizable tax refund and you want to start preparing for one, here are three things you can do to make your refund count. The Federal Reserve recently chose to keep interest rates steady at the March Fed meeting. Since interest rates are high right now, that means that annual percentage rates for consumer loans are also high. This is especially true of credit cards, which offer a variable interest rate. \"What you once thought your interest rate was for your credit card has probably drastically increased without you even knowing, because all credit cards are variable interest rates,\" says Rianka R. Dorsainvil, CFP\u00ae professional, founder, and senior wealth advisor at YGC Wealth. If you have credit card debt you haven't paid yet, using the refund from your tax return to pay it off can be a great way to avoid racking up debt. But other loans with lower rates or fixed payment plans aren't as important to pay off right now. \"You want to focus on the high APR stuff,\" says Malik S. Lee, CFP\u00ae professional, managing principal for Felton and Peel Wealth Management. Unemployment rates are sitting around 4% right now, although it did rise slightly in February. While that rate isn't terrible, many job markets are being hit hard by layoffs \u2014 especially if you're a federal worker. If you have a job with the government, or you're in a role that's currently seeing a lot of layoffs, you might want to make sure your emergency fund is strong. \"Right now, cash is queen,\" says Dorsavinil. \"We need as much cash as possible because we are in an uncertain period of time.\" Both Lee and Dorsainvil say that high-yield savings accounts are a good place to put your tax refund if you're hoping to build your emergency fund. \"There are still some of these high-yield savings accounts paying 4.5%. That is higher than inflation's at right now,\" says Lee. Dorsainvil says you should try to maintain around three to six months of fixed living expenses in your emergency fund as a double-income household and around six to nine months if you have a single-income household. If your tax refund is less than $5,000, the Varo Savings Account could be a good place to store it. The Varo Savings Account offers 2.50% to 5.00% APY, with the highest interest rate being reserved for balances under $5,000. This makes it one of the few remaining 5% interest savings accounts. Since the average tax refund was around $3,000 last year and is around $3,300 this year according to a March 7 report from the IRS, it's likely your tax refund will be in a good spot to earn the highest interest rate from Varo. If you're looking for an account to store your general emergency fund in, or if you expect to get a tax refund of more than $5,000, here's a list of some of high-yield accounts from online banks. If you feel confident in your emergency fund and you don't have any high-interest debt you need to pay off, you might want to consider investing, whether through a brokerage account or other investing methods, while stock prices aren't at their highest point. Lee says, \"the S&P 500 is in the negative, and certain things are in correction territory, meaning down 10% from the highs. So, you may use this as a buying opportunity to buy some things that have pulled back from the highs.\" Just keep in mind that, unlike a federally insured bank account, there's a chance you'll lose the money you invest. \"Right now, the market is in flux,\" says Dorsainvil. \"So, if you put $10,000 in today, and tomorrow, it's $8,000, how would you feel? And if you're saying, 'I can't afford to lose that money,' then the market is not the place for your money right now.\" Get up to $1,000 in stock when you fund a new account. $0 ($1 to start investing); $5 fractional shares; $2,000 for margin trading 0% for active trading and automated investing  Get up to $1,000 in stock when you fund a new account.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Bivens is the chief economist at the Economic Policy Institute. His areas of research include macroeconomics, inequality, social insurance, public investment, and the economics of globalization. Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on March 05, 2025, in New York City. Bivens is the chief economist at the Economic Policy Institute. His areas of research include macroeconomics, inequality, social insurance, public investment, and the economics of globalization. The U.S. economy is often compared to a cruise ship\u2014it takes a lot of time and force to change its direction. This is why so many economists looked at the strong economy that was inherited by the Trump Administration and projected fast growth, low unemployment, declining inflation, and healthy stock market appreciation continuing for the next couple of years. But President Donald Trump\u2019s impact on the economy so far has been less a matter of turning the ship\u2019s rudder and more similar to a ship firing torpedoes at itself. Advertisement Advertisement The reversal in economic data since the Trump Administration took over has been historically rapid\u2014and bad. The stock market is in near free fall. Interest rates are also falling, but for an undesirable reason: investors are assuming the Federal Reserve will need to swoop in soon to try to aggressively rescue a falling economy with future interest rate cuts. Unemployment insurance claims for federal workers have noticeably jumped even before the full force of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) layoffs have been recorded.  Of course, economic data is reported retrospectively. But \u201cnowcasts,\u201d short-term predictions which allow us to estimate the current and future states of the economy, indicate that growth in gross domestic product for the first quarter of 2025 is collapsing, with some prominent projections showing outright economic contraction. Of note: A recession is often defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction. Plus, measures of economic policy uncertainty are rivaling, or exceeding, what prevailed during the worst phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.  None of these negative economic consequences were necessary, or even easy to make happen. It required a series of significant economic policy mistakes to make this scenario come to pass.  Much of the commentary around this stunning reversal of economic fortune focuses on Trump\u2019s tariff proposals. It is true that Trump\u2019s trade policy has involved chaotic shifts which threaten to destabilize the U.S. economy. But focusing only on his tariff policy misses other key policies that have been similarly damaging. Rather, the high-profile whipsaws on tariff policy have mostly made people realize that the misguided economic ideas championed during Trump\u2019s presidential campaign really might come to pass.  Take the potentially illegal actions of Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE. While the precise impact of DOGE\u2019s cuts to the federal workforce is hard to predict, the plan to destroy the capacity of the federal government by any means possible was stated plain as day during Trump\u2019s campaign. Russell Vought, now director at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), was a chief architect of Project 2025, and in this role said: \u201cWe want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected\u2026 We want their funding to be shut down.\u201d  Now it is clear that large-scale federal layoffs will likely have a short-run drag on economic growth. But even worse, the valuable services provided by federal agencies\u2014which are often a needed input and infrastructure for private-sector activity\u2014will wither and this degraded capacity will drag on growth for years to come. One key piece of evidence on how valuable these services are: When employees leave the federal government for the private sector, they tend to work fewer hours and earn significantly more in their new private-sector jobs. Trump\u2019s claim that many fired government employees \u201cdon\u2019t work at all\u201d is quantifiably false. The federal workforce is an absolute bargain in terms of value provided, and there\u2019s nothing \u201cefficient\u201d about arbitrarily gutting it.\u00a0 The Trump Administration\u2019s desire to enact mass deportations has yet to come to pass at scale. If it does, it is widely recognized that it would constitute a blow to the supply-side of the U.S. economy, depriving large swathes of U.S. business the labor force they rely on to produce goods and services. Mass deportations would cause enormous price spikes in the food and construction sectors. At least part of the recent softening of economic data surely represents business leaders starting to take these deportation threats literally and seriously.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s policy choices are also stifling investment in the economy, even among wealthy Americans\u2014and for good reason. The policy landscape in front of business leaders who make investment decisions is tumultuous. Empirical measures of economic policy uncertainty are on par with what was seen during the global COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, that moment in history can help us quantify how significantly Trump is negatively impacting the current economy.\u00a0 During Trump\u2019s first term, the economy performed decently. Though some may say his economic success from this term was also largely inherited, GDP grew and unemployment remained low. However, the economic success of Trump\u2019s first term abruptly ended after three years because of a pandemic that rocked the global economy.\u00a0 But this time around, the second Trump Administration has ended a strong inherited trend of economic growth in just two months with a string of policy decisions so bad that might match the destructiveness of a once-in-a-century pandemic in the minds of consumers and business owners.  This outlook and uncertainty are why economic indicators have begun warning of an imminent growth collapse, as Trump proposed policies look set to deliver sharp negative shocks to both the demand (Medicaid cuts and federal layoffs) and supply-side (deportations and tariffs) of the economy. For instance, cutting Medicaid benefits would mean consumers would either forego needed health care or would have to give up some other purchases to keep receiving the same amount of care. And on the supply-side, tariffs push up costs for domestic consumers by design while deportations reduce available labor supply.  Absent a complete series of policy reversals, economists such as myself predict unfortunate consequences for the U.S. economy. Layoffs of federal employees and contractors are already causing spillover effects in the private-sector as well as among contractors and small businesses. The federal cutbacks will hit the D.C. area hardest, but almost 80% of federal workers do not work in the D.C. metro area\u2014they are spread over every state and congressional district in the country. As a result, unemployment rates will likely rise over the coming months. The stock market declines may also lead to cutbacks in consumer spending. Plus, the trade war could stunt export growth and raise prices for consumers. Potential Medicaid cuts could also force closures of rural hospitals and squash spending on other goods and services as recipients have to dig deeper into their own pockets to buy needed health care. Deportations will likely lead to spiking prices for food and housing.  In short, the Trump Administration has started down a path of determined de-growth for the U.S. economy. There is still time to avoid a deeply damaging period of economic distress\u2014but it needs to happen soon. \u00a9 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"As many people know, chatbots have a proclivity for lying. They are perhaps one of the worst use cases for AI, trained to produce sentences that sound authoritative but could be presenting completely fabricated information; models are biased towards providing an answer even when they are not confident. Now, researchers at OpenAI say that supervising and disciplining chatbots only makes the problem worse, as the chatbots will put in more effort to hide their behavior. In a blog post regarding the work, OpenAI researchers describe using its GPT-4o model to \u201csupervise\u201d another of its large language models, disciplining it when it tried to lie. But that did not work, as the model would still lie, \u201conly now its cheating is undetectable by the monitor because it has learned to hide its intent in the chain-of-thought.\u201d Newer \u201cthinking\u201d models use multi-step reasoning to answer queries. If a user asks for an estimate on how much Americans spend on pet food each year, for instance, these models will break down the query into multiple steps\u2014how many dogs are in America, how much does it cost to feed the average dog, and so on and so forth. These models also often disclose their logic, or \u201cchain-of-thought,\u201d to the user so they can see how it came to its answer. Funnily enough, they will regularly cop to making up facts and details. In the \u201cpre-training\u201d step, when companies like OpenAI initially teach a model what types of answers they should produce, the models seem to be learning that it is easier to earn the cookie by taking shortcuts. Think of the runner in a marathon who hops in a car and skips most of the race. Users on social media have demonstrated Anthropic\u2019s Claude, when asked to conduct a data analysis from various research papers, will admit that it sometimes inserts filler data instead of actually looking through all the papers. OpenAI\u2019s researchers highlighted an instance in their testing in which the model, asked to write some tests to ensure a piece of code worked, surreptitiously decided to write some bad tests and then intentionally skip over them so the code would ultimately \u201cpass.\u201d With GPT-4o as a supervisor, the model would do this but not disclose it. almost lost $100 million because @AnthropicAI's Claude snuck in 'generate random data' as a fallback into my market maker code without telling me pic.twitter.com\/J3MLgsl5Lq \u2014 Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) March 5, 2025  AI companies have been trying to resolve the pernicious issue of models lying or \u201challucinating,\u201d as it is called in the field, and finally reach AGI, or the point where AI could surpass human ability. But OpenAI\u2019s researchers are essentially saying that after tens of billions of investments, they still do not know how to control the models to behave appropriately. \u201cIf strong supervision is directly applied to the chain-of-thought, models can learn to hide their intent while continuing to misbehave,\u201d they added. For now, companies should not implement supervision of models which seems like not exactly a great solution. Ergo, let them keep lying for now or else they will just gaslight you. tfw claude code spent 739 seconds \"manifesting,\" failed to make the change you asked for, broke 3 other things that used to work fine, and then charged you $11.14 pic.twitter.com\/Ap2JLQ0uI8 \u2014 adam \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@personofswag) March 19, 2025  The research should serve as a reminder to be careful when relying on chatbots, especially when it comes to critical work. They are optimized for producing a\u00a0confident-looking\u00a0answer but do not care much about factual accuracy. \u201cAs we\u2019ve trained more capable frontier reasoning models, we\u2019ve found that they have become increasingly adept at exploiting flaws in their tasks and misspecifications in their reward functions, resulting in models that can perform complex reward hacks in coding tasks,\u201d the OpenAI researchers concluded. Several reports have suggested that most enterprises have yet to find value in all the new AI products coming onto the market, with tools like Microsoft Copilot and Apple Intelligence beset with problems, as scathing reviews detail their poor accuracy and lack of real utility. According to a recent report from Boston Consulting Group, a survey of 1,000 senior executives across 10 major industries found that 74% showed any tangible value from AI. What makes it all the more galling is that these \u201cthinking\u201d models are slow, and quite a bit more expensive than smaller models. Do companies want to pay $5 for a query that will come back with made-up information? Then again, humans are fallible too, but complacency surrounding AI\u2019s answers creates an entirely new problem. There is always a lot of hype in the tech industry for things then you step out of it and realize most people still are not using it. For now, it is not worth the hassle, and credible sources of information are more important than ever as big tech companies push chatbots onto their users. AI models in closed-loop platforms risk collapsing the open internet where reliable information has thrived.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Business Insider Edition  Tesla's most bullish Wall Street analyst said Elon Musk's company is in a \"crisis,\" and only its CEO can fix it.          Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, who has consistently been optimistic about Tesla's long-term outlook, wrote in a joint note on Wednesday that the EV maker is facing a \"defining chapter\" in its trajectory, and the outcome will depend on Musk.               \"Lets call it like it is: Tesla is going through a crisis and there is one person who can fix it....Musk,\" Ives wrote in his memo.               For nearly nine weeks, Tesla has been on a historic decline, with its stock sitting 53% below its all-time high from mid-December. The company is battered by increasing competition in China, sagging global vehicle sales, and a reputation problem that investors worry is being caused by a distracted CEO.               \"If you agree or disagree with DOGE it misses the point that by Musk spending 110% of his time with DOGE (and not as Tesla CEO) since President Trump got back into the White House this has essentially turned Tesla into a political symbol....and this is a bad thing,\" Ives wrote on Wednesday.               Ives added in his note that Tesla is at a crossroads and Musk needs to do two things if he wants to \"end this crisis and make sure it does not snowball into a much more black swan event for the Tesla brand over the coming years.\"               Firstly, Ives said that Musk needs to make a statement, either before or during Tesla's first quarterly earnings call in early May, on how he will manage his roles at Tesla and the White House DOGE office.               \"Investors need to see Musk take a step back and balance his DOGE and Tesla CEO roles,\" Ives said.               If Musk does take a step back, the \"heat\" around his DOGE work will \"start to dissipate,\" Ives said. That \"will leave a scar for Tesla\" but won't amount to \"permanent brand damage,\" Ives added.               Secondly, Ives said that Musk must provide a \"roadmap and timing for the new lower cost vehicles\" Tesla is releasing this year, and more guidance on the \"unsupervised FSD roll-out in Austin in June.\"               Ives added that investors need to hear from Musk, particularly given \"the Model Y refresh, inventory issues, and a host of demand issues with Musk brand damage a worry.\"               Tesla and Ives did not respond to requests for comment from BI.               Musk pitched his idea of a government efficiency commission to President Donald Trump during a livestream on X in August, and said he would be \"happy to help out\" with slashing federal spending.               To be sure, Musk's relationship with Trump was initially viewed as a positive development for his businesses.               Musk's net worth grew by up as much as $224 billion following Trump's election victory in November, per Bloomberg's estimates. But his net worth has since fallen by around $122 billion this year mainly due to a decline in Tesla's stock prices.               In mid-December, Tesla shares reached a peak closing price of $479. The company's shares closed at about $235 on Wednesday.               Some investors are less concerned than Ives.               Tsai Capital's president and chief investment officer, Christopher Tsai, told Business Insider this week that it is important to distinguish between Musk's work with DOGE, and his involvement with the US government.               \"Elon being involved in the government is allowing him to shape policy,\" Tsai said, adding that the \"negative market sentiment\" over Musk and DOGE will \"disappear at some point.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

Translated from Korean to English, contains this paragraph: > XR is a concept that encompasses virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). It is a technology that uses various senses such as vision, hearing, and movement to help users experience new experiences across the surrounding reality and virtual worlds. Meta, Apple, etc., launched a dedicated device, and the XR wind blew. Lg is a highly diversified toothpaste company actually LOL! thanks for that CDR: https:\/\/lgcorp.com\/about\/ci\/st... [lgcorp.com] wtf does xr mean? ...are great research projectsBut, they are long term research projects with no guarantee of successThe problem is hard, really, really hard and even those who believe it's hard will be surprised as they discover new reasons why it's hard To be fair, just as much contempt LG has for the market they were serving. The fact that no one here on Slashdot knows (save for a few VR fanbois) is shows not so much a failure for Slashdot, but a failure for LG. I'm a big fan of all this stuff, and geeky early adopter.

This is what VR has been missing all along! The name wasn't EXTREME enough! Reality isn't real until it's XXXXXXXXTREME! Would have been cool if the summary or article had pointed out what XR was and I didn't have to go hunting to figure it out.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? When it comes to wireless audio, Sonos is a brand that has reigned supreme in the AV space for many years. The company makes everything from powered Wi-Fi speakers to Dolby Atmos soundbars and pulse-pounding subwoofers. Sonos also makes smaller soundbars, including the Sonos Ray, which\u00a0just so happens to be on sale this week:\u00a0 Right now, when you purchase the Sonos Ray Soundbar at Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart, and several other retailers, you\u2019ll only pay $180. The full MSRP on this bar is $280. We tested the Sonos Ray back in April 2023, and reviewer Simon Cohen said, \u201cSonos sets the stage for a much more affordable home theater system with the Ray.\u201d    One of the biggest complaints we hear about TV speakers is how crummy they can be when it comes to dialogue and vocals. That\u2019s precisely what soundbars like the Sonos Ray are designed to do: enhance audio basics while providing a boatload of extra features for fun! The Ray delivers exceptional dialogue clarity, ensuring you won\u2019t miss another important line on your favorite show. While the bar struggles to reproduce deeper bass frequencies, you can always invest in a Sonos subwoofer down the line for additional low end. Thanks to the Ray\u2019s digital optical port, you\u2019ll be able to play back audio formats like Dolby Digital and DTS. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no HDMI eARC to speak of, so Atmos virtualization is out of the question. Still, iOS users will be able to use the Sonos app to calibrate audio output to best match the room acoustics you\u2019re working with. The app is also your go-to command center for Sonos speaker grouping, music streaming, and more.\u00a0 Other noteworthy features include Apple AirPlay, Spotify Connect, and Tidal Connect support. We wish we knew how long this Sonos sale was going to last, as there are actually a ton of Sonos devices with discounts right now. Save $100 when you order the Sonos Ray today, and give your TV speakers the upgrade they deserve.\u00a0 And if you want even more audio suggestions, we suggest looking through our roundups of the best Sonos deals, best soundbar deals, and best Bluetooth speaker deals, too.    We love it when there\u2019s a great TV promo on a holdover from a previous year\u2019s lineup, especially when it\u2019s from a brand like Sony. We\u2019re alluding to the incredible Sony Bravia XR X90L 4K LED, an excellent midrange set that brings great picture quality and a host of smart features to the table. And for a limited time, when you purchase the Sony 65-inch X90L at Best Buy, Amazon, Crutchfield, and a handful of other retailers, you\u2019ll only pay $950. That $250 you just saved could quickly go toward one of the best soundbar deals of the week (it\u2019s just a suggestion). We also tested the X90L not too long ago and editor at large Caleb Denison said, \u201cThe Sony X90L is a surprising treat of a TV.\u201d It\u2019s Sonos sales week! (That\u2019s the unofficial name we\u2019re sticking with.) Sonos\u2019 wireless speakers, soundbars, subwoofers, and a few other devices are discounted this week, including the Sonos Beam (Gen 2). For as long as this sale lasts, you\u2019ll be able to purchase the latest version of the Beam for only $400. That\u2019s a $100 discount off the soundbar\u2019s MSRP. When we tested the Beam (Gen 2) a couple of years back, resident AV expert Simon Cohen said, \u201cDolby Atmos adds a splash of 3D fun to an already excellent soundbar.\u201d When it comes to budget-friendly TVs, LED-LCDs and QLED sets tend to make up the vast majority of what\u2019s available. But what if we told you that you could own a fantastic OLED TV for the price of an entry-level QLED? It\u2019s true, and the set we\u2019re referring to is the Sansui S55VOUG, a 55-inch OLED that just happens to be on sale this week.\u00a0 For a limited time, you\u2019ll be able to purchase the Sansui S55VOUG 4K OLED TV at Micro Center and pay only $650! This OLED is usually $1,000, so that's a substantial $350 discount.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Apple\u2019s computer lineup has greatly benefitted from its update to the M4 chip in 2024. The brand introduced the M4 MacBook Pro and iMac lines in the last year\u2013 and research has further indicated that Apple\u2019s decision to shift from Intel processors to proprietary silicon was a solid move. It has made consumers favor Apple laptops more.\u00a0 According to statistics from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP), MacBook form factors, in either MacBook Pro or MacBook Air made up 86% of Apple\u2019s PC market share in 2024. Consumers especially favored the M4 MacBook Pro at a rate of 53%, while 33% of MacBook Air models shipped during the year, and 14% of iMac models. These figures vary only slightly from the year prior; however, CIRP noted that Apple appears to have weathered any fluctuations that may have occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 Additionally, the MacBook Pro has had consistently higher shipments among the M-series devices between 2020 and 2024 but only inched above 50% shipments in 2023.\u00a0\u00a0 After introducing the M-series chip in 2020, the reception to its changes has been largely strong, with boosts to performance and battery efficiency being among the top accolades of the specifications revamp, Apple Insider noted.\u00a0 Between the different models in the Mac lines, consumers have come to especially favor the MacBook Pro lineup due to the high-performance similarity to the iMac, as well as the portability aspect of the laptop form factor. The higher-price tier of the Pro line has not been a deterrent for consumers purchasing this model. Especially as sales and discounts become more prevalent with more time spent on the market, Wccftech noted.\u00a0 The M4 MacBook Pro launched in October 2024, but now its 14-inch model is discounted on Amazon by $200, selling for $1,400, the publication added.\u00a0 The M4 MacBook Air was introduced in early 2025, and while Apple claims it is the most powerful MacBook Air ever released, there are no shipment figures for the laptop. So, it remains to be seen how consumers will receive the device. However, reviews for the device have been positive.\u00a0  If you were looking to save money on an iPad Pro with an OLED display, you can go ahead and invest in the M4 iPad Pro because the M5 iPad Pro might not have any new features to set it apart from its predecessor. Details from the research firm, Meritz Securities suggest that upgrades for the upcoming professional-tier iPad may primarily come down to the M5 chip, with Apple expected to save bigger feature overhauls for subsequent generations of the tablet series. Apple is marching in with new products for the spring, including a new MacBook Air featuring the M4 chip, a new iPad Air, uniquely featuring the M3 chip, and a new Mac Studio desktop, with M4 Max and M3 Ultra chip options. While enthusiasts await the launch of the coveted M5 chip series devices, including the MacBook Pro and iPad Pro later this year\u2013 the tech brand has brought in the expected refresh of its early-year devices. Notably, the MacBook Air and iPad Air see yearly upgrades, while the Mac Studio is getting its first revamp since 2023. While largely maintaining their external designs, most changes to the devices can be found by way of hardware and AI support upgrades. Apple is looking to showcase Apple Intelligence app integration as functional and accessible to users. The brand is competing on the market with many on-device AI experiences, such as Microsoft\u2019s Copilot+ PCs and Chromebooks inundated with Google Gemini.\u00a0 Last week, Apple revealed a new Mac Studio equipped with M4 Max and M3 Ultra chips. No, that\u2019s not a typo -- the company really did launch a new Mac with chips from two different generations, where the less powerful chip is from the newer iteration. As I\u2019ve written before, it\u2019s a confusing, ridiculous situation, and one that must be driving Apple\u2019s marketing division mad. But at first, it seemed like there was a glimmer of reasoning behind the decision: Apple could save the rumored M4 Ultra chip for the Mac Pro and bring back some proper differentiation to the Mac lineup. Instead of having the Mac Studio and the Mac Pro offer the same maximum performance (as we have now), the Mac Pro would finally get a sizeable boost to tempt power-hungry pro users. \r Please enable Javascript to view this content  Upgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Business Insider Edition  Even as some luxury automakers like Bentley and Mercedes-Benz face sales slumps, Lamborghini has seen explosive growth and is working to target a key new demographic, its CEO told Business Insider.           The Audi-owned brand had a banner year in 2024, with $910 million (835 million euros) in profits, up 15.5% over the previous year, on a record-high revenue of $3.4 billion (3.09 billion euros)               CEO Stephan Winkelmann attributes much of that success to investments in hybrid tech and the revamp of its entire lineup over the past 18 months.               \"We have all plug-in hybrids at Lamborghini, all three cars, and this is something which is paramount to the success of the brand,\" he said in an interview with Business Insider.               But with the luxury auto market struggling, how much more can the Italian supercar maker grow, and where will it find its next generation of customers?               Lamborghini sold a record-high 10,687 cars worldwide last year, more than triple the number it sold in 2015.            Despite those successes, Winkelmann is quick to offer a reminder that there's plenty of room to grow as Lamborghini's sales are but a drop in the bucket compared to the 80 million cars sold worldwide yearly.               \"In certain cities in the world we have a higher density of our cars. On the other hand, we have more and more high net-worth individuals worldwide, so there is an opportunity to increase volumes without losing exclusivity,\" Winkelmann said.               The company's recent successes have been driven by the popularity of its Urus SUV and the discontinued Huracan supercar, which will be replaced this year by the new Temerario. Last year, these two models accounted for 87% of the brand's sales.               According to Winkelmann, further growth from the brand's current three-model lineup, topped by its flagship Revulto supercar, will be incremental rather than the massive leaps it made in recent years.               \"We're not looking for doubling the volumes from 10,000 to 20,000. This is not the next big step we want to have,\" the Lamborghini CEO explained.               Instead, the company believes its next surge in sales will come from an upcoming fourth model in its lineup, expected to be a 1,300 horsepower EV called the Lanzador in 2029.               \"We need to have car number four for additional growth because this car will be in a different sub-segment than the ones we are in today. So it's an add-on and not something that will cannibalize sales from the ones we have today,\" Winkelmann said.               The average Lamborghini customer is in their mid-40s, owns 12 cars, and makes their living in every line of work imaginable. They're overwhelmingly male.                Women make up just 5% to 6% of the brand's current customer base, but they may be a rich vein of prospective Lamborghini buyers for the company to tap into.               And some markets have already found success in doing so.               \"I was in Korea last week and they are already at a 50% share of women,\" Winkelmann said. \" So it's the beginning of the right path.\"               Geographically, the US is Lamborghini's largest and most important market, followed by key markets in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East.               And the company expects this to remain the case moving forward.               \"There are no big surprises coming,\" Winkelmann said.               However, the Lamborghini CEO notes that India has long shown an untapped potential to be one of the brand's biggest markets.               \"I do not see any other market, except India, which has the promise to grow dramatically in terms of size like the [key markets I've mentioned],\" he said.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"It can be something more than just the \u2018next Game of Thrones\u2019 by  Leon Miller When Prime Video\u2019s The Wheel of Time debuted in late 2021, it was just one of many prestige TV shows flooding the market. Studios, networks, and tech companies alike were throwing a staggering amount of resources at their respective streaming platforms in an effort to stockpile glossy, must-see programming guaranteed to boost their subscriber numbers. Within this mad dash for streaming supremacy, a separate race was run: the scramble to score the next Game of Thrones-level fantasy blockbuster. A series so irresistible that everyone would tune in. As strategies go, it was pretty smart. The fantasy genre is full of popular preexisting IP that\u2019s arguably a safer bet than an untested original idea, and often comes with a ton of built-in spinoff potential to boot. It\u2019s also inherently splashy (lavish costumes, sets, and VFX scream \u201cpremium\u201d) and \u2014 if packaged just right \u2014 can even lure in folks who wouldn\u2019t otherwise fuck with snow zombies or dragons. In short? A fantasy show can do a lot for a platform\u2019s performance and perception, which is why so many of them backed the genre. HBO leveraged its existing rights agreements and greenlit a Thrones spinoff, House of the Dragon (after another, famously expensive false start). Netflix put its chips on Shadow and Bone, The Witcher, and The Sandman. Disney \u2014 primarily focused on its fantasy-tinged Star Wars property \u2014 still managed to crank out Willow and Percy Jackson and the Olympians. And Amazon went all in on The Wheel of Time and The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. But fast-forward to 2025, and the gold rush is over. Streaming platforms are shifting away from subscriber growth as the ultimate metric for success. The days of the blank-check prestige production are over (if they ever even existed). Hell, shows are getting axed before they even enter production: Disney and Hulu recently confirmed they\u2019re not moving forward with a Court of Thorns and Roses adaptation, despite those books being the fantasy IP right now. Which begs the question: What does all this mean for the state of fantasy TV, and the shows still standing? What becomes of a series like The Wheel of Time \u2014 currently on its third season \u2014 now that it\u2019s outlived the corporate game plan that helped get it greenlit? [Ed. note: This article contains spoilers for The Wheel of Time season 3, episode 4, and touches on some events that happen later on in the book series.]  When Amazon executive chairman Jeff Bezos was still CEO, he supposedly ordered then-Amazon Studios boss Roy Price to find him a crossover hit in the same vein as HBO\u2019s global phenomenon. This led to a lot of projects getting the thumbs up, including The Wheel of Time. But here\u2019s the thing: The Wheel of Time is not \u2014 and will never be \u2014 Game of Thrones. Sure, Robert Jordan\u2019s fantasy novels superficially have a lot in common with George R.R. Martin\u2019s A Song of Ice and Fire tomes (which served as the basis for Game of Thrones). Aside from their faux-medieval settings, both involve plenty of court intrigue and political wheeling and dealing. And unlike J.R.R. Tolkien\u2019s The Lord of the Rings and its associated works, they both acknowledge the sexual appetites of their respective casts. Yet there are also incredibly pronounced differences between these two fantasy sagas \u2014 so much so that showrunner Rafe Judkins felt the need to manage Amazon execs\u2019 expectations when they hired him. \u201cThis show and the books are not like Game of Thrones. I said that to Amazon right up front,\u201d Judkins recalled back in 2021. \u201cI was like, If you are looking for the next Game of Thrones, this isn\u2019t it. What I\u2019m gonna pitch you is a series that is really different.\u201d  He\u2019s not wrong, either. Take the sex stuff I mentioned earlier: Yes, Jordan\u2019s books reference characters getting it on \u2014 Jordan\u2019s series also has a wild subplot that lands somewhere between BDSM and outright rape \u2014 but it\u2019s all presented in relatively chaste, indirect terms. The word \u201csex\u201d (much less \u201cfuck\u201d) is never used, and unlike in Martin\u2019s works, the act itself typically happens between paragraphs. The Wheel of Time show follows suit \u2014 and, in some cases, actually tones down some of Jordan\u2019s more \u201cadult\u201d content. Not only is there none of the sibling-on-sibling doggy style or foreground blowjobs that characterize HBO\u2019s Westeros adaptations, even the non-sexualized nudity Jordan describes (for example, during Aes Sedai testing) is missing from the Prime Video version of The Wheel of Time. The Wheel of Time books are also a damn sight less \u201cTV ready\u201d than A Song of Ice and Fire. Don\u2019t get me wrong: Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss had their work cut out for them wrangling Martin\u2019s sprawling source material into a coherent, easy-to-digest series. The fact they completely overhauled the show\u2019s original, unaired pilot is a testament to just how tough it is to make sense of A Song of Ice and Fire\u2019s sheer volume of characters, locations, and lore. But compared to the challenge Judkins and his team faced with The Wheel of Time, Benioff and Weiss got off easy. They were whittling down five novels (plus a napkin\u2019s worth of bullet points), not 15 \u2014 and 15 subplot-heavy novels, at that.  It\u2019s a similar situation to the one The Rings of Power showrunners J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay currently find themselves in: So. Much. Material. Their assignment is crafting a cogent multi-season epic out of back matter paragraphs (at best) lifted from Tolkien\u2019s Lord of the Rings trilogy and its appendices. So, they\u2019ve got a bunch of heroes and villains and a pile of massive plot beats to hit \u2014 most of them separated by both an unwieldy in-universe timeline and sweeping geography \u2014 and no pre-baked narrative to hang any of it on. Oh, and everybody (including, presumably, Amazon) is expecting Peter Jackson\u2019s The Lord of the Rings movies, which are (for reasons the above should make fairly obvious) an entirely different beast. Fortunately for Judkins, he doesn\u2019t have to deal with those last two headaches; however, he\u2019s surely sympathetic to Payne and McKay\u2019s battle with the IP bulk. Still, everyone\u2019s got a different burden in the fantasy streaming revolution. And for Judkins, it\u2019s how Jordan\u2019s story requires so much establishment compared to other properties. You can communicate the setup for something as story-critical as Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s quest for the Iron Throne with just a few lines of dialogue explaining her exile. There\u2019s no need to get too deep in the weeds regarding Robert\u2019s Rebellion and the Targaryen dynasty\u2019s downfall. Equally, a super-brief prologue is all you need to get Galadriel, Halbrand Sauron, and the rest of the Middle-earth gang\u2019s Second Age adventures up and running, because (thanks to Jackson\u2019s trilogy) audiences are already familiar with their older, Third Age incarnations. But so many of The Wheel of Time\u2019s biggest payoffs fall flat without the necessary preamble. That\u2019s why season 2\u2019s climactic Heroes of the Horn moment is so underwhelming: because the show never properly explains who these guys and gals are, or why they matter before they flank Mat. Similarly, the true motivations (and origins) of the second season\u2019s Seanchan baddies are presumably frustratingly opaque to anyone who hasn\u2019t read Jordan\u2019s second Wheel of Time novel, The Great Hunt. Yet most of all, what separates The Wheel of Time \u2014 and every other gold rush fantasy series apart from House of the Dragon \u2014 from Game of Thrones is their differing approach to genre tropes. With A Song of Ice and Fire, Martin very consciously zigs where escapist fiction in general, and Tolkien\u2019s Middle-earth mythos in particular, would zag. By contrast, Jordan openly admitted to channeling (pardon the pun) The Lord of the Rings early on in The Wheel of Time, and it\u2019s apparent in everything from the idyllic, Shire-like Two Rivers to uncrowned king Lan. The upshot of this is that the moral polarity of Jordan\u2019s universe (like many fantasy universes) skews positive. His heroes are unequivocally heroic; even protagonist Rand \u2014 who spends most of The Wheel of Time teetering on the brink of madness \u2014 ultimately wants to do the right thing. And such nobility is typically rewarded, even if the occasional supporting character gives their life along the way. Meanwhile, A Song of Ice and Fire gleefully subverts this moral status quo. Storybook heroism gets you killed in Westeros, and gets less done than well-intentioned pragmatism anyway.  Neither of these approaches is right or wrong, but there\u2019s no denying that part of Game of Thrones\u2019 popularity was thanks to emulating Martin\u2019s anyone can die, everyone can lie credo. Yet this approach only works when wedded to the right IP. Indeed, some of The Wheel of Time\u2019s biggest bum notes come from aping Game of Thrones\u2019 borderline nihilism, resulting in an oddly gritty Two Rivers, a Mat Cauthon who murders an entire family, and a child-killing Queen Morgase. Were these incongruous elements Judkins\u2019 way of trying to reach the Thrones-enamored audience he knew Amazon expected him to lure in? If so, it didn\u2019t work, and was probably never going to work. And that\u2019s what it all boils down to, really: The Wheel of Time was never the right IP for Amazon. It\u2019s maybe not even the right IP for TV more broadly. On paper, it\u2019s a no-brainer: a bestselling saga with complex characters and a rich mythology. In practice, it\u2019s ill suited to easy adaptation \u2014 and that\u2019s without a subscriber-count arms race hanging over production. True, The Wheel of Time hasn\u2019t been a total bust for Amazon. Reviews for all three seasons are solid, and viewership stats are very healthy. It\u2019s not, however, the zeitgeist-shaping, Prime Video ubiquity-creating franchise Bezos supposedly demanded. But like I said at the top: That doesn\u2019t matter so much anymore, now that the fantasy streaming gold rush is done. And if shows like The Wheel of Time don\u2019t have to be something they\u2019re not \u2014 namely, Game of Thrones 2.0 \u2014 maybe now they can fully, truly be their best selves. They can let their freak flags fly (as The Rings of Power has increasingly done) and focus solely on capturing the spirit of their own source material in a different medium, without filtering it through someone else\u2019s. To date, that\u2019s something The Wheel of Time has only fitfully accomplished, and in almost every instance, it\u2019s done so by following its own playbook, not the post-Game of Thrones fantasy TV template. Consider season 1\u2019s most striking sequence: the final moments of Rand\u2019s pregnant mom, Tigraine, on a snowy battlefield in episode 7. This isn\u2019t a direct pull from Jordan\u2019s first Wheel of Time book, The Eye of the World, which only covers some of this information via dialogue, leaving the rest for later volumes. Yet presenting this as a flashback was absolutely the right call for the Wheel of Time show, as it communicates the truth about Rand\u2019s parentage (and identity as the Dragon Reborn) far more viscerally than slavishly following Jordan\u2019s prose \u2014 or Game of Thrones\u2019 flashback-skeptic sensibility \u2014 ever could have. Without spoiling things, there\u2019s another \u201cinvented\u201d flashback in season 3\u2019s finale that does a similarly impressive job of fleshing out the festering rivalry at the heart of Tar Valon\u2019s strife. It\u2019s something else Jordan didn\u2019t need to cover firsthand on the page that viewers do need to see on the screen. Rand\u2019s revelatory Rhuidean vision quest in season 3, episode 4 is a similar proposition. This event is in Jordan\u2019s books, but the way Judkins and director Thomas Napper stage it could only work on screen \u2014 and only in this specific story. They succinctly cover both the Aiel\u2019s secret history and Lanfear\u2019s origin story, while also adding (or emphasizing) visual and audio details \u2014 most notably, the Song of Growing ritual mentioned elsewhere in Jordan\u2019s writings \u2014 that heighten its sensory impact. The combined effect of Lanfear\u2019s sci-fi research lab floating in the sky, the chanting proto-Aiel in the fields below, and the existential, sky-crumbling horror that follows is genuinely haunting. More than that, it\u2019s something you couldn\u2019t manifest on the page, and is too flat-out strange to mimic in a show like Game of Thrones. Could more moments of undiluted Wheel of Time weirdness be on the horizon in future seasons? We can only hope. The same goes for the dizzying supercut of Moiraine\u2019s possible futures that runs in parallel with Rand\u2019s journey into the past: It\u2019s a major embellishment on the part of Judkins and Napper. Jordan left the alternate lives (and deaths) of Rosamund Pike\u2019s Aes Sedai in the margins; in contrast to the protracted, granular depiction of what Rand saw, we only get the general gist of Moiraine\u2019s ordeal in the books (and secondhand, at that). On the page, that plays \u2014 fostering a sense of mystery around a key supporting character\u2019s fate. But in a screen adaptation, it\u2019s practically a sin to leave something like this to viewers\u2019 imaginations. Judkins and Napper clearly get that, and the swirling 360-degree montage they deliver is a powerful illustration of what can happen when an adaptation uses its source material as a starting point, not a final destination. Not for nothing, in its sheer bravura dynamism, it also puts the more pedestrian prophetic visions in House of the Dragon\u2019s latest season to shame, too. More, please. Let\u2019s also keep our fingers crossed that there\u2019s less impetus (self-imposed or otherwise) for Judkins and co. to imitate the R-rated romance of The Wheel of Time\u2019s raunchier competitors. Admittedly, Judkins has maintained from the start that he wasn\u2019t interested in chasing the same risque thrills as Game of Thrones, The Witcher, A Court of Thorns and Roses, or their ilk. But I have to imagine that not falling too far short of viewers\u2019 expectations on this front is what resulted in The Wheel of Time\u2019s couples (and throuples) content shooting for an awkward middle ground between Jordan\u2019s sweet-natured suggestiveness and all-out orgies.  No, it hasn\u2019t stopped the rise of an online thirst brigade \u2014 and if anything, it\u2019s apparently the right amount of friction (pun fully intended this time) for more conservative viewers. But still: It\u2019s one of the more glaringly clunky aspects of the show that\u2019s easy to fix when matching other series\u2019 heat is less of a going concern. More than that, it\u2019d give the Wheel of Time team more room to elaborate further on something uniquely Jordanian: delightfully bonkers romantic dynamics. Yes, The Lord of the Rings\u2019 interspecies hookups have a star-crossed charm and Game of Thrones\u2019 and House of the Dragon\u2019s incest is queasily fascinating, but they\u2019re not a patch on the sublime unorthodoxy of many of The Wheel of Time\u2019s canonical pairings.  We\u2019re seeing some of this in season 3, with Rand and Lanfear\u2019s dreamscape tryst. This naughty affair doesn\u2019t just get decent mileage out of the \u201cbad girl\u201d trope \u2014 it also draws a substantial amount of juice from Lanfear being less in love with Rand than with his reincarnated soul. There\u2019s so much more material like this that future seasons could get into, from Lan and Nynaeve switching up stereotypical gender roles via Sea Folk role-play to the vaguely Gone Girl-esque scenario Mat ends up in. Let\u2019s also not forget the books\u2019 infamous quad only hinted at in the show so far. Why not lean hard into all of this stuff (and more besides)? After all, the time is ripe for it.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Listen to Theo read this article \"This has been our family car for three years, and it has been an absolute dream,\" says Ben Kilbey as he shows me his gleaming pearl-white Tesla Model Y. Ben is a staunch electric car advocate. He runs a communications firm that promotes sustainable businesses in the UK. Yet now, he says, the Model Y has to go \u2013 because he disapproves vehemently of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's actions, especially the way he has handled firing US government employees. \"I'm not a fan of polarisation, or of doing things without kindness,\" he says. \"There are ways of doing things that don't ostracise people or belittle them. I don't like belittlement.\" Ben is part of a wider backlash against the Tesla boss that appears to have been gathering momentum in recent weeks, since Musk was appointed head of the controversial Department for Government Efficiency (DOGE), charged with taking an axe to federal government spending. Musk has also intervened in politics abroad, making a video appearance at a rally for the far-right party Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland ahead of Germany's parliamentary election, as well as launching online attacks on British politicians, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer. For some who do not share his views, it has all become too much.  There have been protests outside dozens of Tesla dealerships, not only in the US, but also in Canada, the UK, Germany and Portugal.  Although most of them have been peaceful, there have been cases of showrooms, charging stations and vehicles being vandalised. In separate incidents in France and Germany, several cars were set on fire. In the US, the Tesla Cybertruck, an angular metallic pickup truck, appears to have become a particular magnet for anti-Musk sentiment. A number of social media videos have shown vehicles daubed with swastikas, covered with rubbish or used as skateboard ramps. US President Donald Trump was quick to show his support to Tesla, by allowing the company to show off its vehicles outside the White House, and pledging to buy one. He said violence against US showrooms should be treated as \"domestic terrorism\". Musk has also been unequivocal in his response. \"This level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\" he said in a recent interview with Fox News. \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\" What is hard to quantify is exactly how much impact all this has had on Tesla as a business - and the extent to which Musk's views and involvement in the Trump administration has affected the brand and alienated some traditional electric vehicle buyers.  And if that is the case, can Tesla really build on its past success with Musk remaining at the helm? Two decades ago, Tesla was a tiny Silicon Valley start-up, with a handful of employees and big dreams of revolutionising the motor industry. Today it is the best-selling producer of electric vehicles in a growing global market, with giant factories around the world. It is also widely credited with having proven that EVs could be fast, powerful, fun and practical. Musk, the figurehead of the company, has driven this all forward, since he joined Tesla in 2004 as its chairman and principal funder. He became chief executive four years later, and has held that role throughout the company's rise to prominence. \"Tesla was the pioneer,\" says Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at car sector marketing and software firm Cox Automotive. \"They kind of got EVs into the mainstream, got other manufacturers to start investing, and really created a lot of awareness.\" It is easy to forget that electric cars were once derided as slow, uninspiring and impractical, with minimal range between charges. The Tesla Model S, which went on sale in 2012, had sports car performance and a range of more than 250 miles. It played a key role in changing perceptions, and provided a springboard for rapid growth. Nowadays, Tesla is not just a producer of electric vehicles. It has invested heavily in autonomous driving systems, with the goal of building fleets of driverless \"robotaxis\". It also has a fast-growing energy-storage business, and is developing a general-purpose humanoid robot, known as Optimus. Like the late Steve Jobs at Apple, Musk became the embodiment of his brand, ever present as the front man at company events and product launches, with a devoted following among EV enthusiasts. But recently the champion of sustainable technology has become equally well known for promoting his political views, amplifying them through his own social network, X. At the same time, Tesla itself has been facing mounting challenges. Although its Model Y was the best-selling car worldwide last year, overall sales fell for the first time in more than a decade, dropping from 1.81 million to 1.79 million. The decline was relatively small, and Tesla retained its position as the world's best-selling maker of electric vehicles, but for a growth-focused business, it raised alarm bells. Profits for the year were also down. This year has also begun badly, notably in Europe, where there was a 45% fall in new registrations in January compared to the same month in 2024. There were further falls in major European markets in February \u2013 although the UK was an outlier, with sales rising 21% \u2013 as well as in Australia.  Meanwhile, shipments of Tesla's Chinese-made cars, which are produced for sale both in China and abroad, fell more than 49% in the same month. In early March, Joseph Spak, Wall Street analyst at Swiss bank UBS, published a research note in which he predicted a decline in Tesla's worldwide sales this year of 5%. That forecast, which countered market expectations of 10% growth, helped to send Tesla's share price tumbling. It fell 15% in a single day \u2013 adding to an overall decline of 40% since the start of the year. Sales can fall for many reasons, and people within Tesla have suggested that a drop in sales was to be expected as the company geared up for the launch of the new Model Y \u2013 with potential customers holding off for the latest version. But research by brand monitoring firm Morning Consult Intelligence suggests Musk's activities have indeed harmed Tesla, particularly in the EU and Canada \u2013 although not in China, which remains one of its biggest markets. In the US, it says, the situation is more nuanced, with many consumers approving of DOGE cuts in government spending. However it adds: \"Musk may be turning off those US consumers most likely to buy a Tesla. Among high-income consumers who say they plan to purchase an EV in the future, Tesla now ranks lower compared with competitors than it did one year ago.\" Tesla did not respond to the BBC's questions concerning its fall in sales. But experts believe Tesla's problems run deeper than simply questions about the public image of the CEO. To start with, the current model range, which was once cutting edge, now looks uninspiring. The once ground-breaking Model S has been on sale since 2012, the Model X since 2015. Even the more recent and more affordable Model 3 and Model Y are beginning to look dated in an increasingly competitive market. \"If you look at their product line-up, they haven't had any fresh models recently, except for the Cybertruck, which is really niche,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty. \"They've had a refresh of the Model Y, but it's not a big splash. And there's so much more competition out there.\" Prof Peter Wells, director of Cardiff University's Centre for Automotive Industry Research, makes a similar point: \"We've not seen the level of innovation in terms of the product range that perhaps Elon Musk should have been looking for. I think that is a big part of their problem.\" Competition comes from a number of directions. Traditional manufacturers have invested huge sums in moving towards EV production, with the likes of Korea's Kia and Hyundai building a growing reputation for making good quality battery-powered cars. At the same time, an array of new EV brands has emerged from China. They include the likes of BYD, which has expanded rapidly by supplying cars with good performance at low prices, as well as the more upmarket Xpeng and Nio, which have focused on luxury and advanced technology. \"China has amazing incentives and subsidies for EVs,\" says Ms Valdez Streaty. \"You can see how Chinese firms, especially BYD, continue to grow not only in China but in other parts of the world. So that definitely is a huge threat, not just for Tesla but for other manufacturers as well.\" The extent of that threat was demonstrated in mid-March, when BYD announced it had developed an ultra-fast charging system that would provide a car with 250 miles of range in just five minutes \u2013 significantly faster than Tesla's own supercharger network. Musk's comments during Tesla's earnings calls suggests his priorities lie elsewhere, particularly in driverless vehicles. In January, he claimed Tesla would have a robotaxi service operating in Texas by June. But this attracted a cynical response from some commentators who pointed out that Musk has been promising this kind of thing for a long time. In 2019, for example, he said that within a year there would be a million Teslas on the road capable of acting as robotaxis. Meanwhile Tesla's \"Full Self Driving\" package, available to Tesla buyers, remains a \"hands-on\" system that requires the driver to be paying attention at all times. \"Every year we get a new promise from Elon Musk about how his autonomous cars are just around the corner. The trouble is, they never seem to be able to find the corner to emerge from,\" says Jay Nagley of automotive consultancy Redspy. Arguably, Tesla needs strong leadership right now. But regardless of his politics, the chief executive is spinning a large number of plates. He owns or runs an array of other businesses, notably his social media platform X; the artificial intelligence firm xAI; and the private space firm SpaceX, which has experienced failures on the last two launches of its giant Starship rocket. Asked in a recent interview with Fox Business how he was combining all of this with his new government role, Musk responded \"with great difficulty\". \"It's hard to tell exactly how much Tesla is hands-on managed nowadays by Musk,\" says Prof Wells. \"If he's making the key decisions over things like product placing and where factories are built and so forth, then those decisions have to be correct. And I think you need someone with a hands-on, 100% commitment to understanding the automotive industry, and making those decisions correctly.\" Ever since he joined Tesla in 2004, Elon Musk's position has been unassailable. There is no obvious sign at the moment of that changing. He remains the company's largest single shareholder, with a 13% stake \u2013 currently worth more than $95bn. That is more or less matched by the combined holdings of investment giants Vanguard and Blackrock, while a number of other financial institutions including State Street Bank and Morgan Stanley hold smaller stakes. For those investors, the recent falls in the share price will have made grim reading. But it is still almost 30% higher than it was a year ago. In fact, the recent decline has simply wiped out the effects of a dramatic surge that occurred immediately after the election, which almost doubled Tesla's market valuation. Today, Tesla is still valued at more than 100 times its earnings \u2013 a far higher margin than automotive rivals such as Ford, General Motors or Toyota, which suggests shareholders are continuing to pin their hopes on technological breakthroughs and rapid growth. \"Tesla is being valued as a company that is either going to dominate electric vehicles \u2013 which is clearly not going to happen, given the strength of the Chinese manufacturers \u2013 or that is going to dominate robotaxis and autonomous vehicles,\" says Mr Nagley. None of the major investors appears to be agitating for change at the moment \u2013  although in media interviews this week, one long-term shareholder-turned-vocal critic, the investment fund manager Ross Gerber, did call for Mr Musk to step down. But analysts say the business would benefit from new blood at the top. \"A new CEO for Tesla would without question be the best thing for the company right now,\" says Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research. \"It would address the toxic contagion from Musk, offer a solution for the conflict of interest regarding his DOGE position, and allow a dedicated CEO to focus entirely on the job in hand.\" \"I think that's the clear direction of travel at the moment.\" says Prof Wells. \"I think they need somebody with strong automotive experience. Someone who knows how to rationalise the business. \"It needs a significant change of direction now.\" BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Business Insider Edition  Investor Danny Moses, best known for his prescient bet against mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis, is sounding the alarm again \u2014 this time over the markets failure to properly account for the economic fallout from aggressive federal spending cuts.          I think we are underestimating the impact to the economy of the cuts were making at the federal government, and what that might mean in terms of knock-on effects, Moses, founder of Moses Ventures, told Power Lunch show host Kelly Evans on CNBC on Thursday.               \"I think were hurting the revenue side of the equation,\" he added.               Cost-cutting measures have been spearheaded by the White House DOGE office, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk as its public face. The Trump administration has overseen the firing of at least 25,000 federal probationary workers across 18 agencies within months, though the fate of many of those jobs is still in legal limbo. The upheaval could imperil safety nets like Social Security and Medicare, programs which tens of millions of people rely on.               Musk and Trump have said that much of the federal spending is \"wasteful\" and \"fraudulent,\" though there has thus far been no publicly available evidence that anyone in the federal government has committed the crime of fraud.               On top of DOGE cuts, economic uncertainty has followed Trumps on-again, off-again tariffs, stoking recession fears. The S&P 500 struggled to regain ground after a sharp pullback, and remains at about 8% below its February all-time high.               Moses said that first-quarter earnings reports will likely reveal signs of a market slowdown, with consumer confidence already showing weakness. He added that investors could be in for a potential shock, because the risks of economic downturn haven't been fully priced into the markets yet.               When your debt-to-GDP is over 120%, you really cant afford to make a mistake, said Moses, referring to America's government debt-to-GDP ratio. I think we are being overly optimistic about how this is going to play out.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Business Insider Edition  Superstar influencer Emma Chamberlain's coffee brand has big ambitions but experienced growing pains last year \u2014 and they're both detailed in a pitch deck obtained by Business Insider.          Chamberlain Coffee hit some bumps last year, partly due to supplier issues that led to stocking problems at stores, the 2024 deck revealed. But it expected to bounce back in a major way, with the deck projecting revenue to grow by more than 50% in 2025 to over $33 million.               The deck said the company eyed a \"strong path to profitability by 2026.\" It's now expecting to reach that goal this year, a person familiar with the company told BI.               Late last year, it started prioritizing profitability over aggressive growth, this person said. After significant cost-cutting, it was in the black for the first two months of the year and expects to be profitable for all of 2025.               Chamberlain, now 23, catapulted to internet fame by posting funny videos about her mundane teenage life before becoming a high-fashion star. She's represented brands including Louis Vuitton and Cartier and played Vogue's red-carpet correspondent at the Met Gala.               She's one of the internet's most influential creators, with over 12 million YouTube subscribers and nearly 15 million Instagram followers. She cracked Time magazine's list of the 25 most influential people on the internet when she was just 18, and ranked No. 14 on Forbes' list of top creators last year.               Like many creators, including MrBeast, Chamberlain is now also a big business. She parlayed her online fame into a line of consumer goods,\u00a0launching Chamberlain Coffee, a product that befits her longtime coffee habit, in 2019. (\"I drank so much coffee I literally feel buzzed,\" Chamberlain said in a 2019 video.)               In the era of the multi-hyphenate, many celebrities have made forays into product lines and other businesses. Some have found success. Bloomberg recently reported that MrBeast was making more money from his chocolate bars than his videos. But some categories have become crowded with similar product offerings, and The Information reported last month that certain investors had soured on celebrity brands in general. Some celebrity-fronted production companies have also faced recent challenges as Hollywood has pared back on spending.               As celebrities build businesses across various sectors \u2014\u00a0harnessing the power of the creator economy \u2014 the successes and failures of different brands are closely watched by would-be investors and the broader public.               The deck and other information gathered by BI provide a picture of Chamberlain Coffee's trajectory over the past year, as well as more recent tweaks to its strategy.               The company grew aggressively, going from selling in 500 to 10,000 stores in one year as it cracked Target, Whole Foods, Walmart, and more. It added new products in colorful cans and packaging with an emphasis on cold drinks. In January, it opened a brick-and-mortar caf in Los Angeles where fans can sip her signature cold brew.               Still, Chamberlain's brand has encountered challenges familiar to many startups, as the leaked deck reveals. It contains data up to the second quarter of 2024 and projects performance for 2025 and beyond.               Last year, Chamberlain Coffee went out to investors in search of another $5 million to $10 million. (The company previously said it had raised a combined $14 million in 2022 and 2023 rounds, led by investors including Blazar Capital, UTA, and Volition Capital.) It was able to raise an undisclosed amount in recent months, the person familiar with the company said.               In the 2024 fundraising deck, Chamberlain Coffee acknowledged growing pains, which it blamed on issues caused by a former co-packer \u2014 a company that handles packaging and labeling for consumer products \u2014 that led to Chamberlain's coffee being out of stock at some retailers.               It also referred to the work it was doing to get the product mix and formulations right. In the deck, the company forecast that 2024 revenue would grow 14% to $22 million after nearly doubling two years before. Some of the details in the deck were previously reported by The Ankler.               Chamberlain Coffee said in the deck that it was fixing these problems. The company said it was working with larger-scale suppliers to grow retail sales, its biggest channel, and planned to double its promotional spending. After focusing on a larger mass-market expansion, it's now concentrating on certain retailers like Whole Foods, Sprouts, and Target, the person familiar with the company said.               The deck also laid out the brand's plan to expand its line of matcha, which it characterized as beloved by Gen Z. In fact, the brand's appeal to Gen Z is a big part of its positioning in the deck.               It categorizes rival brands like this: Folgers is for boomers, Starbucks and La Colombe are for Gen X, and Blue Bottle and Stumptown Coffee Roasters are for millennials. But Chamberlain Coffee is made for Gen Z, with its emphasis on canned coffee, flavored drinks, and matcha. The company said in the deck that pre-made drinks and packaged coffees each made up about a third of the company's retail sales at the time, with matcha making up a fifth of sales.               In the deck, Chamberlain Coffee also emphasized the company's ties to its famous founder and ability to drive promotion based on her popularity, citing collabs with Kendall Jenner's 818 tequila brand, Levi's, Erewhon, and others. It pointed to the exposure it's scored from stars like Shawn Mendes and Kylie Jenner.               Looking forward, the deck outlined the company's bet on cafs, which it saw as a way to increase awareness of the brand and cross-sell bagged coffee and canned drinks alongside brewed coffee and pastries. It expected the first caf to generate $1.8 million with a 17% EBITDA margin. The deck said the first five cafs would be jointly funded by an unnamed partner that would fully fund the expansion.               The company saw an exit in its future, with the deck saying it was on the radar of several industry players. It listed Coca-Cola, Nestl, and JDE Peet's among potential acquirers.               Here are some key slides from the deck Chamberlain Coffee used to pitch investors in 2024 on its next phase of growth:       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

(Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut\/SOPA Images\/LightRocket via Getty Images) One of the biggest losers from the Mag 7 during earnings season was Nvidia (NVDA). I called a top for NVDA back in August 2024 and am not surprised to see it fall precipitously after reporting excellent earnings. The narrative that valuation does not matter is being disproved before our very eyes \u2013 along with many other false narratives that have plagued our society. If you\u2019ve been following my reports on the company\u2019s stock, you would know that the recent drop in price is still not nearly enough to make the stock attractive. NVDA is not alone. Crowded trades and overvalued stocks are everywhere. Good stocks are harder and harder to find as the market was hitting new highs. Accordingly, I see opportunity in market pull backs. I see a golden era for stocks over the next couple of years as markets exorcise more false narratives (remember NFTs\u2026haha) and embrace fundamentals again. Meanwhile, my firm\u2019s proven-superior research continues to give an edge in finding good stocks. I work harder and smarter with my firm\u2019s Robo-Analyst AI to scour the markets and the data to identify the stocks, ETFs and mutual funds with the best risk\/reward. I previously made HCA Healthcare Inc (HCA) a Long Idea in June 2020, and have reiterated my bullish view on the stock many times. Since my original report, HCA has outperformed as a Long Idea by 137%, rising 224% while the S&P is up 87%. Even after outpacing the overall market, HCA Healthcare remains a strong business and very attractive stock. HCA Healthcare has steadily grown its top- and bottom-line since 2007. HCA Healthcare has grown revenue by 6% and net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) by 8% compounded annually since 2007. See Figure 1. The company has improved its NOPAT margin from 10.2% in 2007 to 11.9% in 2024 while increasing invested capital turns from 1.32 to 1.48 over the same time. Rising operational and capital efficiency drive return on invested capital (ROIC) from 13% in 2007 to 18% in 2024.

HCA Healthcare\u2019s total admissions grew from 1.8 million in 2014 to 2.2 million in 2024, or 2% compounded annually.

Figure 2: HCA Healthcare\u2019s Number of Admissions and Hospitals: 2014 \u2013 2024 HCA Admissions & Hospitals 2014-2024 Hospital operators, such as HCA Healthcare, benefit from consistent, and long-term, tailwinds of an aging population and rising healthcare costs. In 2022, 17% of the U.S population was 65 years or older. That percentage is expected to increase to 22% by 2040. The population of those aged 85+ is also expected to double from 2022 to 2040. As populations age, healthcare spending increases. In fact, per capita healthcare spending for those aged 65-84 is 1.6x higher than those aged 45-64 and 3.1x higher than those aged 19-44. Rising spend from an aging population drives projections for continued growth in hospital spending. According to the Peterson KFF Health System Tracker, the annual hospital spending is expected to grow: With its industry leading position and superior profitability (more on that below), HCA Healthcare is well-positioned to capitalize on steady growth in healthcare spending for years to come. Since 2018, HCA Healthcare has paid $3.8 billion (5% of market cap) in cumulative dividends and has increased its quarterly dividends from $0.35\/share in February 2018 to $0.72\/share in March 2025. The company\u2019s current dividend, when annualized, provides a 0.8% yield. HCA also returns capital to shareholders through share repurchases. From 2018 through 2024, the company repurchased $28.1 billion (34% of market cap) of shares. $16.9 billion of this repurchase activity occurred from 2022-2024. In January 2025, HCA Healthcare\u2019s board of directors authorized a new $10 billion share repurchase program. Management noted in the 4Q24 earnings call that they \u201canticipate completing a significant portion in 2025.\u201d Should the company repurchase shares at its 2024 rate, it would repurchase $6.0 billion of shares in 2025, which equals 7.3% of the current market cap. When combined, the dividend and share repurchase yield could reach 8.1%. HCA generates enough free cash flow (FCF) to cover both its share repurchases and regular dividend payments. From 2018 to 2024, HCA generated $30.9 billion in FCF while paying $3.8 billion in dividends and $28.1 billion in repurchases, for total capital return of $31.9 billion. I like companies that choose to return so much capital to shareholders instead of spending it on executive bonuses or acquisitions. See Figure 3. Figure 3: HCA Healthcare\u2019s Free Cash Flow Vs. Cash Dividends Paid: 2018 Through 2024 HCA FCF and Dividends 2018-2024 HCA Healthcare has generated positive free cash flow (FCF) in every year of my model on an annual basis. On a quarterly basis, the company has generated positive FCF in 46 of the past 52 quarters. Since 2018, HCA Healthcare generated $30.9 billion (23% of enterprise value) in FCF. See Figure 4. Figure 4: HCA Healthcare\u2019s Cumulative FCF Since 2018 HCA Free Cash Flow 2018-2024 HCA Healthcare was the most profitable healthcare company amongst its peers when I originally wrote my Long Idea report, and it remains #1 today. It is also the largest hospital operator by revenue and number of locations. HCA Healthcare\u2019s ROIC and invested capital turns are higher than all peers, while the company\u2019s NOPAT margin surpasses all but one of its publicly traded competitors. Competitors in this analysis include Encompass Health (EHC), Tenet Healthcare (THC), Universal Health Services (UHS), and more, per Figure 5. Figure 5: HCA Healthcare\u2019s Profitability Vs. Peers: Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) HCA Profitability vs Competitors Skilled labor in the healthcare industry remains in short supply. Job satisfaction for Registered Nurses (RN) and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN) remains low since COVID-19 due to increased levels of stress and excessive work hours. Many nurses also left the workforce after Covid. Worse yet, a significant segment of the nursing workforce is nearing retirement age, while too few new nurses are entering the workforce. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), nursing enrollment is not growing fast enough to meet the projected demand for RN and APRN services. Hiring enough labor continues to be a headwind for the whole healthcare industry, including HCA. However, the company is taking steps to recruit and retain quality employees. In the 4Q24 earnings call, management noted that employee engagement is \u201cat an all-time high\u201d, which has allowed the company to \u201creduce turnover and improve the capabilities of our facilities with having continuity and staffing\u2026\u201d Furthermore, the company continues to hire nurses from Galen College, one of the largest nursing schools in the U.S., in which HCA Healthcare acquired a majority stake in 2020. The cost of goods is rising, and the potential for newly administered tariffs to drive costs even higher remains a risk for many companies. In the 4Q24 earnings call, HCA Healthcare management noted that they\u2019ve been working on tariff mitigation strategies for years to manage the cost of supplies needed to operate its hospitals. Importantly, management noted that in 2025, 70% of its supplies are already contracted with firm pricing, which could help mitigate any increased supply cost when and if mass tariffs are enacted. Importantly, HCA Healthcare is already priced as if tariffs and labor costs will hurt the business and result in deteriorating profitability. Management\u2019s ability to mitigate these challenges creates increased upside in shares, as I\u2019ll show below. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze expectations for different stock price scenarios for HCA. At its current price, HCA\u2019s price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio is 1.0, which means the market expects its NOPAT to never grow from current levels. For context, HCA has grown its NOPAT by 8% compounded annually since 2014 and 7% compounded annually since 2007. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume: the stock is worth $319\/share today \u2013 nearly equal to the current stock price. For reference, the revenue growth in this scenario would be below consensus expectations of 5.7% growth in 2025 and 5.1% growth in 2026. In this scenario, HCA\u2019s NOPAT grows just 1% compounded annually from 2025 \u2013 2034, which is well below historical growth rates. If I instead assume: the stock is worth $435\/share today \u2013 a 36% upside to the current price. In this scenario, HCA\u2019s NOPAT would grow 4% compounded annually from 2025 to 2034. Should the company\u2019s NOPAT grow more in line with historical levels, the stock has even more upside.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"There have been a number of rumours surrounding a foldable iPhone of late, and in fact, there have been a couple of suggestions of a foldable iPad too with a screen that extends to 18.8-inches, making it a couple of inches larger than the biggest MacBook.\u00a0 Despite Apple having not entered the foldable market as yet though, it\u2019s possible that it won\u2019t just be a foldable iPhone or iPad on the cards when it does. A recent patent, spotted by Apple Insider, has indicated that a foldable Apple Watch could be a possibility at some point in the future. We know, we know, sounds very farfetched, doesn\u2019t it? The patent is for a \u201cWearable Electronic Device\u201d, and it talks about this device including a display that can be folded or extended. The \u201cwearable electronic device, such as a smartwatch, can include a display with an extendable screen size,\u201d the patent application suggests, before adding \u201cin particular, the display can be folded to be compact, and the display can be extended when increased screen size is desired\u201d.\u00a0 It also talks about various use cases you might want a foldable Apple Watch for, or a foldable wearable electronic device we should say. The patent reads: \u201cA user may want the display to be extended when using certain applications, making phone\/ video calls, playing games, browsing the web, etc.\u201d It appreciates that an Apple Watch folding out into an iPhone-like device won\u2019t work for everyday activities however, adding: \u201cOn the other hand, the user may want the display to be folded for convenience and portability, such as when the user is going about their day-to-day activities, outdoor activities, etc.\u201d When the Apple Watch first launched it was reliant on the iPhone, and that\u2019s still true to some extent, though you can now get models with cellular connection, and the Apple Watch has its own App Store too. If this patent ever resulted in an actual device however, the folding Apple Watch would surely be independent of the iPhone given it would seemingly have its own camera and smarts to allow you to do most of what you would do on your iPhone on your wrist.\u00a0 It\u2019s worth pointing out that Apple \u2013 and others \u2013 file hundreds of patents every year and not all result in an actual product so we may never see a folding Apple Watch. It\u2019s interesting that it\u2019s a consideration though.\u00a0 I\u2019ve been an Apple Fitness+ subscriber since late 2024. Notice how I didn\u2019t say I\u2019ve been using Apple Fitness+ since then? It\u2019s because it has taken me until recently to find a workout plan that keeps me coming back. I love it, and here are the four reasons I think you will too. What\u2019s the workout? I\u2019m just finishing the Three Perfect Weeks of Strength workout plan in Apple Fitness+. It was introduced at the beginning of 2025, and is the first extended workout plan specifically created by some of the Fitness+ trainers. There are four different workouts of 30 minutes each to do each week over a three week period, and as the name suggests, it\u2019s focused on strength, but this single word doesn\u2019t best describe the content. Over the years, Apple has employed various materials for its Apple Watch, including aluminum, ceramic, stainless steel, and titanium. While glass has sometimes been used for the display, it has never been used for the entire watch. Is an all-glass Apple Watch in the future? Probably not, but some signs suggest Cupertino is at least contemplating this possibility. Apple is expected to launch its first \u201ciPhone Fold\u201d in 2026, several years after rival companies like Samsung and OnePlus have already released their own foldable devices. The reason for Apple\u2019s delay in entering the foldable market is not entirely clear. However, one plausible explanation is that Apple has focused on ensuring the device offers a seamless transition between the outer and inner displays. This week, it was reported that Apple plans to use a liquid metal hinge in the iPhone Fold. This innovation aims to enhance durability and reduce the visibility of the display crease. Creasing was a significant issue for early foldable devices, such as the first Samsung Galaxy Z Fold, but it has improved considerably over the years. \r Please enable Javascript to view this content  Upgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Business Insider Edition  Nvidia shares flashed the dreaded \"death cross\" signal on Thursday.          The technical sell signal occurs when the 200-day moving average rises above the 50-day moving average.               The stock's 50-day moving average hit $127.39, dipping below the 200-day moving average of $127.73 early in Thursday's trading session before paring losses to rise about 1%.               The moving average crossover strategy can signal a reversal in a prior trend, suggesting that after a massive 948% rally since October 2022, shares of Nvidia could be on the verge of a downtrend.               The last time Nvidia flashed a death cross signal was in April 2022, amid a broader bear market for stocks. Shares of Nvidia went on to decline 47% before they bottomed out in October 2022.               Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer & Co., said the death cross signal in Nvidia shares isn't a foolproof signal of a coming decline, and could ultimately be a head fake.               \"While every major decline starts with a 'death cross' not every 'death cross' leads to a major decline,\" Wald told BI.               Instead, the current death cross in Nvidia shares could reflect the stock's range-bound behavior for nearly a year.               \"The stock has shown a loss of momentum for a number of months which can be shown by the fact the stock has made little progress over the last 6-9 months,\" Wald said.               He added that he is staying on the sidelines with Nvidia stock until the broader market shows signs that it's bottomed after its latest decline. The S&P 500 entered correction territory last week, falling 10% from its peak in February.               \"For now, we'd continue to respect the continued deterioration in the stock's trend, including the most recent 'death cross,'\" Wald said.               Wald sees $128 as a key resistance level and $100 as key support for Nvidia shares.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Business Insider Edition  A battle is brewing between the titans of the US gambling industry and challenger brands pioneering areas like sweepstakes, predictions markets, and new daily fantasy models.          We recently attended Next.io's Next Summit in New York to check the vibes from its roughly 1,000 gambling industry investors, entrepreneurs, and executives. This year, tensions between the big betting companies and disrupters surfaced on panels and in talks among insiders.               Emerging formats like prediction markets are gaining traction in the US and are regulated differently from sports betting and online gambling. In some cases, that means they can reach a wider audience, creating a threat \u2014 or opportunity \u2014 for gambling companies.               Prediction markets from Crypto.com, Kalshi, and Polymarket, for example, are legal in all 50 US states. These companies recently started offering contracts on sports. People buy \"yes\" or \"no\" on outcomes, like whether Duke will win the March Madness men's tournament. There are no money lines, point spreads, or parlays. Still, sports predictions function a lot like online sports betting, which is only legal in 33 states.               The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is reviewing sports prediction markets and could still shut them down, but a nationwide version of sports betting could change the industry's dynamics. Prediction markets are regulated at the federal level, while gambling is a state issue.               \"The CFTC-mediated sports prediction markets could really upend that dynamic,\" investor Chris Grove, cofounder and general partner of Acies Investments, said at the event.               Grove thinks gambling operators could consider pushing into predictions. He also said that by the end of the year, if apps like Kalshi are still in sports, they could evolve to offer full-game parlays, making them even more like sports betting.               \"I don't think prediction markets are going to change everything, but I think they will threaten to change a lot of things, and being ignorant to those threats is probably the biggest risk for everyone in this room,\" Grove said.               Sports predictions and other emerging categories, such as sweepstakes that are free to enter and pick 'em fantasy sports that riff on gambling's parlay model with picks on a selection of player stats, were big themes at the conference \u2014 as were AI, crypto gaming, M&A, and the impact of the Trump administration and tariffs.               Here were the topics insiders were buzzing about at the conference:               AI was one of the biggest themes, including how potential bettors and gambling companies use it.               AI-powered searches can take traffic from Google and other search engines where gambling companies acquire users. Grove said during his presentation that AI is \"disrupting\" that model.               \"The operators who are fastest to learn how to optimize the AI-driven search landscape are likely to realize substantial consumer and margin gains,\" Grove said. \"I think we could see a reshaping of market share in the process.\"               AI could also be used in online games. Justin Park, the CEO of Canada-based online slots company Betty, said AI could be used to develop new slot experiences since they use random number generators.               Microsoft had a big presence at the conference with a panel on how to use generative AI in games through Microsoft Muse.               Warren Cho, Microsoft's worldwide gaming vertical leader, said his previous manager had an \"allergic reaction\" when he said he wanted to work with gambling companies. But the US tech giant has since expanded its work with brands in Europe, where sports betting is \"part of the culture,\" and is looking to do more in regulated markets.               There's a particularly fierce lobbying war surrounding sweepstakes. They resemble online casino games but are free to play and typically have a freemium model where users buy and bet digital coins.               Grove and others said online gambling operators had been trying to \"tamp down\" competition from sweepstakes.               The category has faced regulatory pushback similar to what pick- 'em fantasy encountered a few years ago, with states like New York looking to ban it.               Erik Nyman, president of Americas for supplier EveryMatrix, said in one session that vendors need to \"pick a side\" between gambling and sweepstakes in markets where the latter is unregulated.               But these sweepstakes companies are also amassing war chests they could use to fight back as they make more money.               \"This is the United States, legislation gets put forth by people who are well organized and who have money and lobbyists and interest, and legislation is successfully opposed in the exact same way,\" said Bill Gantz, a partner at Duane Morris LLP who has been involved in social casino litigation.               Categories like sweepstakes have become a sore spot as the expansion of online casino legislation has all but ground to a halt, and some lawmakers have sought to rein in sports betting. Still, some insiders think sweepstakes could make lawmakers more comfortable with gambling in the long run since these games are free to enter.               \"Social sweepstakes is an answer to the online casino legislation logjam,\" Grove said.       Crypto gaming was hot.               And then it wasn't.               It seems to be back again this year.               Investors on an M&A panel predicted a crypto exchange or retail trading app could buy a betting company. Roger Ehrenberg at Eberg Capital said crypto was a \"complete unlock\" for the gambling industry.               Uncertainty around tariffs and inflation has dragged down the stock market this month.               But perhaps the biggest hit to the US gambling industry so far has come from our neighbors to the North.               Relationships between some US and Canadian gambling companies appear to be souring in the fallout of Trump's tariff policy and 51st-state remarks. Leaders in key Canadian markets with legal gambling, including Ontario and British Columbia, have called for retaliatory measures on US businesses.               Two gambling insiders told BI that in response, some Canadian companies are canceling contracts with US companies.Canadian customers are also boycotting US betting brands and looking to homegrown alternatives.               \"We're not going to take it lying down,\" said Paul Burns, President and CEO of the Canadian Gaming Association, of President Donald Trump's recent Canada comments.               Despite the tensions and overall economic uncertainty, the broader outlook among gambling companies was relatively rosy.               Investors at Next Summit predicted an uptick in M&A in the next 12 to 24 months.               Insiders on the ground talked up nascent areas that could benefit from the Trump administration's policies, such as crypto gambling and prediction markets. And the trade group, the American Gaming Association, pointed to Trump's experience in the gambling business. President and CEO Bill Miller called Trump a \"casino guy\" who has always treated the industry fairly.               Gambling is positioning itself as entertainment, and companies are borrowing tactics from Hollywood and social media. Insiders drew several comparisons to Netflix, including DraftKings' chief product officer Corey Gottlieb who said onstage that his team modeled its casino app after the streamer's user experience.               Betr, a sports media and betting company cofounded by influencer Jake Paul and entrepreneur Joey Levy, has podcasts with high-profile influencers like \"Hawk Tuah Girl\" Haliey Welch. The company said it'd love to do a deal with YouTube's biggest star, MrBeast.               Edward King, cofounding partner and co-chief investment officer of Acies Investments, added there's a big opportunity for entrepreneurs.               \"This should be viewed as an entertainment industry, and what is it you could do to bring that person in?\" he said. \"And if you do that then the industry is going to increase in size by about fivefold.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Business Insider Edition  The party started as so many do \u2014 with pancakes in a parking lot.          I attended Nvidia's GTC conference, which has taken over downtown San Jose, California, this week. Tuesday was the biggest day for the AI juggernaut. At 10 a.m. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang began his keynote address, which lasted more than two and a half hours.           But first, breakfast.               It was a chilly early morning in San Jose. The \"pregame\" started at 6:30 a.m. with breakfast from Denny's, the restaurant where Huang came up with the idea for Nvidia. I needed to know who would show up more than three hours early for a speech about computer chips.               When I arrived just before 7 a.m., the line was already substantial. A massive red mobile Denny's kitchen was cooking up \"Nvidia bytes\" \u2014 essentially sausages and pancakes. Diners were encouraged to wrap up their bytes like a taco and add syrup on top, like Huang does.               I chatted with some of the early birds. Some were die-hard Nvidia fans. Some were jet-lagged, having flown in the day before from London or Toronto, so they were up anyway. Some wanted to get into the SAP Center as soon as the stadium doors opened to avoid the massive lines that would form the hour before the speech. Some heard a rumor that Huang himself might stop by the tailgate.               And sure enough, by 7:25 a.m., muscled men in suits with earpieces started multiplying. With no fanfare, Huang walked out from behind the registration tent wearing his signature uniform, all black and a leather moto jacket. The bleary-eyed crowds sprung into action \u2014 phones up for photos.               Huang donned an apron and went inside the food truck to make some pancakes, as he had as a 15-year-old Denny's employee.               \"At this pace, I'd run the company out of business. I used to be a lot faster,\" he said of his chef skills after emerging from the kitchen and immediately meeting CNBC reporter Kristina Partsinevelos and a camera crew.               Partsinevelos tried to ground the conversation, but Huang was all jokes.               \"You're talking about the stock? I'm talking about Denny's!\" he said.               By 8:15 a.m., Huang disappeared into the SAP Center, where he turned up on the pre-show panel airing live inside the stadium.               As I reached myfloor seat, the panel was giving a reverent retrospective of the company \u2014 including its many brushes with failure before AI changed everything.               Leading up to the speech, Nvidia's partner companies were eager to find out if they would garner a mention on one of tech's brightest stages. One Nvidia employee told me that up to the last minute, a local war room of Nvidia employees was tweaking the company's dozens of announcements.               Once the speech starts, it was all in Huang's hands.               He kicked off by firing T-shirts into the crowd from an Nvidia-green T-shirt cannon.               \"I just want you to know that I'm up here without a net. There are no scripts, there's no teleprompter, and I've got a lot of things to cover. So let's get started,\" Huang said.               The 62-year-old CEO proceeded to blow through his scheduled two hours.               He focused on Nvidia's advancements, a flurry of new partnerships and software tools for AI developers, and coming chip architecturesthat could underpin the computation speed and efficiency that creates new industries. These are already creating what Huang calls \"AI Factories.\"           He also spoke on the challenges of realizing the AI-enabled future he has promised for years. He addressed shortages of fresh data to feed AI models, limitations in the ever-important training phase, and energy constraints.           The world of computing has reached a \"tipping point,\" and the \"platform shift\" to accelerated computing is well underway, he said.               The crowd stayed rapt, although a little antsy at the two-hour mark. But the final video clip reenergized the room. A Disney-designed robot named Blue, which looked like part of the Star Wars universe, toddled through a desert and then ascended \u2014 for real \u2014 from below the stage.               Then the crowd jumped to their feet and raised their phones.               \"Have a great GTC! Thank you! Hey, Blue, let's go home. Good job,\" said Jensen.               After the speech, thousands of attendees streamed into the downtown San Jose streets. The SAP Center, which had only a few empty seats, holds 17,500, and 25,000 people were expected at this year's event.               The crowds made their way back to Plaza de Cesar Chavez, temporarily renamed GTC Park, to find lunch at the procession of food trucks on-site daily. Attendees again had to wait in long lines.               The lunch lines were just one of many signs that GTC has outgrown its traditional home. Lines to get into the San Jose Convention Center's conference sessions snaked through the hallways.               Nvidia still calls GTC a developer conference, though the evolution from technical developer confab to serious dealmaking destination was on display at a swanky building next to the convention center dedicated only to business meetings. The elevators couldn't handle the volume of people constantly coming in and out.               Even Nvidia team members arriving just behind me balked and abandoned ship to relocate when they saw the lines. Getting from the sidewalk to the meeting room inside the building took 35 minutes.               \"The only way to hold more people at GTC is we're going to have to grow San Jose, and we're working on it,\" said Huang during the keynote.               Logistics aside, I soon met with Kimberly Powell, Nvidia's vice president of healthcare, who detailed the many ways Nvidia's accelerated computing is changing how doctors and hospitals work.               She said it could be decades before robots can actually perform surgeries without human assistance. But companies like Moon Surgical are already creating surgical assistance robots to hold cameras and tools with arms that never tire. Nvidia also works with da Vinci robots, which can suture wounds, among other tasks.               I then headed back to the convention center to walk the exhibition floor during happy hour, where I saw some of the technology Powell championed on display. Because Nvidia's impact spans many industries, the floor showcased cars, vacuuming robots, simulated human bodies ready for surgery, and all the biggest names in cloud computing.               I also passed the Nvidia gear store, which was booming. A worker there told me the 2025 GTC T-shirt and puffer vests were the biggest sellers.               My 12-hour Tuesday at the conference ended at the GTC Night Market back in the park. The setup was an homage to Huang's love of Taiwan's night markets, with live music, drinks, local food like bao buns, yakitori, cupcakes, and a punnily-named \"juice\" bar sponsored by GPU cloud provider Coreweave.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  UNH Stock   UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) stock is up 5% in a week, following a recovery in the broader markets, with the S&P 500 index rising 1.5% over this period. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, delivering on market expectations with unchanged interest rates and a less hawkish tone than anticipated, triggered a broad market rally on Wednesday, March 19. Amid the current volatility and a rise in UNH stock, we think it still looks attractive - making it a good pick to buy at its current price of around $500. We believe there are some minor concerns with UNH stock, which makes it attractive given that its current valuation looks low.  We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of UNH stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of UnitedHealth along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, UNH stock looks slightly cheap compared to the broader market. \u2022 UnitedHealth has a price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 1.2 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500  \u2022 Additionally, the company\u2019s price-to-operating income (P\/EBIT) ratio is 16 compared to 24.3 for S&P 500  \u2022 And, it has a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 32 vs. the benchmark\u2019s 24.3 UnitedHealth's Revenues have seen notable growth over recent years. \u2022 UnitedHealth has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 12% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.3% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Its revenues have grown 7.7% from $372 Bil to $400 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Also, its quarterly revenues grew 6.8% year-over-year to $101 Bil in the most recent quarter (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500) UnitedHealth\u2019s profit margins are much worse than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. It is because of UnitedHealth\u2019s nature of high-volume and low-margin business.  \u2022 UnitedHealth\u2019s Operating Income over the last four quarters was $32 Bil, which represents a low Operating Margin of 8.1% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500)  \u2022 UnitedHealth\u2019s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $24 Bil, pointing to a low OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 6.0% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500) UnitedHealth's balance sheet looks strong. \u2022 UnitedHealth\u2019s Debt figure was $77 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $464 Bil (as of 3\/19\/2025). This implies a strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 17% (vs. 19.0% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable]  \u2022 Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $29 Bil of the $298 Bil in Total Assets for UnitedHealth. This yields a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 10% (vs. 14.8% for S&P 500) UNH stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on UNH stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. \u2022 UNH stock fell 17.2% from a high of $546.01 on 20 April 2022 to $452.06 on 20 June 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 16 August 2022  \u2022 Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $625.25 on 11 November 2024 and currently trades at around $500 \u2022 UNH stock fell 36.2% from a high of $305.31 on 19 February 2020 to $194.86 on 23 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 1 June 2020 \u2022 UNH stock fell 72.4% from a high of $58.99 on 23 December 2007 to $16.30 on 20 November 2008, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 2 April 2012 In summary, UnitedHealth's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: \u2022 Growth: Very Strong  \u2022 Profitability: Very Weak  \u2022 Financial Stability: Strong  \u2022 Downturn Resilience: Very Strong  \u2022 Overall: Neutral Taken together with its low valuation, this makes the stock look attractive, which supports our conclusion that UNH is a good stock to buy. In fact, we estimate UnitedHealth Group\u2019s valuation at $590 per share, reflecting a 17% upside from its current levels. Our forecast is based on 1.4x trailing sales, aligning with the stock\u2019s average price-to-sales ratio over the last five years.   While UNH stock looks promising, investing in a single stock can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Money, knowledge, and engineering can't replace manufacturing. Or can it?  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  The modern smartphone is a marvel of miniaturization, packing the power of a desktop computer into a device that fits in your hand. At the heart of this revolution lies the System on a Chip (SoC), a single integrated circuit that houses the CPU, GPU, modem, and a host of other specialized processors. While companies like Apple and Google are known for \"building\" custom smartphone chips, they don't actually manufacture them. Samsung also designs chips and can build them, albeit in a different division of the company. Qualcomm has changed the industry forever by designing things nobody could ever build without them, and the company lets others build the actual products. So, how do these tech giants design and bring these powerful components to life? The answer lies in a complex interplay of design expertise, intellectual property, and a specialized manufacturing ecosystem.  The journey begins with the design phase, where teams of engineers, architects, and researchers conceptualize the chip's architecture. This involves defining the chip's functionalities, performance targets, and power efficiency goals. For Apple, this means optimizing for iOS and its specific applications; for Google, it's about tailoring the chip to Android and its burgeoning AI capabilities. Samsung and Qualcomm need to build chips that anyone can use. It's not easy. The core of the chip's design is its architecture. This dictates the arrangement of the various processing units and how they interact. Apple, for instance, invests heavily in its custom CPU and GPU designs, aiming for superior performance per watt. Google, with its Tensor chips, focuses on integrating specialized AI accelerators for on-device machine learning. Qualcomm strikes a balance between performance in all areas and connectivity options. Each company knows what it needs better than anyone else does. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android  Once done on paper, engineers need to describe and build out the chip's logic. Hardware Description Languages (HDL) like Verilog or VHDL are used to \"program\" every behavior of the chip's circuits: every transistor, logic gate, and even the connections between them all. Once someone is satisfied that this is going to work, the testing begins before anything is ever built. Software is used to simulate various behaviors, looking for bottlenecks in performance and potential errors and determining what other IP could be licensed to make a chip even better. Nothing is built in a vacuum, and no one company can do it all; the best products are a happy collaboration. From there, the process is physically laid out by crazy smart people with backgrounds in electronics, physics, and manufacturing. Finally, parts can be built.  Apple or Qualcomm don't build their own chips. Neither does Google, and even the divisions at Samsung designing new products aren't usually the same ones creating them. For that, you need a semiconductor foundry. TSMC is one of the biggest, but there are others \u2014 including Samsung's own foundry. The company that designed the chip works very closely with the foundry. There's a lot of back and forth to optimize the design for better performance and ease of manufacturing, and the final specifications are drawn out before the first chip rolls off the line. The process of building a semiconductor is wild. Using complex masks and stencils, a chip is built layer by layer in rooms where not even a spec of dust is allowed. It's a total sci-fi vibe for a sci-fi product. The results are continually tested so the \"good\" chips make it to the customer who ordered them, then into your hands.  It's easy to think of fabless semiconductor design as sort of like outsourcing, but it's a lot more than just a cost-saving initiative. It allows a company like Apple or Qualcomm, who are well known for building excellent smartphone chips, to focus on the design and licensing of outside IP to build a product that meets consumer's exact needs. Instead of trying to build and maintain advanced state-of-the-art facilities, they can partner with a company that has both the means and the experience to do it right. This makes adapting to an ever-changing market much easier. Expertise in chip design, combined with strategic partnerships with leading manufacturers, allows them to create some of the most powerful and efficient smartphone chips on the market. This intricate ecosystem, where design expertise meets manufacturing prowess, is what drives the relentless innovation in the world of mobile technology.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  KYIV, UKRAINE - 2024\/01\/24: In this photo illustration, the Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. (CCI) logo is seen ... More on a smartphone and a PC screen. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar\/SOPA Images\/LightRocket via Getty Images)   Cleveland-Cliffs experienced a 15% decline over one month following its earnings announcement on February 24. The company reported a larger-than-expected loss of $0.68 per share and fell short of revenue expectations, which led to a significant drop in investor confidence. The global steel market is contending with weak demand and oversupply, putting downward pressure on steel prices. As a company heavily dependent on raw materials, Cleveland-Cliffs is particularly impacted by these conditions. However, tariffs on imported steel might benefit domestic producers like Cleveland-Cliffs \u2013 see Buy Cleveland-Cliffs Now for a more complete perspective. Even so, investors might benefit from a refresher on past performance. In downturns, Cleveland-Cliffs can suffer significantly \u2013 there is evidence as recent as 2022 that the stock lost up to 60% of its value in just a few quarters. Naturally, individual stocks are more volatile than diversified portfolios \u2013 and in this environment, if you are looking for upside with less volatility than that of a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns greater than 91% since its inception. Once again, although Cleveland-Cliffs is touting its $1.5 billion stock buyback program, potential improvements in steel demand, and the benefit of tariffs on imported steel for domestic producers, there is also a considerable risk to the U.S. economy that must be considered at this time. What is that? While inflation fears have lessened, they have not disappeared. In fact, Trump\u2019s assertive actions on tariffs and immigration have raised concerns that inflation could return. This scenario suggests that the U.S. economy might face serious challenges, or even a recession \u2013 as discussed in our analysis on the macro picture. When you also factor in the increased geopolitical uncertainty from bold policies by the new Trump administration, these risks become even more critical. With the Ukraine-Russia conflict still in progress, unpredictable trade conditions, and long-term allies such as Canada, Mexico, and Europe being called to the negotiating table, the stakes are high. CLF stock has fared much worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. Although investors are hoping for a soft landing for the U.S. economy, how severe could another recession be? Our dashboard, How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash, illustrates how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes. Inflation Shock (2022) \u2022 CLF stock fell 64.1% from a high of $33.07 on 28 March 2022 to $11.87 on 3 November 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock is yet to recover to its pre-Crisis high  \u2022 The highest level reached since then was $22.83 on 3 April 2024, and it is currently trading at around $10 per share Covid Pandemic (2020) \u2022 CLF stock fell 59.6% from a high of $7.60 on 19 February 2020 to $3.07 on 23 March 2020, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 7 October 2020 Global Financial Crisis (2008) \u2022 CLF stock fell 89.9% from a high of $119.19 on 30 June 2008 to $12.01 on 2 March 2009, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock is yet to recover to its pre-Crisis high In summary, although Cleveland-Cliffs stock is currently relatively inexpensive \u2013 trading at only about 0.26x last year\u2019s sales \u2013 its revenues declined last year, and consensus estimates suggest growth of only about 7% this year. Therefore, while the recently imposed tariffs should benefit Cleveland-Cliffs, ask yourself: if you plan to hold onto your Cleveland-Cliffs stock, would you panic and sell if it begins to drop to $8, $5, or even lower levels? Holding on to a falling stock is not always easy. Trefis partners with Empirical Asset Management \u2013 a Boston-area wealth manager whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns during the 2008\/2009 period, when the S&P lost more than 40%.Empirical has integrated the Cleveland-Cliffs revenues into its asset allocation framework to provide clients with improved returns and reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; a less volatile ride, as shown by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Industry watchers have, in the main, praised PepsiCo\u2019s near-$2bn move for US prebiotic soda business Poppi. If anyone needed convincing that, in the US at least, \u2018better-for-you\u2019 soda isn\u2019t a flash in the pan, perhaps PepsiCo\u2019s latest acquisition will have persuaded them. On Monday (17 March), just under 72 hours after Bloomberg reported PepsiCo was in late-stage talks to buy US prebiotic soda business Poppi, the US food and drinks giant announced a deal worth just under $2bn.                          The gold standard of business intelligence.                                                   Find out more                                  Poppi, formerly known as Mother Beverage, was set up in 2015 and, after receiving funding on US business pitch TV show Shark Tank three years later, relaunched under its current brand in 2020. Since then, Poppi, co-founded by Allison Ellsworth and her husband Stephen, has built what has become one of the more recognisable names in the growing market for \u2018better-for-you\u2019 sodas in the US. Robert Moskow, a beverage-industry analyst at US investment bank TD Cowen, says Poppi generated sales of just over $391m in tracked channels in the last 52 weeks. A company spokesperson says Poppi ran up annual sales of \u201cnorth of $500m\u201d in 2024. Alongside Olipop, Poppi, with its low-calorie and low-sugar sodas in 15 flavours, has become a brand synonymous with \u2018healthier\u2019 soda in the US. The purchase of Poppi is PepsiCo\u2019s second $1bn-plus acquisition in six months and the food-and-drinks major\u2019s latest attempt to tap into a growing part of the market through M&A. Speaking at the annual CAGNY investment conference last month, PepsiCo chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta called out \u201cfunctionality\u201d and \u201cmulticultural\u201d as two product trends that would be central to the company\u2019s investment strategy \u2013 and its recent deal-making underlines that thesis. In October, the Lay\u2019s snacks maker agreed to buy Mexican-American snacks maker Siete Foods for a fee of $1.2bn. \u201cMore than ever, consumers are looking for convenient and great-tasting options that fit their lifestyles and respond to their growing interest in health and wellness,\u201d Laguarta said on Monday. \u201cPoppi is a great complement to our portfolio transformation efforts to meet these needs.\u201d After attending last week\u2019s Expo West trade show in California, Moskow highlighted better-for-you soda as an area the major players in conventional fizzy drinks needed to focus on. \u201cWe believe carbonated soda leaders will need to take this segment of the market more seriously in 2025 rather than assuming it is a fad,\u201d Moskow said at the time and, this week, he praised PepsiCo\u2019s move. \u201cWe believe \u2018functional soda\u2019 is becoming a mainstream segment of the market with sustainable appeal,\u201d he said on Monday. The transaction includes $300m of anticipated cash tax benefits for a net purchase price of $1.65bn, PepsiCo said. The deal also features an additional potential \u201cearnout consideration\u201d based on whether certain undisclosed \u201cperformance milestones\u201d are reached, the company added. Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman says the price tag works out at around four times Poppi\u2019s sales in the last 12 months, which, she says, \u201cstrikes us as more akin to a beauty valuation\u201d. However, Lieberman adds: \u201cWe see a lot of similarities between the fast-growth, emerging brand landscape of each industry. Poppi boasts both scale and credibility with consumers (the latter of which really coming to light in our data work), which screens particularly attractive, in our view, when considering the path for an internal build would be long and uncertain.\u201d Not all consumers have been happy, however. Poppi confirmed this week it had settled\u00a0a lawsuit in the US filed by consumers who claimed they were misled by the company (Poppi said it \u201cacknowledges no fault, liability, or wrongdoing\u201d). The settlement will allow Poppi and PepsiCo to look forward. For PepsiCo, it\u2019s a chance to buy into a burgeoning market and attempt to grow the brand further. The company had planned to launch a similar soda under its Soulboost brand (which hit the market four years ago with a range of sparkling waters including \u201cfunctional\u201d ingredients like L-theanine and panax ginseng) but decided against the move (it\u2019s said the early indications for the new product were not positive) and pounced for Poppi instead. \u201cA frequent strategic dilemma when entering a new segment or category is whether to build or buy your way in,\u201d David Clark, a former General Mills executive and founder of the Avenir Strategies consultancy, says. \u201cBuying typically involves paying a premium based on anticipated growth derived from past performance \u2013 the more solid the track record, the higher the premium. Building avoids this purchase premium but has a slow build and a high failure rate, circa 80%.\u201d Last month, Coca-Cola\u00a0introduced\u00a0its first prebiotic soda line, launching the Simply Pop brand in the US. Simply Pop, initially set to go on sale \u201cat retail in select regions\u201d and via Amazon, is targeted at a product set that includes brands such as Poppi and Olipop. \u201cOf course, Coke may also be pursuing acquisitions \u2026 but these initial moves suggest that Coke and Pepsi may see the BFY soda opportunity and urgency differently. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how this unfolds,\u201d Clark says. Last month, Olipop was\u00a0valued at $1.85bn\u00a0after raising $50m in a Series C funding round, led by JP Morgan Private Capital\u2019s Growth Equity Partners. In 2023,\u00a0CNBC\u00a0quoted Ben Goodwin, Olipop\u2019s CEO, as saying PepsiCo and Coca-Cola had made an approach about a potential sale. Olipop said the new cash injection marked its \u201cfinal anticipated round of equity financing\u201d, after becoming profitable \u201cin early 2024\u201d. The company, however, also confirmed that it fell short of its $500m sales target projected in May, generating over $400m in revenue for fiscal year 2024. \u201cThe other big player in this space is Olipop and we fully expect them to get acquired by one of PepsiCo\u2019s rivals in the near term,\u201d Richard Wyborn, a partner at UK-based consultancy Food Strategy Associates, says. \u201cInterest in prebiotics and gut health isn\u2019t going anywhere and is a trend we expect to appear in more and more categories in the future.\u201d In the main, PepsiCo\u2019s acquisition of Poppi is seen by industry watchers as a deal that could benefit both sides. PepsiCo has snapped up a significant player in a buoyant product segment \u2013 and a segment that\u2019s expected to continue to grow. Meanwhile, Poppi gets the benefit of PepsiCo\u2019s distribution muscle. It wouldn\u2019t be a massive surprise if we saw, perhaps with some tweaks to recipes and flavours, Poppi products in more international markets in the months ahead. \u201cThey need to ensure they let management continue to do what they\u2019ve been doing \u2013 if it ain\u2019t broke don\u2019t fix it \u2013 but also ensure that they don\u2019t turbo charge the growth too much,\u201d Wyborn says. \u201cDistribution should be built up gradually all the while ensuring velocities remain high.\u201d However, not everyone is sold on the prospects for such functional sodas. PepsiCo\u2019s scale will undoubtedly help Poppi in the medium term and this type of bolt-on acquisition has delivered the best ROI in the FMCG industry. However, I remain sceptical about the long-term viability of these sodas,\u201d Ivan Torossian, a consulting director at GlobalData, Just Drinks\u2019 parent, says. \u201cAt $2.5\u2013$3 per can, Poppi lacks the \u2018instant gratification\u2019 factor. Red Bull gives you instant wings and electrolyte beverages instant hydration but prebiotics? Consumers too concerned with sugar and gut might as well stick to water for a quarter of the cost.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"New stats reveal smartwatch sales declined last year, but Apple particularly hit an all-time low.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Smartwatches are gracing almost every other person's wrist these days\u2014precisely 454.69 million people worldwide own one of these wearables that track everything from your steps to sleep quality and even your mental health. That said, even while so many of us have this health tracker strapped onto our hands, in 2024, smartwatch sales fell by 7% for the first time, according to Counterpoint Research\u2019s latest report. This downward trend can mostly be attributed to the decline in Apple Watch sales throughout the year. Even though Apple is still at the top of the table, it saw the highest decline percentage in sales of 19%. Counterpoint Research claims that this could be due to several reasons, including people opting out of an upgrade due to a lack of new features or design. The research firm also says it could be because their first-time experience with the watch didn't go as planned.  On the flip side, Wear OS-powered watches and those running proprietary OSes scored some brownie points from customers as smartwatch sales saw a steady uptick this past year despite an overall slump across the globe. Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Huawei saw exponential growth, especially the former making its way to the top five this year. Xiaomi also became the fastest-growing brand, seeing a 135% rise in sales, thanks to the Watch S1 and Redmi Watch series. It began selling new Wear OS models, such as the Xiaomi Watch 2 Pro, in the 4th quarter of 2023, which likely contributed to this massive growth in 2024. Huawei scored second, seeing a 35% increase in sales, although it notably does not sell Wear OS watches. Samsung placed third overall and also witnessed a 3% growth, thanks to the Galaxy Watch 7, Galaxy Watch Ultra, and Galaxy Watch FE Series, as seen in the infographic above.  Ten years ago, Apple released its first-ever Apple Watch Series, which was initially seen as a fashion accessory. That slowly took a turn to become the multi-faceted fitness tracker it is today. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android According to data from Demandsage (a research firm), Apple rules 21% of the global smartwatch market, but the recent decline in sales for the first time points to evolving customer preferences, increased competition from other brands, and a slowing upgrade cycle. \"Apple\u2019s steep decline was a result of the combination of Apple's infringement lawsuit against Masimo, increasing market competition, less significant upgrades in Watch Series 10, and the absence of Watch Ultra 3,\" Counterpoint's Senior Research Analyst Anshika Jain told Android Central in an email. The absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases  Much like its iPhones today, Apple has stuck to the same Watch design for years. The first significant change showed up on the Apple Watch 4, which brought about larger screens and a more defined casing while maintaining the same rounded rectangular dial. Later the Series 7 brought with it thinner bezels, and even more larger screens. Cut to the Series 8, where Apple decided to give its watches a more rugged look and launched the Ultra (a sight for sore eyes). Don't get me wrong, Apple has brought several advancements in tech, sensors, and processors over the years. But its overall \"look\" at first glance remained the same. According to Gemini's AI Overviews, \"people generally upgrade their Apple Watches every 2-3 years.\" Or when they notice significant performance issues or a life-altering feature, they'd want to ditch a year-old watch for a new one. For instance, I currently own an Apple Watch Series 8, which was a replacement and not a planned upgrade. My Series 6 stopped working after water damage while swimming, which made it practically unusable. The Series 8 brought with it features that track women's health better, and for someone with a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, owning a watch that predicts ovulation cycles was a neat feature to have, and I continue to use it to date. Jain also agrees that \"the absence of the Ultra 3 and minimal feature upgrades in the S10 lineup led consumers to hold back purchases,\" especially in North America\u2014 which was the biggest driver of this decline in sales for Apple.  Wear OS is the only real alternative if you want app support and rich notifications While it would be unfair to pit Apple against the broader variety of Wear OS watches, due to the sheer number of manufacturers involved. However, as much as it isn't fair, Wear OS has become the undeniable alternative for many, sporting a ton of options, has seamlessly integrated into the Android ecosystem without people needing to change devices, and does almost everything that an Apple Watch could do. Android Central's senior editor, Nick Sutrich, who uses a OnePlus Watch 3, highlights the same. Switching between the Pixel Watch 3 and the OnePlus Watch 3, Sutrich says that he has two main reasons why the Apple Watch just isn't for him. One, it's incompatibility with Android, and two, he hates the shape they come in. \"Wear OS is the only real alternative if you want app support and rich notifications,\" Sutrich said. \"I'd say I don't have a perfect choice at the moment. I prefer the Pixel Watch's size but like the OnePlus Watch 3's design and its battery life,\" Sutrich explained, demonstrating the flexibility that Wear OS watches bring, allowing users to pick between features that matter the most to them.  Beyond that, Wear OS, much like Android, is an open ecosystem that allows more freedom in terms of app availability and customization; for instance, Wear OS users can even create their own watch faces using the Watch Face Format available to those with a developer account. This freedom of personalizing your wearable without worrying about the phone's compatibility appeals to several people who choose to use a Samsung or a Pixel smartwatch over an Apple. Furthermore, the affordability and hardware variety of Wear OS also drives people to reach for them. The recent decision of OEMs like OnePlus, Xiaomi, and OPPO to join the Wear OS family, which was mostly dominated by Samsung and Google, has not only resulted in a diverse range of watch designs and styles to pick from but has also made smartwatches much more accessible for those on a tight budget. This might've potentially impacted Apple's sales as well, according to Jain. \"Huawei\u2019s comeback with Harmony OS, the rise of Chinese brands like Xiaomi and Honor, and the adoption of Samsung\u2019s newly launched Galaxy Watch 7, Galaxy Watch Ultra, and Galaxy Watch FE series intensified competition for Apple in 2024,\" she added. While the overall smartwatch sales did see a dip globally, this could also be attributed to several people wanting to move away from smartwatches for a much smaller fitness tracker like the smart ring. For instance, Android Central's EIC, Shruti Shekar, says she never really cared for watches; after using the Apple Watch 5\u2014which negatively impacted her mental wellbeing, she decided to get an Oura Ring. \"I took on the ring and found myself loving it so much more than the watch,\" she explained. \"I found the passive health nature of the Oura Ring a lot more up my alley than a watch.\" That said, the future of Apple and Wear OS watches seems promising as both brands are working on bringing advanced health-tracking features. For instance, the Apple Watch Series 11 is rumored to have blood glucose tracking and satellite messaging features in the next Watch Ultra, which could turn the tide in their direction, according to Jain.  \"Apple is expected to recover in 2025 with a low single-digit YoY shipment growth.\" \"This is based on the expectations of the introduction of a satellite messaging feature in Apple\u2019s Watch Ultra 3 in 2025 and the anticipated launch of the Watch SE 3 with an upgraded design.\" Jain also points out that with the rising adoption of Wear OS, we could expect advanced health monitoring features, improved battery life, and greater emphasis on personalization and customization. For instance, the next Pixel Watch could see a \"rounded-edge bezel turned into a squeezable, touch-sensitive control interface,\" along with a smartwatch \"Fit Score\" that informs the user of the\"differences in wrist size, skin color, hair density, BMI, fat percentage, and the likes.\" Integrating AI into their products could also push sales in the right direction. With more comprehensive health-tracking analysis combined with powerful hardware, like \"health sensors for measuring bodily signals such as serious heart health tracking, focusing on atrial fibrillation, sleep apnea, hypertension, and diabetes to sustain their position in the market,\" Jain explained.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"The ugly and embattled Cybetruck took another blow this week after the federal regulators issued a recall. According to the recall, Tesla must take back the vehicles to repair a bit of the trim that can fly loose while driving \u201cincreasing the risk of a crash.\u201d The recall affects more than 46,000 vehicles. Despite claims from Elon Musk that the Cybetruck is a bulletproof beast, it\u2019s actually a shoddily manufactured vehicle. Drivers and people who test the durability of cars have known this for a long time. This recall, which covers every single Cybetruck since it went on sale, is the 8th one for the vehicle. It\u2019s the second time the Cybertruck has been recalled over a trim issue. In June last year, the company issued a similar recall because \u201cthe trunk bed trim sail applique could have been improperly adhered and can loosen.\u201d Tesla told Bloomberg that it believes only 1% percent of the recalled Cybertrucks will have the issue, but it\u2019s calling all the vehicles back anyway and will foot the bill for a fix. It also said that it had not fixed the problem in the manufacturing process, but expected to roll it out around March 21. It said it had already received 151 warranty claims about the trim issue. The reason the trim sucks and is prone to flying away from the Cybertruck is that it\u2019s just glued on. In a video published in August 2024, YouTuber WhistlinDiesel put the Cybetruck through various durability tests and compared it to the more popular F-150. In the video WhistlinDiesel appears shocked when he\u2019s able to peel away various parts of the trim from the Cybertruck using just his hands. I\u2019m choosing cybertruck every time here \ud83d\udc80  \u266c original sound \u2013 Whistlindiesel    The clip of the trim being peeled away got a second life when WhistlinDiesel took to TikTok. A cut from the longer video has been viewed more than 20 million times online. In it, WhistlinDiesel slams the Cybertruck with a pickaxe before attempting to peel away pieces of the trim with the tool. He drops it because he doesn\u2019t need it. He only needs to use his hands to disassemble the car and you can see it\u2019s held together with glue. \u201cThat is not acceptable dude. You just glued your truck together. That\u2019s not OK. That is not OK,\u201d he said in the video. The high-profile recall of the Cybetruck is another blow to Tesla. Its stock price plummets every day. There are protests at the Tesla showrooms around the country. People are setting the cars on fire and spray painting swastikas on them. Long-time Tesla owners are selling the cars in massive numbers. The cost to insure the vehicles is skyrocketing. Major Tesla investor Ross Gerber has made multiple television appearances in the past few days calling on Musk to step down as CEO. \u201cIf Elon came back to Tesla, that would be great. That\u2019s exactly what Tesla needs. But he\u2019s not. And he\u2019s gonna stay at DOGE and he\u2019s one of the most powerful people in the world now it\u2019s definitely gotten to his head and I just don\u2019t see him changing and going back. I actually think he\u2019s completely neglecting Tesla at this point,\u201d Gerber told Bloomberg TV. \u201cI think Elon should appoint a new CEO to run Tesla so he can focus on what he\u2019s doing in the government and also separate himself from Tesla,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhich is the great company that\u2019s trying to solve climate change. It\u2019s now associated with Elon in such a negative fashion that it\u2019s destroying the sales of their main product, which is selling EVs. Somethings gotta change and I think it\u2019s gonna happen this year.\u201d Musk has attempted to use his connection to the White House to bolster sales and repair Tesla\u2019s image. It hasn\u2019t worked. Trump recorded what amounts to an ad for the vehicles on the South Lawn of the White House. The stock went down. On March 19, Treasury Secretary Howard Lutnick went on Fox News and pushed people to buy the stock. \u201cI think, if you want to learn something on this show tonight, buy Tesla,\u201d Lutnick said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that this guy\u2019s stock is this cheap. It\u2019ll never be this cheap again.\u201d The stock got cheaper on Thursday morning after his appearance.  cybertruckElon MuskTESLA  \r           Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r          \r           News from the future, delivered to your present.\r          \r       Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r                 The CDC is set to cut a third of its contracts spending within the next two weeks\u2014the latest bit of dismantling orchestrated by the Trump administration.                     \"Elon Musk should become Donald Trump's special envoy for midterm elections,\" said one Democratic Party leader.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Business Insider Edition  JD Vance sold his home just outside Washington, DC, for $1.87 million after less than three weeks on the market, according to property records.          The buyer is a former deputy director under Trump's first administration who now works as a government contractor \u2014 and paid $172,000 over asking price.               Christopher Garcia manages a domestic limited liability company registered in Nevada that purchased Vance's home in Alexandria, Virginia, a Washington, DC, suburb about eight miles from the nation's capital.               Garcia was the national deputy director of the US Department of Commerce from 2017 to 2018, according to his LinkedIn profile.               Garcia \u2014 who still owns other property in Washington, DC, records show \u2014 is currently listed as president and CEO of Health Supply US, a government-contracted manufacturer and distributor of medical devices, personal protective equipment, and consumables.               According to government spending data, Health Supply US received nearly $179 million in government contracts between 2020 and 2021.               A spokesperson for Garcia confirmed to Forbes that Garcia was behind the purchase and that the sale price was based on the market. The spokesperson also told Forbes that Garcia and the seller had no relationship and no direct communication. Garcia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.               Vance and his wife, Usha, bought the Alexandria house in 2023 for $1.64 million.               The couple made $228,025 more than they paid on the sale, but it's unclear whether they spent any money on renovations or upgrades that would cut into their profit.               The five-bedroom, three-and-a-half bathroom, farmhouse-style home hit the market on February 27 listed at $1.69 million, according to its Redfin listing. The sale officially closed on March 17, just 18 days later.               Real-estate agent Justin Tanner of ReMax Allegiance, who represented the buyer, told Business Insider that he heard there were nine offers on the home.               Robert Crawford and Tyler Jeffrey of TTR Sotheby's International Realty listed the property. Crawford and Jeffrey did not respond to a request for comment.               Vance will spend most of his time in the official home of the vice president, which is on the grounds of the Naval Observatory.               Property records show, however, that Vance still owns a home in Washington, DC. In 2014, Vance and his wife purchased a DC townhome for $590,000 in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, within walking distance of the National Mall.               According to Redfin, the house was listed for rent in October 2023 for $3,700 a month.               In 2024, the Vances' renter at the time told the Washington Post that she planned to stay there for a while and that her landlords were responsive.               \"I love this house. I love this block. I want to be here for a long time,\" she said. \"So I want to be a good tenant.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  EBAY Stock Question: How would you feel if your eBay stock (NASDAQ: EBAY) fell by 75% in the next few months? Although this scenario might seem extreme, historical evidence shows that such dramatic declines can occur.   Let's review the current situation: Year-to-date, eBay has outperformed the S&P 500, with a 9% gain versus the S&P 500's 4% decline. This superior performance is partly due to increased investor optimism following Meta's announcement that certain eBay listings would appear on Facebook Marketplace, potentially reinforcing eBay's competitive position. However, broader market concerns regarding a potential U.S. recession, driven by factors such as tariffs, are prompting a widespread sell-off. This market volatility raises concerns about eBay's future performance. eBay's stock has shown considerable vulnerability during economic downturns. In 2022, it declined by 45% over a few quarters, and during the 2008 recession, it plummeted by an astonishing 75%. Currently, eBay is trading at $68, close to its 52\u2010week high of $71. Given this historical volatility, a significant market downturn could potentially push the stock price below $20. Clearly, individual stocks tend to be more volatile than diversified portfolios \u2013 so if you seek growth with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Although eBay shows promising potential with its listings appearing on Facebook, investors should consider broader economic risks in their evaluation. As an online retail platform, eBay is susceptible to declines in consumer spending. In fact, recent retail sales data reported a modest 0.2% increase for the month, recovering from the previous month\u2019s revised 1.2% decline, though this improvement fell short of the expected 0.6% growth. [1]  Even though inflation concerns have eased somewhat, they remain a significant factor. President Trump's assertive policies on tariffs and immigration have renewed worries about potential inflationary pressures. This uncertainty, combined with the U.S. economy's susceptibility to contraction, heightens the possibility of a recession. The global geopolitical landscape has become increasingly unstable, marked by the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, rising trade tensions, and deteriorating relationships with traditional allies such as Canada, Mexico, and European nations. After a period of relative calm following a January ceasefire, Israel has resumed its military operations in Gaza, with lethal strikes occurring on March 18th. These external factors add considerable risk to the market environment. See our analysis here on the macro picture. Given these complex dynamics, investors should vigilantly monitor macroeconomic indicators when assessing positions in eBay or similar investments. EBAY stock has experienced an impact that was slightly worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. Concerned about the effects of a market crash on EBAY stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash illustrates how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes. \u2022 EBAY stock dropped 44.9% from a high of $66.81 on 6 January 2022 to $36.81 on 2 October 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 8 October 2024  \u2022 Since then, the stock reached a high of $70.93 on 25 February 2025 and is currently trading at around $68  \u2022 EBAY stock declined 31.6% from a high of $38.49 on 4 March 2020 to $26.34 on 23 March 2020, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 24 April 2020  \u2022 EBAY stock declined 74.7% from a high of $15.21 on 17 October 2007 to $3.85 on 9 March 2009, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 19 April 2012 eBay\u2019s Revenues have declined at an average rate of 0.4% over the past three years, compared to a 6.3% increase for the S&P 500. Notably, the company\u2019s operating margin has dropped from 28.1% in 2021 to 22.5% in 2024. However, this does not appear to be reflected in the company\u2019s valuation, as EBAY stock is currently trading at 3.3x trailing revenues, representing a slight premium compared to its three-year average P\/S ratio of 2.5x. Considering the likelihood of a slowdown in growth and broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself this question: Do you plan to hold onto your EBAY stock now, or will you panic and sell if it begins to fall to $40, $20, or even lower levels? Holding onto a declining stock is never easy.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Business Insider Edition  Fawn Weaver has never been able to run her business without worrying about tariffs. She launched her Tennessee whiskey brand, Uncle Nearest, in 2017, right before the European Union slapped tariffs on American whiskeys and bourbons as part of a back-and-forth trade war with Donald Trump in 2018. That means Weaver's international sales strategy has been affected, basically, since \"day one,\" she says. And because Uncle Nearest was a new kid on the block, the company didn't really have much wiggle room on prices.          \"We couldn't pass on those tariffs to the consumer,\" she says. \"We had to absorb them, and there was absolutely no way we could absorb them.\"               When Europe suspended whiskey tariffs in 2021, Weaver wasn't home-free, either. She knew the suspension might not be permanent, especially if Trump landed back in the White House. So when he won in November, Uncle Nearest pulled international sales from their annual earnings forecast in anticipation of a return to the trade war.               \"We had to make a decision to not focus as much on international until the trade war was over,\" she says. \"Well, it's not been over.\"               And return the trade war has: The EU is threatening to implement a 50% tariff on American whiskeys. And now, there's a new and surprising trade foe: Canada. The United States' neighbors to the north aren't putting tariffs on US-made bourbon in response to Trump's various economic threats; they're simply making it impossible to buy.               \"They pulled us off the shelf right along with Jack Daniels,\" Weaver says.               The reignition of the international brown liquor battle is another headache for an industry already reeling. After multiple years of solid growth in the 2010s and a pandemic-driven boom in 2020, domestic US whiskey sales have been on the decline, while international sales have flattened. Data from IWSR, an analytics firm focused on the alcohol industry, found that sales volume of US whiskeys fell by 1.2% in 2023, and another 2% in 2024. Globally, sales were flat in 2023 and are on track to decline in 2024. (American whiskeys include bourbon, Tennessee, and rye. The distinctions are key since all bourbons are whiskeys, but not all whiskeys are bourbon. If it's American or Irish, it's whiskey, with the \"e.\" If it's from Scotland, England, Japan, or most other places, it's spelled whisky.)               For customers, this could mean some of their favorite craft brands might struggle and even fold if they can't get on enough shelves in America or abroad. Ironically, though, the bourbon industry's tariff-related headaches may wind up being a plus for American drinkers in the near term \u2014 distilleries could wind up with a ton of inventory they can't sell overseas and push more volumes and varieties onto the US market. That could mean prices on American booze come down in the near term, though some analysts say distributors could just charge more on everything, wherever it's made.               There's no denying the industry is facing troubles, but Weaver chafes at the idea of calling what's happening a bourbon \"bust.\" Uncle Nearest is growing as a brand, and there are still plenty of whiskey drinkers out there, at home and abroad. Instead, what's happening is more of a normalization, and one she thinks more people should have seen coming.               \"Everyone was so caught up in this 'boom,' no one was forecasting for the correction,\" she says. Whatever the case, Trump's latest moves are a sobering moment for an industry that can no longer deny its growing pains.               The modern whiskey trend in America dates back to the \"Mad Men\" era of the 1950s and '60s, explained Marten Lodewijks, the president of IWSR US. Its popularity started tapering off in the '70s \u2014 people tend not to want to drink what their parents drank. In the '80s and '90s, whiskey really struggled, which was a curse and a blessing, because it got to sit and age until it picked up in popularity once again in the 2000s, around when the show \"Mad Men\" came out.               \"Those were sort of the glory days for Scotch whisky,\" Lodewijks said. \"The bourbon industry was a little bit later to the party, but obviously they weren't blind to what was happening. And so they rose with the tide as well.\"               Over the past decade or so, bourbon has really taken off, too. Much like Scotch, bourbon makers have focused on premiumization \u2014 improving the quality and raising the price point. Where it was once seen as a product for drunks, it's now considered fancy. Because bourbon ages for less time than Scotch and has laxer rules around it in areas such as ingredients, distillers can be more dynamic in their approach, too. \"You can sort of take more chances,\" Lodewijks said. \"You don't have to wait 12 years to figure out whether or not your innovation is a complete miss or a potential success.\"               Per the Kentucky Distillers' Association, an industry group, Kentucky produced 3.2 million barrels of whiskey in 2024 and has a record 14.3 million barrels aging. Multiple new producers and brands have popped up, bourbon collecting has risen in popularity, and some consumers have been willing and able to spend big on high-end bottles.               The COVID-19 pandemic put these trends on overdrive. People were sitting at home bored with money to spend, and they were spending more of it on alcohol.               \"There was a massive runup during COVID,\" said Tzvi Wiesel, a longtime whiskey investor and trader and the CEO of Baxus, a spirits trading platform. \"So all of these distilleries and investors and everyone got a little bit ahead of themselves, and they're like, 'Oh, there's going to be this level of demand and growth is going to continue forever.'\"               Private investors got in on the action, pouring money into distilleries and upping production. \"They built the capacity to make a million new barrels a year,\" Wiesel said. The problem was, there wasn't actually a sustainable place for that demand and growth.               The influx of money chasing the increased demand led to what's become a market flush with product that has nowhere to go.               \"The hedge funds and the private equity players, they've gone out and bought barrels, but they don't have a brand to go along with it,\" said Trey Zoeller, the founder and chief strategist at Jefferson's Bourbon. \"When bourbon was very scarce, that might've been a good investment. Now, there's not nearly as many buyers for that as there were when there's such scarcity.\"               Despite hopes for a new normal, bourbon has long been a cyclical industry. Optimists expected the upward trajectory kicked off by the pandemic to continue, but the market's come back down to earth.               On the one hand, demand is clearly decelerating. By 2022, Americans had returned to their normal drinking habits \u2014 when you're back in the office, pouring an old-fashioned at 2 in the afternoon is a real no-no. Amid inflation and dwindling pandemic-driven savings, there's also been a squeeze on consumers' wallets. Alcohol is a discretionary item, meaning it's a want, not a need, and when budgets are tight, people tend to lay off. There are structural factors in play as well. Gen Z is drinking less. Cannabis may be taking some market share from booze. GLP-1s such as Ozempic appear to curb alcohol cravings. Those are \"probably having an impact on the margins,\" said Nadine Sarwat, an analyst who covers the beverage and cannabis industries at Bernstein, though it's not clear they're huge factors \u2014 most 24-year-olds (of any generation) are not high-end whiskey drinkers.               On the supply side, the decline in consumer interest is happening at a time when there's a glut of whiskey available. Because bourbon has to age for at least a couple of years \u2014 most are kept for four to six years \u2014 producers have to anticipate demand years in advance. It's become increasingly clear that a lot of producers overshot their estimates. There's a ton of bourbon sitting in barrels with no bottles to pour it into or brands that want to buy it. (Some brands distill their own whiskeys; some buy it from larger distilleries on contract; some do both and even blend different barrels together.) While distillers can sit on barrels for a while, there are limits, depending on the product. Most bourbon has about a 10-year age limit before it turns. Many investors are on a tighter timeline ito get their returns, meaning they have to cut prices on barrels to move them on the market.               \"What I was paying for four-year-old Kentucky bourbon three years ago, I can now get 10-year-old Kentucky bourbon cheaper,\" said Blake Riber, who runs the craft spirits platform Seelbach's and blogs about the whiskey industry at Bourbonr. \"This is just wild, the pricing on it and how much that has just crashed in, call it, 12 months.\"               Some producers have started to recognize the writing on the wall and scaled back, such as the distilled spirits maker MGP and the alcohol conglomerates Diageo and Brown-Forman.               \"The challenge that they're all going to be facing over the next few years is, what do I do with all of the extra liquid in order to either let it age more or are there other outlets that I can use?\" Lodewijks said. That may mean more flavored whiskeys or more whiskey-based ready-to-drink cocktails \u2014 whatever gets it poured before it goes bad.               The tariffs, of course, are throwing a wrench in an already difficult situation. As part of Trump's trade war, the EU is mulling ending the suspension of its tariffs on American whiskeys \u2014 it was on track to do so on April 1, though it's since decided to delay that until the middle of the month. And this time, the bloc could set the levies at 50%, double the 25% from the president's first term. Trump, in turn, has threatened a 200% tariff on wines, Champagnes, and other alcoholic products out of France and the rest of Europe.               It's not entirely clear what it would mean for the American bourbon industry if the EU tariffs take effect. Given the recent glut and change in domestic appetites, growing sales outside America has been a key release valve for producers. Bernstein's Sarwat estimates that tariffs would result in a 10% hit to operating income for Brown-Forman, which owns brands such as Jack Daniel's and Woodford Reserve.               \"Because US volumes have been really sluggish over the last couple of years, the international market has always been a real positive for increased penetration, and so any further challenges in that market does not help,\" she said.               Lodewijks said the EU's original 25% tariff led to about a 20% decline in whiskey sales to Europe, but that doesn't necessarily mean we know what a 50% tariff would do. \"There's a point at which more and more consumers aren't willing to spend or spend the money that it would take to buy the product. So I'm not saying necessarily it'll be more than 40%, but likely, it would be more,\" he said.               The broad point of Trump's trade war \u2014 with Europe, China, whoever \u2014 is ostensibly to encourage companies to make more goods in the US. But in spaces such as alcohol, it's not so simple. Tequila has to come from Mexico. Scotch is always from Scotland. American whiskey companies would love to sell more to people at home, but American drinkers are not picking up what they're putting down. If tariffs go into effect on alcohol products coming into the US, people won't necessarily switch over to domestically made bourbon. If you're predominantly a wine drinker, you may not be jonesing to swap that for Wild Turkey overnight. And for the industry and Americans who do drink brown liquor, the tit-for-tat battle may not be a win either.               Last time around, American bourbon and whiskey companies ate a lot of the cost of tariffs instead of increasing prices. But not everyone in the space has such a luxury, especially the smaller guys who've already been pushed around by the bigger guys. They're trying to fight for shelf space wherever they can get it and are still trying to recover from the 2018 tariff bout.               \"After the tariffs, everything fell off a cliff, and it has not recovered at all,\" said Becky Harris, the former president of the American Craft Spirits Association and the founder of Catoctin Creek distillery. \"The big producers do recover. They recover why? Because they have massive amounts of money, they can splash back into the market.\"               That means some small producers may go under if they cannot find a place to sell their products. Given the industry's competitiveness, they could also try to increase prices, though that may be tough. The bigger manufacturers and distributors have broad portfolios of products that encompass different types of alcohol from different parts of the world. If they see a price increase on imports to the US for one of their product lines, say, a European wine or Mexican tequila, they may increase prices on American-made products, too, either because they have to or just because they can.               \"It's very likely that under the cover of tariffs, domestic products will also go up in price,\" Lodewijks said.               While some analysts and industry professionals told me the supply glut could lead to producers dropping their prices in the short term in an attempt to move their booze, Tom Fischer, who runs BourbonBlog.com, said the long-term news may not be as encouraging.               \"If distilleries lose sales in Europe due to higher prices from EU tariffs, those same American distilleries may raise domestic prices to offset lost revenue,\" he said. \"This has been shown to happen in the past with other goods, so we hope that bourbon won't be the next casualty.\"               Trump's trade war has the potential to hit the industry in more tangential places, too. Riber noted that not much glass manufacturing happens in the US, and he's starting to hear concerns from bourbon brands about potential tariffs on glass imports and needing to raise prices to make up for it. \"At some point, that's going to have to get passed on,\" he said. Wiesel brought up the increased need for warehouse space as bourbon piles up that can't be sold. \"Distilleries are going to have to invest a ton into the actual physical infrastructure to hold onto all of these barrels that they own that are maturing for longer because they don't have a place to sell them,\" he said.               And then there's Canada, which the president has picked a somewhat confusing fight with. He's threatened 25% tariffs on imports from Canada, has said he wants to make it the 51st state, and has taken an overall aggressive approach to the country. It's sparked a sense of patriotism in Canada \u2014 along with boycotts on American-made products, including bourbon.               \"Canada is just pulling American products. They're essentially sending notes to their suppliers saying, 'Hey, no, I don't have anything against you, but my customers are not buying American right now. They're angry,'\" Harris said. \"And they said, 'Even when the tariffs are gone, this is going to take a while, so don't hold your breath.'\"               Fischer expressed similar concerns about the potential European tariffs. \"A 50% tariff risks pricing us out of key markets, and once those consumers shift, they may not come back,\" he said. \"You can't just roll back a tariff and expect loyalty to return overnight. This is long-term damage.\"               Weaver, from Uncle Nearest, is still optimistic about the future. Bourbon is one of America's most important exports \"in terms of symbolism,\" she said, and if you look at bourbon's history, \"we've always had these times when people are drinking less of it, but then it comes roaring back.\" She gets that the president is doing what he thinks he needs to do to negotiate trade agreements. In the meantime, it might be nice if he gave the industry a bit of a PR boost.               \"The best thing he could do is literally say, 'Hey, America, this is going to be in our best interest,' because this is clearly what he believes, 'but while we're working this out, we really need you to double down on bourbon,'\" she said.               Maybe \"Buy American\" can become \"Drink American,\" even if the president himself doesn't drink.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Is it a clamshell or is it a book-style? Huawei challenges you with a \"why not both\" scenario.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Huawei's latest phone launch is here and it's truly walking the line between foldable designs. The Chinese OEM debuted the Pura X foldable phone today (Mar. 20); however, the device seemingly teeters between clamshell and bookstyle foldable designs (via The Verge). When folded, the Pura X looks like your standard clamshell foldable; however, you'll note that the hinge is to the left, like a Galaxy Z Fold 6. On the front, the Pura X features a 3.5-inch OLED display with a max 120Hz refresh rate and a 1440 Hz high-frequency PWM dimming. Above that rounded corner square cover screen is the Pura X's triple camera array. The horizontal housing features a 50MP primary lens with f\/1.6 aperture and OIS (optical image stabilization). This is joined by a 40MP ultra-wide angled lens and an 8MP telephoto lens. Opening the Pura X is where things take a more book-style turn as Huawei provided it with an immersively wide 6.3-inch OLED display with a 16:10 aspect ratio. The company states it features 2,500nits of peak brightness and 1,440Hz PWM dimming. Huawei really doubles down on the width and broadness of this foldable's display, stating users can enjoy such a view in landscape or portrait mode. For viewing videos, Huawei says users can experience a \"broad field of vision\" when in landscape and even gaming. However, going vertical sees \"pictures and text displayed more widely with clear content.\"  The Pura X contains a wide variety of Huawei's AI and HarmonyOS software. The cover display features alternating \"intelligent lighting effects,\" the ability to turn photos into stickers on the lock screen, and cute\/interactive pets. Users can also use the camera in the phone's folded state for sharp selfies and more. Huawei also added its in-house AI assistant, Pangu, via Harmony Intelligence. As The Verge notes, this is the first of its phones to do so. Huawei's latest device boasts HarmonyOS Next (OS 5). One of the main highlights of this software is its notable lack of Android app support. The company discussed this new vision of its software in 2024, stating it would be built on its own custom architecture instead of the Android Open Source Project. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Internally, the Pura X steps up its cooling game with the \" ultra-cold three-dimensional cooling system.\" Huawei says this technology improves the phone's heat dissipation and efficiency. What's more, the foldable contains a 4,720mAh battery with 66W wired charging. Those purchasing it in China will find 12GB of RAM and the choice of 256GB and 512GB internal storage. Moreover, the Collector's Edition takes things up to 16\/512GB and 16\/1TB. The Huawei Pura X starts at 7,499 yuan (~$1,034) in Stylish Red, Stylish Green, Moon Shadow Gray, Zero White, and Phantom Night Black. For now, the phone remains restricted to the Chinese market.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"We need to change who owns capital. Private ownership of capital has created a lot of wealth and prosperity, and for much of the past centuries that has been a good thing, but now we need to create more owners of it. Not just the founders and executives and already rich, but everyone.  This is no longer Adam Smith\u2019s economy\u2014he could not have foreseen how wealth would consolidate into the hands of a few. Those rich enough from businesses, real estate, and investments were able to buy more businesses, real estate, and investments, until they owned most of the capital.  Today, the richest 10% of Americans own 92% of the stock market. That means when the economy does well, it benefits an increasingly few.  Our wealth imbalance has created a power imbalance. The world's wealthiest individuals have steadily claimed our companies, our media, our homes, our banks, our satellites, our technology, our governments. Wealth is cementing at these levels, with the already rich and powerful becoming even more so, and those not already wealthy unable to catch up or ever have a say again.  If we don\u2019t do something about it we could lose democracy. We already are.  We need to expand Adam Smith\u2019s model for future generations\u2014to create an elevated vision for capitalism in which everyone gets richer from capital, not just the few who got in decades ago. If we can shift our wealth imbalance, we can shift our power imbalance\u2014creating an economy owned and operated by us, and a democracy that better represents our interests. That\u2019s why I\u2019m devoting the next couple of years to studying capital and how we can create more owners of it. I\u2019m researching profit and how it can be owned by workers, invested in communities, and fund innovations that will benefit our future. I\u2019m studying government structures that incentivize pro-social businesses, invest in our long-term growth and prosperity, and protect and advance the future of democratic governance. I\u2019m writing a vision for an economy that creates a better future for all of us, not just a bunch of shareholders.  My goal is to create, not just a book, but a movement: We Should Own The Economy, a vision for the future of capitalism (and the world). Subscribe to follow my \u201cWe Should Own The Economy\u201d project \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffb I once wrote that I\u2019d rather have an investor than a publishing contract, that\u2019s still true. Instead of pitching this idea to publishing houses, securing a book advance, writing it in secret over the next several years, then hoping people read it when it comes out; I\u2019m pitching it to you. You can listen in on my interviews as I have them, read chapter drafts as I write them, contribute comments and help me crowdsource my research as I go, and even earn a share of the profits when it sells. In other words: I\u2019m giving you ownership in a book project about creating more owners. I'm currently raising a $50,000 book advance to fund my research over the next several years. Once I've finished the book, I'll use Flexile to host my cap table before I open book sales to the public. Fifty percent of book sales will cover costs associated with the project and 40% will be distributed among investors as an annual distribution. I will donate the remaining 10% as an annual donation to GiveDirectly. If the project goes on to sell to a traditional publisher or becomes an audiobook, podcast, or documentary, we will retain that same profit-sharing split. Invest in \"We Should Own The Economy\" I'm crowdfunding my book advance using WeFunder, a platform that allows businesses to crowdfund investment from supporters, and share profits with them. These are nonbinding reservations\u2014if I reach my $50,000 goal, supporters will be prompted to confirm their payment before I close the round. If I do not reach my goal, supporters will not be charged. This book advance will allow me to: Market and pre-sell 10,000 book copies by book launch ($10,000) Design, print, and ship physical books ($30,000) Sell an additional 10,000 copies in the six weeks after publication ($10,000) My goal is to pre-sell 10,000 copies before launch (10% of my projected subscriber base in January of 2028), and sell an additional 10,000 in the six weeks after publication through a coordinated marketing campaign and podcast circuit. Split between $20 ebooks and $30 print books, sales of 20,000 books would net $500,000 in revenue, with $200,000 going back to investors and $50,000 donated to GiveDirectly. If we reach our goals, that's a 4x return on your $50,000 investment! Invest in \"We Should Own The Economy\" This isn't just about selling books, it's about creating change. As stakeholders in this project, I'd love to invite you to participate in it: Reserve your signed, collector's edition copy of the book + comment and participate in the project live ($100 investment, includes one year as a paid subscriber to The Elysian) Receive my monthly \u201cbuild in public\u201d newsletter + provide feedback and get polling rights on the direction of the book ($200 investment, includes one year as a Founding subscriber of The Elysian) Join quarterly advisory board calls & help me brainstorm early content ideas ($500 investment) Write a \"brief\" on your company to share in roundup emails of supporters' projects ($1,000 investment) Speak on one of my \"Guest Lecture\" calls for subscribers ($3,000 investment, subject to author approval, limited availability) Reserve 50 copies of the book for your organization + get a custom webinar with me ($5,000 investment) Write an online article for my subscribers ($7,000 investment, subject to author approval, limited availability) Reserve 100 copies of the book for your organization + get a custom webinar with me ($10,000 investment) Write a two-page breakout for the book in your area of thought leadership ($15,000 investment, subject to author approval, limited availability) Collaborate on a deep-dive case study that will be printed as a separate booklet and included with the print book ($20,000 investment, subject to author approval, limited availability) Spend a week traveling on-location with me to study a pro-social organization ($30,000, limited availability) Write the foreword for the book + co-host, introduce, and speak at the book launch party ($50,000 investment, limit one) All content produced by funding partners will be noted both online and in print.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"ByCarrie McCabe  ByCarrie McCabe,  Contributor.  Financial Markets After two consecutive years of stock market returns exceeding 20 percent, many investors are contemplating pulling back their equity exposure amid political uncertainty, global tariffs, and broader economic concerns. The temptation to time the market\u2014to step aside until the volatility passes and re-enter at a more opportune moment\u2014can be strong. But history and data suggest that market timing is more likely to hurt than help. The best course of action? Stay invested, but stay smart. Market timing is appealing in theory but nearly impossible to execute successfully. Investors need to correctly predict not just when to exit the market, but also when to get back in. The odds of consistently nailing both decisions are slim to none. A compelling statistic from JPMorgan underscores this challenge: The S&P 500\u2019s average annualized return over the past 20 years was 10.2%. However, if an investor missed just the 10 best trading days over that period, their return would be nearly cut in half. In other words, the bulk of market gains occur in just a handful of trading days\u2014days that are nearly impossible to predict in advance. If market timing is a foolhardy mission, why should investors stay invested? Because at its core, the stock market is a long-term reflection of global economic progress. While short-term volatility is inevitable, over time economies tend to grow, innovation drives productivity, and corporate earnings rise. As Steven Pinker and other researchers have documented, global poverty has declined, life expectancy has increased, and health outcomes have improved. Despite periods of economic uncertainty, human progress has been remarkably consistent. This, in turn, fuels long-term equity returns. The stock market, in many ways, is a bet on continued economic progress\u2014and historically, that has been a winning wager. Of course, staying invested doesn\u2019t have to mean standing still. There is merit to strategic portfolio adjustments, particularly in response to valuation disparities across global markets. For instance, consider shifting some exposure out of the U.S. and into Europe. As of early 2025, the European equity market had a forward P\/E ratio of 13.84. In contrast, U.S. large-cap stocks had a forward P\/E of 21.49. Investors seeking diversification may benefit from increasing their allocation to European equities. One reason why, not surprisingly, year to date European equities are outperforming their U.S. counterparts. Every market cycle has its share of naysayers who believe the next major crash is imminent. And indeed, if we are on the verge of a 1929-style collapse, then none of these observations may apply. But history also suggests that betting on catastrophe is a losing strategy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, the S&P 500 plunged 34% in early 2020. Some investors panicked and sold their holdings, expecting further declines. But within months, the market had rebounded, ending the year with a 16% gain, before adding a further 25% in 2021. Those who stayed on the sidelines waiting for an all-clear signal missed out on the recovery The most successful investors aren\u2019t those who perfectly time the market, but those who stay committed to a long-term strategy while making prudent adjustments. We know that past does not foretell future market behavior, but we can be informed by history. For those still tempted to time the market, consider this: Wall Street\u2019s own track record of predicting short-term returns is dismal. Over the past 20 years, market strategists\u2019 annual return forecasts have had little correlation with actual performance. And truly, if the professionals can\u2019t get it right, why should individual investors expect to? So instead of trying to predict the next downturn, focus on what\u2019s within your control: diversification, preservation of appropriate liquidity, valuation-aware asset allocation, fee minimization, and the discipline to stay invested. History does inform\u2014market timing doesn\u2019t work, but patience and strategic investing do.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Business Insider Edition  Frank founder Charlie Javice kicked off her defense case with some firepower at her JPMorgan Chase fraud trial Thursday \u2014 calling private equity billionaire Marc Rowan to the witness stand.  The Apollo Global Management cofounder and CEO told a federal jury in Manhattan that he was an early investor and board member of Frank, explaining that he had been impressed with the student financial aid platform's prospects and with Javice's leadership.               \"Favorable,\" he said when asked for his first impression of the young entrepreneur, who was in her mid-20s when they met in 2017. \"She seemed to have an interesting take on how to tackle the market.\"               The two had been introduced through one of his colleagues, who, like Rowan and Javice, had attended the Wharton School, he said.               The Apollo CEO wore a black suit and white dress shirt \u2014 no tie \u2014 and sipped from a plastic water bottle as he spoke. He and Javice exchanged two-handed waves and broad smiles as he left the courtroom for Thursday's lunch break.               He told jurors he remained at arm's length from JPMorgan's $175 million acquisition of Frank, the 2021 merger at the center of the fraud trial.               Prosecutors say Javice and codefendant Olivier Amar used phony data to trick the bank into thinking the website had compiled the names, addresses, and other personal information for 4.25 million high school and college students \u2014 a valuable new market for the bank's checking accounts and credit cards.               Despite his distance from the merger, Rowan's testimony had a twofold use for the defense.               Jurors heard an influential CEO praise Javice as a young entrepreneur with the savvy to win a one-on-one meeting with Jamie Dimon. As CEO of JPMorgan, Dimon ran the country's largest bank.               \"She reported a very enthusiastic meeting with the CEO,\" Rowan said, remembering the 2021 conversation with a smile.               Rowan's testimony \u2014 under questioning by defense lawyer Christopher Tayback of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan \u2014 also had a tactical usefulness.               Javice's lawyers have argued that when she told JPMorgan that Frank had 4.25 million \"users,\" she was actually only counting website visitors, a number supported by Google analytics metrics.               \"A user could casually come and go and absorb Frank content without significant interaction,\" Rowan told the jury, saying there was little difference between words such as \"user,\" \"customer,\" and \"visitor.\"               Then came Rowan's cross-examination.               \"You said on direct that you understood 'user,' 'customer,' 'visitor,' and 'website user' to be synonymous?\" Assistant US Attorney Nicholas Chiuchiolo asked.               \"Yes,\" Rowan answered. \"I'm pretty used to those terms being used interchangeably.\"               \"Do you know how a 'Frank user' was described to Capital One?\" the prosecutor then asked, referring to another potential Frank purchaser.               \"No,\" Rowan answered.               \"Do you know how a 'Frank user' was described to JPMorgan Chase?\" the prosecutor asked, to which Rowan again answered, \"No.\"               As the cross-examination continued, Rowan said he did not know how many user names, phone numbers, and email addresses Frank actually possessed when the merger went through.               He also said he was unaware that Frank told JPMorgan that the website had what Chiuchiolo termed \"4.264 unique customer accounts.\"               \"You said that as a board member of a small company, you were a sounding board for Ms. Javice,\" the prosecutor said. \"Did you ever advise Ms. Javice to send JPMorgan a fake customer list made up of false data?\" he asked, repeating an allegation from the indictment.               \"No,\" Rowan answered.               \"Did you ever advise Ms. Javice to purchase a customer list on the open market and tell JPMorgan that they were Frank customers?\" the prosecutor then asked, as a final question.               \"No, I did not,\" Rowan answered.               The trial is off on Friday. Defense testimony for Javice, and then for Amar, is expected to continue next week, with closing arguments tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"ByBrendan Ahern  ByBrendan Ahern,  Senior Contributor.  CLN E-commerce company PDD Holdings (PDD US) reported Q4 results before the U.S. open. The company is not the most communicative, as the founder's engineering background means he focuses solely on the business. For instance, the company doesn\u2019t break out revenues from domestic China e-commerce from its Temu global e-commerce. The lack of communication has sometimes created volatility for shareholders. On today\u2019s analyst conference call, the company, when asked by an analyst about competition in e-commerce, noted that competition pushes the company to keep investing in technology. When asked indirectly about changing US import shipping laws, the company said that it could create \u201cchallenges\u201d though it was out of their control, so they will focus on improving their platform. After rising+29% YTD, the ADR is off slightly this morning following the report. Asian equities were largely higher, as Taiwan, Australia, India, and Indonesia all gained +1% while Hong Kong underperformed. The PBOC kept the 1 and 5-year Loan Prime Rates unchanged as expected, as they will likely cut when the U.S. Federal Reserve cuts rates. After rising more than 80% over the last year, Tencent\u2019s better-than-expected results led to profit taking in the stock and Hong Kong internet stocks that have also outperformed significantly over the last year, as Alibaba fell -3.97%, Xiaomi fell -2.92%, Meituan fell -4.43%, and Kuaishou fell -4.64%. There is some chatter about Tencent\u2019s 2025 buyback being smaller than 2024 and lighter capex, but it is likely just profit-taking, in my opinion. Insurance giant Ping An\u2019s Q4 missed analyst expectations, weighing on the market and insurance sub-sector as the stock fell -5.01% in Hong Kong and -2.97% in Mainland China. The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes are hitting resistance levels at 25,000 and 6,000 levels, while the Shanghai and Shenzhen are just above the 3400 and 1,1000 levels. Markets need further specifics on the government\u2019s stimulus plans to provide another boost\/catalyst. However, I suspect many institutional investors will use any pullback as a buying opportunity as we near the end of the quarter. All the talk of Chinese equities\u2019 outperformance is the year to date, but in the quarter, the one-year performance figure will be hard to ignore. An announcement about a Trump-Xi summit could also provide a catalyst. We\u2019ve heard chatter that it will occur in June, but nothing is definitive. Mainland investors did not buy today\u2019s dip with a rare net sell of just -$52 million. Healthcare in Hong Kong gained +0.62%, though -1.16% in Mainland China, as the State Council released a decree supporting traditional Chinese medicine. Auto was a rare bright spot today, as Geely Auto gained +1.45% after reporting strong Q4 results. It was a fairly quiet night. The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes fell -2.23% and -3.39%, respectively, on volume that increased +8.392% from yesterday, 180% of the 1-year average. 114 stocks advanced, while 372 stocks declined. Main Board short turnover increased by +10.37% from yesterday, which is 187% of the 1-year average, as 16% was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers\u2019 ETF hedging). Dividends, value, and small caps \u201coutperformed\u201d (i.e. fell less than) growth and large caps. Healthcare was the only buoyant sector, up +0.62%.

The top-performing subsectors were the auto, pharmaceuticals, and chemical industries. Meanwhile, consumer services, consumer staples distribution, and software services were among the worst-performing. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were 3x pre-stimulus levels as Mainland investors sold a net -$52 million worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, led by Alibaba, which was a moderate net buy, Meituan and Dobot, which were small net buys, XPeng, which was a small net sell, Xiaomi, SMIC, and Ping An Insurance, which were moderate net sells, and Tencent, which was a large net sell.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"ByJoshua Stein  ByJoshua Stein  Contributor.  Private equity is often blamed for increases in housing prices. Is this blame justified? Some Wall Street investors have turned their attention to buying single-family houses around the United States, renting them out for a monthly return and then selling when it makes sense for a capital gain. In response to private equity\u2019s involvement in the nation\u2019s housing market, we hear regularly that it\u2019s a \u201cbad thing\u201d for Wall Street investors to own and rent houses. Some argue that Wall Street crowds out regular homeowners in favor of private equity\u2019s participation in the market. That supposedly drives up prices and rents. Others argue that a professional class of investors is profiteering (a bad thing) off typical American households. Many don\u2019t like it when Wall Street seems to treat housing as a transient generic investment vehicle in the same bucket as stocks and soybean futures. For all these reasons and more, legislators from both sides of the aisle have talked about passing laws against Wall Street participation in the U.S. housing market. Is Wall Street ownership, management, and trading of properties such a bad thing? Not really, according to Ken Johnson, professor of real estate and finance at the University of Mississippi. Johnson says: \u201cThe critics are wrong, and their arguments fail basic economic logic. Most people (politicians included) are looking for a bogeyman to explain the current housing crisis, and Wall Street is the perfect scapegoat.\u201d Johnson argues that Wall Street investors bring much needed capital to incentivize developers to build more housing, thus helping to expand overall housing supply at a critical moment when many parts of the nation suffer from a \u201chousing crisis.\u201d Wall Street also brings improved pricing precision \u2014 more and better information analyzed by unemotional investment professionals. Greater pricing precision for any asset, including housing, reduces overall market risk. To put it another way, professional investors in the housing market deliver capital, pricing precision, and lower overall market risk for all \u2014 just as they do in other financial markets. Lower overall market risk tends to reduce the likelihood of another major crash of the housing market. That reduction in risk benefits both buyers and sellers and the larger economy. If, on the other hand, the government were to exclude professional investors from the single-family housing market, Johnson believes that would be just like forbidding them from investing in stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments, \u201cwhich all recognize as a monumentally bad idea,\u201d said Johnson. We shouldn\u2019t care who the buyers and sellers are, according to Johnson, just as long as there are plenty of them. That\u2019s how markets work best. And it is why Wall Street investors can help mitigate rather than worsen the nation\u2019s \u201chousing crisis.\u201d From the perspective of an individual household, renting and owning are reasonable substitutes for each other, said Johnson. From a sound housing policy point of view, though, they are complements to one another. \u201cIt is not a zero-sum game between renting and owning,\u201d he said. \u201cA sound housing market has a balance between the supply and demand for units to live in. Once society has the right number of housing units, it is then a matter of choice for households to rent or own. Unfortunately, the nation is at a point where we do not have enough total housing units. That\u2019s the crux of the problem. Wall Street investors aren\u2019t part of the problem. They are part of the solution because they help bring housing units to market. When Wall Street buys or incentivizes builders to build units, those units become part of the overall housing stock.\u201d If various governments want to \u201cdo something\u201d about the \u201chousing crisis,\u201d they should look elsewhere, starting with the development approval process, zoning, landmarking, building codes, and regulation, among other issues. \u201cScapegoating Wall Street (a possible solution) is not what we should be doing,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cI give them an A for effort and caring but an F in overall grade due to the total absence of economic reasoning.\u201d Follow me on LinkedIn.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Google has just released the Pixel 9a, giving some people who are shopping for the Pixel 9 another phone in the series that best fits their budget. It comes in four beautiful matte colors \u2014 Obsidian, Porcelain, Iris and Peony \u2014 and runs on the Tensor G4 processor, ensuring your phone receives the most optimal performance. It has a flatter camera frame than the premium models, trimming its weight and giving it an eye-catching design. It costs between $499 and $599, depending on whether you buy the 128GB model or the 256GB model, respectively. No matter what model you get, it runs on 8GB of RAM and brings you optimal performance with Google\u2019s Tensor G4 processor. If you\u2019re in the market for a new phone and are looking to get the Pixel 9a, you might be wondering if it has wireless charging capabilities. Most smartphones on the market are able to fill their batteries through wireless charging. Is the Pixel 9a any different simply because it\u2019s a budget Pixel phone? The answer will have you decide if it\u2019s worth the money. The Pixel 9a has wireless charging, but it\u2019s not as powerful as its premium counterparts. It only draws 7.5 watts of wireless charging power, which is similar to that of the Pixel 8a, despite it having a bigger 5,100mAh battery than the Pixel 9\u2019s 4,700mAh. Its slow wireless charging speed is determined by the fact that it can only be charged with Qi standard wireless chargers, so you may see your phone may not get wirelessly charged at the same pace as the Pixel 9, which supports 15W of wireless charging. The 30-plus hours of battery life may also be a factor in its slow wireless charging speed. If wireless charging is not an option for you, you can always choose to plug the Pixel 9a into a wired charger. It supports 23W of wired charging, provided you use Google\u2019s 45W USB-C wall charger. It\u2019s not much of an improvement from the 18W of wired charging the Pixel 8a had, but it\u2019ll still charge your phone faster than a wireless charger. Google\u2019s proprietary 45W USB-C wall charger is sold separately, but you can still use other wall chargers from other brands as long as it has a USB-C port. Google's latest addition to its affordable Pixel smartphone lineup, the Pixel 9a, serves up a slew of improvements at a competitive price. This model features a vibrant pOLED Actua display and Google's Face Unlock technology in addition to both Face Unlock and traditional fingerprint-based security. The phone comes in four matte color options, Obsidian, Porcelain, Iris, and Peony, and has slightly thicker bezels than Google's premium models. And with a Google Tensor G4 under the hood as well as 8GB of RAM, it's poised to handle anything you throw at it. But most importantly for some, how impervious to the elements is it? Can it handle a bit of water and everyday splashes? Google's higher-end Pixel models are known for their excellent water and dust protection, so it's understandable to question this cheaper model's reliability in that regard. With that in mind, is it safe to use the Google Pixel 9a around water? Is the Google Pixel 9a waterproof? \u00a0 After much speculation in recent months, the Google Pixel 9a has finally been announced. Google's Pixel A series is an excellent choice for those seeking a reliable Android smartphone at a lower price point, and the latest model follows this trend. While it is undeniably part of the Google Pixel 9 series, it has fewer features than its higher-end counterparts. One question you might have when considering the Pixel 9a is whether it comes with a charger. We\u2019ve got the answer The Pixel 9a does not come with a charger. The short answer is that the Pixel 9a does not have a charger. This has become common practice for most smartphones today, including other models in the Pixel 9 series, like the Pixel 9 Pro. While this may be disappointing, it's not surprising. The Pixel 9a has been officially revealed, and while it's an eye candy, there are some visible cutbacks over the more premium Pixel 9 and 9 Pro series phones. The other cutbacks we don't see include lower RAM than the Pixel 9 phones, which can limit the new mid-ranger's ability to run AI applications, despite running the same Tensor G4 chipset. Google's decision to limit the RAM to 8GB, compared to the 12GB on the more premium Pixel 9 phones, sacrifices its ability to run certain AI tasks locally. ArsTechnica has reported that as a result of the cost-cutting, Pixel 9a runs an \"extra extra small\" or XXS variant -- instead of the \"extra small\" variant on Pixel 9 -- of the Gemini Nano 1.0 model that drives on-device AI functions.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"I'm all for more power, but what's the point if we can't make use of it?  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  At GDC 2025, Qualcomm announced its newest lineup of processors that will soon make their way into Android gaming handhelds. Headlining the trio is the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, coming more than a year after its predecessor was released. It promises to provide a 30% CPU boost and an almost 30% jump to the GPU, which is nice on paper and probably in practice. Of course, these weren't the only announcements, as we also saw AYANEO, OneXSugar, and Retroid announce new gaming handhelds. AYANEO's introduction of the Pocket S2 comes as little surprise, seeing the original Pocket S was the first device to ship with the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2.  Until now, this operated as the most powerful chip for Android gaming handhelds, custom driver support notwithstanding. So naturally, I'm pretty darn excited to get my hands on the Pocket S2 and see whether the G3 Gen 3 performs as well as Qualcomm claims. However, at the same time, I've had this nagging question in the back of my mind: have we reached the point of diminishing returns? It's kind of the same feeling that I have when it comes to smartphones, as I feel that slab phones have reached their peak, which drives my commitment to foldables.  Thankfully, I don't feel the same when it comes to the design of gaming handhelds, as there's a lot more flexibility. But I don't actually know if we need faster and more powerful processors. Don't get me wrong, if RPCS3 for Android continues its breakneck pace in development and Winlator continues to improve; then this take will probably look pretty dumb. Even with Nintendo doing everything it can to put a stop to Switch emulation, the fact that you can use Android to play PS3, Switch, and PC games is mind-blowing. But in order to take advantage of that, you'll need to pony up a pretty penny.  When the AYANEO Pocket S Indiegogo campaign started, you were looking at a starting price of $399 for the 1080p base model. Currently, you can't actually buy the base model Pocket S, but before it went out of stock, you'd be looking at $559. You might know where I'm going with this, but that's more expensive than the 512GB Steam Deck OLED, which is quite a bit more capable than the Pocket S. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android At the same time, there's AYN with its Odin 2 lineup of Android gaming handhelds, all of which are powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. The trio of Odin 2 models offers a variety of RAM configurations, but the base model can currently be had for $299.  Right now, the company's latest handheld, the Odin 2 Portal with OLED, starts at $329. Even if you opt for the Odin 2 Portal (Max), with its 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, its $499 price tag is still less than the entry-level Pocket S. This is what worries me a bit about the status of high-end Android emulation. AYANEO didn't share pricing specifics for the Pocket S2, but considering that it's arriving with a brand-new Qualcomm chip, I suspect it'll be pretty darn expensive. And while a few design tweaks have been made, there's really not much of a compelling reason to get one unless you're a specs snob like me.  I don't know whether the Pocket S2 will tip the scales in one direction or the other. I think that the onus is being put on what the numbers look like with the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 and the Pocket Classic. The former is actually using the Snapdragon 865 from 2019, while the Classic is the first device to ship with the Snapdragon G1 Gen 2. Those are much more affordable, as Retroid is offering a bundle that includes both handhelds for under $330. Sure, they don't have the juice to play through your PS3 library, but you're still getting an incredible experience regardless. I'll be interested to see just how everything plays out and whether this new wave of Android handhelds brings more people into the hobby. It's wild enough to see niche companies partner with Qualcomm, but this might just be the start of something much bigger. Andrew Myrick is a Senior Editor at Android Central.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"ByMatteo Atti  ByMatteo Atti,  Forbes Councils Member.  Matteo Atti, Chief Marketing Officer at Vista, board advisor and professor at the International University of Monaco.   In Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3 of this guide on how to build your luxury brand, we talked about identifying your customer, the best distribution methods, and identifying your niche. The final section explores how to bring your nascent brand to market. A\/B testing is a mainstay of the digital world. It\u2019s a method that sees brands offer users two different versions of their website or app before getting them to select the best-performing one. Very few luxury businesses, though, apply testing across the board, which is surprising given it\u2019s a cost-effective tool that can help companies avoid investing too heavily in stock or producing too many wrong-for-the-market goods at scale. It\u2019s a tricky tightrope: Price your product too high, and you\u2019ll be perceived as arrogant. Go too low, and you won\u2019t be seen as an authority. Set prices that are: Undecided customers who want a black dress are more likely to gravitate toward an unknown luxury brand that offers the sixth- or seventh-highest-priced dresses\u2014cheaper than their competitors but still at a price that denotes the quality of the product. For a guide on how to market to luxury consumers, I would suggest checking out this guide I wrote last year: A clever social media game plan is imperative for luxury brands. Yet some businesses believe they won\u2019t need extra exposure. Bottega Veneta went off-grid in 2021 (it returned in 2023 on the Chinese platform Weibo). Even though Bottega Veneta still generates buzz on social media thanks to influencers and fans posting (fan account @newbottega has 1.5 million followers), it\u2019s a risky strategy. A good starting point is to think about what kind of relationship you want with your customers. Communicate as you would with a friend who lives in a different city. How do you keep in touch? Social media, of course. You can post an invitation to your barbecue on your channel, but there\u2019s no obligation for them to attend. It can be the same in luxury\u2014talk about your product so it remains active in consumers\u2019 minds but avoid dozens of daily posts and videos. Once your brand acquires some dedicated clients, you might be feeling content. However, your job is far from over: Keeping hard-won customers is one of luxury\u2019s biggest challenges. There are various strategies marketers can use: \u2022 Continuously innovate: Think of fragrance brand Le Labo and its personalized perfumes (often hand-blended and prepared in front of the customer) or Porsche, which allows customers to pick up new cars directly from the assembly line in Germany. \u2022 Extend your categories: Louis Vuitton has branched into perfumes; Bulgari has luxury hotels across the globe. Partner with other brands for an intriguing collaboration, such as Adidas by Stella McCartney or Vivienne Westwood with Palace. \u2022 Identify pivotal life stages that you can design for: If your customers are mostly in their 20s, think about what they will need when they\u2019re 30, 35, 40 or 70 years old. Not only is this a reliable way of reinventing your brand, but your consumers will feel you are intuitively anticipating their needs. In recent years we\u2019ve seen Chanel, Chopard and Armani cultivate their relationships with very important clients by inviting them to runway shows, sitting next to the designer at A-list dinners, staying in personalized suites and enjoying private tours. VICs were treated to a Christina Aguilera concert thrown by Dolce & Gabbana in Sardinia in 2024 and with tickets to the amfAR gala during the Cannes Film Festival. Reward your most dedicated customers and they\u2019ll reciprocate with their repeat custom. Think of your product as a diamond: Shine a light on it, and new colors or facets are revealed. If you\u2019re making trousers, don\u2019t reinvent the hosiery industry. Instead, create a new shape, a new seaming process, new places or occasions for people to wear your trousers, maybe even an art exhibition. As your product is part of people\u2019s lives, you\u2019ll need to constantly show new dimensions to make customers fall in love with it again and again. No luxury brand can make it alone: You need marketing and advertising agencies, retailers and overall support. Assess which contacts and introductions you\u2019ll need to get the business move forward. We\u2019ve seen many luxury brands flounder for one reason: They believe their own hype. A lack of humility is probably endemic to luxury. You need confidence to present what you believe is the best product possible. Also, the industry creates huge cycles of hyperbole, and it takes exceptionally down-to-earth entrepreneurs not to believe the voices\u2014especially when their team and strangers are singing their praises. Luxury brand leaders should realize their products only represent a small part of people\u2019s day-to-day existence. Yes, you might have developed the most remarkable fountain pen, but very likely it\u2019ll not change everybody\u2019s life\u2014even if you add a wallet as a side purchase. Instead, continually finesse your product by asking people for their opinion while you stick to your original vision. Players who remain true to their end goal but are unafraid to evolve will end up reaping the rewards for a very long time.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Business Insider Edition  Disney's content strategy can be summed up in seven simple words: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.          After a string of creative misfires at the box office during former CEO Bob Chapek's brief tenure, the House of Mouse has regained its mojo by playing the hits.               All of Disney's most successful movies last year were sequels or reboots, as CEO Bob Iger said Thursday at Disney's annual shareholder meeting.               The company produced each of the three highest-grossing movies of 2024: \"Inside Out 2,\" \"Deadpool & Wolverine,\" and \"Moana 2.\" Audiences made those installments of familiar films billion-dollar blockbusters. And \"Mufasa,\" based on 1994's \"The Lion King,\" fared fairly well.               Iger then listed some of the Disney movies he's most excited about this year: \"Snow White,\" a remake of the 1937 classic; \"The Fantastic Four: First Steps,\" which follows earlier Fantastic Four films from 20th Century Studios, \"Zootopia 2,\" the third \"Avatar\" movie, and a live-action version of 2002's \"Lilo & Stitch.\"               It's not all old hat from Disney, as Iger remarked. Marvel has \"Thunderbolts*\" coming in May, and Pixar is debuting an original film titled \"Elio\" in June.               But Disney fans and shareholders have taken note of this clear shift toward safer bets.               The first question for Iger during the shareholder meeting was: \"What are you doing to prioritize the importance of creativity across the company?\"               Iger's seemingly unscripted response was quite telling.               \"Our creativity is, in fact, soaring,\" he said. He named nine titles, from \"Avatar: Fire and Ash\" to \"Zootopia 2,\" meant to typify Disney's creative spirit. But only one of those films \u2014 the action thriller \"The Amateur\" \u2014 will be brand new to audiences.               There are several reasons for Disney's risk aversion, particularly at a moment when the company is feeling the pressure from Wall Street. Its stock has made little progress in the past decade, and the company must select Iger's successor in the next year or so.               Research indicates people crave familiar movies and shows. Sequels and reboots require little explanation, which helps them cut through a crowded and cluttered media landscape where everyone is siloed in their own algorithms. Even if audiences aren't fired up for new installments, they may be more likely to remember and talk about them, which can reduce marketing costs.               Familiar films have a higher floor. While their upside might not be the same as a new breakout hit, they're also far less likely to be a financial flop.               And considering the pressure that Iger and Disney are under, big gambles on fresh ideas can backfire \u2014 just ask Chapek about the quickly forgotten bomb \"Strange World.\"               It's not just movies: Disney's original TV shows don't seem to be moving the needle much.               No Disney+ show made it onto Nielsen's top-10 ranking of streaming originals in 2024, LightShed Partnersfound. The streamer did have the chart-topping kids' show \"Bluey,\" but it's licensed to Disney from the Australian Broadcasting Corp. What's startling is that \"Bluey\" made up 9% of time spent with the streamer last year, per LightShed.               Faced with this tough reality, lead LightShed media analyst Rich Greenfield floated a seemingly unthinkable idea earlier this month that could have Hollywood shaking in its shoes.               \"The lack of traction in originals raises the question whether Disney should produce any meaningful original series for Disney+ or shift their focus to being a movie and TV rerun service (akin to the old Disney DVD vault),\" Greenfield wrote.               Hollywood creatives and audiences may balk at that idea. But box office totals and viewership data are the ultimate truth serum, and familiarity is winning over originality.               It's hard to fault Disney for taking note.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. According to one late 2024 survey conducted by the Game Developer Collective, over half of the game developers surveyed consider the VR market to be stagnant or in decline. Worse still, barely a quarter still believe the market is growing. Among developers not currently working on VR projects, fewer than half see any possibility of their studio investing in VR in the future. Even Apple\u2019s entry into the market doesn\u2019t seem to have made much of an impression on those surveyed. Meanwhile, research firm Omdia reported that sales of VR headsets dropped by 10 percent in 2024, with further decline expected in 2025. The big studios don\u2019t seem to have an appetite for VR. Despite the success of Half-Life: Alyx, Valve has yet to release anything else, instead focusing on multiplayer ventures like Counter-Strike 2 and Deadlock as well as hardware like the Steam Deck. Alyx was in 2020 and was only available on PC VR devices. Even Apple has failed to drive much developer interest with its Vision Pro headset. What\u2019s the problem here? Well, while technological limitations tend to ease and shrink over time, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case with virtual reality. It\u2019s hard enough to pack a ton of processing power into a portable device, but VR headsets need to be extra lightweight and comfortable. There\u2019s also the optical technology, which still has a way to go before we reach ultra-realistic immersion. Battery life is a concern, as is the susceptibility of some to VR motion sickness. There\u2019s also the need for ample physical space, with high-end PC-based setups requiring enough room to deploy external sensors. But even simpler options\u2014like the Meta Quest 3 or PSVR2\u2014can still be impractical in a smaller apartment or living room. There simply isn\u2019t always space to wield a lightsaber or move around freely. Despite constant technological advances and the involvement of major players, virtual reality still seems to struggle with the same problems today as it did years ago. Developers are reluctant, sales are falling, and the lack of major game releases makes it difficult to attract a wider audience. Will VR ever be the revolution once promised? Or will it remain an expensive niche for enthusiasts only? This article originally appeared on our sister publication M3 and was translated and localized from Swedish.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":" The retro live-action vibe is genius.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Fans had been lamenting the lack of marketing for Ubisoft's Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows, but the developer's Brazil office just demonstrated how to promote the game in the most surprising way. Instead of gameplay, the ad is a live-action production inspired by retro tokusatsu like Super Sentai (or Power Rangers for those in the US). The ad sees the Brazilian streamers Ruan Silva (Joga Zulu) and Thais Matsufugi transform into the Assassin's Creed Shadow characters Yasuke and Fujibayashi Naoe. Fans now think Ubisoft's main office could take learn some lessons (see our own Assassin's Creed Shadows PS5 review). \"You've come home from school, called your friends from the street, grabbed your snack and turned on the TV. It's time for your favorite show... but this time, the adventure is in Feudal Japan!\" Ubisoft Brazil writes in the caption of the video. The amusing ad even features an original song, Strike As One by Edu Falaschi. You don't need to understand Portuguese to be able to feel the tokusatsu vibes. The ad also fits in a knowing allusion to the debate over the game's historical accuracy. \"Ubisoft Brasil completely solved this game's marketing issues,\" is one of the hundreds of comments on the video. \"Ubisoft Brazil should take over the main company instead,\" was another opinion. And Ubisoft Japan seems to like it; there's already a Japanese version with the song sung by Taro Kobayashi, the Japanese musician who recorded the theme songs for Amazon Prime's Kamen Rider Amazons. Ruan and Thais have been sharing some behind-the-scenes shots from the production, showing that they had a blast making the unusual spot. A post shared by Thais Matsufugi (@thamatsu) A photo posted by on  A post shared by Ruan Silva (@jogazulu) A photo posted by on  It's not the first time that Ubisoft Brazil has won attention for its marketing initiatives. It's previously leaned in heavily on hyper-local relevance, using Brazilian memes and cultural references on TikTok.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Darden Restaurants (DRI) shares soared as executives\u2019 optimism about future demand outweighed mixed earnings for the last quarter, when two of the company\u2019s flagship brands \u2014 Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse \u2014 grew less than expected. \u201cEven if [consumers] say they\u2019re feeling less optimistic, we haven\u2019t seen a huge correlation between that and dining out,\u201d CEO Rick Cardenas said on Thursday\u2019s earnings call. \u201cAs incomes are going up and outpacing inflation, I think they\u2019re likely to keep spending.\u201d In an environment where retailers like Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT) are flashing warning signs that consumers aren\u2019t spending, any words from a chief executive indicating continued demand sparks a rally. The stock gained 5.8% as of about 11:40 a.m. in New York, bringing its gain so far this year to 6.8%.  Last quarter wasn\u2019t stellar: Darden\u2019s total same-store sales rose 0.7%, less than the 1.7% increase projected by analysts, with growth of 0.6% at Olive Garden and 2.6% at Longhorn Steakhouse both short of expectations. Ruth\u2019s Chris comparable sales fell, amid some softness in Darden\u2019s luxury brands. Net sales rose 6.2% to $3.16 billion, fueled largely by the addition of the Chuy\u2019s restaurant chain to its portfolio. Olive Garden is bringing back its Never Ending Pasta Bowl and its \u201cbuy one, take one\u201d promotions, which have historically been big traffic drivers, Cardenas said. Darden is pleased with the rollout of Uber Direct (UBER) to all Olive Garden locations, and is testing the service at the Cheddar\u2019s chain. Longhorn may continue to be a bright spot, according to Placer.ai, which said weakness in February was probably weather related as there was a strong rebound during the final week of the month.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Commerce Secretary Howard Luntick made a direct public recommendation on Wednesday that Americans should buy shares of Tesla (TSLA), the company run by Elon Musk. \u201cI think if you want to learn something on this show tonight, buy Tesla. It\u2019s unbelievable that this guy\u2019s stock is this cheap. It\u2019ll never be this cheap again,\u201d Lutnick said in a Wednesday interview on Fox News (FOXA)\u2019 \u201cJesse Watters Primetime.\u201d Before joining the Trump administration, Lutnick had led investment giant Cantor Fitzgerald for decades, accumulating a net worth of some $2.2 billion, according to Bloomberg News. Most of his wealth comes from his holdings tied to Cantor Fitzgerald, which added Tesla stock to its portfolio a few years ago. Although he agreed to divest his business interests in the bank within 90 days of his confirmation to lead the Commerce Department, Lutnick\u2019s sons Kyle and Brandon have been given top roles at the bank. Earlier on Wednesday morning, the bank also upgraded its rating for Tesla stock. Cantor Fitzgerald changed its rating to overweight from neutral and maintained a $425 price target, following a visit to Tesla\u2019s artificial intelligence data center and production line in Texas. Analyst Andres Sheppard cited several factors that give Cantor confidence in the company, including plans for autonomous rideshare services and humanoid robots. \u201cThe recent selloff represents an attractive entry point for investors,\u201d Sheppard wrote, warning that first-quarter sales will likely take a hit from anti-Musk protests.  Tesla stock has fallen about 35% so far this year, as the company faces backlash over Musk\u2019s role leading the controversial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk has become an easy target for protestors thanks to his status as the biggest spender of the 2024 presidential election, as well as DOGE\u2019s role in pushing layoffs and other cost-cutting actions.  Tesla has borne the brunt of that outrage as protestors across the world, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, protest against Musk. Projections for its first quarter sales have taken a hit and a major auto show has removed Tesla from its lineup to avoid protests. Although the groups behind the most popular protests emphasize nonviolent action, vandalism against Tesla property has ramped up. Tesla electric vehicles and dealerships have been vandalized across the U.S., while a new website claims to expose the personal information of anyone who currently owns a Tesla. \u201cIf today\u2019s the bottom or not, I can tell you what \u2014 Elon Musk is probably the best person to bet on,\u201d Lutnick said. He joins other top Republicans in defending or advocating for Musk as the protests continue. Congressional Republicans, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia \u2014 a Tesla stockholder who bought thousands of dollars worth of shares last month \u2014 have called for the Justice Department to investigate the attacks. Attorney General Pam Bondi on Tuesday said it had charged several people allegedly behind attacks on Tesla with charges that bring a five-year minimum sentence and will investigate \u201cthose operating behind the scenes to coordinate and fund these crimes.\u201d President Donald Trump, speaking from an event showing off Teslas on the White House lawn, promised that violent anti-Tesla protesters are \u201cgoing to go through hell.\u201d He also bought a red Model S, said he purchased a Cybertruck, and recommended his supporters to also buy a Tesla electric car.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Business Insider Edition  This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with Paul English, 61, a serial entrepreneur who founded the travel website Kayak. It has been edited for length and clarity.          I started Kayak when I was around 40 years old.               I'd previously sold a company called Boston Light Software. One day in 2003, I met with another entrepreneur, Steve Hafner, through a mutual connection, to talk about a travel company he wanted to start.               Steve wanted me to come on as the CTO. I said would, but only as 50\/50 partners. It was a bit arrogant of me, but Steve agreed. It was the beginning of a 10-year journey. In 2013, Kayak was acquired for $2.1 billion, and I left shortly afterward.               Years before starting Kayak, I was diagnosed with bipolar illness at 25. I was going through a manic period: talking really fast, not sleeping, working through the night and having panic attacks. It was affecting my marriage, so I went to a doctor and got a diagnosis.               Having a label was a tremendous relief. I read everything I could about bipolar illness, but hid my diagnosis for over a decade. I was fearful people would find me crazy.               I eventually told a few trusted people, which helped me feel less burdened. By the time I started Kayak, I'd learned to be more open about it.               Having bipolar illness affected my time at Kayak. I was sometimes reckless with decisions and sometimes overwhelmed my team. However, I think my vulnerability about living with bipolar illness also helped me to build a team culture where people could be open about their struggles.               After I agreed to start Kayak with Steve back in the early 2000s, I went home and played around on Expedia's website for about 15 minutes. I'm embarrassed I did so little market research, but I felt confident I could design a simpler, faster website.               Upon reflection, this confidence was probably a combination of my faith in my design chops plus some grandiosity that comes with bipolar illness.               During my career as an entrepreneur, I always operate on a team-first, customer-second, and profit-third basis. Magical teams build magical products, and magical products build magical profit and loss sheets.               At Kayak, I hired people who were fast, smart, and had good team skills. I brought on the four best engineers I'd worked with and asked them to bring in who they thought were the best. If we hired someone who was rough on other people and caused stress, we'd fire them if we couldn't cure them.               We were also extremely customer-focused at Kayak.               I took most of the customer support calls myself for the first year. Then, I got our engineers to do customer service \u2014 engineers became very motivated to fix problems, and customers were blown away by getting replies straight from the engineers.               We took Kayak public in 2012. We'd become very profitable and felt confident in the company.               We agreed on a deal with Priceline that year. They acquired Kayak for $2.1 billion in 2013 based on the purchase value at the time.               I stayed at Kayak for several months, but I wanted to try something new, so I stepped down as Kayak's CTO in December 2013.               I was open about my mental health while working at Kayak. I would email the company during Mental Illness Awareness Week, tell them a bit about living with bipolar illness, and let people know they can talk to me if they're struggling. I'd always get floods of appreciative emails back in response.               Bipolar illness had a big impact on how I showed up at work. During depressive days, I couldn't get out of bed. But during manic episodes, I was wild and reckless about wanting to try different things.               The hypomania that comes with bipolar illness gives you a sense of grandiosity and confidence, which can be good when you're trying to do something new. At Kayak, I'd get new ideas every day and come to the team with suggestions, but the team felt they couldn't handle all those ideas.               A senior VP started telling engineers not to do anything I asked them unless I asked them twice. When I found out years later, I was sad at first, but I can see that it was a good idea in hindsight.               There have been upsides. I've made some incredible friends through the Bipolar Social Club, a nonprofit I started in 2023. It's helpful talking to people with similar experiences.               I learned, even during the Kayak years, how to take advantage of the good parts of bipolar and manage the bad parts.               I think Kayak would have taken longer and may not have been as successful had I not had bipolar illness. Because of the enormous energy and grandiosity I had at Kayak, people would see my drive and how hard I worked, which led them to work hard too.               I've often said people follow confidence but are loyal to vulnerability, and I try to be both.               I'm very confident in some aspects of my life, like my product design capabilities, but I also try to expose my weaknesses.               I think people have followed my confidence but have also felt comfortable asking me for support if, for example, they struggled to focus on coding because they have ADHD.               We created a place where people worked really hard but would also be open about their struggles in private conversations.       Do you have a story to share about mental health in the workplace?

We've also spotted a deal on the MacBook Air 13-inch M3 model over at Amazon for only $999 \u2013 down from $1,299, which is a lovely $300 saving. This MacBook is a top choice for students, though be sure to double-check Apple's student discount offerings before committing to this deal to see if you can save even more.

This laptop might be a few years old now, released in July 2022, but that doesn't make it any less capable of running software such as Photoshop, Lightroom, and InDesign with ease. Save $600: This is a rare and very generous deal on the late 2023 model MacBook Pro. It includes an 11-Core M3 Pro chip, a 14-Core GPU + 16-Core Neural Engine, a whopping 18GB of unified RAM, and a stunning 14-inch Liquid Retina XDR Screen - what more could you need?  This is a top choice for various creatives, including photographers, videographers, and graphic and 3D artists.  Save $300: This MacBook with 16GB RAM is an excellent choice for those who need more multitasking power than the entry-level 8GB that you typically get for this price. It also has 512GB of SSD storage, which is excellent for content creators and its super light design offers great portability too. Price Context: While this is a great deal, it's not the lowest price we've ever seen on this MacBook, which was $844 during Black Friday.  Save $250: With this MacBook, you get a little less storage (256GB), but a generous amount of RAM, and 16GB is plenty for most creatives to multitask with.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":" \t\t\t\t\tBy Stewart Clarke    \tThe average temperature in Norway hovers around freezing at this time of year, but Nation\u2019s Dumbest, The Box, Nation\u2019s Toughest and other shows have made it a hot formats market. With the hunt on for the next global hit, savvy buyers are keeping a close eye on the Nordic country.  \tSeveral Norwegian formats have hit the international market at around the same time. That\u2019s partly happenstance, but also because broadcasters in Norway kept ordering new shows while others in Europe applied the brakes. That ensured a healthy pipeline of new projects, several of which are breaking cover now. \u201cWe never stopped, we heard about other broadcasters freezing commissioning and we just decided we had to stay in the game,\u201d one Norwegian commissioner tells Deadline.  \t            \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t \t              \tNews \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\t'Sea Battle', Gameshow Based On A Classic Ship-Sinking Strategy Game, Ordered By France's TF1\t\t \t\t\t                \tNews \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tInternational Insider: The Adult View On 'Adolescence'; CJ ENM Interview; Hillary Clinton On Ukraine War\t\t \t\t\t        The Fjord Assembly LineWhen it comes to formats, size isn\u2019t everything. \u201cBeing in a very small market forces us to be really innovative,\u201d says Silje Hestevik, Head of Development at commercial broadcaster TV2 when asked why Norway is having a formats moment. \u201cIt\u2019s a highly competitive market because Norwegians all have many subscriptions and they consume so much content. We\u2019re a small country with lots of gadgets and screens.\u201d     \t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t       \tAgainst that backdrop, risk-taking is not a choice but a necessity. \u201cEvery time we commission a new show that hasn\u2019t been aired before, either one locally developed or a format that hasn\u2019t traveled that much, for instance Bloody Game [a Korean format that has been successfully remade for TV2], it feels like we\u2019re taking a big risk \u2013 but we need to do that because otherwise the audience will leave us. They expect a lot of renewal,\u201d Hestevik says.  \tShe adds: \u201cThere\u2019s more competition and I think that also brings us closer to the Norwegian producers. We need to collaborate more closely.\u201d  \tTV2 is leading the charge but is not having it all its own way. Pubcaster NRK and others also have unscripted formats that are hitting the international market.  \tNRK has shows including Heist Academy and Nation\u2019s Toughest. The latter takes a group of people who specialize in a given field, takes away their home comforts, and tasks them with super hard trials that take place on an oil rig. In Norway, the show\u2019s following has grown over its five seasons with Season 6 coming. Formats distributor Lineup Industries sells it internationally.  \t           \tLineup Co-Founder Julian Curtis sees a through-line with Norway and other countries such as Israel, the Netherlands and South Korea, which are modest in size but wield outsize influence in the global formats biz.  \t\u201cThey all have a relatively small population and a lot of broadcasters, which means that they have tight budgets, but the producers there have also made a lot of the big international shows, Big Brother, The Traitors etc. The result is a highly skilled workforce who are used to working very creatively but on tight budgets.\u201d  \tHe spies another factor that gives Norway an advantage in the modern world of TV. \u201cThe broadcasters are commissioning digital first. They have linear channels, but they\u2019re not just thinking about the linear transmission and the slot, they\u2019re interested in the different metrics [across digital].\u201d  The Box OfficeEvery so often a format comes along, captures everyone\u2019s attention, and a flurry of deals quickly follows. The Box is currently that show. A raft of agreements were inked for local versions before the first season had finished in Norway. France\u2019s TF1 and the UK\u2019s ITV are among the buyers, ticking off two of the biggest territories in Europe. The show is sold by its producer, Seefood, rather than via one of big international distributors.  \tThe format sees celebrities put in brightly colored containers. When the container is opened, they immediately face a game or challenge, with zero preparation or forewarning. It was created when an unspecified streamer asked for a global format, but ultimately it was broadcaster TV2 that gave it a green light.   \tSeefood\u2019s Aleksander Herresthal created the format. He says that during the pandemic and at the end of the second lockdown, he was frustrated with the everyday routine we\u2019d all been forced into. A friend helped the Norwegian indie boss shake off the lockdown ennui with a surprise rafting trip. That provided the creative impetus for The Box, he explains.  \t\u201cIt sparked the thought process of, you know, we all go into these patterns, we do the same thing every day, how do we break out of that. That was kind of the theme for the show. And then the box itself, that was the physical way of creating a format around that experience.\u201d  \tHe continues: \u201cIt\u2019s simple, it\u2019s easy to understand, and you need that, but the most important thing for me is that it doesn\u2019t resemble something else; it doesn\u2019t look like a version of The Traitors.\u201d  Dumb CelebsNorway has a pedigree with reality competition shows and several of the new wave fit that bill. 71 Degrees North, which saw celebs compete to be the first to reach the 71st parallel, is over 20 years old and sold well internationally. Seefood\u2019s military bootcamp format Kompani Lauritzen has fared well locally.  \tThe creators of Nation\u2019s Dumbest, in which 12 celebrities fight it out to be eliminated from the competition as quickly as possible to avoid being crowned the nation\u2019s dumbest, have remixed the formula. \u201cThere\u2019s tough competition in Norway to sell TV shows and there\u2019s a lot of good reality shows as well, so we thought: Okay, what we don\u2019t have is a competition [format] where you don\u2019t want to win,\u201d says Erik Solbakken who created the show with J\u00f8rgen H\u00f8st through their Montreux Film & Fjernsyn indie label.  \t\u201cWe love great achievements, but there are too many stories about celebrities doing something fantastic and being the smartest or strongest. Let\u2019s turn it upside down and find the dumbest celebrity.\u201d  \t           \tViewers took to the show in big numbers. It garnered a 33.9% share on TV2, healthily over double the slot average. \u201cWe expected it to do well, but the success was just mind blowing, it was the most watched show on TV2 last year,\u201d says TV2\u2019s Hestevik.  \tThe show pokes fun at celebs but is not snarky, H\u00f8st adds. \u201cWe wanted to make fun of the celebrities, but we also wanted it to be a warm show with a comedy feeling. We didn\u2019t know if we would succeed with that, but people really thought that it was great to see celebrities who don\u2019t take themselves too seriously.\u201d  Northern HighlightsBBC Studios moved for the international rights to Nation\u2019s Dumbest and is distributing. \u201cThat top line of \u2018it\u2019s the competition that no-one wants to win\u2019 is just really simple, and a hooky title is important in today\u2019s market,\u201d says Sumi Connock, EVP, Global Creative Network & Formats at BBC Studios. \u201cThen when you actually come to the show it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s warm, it\u2019s play-along and it\u2019s got a great arced narrative.\u201d  \t\u201cIt also highlights that you can be brilliant at one thing, but it doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re necessarily brilliant at everything. Underlying that is what does it mean to be clever?\u201d  \tIn terms of what\u2019s next, the Montreux Film & Fjernsyn crew have a celebrity fishing format they are launching. Lineup, meanwhile, is taking another NRK show to market. Whodunnit: Easter Or Die followed ten celebs who were invited to a mountainous snowbound resort. They have been summoned by a celebrity-obsessed murderer and must play their twisted games, with the loser of each round getting theatrically killed off. The celebs must unmask the killer before they\u2019re all bumped off.  \tAll of the abovementioned shows help illustrate why chilly Norway is becoming a hot spot, namely a willingness to greenlight new ideas and producers generating a crop of smart and affordable formats. \u201cIt is a market that is taking more creative risks,\u201d Connock says.  \t\u201cShrinking budgets can lead to less risk taking, but on the flip side, tighter constraints can also breed amazing creativity and innovation. It\u2019s a territory that can deliver these really creative ideas but do them cost effectively. That combination of a desire to take risks combined with the ability to deliver at a competitive price is producing really good results.\u201d Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Reporter Jacob Bushno, a federal employee from Illinois, served two tours in Iraq as part of the Army\u2019s air assault division before taking jobs at the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service. Bushno was fired in early February along with thousands of other probationary employees. Reporter Jacob Bushno has spent his entire adult life serving his country. He enlisted in the military straight out of high school. After two tours in Iraq as part of the Army\u2019s air assault division, he transitioned into civilian service in the federal workforce. Last month, just seven days before finishing his one-year probationary period with the U.S. Forest Service, he was abruptly fired. This week, he was rehired. Like many of the thousands of federal workers caught in the crosshairs of President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to shrink the federal workforce, Bushno has spent the last few weeks frustrated and confused. But as a veteran, he views his treatment by the new Administration with a different lens.\u00a0 Advertisement Advertisement \u201cI feel very betrayed. All I\u2019ve done my whole life since getting out of high school was serve this country,\u201d says Bushno, 40, who worked in the Shawnee National Forest in Illinois. \u201cI feel like, who's fighting for me, you know?\u201d Bushno\u2019s rehiring came after a federal judge on Monday ruled the Trump Administration\u2019s mass terminations of probationary workers was illegal. Even as Bushno prepares to return to his position, he remains skeptical about the Administration\u2019s commitment to those who have served. \u201cI don\u2019t trust it, and I think they\u2019re gonna terminate probationary employees again,\u201d he says. The impact of the Trump Administration's job cuts has reverberated across the federal workforce, where veterans make up nearly 30 percent of civilian employees. The Department of Veterans Affairs has not been spared, with over 1,000 employees\u2014including staff at the Veterans Crisis Line\u2014dismissed. While some have since been rehired, many remain in administrative limbo, left wondering whether they will ever be reinstated. Read more: Trump Administration Has Reversed Course More Than A Dozen Times To some veterans, the wave of firings, as well as cuts to workers tasked with helping veterans, has raised deeper questions about the Trump Administration\u2019s commitment to those who served their country in uniform. They say the cuts present a contradiction at the heart of Trump's messaging: while he often positions himself as a champion of veterans, his Administration\u2019s policies in its first months have placed many former service members in financial and professional jeopardy. \u201cIf they're the patriotic party, why are you guys firing disabled veterans?\u201d asks Bushno, who says he has PTSD from his tours in Iraq. The political fallout from the firings may already be shaping upcoming congressional battles and the 2026 midterm elections. VoteVets, a progressive veterans\u2019 organization, recently launched a six-figure ad campaign targeting Republican lawmakers in competitive districts, highlighting the economic uncertainty veterans face under the Trump Administration. The ad features laid off veterans discussing their growing frustration with the political forces behind the job cuts. \u201cI did not put my life on the line for some tech bro billionaire from South Africa to come in here and try to destroy our country,\u201d one of the veterans says, referring to White House advisor Elon Musk, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has played a role in the cuts. Exit polling from the November presidential election showed that veterans were much more likely to support Trump than his opponent, with more than 6 in 10 veterans casting their ballot for him. Ross Dickman, the chief executive of Hire Heroes, a nonprofit that helps veterans find employment, said his organization has seen a sharp increase in veterans seeking help compared to a year ago. He cautioned that while the labor market is strong, \u201cit\u2019s not enough to really overcome the amount of unemployed veterans that we\u2019re going to see entering the market.\u201d Tony Ruiz, a veteran from Orange County, Calif., was proud to be hired by the Department of Veterans Affairs last year as a Veteran Service Representative. Then he was fired last month, 10 days before his probation period was set to end. He says he was especially shocked to see the phrase \u201cunacceptable performance\u201d in his termination letter, after becoming the first employee in his division to win an employee of the quarter award in August. The firing left Ruiz feeling abandoned: \u201cI feel like I got a big F-you from the American people, and I feel betrayed.\u201d Ruiz says he had been recruited for the position by the VA and jumped at the opportunity. \u201cI said to myself, this is a chance to serve my country again, serve the veterans again. So I took it, but ultimately it cost me my livelihood and it cost my career,\u201d he says.\u00a0 Although he was technically still a probationary worker like many others let go, Ruiz suspects his firing was politically motivated and a result of his criticism of emails sent by the acting secretary to VA employees unwinding some of the agency\u2019s diversity, equity and inclusion policies. Unlike other probationary employees, Ruiz has not been offered reinstatement and believes it\u2019s because he failed the Administration\u2019s unofficial \u201cloyalty test.\u201d \u201cAs an American soldier, as a veteran, we value the oath. And so for me, I didn't take an oath to a king, or take an oath to the Administration.\u201d \u201cI'd rather be homeless\u2026 than to bow down to Donald Trump,\u201d he adds. In a statement to TIME, VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said that Ruiz was fired for \u201cpoor performance\u201d and that \u201chis dismissal had nothing to do with VA\u2019s Feb. 13 and Feb. 24 probationary termination announcements.\u201d In Congress, Democrats are pushing legislation aimed at protecting veterans in the federal workforce. Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Andy Kim of New Jersey introduced a bill last week that would require the Trump Administration to reinstate veterans who were terminated and provide transparency on future dismissals. Duckworth, herself a disabled veteran, has been particularly outspoken, calling the Administration\u2019s actions a betrayal. \u201cHe says he loves veterans. No, he doesn't,\u201d she tells TIME. \u201cHe's firing veterans left and right. These are people who served their country in uniform and then chose to enter federal service to continue serving this country.\u201d Trump has repeatedly defended the workforce cuts. Asked last week whether he feels responsible for people losing their jobs, Trump said: \"Sure I do. I feel very badly ... but many of them don\u2019t work at all. Many of them never showed up to work.\" White House counselor Alina Habba on March 4 suggested that some veterans working in the federal government were perhaps \u201cnot fit\u201d for their positions. \u201cAs you know, we care about veterans tremendously\u2026 But at the same time, we have taxpayer dollars, we have a fiscal responsibility to use taxpayer dollars to pay people that actually work,\u201d Habba told reporters. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that we forget our veterans by any means. We are going to care for them in the right way, but perhaps they\u2019re not fit to have a job at this moment, or not willing to come to work. \u2026 I wouldn\u2019t take money from you and pay somebody and say, \u2018Sorry, they\u2019re not going to come to work.\u2019 It\u2019s just not acceptable,\u201d Habba said. In response to a lawsuit filed by 20 Democratic attorneys general, U.S. District Judge James K. Bredar on Monday ruled that the mass firings were conducted illegally and ordered the administration to reinstate affected employees. More than 24,000 probationary employees across 18 agencies have since been offered their jobs back. Agencies are still sorting out how to bring back those workers and give them the back pay ordered by the courts. Yet the Trump Administration has signaled that its broader push to downsize the federal workforce is far from over. Already, the VA is planning to cut more than 80,000 workers beginning in June in an attempt to return to 2019 staffing levels, according to an internal memo obtained by TIME. Other agencies are planning similar reductions. Despite his misgivings with the new Administration, Ruiz says he fears losing his house and would take his job back if offered. \u201cBut then again if they don\u2019t, I will never work for this government again,\u201d he says. \u00a9 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"     The new phone, which costs just over $1,000, has a wide display and does not include Google's Android software.    The phone feels like Huawei's take on a Galaxy X Flip. Huawei is starting its fully Android-free era with the Pura X, a new foldable phone that runs the company's HarmonyOS 5 software and does not include the option for people to use Google's OS. The Pura X is also unique in a few other ways. Its wide 6.3-inch display has a 16:10 aspect ratio, which is unusual for a foldable flip phone. The phone also comes with Xiaoyi, a new AI assistant that uses Huawei's artificial intelligence models as well as some from China's DeepSeek. The phone starts at 7,499 Chinese yuan, or about $1,037. The company has been struggling for several years in the US market due to sanctions that restrict it from using technology from American companies including software and hardware components. The final break from Google for this device could represent a significant step forward for Huawei. The company is already the leading smartphone maker in China and last year was ahead of Samsung (but behind Apple) in global market share. The new phone's unusual form factor includes a 3.5-inch square screen on the outside and a wider-than-usual main screen when opened. Several social media accounts, such as Tech Way on Threads, have already posted hands-on videos of the device. The phone can take calls and shoot photos while folded. While the device is not yet available internationally, it has gone on sale in China in a regular and collector's edition, which features different panel designs in green and red and includes 16GB of RAM. The base Pura X is available in three colors: black, white and silver. The company debuted another foldable, the Mate X6, back in December.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"The graphics card world might just be poised on the brink of a radical shift  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5060 graphics cards may not be landing on shelves as soon as we thought, based on the latest churning from the rumor mill. VideoCardz brings news of a theoretical delay of around a month, courtesy of the Board Channels forum over in China (as flagged by HXL on X). However, we must remember that the previous launch schedule was just a rumor, and any delay is just that \u2013 a theoretical pushing back of what might only have been a pencilled-in release (or reveal) date. NV notifies AIC partners of RTX 5060Ti\/5060 delayed releasehttps:\/\/t.co\/VFxgs92PoL pic.twitter.com\/W6csIdEBylMarch 20, 2025 Those past rumors floated the idea that Nvidia was going to launch the RTX 5060 Ti GPU in March, and possibly the RTX 5060 vanilla GPU in April (or thereabouts). Other speculation suggested a mid-March announcement (which clearly didn\u2019t happen). Now, the theory is that the RTX 5060 Ti (both rumored 16GB and 8GB flavors) has been put back to mid-April, and the vanilla RTX 5060 is expected to arrive in mid-May. There\u2019s an added warning that these graphics cards could be pushed back further, as these are just rough timeframes \u2013 not specific launch dates. That indicates this purported plan from Nvidia isn\u2019t yet set in stone, and is just an indication of launch timing for now.  If there is a hold-up here \u2013 and I must emphasize the if \u2013 then what could be the reason? Well, it\u2019s certainly believable that Nvidia needs more time to get its act together in terms of ensuring that there\u2019s enough RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti stock for a solid launch. As opposed to the shambles of ridiculously thin availability that has been the hallmark of the Blackwell generation of GPUs thus far. The first point to consider here regarding the believability factor for this apparent delay is that there\u2019s been chatter from the GPU grapevine for a while that Nvidia has been pushing back RTX 5060 models (before this latest rumor), due to running into various issues \u2013 and that has been coupled with predictions of limited supply. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. It also makes sense that Nvidia might want to take its time to ensure that any of the purported problems are fully ironed out \u2013 especially after the ROPs controversy with RTX 5000 GPUs \u2013 and to accumulate stock so there\u2019s a decent amount on shelves to begin with. Team Green really does need to do better in terms of getting some goodwill from PC gamers, who are starting to become seriously frustrated with the new Blackwell GPUs. All of this is especially important to deal with when it comes to the RTX 5060 GPUs because they are at a lower price point, so will be far more popular and sought after than previous models. So clearly, Nvidia needs to ensure more chips have come off the production lines for these GPUs \u2013 well, you\u2019d hope, anyway \u2013 which may take more time than the firm first thought. We shall see, but the bottom line here is that those rumors which planted the expectation of an RTX 5060 launch of some variety happening soon are apparently wrong. Or perhaps they may have been correct at the time, but Nvidia\u2019s gameplan has just changed (as ever, sprinkle a whole lot of salt over that assertion, and all the previous ones for that matter). Meanwhile, the obvious danger in waiting is that AMD supposedly has a good amount of RX 9070 inventory on the horizon for a restock, and Team Red already looks to be making headway with clawing back GPU market share from Nvidia. And with RX 9060 models planned for launch in Q2 2025, so that could well be a May arrival, Nvidia could be feeling under considerable pressure.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"One of the best-known (and most optimistic) analysts covering Tesla declared the company is in \u201ccrisis\u201d and Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest man and Tesla\u2019s chief executive officer, must recommit himself to his electric vehicle firm, adding further fuel to the Wall Street pushback on Musk\u2019s time-consuming and controversial role in the Trump administration. President Donald Trump, right, shows off a Tesla Cybertruck last week. \u201cMusk needs to change course here...Tesla's future depends on it,\u201d Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a Wednesday evening note to clients. Musk dedicating \u201c110%\u201d of his time to his White House role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency has \u201cessentially turned Tesla into a political symbol,\u201d which is a \u201cbad thing,\u201d according to Ives, alluding to the widespread protests and vandalism facing Tesla showrooms and the sharp declines in early-year Tesla sales in several regions analysts have associated with Musk\u2019s polarizing politics. \u201cI loudly urge Musk and the Board to step up, stop being silent, and help resolve this crisis forming at Tesla,\u201d wrote Ives. Ives\u2019 criticism is particularly notable considering he maintains the highest share price target for Tesla of any American analyst as its stock gets battered, according to FactSet. His $550 target for Tesla stock implies more than 130% upside from its $232 share price Thursday. Musk needs to \u201ctake a step back\u201d from DOGE, according to Ives. He laid out two primary ways Musk can alleviate the nerves of investors, by formally announcing he plans to at least \u201cbalance\u201d his role as Tesla boss and White House advisor, and by giving long-awaited updates on Tesla\u2019s lower-cost vehicles and its full self-driving rollout. 52%. That\u2019s how much Tesla shares are down from their December all-time high, shedding more than $700 billion in market value. The stock declined about 2% Thursday morning, heading toward its ninth consecutive week in the red. A slew of firms covering Tesla have issued negative reports on Tesla, as the likes of RBC and Mizuho dramatically lowered their price targets, while Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and UBS all cut their vehicle delivery forecasts. \u201cWe struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,\u201d JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote last week. After donating $288 million to pro-Trump groups and other GOP causes last year, Musk has stepped into a highly powerful role as Trump\u2019s top lieutenant in charge of reducing the federal government footprint. Tesla investor frustrations with how Musk dedicates his time are not new, as shares of Tesla declined nearly 70% in 2022 as the market soured on Musk\u2019s $44 billion acquisition of the social media company now known as X, though the stock later rebounded as Tesla helped lead a broader rally tied to artificial intelligence optimism. In a rare recent positive beacon from Wall Street, Cantor Fitzgerald analysts Anand Balaji and Andres Sheppard upgraded their rating for Tesla from neutral to overweight. Balaji and Sheppard described the stock\u2019s ongoing slump as \u201can attractive entry point\u201d for investors with a longer-term horizon who can stomach volatility, naming Tesla\u2019s forthcoming robotaxi and Optimus humanoid robots as reasons for their optimism. Tesla stock\u2019s slide has become a hot-button issue among the most powerful names in U.S. politics. Former vice presidential candidate, Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., cheerfully said Tuesday he checks Tesla\u2019s downward-trending share price daily, while, during a Wednesday appearance on Fox News, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick took the highly unusual step of recommending viewers to \u201cbuy Tesla\u201d because it\u2019s \u201cunbelievable that this guy's stock is this cheap.\u201d The billionaire Lutnick stepped down from his posts as Cantor Fitzgerald\u2019s chief executive officer and chairman last month following his confirmation in Trump\u2019s cabinet. Musk\u2019s $327 billion net worth is more than $100 billion than anybody else\u2019s, according to our latest calculations. For the first time in six years, it\u2019s Musk\u2019s stake in the private aerospace company SpaceX, not his equity in Tesla, which is the primary driver of his fortune.   One Community.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"ByAndrew Williams  ByAndrew Williams,  Contributor.  Meta Quest 3S VR headset According to the latest analytics figures, global shipments of VR headsets fell significantly in 2024, despite the release of the Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3S. Shipments fell by 12% in 2024, compared to 2023\u2019s figures, says Counterpoint Research. It blames the familiar issues levelled at VR and AR headsets, including a \u201clack of compelling content beyond entertainment, eye fatigue from prolonged use, and the ongoing trade-offs between performance, headset weight, battery life and heat dissipation.\u201d The shipment figures also suggest the October 2023 release of the Quest 3 brought with it more excitement than the cheaper Quest 3S, which arrived a year later in October 2024. More recent months have seen Meta reassert its grip on the VR market, though. Its shipments represented 84% of the market in Q4 2024, compared to 65% in Q3 2024. Big market share drops over that period include those of Apple and Pico \u2014 their Vision Pro and Pico 4 Ultra headsets steamrolled on pure unit numbers by the launch Q4 launch of the Meta Quest 3S. It\u2019s not all bad news for the wider AR market, though. Counterpoint Research notes the growth of Chinese VR headset maker DPVR, thanks to growth in the \u201centerprise\u201d segment. The company also sells to the consumer, including the DPVR E4 headset made for PCVR. The analytics firm also forecasts a return to growth in 2025 and 2026, but that will be spurred by a \u201crebound\u201d in augmented reality smart glasses rather than VR headsets. January\u2019s CES and March\u2019s MWC tech expos were replete with smart glasses tech, with new pairs from Snap, XReal, Nuance and others. Meta also has plans for advanced smart glasses, dubbed Orion when the concept was announced in September 2024. Meta claims Orion represents \u201cthe most advanced pair of AR glasses ever made.\u201d It\u2019s yet to announce a release date, but says \u201cwe plan to begin shipping [consumer AR models] in the near future.\u201d Samsung\u2019s XR headset also promises to move the tech of larger-scale VR headsets forward too, with plans to a launch later in 2025 alongside Google\u2019s Android XR platform. However, as we heard earlier this month, it\u2019s not expected to be a big seller initially, much like the Apple Vision Pro. ","label":0}

All rights reserved. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t iPad 11 [left], iPad Air M1 [right] Apple's 2025 iPad 11 is Apple's new budget tablet. The biggest problem for it is that the 2022 iPad Air is almost always a better product for about the same money. Here's how the two compare.\r In our review of the 2025 iPad 11, we concluded that most users in the market for a new iPad are better served with the M1 iPad Air, versus the 2025 iPad 11. It turns out when you publish a review of a new product, and say that a product from a few years ago is a better deal overall, there's a demand for more detailed information than a passing remark or two.\rAnd, in that review, Managing Editor Mike Wuerthele noted that the 2025 iPad brings the value end of Apple's tablet spectrum in line with the rest, as far as design goes. \rAs a model replaced by M2 and M3-based variants, the first Apple Silicon iPad Air, using the M1 chip is clearly not new. Apple only has it in the refurb shop.\rEven so, there's a compelling argument for getting the older M1 iPad Air instead of the latest 2025 iPad 11. Here is the breakdown between the old iPad Air and the new iPad 11.\r2025 iPad 11 vs M1 iPad Air - SpecificationsSpecificationsM1 iPad Air2025 iPad 11Price (starting at launch)$599Available at Amazon$349Check sale pricesDimensions (inches)9.74 x 7.02 x 0.249.79 x 7.07 x 0.28Screen size (inches)10.911Weight (pounds)1.02 (Wi-Fi), 1.02 (Cellular)1.05 (Wi-Fi), 1.06 (Cellular)ProcessorM1A16Storage64GB,256GB128GB, 256GB, 512GBDisplay typeLiquid Retina,True Tone,Wide color (P3),Liquid Retina,True Tone,sRGB colorResolution2,360 x 1,640 at 264ppi2,360 x 1,640 at 264ppiBrightness (nits)500500 Apple PencilApple Pencil Second Generation,Apple Pencil USB-CApple Pencil First Generation,Apple Pencil USB-CConnectivityWi-Fi 6,Bluetooth 5.05G sub-6GHz (cellular)Smart Connector, USB-CWi-Fi 6,Bluetooth 5.35G sub-6GHz (cellular)Smart Connector, USB-CRear camera (MP)12MP Wide12MP WideFront camera (MP)12MP Ultra WideLandscape 12MP Center StageVideo recording4K at 24\/30\/60fps4K at 24\/30\/60fpsBiometricTouch IDTouch IDSpeakersLandscape StereoLandscape StereoBattery Size (Video playback time)10 hours10 hours2025 iPad 11 vs M1 iPad Air - Physical AppearanceIt's fair to say that there is a distinct level of similarity between the two models being compared here. Externally, they look the same, complete with the edge-to-edge display, the construction of the back, and button layouts. \rBoth rely on aluminum for the enclosure, which is modern and flat-sided, using Apple's current design language. The back looks quite similar too, with the use of one solitary camera and no expanded bump section. \rBoth also have Touch ID embedded in the top button, handling biometric security duties. \rIf you look carefully, there are some differences, but they are small. \r 2025 iPad 11 vs M1 iPad Air: Touch ID is located in the top button on both models. Externally, the easiest to spot is the front-facing camera. While it is on a short side on the iPad Air, meant for portrait orientation usage in calls, the iPad instead has it on a long edge, making it more useful when used in calls in a landscape orientation. \rWhen it comes to physical dimensions, the new iPad is ever so marginally bigger than the M1 iPad Air. The three-year-old model has a footprint of 9.74 inches by 7.02 inches, while the iPad 11 is a smidgeon larger at 9.79 inches by 7.02 inches. \rYou're not really going to notice this, unless you actively measure the two models.\r  iPad A16 (2025)  \r         The 2025 iPad is equipped with an 11-inch Liquid Retina display and A16 chip.\r        Sale price at Expercom   Grab exclusive savings on iPads at Expercom.    Buy at Amazon   Buy at B&H   Thickness, however, is more easily spotted, with the M1 iPad Air at 0.24 inches versus 0.28 inches for the iPad 11. The iPad Air is near enough 15% thinner than the newer model. \rThere's also a tiny bit more heft in the new model. While the M1 iPad Air is 1.02 pounds in both its Wi-Fi and Cellular forms, the iPad 11 is 1.05 pounds for the Wi-Fi model, 1.06 pounds for Cellular. \rAgain, these size and weight differences are unlikely to be considered as major enough to matter to consumers, since they are extremely minor. \r2025 iPad 11 vs M1 iPad Air - DisplaysWhen it comes to the screens, the extreme similarity between the models continues to be a thing. \rBoth models have what is referred to as a Liquid Retina display, referring to Apple's LED backlighting system and rounded corners of the screen. There's no difference in brightness, as each can manage up to 500 nits of brightness for SDR content. \rThe resolutions are also identical, with both at 2,360 by 1,640 pixels and a pixel density of 264 pixels per inch apiece. \r 2025 iPad 11 vs M1 iPad Air: Apple says the screens are 11 inches and 10.9 inches respectively. What could be considered a big difference is the quoted size of each, with the iPad Air said by Apple to have a 10.9-inch display, while the iPad 11 has an 11-inch screen. The problem is, it's not 11 inches. \rApple's technical specs for the iPad 11 discloses that it has rounded corners, and that when measured diagonally as usual, the screen size is really 10.86 inches. \rIn effect, Apple is rounding up what it calls the screen size. \rThere are still technological differences, with the iPad 11 having sRGB color coverage while the iPad Air boasts P3 wide color. Both do have True Tone support and a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating, but the iPad Air's also got an antireflective coating and is fully laminated. \rAs for Apple Pencil support, the iPad 11 can handle the USB-C Apple Pencil as well as the first-gen Apple Pencil, when used with the USB-C to Apple Pencil adapter. The iPad Air also uses the USB-C Apple Pencil, as well as the second-gen Apple Pencil with its double-tap feature. \rThe iPad Air has a bit of an advantage with its screen, but it's a slim one. \r2025 iPad 11 vs M1 iPad Air - PerformanceA big difference to take into account is the processing of each tablet. They are different generations and different classes of tablet, and that impacts the chips that are in use. \rThe iPad 11 uses the A16 chip, which is best known for being used in the iPhone 14 Pro and the iPhone 15. It's a chip that is two and a half years old. \rThe version of the A16 in use in the 2025 iPad 11 is one with a five-core CPU, with two performance cores and three efficiency cores, as well as a 16-core Neural Engine and a four-core CPU. \rOver on the iPad Air, the model being looked at has the M1, which has an eight-core CPU with four performance cores and four efficiency cores, an eight-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. \rAs a desktop-class chip with lots more cores, this should mean the M1iPad Air will do a lot better than the iPad 11's A16. \r 2025 iPad 11 vs M1 iPad Air: Geekbench Single-core BenchmarksThe Geekbench single-core benchmark for the iPad Air with M1 puts it at a score of 2,288. However, the same test for the iPad 11 brings up a result of 2,412, a marginally better result. \rHowever, the multi-core test lands squarely in the M1's favor, scoring 8,248 to 6,202. The obvious reason for this is core counts, as the M1 simply has more at its disposal. \r 2025 iPad 11 vs M1 iPad Air: Geekbench Multi-core BenchmarksLikewise, the Metal score on the iPhone 14 Pro is 22,721, while the M1 gets 32,193. Once again, we're talking differences in core counts here. \r 2025 iPad 11 vs M1 iPad Air: Geekbench Metal BenchmarksThis difference could've been reduced a bit had Apple used the A16 from the iPhone 14 Pro, which has a six-core CPU and five-core GPU. Alas, it did not. \rIt's safe to say that there is relatively little difference between the tablets in simple single-core tasks. But, if you open the taps with a multi-core or graphically intensive task, the M1 will do things much better. \rIt's also worth mentioning that the iPad 11 will not be able to take advantage of Apple Intelligence, simply because the A16 is just below the minimum specification for the features. The older iPad Air, complete with the M1 chip, does support Apple Intelligence, like all other Apple Silicon devices. \rIf you want to get on the Apple Intelligence bandwagon, the iPad 11 is not the way to go. \r2025 iPad 11 vs M1 iPad Air - Cameras and AudioAfter a diversion of difference in performance, we come back to similarity again by looking at the cameras. Both use the same 12MP Wide camera with an f\/1.8 aperture and 5x digital zoom. \rVideo capabilities for the cameras are identical, too, with 4K 60fps video, 30fps with extended dynamic range, a 3x video zoom, and Slo-Mo at 1080p 240fps. \rThe story's the same around the front, with a 12MP Ultra Wide camera used in each, complete with an f\/2.4 aperture, 2x zoom out, Retina Flash, and Center Stage support. \r 2025 iPad 11 vs M1 iPad Air: Stereo speakers and USB-C are in use in both models.The only differences for the cameras is the use of Smart HDR 4 for Photos in the iPad 11 versus Smart HDR 3 for Photos in the iPad Air, and the position of the front camera to be better used for landscape-orientation video calls. \rAudio is provided by landscape stereo speakers on both models, while a pair of microphones handle audio pickup duties. \r2025 iPad 11 vs M1 iPad Air - Connectivity and BatteryFor connectivity, both models take advantage of USB-C for physically charging and for data. The port is the same on both, located in identical places, with mirroring capabilities. \rBoth also have a Smart Connector on the rear, which can let you hook the respective tablets to keyboard accessories. \rFor wireless connectivity, there's Wi-Fi 6 on both models, but the newer iPad has Bluetooth 5.3 versus Bluetooth 5.0 in the iPad Air. This really isn't a major issue for the vast majority of uses and accessories. \rThere are two versions of each model, with Wi-Fi only and Wi-Fi + Cellular variants available for both. This is also fairly similar, with 5G support limited to sub-6GHz bands and not the faster mmWave connections. \rThe M1 iPad Air does benefit from having both a SIM card slot for a physical Nano-SIM and eSIM support. Apple's trend of supporting only eSIMs in new devices means you can't insert a physical SIM into the iPad 11 in the United States. \r2025 iPad 11 vs M1 iPad Air - Capacity and PricingThe iPad 11 is offered by Apple in a choice of three capacities: 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB.

In our review of the 2025 iPad 11, we concluded that most users in the market for a new iPad are better served with the M1 iPad Air, versus the 2025 iPad 11. It turns out when you publish a review of a new product, and say that a product from a few years ago is a better deal overall, there's a demand for more detailed information than a passing remark or two.\r And, in that review, Managing Editor Mike Wuerthele noted that the 2025 iPad brings the value end of Apple's tablet spectrum in line with the rest, as far as design goes. \r As a model replaced by M2 and M3-based variants, the first Apple Silicon iPad Air, using the M1 chip is clearly not new. Apple only has it in the refurb shop.\r Even so, there's a compelling argument for getting the older M1 iPad Air instead of the latest 2025 iPad 11. Here is the breakdown between the old iPad Air and the new iPad 11.\r It's fair to say that there is a distinct level of similarity between the two models being compared here. Externally, they look the same, complete with the edge-to-edge display, the construction of the back, and button layouts. \r Both rely on aluminum for the enclosure, which is modern and flat-sided, using Apple's current design language. The back looks quite similar too, with the use of one solitary camera and no expanded bump section. \r Both also have Touch ID embedded in the top button, handling biometric security duties. \r If you look carefully, there are some differences, but they are small. \r Externally, the easiest to spot is the front-facing camera. While it is on a short side on the iPad Air, meant for portrait orientation usage in calls, the iPad instead has it on a long edge, making it more useful when used in calls in a landscape orientation. \r When it comes to physical dimensions, the new iPad is ever so marginally bigger than the M1 iPad Air. The three-year-old model has a footprint of 9.74 inches by 7.02 inches, while the iPad 11 is a smidgeon larger at 9.79 inches by 7.02 inches. \r You're not really going to notice this, unless you actively measure the two models.\r Grab exclusive savings on iPads at Expercom. Thickness, however, is more easily spotted, with the M1 iPad Air at 0.24 inches versus 0.28 inches for the iPad 11. The iPad Air is near enough 15% thinner than the newer model. \r There's also a tiny bit more heft in the new model. While the M1 iPad Air is 1.02 pounds in both its Wi-Fi and Cellular forms, the iPad 11 is 1.05 pounds for the Wi-Fi model, 1.06 pounds for Cellular. \r Again, these size and weight differences are unlikely to be considered as major enough to matter to consumers, since they are extremely minor. \r When it comes to the screens, the extreme similarity between the models continues to be a thing. \r Both models have what is referred to as a Liquid Retina display, referring to Apple's LED backlighting system and rounded corners of the screen. There's no difference in brightness, as each can manage up to 500 nits of brightness for SDR content. \r The resolutions are also identical, with both at 2,360 by 1,640 pixels and a pixel density of 264 pixels per inch apiece. \r What could be considered a big difference is the quoted size of each, with the iPad Air said by Apple to have a 10.9-inch display, while the iPad 11 has an 11-inch screen. The problem is, it's not 11 inches. \r Apple's technical specs for the iPad 11 discloses that it has rounded corners, and that when measured diagonally as usual, the screen size is really 10.86 inches. \r In effect, Apple is rounding up what it calls the screen size. \r There are still technological differences, with the iPad 11 having sRGB color coverage while the iPad Air boasts P3 wide color. Both do have True Tone support and a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating, but the iPad Air's also got an antireflective coating and is fully laminated. \r As for Apple Pencil support, the iPad 11 can handle the USB-C Apple Pencil as well as the first-gen Apple Pencil, when used with the USB-C to Apple Pencil adapter. The iPad Air also uses the USB-C Apple Pencil, as well as the second-gen Apple Pencil with its double-tap feature. \r The iPad Air has a bit of an advantage with its screen, but it's a slim one. \r A big difference to take into account is the processing of each tablet. They are different generations and different classes of tablet, and that impacts the chips that are in use. \r The iPad 11 uses the A16 chip, which is best known for being used in the iPhone 14 Pro and the iPhone 15. It's a chip that is two and a half years old. \r The version of the A16 in use in the 2025 iPad 11 is one with a five-core CPU, with two performance cores and three efficiency cores, as well as a 16-core Neural Engine and a four-core CPU. \r Over on the iPad Air, the model being looked at has the M1, which has an eight-core CPU with four performance cores and four efficiency cores, an eight-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. \r As a desktop-class chip with lots more cores, this should mean the M1iPad Air will do a lot better than the iPad 11's A16. \r The Geekbench single-core benchmark for the iPad Air with M1 puts it at a score of 2,288. However, the same test for the iPad 11 brings up a result of 2,412, a marginally better result. \r However, the multi-core test lands squarely in the M1's favor, scoring 8,248 to 6,202. The obvious reason for this is core counts, as the M1 simply has more at its disposal. \r Likewise, the Metal score on the iPhone 14 Pro is 22,721, while the M1 gets 32,193. Once again, we're talking differences in core counts here. \r This difference could've been reduced a bit had Apple used the A16 from the iPhone 14 Pro, which has a six-core CPU and five-core GPU. Alas, it did not. \r It's safe to say that there is relatively little difference between the tablets in simple single-core tasks. But, if you open the taps with a multi-core or graphically intensive task, the M1 will do things much better. \r It's also worth mentioning that the iPad 11 will not be able to take advantage of Apple Intelligence, simply because the A16 is just below the minimum specification for the features. The older iPad Air, complete with the M1 chip, does support Apple Intelligence, like all other Apple Silicon devices. \r If you want to get on the Apple Intelligence bandwagon, the iPad 11 is not the way to go. \r After a diversion of difference in performance, we come back to similarity again by looking at the cameras. Both use the same 12MP Wide camera with an f\/1.8 aperture and 5x digital zoom. \r Video capabilities for the cameras are identical, too, with 4K 60fps video, 30fps with extended dynamic range, a 3x video zoom, and Slo-Mo at 1080p 240fps. \r The story's the same around the front, with a 12MP Ultra Wide camera used in each, complete with an f\/2.4 aperture, 2x zoom out, Retina Flash, and Center Stage support. \r The only differences for the cameras is the use of Smart HDR 4 for Photos in the iPad 11 versus Smart HDR 3 for Photos in the iPad Air, and the position of the front camera to be better used for landscape-orientation video calls. \r Audio is provided by landscape stereo speakers on both models, while a pair of microphones handle audio pickup duties. \r For connectivity, both models take advantage of USB-C for physically charging and for data. The port is the same on both, located in identical places, with mirroring capabilities. \r Both also have a Smart Connector on the rear, which can let you hook the respective tablets to keyboard accessories. \r For wireless connectivity, there's Wi-Fi 6 on both models, but the newer iPad has Bluetooth 5.3 versus Bluetooth 5.0 in the iPad Air. This really isn't a major issue for the vast majority of uses and accessories. \r There are two versions of each model, with Wi-Fi only and Wi-Fi + Cellular variants available for both. This is also fairly similar, with 5G support limited to sub-6GHz bands and not the faster mmWave connections. \r The M1 iPad Air does benefit from having both a SIM card slot for a physical Nano-SIM and eSIM support. Apple's trend of supporting only eSIMs in new devices means you can't insert a physical SIM into the iPad 11 in the United States. \r The iPad 11 is offered by Apple in a choice of three capacities: 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB. Pricing starts from $349 for the 128GB, rising to $449 for 256GB, and $649 for 512GB, with Cellular models costing an extra $150. \r Color-wise, there are four options: Blue, Pink, Yellow, and Silver. \r The iPad Air with M1 was sold in a choice of two capacities: 64GB or 256GB.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"After Donald Trump\u2019s surreal turn as a car salesman last week, the president\u2019s Cabinet members are now also taking turns as shills for Elon Musk. During an appearance on Fox News Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick gave a pitch for buying the billionaire bureaucrat\u2019s struggling Tesla stock.\u00a0 \u201cI think if you wanna learn something on this show tonight, buy Tesla! I think it\u2019s unbelievable that this guy\u2019s stock is this cheap. It will never be this cheap again,\u201d Lutnick said, appearing on-screen beside footage of burning electric vehicles\u2014the results of protests at Tesla dealerships across the country.\u00a0 \u201cWhen people understand the things he\u2019s building, the robots he\u2019s building, the technology he\u2019s building, people are gonna be dreaming of today and Jesse Watters, and thinking, \u2018Gosh, I should have bought Elon Musk\u2019s stock!\u2019\u201d Lutnick said, some laughter leaking through his desperate bid.\u00a0 \u201cI mean who wouldn\u2019t invest in Elon Musk, you gotta be kidding me!\u201d Lutnick continued.\u00a0 US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick tells Fox viewers to buy Tesla stock pic.twitter.com\/t0syL32sa3 Cantor Fitzgerald, the financial services firm once run by Lutnick but now helmed by his children, also upgraded Tesla stock from \u201cneutral\u201d to \u201coverweight\u201d Wednesday, citing a buying opportunity. At the end of 2024, Cantor Fitzgerald held roughly 740,000 shares of Tesla stock. So it seems Lutnick is trying to rescue Musk\u2019s falling stock to the benefit of his family business. \u00a0 Despite an initial \u201cTrump bump\u201d after Election Day, Tesla shares have fallen more than 40 percent since Trump took office, shedding nearly $121 billion of Musk\u2019s personal net worth.\u00a0 The hit to Musk\u2019s popularity resulting from his antics with the Department of Government Efficiency has also coincided with the release of competitive technology in China. Investors who once needed to play ball with the erratic Musk may be starting to realize that they might not have to.\u00a0 Last week, after Musk saw a huge drop in a single day (not unrelated to the market-wide fall caused by Trump\u2019s tariffs and recession waffling), the president refashioned the White House into a car dealership and held an eerie promotional event where he pretended to drive a Tesla.\u00a0 Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told the country Wednesday that Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are partially to blame for rising prices, and that the likelihood that the country will enter a recession has grown, but the president doesn\u2019t seem ready or willing to confront that reality. In an interview with Fox News\u2019s Laura Ingraham that night, the MAGA leader once again ducked and dodged direct questioning on whether his policies would result in an American recession. \u201cThere is a lot of talk about a possibility of a recession, and CNBC had a report from the Fed saying they can\u2019t rule it out. It could actually happen,\u201d Ingraham said, before Trump interjected that \u201ceverything could happen.\u201d \u201cWhat can you say to Americans tonight who are concerned about the possibility of a recession, given the fact that you\u2019re trying to reorient the economy to a manufacturing economy again?\u201d the Fox host continued. \u201cI think, if I didn\u2019t get elected, our country would be finished, to start off with,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I think I\u2014now that I did get elected, I think we\u2019re going to have the strongest economy in the history of the world. And I had that economy in four years. With all the harassment, with all the crazy people after me, with all of the things that went on, even with Covid, I had the strongest economy in the history of our country. \u201cI had a stock market that went up 88 percent: 88 percent, number one in history. The other markets went up 66 percent, and I think like 71 percent,\u201d he continued. But that didn\u2019t answer the question. \u201cWill we see a recession in 2025? Are you ruling it out?\u201d Ingraham pressed. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have the strongest economic country in the history of the world, of the planet. We are taking in so much money,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow, some people are unhappy, because it has to come from somewhere. Some of it\u2019s going to come from Europe, because not everybody\u2019s going to be doing as much business maybe in Europe and other places. But I can only speak for the United States. And I am a nationalist, and I\u2019m proud of it. I love this country. And I want to help other countries too. \u201cLook, I\u2019m the one. If it wasn\u2019t for me, they wouldn\u2019t be talking peace in Ukraine and Russia, because there are not Americans being killed. They\u2019re Ukrainian soldiers and Russian soldiers, and I\u2019m trying to make peace. And, again, it has not that much to do, other than, we don\u2019t want to be paying,\u201d Trump said, before continuing to blame former President Joe Biden for the cost of the conflict. Asked about the possibility of a recession, Trump claims the country was \u201cfinished\u201d if he wasn\u2019t elected pic.twitter.com\/zlbxEpjHEN In just a handful of weeks, Trump\u2019s global trade war has weakened America\u2019s relationships with some of its longest allies, compromising strategic military alliances while also sparking fears of a forthcoming recession as the market slumps hundreds of points in reaction to his whiplash tariff negotiations. Economic experts have always cautioned that Trump\u2019s tariff plan would hurt the country. In a joint letter released before the election, nearly two dozen Nobel Prize\u2013winning economists formally warned against Trump\u2019s economic plan, arguing that the MAGA leader\u2019s stiff tariff increases and tax cuts would spell disaster for the average American. Once Trump began to formally enact his tariffs in February, that concern went into overdrive. \u201cThis is a \u2018Stop or I\u2019ll shoot myself in the foot\u2019 threat. It defies economic logic,\u201d economist Larry Summers told CNN at the time. \u201cIt means higher prices for consumers. It means more expensive inputs for American producers.\u201d Earlier this month, Trump floated that the \u201clittle disruption\u201d caused by his aggressive trade policies could go on for quite a bit longer, suggesting that Americans should model their economic projections on a 100-year model\u2014like China\u2014rather than assess his performance on a quarterly basis. At least one Republican senator is willing to criticize Elon Musk\u2019s cuts to the federal government as part of his Department of Government Efficiency. Senator Lisa Murkowski called out the tech oligarch in a press conference on Tuesday in Juneau, Alaska, the capital of the state she represents. She criticized the mass firing of federal employees and freezing of federal funding in an address to the Alaska legislature the same day. \u201cThese terminations are indiscriminate, and many, we\u2019re now learning, are unlawful. And they\u2019re being made regardless of performance and with little understanding of the function and the value of each position,\u201d Murkowski said to the legislature. \u201cSo at any human level, they\u2019re traumatizing people, and they\u2019re leaving holes in our communities.\u201d She told reporters at the press conference that she knows her willingness to criticize Musk will likely come with consequences. \u201cIt may be that Elon Musk has decided he\u2019s going to take the next billion dollars that he makes off of Starlink and put it directly against Lisa Murkowski,\u201d the senator said to reporters. \u201cAnd you know what? That may happen. But I\u2019m not giving up one minute, one opportunity, to try to stand up for Alaskans.\u201d Murkowski has a theory about why her fellow Republicans aren\u2019t willing to criticize Musk or the Trump administration, even as their constituents grow angry over lost federal jobs and looming cuts to social services like Social Security and Medicaid.  \u201cThey\u2019re looking at how many things are being thrown at me, and it\u2019s like, \u2018Maybe I just better duck and cover,\u2019\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019ve got everybody just like, zip-lip, not saying a word, because they\u2019re afraid they\u2019re going to be taken down, they\u2019re going to be primaried.\u201d Murkowski isn\u2019t up for reelection until 2028, and defeated a Trump-supported primary challenge in 2022, so she has breathing room that other Republicans don\u2019t have. But Musk is the world\u2019s richest man, having donated more than $250 million to help Trump get elected, and his well-funded America PAC already has plans for the midterms to push out the politicians he doesn\u2019t like. Still, his GOP support isn\u2019t ironclad, and as Murkowski shows, cracks are beginning to form.  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt refused Wednesday to reveal how the government had identified the hundreds of supposed gang members who were flown to El Salvador over the weekend.  Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act on Saturday, hoping to use the eighteenth-century law to suspend due process and deport scores of noncitizens who his administration claimed were members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang. But the government has yet to provide any information on who those individuals are, or exactly how they were determined to be members of the gang, now declared an invading force.  During a White House press briefing Wednesday, ABC News\u2019s Rachel Scott asked Leavitt to reveal any actual information about the hundreds of people the government had deported.  \u201cCan the administration provide any more details on how authorities determined that each of those men were in fact members of a gang?\u201d asked Scott. \u201cAnd if the White House can publish images, photos, videos of those men, why can\u2019t the administration just release basic information like their identities and names?\u201d \u201cWe are not going to reveal operational details about a counterterrorism operation,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cBut what I can assure you, as I said on Monday, we have the highest degree of confidence in our ICE agents and our customs and border control agents who have committed their lives to targeting illegal criminals in our country, particularly foreign terrorists.\u201d Leavitt insisted that immigration authorities \u201chad great evidence and indication\u201d that those who were deported were foreign terrorists, or members of the Tren de Aragua gang.  Authorities \u201cwere 100 percent confident in the individuals that were sent home on these flights, and in the president\u2019s executive authority to do that,\u201d Leavitt said.  But there was cause for concern on the government\u2019s judgment from the beginning. Judge James Boasberg\u2019s original order Saturday was to prevent the deportation of five of the individuals, after two legal advocacy groups said that some individuals had been falsely labeled gang members. Boasberg later issued a second order for a total stay on any individual deported under the AEA\u2014but by then, planes were already in the air.  Meanwhile, ICE has openly admitted that it has nothing on several of the noncitizens who were deported, and implied that the lack of evidence was the very thing that helped the government assume their guilt.  ICE Acting Field Office Director of Enforcement and Removal Operations Robert Cerna argued that \u201cthe lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose,\u201d and \u201cdemonstrates that they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete profile,\u201d according to ABC News.  The family of one man, Francisco Javier Garcia, who was among the 261 individuals deported to prison in El Salvador, claimed that their loved one did not have a criminal record in the U.S. or in Venezuela, according to NBC Miami.  It appears that at least a few of the individuals rushed on the planes were marked as gang members simply because of their tattoos.  The White House said that of the 261 people who were deported, 101 were removed as part of \u201cregular immigration proceedings.\u201d  A French scientist on his way to a conference in the United States was allegedly denied entry by Customs and Border Patrol over messages found on his phone that criticized President Trump\u2019s science cuts. The French newspaper Le Monde reports that on March 9, a space researcher was randomly selected upon arrival in Houston for a search, and CBP found messages criticizing the Trump administration\u2019s treatment of scientists, which, according to the agency, \u201cconveyed hatred of Trump & could be qualified as terrorism.\u201d The researcher\u2019s phone and computer were allegedly confiscated, and he was sent back to Europe the next day. The news prompted the attention of the French government, which expressed alarm. \u201cI was told with concern that a French researcher, on a mission for the National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), who was going to a conference near Houston, was banned from entering the US before being expelled,\u201d said France\u2019s Minister of Higher Education and Research Philippe Baptiste, in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThis would have been taken by the US authorities because the researcher\u2019s phone contained exchanges with colleagues and friendly relations in which he expressed a personal opinion on the Trump administration\u2019s research policy.\u201d According to one source cited by Agence France-Presse, CBP said that the French researcher expressed \u201chate and conspiracy messages,\u201d prompting an FBI investigation, only for the charges to be dropped later. Another source said the scientist was banned due to messages \u201cthat can be described as terrorism.\u201d The incident marks a disturbing change in how visitors to the United States are treated. Legitimate criticism of the Trump administration occurs everywhere, and it\u2019s no secret that Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency effort has resulted in millions of dollars in cuts to scientific research. The idea that criticism of this would rise to the level of terrorism and result in someone being barred from the U.S. is absurd. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell confirmed that Trump\u2019s tariffs will make inflation worse. \u201cHow much of the higher inflation forecast for this year is due to tariffs, and since the policy path remains the same, are you effectively reading this as a one-time price level shock?\u201d a reporter asked Powell at his press conference on Wednesday.\u00a0 \u201cYou may have seen that goods inflation moved up pretty significantly in the first two months of the year.\u2026 Some of it\u2014the answer is, clearly, some of it, a good part of it\u2014is coming from tariffs,\u201d Powell replied. \u201cWe\u2019ll be working, and so will other forecasts, to try to find the best possible way to separate non-tariff inflation from tariff inflation.\u201d Powell also noted that Trump\u2019s tariffs have made it harder for the economy to achieve price stability for consumers and for the Fed to get back to its goal of 2 percent inflation.\u00a0 \u201cI think we were getting closer and closer to that. I wouldn\u2019t say we were at that. Inflation was running around two and a half percent for some time,\u201d Powell said. \u201cI do think with the arrival of the tariff inflation, further progress may be delayed. The [Summary of Economic Projections]\u00a0doesn\u2019t really show further downward progress on inflation this year, and that\u2019s really due to the tariffs coming in.\u201d\u00a0 Trump has insisted that his tariffs\u2014for now, just 10 percent on imports from China with broader tariffs on the way on April 2\u2014are merely transitionary policies that will help consumers much more than they hurt. \u201cLook, what I have to do is build a strong country,\u201d the president said last week as his tariffs caused the stock market to tumble. \u201cThe tariffs could go up as time goes by, and they may go up. We may go up with some tariffs. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll go down, but we may go up.\u201d We heard it from the horse\u2019s mouth: Trump is shooting himself and every American consumer in the foot by levying aggressive tariffs on imports, all while promising to lower inflation. He\u2019s insisting that he can have both. That couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\u00a0  President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is going all in on smearing the federal judge who ordered the White House to hold off on its massive deportations\u2014and now it\u2019s just making stuff up. During a press briefing Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt railed against Judge James Boasberg, who called a hearing after the Trump administration allegedly defied his order to pause deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. As Trump\u2019s lead propagandist, Leavitt attempted to paint Boasberg as \u201ca Democrat activist,\u201d but unfortunately for her, she got her facts wrong. \u00a0 \u201cHe was appointed by Barack Obama, his wife has donated more than $10,000 to Democrats, and he has consistently shown his disdain for this president and his policies, and it\u2019s unacceptable,\u201d she said. NBC News\u2019s Garrett Haake was forced to step in, correcting Leavitt\u2019s mistake. \u201cJudge Boasberg was originally appointed by George W. Bush, and then elevated by Barack Obama,\u201d Haake said. \u201cJust feel like I should clear that up.\u201d Boasberg was first appointed to D.C. Superior Court in 2002 by Bush, and then appointed to the federal bench by Obama in 2011. In 2014, he was appointed to the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court by Chief Justice John Roberts, where he served a seven-year term.\u00a0 Haake also asked whether Trump was serious about pursuing his threat to impeach Boasberg, considering that it would require a whopping 67 votes in the Senate. Roberts issued a rare statement Tuesday admonishing Trump, saying that calling for impeachment was not an \u201cappropriate\u201d response to a ruling the president didn\u2019t like.\u00a0 \u201cThe president has made it clear that he believes this judge in this case should be impeached. And he has also made it clear that he has great respect for the Chief Justice John Roberts, and its incumbent upon the Supreme Court to rein in these activist judges,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cThese partisan activists are undermining the judicial branch by doing so. We have co-equal branches of government for a reason, and the president feels very strongly about that.\u201d But the main person undermining the power of the federal judiciary is Trump himself, who has decided to claim that any judge who rules against him is a partisan \u201clunatic.\u201d He\u2019s helped by members of his administration who execute his, seemingly more often than not, unlawful wishes.\u00a0 Within the past few days alone, Trump has been hit by an onslaught of legal decisions blocking his administration on everything from DOGE\u2019s mass firing of probationary workers\u00a0to\u00a0the dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development,\u00a0and the ban on transgender service members in the U.S. military, to name a few.\u00a0 During a tense hearing Monday, Boasberg had succinctly summarized the Trump administration\u2019s position on his order, and the rule of law more generally, as \u201cWe don\u2019t care, we\u2019ll do what we want.\u201d Democrats aren\u2019t so sure that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer should continue to front the party. Several Democratic lawmakers in the House of Representatives believe that the New York lawmaker should \u201cstep down\u201d after he pushed his caucus to back the GOP budget resolution Friday.  They include Illinois Representative Delia Ramirez and Maryland Representative Glenn Ivey. \u201cI\u2019ve got no personal beef with Schumer, I think he\u2019s a talented guy, but for me the bigger question is: Is he going to do this again?\u201d Ivey told Axios Wednesday, looking toward the next government funding deadline in September. \u201cWhen this comes back up in six months, is he going to take the same approach or not? If he\u2019s still on that track, I\u2019m for moving on.\u201d But Ivey and Ramirez\u2019s colleagues believe that more lawmakers interested in a Schumer resignation are hiding in the woodwork. \u201cI think there are some already there but just haven\u2019t been asked directly or avoided the question,\u201d an anonymous House Democrat told Axios. The progressive group Indivisible called on Schumer to \u201cstep aside\u201d on Saturday, accusing him of having \u201csurrendered leverage\u201d while handing Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and their congressional allies the keys to dismantle government agencies and public services. Schumer, along with eight other Democrats in the upper chamber, voted in favor of a budget that will strip billions from Medicaid in order to pay for an extension to Trump\u2019s 2017 tax plan, a proposal that overwhelmingly benefits corporations and is projected to add as much as $15 trillion to the national deficit.  Republicans could not have passed the short-term budget without their help. Schumer saw the vote as a potential salve on the eve of a government shutdown that he and his allies believed would temporarily hand Trump more control. House Democrats, including former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, strongly disagreed, arguing that the party should instead have pushed for an extension that would give them more time to negotiate the details of the resolution. Frustration has apparently bubbled all the way to the top. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries dodged a question last week on Schumer\u2019s future, though by Tuesday, he clarified that he still believes Schumer should be involved in Democratic leadership. Medicaid insures more than 70 million Americans. The popular social program, established in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson, represents nearly $1 out of every $5 spent on health care in the U.S. It pays for more than 41 percent of births in America, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, and is the largest financier of nursing home care in the country, according to HuffPost. The White House made a confusing claim on Wednesday: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is welcoming American ownership of his country\u2019s nuclear and electric power plants. Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt proudly announced the news during a press briefing. On their call, Trump and Zelenskiy \u201cdiscussed Ukraine\u2019s electrical supply and nuclear power plants,\u201d Leavitt said, according to CBS News\u2019s Jennifer Jacobs. \u201cHe said that the United States could be very helpful in running those plants. With his electricity and utility expertise, American ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure.\u2019\u201d This development leaves many more questions than answers. Why would Zelenskiy make this ask? And what would American ownership actually look like: boots on the ground? Is Trump done being obsessed with the rare earths? All these questions and more remain unanswered as Trump has yet to comment on the statement.  Rattling America\u2019s longest-standing alliances is starting to cost the U.S. military industrial complex. U.S. arms makers were shut out of the European Union\u2019s enormous defense spending plan released Wednesday.  \u201cWe must buy more European. Because that means strengthening the European defense technological and industrial base,\u201d said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The U.K. was similarly frozen out of the deal. Instead, the EU tapped South Korea and Japan to join the military program, which aims to spend more than $800 billion by 2030 as the bloc prepares for potential conflict with Russia. \u201cWe need to see not only Russia as a threat, but also \u2026 more global geopolitical developments and where Americans will put their strategic attention,\u201d said European Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius, according to Politico. The sales pitch from American arms manufacturers simply isn\u2019t as persuasive as it was under previous administrations. For decades, purchasing American fighter jets and weapons came with an added bonus of U.S. protection. But as global leaders have witnessed Donald Trump defy long-standing military treatises and aggress U.S. allies, that promise no longer feels like a guarantee. Trump\u2019s shocking hostility toward Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy during critical peace negotiations, his nonsensical trade war, his threats to annex Greenland, his whiplash decisions to suspend and un-suspend military resources and intelligence with Kyiv, and his insistence on making Canada the nation\u2019s fifty-first state have all called the reliability of American protection into question. And European nations aren\u2019t the only ones thinking of nixing their American contracts. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Wednesday that he was reviewing a $13.3 billion contract from 2023 for dozens of Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 Lightning II stealth fighters for \u201cgeopolitical\u201d reasons, as well as \u201cthe possibility of having substantial production of alternative aircraft in Canada.\u201d Portugal announced similar plans last week, apparently wobbling on whether it would replace its aging air force with American made products. \u201cAn important factor in the purchase of the F-35 by European governments was the idea that European defense would be built on a transatlantic basis in terms of strategy, institutions, and capabilities,\u201d Gesine Weber, a Paris-based fellow at the transatlantic think tank, German Marshall Fund, told Politico Wednesday. Weber further noted that Trump\u2019s intention to overhaul NATO makes the purchase of American arms systems \u201cno longer have any added value for Europeans.\u201d  Other defense experts who spoke with the publication were more candid. \u201cIf you keep punching your allies in the face, eventually they\u2019re going to stop wanting to buy weapons from you,\u201d an anonymous Western European defense official told Politico. \u201cRight now we have limited options outside of U.S. platforms, but in the long run? That could change in the coming decades if this combativeness keeps up.\u201d  Foreign sales are crucial to the U.S. arms industry. Historically, two-thirds of EU defense spending has gone to American contractors. Losing that could have ramifications for the U.S. economy. But despite the Trump agenda, U.S. arms makers are still hoping that the looming threat of war will leave foreign nations with few other options than to buy their goods. Countries that surround Russia, including Poland and Romania, are still rushing to scoop up as many rockets, artillery, tanks, and warplanes into their arsenals as they can. In December, NATO Chief Mark Rutte told the military alliance that it was time for Europe to \u201cshift to a wartime mindset.\u201d \u201cRussia is preparing for long-term confrontation, with Ukraine and with us,\u201d Rutte said, urging NATO members to \u201cturbocharge\u201d defense production and spending. \u201cWe are not ready for what is coming our way in four to five years.\u201d","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Consulting giant Accenture indicated the Elon Musk-led initiative to cull federal government spending may hurt the company\u2019s performance, tanking its share price following an otherwise in-line quarterly earnings report. Shares of Accenture are down 15% this year. On the Thursday morning earnings call, Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said in her opening statement the \u201cnew administration has a clear goal to run the federal government more efficiently,\u201d noting new government business acquisition has \u201cslowed, which is negatively impacting our sales and revenue,\u201d referring to Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency specifically honing in on contracts between the government and consultants like Accenture and rivals Booz Allen Hamilton and Deloitte. Revenue from work for the federal government accounted for 8% of Accenture\u2019s $65 billion in revenue globally and 16% of its Americas revenue during its most recent fiscal year, Sweet noted. Accenture\u2019s revenue and earnings for the quarter ending last month and its revenue forecast for the ongoing period all came within 0.5% of consensus analyst forecasts, according to FactSet, but its stock tanked. Accenture stock fell 7% to $301 Thursday, registering its lowest share price since July as it lost close to $15 billion in market capitalization. Shares of other public companies with consulting contracts reportedly targeted by DOGE also slumped, as Booz Allen Hamilton and IBM stocks fell 8% and 4%, respectively. Thursday was Accenture stock\u2019s steepest daily loss since last March and its fifth-worst day of the last decade. \u201cWhile DOGE and related cost initiatives may impact Federal IT investments near-term, we do not see any change in the secular need for the US government to modernize and use technology to increase efficiency,\u201d Stifel analyst David Grossman wrote in a Thursday note to clients. Grossman maintained his buy rating for Accenture stock, but trimmed his price target from $380 to $355. Shares of Accenture are down nearly 15% year-to-date, ranking among the S&P 500\u2019s worst 60 performers. Accenture has about 10,000 employees in its unit dedicated to federal government work, according to Bloomberg. Government workers were required last week to review the need for contracts with Accenture and nine of the other highest-paid government consultants, multiple outlets reported. Accenture\u2019s federal government segment grew at twice as fast a pace as the company\u2019s broader business from 2019 to 2024, according to Mizuho analysts Dan Dolev and Sean Kennedy. About half of Accenture\u2019s revenue from the U.S. government comes from application services, according to Mizuho.  One Community.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"ByClem Chambers  ByClem Chambers,  Senior Contributor.  NASDAQ Stock Market Concept with Financial Bar Chart. 3D Render You can be a fundamentalist, a chartist, or both. In my case, I can now be both, as both perspectives point in the same direction. Anyone who has been reading my pieces on Forbes for the past 20 years or so will know that I\u2019m neither a perma-bull nor a perma-bear. I adapt to market conditions. After crashes, I\u2019m a bull; when the market enters pre-crash mode, I turn bearish. I have a solid track record \u2013 feel free to check it. I mention this as a preamble because all I see ahead are market crashes. Even the latest news of the Federal Reserve slowing its QT to a trickle is hardly good news, despite the market\u2019s initial positive reaction as of March 19, 2025. Late last year, I expected the Nasdaq to experience a final bubble rally before derailing. Initially, I thought that would happen a year or two from now, but I now believe the crash is imminent. It\u2019s a bold call, and I hope I\u2019m wrong, but to be clear \u2013 I\u2019m entirely out of the U.S. market. Most of my positions are closed, with some pivoting toward defensive assets, special situations, and precious metals. I hate being in cash, but that\u2019s where I primarily am. We are now at a critical point for the Nasdaq. To provide some context, we live in a chaotic world where the future is obscured by impenetrable fog. The stock market behaves similarly \u2013 there's a 50\/50 chance that you are halfway through your journey, whether moving up or down. If you doubt this, go argue with a math professor. If you accept this premise, then consider the following chart as a coin flip: he Nasdaq chart: is it halfway to where it's going? The cause of this downturn is up for debate, but the driving force behind this correction is not disappearing. You don\u2019t have to believe it now \u2013 you just have to observe what happens next. If the trajectory continues, you can make an educated guess about the destination. I have found this simple analysis highly profitable in the past. If you examine previous market movements \u2013 indices or individual stocks \u2013 you\u2019ll see this pattern repeatedly on both the way up and the way down. This phenomenon is driven by stochastic processes, which are ever-present in a highly random market. For this downturn to reverse, something substantial must intervene. Without that, we are in a long-term bear market until further notice. That concerns me because I\u2019m not a short-seller, and bear markets are notoriously difficult to profit from. Like it or not, geopolitics is now driving the markets. Why else have U.S. military stocks been declining for months while European ones have been rising? Apparently, enough investors perceive a rift between U.S. and European defense interests. Who knew? Defense stocks: U.S. decling, European rising  Maybe I need a tinfoil hat. Nonetheless, this presents a slim yet noteworthy profit opportunity. Hedge funds are, unsurprisingly, going to hedge \u2013 at least many of them. If the market continues to decline, long positions will have to be closed, and consequently, so will short positions. This means that any stocks shorted against the Mag7 will likely rebound. The underdogs will rise, and the high-flyers will stumble. In the U.S. this hedging is likely to concentrate on long term government bonds. For a private investor, trading that is not necessarily a fat opportunity to make money. However, there are bound to be stocks in the U.S. that will pop in a drop and they will be the short legs of hedges. Look out for them and if you fancy trading the storm without being short, that\u2019s where to look. In the U.K., this phenomenon applies to life insurers. In the U.S., it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on stocks like Exxon \u2013 natural short targets for hedge funds that have been riding trillion-dollar tech stocks: The Exxon chart - a natural target for shorters Pay attention to big oil and other obvious long-term short candidates: The BA chart is another short candidate The Federal Reserve has now decided to dramatically slow its QT and is warning of a heightened risk of stagflation. This isn\u2019t \u2018bad news that\u2019s good news\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s simply bad news. At least for now, the liquidity drain dragging on the market has been significantly slowed, and the Fed is showing it cares. However, this merely reflects the mounting strain on the economy and markets due to rising geopolitical instability \u2013 an issue that isn\u2019t going away. I wish it would, so I could return to my preferred strategy of investing in fundamentally strong companies with low valuations. However, the Federal Reserve can only do so much.

Phil Knight, a track athlete at the University of Oregon, and his coach Bill Bowerman teamed up to import high-quality running shoes from Japan\u2019s Onitsuka Tiger (now Asics) to sell in the U.S. market. Knight sold these shoes out of his car at track meets, while Bowerman contributed his expertise by experimenting with innovative shoe designs. By 1966, BRS had opened its first retail store in Santa Monica, California, and expanded operations to the East Coast. However, disagreements with Onitsuka Tiger led the company to rebrand as Nike in 1971, adopting the now-iconic Swoosh logo designed by Carolyn Davidson. The launch of Nike marked a turning point for the company. In 1972, Nike introduced its first original shoe featuring Bowerman's revolutionary \"waffle sole,\" inspired by a waffle iron, which enhanced traction and durability. The company gained momentum throughout the 1970s and introduced its patented Air technology in 1979, setting it apart from competitors. The 1980s solidified Nike's dominance with high-profile endorsements, most notably Michael Jordan in 1984. The Air Jordan line became a cultural phenomenon, blending performance and style. Nike also debuted its \"Just Do It\" slogan in 1988, further embedding itself into popular culture and sports. Today, Nike is a global leader in sportswear and innovation, headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon. It has expanded beyond footwear into apparel, equipment, and digital technology like Nike+, which integrates fitness tracking with wearable devices. With a focus on sustainability through initiatives like Flyknit technology and recycled materials, Nike continues to adapt to modern demands while maintaining its legacy as a brand synonymous with athletic excellence and innovation. NIKE, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, engages in the design, development, marketing, and sale of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and services worldwide. The company provides athletic and casual footwear, apparel, and accessories under the NIKE, Jumpman, Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron, and Jack Purcell trademarks. It also sells a line of performance equipment and accessories comprising bags, sport balls, socks, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves, protective equipment, and other equipment for sports activities under the NIKE brand; and various plastic products to other manufacturers. In addition, the company markets apparel with licensed college and professional team, and league logos, as well as sells sports apparel; licenses unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell apparel, digital devices, and applications and other equipment for sports activities under NIKE-owned trademarks; and operates digital platforms, including fitness and activity apps; sport, fitness, and wellness content; and digital services and features in retail stores. It sells its products to footwear stores; sporting goods stores; athletic specialty stores; department stores; skate, tennis, and golf shops; and other retail accounts through NIKE-owned retail stores, digital platforms, independent distributors, licensees, and sales representatives. The company was founded in 1964 and is headquartered in Beaverton, Oregon. From where I sit, the most important trait I look for during earnings season is how the market and a specific company reacts to the news. Remember, always keep your losses small and never argue with the tape. Disclosure: The stock has been featured on FindLeadingStocks.com.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Business Insider Edition  The US Navy wants to know if roughly motorcycle-sized drones can do what its larger piloted workhorse helicopter and tiltrotor aircraft are currently doing \u2014 flying critical repair cargo out to broken warships.          Critical repair parts for incapacitated warships, such as circuit boards, o-rings, or pumps, around half the timeweigh less than a pound. The current delivery approach wastes fuel and other resources and puts a lot of unnecessary wear and tear on Military Sealift Command's H-60 and V-22 aircraft.               No one really needs a heavy, crewed aircraft for this. There just isn't a proven alternative, at least not yet.               Solving that problem \u2014 the main focus of the Navy's BlueWater Maritime Logistics UAS project \u2014 is a major opportunity for defense tech firms like Colorado-based PteroDynamics Inc.               \"Something is valuable. It needs to get somewhere that is hard to get to. It has to get there quickly. It's time-sensitive. And people are paying a lot of money today to do that mission,\" PteroDynamics CEO Matthew Graczyk, told Business Insider.               The company recently picked up a $4.65 million contract expansion from the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division for the development of its novel Transwing aircraft design, bringing the total contract value to over $7 million. The new funding will support development of a new Transwing model, the P5.               Multiple companies have contributed BlueWater UAS ideas, many of which are variations of classic designs. The Transwing, as an articulating- or \"cracking-wing\" design, is unique.               It's a \"very interesting design,\" the BlueWater project lead, Bill Macchione, told BI, explaining that the aim as the Navy evaluates uncrewed vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) designs is to find innovations with reduced complexity both in the engineering and employment.               \"That is what was very interesting about the PteroDynamics design being an articulating wing,\" he said. It's a \"simple linear actuator that basically just articulates the wings on a pivot, and those pushers, those traditional propellers in fixed wing, become the lift propellers in VTOL mode.\"               The first VTOL aircraft designs were early helicopters. Then came designs like lift jets, tail-sitter aircraft, and tilt rotors. PteroDynamics has now patented a new design that leverages the propellers in all flight modes and can fold the wings around the fuselage.               Its wings stretch out in the cruise phase of flight and fold back during vertical flight to a configuration resembling a quadcopter during take-off and landing.               Graczyk calls the Transwing design \"VTOL 3.0.\"               The unique design came from Val Petrov, a mathematician, chemist, and expert in nonlinear dynamics who spent years in asset and capital management before founding PteroDynamics. He was not an aviation engineer, but he was, as Graczyk told BI, a \"tinkerer.\"               \"When you ask someone who is educated in a field, who has worked in a field, how to solve a problem, they go into how they've been taught to solve the problem,\" Graczyk said, and you ultimately end up with a variation of an existing design.               \"When you ask a guy who has not been taught how to solve the problem, that's where innovation lives,\" he said, telling BI that is the key to making something new. \"That's where disruption happens. That is how Petrov was able to conceive of this Transwing that didn't come from Airbus or Lockheed or Raytheon or Boeing.\"               Whether the PteroDynamics design is what the Navy ultimately needs remains to be seen, but the service is interested.               Some of the other uncrewed aircraft designs being looked at and tested by the Navy as part of the BlueWater program include Skyways V2.6, ShieldAI's V-BAT, and Sierra Nevada Corporation's Voly-50, among others featuring their own innovations.               The Navy's BlueWater UAS technology development program started years ago, evolving from a 2018 study that found about 48% of all critical repair cargo being flown out to ships by Military Sealift Command aircraft is under 16 ounces, smaller than a regular water bottle. The study found that 76% of all parts are under 10 pounds, and 90% are under 50 pounds.               The Navy is interested in determining whether VTOL drones weighing under 330 pounds can run these delivery missions instead of crewed aircraft.               The drones have to be able to fly 400 nautical miles round trip, perhaps eventually 1,000 miles, on a mixture of electricity and JP-5 fuel with a 50-pound payload stored internally and land on the deck of a moving ship at sea without any support infrastructure and minimal sailor involvement.               Using small drones can lead to big cost savings. Each\u00a0Sikorsky SH-60\/MH-60 Seahawk\u00a0costs over $30 million and requires two fully trained and proficient human pilots. There are also the operational and sustainment costs to consider.               In the drones, there also has to be a certain degree of autonomy.               This is \"not the kind of thing where somebody is sitting with a controller in their hand and controlling the aircraft,\" Graczyk said of the Transwing. \"You lay out your mission on a computer, so just one laptop, an operator, and an aircraft, that's all you need, and you communicate the mission to the aircraft. You push go, and it takes off, does the mission, and lands. You don't have to be involved anymore.\"               \"To a certain extent, it can make decisions on its own,\" he said.               Getting a drone to fly that mission is nothing like Amazon drone deliveries. Amazon doesn't have to worry about adversaries trying to shoot them down or jam their communications. And there is also no need to land it on a moving target in an unforgiving delivery environment.               \"Landing on ships and working around ships is not easy,\" John Bruening, the director of MSC's Taluga Group, told BI.               Meeting the tough operational expectations of the Navy's BlueWater technology development program is a complex technological challenge that the Navy has been working with a range of companies to overcome. The project is not yet a program of record and is experimental for now. Still, this is clearly where military technology is heading.               \"The world is changing,\" Graczyk said. \"We're seeing geopolitics changing, we're seeing the way warfare is conducted changing, and the way diplomacy is conducted, all of that's changing. There is a particular shift in bias toward higher volume, lower cost autonomous systems that are attritable, that are expendable.\"               There are tremendous possibilities and \"an evolutionary introduction into the market\" is the key, he said. \"We're trying to use this revolutionary technology to solve problems that exist today.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"After much speculation in recent months, the Google Pixel 9a has finally been announced. Google\u2019s Pixel A series is an excellent choice for those seeking a reliable Android smartphone at a lower price point, and the latest model follows this trend. While it is undeniably part of the Google Pixel 9 series, it has fewer features than its higher-end counterparts. One question you might have when considering the Pixel 9a is whether it comes with a charger. We\u2019ve got the answer The short answer is that the Pixel 9a does not have a charger. This has become common practice for most smartphones today, including other models in the Pixel 9 series, like the Pixel 9 Pro. While this may be disappointing, it\u2019s not surprising. The Pixel 9a supports charging speeds of up to 23W, which are relatively slow compared to other devices on the market. However, this speed should be adequate for a decent charge, even if the phone is plugged in for a short time. To optimize the 9a\u2019s battery performance, it is recommended to use a charging adapter that supports at least 23W. If you don\u2019t have a charging brick available, there\u2019s no need to worry; the Pixel 9a also supports wireless charging. While convenient, wireless charging is slower at 7.5W. Nonetheless, it can help users get the most out of the 9a\u2019s battery. Although the Pixel 9a does not include a charger in the box, it includes a helpful accessory: a USB-C cable. To start charging, you\u2019ll just need an existing (or new) adapter. Fortunately, USB-C wall adapters are widely available. If you own a smartphone from the past several years that is not an iPhone, your existing charging block should be compatible with the Pixel 9a. The Google Pixel 9a\u00a0 represents a pleasant update to Google\u2019s A-series. This mid-range smartphone aims to deliver value by incorporating features from the flagship Pixel 9 series at a more accessible price point. A notable aspect of the Pixel 9a is its use of Google\u2019s TensoGoogle\u2019sp, which enhances its AI capabilities and overall performance. The phone features a redesigned camera module, moving away from the traditional camera bar. Additionally, the device includes an improved display, a more robust battery, and enhanced camera features, such as AI-powered photography tools. With a focus on user experience, the Pixel 9a seeks to appeal to those looking for a feature-rich smartphone at a competitive price. The Google Pixel 9a is here and it has a brand new look, some new features, a tempting price, and a very tough time ahead of it. The curvy shape of the Google Pixel 8a has gone, replaced by a flat rear panel and flat sides. Not only that, but the iconic Pixel visor-style camera module has disappeared too, and the two cameras have been integrated into the back of the phone. That\u2019s right, there\u2019s no camera bump at all, making it look very unusual in 2025. Whether you already miss the best design Google has ever come up with on its phones will be down to your personal taste, but if you get the Pixel 9a in the right color, it\u2019ll still make a statement. Along with the ordinary Porcelain and Obsidian (white and black to you and me) models, there are two eye-catching versions: the purple Iris and the red-pink Peony. The Pixel 9a has an IP68 dust and water resistance rating, the rear is made from plastic, and the chassis is aluminum. Google\u2019s next mid-range smartphone in the Pixel-A series is reportedly right around the corner. Unsurprisingly, Google has done a poor job of keeping the leaks in check. The latest one gives a full-fledged video review treatment to the upcoming Pixel 9a, diving deep into its hardware, specs, and performance based on real-life testing. The video comes courtesy of tech influencer Sahil Karoul, and shows the phone in a light pink shade. In the video, Karoul mentions two storage variants \u2014 128GB and 256GB \u2014 for the Pixel 9a. The packaging is nearly identical to the mainline Pixel 9 series phones, which also means there is no charging brick in the box. Those bezels are an eyesore With Apple, Samsung, and OnePlus releasing their initial rounds of new phones for 2025, attention is shifting to Google, which is expected to announce the Pixel 10 series in the coming months. Today, we have the first leaked images of one of these upcoming devices. Images of the Pixel 10 Pro XL have been revealed courtesy of Android Headlines. This phone features a 6.8-inch display and is expected to resemble its predecessor, the Pixel 9 Pro XL. The leaked dimensions indicate that the new model will measure 162.7 x 76.6 x 8.5 mm, reflecting only a 0.1 mm difference in height compared to the existing model.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"Kiesling is the author of the novels Mobility and The Golden State Kiesling is the author of the novels Mobility and The Golden State In the wake of the 2008 recession, like many recent college graduates at sea amid the wreckage of the U.S. economy, I decided the only way to put myself on any kind of career path was to go to graduate school. Because I had worked in Turkey for a year after college, I applied to master\u2019s programs in Middle Eastern Studies, believing this would bring a linear quality to my haphazard early adulthood. The University of Chicago was the only place that offered me any kind of financial aid: half off an extraordinarily large sum for the first year, with the implication that the second year could be free. So that is where I went, and the second year was free, paid for by the federal government. Because I studied Uzbek, a Turkic language, at one of the few places in America where you can study Uzbek, I got a free year of school at one of the best universities in the country, via something called the Foreign Language Area Studies (FLAS) fellowship. Advertisement Advertisement The FLAS falls, or fell, under the umbrella of the office of International and Foreign Language Education (IFLE), an office within the Department of Education that was functionally dissolved by the Trump Administration this month amid the massive cost cutting overseen by Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). This office funds the Fulbright-Hays programs, which many people have heard of, but it also administers the Title VI program, which funds foreign language and area studies at colleges and universities across the United States. These take the form of FLAS awards and campus-based centers focusing on specific areas of the world. My FLAS and MA program were routed through one such National Resource Center (NRC) at UChicago. My experience there was exhilarating, exposing me to people of incredible erudition even as it revealed some disillusioning things about academic hierarchies. After graduating, though, I found myself in the situation of many millennials who thought that a higher degree would solve their employment issues: in debt for a degree that qualified for me for a job that probably didn\u2019t exist, or, at best, a job that I didn\u2019t want and couldn\u2019t pass a background check for in any case. For several months I sheepishly flung myself into completely unrelated work, until I stumbled across an opening to manage one of these NRCs at UC Berkeley\u2014in many ways the platonic ideal of a job you could do with the kind of degree I had. Read More: Eliminating the Department of Education Would Hurt Black Students Over three years at UC Berkeley, I learned the intricate workings of Title VI, a program that was allotted nearly $2 billion between 2000 and 2024. This was the program that had paid for part of my education, paid for part of the (too-small) salaries of my language instructors and graduate TAs, paid for public events that made the work of university available to people from the surrounding city, and now paid for a portion of my salary. I learned that the Title VI program funded the majority of higher-ed foreign-language study in the U.S., but that it also benefited younger students, primarily through training programs that brought K-12 educators together to develop new curriculum modules with subject-matter experts from the university. Title VI is at its heart a Cold War program, launched after Sputnik as the Defense Education Act of 1958, and incorporated into the Higher Education Act in 1965. Its founding principle was, essentially, Know Your Enemy (read: learn Russian). Although the Department of Defense and the State Department fund some of their own language and area-studies programs, there is no question that many American meddlers and spies have benefited from Title VI. But over time, the program has evolved into something much more generous, and vital, than its original mandate. Once money leaves the federal government and enters the realm of the scholar and the university administrator, its purview stretches, not only to address the constitutional miserliness of our academic institutions, but the curiosity and ambition of their students and faculty. Title VI funds were a particular boon for public universities. There are NRCs all across the country, giving students from many different backgrounds the chance to learn a little bit more about the world. FLAS stipends might support one student learning about Ottoman statecraft, and another studying modern Portuguese literature, and a third studying contemporary South African politics. As such, over time, the Title VI program has become a site of bureaucratic creativity. It\u2019s also been the subject of a long-simmering bureaucratic civil war to determine the best and proper use of taxpayer funds, and to define what constitutes an education.  Read More: How the Supreme Court Paved the Way for DOGE I studied and then worked at a Center for Middle Eastern Studies, and we were under no illusions about the political target on our back. For decades Middle East Studies centers have been maligned as left-wing hotbeds that, in their critics\u2019 view, are excessively hostile to Israel, overly friendly to Islam, and troublingly uninterested in terrorism. Periodically, an inflamed lawmaker would demand an inquiry into the way centers like ours represented the Middle East, charging that they fueled antisemitism by being critical of Israel. Donald Trump\u2019s return is a gift to these efforts, as seen most plainly in his Administration\u2019s letter to Columbia University, demanding that the academic department affiliated with their Title VI-funded Middle East Institute be placed under receivership.\u00a0 DOGE, too, is the culmination of a decades-long effort, a moment of triumph for those in our national apparatus who take an exceedingly narrow and incurious view of what education in this country is for. Given that NRCs are a hub for multidisciplinary efforts at any given host university, they are threatened whenever a congressperson opposed to the very principle of a humanistic education deigns to notice them. The grant process, every four years, is thus an exercise in contorting the natural activities of these centers to fit the U.S. government\u2019s rubric, which insists that Title VI exists to prepare students for work in government and \u201cbusiness,\u201d where business is understood to be something important, unlike, for example, poetry. The real enemy of DOGE is not waste and bureaucracy, as Musk claims, but the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake\u2014and the idea that education should be a public good. The people who believe that taxation is theft argue that the market will fill any void left by the Department of Education\u2019s millions. But the market will never decide that Uzbek class is a worthwhile proposition, or that it is important for a K-12 teacher in a cash-strapped district to attend a free symposium on world history.  Read More: Can Young People Afford Not to Go to College? As someone who administered one of these centers and was deep in the grant process, I had plenty of opportunities to thrash in a helpless rage in the three-way bureaucratic web of the federal government, the State of California, and the UC system. There were, indeed, maddening inefficiencies, but many of them were introduced or exacerbated by the private sector (just before my tenure, Bain\u2019s consulting arm charged UC Berkeley millions of dollars to prescribe a shared-services system that, in many employees\u2019 view, made everything just a little harder to do). Free marketeers will advise deans to cut whatever course can\u2019t fill a giant lecture hall or lead to lucrative research grants. To the consultants, language instruction will never pencil out, and it is exceedingly unlikely that the administrators who take their advice can or will fill the void left by the federal government. The dissolution of IFLE within the Department of Education will lead to countless lost jobs and educational opportunities, and an educational landscape denuded of possibility\u2014the possibility of learning a new language, seeing a new place, understanding a new point of view. It is stealing from generations of people. I left my job at UC Berkeley because I had a baby and I wanted to be a writer and I couldn\u2019t make all the math work. I suppose Elon Musk could argue that my story embodies exactly the kind of pointless government largesse that he has been tasked with ferreting out. Why should the taxpayers subsidize the learning of agglutinative grammars by an aimless young woman who became an administrator and then left the nine-to-five workforce to become a novelist?  For what it\u2019s worth, I put what I learned in my books. And writing those books changed my life. Writing one book helped me buy a home. Writing another helped me buy a car. Now I\u2019m 41 and I pay taxes and participate enthusiastically in the consumer economy. But even if my work had nothing to do with what I learned on the government\u2019s dime, that education would still be valuable\u2013priceless, even. If the wrecking crew at DOGE doesn\u2019t understand why, there\u2019s no class in the world that can teach them. Correction, March 20 The original version of this story misstated the period for which Title VI was allotted nearly $2 billion. It was from 2000 to 2024, not the last four-year funding cycle. \u00a9 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said that five Teslas were damaged and believe that the suspect fired three rounds from a firearm at the vehicles and spray painted the word \"RESIST\" on the entrance.                                                           Ethan Miller\/Getty Images                                       hide caption  The Department of Justice announced charges Thursday against three people it says are allegedly responsible for violent incidents targeting Elon Musk's Tesla cars, showrooms and charging stations across the country. The Justice Department says three people \u2014 in Charleston, S.C., Loveland, Colo., and Salem, Ore. \u2014 are facing criminal charges that carry a minimum penalty of five years and up to 20 years in prison for a range of violent acts. They include using Molotov cocktails to set fire to Tesla cars and charging stations and possessing other \"incendiary devices\" and a suppressed AR-15 rifle, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement Thursday.  \"The days of committing crimes without consequence have ended,\" Bondi said. \"Let this be a warning: if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.\"                  President Trump and White House senior adviser, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk deliver remarks next to a Tesla Model S on the South Lawn of the White House on March 11 in Washington, D.C.                                                           Andrew Harnik\/Getty Images                                       hide caption  The strong statement came less than two days after Bondi promised that such attacks on Tesla also would be considered \"nothing short of domestic terrorism.\" A representative for the DOJ didn't immediately respond to NPR's additional questions on what the agency plans to do next on this issue.  Trump, for his part, has criticized the attacks and efforts to boycott Musk's companies and, last week, said he would purchase a Tesla vehicle to support his advisor. In Las Vegas, police said Tuesday that five Teslas were damaged in an attack on a sales and service center. Police believe the suspect also shot a gun at the cars and spray-painted the word \"RESIST\" on the entrance. No one was injured, which was also the case in the Colorado, Oregon and South Carolina incidents. While no one has been injured or killed by these attacks, three professors and researchers of domestic terrorism and extremism tell NPR that they consider these cases to be acts of domestic terrorism. \"It's absolutely domestic terrorism. I know that may discomfort many people. But vandalism is a crime that if it's committed with a political motive, can certainly be defined as terrorism,\" says Bruce Hoffman, senior fellow for counterterrorism and homeland security at the Council on Foreign Relations. He is the co-author of the forthcoming book, God, Guns, and Sedition: Far-Right Terrorism in America. These days, the concept of domestic terrorism has become increasingly complex, Hoffman says. While there are official definitions of domestic terrorism, there is no federal law on the matter. Here's a breakdown of what constitutes domestic terrorism,  how the U.S. has approached this issue in the past, and why it's important despite the lack of a specific law.   Public anger toward Musk, a White House advisor, Tesla and SpaceX CEO and one of the world's richest men, is growing as he leads efforts to slash government spending with his Department of Government Efficiency team. So far, this Trump administration entity has orchestrated the mass firings of thousands of government workers across multiple agencies in the past month. In response, a grassroots protest has emerged in the form of the #TeslaTakedown movement. It is calling on Tesla drivers to sell their cars, dump company stock and join picket lines at Tesla showrooms.                   People protesting Musk's actions in the Trump administration hold signs outside a Tesla showroom in Seattle on Feb. 13                                                           Manuel Valdes\/AP                                       hide caption  But in some cases \u2014 including one of the people included in Bondi's announcement Thursday \u2014 the protests have taken a more violent turn. Two people have been arrested and are now facing state and federal charges tied to two separate attacks on a Tesla dealership in Loveland, Colo., which involved throwing Molotov cocktails at the cars and, in one instance, spray-painting expletive-ridden messages on the showroom's windows. No one was killed or injured during either incident.  Lucy Grace Nelson, Daniel Brendan Kurt Clarke-Pounder and Adam Matthew Lansky are facing charges tied to their alleged vandalism of Tesla cars and dealerships in Colorado, South Carolina and Oregon, respectively. Nelson is facing two charges of possession of an unregistered firearm and the malicious (attempted) destruction of property. She could face up to 30 years in prison. Court documents allege that Nelson traveled to a Tesla dealership in Loveland, Colo., on multiple nights in January and February, allegedly lighting Molotov cocktails and throwing them in the dealership's parking lot and spraying graffiti on the building's windows and walls. Nelson's attorney, Mary V. Butterton, declined to comment on her client's case. Lansky is facing one charge of unlawful possession of an unregistered firearm. But an affidavit alleges he is also responsible for throwing Molotov cocktails and shooting a gun at Tesla vehicles and dealership facilities in Salem, Ore., on at least two separate occasions in January and February. Lansky's attorney, Mark Patrick Ahlemeyer, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Court documents allege that witnesses say they saw Clarke-Pounder on March 7 using red spray paint to write obscenities against Trump and \"Long Live Ukraine\" on a Tesla charging station parking spot in North Charleston, S.C. Clarke-Pounder then allegedly started lighting bottles on fire and throwing them at the Tesla charging stations, according to court documents. He's facing one charge of arson affecting interstate commerce. Patrick Chisum, Clarke-Pounder's attorney, told NPR that Clarke-Pounder is feeling overwhelmed.  \"He's being accused of something that's very, very serious. And I think that the realization of how serious it's being taken, especially with Attorney General Bondi's statements, is kind of becoming self-evident. Both he and his family are very, very concerned and very scared,\" Chisum said. He added that his client \"is a troubled young man who's been suffering from multiple mental health issues.\" The U.S. doesn't have a stand-alone federal domestic terrorism law. But at least 32 states and Washington, D.C., have their own state-level domestic terrorism laws. The FBI defines domestic terrorism as, \"Violent, criminal acts committed by individuals and\/or groups to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences, such as those of a political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.\" People might look at vandalism at a Tesla dealership and question whether it's terrorism, says Hoffman.  But going back to the 1990s, the FBI, as the lead agency responsible for investigating terrorism in the United States, has investigated acts of vandalism and arson like those committed by eco-terrorism groups and treated them as domestic terrorism, he says.  One of the more famous cases of eco-terrorism was committed by the group known as The Family. The FBI says the group has been linked to more than 40 criminal acts between 1995 and 2001, including arson and vandalism, causing more than $45 million in damages. The group's most notorious act was the 1998 arson attack on a ski resort in Vail, Colo. \u2014 which caused around $26 million in damages.  \"To me, regardless of one's opinions of Tesla cars, and its owner, this isn't new,\" Hoffman says.  A key element in determining what is domestic terrorism is the intent of the perpetrator. That can include a desire to intimidate or coerce a civilian population, influence government policy, or affect government conduct, says Faiza Patel, senior director of the Brennan Center For Justice's Liberty and National Security Program. And the intent of the Tesla vandals falls under this umbrella, she says.  \"The whole point ... is that [the vandals] are trying to influence government conduct. Everybody knows that Elon Musk is not only a federal employee, but is at the center of a lot of controversies about what the government is doing right now,\" Patel says. The act would also have to fall under one of the laws listed in the federal code as a domestic terrorism offense. These include attacks that use certain types of weapons \u2014 for example, weapons of mass destruction \u2014 or include acts such as hostage-taking or involve special federal interest, such as attacks on federal officials. Other protesters have spray-painted swastikas and smashed windows of Tesla showrooms. But Patel says it's unlikely authorities will consider those cases of petty vandalism \u2014 or of someone keying a Tesla \u2014 to be domestic terrorism.                  Investigators look over the scene at a Tesla Collision Center after a person set several vehicles on fire on Tuesday in Las Vegas.                                                           Ethan Miller\/Getty Images                                       hide caption  Extremism experts have long warned that domestic terrorism, mainly coming from far-right and white supremacy groups, posed a far greater threat than foreign terrorism. Still, despite sporadic efforts to do so, no federal domestic terrorism law has been created due to a lack of consensus. Because of this, people involved in acts determined to be domestic terrorism are still just charged with offenses such as arson, murder, kidnapping and assault.  The perpetrators of the most famous incident of U.S. domestic terrorism, the Oklahoma City Bombing that killed 168 people, were never actually charged with domestic terrorism. Rather, Timothy McVeigh and his co-conspirator Terry L. Nichols were found guilty of several counts of murder and the use of a weapon of mass destruction or conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction.  Although there is no federal domestic terrorism law, prosecutors can point to a perpetrator's motive to classify a crime as terrorism during a trial and sentencing, which can affect a convicted person's punishment, says Laura Dugan, a professor of human security and professor of sociology at The Ohio State University. If a crime is determined to be an act of terrorism, a perpetrator could receive additional years on their sentence. Even after the Oklahoma City bombing, there was never enough agreement in Congress to support a domestic terrorism law, Hoffman says. It was always considered a highly politicized issue, he says. \"When you walked into a room going back to the 1990s and you talked about domestic terrorism there was a half of the room that immediately thought far-left radicals. And there was another half of the room that immediately thought white supremacists or seditious-minded conspiracy [believers],\" Hoffman says.  Hoffman believes it's \"a huge problem\" that the U.S. has no domestic terrorism statute. But Patel, whose Brennan Center has long opposed such a law, says this would only be weaponized by the federal government and would make it too easy for \"an administration to label unpopular groups or political enemies as a domestic terrorist outfit.\" \"I don't see how it benefits anybody,\" she says. \"Given how polarized our current political environment is, it seems to me a particularly bad idea.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt struggled Thursday to justify Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick\u2019s shilling for Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla.  During an appearance on Fox News Wednesday, Lutnick had urged viewers to buy stock in the Trump ally\u2019s electric vehicle company because it \u201cwill never be this cheap again.\u201d  \u201cI mean who wouldn\u2019t invest in Elon Musk, you gotta be kidding me!\u201d Lutnick said.  Notably, Cabinet members do not typically endorse products, as the Code of Federal Regulations states that \u201cpublic servants are generally barred from using their office\u2019s platform to endorse companies and products.\u201d The next day, Leavitt was asked whether Lutnick\u2019s recommendation to buy Tesla stock was the \u201cstance of the administration.\u201d \u201cI think the commerce secretary was reiterating that the president supports an American-made company, like Tesla, who produces a very good product for the American people, which was beloved by the American people\u2014particularly Democrats\u2014until Elon Musk decided to vote for Donald Trump,\u201d Leavitt said.  But Musk didn\u2019t just vote for Trump, he threw billions behind his presidential campaign and was rewarded with a fake Cabinet position at the head of the Department of Government Efficiency. While Musk initially enjoyed a postelection \u201cTrump bump,\u201d his stock has only suffered as he unleashed DOGE on the federal government, rifling through citizens\u2019 private information, slashing essential programs, and hastily cutting massive swaths of the federal workforce.  A CNN poll found that 53 percent of Americans now hold a negative view of the billionaire bureaucrat\u2014with only 35 percent holding a positive view. As public perception of Musk has cratered, so too have Tesla shares fallen. Tesla stock was down 5 percent over the last five days, 35 percent over the last month, and 42 percent since January, shedding nearly $121 billion of Musk\u2019s personal net worth.  Leavitt then shifted topics slightly, expounding on what a \u201cscary time\u201d it was for Tesla owners amid a spate of vandalism incidents and widespread protests at dealerships. \u201cAnd now we\u2019ve seen despicable and unacceptable violence taking place across our country at Tesla dealerships, against workers, employees, and also innocent Americans who drive these vehicles,\u201d Leavitt said.  While Donald Trump, who held a surreal press event for Tesla at the White House last week, may be exempt from federal conflict of interest laws, Lutnick probably isn\u2019t. And the Code of Federal Regulations specifically prohibits public officials from using their office for private gain. Cantor Fitzgerald, the financial services firm once run by Lutnick but now helmed by his children, also upgraded Tesla stock Wednesday, citing a buying opportunity. It seems Lutnick may be trying to rescue Musk\u2019s falling stock to the benefit of his family business, as Cantor Fitzgerald held roughly 740,000 shares of Tesla stock at the end of 2024.  Unfortunately for Lutnick and Musk, the commerce secretary\u2019s endorsement didn\u2019t appear to do very much good: Tesla stock dropped 1.7 percent in premarket trading after his appearance on Fox News, as one of Wall Street\u2019s most bullish Tesla advocates warned that Musk\u2019s company was undergoing a \u201ccrisis.\u201d Fox News host Harris Faulkner invented a new crime\u2014\u201cterrorism plus\u201d\u2014for those caught setting Teslas on fire. She thinks the death penalty should be considered in some cases.  Faulkner and Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt reacted to footage of Tesla attacks in Las Vegas on Tuesday with horror, suggesting that if someone was to be hurt in such attacks\u2014they weren\u2019t\u2014then the perpetrator should be charged with \u201cterrorism plus.\u201d  \u201cIf there\u2019s someone in one of these cars and they blow up \u2026 that can happen. That becomes murder. Or worse. Terrorism plus,\u201d Faulkner said. \u201cAnd I know that on January 20, the president signed through an executive order, restoring the death penalty \u2026 this is deadly, dangerous stuff these liberal protesters are playing with.\u201d \u201cIt is, Harris,\u201d Leavitt replied. \u201cAnd what I can tell you is that President Trump condemns this violence and he is determined to restore law and order in our country, and he will ensure that the harshest penalties are pursued for those who are engaging in this vicious violence that we have seen targeted at this American company.\u201d \u2018 Elon Musk himself has been fanning the flames. \u201cIt\u2019s just fully terrorism at this point,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cThis level of violence is insane and deeply wrong,\u201d he continued. \u201cTesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\u201d Musk tellingly depicts the company as fully autonomous, as if no human being\u2014let alone one of the most powerful people on the planet\u2014is responsible for it.  It\u2019s worth noting, moreover, that Faulkner\u2019s \u201cterrorism plus\u201d designation imagines a crime that has not been committed. Property destruction has occurred, but no one has been injured in the nationwide vandalism spree. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has appointed an official from Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency to head USAID\u2014the very same day a federal judge ruled that DOGE could no longer mess around with the federal agency. Now Musk may be able to continue ripping the development organization to shreds.  Jeremy Lewin was appointed Tuesday to lead what remains of USAID, after serving as DOGE\u2019s team lead at the federal agency. In February, DOGE raided USAID\u2019s offices and subsequently laid off up to 50 percent of the agency\u2019s employees while placing the rest on administrative leave. The Trump administration intends to keep fewer than 300 of USAID\u2019s 10,000 employees, four sources told Reuters. Rubio announced earlier this month that a whopping 83 percent of all USAID\u2019s programs had been terminated.  On Tuesday, a federal judge ruled that Musk and DOGE\u2019s efforts to eliminate USAID were likely unconstitutional because they had shuttered the agency without congressional approval, and Congress alone maintains the authority to create or terminate federal agencies. The judge barred DOGE from taking \u201cany actions relating to USAID without the express authorization of a USAID official with legal authority to take or approve the action.\u201d However, the order maintained that actions that were ratified by a USAID official would not be subject to the same restrictions, so as not to \u201cenjoin USAID.\u201d It seems that Lewin\u2019s appointment to USAID might allow them to work around the judge\u2019s order and continue to execute DOGE\u2019s cost-cutting agenda at the already gutted development agency.  In a brief court filing Wednesday, lawyers for Musk and DOGE sought to clarify that the appointment of Lewin, who now has authority over the day-to-day work at USAID, did not constitute more DOGE meddling at USAID.  The lawyers asserted that the decision to appoint Lewin came before the judge\u2019s order, though it was only formally announced on Tuesday. \u201cMr. Lewin surely does not fall within the spirit of this Court\u2019s decision\u2014and Defendants file this motion to ensure he is not wrongfully picked up by its letter,\u201d the lawyers wrote.  Lawyers requested that the judge amend his order so that it specifically did not include Lewin, as \u201cthe injunction may bar him from engaging in a wide range of work he is otherwise authorized\u2014and tasked\u2014to perform. That is untenable.\u201d In a declaration, Lewin claimed that he was no longer affiliated with the defendants subject to the judge\u2019s order. \u201cNone of Elon Musk, USDS, or any USDS employee has any formal authority over me. None has the legal authority to direct me or anyone at USAID,\u201d Lewin said.  Republicans are learning fast that the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s federal cuts are not popular. Representative Harriet Hagemen was booed and chanted down by a crowd of her constituents during a Wyoming town hall Wednesday night as she attempted to defend Elon Musk\u2019s influence over the executive branch. \u201cDOGE is not dismantling Social Security,\u201d Hagemen said as hundreds of people jeered.  The crowd also chanted, \u201cDeport Elon\u201d as Hagemen attempted to explain her work on the Judiciary Committee. Things took a turn for the worse when one woman from the incensed crowd claimed that she was a recently laid-off employee of the Agriculture Department. \u201cIn a state where so many farmers rely on government programs for drought and disaster relief, [Donald] Trump\u2019s plans to cut these programs and the people who administer them, coupled with the tariffs, will decimate Wyoming farms in rural communities,\u201d the woman said as the crowd applauded her. \u201cWhat are you doing about that?\u201d \u201cI disagree,\u201d Hagemen said, once again souring the crowd on her. The Republican lawmaker then went on to accost the irate crowd for challenging her actions, claiming it was \u201cbizarre\u201d to her \u201chow obsessed you are with federal government.\u201d That sent attendees into a rage, with some people screaming, \u201cOh my God!\u201d and expletives at the irony. \u201cCalm down, calm down,\u201d Hagemen continued, laughing. \u201cAll DOGE is doing\u2014you guys are going to have a heart attack if you don\u2019t calm down. Your hysteria is really over the top.\u201d Holy shit. Republican Harriet Hagemen got torn apart at a town hall in Wyoming last night. In a state that voted for Trump by 46 points.  She tried defending DOGE and it went as well as you\u2019d imagine.  \u201cDeport Elon, Deport Elon!\u201d  Watch to the end\u2026[image or embed] Dissenting crowds in deep-red Wyoming should be a warning signal to Republicans around the country. In November, state residents voted to send Trump back to the White House by a whopping 46 percent margin. But on Wednesday, roughly three-quarters of the hostile, 500-person crowd were there to oppose Hagemen and elements of Trump\u2019s agenda, reported the Cowboy State Daily.  Musk has eyed slashes to Social Security. Changes are already underway: By DOGE\u2019s demand, the Social Security Administration is nixing some 7,000 employees, or roughly 12 percent of agency staff, and closing offices around the country. An internal Social Security Administration memo leaked earlier this week proposed changes that could further hamper the agency\u2019s processing abilities for the retirement income program, including altering its phone service to require America\u2019s aging population to verify their identity over the internet rather than by phone for new applications, as has been required.  By acting Deputy Commissioner Doris Diaz\u2019s own estimates, that could send some 75,000 to 85,000 people to Social Security offices in order to access their benefits\u2014which they\u2019ve paid into throughout their working life by way of payroll taxes and are theoretically entitled to. But even before Musk\u2019s involvement, the SSA\u2019s physical offices were already beleaguered with extraordinarily long wait times, forcing Americans to wait months before receiving their benefits. Beyond that, Musk\u2014the world\u2019s richest man\u2014clearly has no affinity for the popular program. In recent weeks, he\u2019s accused Social Security of being the \u201cbiggest Ponzi scheme of all time\u201d and rife with fraud. In order to sell the unsavory cuts to America\u2019s \u201cthird rail\u201d social issue, Musk has hinged Social Security on an immigration conspiracy theory, claiming that Democrats\u2014who failed to win the House, the Senate, or the Oval Office in November\u2014are using \u201centitlements fraud\u201d to stay in power by winning over the votes of undocumented immigrants, a group that (reminder) cannot vote. Republicans in Congress are refusing to hold town halls in their districts out of fear of criticism, and now Democrats are swooping in. In Wisconsin, Representative Derrick Van Orden didn\u2019t show up at a town hall meeting Tuesday in his district in Viroqua, so Democratic Representative Mark Pocan showed up, speaking to 300 people next to an empty chair with Van Orden\u2019s name on it.  \u201cDerrick was a NO SHOW, but over 300 people in the town of 4500 showed up. Empty seat for him,\u201d Pocan posted on X. \u201cOf note: Derrick doesn\u2019t respond to constituents & they don\u2019t like cuts to Medicaid & other programs.\u201d  Van Orden \u201cis afraid of his constituents, and he can be fired in 2026,\u201d Pocan noted in a follow-up post. The Republican congressman plans to switch to virtual town halls, calling protesters at Republican-led town halls \u201cGeorge Soros-funded agitators\u201d and comparing them to Nazis.  Pocan has done this before to Van Orden, mocking the Republican for being \u201con vacation\u201d last month after Van Orden and other Republicans refused to show up at a Wisconsin Farmers Union event where farmers spoke on their concerns with Donald Trump\u2019s policies. And it appears that Democrats elsewhere may soon take a similar approach.  The Democratic National Committee announced Wednesday that it will put up billboards in Republican districts in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, and Pennsylvania telling local residents to push their members of Congress to hold town halls. The billboards will even include these Republicans\u2019 phone numbers.  \u201cRepublicans are refusing to meet with their constituents after voting to take away health care and make it harder for families to put food on the table,\u201d the new chair of the DNC, Ken Martin, said in a statement. \u201cThis isn\u2019t surprising\u2014over the last few months, one word has come to describe Republicans: cowards.\u201d  Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who was Kamala Harris\u2019s running mate in 2024, is also holding events in Republican districts, visiting Eau Claire, Wisconsin, in Van Orden\u2019s district on Tuesday for a \u201cPeople v. Musk\u201d rally following earlier visits to Iowa and Nebraska. Senator Bernie Sanders has held several rallies in Republican territory, and he and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez plan to visit Nevada, Arizona, and Colorado later this week.  Will it help, though? Democrats are currently struggling to come up with an effective plan to fight against Trump and the GOP\u2019s massive overhaul of the federal government. Meanwhile, tech oligarch Elon Musk is throwing millions of dollars into political races to shore up support for the Trump agenda. The Democrats need to grab the attention of an already frustrated electorate and leverage its rage against the GOP.  Repealing the Inflation Reduction Act\u2014something President Trump is currently trying very hard to do\u2014could result in a $160 billion hit to the gross domestic product, according to Semafor.  A complete IRA repeal would devastate the country\u2019s economy. It could lead to 790,000 lost job losses by 2030, while household energy bills would increase by up to $370 per year, on average, by 2035.  This is ominous news for an economy already on the brink of recession. That recession is being driven by Trump\u2019s ongoing trade war with America\u2019s closest allies\u201425 percent levies are currently being placed on many imports from Mexico and Canada\u2014which Fed Chair Jerome Powell just admitted was making inflation worse. Cuts to the IRA would have a massive negative impact on American manufacturing, delivering a devastating blow to a sector that those tariffs are theoretically intended to boost. Slashing the IRA would also particularly harm red states, which have received a whopping 77 percent of clean energy manufacturing and deployment investment since the third quarter of 2022. A full repeal of the IRA is not expected, of course, but Speaker Mike Johnson did describe his vision for the cuts as \u201csomewhere between a scalpel and a sledgehammer.\u201d Even if the bill is not repealed\u2014or curtailed\u2014by Congress, agency cuts made by Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency have likely already affected its implementation.  The National Archives released thousands of declassified documents this week relating to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy\u2014but in its effort to make the unredacted trove public, it published the Social Security numbers of over 200 former congressional staffers. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that buried within the 60,000 pages of mostly unredacted documents were the Social Security numbers of more than 100 staff members of the Senate Church Committee, and more than 100 staff members of the House Select Committee on Assassinations. The names of those who were doxxed include several high-profile figures, including a former assistant secretary of state, a former U.S. ambassador, and several prominent figures in the intelligence and legal fields. \u00a0\u00a0 The Senate Church Committee was formed in 1975 to study the intelligence abuses of federal agencies, and the Committee on Assassinations investigated Kennedy\u2019s death.\u00a0 Joseph diGenova, a former Trump campaign lawyer who previously investigated intelligence abuses in the 1970s, was not aware that his private information was included within the JFK files until the Post reached out to him. He called the move \u201cabsolutely outrageous,\u201d \u201csloppy,\u201d and \u201cunprofessional.\u201d \u201cIt makes sense that my name is in there,\u201d diGenova said. \u201cBut the other sensitive stuff\u2014it\u2019s like a first-grade, elementary-level rule of security to redact things like that.\u201d \u201cIt not only means identity theft, but I\u2019ve had threats against me,\u201d diGenova added.\u00a0 One former Senate staffer, who spoke with the Post under the condition of anonymity, directed their ire at the Trump administration, now that they had become a target for identity theft and fraud.\u00a0 \u201cIt just shows the danger of how this administration is handling these things with no thought of who gets damaged in the process,\u201d they said.\u00a0 Following up on his executive order from January, Trump had promised Monday that all the files related to the assassination would be made public by Tuesday afternoon\u2014setting off a scramble at the Department of Justice to make it happen as quickly as possible. Attorneys in the DOJ\u2019s National Security Division were called to urgently provide a second set of eyes to review the documents for release, even though they had already received an initial review by the FBI.\u00a0 Mary Ellen Callahan, former chief privacy officer at the Department of Homeland Security, told the Post that the mass publication of sensitive information was \u201cabsolutely\u201d a violation of the 1974 Privacy Act, which requires agencies to be careful in their handling of sensitive information.\u00a0 \u201cSocial Security is literally the keys to the kingdom to everybody,\u201d said Callahan. Some of the undocumented immigrants that the Trump administration deported to El Salvador were not hardened criminals or gang members, as it claims, but rather people without criminal records whose gang affiliations are dubious at best.  Linette Tobin, an attorney for detained Venezuelan immigrant Jerce Reyes Barrios, released a sworn statement about the accusations against her client Wednesday night. Reyes Barrios, her statement says, was a professional soccer player in his native country but sought asylum in the United States after being detained and tortured for marching in two political demonstrations against Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.  Reyes Barrios\u2019s petition for asylum was pending, with a hearing scheduled for April, when he was deported March 15 to El Salvador without any notice to his family or attorney. Tobin only was able to reach an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official three days later.  The government accuses Reyes Barrios of being a member of the Tren de Aragua gang based on two \u201cGang Membership Identification Criteria.\u201d The first was a tattoo on his arm of a crown on top of a soccer ball with a rosary and the word \u201cDios,\u201d which is Spanish for \u201cGod.\u201d Reyes Barrios chose this tattoo because it resembles the logo for Spanish soccer team Real Madrid. The second was a social media post with a picture of Reyes Barrios making \u201crock and roll\u201d or \u201cI love you\u201d hand gestures.  Reyes Barrios\u2019s account is one of many sworn statements from immigrants detained and immediately sent off to El Salvador as part of an agreement with the country, without any due process. Some, like Reyes Barrios, were detained merely because they have tattoos that look suspicious to immigration officials but are in fact harmless. Many had pending hearings about their asylum claims.  Secretary of State Marco Rubio has pursued a hard-line immigration policy that disregards due process in favor of swift deportations, cutting a deal with a friendly autocrat in El Salvador\u2019s Nayib Bukele without much in the way of legal justification. Unlike any of President Trump\u2019s other Cabinet picks, Rubio got the vote of every single Senate Democrat in his confirmation. Some Democrats now regret their votes, and it\u2019s easy to see why. Corporate executives are allegedly trying to talk the president \u201coff the ledge\u201d of his tariff plan, according to an ex-Trump official. In an interview with MSNBC Wednesday, former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci claimed that Donald Trump\u2019s weekends are consumed by fearful phone calls from CEOs looking to reverse the clock on the president\u2019s trade war. \u201cRemember, he\u2019s living alone in the White House, Nicolle,\u201d Scaramucci, who was fired after serving just 11 days during Trump\u2019s first term, told host Nicolle Wallace. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for people to understand that there\u2019s nobody there to hand-check him. There\u2019s no family in there. \u201cAnd so he\u2019s taking calls over the weekend from various CEOs that I know that are trying to talk him off the ledge of this sort of stuff,\u201d Scaramucci said. Scaramucci further predicted that Trump\u2019s economic actions won\u2019t only fail to bring manufacturing back to American shores but could also lead to a recession\u2014something that he argued won\u2019t bode well for the president or his allies in upcoming elections. \u201cThe stock market will. I mean, you take the market down another 15 percent, we go into a recession, you\u2019ll flip the Congress, even though the Democrats weren\u2019t really doing so well from an approval rating right now,\u201d said Scaramucci. \u201cYou knock the economy off the grid, the Democrats will be back in power, and that will liquidate some of President Trump\u2019s power. \u201cSo he\u2019s doing this thinking that it\u2019s going to restore manufacturing, but it\u2019s actually going to have the opposite effect, and market participants know this,\u201d Scaramucci said, pointing to the flow of capital into European markets since Trump announced the tariffs. Trump has repeatedly attempted to spin the tariffs to claim that foreign countries will pay the difference on the rising cost of goods, but economists point out that\u2019s not how tariffs work. Instead, Trump\u2019s global tariff war is expected to affect just about every sector of life for the average American. Products that will see prices rise include groceries such as avocados, maple syrup, ground beef, cherry tomatoes, sugar, bananas, nuts, cooking oil, squash, cucumbers, strawberries, and pineapples. The order also had immediate ramifications for countless other business sectors, raising the price on everything from liquor to gas.  Children\u2019s toys, shoes, beer and alcohol, and crude oil were all hit in Trump\u2019s 25 percent tariff hike on Canada and Mexico, alongside an additional 10 percent tariff on China. Car manufacturers BMW, Audi, Nissan, and Mazda were also affected, as was American-owned Ford. And every industry that relies on lumber, aluminum, and steel\u2014from artisan goods to construction\u2014will see markups as the materials themselves become more costly. Four major political organizations focused on young voters\u2014the Sunrise Movement, College Democrats of America, United We Dream of Action, and Voters of Tomorrow\u2014are calling on Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to either stand up to Donald Trump or step down from leadership.  \u201cChuck Schumer, your leadership is failing to meet the moment. Your decision\u2014along with nine other Senate Democrats\u2014to cave and support the MAGA budget bill is just the latest example of how you and other Democratic leaders are driving young people away from the Democratic Party,\u201d the groups wrote in a joint letter released on Thursday. \u201cInstead of taking a stand against Trump\u2019s illegal actions to gut our healthcare, dismantle public education, attack immigrants and trans people, and tear up climate action, you supported a budget that gave tax cuts to Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and their billionaire buddies. You sided against us.\u201d This is just the latest call for Schumer\u2019s resignation. Representative Glenn Ivey was the first national elected official to call for him to step down as Democratic Senate leader, with Representative Delia Ramirez following soon after. Even Nancy Pelosi recently expressed her doubts in Schumer. While the longtime Democratic Senate leader insists that a shutdown would have granted the Trump administration control of the narrative, Democrats young and old are begging him to resist rather than capitulate.  \u201cGen Z voters want leaders with a backbone who will stand up to billionaires and fight for working people,\u201d the letter continued. \u201cIf you want our support, it\u2019s time to get bolder, get louder, or make way for leadership who will. If you don\u2019t get this right, we are ready to take the reins of this party ourselves to shape it into a force that can fight for working people and defeat growing authoritarian power.\u201d","label":0}

The whole 'Made in India' market grew in 2024, while Samsung improved its market share and led its competitors. Reading time: 2 minutes The Indian government's Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, which encourages global manufacturers to set up production facilities in the country and make products locally, seems to be paying off for all parties involved. The \u201cMade in India\u201d smartphone market increased by 6% in 2024, and Samsung kept the lead.  Samsung is the largest smartphone brand that manufactures handsets in India. It had a 20% market share and registered a 7% growth year-on-year by the end of 2024.  According to Counterpoint Research, the Korean tech giant improved its position thanks to a 13% year-on-year increase in exports. In the \u201cMade in India\u201d smartphone segment, Samsung was followed by:  Of the top five brands, Oppo was the only one to experience a decline in the \u201cMade in India\u201d smartphone market, as it dropped from 19% in 2023 to 12% a year later. Oppo faced intense competition but also fell short because of contract manufacturing deals.  It's worth noting that local manufacturers such as Foxconn and Tata Electronics assemble iPhones in India. Tata Electronics was the fastest-growing phone manufacturer thanks to the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16.  Tata Electronics expanded its iPhone assembly plants and even entered the semiconductor game at a new plant in Gujarat.  Apple and Samsung combined account for roughly 94% of India's smartphone exports. In the future, Foxconn intends to set up a local smartphone display manufacturing facility to improve its production capabilities.  Samsung manufactures Galaxy phones of varying price points in India. Even the latest Galaxy S25 series sold in India is made at the Noida plant. The tech giant also assembles Galaxy A, Galaxy F, and Galaxy M models locally.   See the latest Galaxy S25 deals in your market  These findings suggest that the PLI scheme, combined with the benefits of diversifying the supply chain and affordable labor costs, has helped smartphone makers like Samsung set up production facilities in India and increase local production.  Market watchers expect \u201cMade in India\u201d smartphone manufacturing to grow in double digits this year.

{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"  David Crane and Marta Kauffman's \"Friends\" is one of the great hang-out sitcoms of all time. Built around six immensely appealing and talented young actors, the series offered a peppy portrait of twentysomething\/thirtysomething Generation X ennui. Its characters weren't necessarily aimless, but they definitely didn't have it together. What they did have was each other, which was a weekly Must-See TV balm for the souls of many a Gen X-er going through similar tsuris in the 1990s and 2000s. While viewers all over the world could relate to the struggles of Monica (Courtney Cox), Rachel (Jennifer Aniston), Chandler (Matthew Perry), Ross (David Schwimmer), Joey (Matt LeBlanc), and Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow), there were aspects of these characters' lives that were a tad hard to swallow. Sure, many of us knew what it was like to struggle to get by in a bustling metropolis like New York City (I lived there during the peak of the series' popularity), but none of us could ever hope to slug it out while living in a stunningly spacious apartment in the West Village. As someone who did a fair amount of apartment hopping during that period, I will tell you that if a broker (which I couldn't afford in the first place) showed me a flat akin to Monica and Rachel's place, I would've punched them in the face for trying to humiliate me. That's a rich person's apartment. How rich? That's a question many people have asked over the years, and while we can't give you exact numbers for fictional accommodations, we can ballpark it. Prepare to be astonished.   According to Architectural Digest, Monica's \"shabby chic\" and \"countrycore\" apartment would've set off a bidding war the second it hit the market. So how did Monica land such prime Manhattan real estate? Her grandmother illegally sublet it to her! Per the show's canon, the apartment is rent-controlled, which means the unit's rent increases were reasonably incremental to not drive the un-moneyed tenant (in this case Monica's grandmother) out of her residence and, potentially, onto the streets. This means Nana, who'd retired to Florida, occupied this apartment for quite some time, and, as a senior citizen collecting Social Security in the Sunshine State (as was her right as a once hard-working American), probably didn't need to charge her granddaughter market value for the unit. Once you factor this in, you're in the too-good-to-be-true realm of Hollywood entertainment, like Adam Sandler's unemployed protagonist in Paul Thomas Anderson's beloved \"Big Daddy\" living in a Manhattan loft because he banked a massive settlement off a minor accident. At this point, you should probably just shrug and enjoy the fantasy, which is easy to do because \"Friends\" was a consistently hilarious show with very few dud episodes. But you still need to know, right? Spoiler: Monica and Rachel would've never sniffed a Manhattan apartment of that caliber.   In 2024, Architectural Digest cited the real-estate concierge company Clever, which used current Department of Labor statistics to determine that occupants Rachel and Monica\u00a0\u2014 who worked, respectively, as a chef and a waitress at the series' outset\u00a0\u2014 earned $120,000 a year combined. They then zeroed in on apartment 12A at 136 Waverly Place in the West Village as a stand-in for the unit (estimated to be somewhere between 1,125 and 1,500 square feet) and decided Monica and Rachel would've had to pull down at least $321,429 combined to afford the rent straight-up. If they wanted to purchase the unit, they'd have to make $782,379 to cover the $2.65 million it would go for on today's market. Obviously, any member of the \"Friends\" cast could afford to buy the entire building nowadays. Had Crane and Kauffman taken a realistic approach to \"Friends,\" they would've placed Monica and Rachel in a railroad apartment somewhere in Alphabet City, which would've lent the show a decidedly gritty air that probably wouldn't have appealed to people who like their network sitcom settings to be aspirational. Considering the circles the \"Friends\" gang traveled in, there also would've been more job turnover and copious cocaine use. Again, because I lived in New York City at the time, I would've loved this. My guess, and it's just a guess, is that NBC might've frowned at such a depiction.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-20","content":"ByLiz Thach, MW  ByLiz Thach, MW,  Contributor.  How will tariffs impact U.S. consumers? The U.S. is the fourth largest wine-producing nation in the world but still doesn\u2019t produce enough to slake the thirst of American wine lovers. Instead, every year, the U.S. imports around 37% of the wine it consumes, about 5 times more than it exports. This analysis was conducted by Rafael del Rey, an international wine economist and founder of Del Rey Analysts of Wine Markets. Headquartered in the EU and with more than 30 years of experience analyzing the global wine trade, he has recently published a report on the impact of the potential 200% tariffs the Trump administration has threatened on E.U. wine exports, as well as strategies businesses can adopt. \u201cGiven that 72.3% of the imported wine to the U.S. comes from EU countries, the potential 200% tariff increase would make it nearly impossible for distributors and consumers to continue purchasing them at the new prices,\u201d states del Rey in an online interview. For example, a bottle of Veuve-Clicquot Yellow Label Brut Champagne\u2014the top-selling champagne in the U.S. market, which averages around $65 per bottle at retail\u2014could soar to over $150 per bottle. \u201cUltimately, American consumers would face a difficult choice: either pay significantly higher prices for wine or reduce their consumption,\u201d continued del Rey. Wine Imports and exports In and From the U.S. Of course, American wineries could benefit from expanding their wine production and brands to fill in the gap, but will U.S. consumers be willing to give up their European wines? Given that 49% of American wine consumers regularly or occasionally drink wine from the EU, according to the Wine Market Council, many consumers may be reluctant to give up their \u201cold world wines\u201d\u2014many of which have different flavors and styles from their U.S. counterparts. Furthermore, the time to plant and develop new vineyards to increase U.S. production ranges from 2 to 5 years, so the lag time would be quite significant. Plus, at this point, there doesn\u2019t appear to be any promotional messaging to drink more American wine. However, the American wine market is quite lucrative\u2014even with declining consumption\u2014because consumers continue to trade up in price points. According to Gomberg-Fredrikson, a U.S. wine market intelligence firm, Americans purchased $78.9 billion worth of domestic wine and $31.6 billion of imported wine in 2024, up from 3.4% in value from 2023. The tariff conversation appears to be shifting on almost a daily basis, leading experts to question the outcome. Will the proposed EU wine tariffs ultimately end at 200%, or be negotiated to similar levels as those imposed by the Trump administration in 2019? \u201cEU wine producers had already faced a tariff hike in 2019, but it was limited to the four countries involved in the Airbus project\u2014France, Spain, Germany and the U.K. That increase was 25%, initially backed by the WTO, and was resolved within a few months,\u201d reported del Rey. But it is possible that the EU could retaliate similarly to Canada when they were threatened with a 25% tariff. Even though the proposed tariff was paused until April 2, Canadian retailers retaliated by immediately canceling all U.S. wine orders and removing American wines from their store shelves. It is possible that the EU could engage in further retaliation tactics, such as taxing French wine barrels, corks, bottles and other wine production equipment that American wineries purchase from European countries. \u201cThese tariffs started when the U.S. imposed tariffs on EU aluminum, the EU responded by raising tariffs on U.S. bourbon, and the U.S. retaliated with higher tariffs on EU wines\u2014creating an endless cycle. It\u2019s a senseless approach,\u201d stated del Rey. \u201cIn the end, businesses on both sides and, most importantly, consumers, bear the greatest burden from the proposed EU tariffs,\u201d del Rey said.  Rafael del Rey, International Wine Economist, Founder,  Del Rey Analysts of Wine Markets When asked what wine businesses and consumers could do to successfully navigate this dynamic period of tariff wars, del Rey responded: \u201cConvincing the new U.S. administration of these negative consequences is one part of the strategy. The other key strategy is diversification. This was evident when Australia faced new Chinese tariffs and again during the pandemic when different countries imposed varying trade and consumption restrictions.\u201d However, with the U.S. being the largest wine-consuming market in the world, it is not realistic in the short term that EU producers will be able to find a home for all of their wine. According to Ignacio Sanchez Recarte, Secretary General of the Comit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9en des Entreprises Vins, in an interview with Bloomberg, many grape growers and wine producers will be in deep financial trouble if the proposed tariffs go through. \u201cWe will see companies closing the door, because there is no way we can find an alternative market that quickly.\u201d Meanwhile in the U.S., many wine lovers are already stocking up on their favorite European wines, with reports of runs on champagne, prosecco and other popular wine styles and regions at wine retailers. For those who love European wines, this may be the best strategy to pursue in the short term, until the uncertainty over potential wine tariffs is resolved.
