{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"Business Insider Edition  US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday during an NBC News interview that there are \"no guarantees\" there won't be a recession. He also expressed confidence in the major stock indexes amid threats of a prolonged trade war.          \"You know that there are no guarantees, like who would have predicted Covid, right?\" Bessent told \"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker. \"I can predict that we are putting in robust policies that will be durable, and there could be an adjustment.\"               Bessent said he was \"not at all\" worried about the state of the stock market, which has fluctuated dramatically since President Donald Trump ramped up his tariff threats.               \"I've been in the investment business for 35 years, and I can tell you that corrections are healthy. They're normal,\" the treasury secretary said. \"What's not healthy is straight up, that you get these euphoric markets. That's how you get a financial crisis.\"               \"I'm not worried about the markets,\" he continued. \"Over the long term, if we put good tax policy in place, deregulation, and energy security, the markets will do great.\"               In recent days, the S&P 500 has fallen over 10% from recent highs, while the Nasdaq composite has declined about 14% from its December 2024 high.               Trump, with some exceptions, has levied 25% tariffs against Canada and Mexico. He has also threatened 200% tariffs on European wine and spirits and placed 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the United States. Trump has imposed two rounds of 10% tariffs on China since February.               Trump also recently declined to shut down the possibility of a recession. \"I hate to predict things like that,\" he said during a Fox News interview earlier this month. \"There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big.\"               His comments led to another market downturn. Last week, the president changed his tune, telling reporters at the White House that he didn't foresee a recession.               \"I don't see it at all. I think this country is going to boom,\" he said. \"Markets are going to go up, and they're going to go down. But you know what?

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"Business Insider Edition  Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. What would you do if you won $10 million? The winner of MrBeast's \"Beast Games\" told us he immediately started estate planning and exploring tax strategies.  On the agenda today:   But first: 25 years since the bubble burst.       If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here.           The sheer timing of the market's recent sell-off has an eerie precedent.               As my colleague Matthew Fox reports, this month marks the 25th anniversary of the peak of the dot-com bubble. Back then, a burgeoning technology called the World Wide Web lit a fire under the markets. Stock valuations soared to dizzying levels.               The boom times eventually gave way to an epic bust. In March 2000, the party stopped. The tech-heavy Nasdaq would lose nearly 80% of its value over the next few years.               There are parallels between then and now. Today's AI mania looks much like the internet excitement of the late 1990s.               Yet few expect a similar decline this time around. The IPO market is dormant and deal activity hasn't picked up. Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO, told BI's Fox that the stock market is nowhere near a bubble. \"In a bubble, everybody makes money,\" Belski said.               Regardless, the market's high-fliers have been hit hard. Tesla has lost roughly half its value and warned the Trump administration that it could suffer from increased costs due to a trade war. Shares of Nvidia and Apple are teetering and the so-called Magnificent 7 suddenly doesn't look so magnificent anymore.               While Trump's trade policies have fueled much of the market's recent declines, the Trump administration doesn't seem too perturbed. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Thursday that the White House is unconcerned about \"a little\" market volatility. That isn't a ringing endorsement of things turning around anytime soon.       Friday's rally alleviated some concerns and pulled the S&P 500 out of correction territory. But it is still in the red for the year.               Here's to hoping we're not headed for dot-com dj vu.       Has the market sell-off gone too far? Or do you expect it to go down even more? Let me know your thoughts: today@businessinsider.com.   Read the full story.           Amazon's five-day return-to-office hit some speedbumps early on, with reports of office theft, a shortage of desks, and overflowing parking lots.               Ten weeks into the rollout, we're checking in with Amazon employees across corporate departments and the country to see how they've adjusted. Eleven people told us their experiences, which ranged from energized and connected to depressed and demoralized.       Plus, two employees explained why they left.           Even before the stock market's whirlwind week, recession fears had been gripping Wall Street. BI spoke to financial planners who shared what you can do now to prepare for a possible recession.               Their biggest advice? Do not panic. Fear can be a powerful motivator to take drastic measures. And if you haven't already, now is the time to build your emergency fund.       Actions you can take now.           Layoffs are the new normal in Big Tech, but is turning up the heat on \"low performers\" really the best strategy? Research says otherwise.               Demanding versus demeaning \u2014 BI's Aki Ito doesn't think every tech exec is getting it right.       Why firing them doesn't \"raise the bar.\"           Private equity is one of the most sought-after careers in the finance industry. These firms are increasingly driving the world of corporate dealmaking as investors flock to the sector.               BI pulled publicly available data for 12 firms, including Blackstone, Apollo, and KKR. Salaries for entry-level analysts start at $100,000, and for partners and managing directors, those salaries can soar up to $500,000.       How much those in PE make.   This week's quote:            \"No one in America should feel threatened or targeted simply for driving a vehicle.\"               \u2014 A Cybertruck owner spoke to BI about facing growing hostility and verbal harassment.       More of this week's top reads:  A photographer took a shot of Trump's notes \u2014 and they read like a Tesla sales pitch. The BI Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"Business Insider Edition  Pete Petersen, 58, doesn't know when, if ever, he'll be prepared to retire as he hoped.          Petersen, who spent much of his career working for a consumer products healthcare division of a pharmaceutical company, hasn't worked full-time since early last year. Petersen, who lives in Massachusetts, has been looking, but many jobs pay below the six-figure salary he was earning a few years ago. While he could retire later this year, he would live on half the budget he would've hoped to.               \"I could tap my 401(k) in nine months, but then my retirement isn't what I wanted it to be,\" Petersen said, adding he's accepted he may never land a dream job again. \"I need one more job and 401(k) to be able to travel.\"       Do you have a story to share about working into your later years? Please fill out this quick Google Form.           Business Insider has heard from over 600 older Americans who are eitherlooking for work or still working. Unemployed people said it was very difficult to find a job, thanks to ageism in the hiring process, rapidly changing technology, and a lack of open roles that meet their salary expectations or skill sets. Meanwhile, those with jobs are weighing retirement against their financial needs and the sense of purpose they get from work.               As of February, 37.8 million people over the age of 55 were employed and 1.1 million were unemployed, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics.               Through emails and online nonrepresentative surveys over the past three months, readers shared their job search struggles,retirement challenges, and the ways work boosts their savings while keeping them busy. BI combed through more than 500 reader responses from workers 55 and older and over 100 emails and found four main themes. This is the first story in a new series on how older Americans navigate work.               Scott Strohmyer, 60, has looked for work since he was laid off last year from his partnerships manager job. He said unemployment hurt his finances and forced him to leave Los Angeles \u2014 where he lived for 30 years \u2014 and move in with family in Nebraska.               Strohmyer said he passed the first round of interviews with six employers but hasn't received a job offer. He's concerned his age and employment gap have made companies less likely to hire him.               \"If you don't work for six months, you're quickly becoming irrelevant because technology evolves and changes so quickly,\" said Strohmyer, who worked in IT for over two decades.               Strohmyer often sees jobs posted that have hundreds of applicants.               \"If you see over 100 applicants and the job has been posted for longer than a day, don't even bother, because they're probably only looking at the first 30 to 50,\" Strohmyer said.               Most older Americans said searching for work late in their careers was challenging. Some recalled recruiters telling them they were too experienced, while others said they were passed over for younger applicants who would accept less money. Higher-paid white-collar workers said open positions in their former pay range were rare.               A few dozen said they haven't learned to use new hiring technology, while others wished they kept up with AI developments to be more marketable.               Some, particularly those over 70 who work because they need the money, said physically demanding positions were off the table, while others said they couldn't sit at a desk for eight hours.               Patty Blue Hayes, who is in her early 60s, has struggled to generate enough income over the past few years. She worked as an independent contractor for a professional training company until 2023, when her program was discontinued.               In 2019, Hayes moved from California to Panama to save money. While she's benefited from the lower cost of living, she said she's struggled to find steady work.               Hayes relies in part on income from a guest house she rents in Panama through Airbnb, but it's not enough. To cover her essential expenses, she said she's used credit cards but has racked up more than $2,000 in debt.               Many older Americans told BI that they have switched to or are considering blue-collar or noncorporate work because of the slowdown in white-collar hiring.               Some now begrudgingly drive for Uber, work as cashiers, or wait tables. Others said they've appreciated the increased flexibility and reduced stress of these jobs.               In 2018, Victor Jerome retired from his nearly 30-year management career at Ikea. But Jerome said retirement soon became \"boring,\" so he signed up for the gig platform TaskRabbit. Customers pay him to assemble furniture and mount TVs, and he made roughly $55,000 through the platform last year. He said he plans to \"really retire\" in two to four years.               \"After sitting behind a laptop for years planning new stores, the physical nature of tasking was refreshing,\" said Jerome, 61, who lives in Baltimore.               A common theme among respondents was an unwillingness to retire, fearing they wouldn't have enough income through Social Security to live comfortably. Another problem is that they don't know how much they need to retire comfortably.               It's a conundrum for financial advisors, many of whom only agree on certain big-picture principles, like saving consistently and diversifying investments. Financial advisors have told BI that each person's goals and circumstances vary, so there isn't a set number someone needs for retirement.               Stacy Kopper, 63, is unsure how much she'll need or at what age she may stop working entirely.               Kopper, who lives in Wyoming, has worked asa freelance travel director and planning assistant for the last two decades. She earns in the mid-to-high five figures annually.               Kopper thinks she'll need to work for the next few years on a part time basis to stay afloat. While she hasabout $250,000 in her IRAs, said she doesn't own property and house sits for friends. She and a pal are saving up so they can afford a mortgage together.               Even if she saves enough, Kopper isn't sure if she'll retire. The idea of working at an animal shelter appeals to her.               \"My father retired and spent almost every day fishing off the docks, and that was his idea of retirement,\" Kopper said. \"That was not me. I don't see myself sitting around.\"               Many respondents who are better prepared for retirement said they were careful with their money during their careers. Some told BI they wanted to retire early because they derive purpose from family, travel, and other non-work parts of their lives. Others said they could retire, but they're more fulfilled working and fear they would be bored or lose meaning at home.               Jeff Dupper, 57, retired early in December after 35 years working in the aerospace industry. Dupper, who lives in a Denver suburb, earned a robust salary during his career and kept his money in Vanguard low-cost index funds.               After determining he should have enough saved to get him through his 90s, Dupper retired when he and his wife were in the mid-seven-figure net worth range. Dupper said he regrets being too conservative with his money earlier in life, though he said retiring early has given him peace of mind despite some initial hesitation.               \"Everyone focuses on the numbers because you can see them, and there's math involved, but there's a soft side,\" Dupper said. \"I lost sleep envisioning the day I would turn in my notice, whether I would regret it financially or would lose purpose.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"Business Insider Edition  Just when you thought you'd be making your summer travel plans \u2014 Japan or Paris anyone? \u2014 economic anxiety appears to be rearing its ugly head.          Following years of a post-pandemic boom, travel demand is finally showing signs of slowing down. Though spending on leisure travel remains high, consumer confidence has plummeted, tariff whiplash has left prices and the stock market in limbo, and fears over a recession are mounting \u2014 and that's on top of planes crashing and spats with our allies.               Vanessa Roberts, a 35-year-old from Los Angeles, said she and her husband traveled frequently in 2024, including a trip to England and an eight-state road trip. But in 2025, they're embracing smaller trips and focusing on traveling locally or regionally instead of shelling out for pricier destinations.               \"I have a long list of short trips we have planned for the year, and they're all very affordable,\" Roberts, who shares travel content on TikTok, told Business Insider.               Travel companies are bracing themselves for the impact. Airlines such as Delta, American, and Southwest have cut their projections for Q1. Analysts at Truist Securities said in a note Friday that bookings in the cruise industry have slowed over the past month. Some industry experts who spoke to BI said companies could be compelled to offer more deals in order to allure hesitant, budget-conscious travelers.               There is good news for the industry, though. Even if consumers are worried about paying their bills, many of them will still make travel work \u2014 though often with some sacrifices along the way.               \"For American travelers, travel has shifted from a want to more of a need,\" Amir Eylon, president and CEO of Longwoods International, a market research consultancy that specializes in the travel tourism industry, told BI.               Eylon said that while travel demand is strong, it has shown recent signs of slowing. A monthly survey conducted by his firm found that 88% of American travelers planned to take a trip in the next six months, compared to 93% during the same month last year.               That softening demand can largely be chalked up to one thing: the economy. Though plane crashes \u2014 like recent incidents in Washington, DC, and Toronto \u2014 do cause concern among travelers, Eylon said it would likely take an extended pattern of safety incidents to actually deter people from flying.               Ali Furman, consumer markets industry leader at PwC, and Jonathan Kletzel, transportation and logistics leader at PwC, also told BI in an email that American consumers are cutting back on travel spending right now, citing economic uncertainty and financial pressures being felt across income levels.               Americans saved a lot in the pandemic and then spent a lot during the post-pandemic travel boom, but it could finally be catching up with them. Household debt has grown steadily, with many struggling to pay off their credit cards and car loans. Furman and Kletzel said Americans could be pulling back on spending, including travel, to avoid overextending themselves financially.               It's that combination of debt and other economic headwinds that have softened demand and left travelers looking for better deals, Eylon said, adding, \"travelers are seeking value much more strongly than they were a couple years ago.\"               Tamara Charm, a McKinsey partner who focuses on consumer insights, told BI there's still a \"splurge mentality for experiences right now.\" Even when consumers say they'd like to cut back on traveling, that doesn't always happen.               Instead, many travelers still take trips but cut back in other ways. That could mean traveling domestically instead of internationally \u2014 staycations, or traveling locally or regionally, were popular in the wake of the Great Recession \u2014 as well as opting for budget hotels, buying fewer souvenirs, or eating fast food over fancy dinners every night on vacation, Eylon said.               Furman and Kletzel of PwC have heard from their clients that travelers are now waiting to book their trips, including flights, hotels, and rental cars, until closer to their gates of travel due to that economic uncertainty. They said travelers are being more strategic in their spending and in timing their vacations to maximize value.               \"This moderation is different from the post-pandemic surge when consumers were willing to pay almost any price for a trip,\" they said. \"Now, financial pressures are causing them to think twice before booking.\"               Mandy McKaskle, a luxury travel advisor at Embark Beyond, told BI she's also noticed that some of her clients who would already be planning their trips for the summer and even the holidays seem to be holding off.               These changes are mostly being seen among budget travelers, but if the stock market continues to see volatility, higher-income consumers could also cut back on discretionary spending, including travel, Furman and Kletzel said. That means demand for luxury travel could be hit too.               There may yet be a bright side for travelers in all this: Airlines and hotels experiencing a slowdown in bookings could slash prices or offer attractive deals at various price points to keep people coming, Furman and Kletzel said.               \"We expect that softening in demand means potential deals on the horizon for customers looking to book travel in late summer and into the holiday season,\" they said.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"David L. Farquhar on technology old and new, computer security, and more Home \u00bb Retro Computing \u00bb Microsoft\u2019s 1986 IPO On March 13, 1986, Microsoft shook up the financial world, and to some degree, we are still feeling the reverberations from that 40 years later. That was the day of Microsoft\u2019s very successful IPO. The hunt for the next Microsoft began immediately, leading directly to the dotcom bubble of the turn of the century.  Microsoft\u2019s IPO initially valued company at $21.00 per share. It raised $61 million for the company, and put its market capitalization at $777 million. The price peaked at $35.50 per share before settling to $27.75 at the end of the day. Microsoft expected it to take weeks to reach $27.75. Bill Gates owned 45% of the company\u2019s stock, which meant on March 14, 1986, he was worth almost $350 million. He had not yet turned 31. The next year, he became the youngest person to become a billionaire, before he had turned 32. Founded in 1975, Microsoft was an 11-year-old company at the time it went public. They waited so long because Bill Gates wanted to maintain control over the company as long as he could. By 1986, Microsoft had to go public. This wasn\u2019t because they needed money. Their profit margins were enviable, at 34% of their pre tax revenue. Microsoft didn\u2019t need the $61 million the IPO raised. The reason Microsoft had to go public in 1986 was because Bill Gates had been using stock to attract talent. Microsoft projected that by sometime in 1987, they would have 500 shareholders, which would require Microsoft to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission, effectively turning them into a publicly traded company, but without the benefits of going public in the conventional way. Backed into this corner, Gates agreed in late 1985 to pursue an IPO. Motley Fool greatly oversimplifies Microsoft\u2019s early years, as do others. They\u2019re better at SEO than analysis. Microsoft\u2019s best known products in 1986 were PC DOS and MS-DOS, the text-based operating systems for IBM and IBM-compatible PCs. In 1986, Microsoft Windows existed, barely, but wasn\u2019t yet successful. Microsoft\u2019s secret was that virtually every computer on the market was running some Microsoft product. Its operating system powered the booming PC market. But Excel was the most popular spreadsheet on the Macintosh. Its predecessor, Multiplan, was a reasonably popular spreadsheet on other platforms. Microsoft Word was an up and coming word processor. Microsoft Basic was one of the most popular programming languages, and ran on virtually every platform. Sometimes Microsoft licensed software on a royalty basis and sometimes for a flat rate up front. Getting the flat rate up front shielded Microsoft from losing profits to piracy early on. But once Microsoft could afford to risk some loss to piracy, it was more profitable to take a royalty per unit sold. There were 60 million IBM and IBM-compatible PCs sold in the 1980s, and Microsoft collected a royalty on virtually every single one. Then in 1991, it discovered it could sell new versions of MS-DOS as upgrades and make money on each unit sold a second time. When Windows 3.0 hit the market in May 1990, the game was essentially over. Microsoft could sell you an operating system, a graphical environment, and versions of Word and Excel that ran in that environment, all running on commodity hardware that was getting cheaper by the quarter, if not the month. Although it would be a few years before other companies would give up, a monopoly in operating systems and office suites was inevitable before 1990 was over. The more successful Microsoft became, the more afraid of failure and anticompetitive it became. This led to legal issues in the late 1990s. Microsoft reformed to a degree and is more tolerant of certain competing products continuing to exist than it was in the 90s. Today, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet (formerly Google) are larger than Microsoft, but the four companies are the only technology firms in the 2024 Fortune 20 list. The fifth largest technology firm is Meta, the social media company everyone loves to hate, at #30. To this day, young ambitious people enroll in school to get technical degrees in hopes of becoming the next Bill Gates, and venture capitalists like Kevin O\u2019Leary and Marc Andreessen (himself a cofounder of a failed dotcom) prey on them. These ambitious programmer\/entrepreneurs rarely get rich, but the venture capitalists have figured out how to make money even as the businesses they fund fail. Today\u2019s entrepreneurs would do well to note that Microsoft made minimal use of venture capital. Microsoft\u2019s only VC only owned 6.2 percent of the company. Gates didn\u2019t trust them. If you\u2019re thinking of trying your hand at being the next Bill Gates, keep that in mind. Another direct consequence of the Microsoft IPO was the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s and the subsequent recession. Fear of missing out on the next Microsoft drove up the value of anything tech- or Internet-related. Investors believed the next Microsoft would come out of that generation of companies. In the end they were kind of right. Two companies from that wave ended up matching and eventually eclipsing Microsoft. But it wasn\u2019t exactly clear until a few years after the dotcom bust that Amazon and Google would be the ones to do it. Short-lived randos like VA Linux, Geocities, Cyberrebate, and Internet America were able to come along for the ride while the market shook out.

At full price, you\u2019ll save about $20, but while I was writing this, the RGB version was marked down, making it the cheapest 2x16GB enthusiast kit available, so keep an eye out for sales. When you\u2019re only spending $100-200, even a little discount can make a big difference. As Corsair\u2019s most premium RAM, these DIMMs get special treatment, including a die-cast aluminum heat-spreader in black or white, with RGB LEDs encased in the top. This memory is blisteringly fast, with speeds up to 7,000MHz available for folks who really need to max out their performance, and integration with Corsair\u2019s iCUE software so you can keep track of lighting, temperature, and performance monitoring. I don\u2019t think most people will benefit from the kind of performance you\u2019ll find here, but if you only want the very best, this is it. While the standard G.Skill Trident Z5 has an elegant bar with a series of diffused LEDs across the top, the Royal line eschews any subtlety in favor of chunky crystal structures that have a bright, shining underglow. Combine that with your choice of mirrored gold or silver finishes, and these DIMMs are guaranteed to fit in with the fanciest builds and shiniest components. You may have to compromise a little on performance, but when you look that good, it\u2019s tough to complain. Laptops and some miniature PCs may opt for a different form factor called SODIMM, which helps them squeeze into tighter spaces. For most folks, this basic Crucial laptop memory will be just the ticket to replace or expand your laptop\u2019s RAM. There\u2019s less room here for manufacturers to differentiate themselves with features like heat spreaders or lighting, and Crucial offers a wide array of sizes and kits to make sure they\u2019ll fit into your system. Make sure to check your laptop\u2019s manual before you buy any memory to get an idea for whether the existing memory is permanently soldered, as well as how many slots are available for upgrade, and their max capacity. While newer systems are going to almost exclusively use DDR5, you might be looking to upgrade an older system. Alternatively, DDR4 memory tends to be cheaper than DDR5, so you can save a bit of cash building with older parts. In fact, for less than 32GB of DDR5, you can take home 64GB of Corsair Vengeance DDR4 at 3,200MHz. With DDR4\u2019s time on the market limited, I\u2019d try and up the capacity you buy to make sure you\u2019re set for the long run. There are currently two standards on the market, and there probably will continue to be for a while as DDR4 phases out. Chances are, if you\u2019re upgrading an older system, you\u2019ll need DDR4 RAM, and if you\u2019re building a new system, you\u2019ll be looking for DDR5. Check your motherboard model to make sure, because they aren\u2019t compatible with each other. You can also check out an in-depth explainer on the differences between DDR4 and DDR5 if you\u2019re curious. Once you know whether you need DDR4 or DDR5, the next major decision is how much memory you want. Unless you really plan on just browsing the web and watching the occasional video, I recommend starting at 32GB. Most memory is sold in kits, so if you want 32GB you\u2019ll typically buy a pair of 16GB sticks, often shown in listings as 2x16GB, and install them according to your motherboard\u2019s instructions for dual channel memory. Some gamers may benefit from 64GB of memory, but anything more would be for special use cases. The other number you\u2019re likely to see prominently displayed on memory is clock speed, measured in MHz. DDR5 starts at 3,200MHz, but it seems like most DIY memory falls in the 6,000-6,400MHz range. Some enthusiast RAM goes all the way up to 8,000MHz, but I don\u2019t think the average user will benefit from that much speed. Notably, if you want to fully utilize your RAM\u2019s stated speed, you\u2019ll need to make sure XMP, or AMD\u2019s EXPO, are enabled in your BIOS. Check your motherboard manual for more information on enabling the feature and setting your MHz properly. Performance has another measurable function in the form of CL, or CAS Latency. While the clock speed measures how fast the RAM can move data, the CL denotes how quickly it can access that data, with a lower number meaning faster access. While clock speeds got a huge bump with DDR5, the CL numbers might look high to folks who have experience with DDR4. Just know that the higher clock speeds make up for this difference, so now we\u2019re looking at 28-30 for the first number instead of the 12-16 we had before. There are a few considerations you also may want to keep in mind when purchasing memory for your system. Most modules are roughly the same size, but if you have a large CPU cooler you may want to make sure any shrouds on the memory aren\u2019t too tall. Most DIY motherboards don\u2019t have capacity limits for memory that should concern your average PC user, or even gamer, but if you\u2019re upgrading an older system, you\u2019ll want to check the manual and motherboard model to confirm how much storage it can handle. Know that there are typically two sizes of memory module. You\u2019ll usually find DIMMs in desktop computers, and SO-DIMMs in laptops, but some very small desktop computers may opt for laptop memory. 10% Off Wayfair Promo Code with sign-up 20% off Dyson Promo Code $50 Off In-Person Tax Prep When You Switch From Your Tax Current Provider Up to $500 off cameras at Canon Save extra 10% Off TurboTax Exclusive: Up To 50% Off 6 Boxes With Factor Promo Code More From WIRED Reviews and Guides \u00a9 2025 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

Reviews ethics statement      Certain fruits and vegetables are a better bargain than they seem at face value.    The price you pay for fruits and vegetables at the grocery store doesn't tell the whole story.\u00a0 Once upon a time, in culinary school, we were asked to do something I think most of us had hoped to avoid as aspiring chefs: math. Rather than prepping food for the pan, by precisely cubing potatoes and dicing up the day's mirepoix with our usual knives, we spent the morning with retractable pencils, doing a little light algebra.\u00a0 What we were calculating was the actual cost of ingredients, mainly produce, based on how much of a given item is usable. Consider unavoidable food waste such as banana peels, the cores of bell peppers, the ends of celery, and so on.\u00a0 When you're paying for an item by weight, in culinary math terms the yield, or \"edible portion\" of a given item factors into its actual cost, which is necessary for chefs to consider when accounting for how to price a dish.\u00a0 Should you be calculating every element that goes into your home-cooked meals? Certainly not. (Or rather, hopefully not? Given the state of the economy and the price of eggs, some of us might have to.) But culinary math can help determine what you're actually spending in the produce aisle versus what you're potentially wasting. Whether you're about saving pennies or saving the environment by considering food waste\u00a0(or you'd like to do both), there are food items that have a lower value considering how much of them you can consume. Fruits and vegetables offer starkly different overall value when edible yield is considered.\u00a0 Fear not, this isn't an exercise that involves actually measuring the weight of banana peels or trying to assign a percentage to how much of the ends of zucchini you throw out. Even chefs make use of handy yield charts that inform, on average, how much of a given item is usable. Determining the actual cost of an ingredient, then, involves calculating the new price based on the edible portion. For instance, if a head of cauliflower costs $1.49 per pound, and only 55% of it is usable -- once you remove the core and leaves -- then the per pound cost increases by almost double for the usable portion. You may have spent about $3 on two pounds of cauliflower, but you're getting to use only a little over a pound of what you paid for. To determine the actual cost, then, you take the purchase cost and divide by the yield percentage, expressed as a decimal.\u00a0 For example: $1.49\/.55 = $2.70\u00a0 A head of cauliflower has a considerably low edible yield. Suddenly, that head of cauliflower doesn't seem like so much of a bargain. Consider, also, that chefs might routinely make use of more of various fruits and vegetables than do home cooks. Broccoli stems can be peeled, cooked and pulverized into a cream of broccoli soup, and onions can go, skin and all, into a pot of stock. Lemons and limes typically get zested before they get juiced, and even pineapple skin has culinary applications. Pineapple fronds may even end up as garnish in the cocktail menu. Watermelon rinds can be pickled. Are you pickling your watermelon rinds at home? Didn't think so. Next time you load up on bell peppers at the market, consider that you'll only be consuming about 65% of the total product. You don't need to be purchasing in bulk by weight to consider how much of an ingredient you're actually going to be able to use. Understanding the yield of certain items can help you look at the price tag a little differently, as well as consider how much is headed for the trash.\u00a0 Here are 12 common items in the grocery store that have the lowest percentages of edible portion, and therefore the highest waste. (Garden peas have the smallest usable portion, at 38%, but lucky for all of us, if you're actually shelling peas at home, you probably grew them yourself.) Using current prices I collected from Instacart. Cauliflower $2.99 each 55% $5.43 each Asparagus $2.99\/lb. 56% $5.34\/lb. Broccoli $2.99\/bunch 61% $4.90\/bunch Fennel bulb $2.69 each 60% $4.48 each Green leaf lettuce $1.99\/head 67% $2.97\/head Bell peppers $1.50 each 65% $2.31 each Butternut squash $3.37 each 66% $5.10 each Banana 45 cents each 67% 67 cents each Cantaloupe $4.99 each 50% $9.98 each Pineapple $5.99 each 52% $11.52 each Watermelon $6.99 each 47% $14.87 each Grapefruit $2.29 each 47% $4.87 each According to the US\u00a0Environmental Protection Agency (while it still exists), food waste accounts for 60% of greenhouse gas emissions. Even if you're a consummate recycler who always brings your own grocery bags to the store, if you don't have a way to deal with food waste (a local food waste recycling program, a backyard compost pile, or a countertop food recycling appliance), the produce you buy most often may be contributing to the problem more than how it's packaged. Berries may seem expensive at first glance, but they're one of of the highest yield types of produce you'll find at the market.\u00a0 Read more:\u00a0I Cut My Kitchen Waste by 80% in One Week With This Small Appliance Maybe the above chart helps you think creatively about how to use more of what you buy, or at least helps you adjust your shopping habits, if you're someone who frequently throws out stuff that's gone bad. Perhaps it puts in perspective the extreme cost of buying certain items out of season, especially items that have a low yield. (Looking at you, watermelon.) Spinach is cheap, good for you and results in very little food waste after preparing. Fortunately, however, there are many items in the produce aisle that have high percentages of usable portions.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"ByTom Aspray  ByTom Aspray , Contributor.  Bull and bear on balance scale infographic. Symbol of stock market In over 45 years of following the stock market, I have never heard the term chaos used as a positive for buying stocks. By the Thursday close, the S&P 500 was down over 10%, which was enough to qualify the decline as a correction. In many discussions or comments on the stock market or economy last week, chaos was often mentioned. In discussing the stock market\u2019s decline since the February 19 high the term \u201chistoric\u201d is now frequently used. A Bloomberg comment on Friday noted that \u201cUS stocks just posted their worst start for new administration since the global financial crisis. The dollar is headed for its biggest post-inauguration loss since Richard Nixon began his second term in 1973.\u201d From the bear market low in March 2009 until February 2020 five declines qualified as corrections. They range from 19% in 2011 which corresponded with the U.S. debt crisis in August and an A\/D line bottom in October. S&P 500 2015-2016 In May 2015, the NYSE All A\/D line formed a negative divergence that resulted in a 12% decline that ended in August 2015. That was followed by a 13% decline from 11\/3\/2015 to 2\/11\/2016. A week before the January 2016 low at 1812.29 (line a) the bullish % from the American Association of Individual Investors survey dropped to 17.9% which was below the 18.92% reading at the bear market low on March 5, 2009. During the week of January 15, 2016, the S&P 500 also dropped below the weekly starc- band as it did the following week. These oversold readings increased the odds of a rally. After a two-week rally of 7.4%, the sellers again took over as the S&P reached a low at 1810.10 and the bullish % dropped to 19.24%. The AAII Bull%-Bear% dropped to -29.5% very close to -30 which is viewed as an extremely low reading for bullish sentiment. In reference, it reached 51.4% on March 5, 2009, which was the lowest reading since the recession of 1990 when it reached -54%. The combination of the extremely low bullish sentiment, oversold starc- band analysis, and the bullish signals from the A\/D analysis indicated that an important low was forming in February 2016. This evidence was discussed on Forbes in \u201cThe Week Ahead: Is There Blood In The Streets Yet?\u201d. It was the start of a rally that lasted until January 2018. Spyder Trust with A\/D line So, what about the current technical outlook? The four-week decline has dropped the Spyder Trust (SPY), below its starc- band for the past two weeks. The starc- band was last exceeded in August and April of 2024. SPY also dropped below the yearly pivot at $553.86 with a low of $549.68 but closed above it and also held above the support at line b. The failure of the S&P 500 Advance\/Decline line to make a new high in February created a bearish divergence, line c. The weekly A\/D line is still above its MAs and to confirm the divergence and signal a deeper decline the January low and support at line d would need to be broken. The S&P 500 A\/D line is the only weekly A\/D that is still positive as the NDX 100 A\/D turned negative last week by closing below its WMA but it did confirm the recent highs. The bullish% from AAII on Thursday made a new three-week low at 19.1% and the AAII Bull%-Bear% is at -40.10. This means that the bullish sentiment is lower now than it was at the early 2016 low. This differential bounced to +14 on January 25th to close above its EMA before it started to drop sharply. Nasdaq Composite  Yearly Pivots The Nasdaq Composite was up 100% from the October 2022 lows until the December 2024 high of 20,204. It closed Friday at 17,754 down 12.1% from the December high. The weekly close at 17,750 was just below the YrPivot at 17,797 (in purple) for the first time since April 2023. This could change in the week ahead. The major 38.2% support is still 8% lower at 16,326. The Nasdaq Composite has traded below its weekly starc- band (yellow dots) for the last three weeks in a row. These bands were developed by my old friend, the late Manning Stoller. These bands were designed to contain 90% of the price range so if prices were near the starc+ bands it is a high-risk buy or a low-risk sell as the probabilities would favor a reversion to the mean. Multiple declines below the weekly starc- bands were ideally used to cover short positions. Looking back over the past 10 years the last time this happened for the Nasdaq Composite was during the 5% decline in May of 2019. Before the January 2016 lows, the starc- bands gave a similar warning as did the AAII sentiment data. Markets Despite the over 2% gains in many of the averages on Friday, it was still a rough week. The Dow Jones Transportation Average was the weakest down 6.2% as it is down 7.9% year-to-date just a bit better than the iShares Russell 2000 on a YTD basis. The Dow Jones Industrials lost 3.1% which was worse than the 2.5% decline in the Nasdaq 100 or the 2.3% decline in the S&P 500. The Nasdaq 100 is still up 0.7% YTD but is well behind the SPDR Gold Shares 13.7% YTD gain. According to Bloomberg, this was golds \u201cbest start to a presidential cycle since Jimmy Carter\u2019s term began in 1977\u201d. The daily A\/D lines rose sharply on Friday as over 80% of the stocks in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were higher. It would take another day or two of similar action for the daily A\/D lines to turn positive by moving above their MAs. ETFs & Yearly Pivots So if the market is bottoming which ETFs look the best from a technical standpoint? The table has many of the most popular ETFs with their weekly close and the Yearly Pivots that were recently discussed. These pivots are calculated from the price ranges in 2024. Those ETFs that closed the week below their yearly are highlighted in yellow and as a result, have a questionable major trend. Several like QQQ, VHT and SMH could easily close back above the yearly pivot this week. Others like IWM and XLY are much further below their yearly pivots. The daily analysis of the OBV and RS will identify those ETFs that have the best potential on the long side. My longer-term outlook is still positive for the stock market as long as the weekly A\/D lines do not violate major weekly support. I see two likely scenarios for the next few weeks. One is for a 1-2 week rally back to strong retracement, moving average and pivot resistance before a drop back to or below last week\u2019s lows as a bottom is formed similar to 2016. Given sentiment and oversold extremes another major decline does not look likely after a rebound. The other alternative is a continuation of Friday\u2019s rally that will eventually be strong enough to turn the A\/D line analysis positive while moving the averages above key retracement resistance. Given the current levels of chaos, it is hard to determine a catalyst that could change the sentiment enough besides a truce in the Ukrainian conflict. For this scenario, I would not expect to see more than a one-day decline in the week ahead.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"Businessman working on laptop with PRIVATE EQUITY inscription, new business concept The stock market is currently caught up in its deepest slide since July. We contrarians are prepared to move quickly for deep-dip-buying opportunities. Right now, I\u2019m paying close attention to already-high-paying corners of the market, where we can get 9.4% to 13.1% yields right this very minute. I\u2019m talking about from the business development company industry, where those sky-high yields aren\u2019t rare\u2014they\u2019re the norm. In fact, right now, if we threw darts at a board of BDCs, we\u2019d be likelier to hit a double-digit payout than one in the single digits. BDC Yields But it\u2019s not just the yields I love\u2014it\u2019s the access. BDCs are an \u201caverage Joe\u2019s backdoor\u201d into the world of private equity and private credit. Many small and midsize businesses would love to get funding from traditional banks. But those banks don\u2019t want the risk\u2014so they either refuse to lend to smaller companies, or charge interest rates that would make a loan shark blush. That gap is commonly filled with private equity and credit\u2014investment opportunities that the median investor simply doesn\u2019t have the money to participate in. However, with just $30 or $40, we can buy shares in publicly traded BDCs, which tend to invest in dozens or hundreds of private companies. Said differently: We can invest like private equity for the price of a couple Chipotle burritos. Right now, I want to look at five yielding up to 13.1% that have been acting extremely well so far in 2025. And if we just so happen to get a temporary dip in these BDCs on additional pain in the market, all the better. FS KKR Capital (FSK)Dividend Yield: 13.1% FS KKR Capital (FSK) provides financing to 214 private middle-market companies spread across two dozen industries, including significant exposure to software and services, commercial and professional services, capital goods, and health care equipment and services. While it prefers to deal in senior secured debt, it will also deal in subordinated debt, asset-based finance, preferred equity and plain ol\u2019 equity. Of its debt investments, roughly 90% is floating-rate, though the 10% of fixed-rate debt should help it a little should the Fed begin cutting rates again. Also, roughly 10% of FS KKR\u2019s investments are tied up in Credit Opportunities Partners JV, a joint venture with South Carolina Retirement Systems Group Trust that invests capital across a range of investments. I\u2019ve highlighted FS KKR a few times over the years. In December 2023, I said: Then more recently, in December 2024, I noted that while FSK wasn\u2019t attractive as it was in 2023, a still-deep 10% discount to NAV, declining non-accruals (loans that are delinquent for a prolonged period, usually 90 days), and decent dividend coverage were reasons to give it a closer look. The dividend still looks fine\u2014FSK says it expects to pay $2.80 per share in dividends this year, split between its 64-cent quarterly regular dividend and supplementals. That would put it level with 2024 (backing out the two 5-cent specials it also paid last year). However, non-accruals actually grew during its most recent quarter, to 2.2% at fair value from 1.7% in the quarter prior. While FSK wrote off Miami Beach Medical Group, two companies were added. Meanwhile, FSK\u2019s gains in 2025 have partially come from a further narrowing of its discount to net asset value (NAV), which now sits at just 8%. Sixth Street Specialty Lending (TSLX)Dividend Yield: 9.4% There\u2019s a lot to love about Sixth Street Specialty Lending (TSLX). Sixth Street is a flexible provider of funding to middle-market companies, dealing in senior secured loans, mezzanine debt, non-control structured equity and common equity. It prefers transactions of between $15 million and $350 million, with companies at $50 million to $1 billion in enterprise value generating $10 million to $250 million in annual EBITDA. TSLX\u2019s portfolio currently sits at 115 companies ranging from exciting names like gen-AI provider Sprinklr and human resources support services firm Payscale, to also challenged retailers such as Staples and Bed Bath & Beyond. One of Sixth Street\u2019s classification systems divvies the business up into 16 \u201csector franchises,\u201d which really are a blend of sectors, industries, and strategies\u2014for instance, they include \u201cGrowth,\u201d \u201cSports, Media, Entertainment & Telecom\u201d and \u201cU.S. & European Direct Lending.\u201d Its more traditional industry breakdown is a lot easier to understand: TSLX Portfolio In short, this BDC covers a lot of ground. Sixth Street is up 6% year-to-date, which is better than the BDC average. No surprise there. I\u2019ve noted multiple times that TSLX is a well-managed BDC, and that continues to be the case. In its most recent quarter, adjusted NII topped Street estimates, non-accruals just dropped from 1.9% at fair value to 1.4% in the most recent quarter, and its estimate for $1.97-$2.14 in adjusted net investment income implies that its dividend should continue to be decently covered. Speaking of which: Sixth Street also works within a base-and-supplemental dividend system. Last year, it paid $1.84 per share in regulars, and another 24 cents per share in supplementals. While this kind of system can be murder for investors who actually need income, we\u2019re getting more than 8%\u2014my preferred baseline of retirement income\u2014from the regular dividend alone. But boy, are we paying for it. TSLX is one of the most expensive BDCs on the market, trading at a whopping 29% premium to NAV at current prices. Trinity Capital (TRIN)Dividend Yield: 13.0% The same can be said about Trinity Capital (TRIN), which demands a high price for its alluring business model. Trinity has built itself a niche as a venture-debt firm that deals almost exclusively with growth-stage companies. Its business is broken up into five verticals, shown here: TRIN portfolio It\u2019s hardly an even distribution across those verticals, though. At fair value, 75% of its investments are loans, 18% is equipment financing, and the remaining 7% is equity and warrants. Trinity Capital\u2019s roster is filled with bleeding-edge companies dealing in health wearables, fintech, and medication analytics. Its equipment financing portfolio companies are perhaps the most interesting, including names like launch service and spacecraft component provider Rocket Lab, as well as Athletic Brewing, which is riding the rise of non-alcoholic craft beers. Despite its growthy focus, though, TRIN\u2019s management has been able to whittle down hype and find real substance. Non-accruals are typically low, and sit at a razor-thin 0.8% at fair value right now. It\u2019s also positioned well for a declining-rate environment\u2014only 77% of debt is floating-rate, and of that, 43% of its positions are at the floor. Dividend coverage is often tight, however, and Trinity doesn\u2019t use supplementals\u2014the entirety of its 13% yield is on its quarterlies, which means owners need to keep close watch on NII. I\u2019ve also previously written that this growth profile hasn\u2019t really filtered down into performance, with Trinity mostly just producing industry-average results with more volatility. Well, on the one hand, TRIN has come alive of late, delivering a fat 11% total return so far this year. Much of that stems from an expansion of its premium to NAV, which has ballooned from 9% in December to 18% today. CION Investment (CION)Dividend Yield: 12.7% I won\u2019t spend much time on CION Investment (CION) because I covered it at my recent look at small caps with monster yields. But it still warrants a mention here given both its strength and outrageous discount. CION Investment is an externally managed BDC that targets companies with annual EBITDA between $25 million and $75 million. Its 103 portfolio companies are spread fairly evenly across numerous industries, including business services, healthcare\/pharmaceuticals and media. CION has delivered an 8% return year-to-date to easily beat the industry average, and yet it\u2019s still trading at a deep, deep 23% discount to NAV. One thing I was pleased to see in its just-announced fourth-quarter earnings was a reduction in non-accruals. Back in Q3, non-accruals were 1.9% at fair value, which was higher than its BDC peers (1.4%). However, in Q4, that figure was reduced to just a hair above 1.4%, which is a step in the right direction. SLR Investment (SLRC)Dividend Yield: 9.5% SLR Investment invests primarily in senior secured loans of private U.S. middle market companies, but it does have some specialties. That sentence could be used to describe many BDCs, but SLRC does play in some specialty niches. Here\u2019s a look at its portfolio as of the end of 2024: The risk is extraordinarily spread out for a BDC, too. Its portfolio companies number almost 900 (!), which do business in 110 industries. In 2024, I highlighted SLR Investment as a company that Wall Street just does not like\u2014most of the analysts covering it call it a Hold or a Sell. That\u2019s in part because the stock has largely trailed the industry for some time, but shares finally came to life in late February after the BDC\u2019s quarterly report. SLRC Total Returns However, one of the most common analyst complaints is \u201cearnings clarity.\u201d SLRC has been acquiring more specialty finance portfolios, and the pros just aren\u2019t sure how they\u2019re going to pan out. Also, despite a good chunk of fixed-rate investments (39%), there\u2019s still a lot of question as to how this BDC would be able to absorb further rate cuts. Unfortunately, investors are less incentivized than normal to test the waters. SLRC\u2019s recent burst has closed its NAV discount from double digits just a couple months ago to a mere 5% now. But it\u2019s possible that the pros are too negative on the name. I\u2019ve previously pointed out that SLR Investment has trailed the industry for some time, but that track record is at least improving on the back of better-than-expected quarterly results. And SLRC shares do offer a 10% yield at a 10% discount to NAV. Brett Owens is Chief Investment Strategist for Contrarian Outlook.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"Business Insider Edition  When you are just one unemployed person among millions, networking can be vital.          Career experts say the trick is casting a wide net and knowing exactly what to ask for.               Right now, networking is especially important as the job market is facing cuts in the federal sector, as well as corporate layoffs and lower rates of openings overall.               \"You can't just rely on just applying online now,\" said Stacey Perkins, a career coach with recruitment experience at Korn Ferry, a recruiting and organizational consulting firm. \"There's too many people in the market.\"               Three workplace experts talked to Business Insider about who to talk to, how to expand your network, and what to say in your outreach.               In addition to going to job fairs and conducting the typical outreach to recruiters and workers at companies you're applying to, it can't hurt to tap into your personal social networks. Perkins said to talk to family and neighbors.               \"I think so many times we get stuck on we can only talk to other professional people or people that we used to work with,\" Perkins said.               Brandi Britton, an executive director of staffing firm Robert Half's finance and accounting practice, said after checking out the hiring landscape, make sure your close network is aware you're job searching.               \"Oftentimes, people can refer you to good job opportunities, and you don't even know that the person who's going to refer you to a new job is a contact in your phone,\" Britton said.               Networking doesn't just involve people you often talk to. Andrew McCaskill, a career expert for LinkedIn, said you should reintroduce yourself to people inyour existing network like former coworkers, especially if they work at the companies or industries you are looking at.               He said you can remind someone how they know you, tell them you are interested in the industry they are working in, and describe what you do well. You can also ask them to let you know if they hear about an opportunity at their company or in the field.               Perkins suggested reconnecting with recruiters and anyone in your professional network with whom you had a good relationship. Britton said to follow up with the people you meet at a job fair to demonstrate your interest.               Whomever you reach out to, tell them your skills instead of simply saying you're looking for a position. McCaskill said not to assume people know what you do.               You could also talk to alums even if it's been a long time since you were in college. Britton said it can be a good way to build a connection with someone since you have something in common.               Britton advised against sending out a bunch of LinkedIn messages. She said to create a targeted group of people, such as leaders at companies you're interested in working for. She said they might know of positions not advertised publicly or could make an introduction with another leader at the company.               Britton gave an example of what to say in a cold message:       \"My name is Brandi Britton. I've been interested in your company and getting into your industry. I previously worked at X, Y, Z company for five years and I wanted to conduct an informational interview with you about how you got into your position and see if there are any recommendations you have for me. I'll take no more than 15 minutes of your time if you would be willing to speak with me.\"           Perkins said to first create a relationship before talking about a work opportunity if you are doing cold outreach.               \"Maybe you're asking for more of an informational conversation with them, a meet and greet if you will, before diving right into asking them to refer you for a job,\" Perkins said.               Britton said not everyone wants to say they've been dismissed from their job. However, some people might find it helpful context or feel comfortable putting that information out there. Some Meta and federal workers who were told they were terminated because of performance have talked publicly about their change in employment.               \"If you work for a large company where maybe the layoffs made the news, then you can say, 'I was part of this organization's large layoff, and I'm looking for a new opportunity,'\" Britton said. \"That oftentimes is easier for people to digest.\"               Be careful how you talk about your termination, though. Britton said a common mistake people make when networking is badmouthing their past employer.               McCaskill said how you post online about a layoff is important. He suggested posting with gratitude, optimism, and what you want to do next.               Once you land your next job, that doesn't mean networking is over.               \"I think a lot of people think, 'Oh, I'm only going to do it when I have lost my job, or I'm in need,' that might be too late,\" Perkins said.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"ByJason Kirsch, CFP(R)  ByJason Kirsch, CFP(R) , Contributor.  Apple's services transformation provides a clear path to sustained profitability despite hardware ... [+] challenges, while its capital return program offers downside protection. Apple's trajectory over the next five years may be the most critical period in the company's history. With its nearly $3.2 trillion market cap making it the world's most valuable company, investors face a crucial question: Can Apple continue its impressive growth amid increasing competition, market saturation and regulatory pressures? The iPhone maker's pivot toward services, wearable and emerging technologies suggests a company actively reinventing itself beyond its hardware legacy. This article examines Apple's current business model, financial performance, competitive advantages, and growth catalysts to project where AAPL stock could realistically trade by 2030. I'll explore bullish and bearish scenarios, incorporating data on revenue expansion, profit margins and valuation multiples to offer a comprehensive outlook for investors considering a long-term position in Apple shares. We all know that Apple's vertically integrated hardware, software and services ecosystem has revolutionized consumer technology. At its core, Apple designs and sells premium devices \u2013 iPhones (52% of revenue), Macs (8%), iPads (7%), and wearables including Apple Watch and AirPods (11%) \u2013 with proprietary operating systems that lock users into its ecosystem. This hardware-first approach has evolved significantly, with services now contributing over 25% of revenue through offerings like the App Store, Apple Music, Apple TV+, iCloud, Apple Pay and the Apple Card. The company's business model relies on premium pricing, exceptional user experience, and an integrated ecosystem that increases switching costs for its 2+ billion active devices worldwide. While North America represents 43% of sales, international markets, particularly Greater China (17%) and Europe (24%), have become increasingly essential revenue drivers. Apple's dual focus on hardware innovation and expanding its services segment allows it to capture initial product sales and recurring revenue streams from its loyal customer base, creating a potent financial engine. Apple's strategic shift toward services has dramatically improved its revenue predictability and profit margins. Services generate gross margins exceeding 70%, significantly higher than the company's hardware segment at approximately 35%. This transformation toward higher-margin, recurring revenue streams has been a key factor in Apple's expanding valuation multiples over the past five years, with the company's price-to-earnings ratio rising from the mid-teens to the high twenties. Apple's enduring market dominance stems from several interconnected competitive advantages that have allowed it to maintain premium pricing and customer loyalty despite intense competition. These structural advantages have contributed to Apple's remarkable 48% gross margin and 30% operating margin \u2013 exceptional figures for a company of its size in the hardware space. According to recent consumer surveys, Apple has cultivated perhaps the most potent brand loyalty in consumer technology, with iPhone retention rates consistently exceeding 90%. This loyalty stems from the company's ecosystem strategy \u2013 the seamless integration between devices, software and services creates significant switching costs for consumers. Once users invest in multiple Apple products and services, migrating to competitors becomes increasingly inconvenient and costly. The ecosystem advantage extends beyond consumer psychology into tangible financial benefits. Apple's Services revenue reached $96 billion in fiscal 2024, growing at 15% annually \u2013 significantly outpacing hardware segments. This high-margin business includes the App Store (where Apple collects 15-30% of all transactions), Apple Pay (processing over $1 trillion in transactions annually) and subscription offerings that now count over one billion paid subscriptions across its platform. This ecosystem creates a formidable moat around Apple's business that competitors have struggled to replicate. Despite its massive scale, Apple has maintained its innovation engine through disciplined R&D investment, which reached $30 billion in 2024 (6.2% of revenue). Unlike competitors who often rush unrefined products to market, Apple's approach emphasizes perfecting technologies before release \u2013 entering markets later but with superior offerings that capture disproportionate market share and profits. Apple's current innovation pipeline focuses on several transformative technologies: spatial computing through Apple Vision, AI integration across its product ecosystem, automotive initiatives and health-focused wearables that leverage its enormous user base for healthcare applications. While skeptics point to slowing iPhone innovation, Apple's history suggests its future growth will likely come from categories that don't yet exist or that Apple hasn't yet entered. The company's ability to create entirely new product categories \u2013 as it did with the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and AirPods \u2013 represents perhaps its most valuable competitive advantage. Apple's financial trajectory provides critical insights for projecting its future stock performance. Recent quarters have shown opportunities and challenges that will shape investor returns over the next five years. Apple generated $387 billion in revenue for fiscal 2024, representing a modest 2.8% growth from the previous year \u2013 significantly below its 10-year average of 9.6% annual average. This slowdown reflects challenges in the iPhone segment, which saw just 1.5% growth and declining iPad and Mac sales (-5.2% and -3.1%, respectively). The bright spots have been Services, which grew 15.3% to $96 billion, and wearables, which expanded 6.7% to $42 billion. Profitability metrics tell a more encouraging story, with operating margins expanding to 30.4% from 29.2% the previous year, driven by the shift toward high-margin services and aggressive cost management. Apple's net income reached $100 billion in 2024, with earnings per share growing 8.7% year-over-year, outpacing revenue growth due to the company's ongoing share repurchase program. Free cash flow generation remains exceptional at $115 billion annually, providing ample resources for Apple's capital allocation priorities: R&D investment, dividend growth (currently yielding 0.5%) and share repurchases, which reduced outstanding shares by 3.5% in the past year alone. The pandemic-era surge in technology spending has moderated, creating a challenging growth environment for Apple's hardware segments. However, the company's pivot toward services \u2013 which now contribute 38% of gross profit despite representing only 25% of revenue \u2013 provides a pathway for continued earnings growth even amid slower hardware sales. Analysts project revenue acceleration to 5-7% annually over the next three years as new product cycles and service expansion offset maturing iPhone sales. AAPL shares have delivered a 175% total return over the past five years, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 89% gain during the same period. This performance has been driven primarily by valuation expansion rather than earnings growth \u2013 Apple's forward P\/E ratio has increased from 16x to 28x, reflecting investor confidence in the company's services transformation and recurring revenue potential. AAPL stock has recently experienced increased volatility amid economic and political uncertainty, fears of slowing iPhone sales and potential regulatory headwinds. The shares currently trade approximately 12% below their all-time high reached in Q2 2024, creating what some analysts view as a buying opportunity. The recent correction has compressed Apple's forward P\/E ratio from 32x to 28x, which remains above the S&P 500 average but below many high-growth technology peers. Dividend policy has evolved cautiously, with Apple prioritizing share repurchases over yield. The current dividend of $0.96 annually represents just a 0.5% yield, significantly below the S&P 500 average of 1.5%. However, Apple has increased its dividends for 11 consecutive years, with a 5-year dividend growth rate of 6.2% annually. The company's conservative payout ratio of 15% provides substantial room for future dividend increases, potentially doubling the payout over the next five years while maintaining financial flexibility for investments and acquisitions. Despite Apple's dominant market position and financial strength, several significant risks could materially impact its future performance and stock valuation. These challenges represent essential considerations for long-term investors. The smartphone market, which still drives over half of Apple's revenue, has reached maturation in developed markets with replacement cycles extending from 2-3 years historically to now 3-4 years. Global smartphone shipments declined 2% in 2023 and have remained essentially flat in 2024, creating a challenging growth environment for Apple's core business. Chinese competitors like Xiaomi, OPPO and Huawei have gained significant market share in emerging markets, with devices offering comparable features at lower prices. In the premium segment, Samsung and Google have narrowed the performance gap with high-end devices that compete directly with the iPhone. This intensifying competition has begun to pressure Apple's industry-leading margins, with gross margin in the hardware segment declining 0.8 percentage points year-over-year in the most recent quarter. While ecosystem lock-in provides some pricing protection, Apple's premium pricing strategy faces increasing challenges as the performance differential between flagship phones narrows and consumers become more price-sensitive amid economic uncertainties. Apple faces unprecedented regulatory scrutiny globally, potentially affecting its business model and profit margins. The European Union's Digital Markets Act has forced Apple to open its App Store to alternative payment systems and sideloaded apps, potentially reducing its regional service revenue. Similar legislation is being considered in other jurisdictions, including the United States, where the Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in March 2024, specifically targeting its ecosystem control and App Store practices. The financial impact of these regulatory challenges could be substantial. Analysts estimate that a worst-case scenario of global App Store commission reductions could impact Apple's annual earnings by 7-9%. Beyond direct financial consequences, increased regulatory oversight could restrict Apple's ability to acquire strategic companies, limit its ecosystem control and potentially force changes to its product integration strategies that have historically driven its competitive advantage. These regulatory challenges' timeline and ultimate impact remain uncertain but represent a significant risk factor over the next five years. Projecting Apple's stock price in 2030 requires analyzing multiple scenarios based on revenue growth, margin trends, valuation multiples and capital allocation policies. My base case scenario sees Apple reaching approximately $350 per share by 2030, representing a 7-8% annual return, including dividends \u2013 solid but below its historical performance. This projection assumes 6% annual revenue growth, driven by continued services expansion (12-15% growth), modest iPhone growth (2-3%), and new product categories contributing 5-7% to total revenue by 2030. Operating margins should remain stable at around 30-31% as the scale of services is offset by increased R&D investment and competitive pressures in hardware. Under this scenario, Apple's EPS would reach approximately $12.50 by 2030, with a slightly compressed P\/E multiple of 26x reflecting the company's more mature growth profile. The bull case could see Apple reaching $450-$500 per share, representing 12-15% annual returns. This scenario requires successful entry into new product categories like spatial computing and automotive, AI-driven services expansion and sustained iPhone growth through innovation and emerging market penetration. Service revenue would exceed 35% of total revenue, with margins expanding to 32-33%. A continuation of Apple's aggressive share repurchase program, reducing outstanding shares by 3-4% annually, would further accelerate EPS growth to $15-16 by 2030, potentially maintaining its current premium valuation multiple. The bear case scenario \u2013 investors must consider \u2013 could see Apple's stock price stagnate or decline to the $180-$220 range. This would likely result from smartphone market saturation, regulatory impacts reducing service margins and failure to establish new growth categories. Under this scenario, revenue growth would slow to 2-3% annually, with margins compressing to 27-28%, resulting in minimal EPS growth and potential multiple compression to 20-22x earnings as investors reassess Apple's growth prospects. Bottom Line Apple stands at a pivotal moment balancing extraordinary financial strength against legitimate concerns about future growth catalysts. The company's services transformation provides a clear path to sustained profitability despite hardware challenges, while its capital return program offers downside protection. Investors should expect more modest returns over the next five years than the past decade, with a base case suggesting 7-8% annual appreciation plus dividends \u2013 still attractive in a diversified portfolio. The key factors determining whether Apple outperforms or disappoints will be its success in developing new product categories, sustaining iPhone demand in a maturing market, navigating regulatory headwinds and effectively deploying its massive cash reserves. Long-term investors should maintain positions while being realistic about growth expectations, potentially using market volatility to accumulate shares during pullbacks while closely monitoring the evolution of Apple\u2019s product roadmap and services growth trajectory. My analysis suggests a base case of approximately $350 per share by 2030 (7-8% annual return), with bullish scenarios reaching $450-$500 and bearish outcomes potentially seeing $180-$220 depending on growth execution, regulatory impacts and valuation multiples. Services revenue should grow 12-15% annually over the next five years, reaching $180-$200 billion by 2030 as Apple expands its subscription offerings, financial services, and content business while increasing monetization of its 2+ billion device installed base. The most significant risks include smartphone market saturation limiting iPhone growth, regulatory actions reducing App Store profitability, intensifying competition from premium and value-oriented competitors, and potential failure to establish new product categories that can impact Apple's massive revenue base. Apple's AI strategy \u2013 balancing on-device processing with cloud capabilities while maintaining its privacy-focused approach \u2013 represents both an opportunity and risk. Successful AI integration could drive significant service growth and hardware differentiation while failing to keep pace with competitors like Google and Microsoft could erode Apple's premium positioning and ecosystem advantages. Apple remains among the safest large-cap technology investments due to its exceptional financial strength, loyal customer base, ecosystem advantages and shareholder-friendly capital allocation. However, investors should moderate return expectations compared to the past decade, with future performance likely more closely tracking overall market returns plus a modest premium.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"Is it time for a new flagship Android gaming handheld?  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  If you're in the market for a new flagship Android gaming handheld, you won't have to wait long. Earlier today, it was confirmed that the AYANEO Pocket S2 will make its debut on March 17 at the Game Developers Conference (GDC). This comes almost a year after the original Pocket S was released, which was the first device to launch with the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2. In the announcement post, AYANEO explains that it's \"once again partnering with Qualcomm,\" but doesn't reveal anything else. Towards the end of the post, AYANEO tipped everyone off to a new chip, stating the S2 \"will make its global debut alongside Qualcomm's newest gaming platform.\" There hasn't been much in the way of rumors for the AYANEO Pocket S2, which frankly comes as a bit of a surprise. It's only been six months since the AYANEO Pocket EVO was released, which is powered by the same Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 as the Pocket S. However, besides the internals, the Pocket EVO is a completely different device with its OLED 165Hz display and ergonomic design. That being said, we aren't exactly sure what to expect from the Pocket S2. I wouldn't be surprised if AYANEO kept things simple, and didn't alter the overall design very much to keep it in line with the Pocket S. However, I'm also hoping to see a screen with at least a 120Hz refresh rate, even if AYANEO sticks with an LCD display as opposed to moving to OLED.  Another big question is just how much will the AYANEO Pocket S2 be priced at. AYANEO largely stands alone when it comes to flagship and premium Android gaming handhelds. Pricing for the Pocket S starts at $589, while the Pocket EVO is currently $529 for the base model. Even the recently announced Pocket Micro Classic, a stick-less version of the Pocket Micro, can be currently pre-ordered for $179. On the bright side, AYANEO traditionally offers a bit of a discount during the pre-order phase that usually takes place on Indiegogo. The only difference has been the Pocket Micro Classic which can only be pre-ordered directly. Thankfully, we don't have to wait much longer for AYANEO to spill the details about the Pocket S2. GDC 2025 kicks off on Monday, March 17, meaning we only have to wait a couple of days before everything is revealed.

(Photo by Jaap Arriens\/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Last week, the S&P 500 hit correction territory, which is defined as a 10% decline from a previous high. Stocks rebounded on Friday. So, the S&P 500 sits a little over 8% below its mid-February high, including the more than 2% decline last week. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a drubbing of almost 18% since mid-December. The pressure on stocks seems to come from an economic growth scare, which includes plunging consumer confidence, with additional fuel provided by the policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Returns While some hard data has shown some cracks, the weaker economic data seems to come primarily from soft data, like consumer confidence data. Last Friday, the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index fell to its lowest reading since November 2022. Survey data can be unreliable, though, as consumers often do differently than they say. For example, in 2022, the reading fell well below current levels without triggering a recession. Looking at past periods of depressed consumer sentiment, buying the S&P 500 every time the index fell below 65 led to an average of an 8.4% return over the next 12 months. If you miraculously could forecast the low in consumer sentiment for each cycle, the robust return was an average of 19%, with no losses for a holding period of 12 months. Using 2022 as an example, the consumer sentiment index fell below 65 in February, but buying then would have been too early since the S&P 500 lost another 9.2% in the 12 months following. However, the economy did not fall into contraction, and consumer sentiment hit its low in June, with the S&P 500 posting a 17.6% gain over the next 12 months. Consumer Sentiment Notably, political affiliation seems to be significantly impacting the consumer sentiment index. Democratic consumer confidence has plunged since President Donald Trump\u2019s election. This trend is not abnormal because consumer confidence among Republicans was even worse during some of former President Joe Biden\u2019s term. Last Friday\u2019s results did show a decline in Republican sentiment, so this could become similar to 2022. Consumer Sentiment By Political Party Trump\u2019s use of tariffs has added to the uncertainty surrounding policy. Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. Lastly, the administration can withdraw or focus the tariffs more narrowly if the costs elevate recession risks sufficiently. All other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. While the outcome is unclear, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis composite index of economic policy uncertainty measures policy uncertainty by examining the frequency of media references to it. Given the tariff and DOGE headlines, it is probably not surprising that their U.S. policy uncertainty index is elevated. U.S. Policy Uncertainty According to an analysis by Strategas, stocks tend to do quite well following periods of policy uncertainty. For example, policy uncertainty at current levels has, on average, been followed by over 20% returns from the S&P 500 in the 12 months after. This is entirely consistent with the consumer sentiment data discussed previously, which shows that poor data typically weighs on stocks as readings worsen. Still, the pressure is released once past the point of maximum pessimism. Average Stock Returns During U.S. Policy Uncertainty With the S&P 500 closing over 10% below its February 19 high last Thursday, stocks officially entered a correction. This leaves investors asking whether it will get worse before it gets better. History can help gauge the risks. Looking at 21 U.S. stock market corrections since 1980, the average return in the 12 months following was 13.4%, which on the surface would lead to significant optimism from this point. If the data is sorted between periods when the U.S. economy entered recession within those 12 months after the correction, the results are less compelling at a 1.9% average gain. Of course, if an economic downturn is avoided, the results have been spectacular on average at 19.1%. Average Stock Returns After Stock Correction Looking at the data through the lens of batting average, stocks have been higher in the 12 months following a correction 81% of the time. If there was no recession, the success rate rose to 93% of the occurrences. As one might expect, a recession around the time of the correction causes worse outcomes, with a positive result only 57% of the time. Percentage Of Positive Stock Returns In 12-Months After Correction It can also be helpful to look at the range of outcomes when assessing the risks after a correction. Remember that this data includes two brutal bear markets, 2000 and 2007. The tech bubble burst in 2000, sending the S&P 500 down by almost 50%. Not to be outdone, the 2007 global financial crisis saw stock prices decline by over 56%. Not surprisingly, the worst outcome in the 12 months following a correction was in the 2007 bear market, in which the S&P 500 fell another 34.8% after the initial correction and featured a recession beginning in December 2007. The best outcome was relatively recent in 2023. It followed a 2023 correction, which came on the heels of a growth scare and bear market in 2022, so when the recession was avoided and earnings rebounded, stock soared. Range Of Stock Returns In 12-Months After Correction Since some of this market weakness stems from economic fears, Monday's February retail sales will be an important barometer. Consumer spending is crucial to U.S. economic growth, and January retail sales fell month-over-month. As noted, most of the weaker economic data has been of the soft variety, like consumer sentiment. Two months of tepid retail sales in a row would raise concerns about the durability of the consumer. Retail sales are inexorably linked with employment since income generally drives the ability to spend. Cracks are beginning to show in the employment picture. So, there are downside risks, but retail sales should see some increase month-over-month for February. Consumer Spending & Jobs As the growth scare unfolded and policy uncertainty increased, markets have begun to expect more Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025. In early January, expectations for Fed cuts fell to only one for the year but have increased to between two and three cuts, with the first cut expected in mid-June. The Fed meets on Wednesday, and while no changes to monetary policy are expected, Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s statements will be closely followed. Markets will be keen to judge the timing of the next cut and the committee\u2019s views on inflation and the health of the U.S. economy. Number Of Expected Fed Rate Cuts There are no sure things when it comes to forecasting the short-term movement of stocks. For example, one thing we can learn from the past is that dreadful consumer confidence, high policy uncertainty, and stock market corrections don\u2019t automatically spell doom for the future of stock returns. Long-term, stocks have been the best-performing investment, with an annualized return of 9.9%. The price for this ability to outrun inflation by a sizable margin and compound wealth has been periods of painful and unforeseeable declines. Recent stock declines reinforce the timeless advice to keep enough safe assets to fund short-term expenses. While stocks compound wealth over long periods, they are subject to the whims of sentiment and animal spirits, making them unreliable for short-term liability needs. Unlike in recent years with ultra-low bond yields, high-quality bonds have returned to their historical function of providing income and a safe haven as stocks and other risk assets have declined. Holding a portfolio with enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses can help cushion the impact of any stock declines on a portfolio and allow one to ride out stock declines to experience the benefits of long-term ownership.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"David L. Farquhar on technology old and new, computer security, and more Home \u00bb Retro Computing \u00bb When the dotcom bubble burst 25 years ago, on March 10, 2000, the dotcom bubble reached its peak. The tech-heavy NASDAQ reached its peak that day at 5,048.62, before the bubble burst and stocks went tumbling. Pinpointing when the dotcom bubble burst is harder. But pinpointing when it reached its biggest point is easy.  And while we sometimes call it the dotcom boom and the dotcom bust, it really was more of a bubble. Investors were terrified at missing out on the next Microsoft. And they were convinced the next Microsoft would come out of the dotcom era. One could say they were right. Amazon and Google did emerge from the dotcom era and both outrank Microsoft on the Fortune 500 today. But that took time. It wasn\u2019t clear in 2000 how an online bookseller and a search engine were going to eclipse Microsoft in revenue someday. Nor was it clear they were going to be the ones to do it. The dotcom era was a wild ride. When the NASDAQ peaked on March 10, 2000, it was double its value of a year before. Historically, it takes seven years for a market to double in value on average. So to say the dotcom era was overheated is an understatement. And it\u2019s a misnomer to call it a boom. In a boom, someone\u2019s actually making money. Amazon didn\u2019t have a profitable quarter until Q4 of 2001, and it was a modest profit of $5 million. It didn\u2019t have a profitable year until 2003. Google was more promising, as it was turning profits before its IPO. But Google was the exception. A company didn\u2019t have to be profitable for its stock to boom. Netscape was the poster child for this. It created a necessary product, but Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark couldn\u2019t figure out how to make it profitable. Andreessen is only rich today because he and Clark managed to convince AOL to pay $10 billion for the company before they could finish running it into the ground. Transmeta was another example of a company with interesting technology but no profits. Competing with Intel wasn\u2019t any easier during the dotcom bubble than it was in the years right before it. The stereotypical dotcom business model went something like this: Find something nobody\u2019s selling on the Internet. Register a domain name. Start selling that product on the Internet. Then wait for profits to happen like magic. And without a solid business plan that included things like logistics, those profits rarely happened and typically weren\u2019t sustainable when they did. Just like in any other business. But since this was the Internet, it was going to be different this time, somehow. A generation of billionaires made their fortunes in this era, including Peter Thiel and Mark Cuban. And it seemed like everyone was trying it. Even Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s family. Really. Super Bowl XXXIV also reflected this excess. A total of 14 dotcom companies paid an average of $2.2 million each for a Super Bowl commercial spot. E*Trade\u2019s Super Bowl XXXIV ad exemplified the excess better than any of the others. It showed a chimpanzee lip-synching to La Cucaracha and bragged about having just wasted $2 million. But my favorite dotcom story is Internet America. It was just a random regional provider of dialup service. Its name happened to be two magic words. On December 21, 1999, its share price doubled in spite of there being no news whatsoever about the company on that day. Smart investors cashed out immediately, and many did. In after hours trading it lost 25 percent of its value. It turned out that business on the Internet was like business anywhere else in one regard. Companies without a business plan don\u2019t make it very long. But since investors didn\u2019t mind if a company didn\u2019t have a plan or a path to profitability, it was a house of cards. Just three days after NASDAQ peaked, news of a recession in Japan was enough to tip the balance. And Y2K was over along with its spending boom, so while Y2K money helped send the NASDAQ skyward, it wasn\u2019t there to cushion the fall. Tech stocks started tumbling, and they didn\u2019t pop back up again for years. Some of the companies started failing too. Three of the companies who bought expensive Super Bowl ads, Pets.com, Epidemic.com, and Computer.com, were out of business before the year ended. E*Trade\u2019s Super Bowl XXXV ad made fun of the previous year\u2019s dotcom ads, including directly making fun of Pets.com. It was set in a ghost town, reflecting how many dotcom companies had already failed. E*Trade\u2019s message was clear: The dotcom bubble had burst. The dotcom bubble hurt the tech industry as a whole too. Companies like Sun Microsystems, Compaq, and 3Com all profited selling equipment to these well-funded startups, but as the startups started struggling and going out of business, sales dried up. The wide availability of surplus lightly used equipment drove down demand for their products even further. The aftermath of the dotcom bubble didn\u2019t just turn dotcoms into acquisition targets. Established tech companies became acquisition targets themselves. In some cases, they even sought out acquisition as a matter of survival. It was a long ride down too. The market didn\u2019t bottom out until 2002, and when it did, it fell back to 1997-like levels.\u00a0 It rallied in 2003, only to plateau in 2004. A full recovery took a long time. The NASDAQ didn\u2019t reach a level above 5,000 again until 2015. Google\u2018s 2004 IPO is generally seen as the point when the recovery started. Google intentionally postponed its IPO as a result of the dotcom bust. David Farquhar is a computer security professional, entrepreneur, and author.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":" Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON \u2014 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday that he was \u201cnot at all\u201d worried about the stock market, which has dipped multiple times amid President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threats. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the investment business for 35 years, and I can tell you that corrections are healthy. They\u2019re normal. What\u2019s not healthy is straight up,\u201d Bessent said during an interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \"You get these euphoric markets. That's how you get a financial crisis,\" he added. Major stock indexes have have seen drops in recent weeks amid Trump\u2019s tariff threats. CNBC previously reported that the S&P 500\u2019s value had decreased by about $5 trillion in three weeks. Trump has vacillated on tariffs against Canada and Mexico, two of the United States\u2019 closest trading partners, while threatening steep tariffs on other U.S. allies like the European Union. The president has also implemented sweeping tariffs on aluminum and steel. Bessent also confirmed that Trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on other countries will begin on April 2. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about the markets. Over the long term, if we put good tax policy in place, deregulation and energy security, the markets will do great,\u201d Bessent said. The stock market fluctuations have sparked fears of longer-term economic issues, and Bessent did not rule out a recession in Sunday\u2019s interview. \u201cYou know that there are no guarantees. Like, who would have predicted Covid, right?\u201d Bessent said. \u201cSo I can predict that we are putting in robust policies that will be durable, and could there be an adjustment,\u201d he said, adding that the country needed to be weaned off of \u201cmassive government spending.\u201d Trump had previously declined to rule out the possibility of a recession and acknowledged that Americans may feel some level of economic pain in response to his policies. \u201cI hate to predict things like that,\u201d Trump said in a Fox News interview this month when asked whether he was expecting a recession this year. \u201cThere is a period of transition, because what we\u2019re doing is very big.\u201d The president has also said multiple times that the economy could see some level of \u201cdisturbance\u201d in response to his tariff policies. \u201cTariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again, and it\u2019s happening, and it will happen rather quickly,\u201d he said during his joint address to Congress this month.\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019ll be a\u00a0little disturbance, but we\u2019re OK with that. It won\u2019t be much.\u201d He later repeated that view, telling NBC News that \u201cthere could be some disturbance, a little bit of a disturbance.\u201d Trump later appeared to backtrack on his recession comments, saying last week that he did not \u201csee it at all\u201d when asked again whether there could be a recession. Trump also said the stock market sell-off did not concern him, adding he was \u201cvery optimistic about the country.\u201d Bessent on Sunday urged Americans to watch how countries react in the two months following the start of reciprocal tariffs in April. \u201cEither the tariff barriers come down, the U.S. can export more. Trade is fairer. It\u2019s always been free, but not fair,\u201d Bessent said. \u201cOr if they don\u2019t do it, we\u2019ll take in substantial revenues.\u201d Bessent also addressed cuts to the IRS after the Trump administration initiated a large-scale federal workforce reduction, including widespread cuts of probationary employees. The treasury secretary said the IRS had approximately 15,000 probationary employees who could have been fired, but \u201cwe kept about 7,500, 8,500 because we viewed them as essential to the mission.\u201d Late last week, two federal judges ordered the Trump administration to temporarily reinstate thousands of fired probationary workers.

The feel is wonderful to the skin and if you're looking for something more on the bigger side this is the right one for you. I generally prefer dildos with a more narrow head, so if you're like me you may have a hard time (pun intended) getting this one in but I took on the challenge. I just had to get very lubricated and extra turned on in order to fit this big boy, but in the end I had that feeling of fullness that I was looking for accompanied by the amazing texture from the toy and ended up coming super hard and feeling completely satisfied.

Didn't need any lube or prep, just this massive wand. I really highly recommend this thing. It's great for everyone!!!\" \u2014Robin Reads Get it from Amazon for $129.95. Only want the best?

Promising reviews: \"Amazing!! This thing is surprisingly\u00a0quiet\u00a0and VERY effective. The vibrations are comparable to the \u201cMagic Wand\u201d Massage Wand, if not more. This exceeded all my expectations and surprised me in the best way. I had been slightly worried since I read some reviews saying it was too loud, but I had no issues at all. The noise control was perfect. If you have your door shut, no one would be able to hear it at all. This is quite possibly one of the best toys I\u2019ve purchased. Thank you!\" \u2014Vivian S. \"Amazing product, especially for first-time users. The petals are also lovely which I wasn\u2019t expecting! It\u2019s quiet, so need to worry about that if that\u2019s a concern, and easy to clean as well. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for something effective and also pretty!\" \u2014Kate G. Get it from Vush for $68.79\u00a0(originally $85.99). Promising reviews: \"Experienced user here so started with the largest, slipped right in with minimal effort, put on a thong to help keep it from popping out and have been rockin' it the past six hours, only wish they made a next size up set!\" \u2014RandomGuy \"Bought these for my girlfriend and she loves them! And so do I! They are very comfortable and come in the correct size for those that want to take their love life to a new level. If you are new, start with the small size and work your way up. This product is perfect as you can start small and move up as you become more comfortable.\" \u2014Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $7.99+\u00a0(available in seven colors). Ah, good ol' Puff. *sighs dreamily* Every time I think I have found a new favorite sex toy, I go back to this one and am reminded all over again why I love it. There's only five intensities: simple, to the point \u2014 and I like to start at 3 and end at 5. It's incredible for edging, if you want to enjoy a longer session and it's also perfect for quickies. It's my go-to shower toy because it's waterproof, and I have actually considered just leaving it in the bathroom, but I won't. True story: it died on me the other day mid-session for the first time (I've had it for over a year and maybe charged it...twice?), so the battery lasts longer than you for the most part. Anyways, this is the toy I recommend to all of my friends and I have several who own it, and it's also the toy I recommend to random strangers I meet who are looking for new ways to come because yes...when you're a sex toy writer, that's a thing that happens. If you need to know more about this sex toy and why I personally love it, make sure to read my Unbound Puff review. Promising review:\u00a0\"I\u2019m new to all of this. My friends literally raved about Puff for a year before I finally decided to get one. I did not know\u2026I could feel like that. It is amazing. It took me some time to fully utilize the suction feature in the puff, but the vibration itself is *chefs kiss*. I also used it once during sex with my boyfriend and phew!!! I don\u2019t even know if I have any words. Great for beginners!\" \u2014B. Get it from\u00a0Unbound\u00a0or Amazon\u00a0for $48 (available in quartz and mint). Yes, it's waterproof, so you can go ahead and play with it in the shower. Promising reviews: \"Love the product, my first purchase of a masturbator, very snug and stimulating. I don't consider myself very big girth-wise, but this is very snug yet 'adaptable.' It is extremely stimulating after orgasm as the toy stays tight around your very sensitive head, shaft, etc. Appears very durable, use water-based lube. 'Sucking' sound is rather stimulating depending on how you hold\/use the toy. Easy to clean, pliable.\" \u2014Terry \"First toy for husband, he was really surprised at how nice it felt. We did parallel play to get him comfortable. Unbelievably soft but firm enough for resistance. Easy to clean \u2014 we have some light fabric towels to pull from one end to the other to get fully dry.\" \u2014Ashwdwrd Get it from Amazon for $24.99+\u00a0(available in four colors). No, the Fleshlight is not included. But this positioning pillow is specifically designed for Fleshlight users who want to explore missionary position solo. If you're into doggy style, don't worry because there's a pillow for that! The faux-leather design offers a sleek look and easy cleanup afterward. One reviewer recommends using a Fleshlight Flight toy with this pillow, if you don't have one already. Promising reviews: \"Was worried about buying this at first, comes in a brown box unmarked, I will say that this is a great investment. Thought about it for a while but man this thing beats normal masturbation with a flesh light by far. It will stick a little bit out the front but not enough to really bother you. Make sure you wash it after every use, Lysol wipes will work fine for temp, but put it in the wash every now and again so it doesn't smell. This thing is worth it, and whenever I have a dorm inspection everyone just thinks it's a pillow with a drink holder in it.\" \u2014Ziphen \"Amazing, not worth buying a Fleshlight without it. I shoot seven bags into this thing on a daily basis... shit is so cash.\" \u2014Alex Get it from\u00a0Amazon for $139.99. There are seven patterns in the shaft and seven intensities in the external arm, not to mention this toy is waterproof and versatile (AKA, yes, you can get in a different position and get a rim job if you want). Promising reviews: \"My new favorite! It vibrates on both ends and you can change the settings so they both vibrate at different times. Long battery life. 10\/10 recommend.\" \u2014Danielle L. \"Love it! Super soft to the touch. Gets the job done as you like it. Many different options as the rotator and licker can be on separately and reach having several setting. Feels great and relieves stress! The licker makes almost no noise. The rotator however is a little louder... the rotator's not very discreet. Love that it is waterproof as well since I love a hot soak in the bubble bath!!\" \u2014Candance S. Get it from Honey Play Box for $59.99 (available in three colors). With 3.5 inches of insertable length and a width of 1.25 inches, this sleek plug was designed to satisfy. Promising reviews: \"I had never thought much about using this toy because I'm a cis woman and therefore have no prostate, for which this product is designed. I was so thrilled to discover that I could enjoy it too... The weight of the Pfun Plug feels AMAZING. The handle makes it easy to manipulate, and you can get great indirect g-spot stimulation when you use it anally. You can also try it vaginally for more direct g-spot contact. Because it's so easy to sterilize (just boil for five minutes), you can easily switch partners or orifices... The stainless steel adapts easily to warm or cool water for temperature play. This is a must-have butt toy for all bodies.\" \u2014Anonymous \"Most people fear stainless steel, but DON'T BE AFRAID! Stainless steel is AMAZING! I call this my lazy toy, because the weight does the work for you. It's sleek, smooth and comfortable. You can wear it out on the town and no one will know! Not only is it great for butts, but you can even it use it vaginally. Amazing when wearing anally while also being penetrated vaginally. You can also do temperature play with stainless steel!\" \u2014Queen Get it from Babeland for $99.99 or Amazon for $56.90. Make a night out of it with the Bringing Sexy Bath kit, which includes a Water Slyde, massage candle, arousal balm, hair towel wrap and privacy door hanger, so you can enjoy your me-time without interruption. Promising reviews: \"Know what, I was skeptical about it. But I really like how easy it is to use. Imagine being your very own pillow princess. You tell yourself to just relax and enjoy it. It\u2019s empowering and refreshing. You could have your hands free for whatever \u2014 for an additional stimulant, for a good book, for anything on your phone, to massage a hair mask into your hair \u2014 or you could literally just kick back, because it does the trick on its own too.\" \u2014Anonymous \"I had been eyeing the Water Slyde for a few years and finally made the purchase! It did not disappoint. It's easy to use and I like how I can just comfortably lay down in the tub. Highly recommend!\" \u2014Anonymous Get it from Lovability for $35 (available in three colors). Spot is designed with water-resistant, soft-touch silicone. The toy includes a charger and carrying case for discretion. Promising reviews: \"For background: I\u2019m a 22-year-old woman and have owned 6\u201310 sex toys in my life. This one\u2019s awesome and my favorite. For one: it isn\u2019t purple. Why is every vibrator purple? Second, it\u2019s only straight vibration so no patterns to awkwardly click through. Next thing I love: it\u2019s so pretty. And such a good size! Not too big, but not too small. Alright finally, the brand itself is so simple. The colors are simple and aesthetic. The design of the spot is pared down to fulfill what you want without any extra shitty extras. When every other vibrator is a jack of all trades, the Spot vibrator is the master of one \u2014 and I adore them for it. I love it. :)\" \u2014Kathryn M. \"Firstly, I got to say that I love the design! It's so minimalistic that I can display it like a piece of art on top of my nightstand. Its shape is subtle, as with all of Maude's sex toys, that I had to point out that it was in fact a sex toy for a friend to realize what it was by my bed! Lastly, it delivers! Both in its name and its performance, it really hits the spot. I orgasmed twice in one sitting with the help of this toy. Cheers, Maude!\" \u2014Louis K. Get it from Maude for $79 (available in grey and green). Or grab the newer Bess 2 (also on Amazon), which includes an anal bead attachment and a heating element! Promising reviews: \"Beautiful, quality and you can't get bored with the different attachments. Very easy to keep clean which is high on my list. Perfect for multi-orgasmic people!\" \u2014Yvonne P. \"I already own the Hero from the Zalo Legends line and was so impressed with the overall quality and elegance of the toy I was dying to buy another Zalo product.\u00a0I love the attachments which make this toy versatile and the two separate motor heads in both ends of the toy. The Bess is absolutely stunning. The quality and workmanship is unparalleled (and this is coming from someone who only buys luxury brand sex toys). So far the little silicone ball attachment is my favorite. What makes the Bess stand out to me beyond what I already mentioned was that not only does it offer numerous strong vibration speeds but the different patterns are to die for. My only warning is start on the lowest setting its a big jump in strength to the next setting and learn the settings before you try it out.\" \u2014S. L. Get it from Zalo\u00a0or\u00a0Amazon\u00a0for $99\u00a0(available in three colors). This plug is also completely waterproof and submersible! Promising reviews: \"This is an amazing product! As a trans woman, I find it's incredibly hard to find toys that work for me as I don't yet have a *cough* front hole. This one does the trick! It's genuinely changed my experience with any toys I use, as well as making going into the shower an enjoyable and fun experience. Any other trans-women out there looking at this toy: do it! It'll do the trick, I can pretty much guarantee it. \u2014K.S. \"Dude, this lil' booty buzzer rocks my world. It's so smooth 'n' cute 'n' really gets the job done. This is my first plug, and I would recommend it for newbies like myself. I was nervous when I felt the vibration settings in my hand out of the box, but once it's in there the settings are really great and the low ones are definitely not too much. Highly recommend!\" \u2014L.Q. Get it from Unbound\u00a0or Amazon\u00a0for $62. Seven powerful vibration modes in the shaft and rabbit ears along with flexible anal beads offer a lot of stimulation whether you like to use your toys alone or with a partner, for foreplay or the entire session. A magnetic charger helps ensure a waterproof seal so you can use it in the shower or bath. Promising review: \"When I say this gave me life, took it, and gave it back again... \ud83e\udd74 It was everything I wanted and then some. I was really impressed by the touch and feel of it \u2014 it was very silky-like, then the vibration settings OMG. It takes no time or effort to clean it.

The sides are flexible allowing for growth and the vibration is perfect to get up and stay up for the 60 minutes of the battery life...\" \u2014Sailor \"Ok, so we know there's stigma around [people with penises] using toys, but you know what? Why should [vagina-owners] have all the fun? This is the first toy I've come across that feels respectful and sensual in its design. It feels good to the touch, and stimulates incredibly.

The tall pyramids are just genius and combined with vibration \u2014 phew!\" \u2014Melanie \"Perfect! If you\u2019re intimidated by the spikes and other larger-looking options, don\u2019t be! I hesitated because I tend to grind down very hard, but the material is slippery and soft, yet impressively durable.\" \u2014Mina Kirby Get it from Godemiche for $38.16+\u00a0(available in nine styles and four color options). Promising reviews: \"Velvet has a great reputation with soft feeling sex toys and this one lives up to that reputation. I was skeptical about this toy at first because of the curvature\/hook look, however I realized how easy it was for it to hit my G spot. And WOW. I didn't have to angle the toy as much as my other ones to get this to hit my G-spot and it was great. Plus, with its fast setting of its strokes, it felt great. Going to be my new go-to toy whenever I want instant pleasure.\" \u2014Bree \"Really all I can say! Suction cup is awesome and it really has some significant thrust to it. A lot more than I expected. Only comment is the G-spot stimulator is a little bit hook like, not sharp or snagging on anything but definitely has an edge. If that could be rounded out entirely I think it would be the perfect toy!\" \u2014Anonymous Get it from Velvet Co. Thruster for $182\u00a0(available in four colors).

All I had to do was send an invite to my bf and he instantly was able to connect and control this thing. AMAZING!!\" \u2014Rachael M. \"I use mine on Chaturbate mostly.

Super comfy, sometimes I forget I have it in.\" \u2014Vallaria Get it from Amazon for $129. It's also waterproof and includes a travel-friendly case for when you want to take it on the go! FYI, Some reviewers say that it doesn't work well for anyone with above average girth, so make sure to take into account the measurements! Promising reviews: \"I have several toys of this type, but this one is definitely the very best. Might make your eyes pop out of your head while you use it!!! Mm, mmm good!

This was with the first time I used it. It was with a partner. She performed oral and used the Quickshot simultaneously like intended. I don\u2019t think she has ever seen my body spasm the way she made me bust. Definitely recommend this toy. It\u2019s the perfect texture, its nice and tight, and it\u2019s easy to clean\/store.

I was intimidated by it because it looks [wild], but it's super pliable and the silicone is the best texture. It works exactly as advertised. I love that the two vibrating areas are individually controllable because if you want to get done quick, you can use both, but if you want to stretch the whole event out, you can set the internal part to vibrate and just use the pressure of the external part. I own a lot of toys, and this one has become a fast favorite.\" \u2014Wally Get it from Babeland for\u00a0$149.99\u00a0or Amazon for\u00a0$108.90+\u00a0(available in three colors).

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"Business Insider Edition  Washington's tariff threats are real but not the only problem: the continued counter-responses from other countries have turned this trade war into a vicious cycle that makes it hard for any seasoned economist to call the endpoint. And that type of ambiguity is making markets nervous.          There has been a significant reevaluation of risk and a sentiment shift to the downside for markets, said Jim Baird, the chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors. He services clients with net worths beginning at $500,000, which he calls the \"millionaire-next-door\" type. In other words, they aren't yet in the ultrawealthy range where they can sit a downturn out or resort to private investments.               This group of investors has enough exposure to public markets that it could seriously impact their wealth. It's a predicament that has put money managers at the forefront of rethinking their clients' exposures relative to their needs amid a rapidly shifting economic environment.               Baird isn't expecting a near-term recession but is concerned about the risk of stagflation, when inflation and unemployment both remain high. For that, he's assessing whether clients have enough cash to cover their monthly needs and any big payments they may have coming up. This helps them avoid selling equities when the market is down. It's typically known as the emergency fund. But clients who are retired or nearing retirement should aim to have six to 12 months of their needs in cash. As for those who still have a wage and aren't worried about losing it, carrying too much cash doesn't make sense, he added.               He is also coaching clients on strategic asset allocation while reviewing their portfolio positioning. When the stock market is volatile, it could be an opportunity to move some positions around, he noted. But those decisions would be made based on an individual client's needs. For example, if they don't have enough exposure in large caps, this could be a time to top that position while offloading other areas that could be used for tax-loss-harvesting purposes.               \"Coming off of the last few years, equity investors, in particular, have done pretty well,\" Baird said. And so they may be in a decent position to reduce portfolio risk without risking their ability to meet their long-term goals and objectives.\"               For those who don't want to take too much risk on stocks or are already dependent on their investment portfolio, he advises them to lean into high-quality bonds that still provide a good enough yield. But he doesn't suggest longer-duration bonds in case there's an uptick in inflation.               Ken Mahoney, the CEO of Mahoney Asset Management, advises those with net wealth between $1 million to $ 10 million in assets. He has been helping clients trim some of their positions since late last year and into 2025. But not because of the trade wars, per se: He was concerned that the stock market hadn't seen a correction in some time and expected a 10% pullback at some point.               While things look gloomy right now, he's also prepared for a large change in the president's tone and policy that could bring markets flying back. His strategy with clients has been to remain tactical while watching for positive signs of change.               For those who feel like they missed the curve and the market has already turned for the worst, Mahoney says it's not too late. Investors can still make some tactical moves. Just see this as a time when the good stuff is on sale and go shopping for high-quality stocks.               He expects a rally back into Big Tech stocks like Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia when the market begins to recover\u2014 although he can't guarantee when that will happen. But since these names are the most liquid stocks, institutions will add them back into their portfolios as fast as they offloaded them, he said. These companies are also supported by strong fundamentals, big balance sheets, and hefty cash, and they remain key to long-term technological innovations.               However, there's still risk in the market, which means sectors like small caps may not be the place to go looking for sales. Mahoney is only sticking to the Mag 7 and potentially other stocks with relative balance sheet strength.               \"We are growth managers, so that is where we will stay focused in looking to nibble at tech, and the key word there is nibble as this is not a place to get aggressive at all,\" Mahoney said. \"We like to buy high and sell higher and buy confirmed strength more in the markets we had in 2023 and 2024.\"               Once the indexes start making higher lows, Mahoney would consider becoming slightly more aggressive because it's an early sign that the selling pressure is subsiding. Another sign he'll be looking for is the cooling off of the CBOE Volatility Index, a measure of the S&P 500's expected volatility.               In the meantime, for investors looking for broader exposure, he suggests dollar-cost averaging \u2014 buying fixed amounts at regular intervals \u2014 into the indexes if they have time to stay in the market. That's because once we correct, you can gain an extra 10% from the reversal, Mahoney noted. And if we remain in freefall, that means more shares at a lower price, he added.               That said, you'll want some cash or what Wall Street calls \"dry powder\" to set aside so you can buy. He recommends keeping that cash in money markets that can be liquidated at the par value of $1 at any point, making them a more flexible option over bonds.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"Business Insider Edition  It was late Wednesday night inside a crowded Las Vegas nightclub at the closing party for HumanX, a new conference focused on AI, when Wyclef Jean, wiping the sweat from his face after performing for more than an hour, walked offstage into the crowd.          He finished his set, snaking through a crowded sea of people patting Jean on his shoulders and snapping selfies on their iPhones.               At a conference all about AI, the thousands of attendees who paid $995 to $3995 for a ticket still craved human connection, whether it was brushing up against a Haitian rap legend, mingling at the seemingly endless happy hours celebrating new AI startups, or getting to meet face-to-face with a famous venture capitalist.               \"It's unlikely a Midwestern CTO at a manufacturing company is ever going to be sitting in a room with Vinod Khosla,\" Stefan Weitz, the co-founder, and CEO of HumanX, told me, referring to the founder of Khosla Ventures, who was one of the first investors in OpenAI. \"That's really why you come to an in-person conference.\"               Khosla joined Hugging Face co-founder Thomas Wolf, Superhuman founder and CEO Rahul Vohra, OpenAI CTO Kevin Weil, and dozens of other speakers who participated in intimate Q&A roundtables. They were HumanX's most popular sessions, with lines sometimes stretching more than 400 people to get a seat.               \"When my team first pitched me the idea, I thought there was no way our big speakers were going to do a Q&A with random people, but 100 said 'yes' on the spot,\" Weitz said. \"To be in a room with Kevin [Weil] and when he can literally look in the eyes of people that are using his product every day and asking questions as a product person, that's really powerful.\"               Weitz, a former longtime senior director at Microsoft, founded HumanX with event producer Jonathan Weiner \u2014 who previously launched mega conferences HLTH, Shoptalk, and Money20\/20.               They wanted to capitalize on the tech obsession of the moment and raised $6.2 million in venture funding from Primary Ventures, Foundation Capital, and FPV Ventures, which is helpful because events like these usually take years to become profitable.               \"The food and beverage alone is multiple millions of dollars,\" Weitz said. \"We knew we were going to lose money in year one.\"               Next year's event will pack in twice as many attendees and be held in San Francisco.               \"80% of the funding last year in AI went to Bay Area companies,\" Weitz said. \"I think we'll have even more amazing speakers because it's a schlep to get here.\"               To reach this year's HumanX, I had to make my way every morning through the cavernous 150,000-square-foot casino at the new Fountainbleau Las Vegas, walking past beeping slot machines and vacationers sipping free drinks at the craps table.               I asked Jai Das, president and partner at Sapphire Ventures if he had time to play any blackjack in between speaking on stage and meeting with founders and other VCs.               \"I don't gamble,\" Das said. \"I gamble enough with my LPs money.\"               It was hard to miss the metaphor of what is happening in venture investing right now \u2014 investors betting billions on AI companies, hoping they will hit the jackpot even as few payouts happen because the IPO market has been largely frozen.               \"Let's call the whole ecosystem to task,\" Katelin Holloway, founding partner at 776, said on stage. \"The valuations are so inflated it doesn't make sense to go public.\"               If that all sounds nerve-wracking, perhaps that is why, next to the main stage, there was a speakeasy, massage booth, and a small dog park where attendees could pet well-behaved pooches while listening to panels featuring Anthropic CPO Mike Kreiger, Sequoia partner Alfred Lin, and former Vice-President Kamala Harris.               \"It was a good break to disconnect from the craziness of the conference,\" said Steffan Mos, a sales manager at Vectera who took a few minutes to linger at the dog park with his CEO. \"It brings the human element to the HumanX conference.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"PC gaming isn't cheap anymore thanks to inflation and scalpers  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  If you've read my previous articles, you should know that PC is my preferred option for gaming. Whether it's with handheld gaming PCs or a full-fledged desktop setup, I believe it offers the best gaming experiences possible with better performance and advanced graphics options. There's also a much greater level of freedom PC players have over console players: lower game prices thanks to digital marketplaces, free multiplayer online access (which shouldn't even be a debate), and modding capabilities all play an integral part. I can't deny that PC gaming isn't cheap, but there also isn't much of an argument when looking at the likes of the PS5 Pro and its $699.99 \/ \u00a3699.99 \/ AU$1,199 price - as I've said before, you may as well start saving for a PC build at that price point. However, my stance on that has changed at least for the time being - not because I think consoles are more powerful than most PCs, no - but because the current landscape of the GPU market is an absolute mess. Nvidia and AMD both launched new GPUs: the Blackwell RTX 5000 series and Radeon RX 9000 series respectively, and getting your hands on any of these graphics cards at MSRP (or even at all) is one heck of a mission. From scalpers to retailers, you'll more than likely find yourself overpaying for a new mid-range or high-end GPU. Now it's worth mentioning that Intel is also in the mix with its Battlemage Arc B570 and B580 GPUs, but it's got some catching up to do against Team Green and Team Red in terms of performance capabilities and its XeSS upscaling method. Ultimately, it means that if there was any opportunity for a large amount of console-only gamers (or even new gamers entirely) to join the PC platform, that chance is nearly dead in the water - and I don't see it getting better anytime soon.  It's important I note that I absolutely don't expect powerful graphics cards to be cheap, especially considering the advancement of tech and power capabilities we've seen over the years from Nvidia and AMD. Game developers are now able to provide exceptional and immersive gaming experiences with hyper-realistic visuals, thanks to the power provided by GPUs like the RTX 5090. This is even possible with midrange cards at high resolutions, with the help of upscaling tools like DLSS and FSR. What I do expect, however, is for hardware to be affordable, especially with less powerful products - and unfortunately, that's the complete opposite of what we're seeing. Examples of this are evident with the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080: both of these Blackwell GPUs are high-end offerings, priced at $1,999 \/ \u00a31,939 \/ AU$4,039 and $999 \/ \u00a3999 \/ AU$2,019 respectively, and will give gamers the best performance possible this generation. Those prices are arguably too high, particularly when the leap from the previous flagship GPU, the RTX 4090, is significant but perhaps not enough to pay another $400 above its $1,599 MSRP. When you add scalpers, low stock, and hardware issues into the equation, it makes matters worse - and we've seen this occur since board partners are selling the GPUs at inflated prices. It means either you won't find a GPU to buy at all, or if you do, you'll more than likely be overpaying. You might be thinking it's best to just buy a midrange GPU, but the exact same thing is happening there too. AMD's Radeon RX 9070 series GPU prices have seen a sudden hike - so instead of paying $599 \/ \u00a3569 \/ around AU$944 for the RX 9070 XT, you'll be paying much more. It's also worth noting that PC games are released with bad optimization - so even if you do manage to find a powerhouse GPU without overpaying, you'll have to deal with bad performance and game-breaking bugs.  As a gamer who is on both PC and console, I can totally understand why most console players are hesitant when advised to build gaming PCs. Yes, I still think PC is the better platform and there's plenty of freedom to be had with your gaming experience - but if you can't even acquire the right hardware at affordable prices, what choice do you have but to stick with a console? Again, you may end up building your desired gaming PC and then still be met with frustrating performance problems. While performance may not be as good on console, it's a manageable experience with stable frame rates that come without the need to tinker or mess around with settings. I believe it's a big part of why handheld gaming options like the Steam Deck are so popular: gamers can simply select a game they want to play (with the help of Deck Verified) and dive in. It's not like that isn't the case on Windows PCs, but it's annoying dealing with regular performance drops due to bad optimization, along with Windows 11 and its game incompatibility problems. Gamers just want to be able to purchase the right hardware and get their money's worth while gaming - and if PCs can't provide that right now because of GPU price inflation, then I can't blame anyone for sticking with a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S.

This criticism comes from a place of love. All the writing on this blog is licensed CC-BY-SA to allow others to take the texts and do something with it: I release my work under those conditions because I believe that we need strong and rich commons to flourish as a society but also as communities, groups and individuals. I\u2019ve also been running my own personal systems (servers, my own laptops and a few other systems) on Linux for more than 20 years now. I am deeply embedded in the space of open culture but also Free and Open Source Software. This morning I made a bit of an off-hand remark that summarized a few thoughts going on in my head:  People within the Open* movements have done the impossible, have created whole encyclopedias, the most successful and most used kernel on the planet and a metric fuckton of custom, optimized operating systems,  software libraries, and user facing programs. Have contributed to the commons to a degree that wouldn\u2019t even have been credible within science fiction stories. Some of these systems \u2013 and I am not kidding here \u2013 should be considered the digital wonders of the world. So why have we not \u201cwon\u201d? Wikipedia might be considered to have won: By now it is the default digital source of information for large parts of the planet when trying to get to mere facts. But Wikipedia is an outlier in that regard.  Using Statcounter\u2019s metrics Firefox \u2013 the Open Source browser that is not depending on what Google\u2019s ad department wants to do \u2013 currently (March 2025) has a market share of 2.63%. And sure mobile platforms and Apple\u2019s anti-competitive strategies when it comes to mobile have made it harder but even on desktops it\u2019s just 6.3%. That\u2019s absolutely not nothing, it\u2019s millions of people. But not exactly something that shifts any sort of power and influence away from tech giants. Again using Statcounter, Linux has a desktop market share of about 4%. Which is a lot given how hard the main competitors Microsoft and Apple are making the life of Linux developers and distribution builders. But still not even close to being an actually relevant player in the market for most purposes. Which everyone using Linux feels daily when asking for certain software vendors to release Linux versions of their stuff: \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it.\u201d I got a great response to the Mastodon post I embedded above: First: R.L. Dane is completely right in their description about how \u201cOpen Source\u201d is kind of the corporate version of \u201cFree Software\u201d. \u201cOpen Source\u201d tried to strip the little politics that \u201cFree Software\u201d as a concept carried to make the whole scene more digestable to corporate entities (in any meaning of the word). Second: I believe that they also nailed who Free Software is for. Quote: What we call #FOSS today was originally for hackers by hackers. For hackers by hackers. And I am afraid that we haven\u2019t moved enough past that mindset. That\u2019s 100% not saying that nothing happened. A big deal has happened. Think of Outreachy that tries to get more people from diverse backgrounds  internships to work on open source and build a career in software. Think of PyLadies who have put in so much work to give more women the opportunity and a safer path towards becoming active contributors into the Python ecosystem. And there are so many, many activities like that. So much work so many technical communities put into making the path towards becoming a member easier, more inclusive, fairer, etc. Those activities are fundamentally about fulfilling the Open Source promise: To give everyone the ability to have control over the software they use and the tool to build upon what\u2019s already there. Mission \u2026 not accomplished but on its way, right? But what are we doing? What are we trying to help \u201ceveryone\u201d with? We are trying to give more people the opportunity to \u201cbecome hackers\u201d. So they can profit off of all this stuff built by hackers for hackers. This isn\u2019t a project to free all of us, it\u2019s a project to give everyone a degree of freedom if they join our club. If they assimilate. This is Borg-mode. We are not meeting people where they are. We expect them to come to us in order to understand why our values matter and are the best. Which \u2013 sorry to have to say so \u2013 they are not. In 1971 the black civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer coined the phrase Nobody\u2019s Free Until Everybody\u2019s Free. And we have not taken that to heard. Because it does not say \u201cNobody\u2019s Free until everyone is like us and then we have tools to create some freedoms\u201d.  This is why so many outreach programs don\u2019t work. Because what we are selling isn\u2019t a solution to people\u2019s actual problems but a new identity. And most people already got one of those. Now the solutions we propose might actually help our target audience with a real problem that they are faced with but so often our narratives don\u2019t connect to their realities. We\u2019re stuck in our own heads. Our own mechanisms and traditions. I keep realizing and feeling this being stuck whenever I talk about moving beyond Open Source and Licenses and all that. I get a lot of responses arguing for example that \u201cif you restrict people to not use your software for war you are no longer compatible with Freedom 0 and are no longer Free Software\u201d as if that mattered. Yeah sure, that\u2019s the legal regiment we\u2019ve built. And where has that got us? Are we happy here? Is that enough? Is me being able to customize my systems to my needs good enough? I recently changed a lot of my infrastructure to depend less on US companies and service providers for the simple reason that currently hosting stuff in the US (digitally but also physically) does not feel save. I can do that. Can my dad? My neighbors? Is that their fault? In motherfucking 2013 I wrote: Telling people to \u201chost your own\u201d when some big company closes or buys a service is very similar to the princess who, when learning that the peasants had no bread, said: \u201cLet them eat cake.\u201d Hosting your own is a solution for the gifted and wealthy few, for many it\u2019s blatant cynicism. I stand by that. We need to get out of our comfort zones and modes of operation. Need to move beyond the seemingly apolitical cyberspace of free licenses. We need to reshape our thinking towards more political goals and values.  Maybe then non-hackers might also give a shit.

Moreover, the work to spread it has also to be discussed by means of the new institutional economics. See https:\/\/plinubius.de\/tag\/olson1992\/ #Kollektivgut #publicgood I very much like your assessment that \u201c[t]his is why so many outreach programs don\u2019t work. Because what we are selling isn\u2019t a solution to people\u2019s actual problems but a new identity.\u201d I also full-heartedly support your stance on \u201cself-hosting\u201d. Yet, there are several problems with your Mastodon post, criticizing CC for not \u201cbuilding more modular licenses that do for example prohibit training \u201cAI\u201d systems.\u201d  Interestingly, the reason for having modular licenses in the first place was actually the \u201cmarket-based, liberal idea\u201d of allowing license users freedom of choice. (This is why, initially, CC had even more license versions, including a \u201cSampling license\u201d etc.). The more modules, the more license versions, coming with exponentially growing license compatibility issues, defeating the whole purpose of striving for a commons of digital goods. Actually, Creative Commons and commons advocates have struggled with even the base-line modularity of CC and tried to get the genie back into the bottle ever since. To some degree, more license modularity means more market and less commons. One of the best texts on the matter is ancient in Internet time, entitled \u201cWhat Contracts Cannot Do\u201d by Niva Elkin-Koren, reflecting on the inherent limits of license-based approaches to commons.  Some collective action problems seemingly demand collective solutions beyond freedom of (license) choice. Thanks for the \u201cWhat Contracts Cannot Do\u201d recommendation, I\u2019ll dive into that! \u201cI can do that. Can my dad? My neighbors? Is that their fault?\u201d This and your quote from 2013 is so applicable to various exoduses from social media in recent times, not because companies have closed, but because they became Unacceptably Bad or Evil, in the eyes of the public. I understand this to be a problem, but what\u2019s the solution? It\u2019s not anyone\u2019s fault they can\u2019t self-host or self-whatever, but what other solution is there for reliance on untrustworthy corporate interests? The \u201chacker\u201d identity will never be desirable for a majority of people, so how can hackers help people benefit from and access hacker resources despite this? I guess one method is solidarity: Not everyone becoming a hacker but people gathering together and building systems and infrastructures by the people for the people. Hackers have a role to play here just as non-hackers do. [\u2026] Who is Free Software for? [\u2026] I can\u2019t help noticing that the person known for popularizing the \u201cOpen Source\u201d side also pushed the idea of a \u201chacker culture\u201d pretty hard, and now wonder how influential that all was in making sure that (for example) people still hold a grudge against Canonical for daring to make Linux approachable to non-technical users. I also often wonder if underlying a lot of problems is the centralized nature of the movements.  For most purposes, everybody looks to two organizations for guidance, and both come off as unspeakably weird and myopic.  The FSF spent most of its history dismissing predictable enclosures (the web, appliances, firmware, patents, etc.) with some argument similar to \u201crms only cares about code running on his machine that he might want to change.\u201d  On the cultural side, Creative Commons still feels mired in its early worries about the RIAA suing people for downloading music on Napster, so the non-free licenses remain forever. Because of those choices, Wikipedia excepted, the general movement doesn\u2019t really care about building a \u201ccommons,\u201d let alone a commons that a person would actually care about, except for entrepreneurs exploiting it.  We have individuals doing our own things, but no communal efforts.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"ByNicolas Straut  ByNicolas Straut , Contributor.  CONY and MSTY differ in the stocks they\u2019re tied to and their associated performance and volatility, ... [+] as well as the ensuing returns and dividend yields each ETF delivers to investors. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer investors access to different strategies, sectors, and asset classes, whether they be passive index investing or more complicated options strategies like those offered by YieldMax ETFs. Two of YieldMax\u2019s popular ETFs, YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF (CONY) and YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (MSTY), provide investors exposure to options strategies tied to stocks in the cryptocurrency space, Coinbase (COIN) and Strategy (MSTR). This article will compare the holdings, performance, risk implications, and pros and cons of both CONY and MSTY, helping investors to determine if these ETFs are right for their portfolio. Investors should consider investing in YieldMax funds like CONY and MSTY if they\u2019d like the opportunity to earn more dividend yield through options-based strategies. Investors in YieldMax ETFs can earn regular income, risk-adjusted returns and exposure to an asset category like cryptocurrency or without direct stock or asset ownership. YieldMax ETFs can come with downsides like limited returns, market volatility and high expense ratios compared with direct stock ownership. These ETFs can also lead to higher tax burdens due to high dividend yields, so investors should research these funds and evaluate if the fund strategies are right for their investment strategy and financial situation. Below are the basics of both CONY and MSTY, similar income-focused focused ETFs offered by YieldMax which utilize options strategies to deliver attractive income generation and exposure to volatile stocks and sectors with capped gains. CONY is an income-focused ETF offered by YieldMax which utilizes a synthetic covered call or covered call spread strategy for Coinbase Global, Inc. (COIN). Through call options, CONY generates premium income which can lead to an attractive dividend yield for investors. This ETF is focused on income generation for investors as well as indirect exposure to the stock price of COIN while restricting potential stock gains in favor of yield. This ETF is ideal for income-focused investors but investors interested in growth should consider investing in COIN itself. MSTY is an income-focused ETF also offered by YieldMax which utilizes a synthetic covered call or covered call spread strategy for Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy). This ETF aims to deliver a high dividend yield while providing exposure to investors to Strategy with less volatility than direct stock ownership. Like CONY, MSTY offers higher income generation with restriction of capital appreciation. CONY has experienced a negative return of -15.52% over the past year, based on Coinbase\u2019s difficulties with regulators and industry volatility. In contrast, MSTY returned 62.68% while offering a lower dividend yield of 158% compared with CONY\u2019s 185% yield. MSTY\u2019s exposure to Strategy which is tied to Bitcoin which experienced strong performance in 2024 affected the ETF\u2019s performance. MSTY has shown strong momentum based on speculative trends for Bitcoin and Strategy in turn while CONY has lagged in returns like Coinbase. CONY holds option contracts based on Coinbase while MSTY holds options contracts based on Strategy performance. Both ETFs use synthetic cover call strategies but differ in their exposure to the two stocks. Investors should weigh the differences in performance of Coinbase and Strategy, historical ETF performance and yield, and market trends before investing in either CONY or MSTY. Investors should also consider other ETFs with differing strategies for their portfolios including the best ETFs of 2025, according to Forbes. Of late, CONY has delivered a higher dividend yield of 185% through income generated from call option premiums tied to Coinbase\u2019s stock. MSTY also delivered a strong dividend yield of 158% as well as an impressive 1-year return of 63% based on Strategy\u2019s price movements and connected Bitcoin volatility. Investors seeking income may prefer CONY based on historical dividend yield and MSTY for a mix of yield and growth, factoring in the inevitable volatility of both Strategy and Bitcoin. Market sentiment towards CONY has been cautious as Coinbase has experienced regulatory scrutiny (although the SEC recently dropped a lawsuit against them), as well as fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market. CONY experienced a negative 1-year return while delivering an impressive high dividend yield. Conversely, MSTY has experienced positive momentum with a high 1-year return, based on Strategy\u2019s Bitcoin speculation-driven high returns. If Bitcoin and Strategy in turn continue experiencing strong growth performance, MSTY may deliver an impressive dividend yield as well as strong returns for investors. Both CONY and MSTY bear risks tied to the exposure to the individual stocks the strategies are based on as well as underlying risks connected to the options strategies employed by YieldMax. CONY bears risks tied to Coinbase\u2019s volatility due to regulatory scrutiny as well as cryptocurrency exposure. MSTY also bears risk due to Strategy\u2019s exposure to Bitcoin and the speculative nature of the stock\u2019s trading multiple. CONY and MSTY also bear risk like capped gains and fluctuations in the derivative market. Investors tolerant to risk and motivated by performance should consider these best stocks for 2025, according to Forbes. CONY and MSTY both generate taxable income through options premiums which are typically treated as short-term capital gains. Before investing in either fund, investors should consult a tax expert to understand how distributions from the ETFs should affect their tax burdens. Investors should also evaluate the ideal account to hold these ETFs for their financial goals and tax situation like a taxable, traditional IRA or Roth IRA. CONY and MSTY are both attractive ETFs for income-motivated investors but each have pros and cons tied to stronger returns vs dividend yields, volatility, and sector exposure. CONY is well suited to investors focused more on stability and consistent yield payments, as well as investors who would like exposure to Coinbase without owning the stock directly. MSTY is more suitable for investors who want higher yield through options premiums as well as potential growth from MSTY\u2019s connection to bitcoin-linked volatility. As mentioned, CONY has experienced volatility as well due to Coinbase\u2019s regulatory issues connected to cryptocurrency offerings. Ultimately, investors should decide if an options fund strategy is right for them in the first place and also weigh their risk tolerance, prioritization of growth, individual tax situation and income needs before choosing one of these ETFs for their portfolio. Bottom Line CONY and MSTY offer income generation through option-based strategies tied to stocks in the cryptocurrency space. These ETFs differ in the stocks they\u2019re tied to and their associated performance and volatility, as well as the ensuing returns and dividend yields each ETF delivers to investors. CONY delivers a higher dividend yield and worse performance while MSTY delivers slightly lower income but greater returns tied to the strong performance of Bitcoin and Strategy. Understanding the underlying options strategies of both ETFs, the outlook for the associated stocks and how each ETF will operate in your portfolio and investment strategy will help you determine if CONY or MSTY is right for you.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"  \t\t\t\tTechdirt\t\t\t  This week, our first place winner on the insightful side is Rocky with a reply to an unhinged comment about the \u201cdebunked\u201d Steele Dossier \u201cfunded by Hillary Clinton\u201d: What\u2019s funny here is that you don\u2019t actually know the origin of said dossier or you have conveniently excised that knowledge from your brain, just like do with a lot of other knowledge that directly conflicts with any of your arguments de jour. It was originally commissioned by The Washington Free Beacon who didn\u2019t want a republican presidential candidate (Trump) with a lot of skeletons showing up during a campaign. So no, it wasn\u2019t funded by Hillary Clinton but I guess truth and facts is something you don\u2019t care about anymore since you find it easier to lie stupidly expecting everyone to believe you. This may shock you, but people are actually far smarter that you are so you can take your transparent lies and show them. In second place, it\u2019s That Anonymous Coward with a comment about Cybertruck owners asking Congress for protection against people making fun of them: Make people stop flipping me off when I drive around in my Deplorian! Make people stop putting mean notes on my Swasticar! Umm we have libraries getting bomb threats & get no extra help or protection\u2026 but someone flips you the bird and you need a SWAT team dispatched? I\u2019ve had people claiming I molest children & I haven\u2019t melted down this bad. They flipped you the bird, please fuck right off. For editor\u2019s choice on the insightful side, we start out with a comment from Drew about the collapse of American checks and balances: We had the same problem in the UK during the Johnson era. The people who came up with the controls never envisaged:a) a premier who would simply lie, lie, and lie again.b) a media system that would allow this to go (effectively) unchallenged.c) a party that would abandon its morals so abjectly.d) a court system that would go along for the ride (didn\u2019t happen in the UK but has plainly done so in the US).and finallye) an electorate that would vote for that candidate anyway, despite knowing all this. Next, it\u2019s Narcissus with predictions about Tesla stock: Not so sure \u201cAnd Tesla\u2019s stock will surely rise at some point.\u201d Tesla stock value was always based on air. The price of the stock would make it worth more than the 5 biggest carmakers together. If you want to be nasty, you could say that quintessentially it\u2019s a meme stock. From an investor standpoint you would defend those prices as a bet on the future of the company. Which is a big bet but, okay. However, now, due to Musk\u2019s antics, the brand (a huge part of a company\u2019s goodwill) is basically toxic. Besides that, sales are dropping like a stone and not even a Trump commercial can fix that. Seeing the reason for the drop it will make it worse probably. So, the future of the company is looking bleak. Any sane investor would look for the exit. Not sure that can be fixed. Maybe Musk can sell it to Greenpeace or the Dalai Lama? Over on the funny side, our first place winner is TheHangNail with a comment about Trump claiming that boycotting Tesla is illegal: Up is Down Wait, it was ok to boycott Bud Light because a trans person was shown drinking one for 30 seconds but boycotting a company because its CEO is systematically destroying our civic structure is not ok? Maybe we need to get as many trans people as possible to video themselves driving Teslas. It will, at the very least, confuse the heck out of the right. In second place, it\u2019s Krish with another comment about those touchy Cybertruck owners: Cyber Trucks don\u2019t have blinkers. They have virtue signals. For editor\u2019s choice on the funny side, since it bothers them so much, we\u2019ll continue with a few more Tesla-owner jokes.  First, bsbllshrtstp summing up their request for protections: DEI but for ugly trucks And finally, Bloof to close things out: \u2018I bought a grotesque status symbol to proudly show the libs exactly who I am, also please stop the libs judging me for who I am.\u2019 No wonder they were designed to look like an industrial freezer on wheels, given how they\u2019re filled with snowflakes. That\u2019s all for this week, folks!    I am reminded of a critical moment in my understanding of the situation around  2017-06-21, so close to this time during the first Trump administration. MAGAs, especially in news media were furious over a presentation of Julius Caesar for Shakespeare In The Park, Central Park, NYC because Gregg Henry was dressed like Trump (featuring the long red tie) and Calpurnia was a convincing Melania. Sponsoring companies were pressured to rescind their support, and they did. This came during the storm of snowflakery blaming, and I had collected a number of slow crystal images to attach whenever I was ranting on the internet and felt my leftist concerns were deeper than partisanship. (I thought it a clever joke at the time \u2744) I presumed that everyone was supposed to be hard and macho and able to receive criticism without the whinging, and I was prepared to be an iron liberal and steel-man every criticism I saw before reacting. But no, we discovered quickly around June 2017 that MAGAs and Trump himself were oh-so-tender about receiving criticism, whether name calling or deep-dive analysis and critique. They weren\u2019t here for it, and felt anyone in their movement should be privileged.  About the same time of the Shakespeare incident was the Cabinet Meeting of worship, in which all of Trump\u2019s cabinet went around the room telling Trump how super-amazing-wonderful-awesome he was, one of those moments that hearkened to old (early middle ages) fairy stories of fey mocking human social conventions by worming into a position of power and forcing everyone to humiliate themselves for the pleasure of the court. The message was clear MAGA is a higher strata, and deserves exceptional privilege. Everyone else are plebes essentially bigotry instilled into a single delineation. And this is why it\u2019s controversial to punch Nazis (MAGA, fascists, authoritarians, monarchists) rather than the usual convention that hitting someone is entirely inappropriate. All I wanna say is they don\u2019t really care about us. And so some people are going to react to disregard of their personhood with tit for tat. (It\u2019s too bad the Democratic party and mainstream media seems to \u2014 this time \u2014 be going full Neville Chamberlain. Once again, no war but class war. BTB explains Jewish media preferred their affluent brethren and failed to defend Jewish workers getting harassed, or criticize their attackers) Non-MAGAs aren\u2019t persons according to MAGAs. Keep this in mind whenever you are in their proxy. Non-MAGAs aren\u2019t persons according to MAGAs. Keep this in mind whenever you are in their proxy. As disgusting and vile as such a mindset it goes even farther than that, because as much as the cult loves to dehumanize and Other anyone not in the cult the vast majority of it\u2019s own members aren\u2019t persons according to the cult\u2019s leaders, as evidenced by the fact that they demonstrably do not care about the welfare or even lives of the people who vote for them and only care about getting their votes. A prime example is their nominal support for the military and veterans. They\u2019re happy to \u201cthank you for your service\u201d and wave flags and tell others to join up, but they\u2019ll march a million off to their deaths if it gets them what they want. They love the troops the way chess players love their pawns. \u201cConservatives want live babies so they can train them to be dead soldiers.\u201d Tesla?  easy kill, but he has huis other company to back him up.   AND I would watch his stocks bottom out, GRAB them fast.  Buy back and forth with a few friends to get the price up abit, THEN DUMP.. Cyber truck.  A truck that you have to hit a SAFTY switch to wash or you SHORT the battery compartment?  A TRUCK that has BASIC STREET TIRES, for best millage in town\/highway, But cant dig itself out of the Dirt\/snow.  And if you hit to many speed bumps, I WILL BET it will shatter the batteries. A truck with traction control??  Full 4 wheel power and 1 slip and it \u201cyour vehicle minimizes wheel spin by controlling brake pressure and motor power.\u201d Go look what VW is doing for the Bug, getting RID of the DASH computer that needs Multiple taps to do things.  GOING BACK to Buttons and switches, THEY LAST LONGER.. I\u2019m now considering using grok to try to fake a \u201ctesla model Xir\u201d ad campaign and try to go viral and really fuck the brand.

Wonder if that new expos\u00e8 book about Meta is going to energize congress to repeal section 230 further. What are you going to do if it does? Don\u2019t know, but I just learned Durbin\u2019s trying to repeal it via amendment instead on another bill: https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/amendment\/119th-congress\/senate-amendment\/1251\/text The comment\u2019s slow to show up, but Durbin tried to repeal section 230 via an amendment to a fentanyl-related bill. Looks like the amendment didn\u2019t make it into the bill though, but I guess now I have the thought of backdoor-attempts like this to keep me up at night. Say goodbye to all the friends I had online, I guess. Then you better get on making a list of those people you\u2019re going to say goodbye to. \u2026what, were you expecting me to attend your pity party? Miss me with that shit. Either prepare for the worst or don\u2019t, but don\u2019t fool yourself into believing your whining and your \u201cwoe is me\u201d act about things you can\u2019t control is anything but hubris and narcissism. The world won\u2019t stop turning because you want it to, so suck your shit up and get it together in a backpack. I\u2019m not expecting anything of you or any kind of pity-party, I\u2019m just droning on in a state of resignation here on the one site where I feel like it holds a tiny bit of relevance. I\u2019m just kind of meandering here while waiting to see if the sky falls down.    I\u2019m just droning on in a state of resignation here on the one site where I feel like it holds a tiny bit of relevance.  No, you\u2019re throwing a pity party and hoping someone will attend. Stop it. Worry less about things you have little-to-no hope of changing on your own and worry more about things you can actually control. But if being on Techdirt is causing you to make these kinds of post, there\u2019s a simple solution to that: Leave and don\u2019t come back. You\u2019ll be better off not making yourself feel like shit and the rest of us will be better off not having to deal with your shit all the time. This comment has been flagged by the community. Click here to show it. It\u2019s clear that MAGA operates on a hierarchy where criticism is intolerable, and privilege is expected. The double standard has been obvious since incidents like the Shakespeare controversy and the cabinet\u2019s public praise session. Non-MAGAs are treated as lesser, which fuels the cycle of resistance. Whether it\u2019s media bias or political inaction, the lesson remains: class struggle is the real fight. By the way, if you\u2019re looking for a working hours calculator, it\u2019s a useful tool to track time efficiently\u2014something those in power rarely seem to respect when it comes to the working class. https:\/\/calculettemauricettepro.fr\/ It\u2019s far from \u201cinsightful\u201d to claim the Washington Free Beacon \u201ccommissioned\u201d the Steele Dossier. The WFB\u2019s involvement with Fusion GPS was terminated in May 2016. Orbis\/Steele came on in June, after the Clinton campaign (via Perkins Cole) hired Fusion GPS. See: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Steele_dossier#History I tried making that exact point last week. What\u2019s the betting anyone will listen to you any more than they listened to me (not at all)? You are booth missing something important here. As I said, it all originally started with The Washington Free Beacon funding the research. As you both correctly point out there Trying again after managing to make an incomplete post You are booth missing something important here. As I said, it all originally started with The Washington Free Beacon funding the research, and then the DNC started paying for more information which you both correctly point out. The important bit here is that the second phase of the investigation wasn\u2019t directly funded by the DNC, Fusion GPS sold it\u2019s services to the DNC through Perkins Coie. Ie they were selling a service through a middleman, it\u2019s why if you look at what happens in the timeline it specifically says that the DNC \u201cindirectly funded the dossier\u201d \u2013 just like how someone is indirectly funding some manufacturer somewhere when a salesman convinces them to buy something. Could I have been more clear in what I said earlier? Sure, but the point is that the sentence \u201cHillary Clinton funded the Steele dossier\u201d isn\u2019t the truth but a distortion and conflation of what actually happened because that way it is easier to link any kind of supposed wrongdoings by Steele directly to the DNC and Hillary Clinton even though they had no clue who Steel was before the dossier became public knowledge. TL;DR: Every time someone says \u201cHillary Clinton funded the Steele dossier\u201d they are saying something that isn\u2019t true because the actual truth means they have no argument at all to begin with. There are two reasons why people are using that phrase, one reason is they know that its an easy way to tie Steele directly to the DNC\/Hillary Clinton, the second reason is because they don\u2019t know any better and are just repeating something that was intentionally coined for the former reason and thus stops them from thinking any further about what actually happened, ie it is a meme-like sound-byte that makes people forget the actual facts.

The Hollyland Lark M2 was already a small, high-quality wireless microphone you could get for the iPhone, but now its M2S successor is even more tiny. A Federal Civil Court judge ruled that Apple will not be required to enable sideloading in Brazil, meaning that the iPhone maker can continue to distribute apps exclusively via the App Store. Plex has announced that it will no longer offer free remote streaming for personal media and says its subscription options will see a significant price increase effective April 29, 2025. While much has been written throughout the years about Apple's cellular modem and how it would stack up versus Qualcomm, Apple's C1 modem in the iPhone 16e is no slouch when it comes to actual internet speeds. Maybe Apple will never fully walk away from Europe, but the European Commission has just guaranteed that the citizens of its member states will always be the last to get new iPhone features \u2014 if they get them at all. A recent survey found Apple's new iPhone 16e isn't impressing existing iPhone users, but it misses the point on the smartphone's intended consumer base. A newly leaked image of what's claimed to be a case for the forthcoming iPhone 17 Air, matches recent descriptions of a new design for the camera bump. Apple's power consumption concerns has reportedly led to the development of new chips to control the display of the iPhone Fold, with it apparently now using a smaller chip fabrication process. Jeff Pu has shared a report repeating several rumors, including Ming-Chi Kuo's earlier report suggesting all iPhone 17 models would get Apple's custom Wi-Fi chips. ","label":0}

With Nvidia setting limits that 3rd party OEMs aren't allowed to surpass, the GPU has been fixed and there is not enough competition on the high end. AMD is looking viable now at least for enthusiast gamers. With x86 licenses being short, the APU market does not have enough competition either. There will never be RAM slots or sockets on a GPU. It's impossible from a signal integrity standpoint. At least AMD has an APU that can share most of its possible 128GB with the CPU part.

It would take a huge number of circuit traces to do that with replaceable memoryStrix Halo will not have replaceable memory.meaning a lot of power loss and board space and probably lower clock rates because of the additional distance.Power loss isn't really a general problem, it's a problem that specific to LPDDR. You can have lots of bandwidth with replaceable memory too, but these days, we're using LPDDR which makes replaceable memory difficult at higher speeds due to the low voltage.

Hmm, well Ray Tracing or Path Tracing (a simplified form of Ray Tracing that uses the most likely path to each light) need access to the entire scene and that takes more memory. Traditional rasterization culls the scene using the view frustum, backface culling, etc., so you end up with a much smaller dataset that needs to get processed, but you need those back faces and objects outside the scene to properly calculate reflections in ray algorithms.

Anyone can design a better item, but the claim means nothing if it is that much more expensive as well.

Certainly not $20000, but it would be pricey. this is only in \"simulation\" so the proof and the TDP numbers will be in the tape-out prototypes.. Even 10% slower would put them in the running if there is a lower initial capital investment for someone putting together a data center. I don't see a need to exaggerate if your fundamentals are in order. If an established company announce a graphics card that is 10x faster, that's news.Not really. Read the story. It's 10x faster in a very specific scenario. That happens frequently enough. This is not going to replace the GPU in your gaming rig.

While the claims are pretty wild, at least they're not claiming they're better at everything. And specifically FP64, which is not something the 5090 is especially good at: NVidia claim only a few percent of the FP32 performance, actually somewhat less than a high end threadripper.

Right now, I'm a little behind schedule on delivery to market due to some manufacturing delays due to capital issues. If you're an investor, this is your chance to git in on the ground floor of what is certain to be the market and industry disruptor of the century. Don't miss out on this once in a lifetime opportunity. Send me your life saving via BitCoin or Ethereum TODAY! Can't go tits up! Yesterday's news. I recently published a slide that says MY upcoming GPU will be 10,000 times faster than Nvidia - and draw only 3.5 watts! The thing with RISC-V is that its vector extension had been designed from the start to be useful as a foundation to design a GPU around. Then there are many ways to do the actual microarchitecture, of course, and any RVV implementation is not necessarily particularly GPU-like. I don't want to see just open source hardware, I would like to see open source GPU frameworks based around RVV -- and GPU designers embracing such an open source system. More portability between vendors could lead to more competition. This is a contrived comparison.  All GeForce cards have terrible FP64 performance.  It's rarely used in gaming and they don't bother trying to make it fast.  Data center cards like H100 and B200 have much better FP64 performance.  They're designed for compute applications where its more important. So they compared their own GPU designed for compute against an NVIDIA GPU designed for gaming, and found theirs is better at compute.  I'm shocked, shocked to hear that!  If they're going to test against a GPU designed for gaming, they need to test on gaming benchmarks.  If they're going to test on compute benchmarks, they need to compare to a GPU designed for compute.  I've also found that AMD GPUs have much better FP64 performance than comparable Nvidias (using my own OpenCL code, so not a general benchmark). It's just another instance of Nvidia's optimizations  [slashdot.org] in their gaming cards.   As for the better FP64 of data center cards, it's interesting that AI uses very low precision such as 4 or 8 bits. So I wouldn't be surprised to see AI-optimized GPUs that lose the higher precision parts.   Finally, if you can make a chip with a ton of RISC-V cores, why not make a massively That was true up through Radeon VII.  For any consumer AMD card beyond that, it's no longer true.  And Radeon VII was released in 2019. \"Bolt's additional proprietary extensions designed for acceleration of scientific workloads\" When GPGPU in supercomputers was an up and coming thing 20 years ago, the big roadblock to acceptance by the big government funding agencies was the need to rewrite software.

Often the time to redevelop the software swamps the actual runtime (e.g., it may take 1-2 years to optimize a complex program to get it to run a few days faster), which wipes out the benefit of the new hardware.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"Business Insider Edition  It's been 25 years since the dot-com crash, and investors are again navigating concerns of a tech bubble reaching unsustainable levels.          The Nasdaq Composite peaked on March 10, 2000 and the subsequent unwind would last nearly three years, taking the tech-heavy index down 78% at its low in October 2002.               Fast-forward 25 years and investors are wondering whether the advent of artificial intelligence has catapulted markets back into bubble territory.           With the Nasdaq down 13% in the last month, the recent stock sell-off has some investors wondering if this is the beginning of a much longer and more painful correction after years of bullish exuberance. Sound familiar?               Here's what investors and strategists told Business Insider about some of the hard-learned lessons from the dot-com crash.               Whether you're looking at the Dutch tulip bubble of the 1630s or the Japanese real estate bubble of the 1980s, all market cycles undergo the same phases that investors should be aware of.               Ted Mortonson, managing director and technology specialist at Baird, told BI those distinct phases include overexuberance, complacency, concern\/fear, panic, and capitulation.               \"Until each phase of the cycle is experienced, bottoms cannot occur,\" Mortonson said.               Mortonson estimates that the current market cycle is in the concern\/fear zone, suggesting that there is more downside ahead.               \"We will sell off materially in early April on growth deceleration fears,\" Mortonson said, adding that first-quarter earnings results will be riddled with misses and lowered guidance amid ongoing uncertainty around President Donald Trump's trade policies.               According to Giuseppe Sette, president at Reflexivity, stock valuations should be closely monitored by investors.               The forward price-to-earnings ratio of the Samp;P 500 peaked at about 24x in 2000. It recently approached those levels but quickly retreated, topping out at about 23x in 2021 and then again earlier this year.               \"The dot-com bubble and 2021 together show that 23x-24x forward P\/E is as much as the market is able to sustain,\" Sette told BI via email. \"Every time you see 22.5x P\/E, a drawdown is near.\"               While the current stock market isn't riddled with profitless companies like it was in 2000, it does have its fair share of firms trading at extreme valuations \u2014 but it also has significant profits to back up those valuations.               A good example is Nvidia, the poster child of the AI boom. The chip titan has grown its net income by 788% since 2023 and is trading at a slight discount to the S&P 500 despite it being on track to grow its revenue by 75% this year.               While stock market valuations can get out of hand, it's usually for a good reason.               The internet's promise proved to be real, and the same will probably be true for artificial intelligence, according to Sette.               \"The dot-com bubble was 'right' about the promise of tech, only the bubble came 10-15 years too early. Now the tech is actually here,\" Sette said. \"In a matter of 1.5 years, we had an explosion of AI capabilities, and their progress is only accelerating. Where will AI be in 5 years? How far from AGI? Maybe this time is really different.\"               So many dot-com era firms that cashed in on the promise of the World Wide Web ended up going bust, but consider that the big winners of that time \u2014 companies like Amazon and eBay \u2014 not only survived but are thriving a quarter century later.               According to Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO and the only Wall Street strategist who has consistently published research since the dot-com bubble, the stock market is nowhere close to being in a bubble.               \"Just because asset prices go up doesn't mean it's a bubble,\" Belski told Business Insider.               \"It's early innings. In 1999\/2000, we were doing crazy stuff. Like companies were buying other companies with stock, like bad stock.\"               That sort of behavior isn't happening right now despite the AI boom.               The IPO market has been dormant for years and has shown few signs of thawing, another sign the bubble hasn't yet been inflated.               \"In a bubble, everybody makes money,\" Belski said.               \"Why AI is not a bubble right now? You have to take two steps back and think about this. Are the investment banks making money on this? Are we seeing massive primary or secondary offerings? Are we seeing massive consolidation in M&A activity?\"               Belski thinks the word \"bubble\" is thrown around too often on Wall Street, and it's had a negative impact on investors' psyche for years.               \"The market has been humbled for much of the last 30 years, and every single time the market goes up, investors say 'Oh it's gonna go down! It's gonna go down.' That's massively different than the late 1990s,\" Belski said.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"In a nutshell: As Intel prepares for the arrival of its new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, a recent regulatory filing has revealed details of his comprehensive compensation package. Tan will receive a base salary of $1 million, with the potential to earn an annual bonus of up to $2 million. However, the bulk of his compensation comes from long-term equity awards and stock options, totaling approximately $66 million.  The package includes a long-term equity grant valued at $14.4 million and a performance grant of $17 million in Intel shares, set to vest over five years. Notably, Tan will only receive these shares if Intel's stock price does not decline over the next three years, with the potential to earn additional shares if the company outperforms the market. In addition, Tan will receive stock options worth $9.6 million and a new-hire option grant valued at $25 million. This comprehensive package is designed to align his incentives with long-term shareholder value creation. Intel emphasized that Tan's compensation is competitive within the industry and reflects his extensive experience as a technology leader.  Given the broader industry trend of linking executive compensation to performance and equity growth, Tan's package is substantial but not unusual compared to other tech CEOs. Many top executives in the sector receive the bulk of their compensation through stock options and grants, often contingent on meeting specific performance benchmarks. To qualify for the grants and bonuses, Tan agreed to purchase $25 million in Intel shares within his first month as CEO. Additionally, the compensation package includes provisions for accelerated vesting in the event of a change in control, as outlined in Intel's recent SEC filing. As Tan takes the helm, Intel is counting on his deep industry expertise to drive a turnaround and sustain the recent momentum in its stock price, which has risen nearly 20 percent in 2025. In a statement, he reaffirmed Intel's commitment to reclaiming its status as a premier foundry, underscoring the company's dedication to the sector despite growing competition from TSMC and Samsung.  Tan previously served as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, a leading electronic systems design company, from 2009 to 2021, and was a board member from 2004 to 2023. Having stepped down last August, he will now also rejoin Intel's board of directors.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"Business Insider Edition  Big Tech companies are eyeing small modular reactors as an AI energy solution \u2014 even as some remain unsure about its potential.          There's no official standard that defines a small modular reactor, or SMR, according to two leading nuclear experts who spoke with Business Insider. The industry consensus is that they produce less power \u2014 around 300 megawatts instead of the 1,000 megawatts, or 1 gigawatt \u2014 than a traditional reactor.               The SMR playing field is also relatively small.               Data compiled from CB Insights and Pitchbook showed that over the past eight years, only four companies received about 92% of the nearly $3.2 billion in equity funding that went to SMR-focused firms.               Those companies include X-energy, Bill Gates' Terrapower, NuScale, and the Paris-based Newcleo.               \"It's new, and it's old at the same time,\" Allison MacFarlane, former US Nuclear Regulatory Commission chairman, said of SMRs in an interviewwith Business Insider. MacFarlane was referring to how many SMR designs have yet to be demonstrated in real life, but the technology the reactor is based on has been around for many decades.               Tech companies like Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft are investing in the technology with the hope of finding a sustainable and reliable energy source to meet the increasing power demands of artificial intelligence and data centers.               In a March report, the Center for Strategic & International Studies estimated that new\u00a0energy demands for all US data centerswill reach 40 to 90 gigawatts by 2030. That's equivalent to simultaneously powering four to nine New York Cities during peak demands in the middle of the summer.               The CSIS number is just one estimate, however: The uncertainty around how much energy AI and data centers will require in a short time is one reason nuclear experts who spoke with BI say it's unclear if SMRs will be a key player in the solution.               \"It'll depend on the size of the data centers,\" Jacopo Buongiorno, director of MIT's Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Systems, said in an interview. \"The hyperscalers \u2014 I understand that the latest (centers) that are proposed is close to a gigawatt, in which case it probably makes more sense to have a large reactor.\"               There are no SMRs up and running in the United States. According to the Nuclear Energy Agency, three are in China, Russia, and Japan.               The earliest \u2014 and most optimistic \u2014 timelines to get an SMR online in the US will likely be around 2030, with TerraPower's Natrium SMR currently under construction in Wyoming and X-energy's Xe-100 on the Texas Gulf Coast.               Here's a quick look at the four SMR companies that have received the most equity funding as of 2025. Dollar figures exclude funding from public-private partnerships.               Founded in 2009 by Kam Ghaffarian, an Iranian businessman who also co-founded Axiom Space, X-energy is designing a high-temperature gas-cooled SMR, or HTGR,\" called the Xe-100 \u2014 different from the light-water reactors operating in the US.               The Xe-100 is what's known as a \"pebble bed model,\" which extracts electricity by tightly packingtogetherthousands of \"pebbles\" the size of billiard balls coated with uranium fuel particles, according to the Department of Energy.               The model has been demonstrated abroad, according to McFarlane.               \"Germany had one, and China has one right now that's operating,\" MacFarlane said. \"What the Germans found with theirs is that these pebbles \u2014 these sort of grapefruit-sized fuel elements, if you will \u2014 created a huge amount of dust which made a really big radioactive mess.\"               Robert McEntyre, a spokesperson for X-Energy, told BI in a statement that \"Xe-100 meets the highest safety and operational standards, backed by over 50 years of HTGR development,\" adding that technical experts at the company say the assertion that the German SMR's dust issues created a radioactive mess is \"inaccurate.\"               X-Energy announced a partnership with Dow in 2022 to install the Xe-100 at one of the chemical production company's Gulf Coast sites and have it online by 2030.               \"It's a big chemical plant that uses a lot of electricity and a lot of heat,\" Buongiorno said of the Gulf Coast site. \"And at the moment, it gets both from burning natural gas.\"               X-energy also announced a $500 million Series C-1 funding round anchored by Amazon in 2024. The two companies plan to bring SMRs generating a total of 5 gigawatts of energy online in the US by 2039.               \"Our proven technology offers one of the most cost-effective and safest ways to bring net-new clean energy to market,\" McEntyre said. \"Amazon and Dow are not just off-takers but strategic partners in our effort to be a first-mover on advanced nuclear.\"               TerraPower was co-founded byGates,a vocal proponent of nuclear energy, in 2008.               The company is building a sodium-cooled fast reactor \u2014 using liquid metal rather than water as a coolant \u2014 in Wyoming. Terrapower calls it the Natrium reactor and plans to get in online by 2030.               Buongiorno calls the estimated arrival date a bit optimistic by a couple of years or so for two reasons.               One, the supply chain for the enriched uranium \u2014 the fuel that will power the reactor \u2014 is still being established in the US, he said.               \"At the moment, there is no supply chain in the US,\" Buongiorno said. \"There is in Russia, there is in China, but for obvious reasons, we can't do business with either one.\"               The second reason is that Natrium will be the first reactor Terrapower ever built.               \"They are bound to have challenges they haven't thought about,\" he said, pointing to potential hiccups with the supply chain and licensing processes or other regulatory hurdles.               A TerraPower spokesperson said in a statement to BI that the company has \"rapidly established a reliable supply chain, recently securing contracts for all long-lead components needed for construction, and today announced an agreement to establish a manufacturing supply chain to assist in the development of multiple reactors.\"               \"We are actively constructing the non-nuclear portions of the Natrium commercial demonstration plant in Kemmerer, Wyoming,\" the spokesperson said. \"Furthermore, the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission recently announced that our safety evaluation is ahead of schedule.\"               In January, the company announced a deal with Sabey Data Centers to explore deployment opportunities for its Natrium reactors in the Rocky Mountain region and Texas.       Newcleo is a new player in the reactor field that launched in 2021 and is based in Paris. It was founded by Italian physicist Stefano Buono, an alum of the European Organization for Nuclear Research.               The company specializes in lead-cooled fast reactors, which use liquid or molten lead as a coolant.               \"It's a design that was actually demonstrated by the Russians on some of their submarines back in the '70s,\" Buongiorno told BI. \"So nothing is entirely new here, my friend.\"               Newcleo said in February that it started the land acquisition process to build its first lead-cooled fast reactor in France by 2031. It will serve as a demonstrator reactor, showcasing the viability of the SMR design, according to a company press release.               A Newcleo spokesperson told BI that the company \"benefits from strong public recognition and support both in France and across Europe and is one of only two Advanced Modular Reactor projects selected by the European Industrial Alliance on Small Modular Reactors.\"               NuScale was founded in Corvallis, Oregon, in 2007 by Jos Reyes, a fellow of the American Nuclear Society, and Paul Lorenzini, former CEO of Powercor Australia electric provider. The company went public in 2022.               NuScale's SMR designs are based on the more common light-water reactor.               \"I'm kind of simplifying, but it is essentially a smaller version of large pressurized water reactors, which are the backbone of the nuclear industry as we have known it for decades,\" Buongiorno said.               NuScale CEO John L. Hopkins said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on March 3 that light-water SMRs give NuScale an edge over others in the SMR space because they're \"not burdened by the additional hurdles faced by non-light water reactor SMR technologies.\"               But NuScale has not been without challenges.               Although the company has agreements to develop SMRs in Ghana, Romania, and Poland, NuScale has yet to ink a deal to develop one of its reactors in the US.               Plans to build six of NuScale's 77-megawatt reactors in Idaho were terminated in 2023 because the project failed to attract enough customers to support soaring costs stemming from inflation, Hopkins said during an earnings call in November 2023.               The company said in an earnings presentation that NuScale has seen increased interest across the board.               \"In an era where more energy is necessary to fortify the US electricity grid, power economic growth, and bolster America's global competitiveness, the need for new nuclear is becoming a reality,\" Hopkins said during the fourth-quarter earnings call.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"by Jayne Elliott Reddit\/Shutterstock Investing in the stock market means that you could end up making a lot of money, but there\u2019s also risk involved. You could also lose a lot of money. In today\u2019s story, one man is very upset that a customer service representative didn\u2019t do as he had instructed with his retirement accounts. When the call is escalated to a manager, the manager complies with the customer\u2019s request, but it doesn\u2019t work out well for the customer. Let\u2019s see what happens. Some of you might recall that financial crisis that happened a bit back, circa 2008-ish. At the time, I was working in a call center for retirement accounts such as 401k\u2019s or 403b\u2019s. For any non-Americans, these are plans from your employer where you can contribute a portion of your salary, and usually they will also contribute something as well, to save for retirement. This is probably the biggest way that Americans save for the end. As the account-holder, you have control over how the money is invested. Usually from a small selection of different mutual funds. Sometimes when you ask to talk to a manager you don\u2019t actually get a manager. Also, about the call center\u2026 I had some experience, I knew what I was talking about and was able to speak with confidence in my voice. Therefor, I was on the \u201cescalated\u201d line. This is reserved for the people who \u201cwant to talk to a manager.\u201d I was not a manager, but I and others like me got these calls. This is how the job usually worked. In some rare cases, we actually fixed a problem, but more often than not, just told the customer the same thing they had just heard from the first rep, only with that level of confidence. Then they hung up as a happy customer. We also had the ability to review previous calls to the center. One customer was really upset. So, one day in April of 2009, an irate client was transferred to me. He had just gotten his quarterly financial statement, showing that he was invested in several different funds that were affected by the stock market. His complaint was that he had called a month earlier to request that his stock-market based investments be moved to something more stable and less risky (at that time, the news was all doom-and-gloom, leading people to make majorly ill-informed financial decisions). This didn\u2019t happen. The man kept interrupting him. As I reviewed the transaction history on his account, I confirmed that whoever he had spoken to previously had only redirected new contributions into stable funds, but had made no change to any existing balance. I told the gentleman that I could review the call, and if our rep had made a mistake, adhere to his wishes. I then tried to say something else\u2026 but was quickly cut-off. \u201cYes, review that call. I want my money out of the market!!!\u201d I try to say something like \u201cokay, but sir\u2026.\u201d only to be cut-off again. The rep actually had made a mistake. This was not a man with a small account balance, at the time it was 500k+, meaning that at the beginning of the crisis, he probably had around 1 mil in his account. I reviewed the call. And yes, our rep had made a mistake. I went through the process to retroactively conduct his requested transactions. The rep got a negative mark on his record for making a mistake, but the customer really got the short end. He wanted to explain the situation to the man on the phone. For those that don\u2019t know, the low-point in the market was in early March of that year. Many stocks and markets rebounded enormously and very quickly. What I wanted to tell the guy was something like \u201cfund A is up 28% since the day you made that call. Fund B is up 32%\u2026. \u201d and so on. But, as he didn\u2019t give me the chance to tell him to think about his request\u2026 well, that is why I am posting here. The man would\u2019ve been better off if he hadn\u2019t called. As my company had to backdate his transactions, he instantly lost about 150K in his account, and missed out on the boom. Of course, he called later to complain. But, even after our mistake, we had done exactly as he had asked. I hope he is enjoying his retirement. I bet that customer was really upset when he found out how much money he lost. Let\u2019s see how Reddit reacted to this story. Sometimes it\u2019s better not to touch your accounts.  This person\u2019s friends made some very bad decisions.  People with experience are worth listening to.  This guy did everything wrong.  This person had a lucky break!  If he had been nice, the customer service rep could\u2019ve helped him. That\u2019s what you\u2019re paying him for, after all. If you liked that post, check out this post about a woman who tracked down a contractor who tried to vanish without a trace.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us? The iPhone 17 Air is going to be the next big smartphone experiment at Apple. With a rumored thickness of just 5.5 millimeters and a high-density battery, it\u2019s going to be the showcase of multiple innovations later this year. But Apple\u2019s plans for slimmer phones down the road sound even more ambitious. According to Bloomberg, Apple is planning to make a phone so slim that it will lack any physical port whatsoever. In fact, the company explored the idea for the iPhone 17 Air, but decided to wait out on those plans for a variety of reasons. \u201cAn even bigger idea was to make the Air device Apple\u2019s first completely port-free iPhone, one that omits that charging inlet as well as physical SIM tray. That would mean losing the USB-C connector and going all-in on wireless charging and syncing data with the cloud,\u201d says the report. One of the reasons Apple killed the port-less design idea for the iPhone 17 Air was regulatory headache, especially in the EU bloc. Apple was the last major brand to offer a proprietary port on its smartphones, before finally switching to a USB-C interface on the iPhone 15 series. The absence of a port would mean the iPhone 17 Air had to rely solely on the MagSafe wireless charging system. Moreover, the data storage duties would be tightly integrated with the iCloud system, since there is no hardware route for extracting or transferring data via cable. It would have been a cumbersome move for an average buyer, especially from a repairability perspective. However, Apple is apparently serious about the whole idea. As per the Bloomberg report, if the iPhone 17 Air proves to be a success, Apple might again explore the idea of creating a port-free smartphone. Apple won\u2019t be the first to attempt that moonshot. Back in 2019, Chinese smartphone giant Vivo showcased the Apex concept. It was a device that lacked a USB port, SIM tray, buttons, or even speakers. In fact, the entire screen doubled as one massive fingerprint sensor on this one. The same year, fellow Chinese brand Meizu revealed the Zero concept. It was a high-end phone idea without a charging port or a headphone jack. The company put the phone up for crowdfunding but failed to hit its financial backing goal. Meizu later confirmed that the Zero was never intended as a mass-market device. But it seems 2025 will see a return to truly minimalist smartphone designs. The likes of Samsung, Honor, and Oppo are reportedly working on their own ultra-slim phones. Tecno also wowed the crowd at MWC 2025 with a working sample of the Spark Slim smartphone. Xiaomi is also reportedly working on a phone that will lack any physical button whatsoever, but so far, the brand has remained mum on any such plans. Oppo's compact flagship phone is close to launching, is confirmed to be called the Oppo Find X8s. The company has been teasing its advancements over the competition fervently and recently threw light on the phone's display upgrades over other phones, including one way it beats the iPhone 16 Pro. The Oppo Find X8s is claimed to feature extremely thin bezels along all four sides of its display. Zhou Yibao, the product manager for Oppo's flagship Find series, shared an image on Chinese social media Weibo comparing the bezels on the upcoming compact phone -- previously speculated to be called the Find X8 Mini -- with those on what appears to be an iPhone 16 Pro or the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Apple Wallet has seen several improvements recently, but the most recent update changes Subscriptions & Payments to Preauthorized Payments. This naming scheme is more straightforward and clear about what it does, and it also gives you an idea of any upcoming payments. This feature is only present in the most recent version of the iOS 18.4 beta, though. If you go looking for it on your own device (and you aren't participating in the beta), you won't be able to find it.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"  In the '80s and '90s, Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger were engaged in an ongoing battle to become the number one action star in America. On the one hand you had Stallone, who, after catapulting himself to stardom with 1976's \"Rocky,\" maintained his standing as an A-lister by becoming the archetypal action hero in the \"Rambo\" saga. That franchise began in 1982 with a somewhat grounded character study of a Vietnam vet haunted by his experiences overseas before transmogrifying into the epitome of the '80s macho-fests we now associate with the decade. Meanwhile, despite thinking James Cameron's \"Terminator\" script had no potential, Schwarzenegger agreed to star in the 1984 low-budget sci-fi slasher, immediately becoming a star as a result. He then fronted some of the most beloved action movies of the '80s and '90s, and all the while he and Sly were taking some pretty overt jabs at one another. As Schwarzenegger put it during a Fantastic Fest Q&A, \"It was a competition of who had the biggest gun, and then who uses the biggest knife. [...] Who has the most unique killings? Who kills more people on screen? Who makes more money at the box office?\" The rivalry was much more than a friendly feud, too, with each actor trying to derail the other's career for years. One of the greatest moments in this ongoing battle was when Schwarzenegger tricked Stallone into starring in the flop that was 1992's \"Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot.\" A year after the Austrian Oak had starred in one of the greatest action movies ever made with \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day,\" his rival was fronting a limp action comedy that became a box office disaster. At the time, the idea of a film starring these two juggernauts of action cinema was laughable at best. Which is why it was kind of a big deal to see the pair fronting a prison break action thriller in 2013. At least, it would have been a big deal had the Hollywood veterans still been at the height of their careers. As it transpired, 2013's \"Escape Plan\" sort of came and went without much fanfare. As such, the anticlimactic team-up remains somewhat of a curio in the stars' long shared history, especially since it spawned two direct-to-video follow-ups that were even worse than the original.   By the 2000s, both Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger had reached simultaneous nadirs in their careers. Arnie was trying to recapture his glory years with 2000's lackluster sci-fi flop \"The 6th Day\" (at least he was paid $25 million for the effort)\u00a0and Sly was as close to washed up as he'd ever been, struggling to get any studio to back his Rocky comeback movie (which would eventually happen in 2006 as \"Rocky Balboa,\" the film that saved the \"Rocky\" franchise). This is where things got really interesting, because after \"Rocky Balboa,\" Stallone found himself with some newfound prestige, which he parlayed into the \"Expendables\" films \u2014 a series that paid loving homage to the over-the-top action-fests to which Stallone and his longtime rival were so integral. By this point, the pair had seemingly patched things up, with Arnie appearing in all three movies in the franchise. Then, what had been unthinkable during the height of the pair's rivalry suddenly became a reality with \"Escape Plan,\" a 2013 prison break action thriller that saw Stallone and Schwarzenegger co-starring. While the duo had technically co-starred in two \"Expendables\" movies, those projects featured the two actors as parts of a larger ensemble. \"Escape Plan,\" however, was a true Stallone\/Schwarzenegger team-up. The film saw Sly play Ray Breslin, a security analyst who has an unorthodox approach to his work in that he places himself inside high-security prisons and tries to break out in order to pinpoint their security weaknesses. After he winds up actually incarcerated in the world's most secure prison, known only as \"The Tomb,\" he has to use his professional skills to actually break himself out of confinement. He then befriends fellow inmate, Emil Rottmayer (Schwarzenegger), who's more than happy to help Breslin on his mission. Directed by Swedish filmmaker Mikael H\u00e5fstr\u00f6m, \"Escape Plan\" only just avoided being a complete flop thanks to the international box office, which propelled the movie to a $103 million global take. Critics were, at best, lukewarm on the project, however, which currently bears a devastatingly average 50% score on Rotten Tomatoes. You'd think that with some dodgy box office numbers and a less than impressive critical response, Stallone and Schwarzenegger would leave it there. Well, the latter did. The former? Well, he drove this thing into the ground.   If \"Escape Plan,\" which featured the might of screen legend Arnold Schwarzenegger, was Sylvester Stallone's plan A, so to speak, then 2018's \"Escape Plan 2: Hades\" felt very much like a plan B. That is to say that if the first movie featuring Sly's former rival didn't lend the project some historic movie star team-up heft, then the ever-persistent Stallone would probably have made \"Escape Plan 2,\" which instead of Arnie co-starred Dave Bautista and 50 Cent. Clearly distributor Lionsgate knew that 2013's \"Escape Plan\" did not make enough to warrant another theatrical release in the United States, so the sequel \"Hades\" went direct-to-video here and got a small release internationally. As you might expect, the film wasn't good. In fact, it's one of Stallone's lowest-rated movies on Rotten Tomatoes, and he's got some stinkers on there (this is the man who brought us \"Judge Dredd,\" the stupidest science fiction movie to predict our terrifying present). A lowly 7% RT score is surely not what Sly was hoping for, and despite Bautista charting a much more impressive course in the years since, he couldn't do much to rescue this follow-up from itself. Not that it matters when you've got critics calling a film \"utterly nonsensical and incomprehensible,\" but the sequel saw Ray Breslin and his team of security specialists rescue their associate, Shu Ren (Huang Xiaoming), from a supposedly inescapable prison. Such a narrative not only made for some truly rotten reviews, it resulted in a $16.6 million box office take from a limited international theatrical run, and a reported $4.2 million take in the domestic home market \u2014 just about enough to make back its budget of $20 million. Surely, then, this was the movie to break Stallone out of his own prison of churning out abject DTV actioners? Nope. There's a third movie: \"Escape Plan: The Extractors.\" It might surprise you to learn that this one actually fared better critically than \"Hades.\" Still, \"The Extractors\" tried its best to be a worse movie than its predecessor, with NPR's Tim Cogshell dubbing the film \"terrible\" and surmising that its sole reason for existence was \"the Hong Kong [movie] market.\" That might provide some insight into why Sly and Dave Bautista would agree to these films. After the first one was carried by its international box office, it seems Lionsgate and the stars were eager to try to appeal to that market going forward. Nobody in U.S. theaters would see it, and that was probably for the best. Meanwhile, global audiences very much would see the movie and provide Sly and co. with a decent enough payday. If you do fancy taking a trip through Sly's prison break thriller trilogy, \/Film has already broken down the correct order to watch the \"Escape Plan\" movies.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"Business Insider Edition  When Em graduated from the Pratt Institute in May 2020, two months into the pandemic, there were simply no jobs for a sculpture major, even in New York. \"That absolutely set the tone for the rest of my attempt at a career,\" Em, now 26, says.          So they took an intensive nine-month coding boot camp and started applying for tech jobs. After they got rejected from about 10 roles, the entire tech industry was besieged by mass layoffs in 2022, leaving Em even more dispirited. \"It was just another pathway to shit,\" they recall thinking. Eventually, they found work as an office manager at a nonprofit for a while and quickly lost their coding skills. Last year, Em applied to more than 400 jobs across the communications, administrative, and service industries \u2014 and was rejected by every one.               \"I am miserable, and it is breaking my body down,\" Em tells me over the phone from California, where they've been living at a relative's house scraping by on $700 a month from contract work. They add, flatly, \"I am not living a life that I feel is worth living at this moment.\"               Em's experience with such unrelenting rejection may sound extreme, but their story speaks to a panic and despair pervasive among members of Gen Z. Lately, I find that the tone people over 30 most often use when talking about today's young adults is less a reflexively finger-wagging \"kids these days\" and more a genuine sympathy over (mixed with relief to have dodged) the particular set of historical circumstances they've faced as they've come of age: COVID-19, climate anxiety, the chaos of the Trump administrations, the internet's wholesale usurpation of IRL culture, AI's potential to upend entire industries. Gen Z has been called the most anxious generation, the most risk-averse generation, the most stressed generation, the most burned-out generation, and the loneliest generation. Last year, the World Happiness Report dubbed Zoomers the unhappiest generation.               But there's another superlative \u2014 one exacerbating all that stress, anxiety, loneliness, and burnout \u2014 that's so far been overlooked. By several measures, Gen Z may be the most rejected generation in human history.               Every cohort believes it has drawn the shortest straw; as Will Smith, a Gen Xer, famously groused, \"Parents just don't understand!\" But as Gen Zers strain to establish themselves, they face a uniquely fraught tension between unprecedented technology-enabled opportunity \u2014 infinite possibilities a click, swipe, or DM away \u2014 and an unprecedented scale of rejection. From education to careers to romance, never before have young adults had this much access to prospective yeses. And, in turn, never before have young adults been told no so frequently.               What does the experience of this new scale of rejection do to a young person's psyche, and to Gen Z's collective state of mind? And how will it reverberate through the rest of society as Gen Z eventually takes the reins of power \u2014 when the rejectees become the rejectors? In interviews with psychologists, therapists, guidance counselors, career coaches, and more than a dozen Gen Zers (most of whom, like Em, requestedI use their first name only to not hinder their job hunt), the ascendant generation's worldview-warping experience of mass rejection in the dating scene, college admissions, and the job market came into focus. At stake is not young adults' egos or sense of entitlement but our expectation of agency in an increasingly mediated world.               Through the 1960s, most Americans got married in their early 20s to partners they met through their social circles. Today, they spend nearly a decade longer dating; the median age for first marriage is 31.1 for men and 29.2 for women. During that additional eon, they're also equipped with an arsenal of apps that can summon \u2014 and terminate \u2014 new prospects on a daily, if not hourly, basis. If we tallied up the literal sum of all the unreciprocated swipes, DMs, follows, or texts that create today's ambient mode of romantic rejection, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that a typical Zoomer on the apps is getting rejected by, and rejecting, more prospective partners in a week than a typical married boomer has in their entire life.               The paradox of online dating has been thoroughly documented: Despite having more access to potential partners than ever, young people have invented vocabularies to describe the endless purgatorial disappointments of \"ghosting,\" \"situationships,\" \"breadcrumbing,\" and the hellscape of the apps themselves. Last year, Hinge surveyed 15,000 people about their dating views. Ninety percent of Gen Z respondents said they wanted to find love, and 44% said they had little or no dating experience.               \"That was a surprising number for me,\" Logan Ury, Hinge's director of relationship science, tells me. Much of that gap is due to Gen Z's heightened risk aversion, Ury says, something she attributes to a social-media-augmented awareness of the world as a scary place and widespread \"overparenting,\" or helicopter parenting. \"Rejection is intimidating for everyone, but Gen Z daters seem to feel it more acutely,\" she adds. Fifty-six percent of Gen Z respondents said that fear of rejection held them back from pursuing a relationship, compared with 51% for millennial respondents.               So as young people relentlessly reject each other, many are too scared to risk truly putting themselves out there in the first place. \"It is so easy to get involved with someone and then detach,\" Catherine, a recent Barnard grad, says. \"I have friends who have been texting with people that they met on dating apps for weeks or months, and yet they have never met in person. I actually had a friend who had a date all set up, and she went to the restaurant, and by the time she got there, the guy unmatched her and blocked her on everything before they even had a date.\"               Gen Z has normalized mutual risk aversion, says Jeff Guenther, a licensed therapist who counsels millions of lovelorn Gen Z TikTok users as @therapyjeff. \"It's this funny situation where it's OK to not get back to people, he says. \"Sometimes that's empowering, but then there's the negative effect of all these little mini rejections that eventually cut so deep that somebody might not decide to be vulnerable.\" No wonder that breakup coaches who talk in therapy-speak and dating influencers who claim they can definitively discern \"green flags\" versus \"red flags\" have proliferated, each of them promising to demystify the romantic ambiguity plaguing Gen Z.               Guenther says today's young adults seem quicker to discard connections in favor of the seemingly unlimited reserves of suitors awaiting just a swipe away. \"There's the resilience that comes from the frequent rejection that makes them great at moving on, but then they're less equipped for the real-world relational challenges that require compromise and patience,\" he says.               But Natalie Buchwald, the founder and clinical director of Manhattan Mental Health Counseling, says she sees a distinction between healthy resilience and the blas, noncommittal attitude she sees many Gen Zers deploy to cope with rejection. \"I'm finding there's more of a pervasive numbness that looks like resilience,\" she says. \"But that's not resilience; that's disconnect.\"               Meanwhile, more technology-augmented opportunity has also bred much more rejection in the college admissions industrial complex. Until 1960, more than half of all college applicants applied to just one school. In the 2023-24 admissions season, the average applicant applied to 6.65 Common App-affiliated schools alone, up 7% from the previous year. Just in the past two decades, the number of applications to the country's 67 most selective colleges has tripled to nearly 2 million a year. Gen Zers are knocking on more doors to their future than ever and, in turn, having more doors slammed in their faces. For some, this is shaping their core beliefs on motivation and merit.               Dylan, a 22-year-old New York University student whose high school credentials included varsity rugby and a 4.7 weighted GPA, tells me that he applied to roughly 20 schools \u2014 including most of the Ivies and Stanford \u2014 a number he felt \"insecure\" about compared with his peers. \"I know a lot of people who applied to 20 to 40,\" he says. In the end, he received only three or four acceptances, which was demoralizing. \"I just remember feeling like it wasn't necessarily our qualifications that mattered, that it was just like, hopefully, the right person read it on the right day.\"               Ella, a 20-year-old from Allentown, Pennsylvania, applied to 12 colleges and got rejected from 10. \"I had so much hubris and unfounded confidence,\" she says. \"I just thought, well, I'll only want to go to college if I can get into a 'prestigious school.' They ask, 'Why us?' obviously, and I couldn't tell them why besides it's Harvard.\" In a Substack post she published before her high school graduation, she described how at odds her tenfold rejection was with her belief in simply working hard to succeed. \"I thought that I was going to be someone,\" she wrote. While she's now a junior at Bryn Mawr, Ella tells me she still hasn't gotten over the sting of going to a seemingly less elite school.               Others have taken rejection to court. In February, an 18-year-old from Palo Alto, California, who applied to 18 schools and was rejected from 16, sued the University of California system and the University of Washington, alleging racial discrimination against \"highly-qualified Asian-American candidates.\" \"When the rejections rolled in one after another, I was dumbfounded. What started with surprise turned into frustration, and then finally it turned into anger,\" the student's father told the New York Post.               As a millennial and former teenage overachiever, I also call up the best expert I personally knew: my high school counselor, Kim Klokkenga, who has helped wrangle the collegiate aspirations of the student body at Central Illinois' Dunlap High School for the past 30 years. In her view, the commercialization of college applications is as much responsible as a new generation of helicopter parenting, along with the technologically mediated literal ease of application.               \"Back in the day, I would literally ask a student how many envelopes they wanted,\" Klokkenga says. \"I didn't have people applying to 20-plus schools, like now. It might've been 10 or 12, and that was outlandish!\" (In case you were wondering, I'd been one of her favorite nut jobs, with a total of nine applications in 2010.)               When I ask if she thinks Gen Z students are handling rejection better or worse than previous generations, she says she can't say for sure. \"I have fewer students come in devastated that they didn't get into their schools,\" Klokkenga says. Perhaps they were already steeling themselves against rejection \u2014 another shade of disconnect. \"I am hearing students say, 'Well, I wasn't expecting to get in; I just wanted to apply to see,'\" Klokkenga adds. \"I think they're just throwing them out there sometimes to see what'll stick.\"               Barry Schwartz, a psychologist who famously observed the relationship between consumer choice and satisfaction in his 2004 book, \"The Paradox of Choice,\" distinguishes two types of people: the \"maximizers,\" who want the absolute best option, and the much-happier \"satisficers,\" who go with the \"good enough\" option. Today's perceived infinite-choice standard seems to have given rise to legions of maximizers among Gen Z. Per Schwartz's central argument that overabundance of choice tends to lead to more disappointment, this does not seem to bode well for their general well-being.               But what happens when one's choices are preemptively limited, perhaps relentlessly, via rejection? \"It's possible there's a kind of resilience that people develop when you're applying to 50 schools and it doesn't hurt anymore to get rejected by 47,\" Schwartz tells me. But, much like Buchwald says of rejected romantics, he sees the \"whatever\" reaction among rejected applicants as a \"very self-protective response.\"               \"If you minimize the significance beforehand, then the pain of failure will be less consequential,\" Schwartz says. \"It kind of drives me crazy to see people doing this, especially if it's a reflection of their effort to protect themselves rather than just their cynicism about living in modern society.\"               College is its own gauntlet, but the scale of rejection in the job-hunt is an order of magnitude more hellish. Via LinkedIn, Workday, and the ubiquity of other online job boards, many Zoomers apply to more jobs in a day than many lucky Boomers have in their lives. In February 2025, the average knowledge worker job opening received 244 applications, up from 93 in February 2019, according to data the hiring software provider Greenhouse shared with BI. That's 243 nos \u2014 or ghosted applications \u2014 for every yes. This scattershot reality is not specific to Gen Z, but it's the only reality that the incoming workforce has known.               Among the Gen Zers I talked to, their \"body counts\" of submitted job applications were regularly in the hundreds. Christopher, a 24-year-old who graduated with a finance degree, says he'd applied to 400 jobs in finance and 200 in merchandising before finding a job that still wasn't what he really wanted. His computer science grad friends have been sending applications in the thousands, he says.               Even though the logistics of applying are more or less streamlined, Gen Zers note the disconnect between the effort they're expected to make versus the consideration given in return. Colleges at least have to formally tell you no, while jobs, like a dating app match, tend to ghost at any point in the process. Is it really a mystery why some Gen Zers have started ghosting employers back?               Since graduating from Barnard last year, Catherine has applied to 300 jobs and interviewed for 20 of them. The 23-year-old says her college counselor's advice to deeply invest in her job applications \u2014 via networking, seeking referrals, getting personalized feedback on rsums \u2014 has come to feel ridiculous, given the fact that you could sit through six rounds of interviews, a practice test, and more for a single role and then, after months of waiting, not even get a proper rejection email. For her, the resounding lesson is hard to ignore: It's better not to hope for too much or to try too hard.               \"You have no idea if you're even doing it right,\" Catherine says of the impersonal process, which is often mediated by an unknowable (and highly fallible) screening algorithm. \"You don't have any ability to get feedback. It feels like being in a hedge maze, and there's probably a path through, but you feel like you keep running into walls and you're like, 'Man, if I could just talk to the person who built this.'\" She adds: \"I worked so hard for four years, and I built this great network and support system, and now I'm just sending applications into the void.\"               For Gen Zers, the disenfranchising reality of chasing entire flocks of wild geese has diminished their self-esteem. Lanya, a 22-year-old who graduated last year with a degree in media studies, tells me she thought she had done everything right as a first-gen college student who counted a Nasdaq internship among her achievements \u2014 and feels incredibly guilty that she has yet to find a job. \"Self-worth-wise, this is the lowest I've ever felt,\" she says. \"This is my time to say thank you and pay them back by showing them what they sacrificed was worth it, but I can't help them the way I want to.\"               Dylan, the finance grad, says the job hunt made him modify his expectations for the future. \"I just remember applying to so many and feeling like: I don't care what I get. I just need to survive. I'm not scared of failing; I'm just scared of dying.\"               For others, mass rejection can be liberating. Several Gen Zers tell me their collection of \"we regret to inform you's\" in their inboxes has inspired them to invest more deeply in passion projects, move abroad, or start their own businesses. For many Gen Zers, the influencer economy is the one job market that seems legible to them \u2014 and it's always hiring.               As Gen Z grows older, the rejection and risk they face could easily compound. If you're starting out with a high degree of risk aversion, any pedestrian experience of personal rejection might harden that stance \u2014 which means we could end up seeing Gen Z calcify into incredibly risk-averse adults (and parents). Those who are resilient enough to weather the new standard scale of rejection \u2014 those who continue to shoot their shots \u2014 will eventually gain a firm foothold. But in college, careers, and romance, it's often less a matter of perseverance or merit than it is pure luck. For much of Gen Z, success is increasingly boiling down to a numbers game.               Is the real problem simply the overabundance of options, which puts Gen Zers' expectations on a collision course with reality? No help, of course, is the 24\/7 firehose of comparison and fantasy provided by social media \u2014 which has shaped Gen Z's construct of reality pretty much straight from the womb. Schwartz, the psychologist, acknowledges that a zillion potential mates, schools, or careers that are seemingly so accessible are liable to make us all feel disappointment. \"Some of us live in such a culture of abundance that even if you find some way to limit the options, you are thinking about what's out there,\" he says. Here, I think of a line from Tony Tulathimutte's aptly titled 2024 book, \"Rejection,\" an interlocking series of horror-esque stories of young people who are puzzled by and rage at the world for their arbitrary exclusion: \"His sadness, he knows, is a symptom of his entitlement, so he is not even entitled to his sadness.\"               But Schwartz also believes that the experience of rejection is markedly different from that of disappointment. When you're underwhelmed by your Netflix selection, or when you order what turns out to be a disappointing entre, it's easy to have order envy for your table mates' more tantalizing plates. But while making that choice was a matter of your own agency, \"a rejection is a comment on you,\" Schwartz says. \"It's very hard to just say to yourself, 'Well, Stanford rejects 96% of its applicants. It's impossible to get in,\" he adds. \"It's not a statement about me; it's a crapshoot.' You can say all that stuff, but my guess is you don't really believe it.\"               This, for me, is the most tragic element of Gen Z's rejection arc. We can expect experiences with personal rejection to trigger material consequences and a formative reckoning with one's self-worth or belief systems \u2014 taken as a collective, it's what shapes each generation so that they can turn around and bray at the next one about what they've survived.               But for Gen Z, their fates are increasingly shaped by the uniquely depersonalized, and depersonalizing, forces of technology, primarily the algorithms that pervade modern dating, college admissions, and the hiring process. These algorithms set the rules of engagement for nearly every aspect of Gen Zers' lives, making once analog processes utterly streamlined yet mystifying. No wonder various corners of the culture have responded with cottage industries of layoff coaches, rsum consultants, professional matchmakers, emotional \"courses\" and boot camps, and countless influencers who espouse how to \"hack\" life's algos. For now, the onus is still placed on the individual Gen Zer to buck the system and learn the hacks; it remains to be seen whether Gen Z will collectively reject the very sorting mechanisms that are failing them.               \"There's this technology, whether it's the algorithm or AI, that's sort of against you, and that's something to take into consideration,\" says Guenther, the TikTok-famous therapist. \"You're not being rejected by actual people, but you're being filtered out or rejected by technology. And maybe the anger should be directed at Apple and Google and Tinder and Facebook or Meta.\"               Yet this anger is curiously absent in all my conversations with Gen Zers. For one thing, they're savvy enough to understand that technology itself isn't worth blaming if you aren't addressing the human biases codified in the automation. Instead, the predominant mood was one of resignation, or perhaps acceptance. \"It's a numbers game,\" one current college student says, or a \"waiting game.\"               When we speak again several months after our first conversation, Em has a promising update: After applying to more than 400 jobs, they've found a position at a perfume shop in Oregon. Amid the grueling job hunt, David Graeber's book \"Bullshit Jobs\" dramatically reframed their view of careerism. \"He talks about how humans feel when they can't make an effect on anything \u2014 it is not only psychologically traumatizing, but it creates physical problems,\" Em says, adding that the perfume shop was one of the best jobs they'd ever had. It's 35 hours a week with no benefits. But, Em says, \"every single day in this job, I get the chance to make someone's day \u2014 to actually see my impact on the world, even if on a small scale.\"       Delia Cai is a writer living in New York.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"Image Credits: PanickCat We\u2019re just halfway into March, and we\u2019ve gotten more smartphones than anyone can count! It started with the iPhone 16E launching, followed by all of Mobile World Congress, the debut of Nothing\u2019s 3a and 3a Pro phones, and now while we were patiently waiting for Google\u2019s Pixel 9a to drop, someone on Reddit lifted the covers on Nothing\u2019s CMF Phone 2. Set to launch later this year, the Phone 2 follows last year\u2019s CMF Phone 1 \u2013 a stripped-down, budget version of Nothing\u2019s tech offerings without the transparent design, but with a unique modular backplate designed for third-party accessories. It seems like the trend continues with the CMF Phone 2, featuring the same removable backplate and the knob at the bottom to affix accessories \u2013 but the biggest detail remains the inclusion of a third camera lens, located right near the two main cameras. Details on the camera capabilities remain unclear at this point, but Reddit (where this photo first made its appearance) users are loving another understated design element too \u2013 its compact size. Although we don\u2019t know the exact dimensions, it looks like the phone\u2019s display measures approximately 5.3 to 5.5 inches in size, putting it in iPhone Mini territory. This should be incredible news for people on the market for a small phone! (AI visualization based on leaks) The CMF Phone 2 is expected to be powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chipset, though this remains unconfirmed. If true, it would mark a shift from the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 used in the CMF Phone 1. This chipset is the same as the one in the Nothing Phone (3a), raising questions about how CMF will differentiate its offering. Based on the recently listed BIS (Bureau of Indian Standards) certification, we have confirmation of Nothing listing the new CMF phone with the model number A001, which is notably different from its predecessor\u2019s A015 model number, further fueling speculation that this is an entirely new device rather than a minor refresh. Leaks also suggest the phone could launch in a blue color variant, following a trend seen with the CMF Phone 1. While specific details on display quality, camera hardware, and battery capacity are yet to surface, it is likely that CMF will retain a budget-friendly approach while refining the hardware. Pricing also remains unknown, but considering the CMF Phone 1 launched at \u20b915,999 Indian rupees ($184 USD) expectations are that its successor will land in a similar range. With an April launch hinted at by a Nothing designer, more concrete details should emerge soon.

Here\u2019s how it works.  Atari parts and accessories store Best Electronics stands bravely defiant against the march of time and technology, continuing to serve this increasingly niche retro hardware market \u2014 a whopping 41 years after it was set up. As well as supplying parts, the store continues to source and make new parts, provide support, hints, and tips, and claims to have spent $100,000+ in engineering development. In contrast, the iconic and innovative Atari Corp. behind all the firm's home computers, and advanced consoles like the Lynx and Jaguar, went bankrupt in 1996, almost 30 years ago. Many readers and writers here on Tom's Hardware will have grown up with Atari computers and consoles. Thus it's admirable to see exclusive new and upgraded parts like rubber domes for your ST \/ STE \/ Falcon computer keyboard and all Gold PCB boards for your CX series joysticks, plus lots of other parts, continue to be manufactured and supplied to Atari fans. The retailer also stocks \"a lifetime supply\" of new-old products in some categories. Interestingly, it reveals many of these were warehoused from the \"thousands and thousands of pallets of Atari goods\" it bought when Atari Sunnyvale was liquidated. As a previous owner of Atari ST, Falcon, Lynx and Jaguar hardware, looking through these products is like hunting through a treasure trove. Best Electronics says it lists 5,000+ Atari items on its site. But these are just the most popular items, so if you are after something that appears absent from the extensive parts and components lists, send the store an email to ask after it. Alternatively, go back in retail time by ordering the Best Rev. 10 All Atari catalog \u2014 a paper catalog of over 220 pages, making it about half an inch thick and 1.4 pounds in weight.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"     Tech's artificial intelligence boom is moving fast and some fear it's breaking things vital to human creativity.    Artist Holly Herndon explained how she sees the interaction of generative AI and human creativity during a talk at SXSW 2025 in Austin, Texas. South by Southwest is known for showcasing creativity: in film, music, comedy and other forms of art. But with this year's conference focusing heavily on generative AI, there was no better place to see the collision of human creativity and machine creation up close. What did I find? Technologists who see machine learning making it easier for people to bring ideas to reality. Artists who see AI as an existential threat to their craft's already precarious financial stability -- and a shortcut through vital steps in the creative process. There's more, though: Artists who see AI as another tool in the palette, a way of experimenting with new forms of art that we haven't seen before. \"The best-case scenario is that we enter a time when people are collaborating and creating in ways that we couldn't imagine before,\" said Holly Herndon, a musician and artist who has pioneered the use of machine learning to create new art forms. That's one possible future, but there's still much more to be seen before we know what AI means for creativity. Here's a glimpse. Generative AI can turn ideas into reality faster and more efficiently than a person might be able to do. But there's one key step it's missing, said Hannah Elsakr, global head of new business ventures at Adobe and founder of the company's Firefly generative AI for enterprise.\u00a0 \"The models don't have ideas,\" Elsakr said. \"Only we have ideas.\" Tools like Adobe's Firefly are just that, tools. Elsakr compared the advent of AI image generators to the launch of Adobe Photoshop, which changed how visual artists did their work but didn't take the creativity out of it. What AI tools can do, she said, is make it easier to turn good ideas into art. \"I believe that AI actually is lowering the entry point for all of us to become creative,\" she said. \"I'm not the best hand-drawn artist but now I can envision things in my mind's eye by using Firefly as a tool.\" A similar concept lies behind a tool called SoCreate, which I found on the floor of the SXSW Expo. The app allows users to upload a story script text and images and the AI model will turn it into something that resembles a cross between a slideshow and an audiobook. At SoCreate's booth, AI-generated pictures of pirates or cars racing around the streets of Los Angeles aligned with AI-generated voices reading the user's scripts. It's not turning your ideas into a movie but turning your words into something a little more audiovisually appealing than words on a page. Founder and CEO Justin Couto said the goal is to provide people who don't have the tools or skills to make films with a way to see their ideas come to life, just a bit. \"They just don't have the equipment or even traditional skills to do that,\" he told me. \"But they have the skills to tell amazing stories and so we're enabling those storytellers to see their visions come alive.\" Also on the Expo floor was an app called Soundraw, which allows you to choose from some musical presets to create a song. I tinkered around with it, tapping a few buttons to get an AI-generated acoustic R&B song with dreamy vibes. The app worked quickly and adjusted when I removed the guitars from some measures or added drums to others. A tap on the screen could change the rhythm or the key. Soundraw is intended to provide creatives and musicians with backing tracks or background music, COO Tao Romera told me, not to displace the music industry. The idea is that a Youtuber, for instance, could dial in a specific track with a specific mood for a specific length of time and use it as an audio track for a video. A rapper could generate beats to perform over. The licensing agreement of Soundraw even requires users to modify the product in some way before distributing it, Romera said.\u00a0 Soundraw's app allows you to create music quickly using generative AI. Romera said Soundraw's model was trained on music made in-house by the producers who work for the company, not on copyrighted music. Some models are trained using copyrighted music and create complete songs from a prompt. \"They really want to replace the whole music business, the artists they're feeding their AI with, which is so ironic,\" he said. Playing around with the app as the self-described world's worst guitarist, I could envision myself creating instantaneous backing tracks to practice over, like a jam partner whose schedule is always open. But the music didn't feel, on its own, all that real. I'm not the only one who gets that sense from AI-generated music. \"If there's not a real person behind it who had feelings and expressed those feelings through that story, I am pretty skeptical whether people are going to be able to connect with that,\" Romera said. \"Because, like, what am I connecting with? This was just created by a machine.\" One ballroom over from the SXSW Expo and its AI tools is a completely different world. It's called Flatstock, a show of posterboard artists and screen printers. You can easily watch your paycheck roll up and vanish into a cardboard tube, with musicians' show posters in a dozen styles. And this work? It's all done by human hands. Maybe a touch of Photoshop. But not by generative AI tools like Midjourney. That's by design: The Poster Institute, which put on the show, doesn't allow AI-generated art. Terrence \"Tuffy\" Ryan, a San Francisco-based artist and president of the institute, said the AI policy stems from the fact that artists haven't been compensated for their art being used to create a tool that competes with them. \"Our biggest concern is that it's taking money out of our pockets and it's a real threat to our entire industry,\" Ryan said. Artists I talked to were not fans of generative AI tools and the designs they create but that doesn't mean they haven't investigated. Ryan said he experimented with image-generating tools last year. The results were \u2026 boring. He found the work to be\u00a0 homogenized, combining disparate styles to form something lacking distinct characteristics. Even when it gets the usual number of human fingers and toes correct, it gets repetitive in its detail work.\u00a0 \"I think when you see something that's AI, there's just that uncanny valley thing going on, where, like, sometimes you might even know what is in it, but you're subconsciously picking up on whatever that is,\" he said. Taylor Adams, a poster artist from Alabama, also said his experiments with it were underwhelming. \"It feels like I'm just pulling a slot machine and something random's coming out,\" he said. \"And no matter how hard you paint over it, it doesn't do what I want it to do. By the time I'm done with it, I could have just drawn it in the first place.\" Another artist, Barry Blankenship, said he hasn't used the tools and won't. His concerns stem from the use of copyrighted images to train the models. \"In my opinion, I don't see any ethical AI on the market today,\" he said. In the minds of many artists, these tools try to find shortcuts through essential components of creating art. The time and practice it takes to form a style are what make art compelling, Blankenship said. In the study of art history, for example, time isn't just spent on how an artist chose colors or applied paint to the canvas but on that person's life and existence. You can't fully appreciate Vincent Van Gogh's work, for instance, without understanding his mental and emotional state (and the time he cut off his ear).\u00a0 \"If you're just taking away from the process and just removing the process entirely and just basing it off of existing artwork, how does that help an artist?\" Blankenship said. \"How does that help the world? I just don't see it.\" Poster artists sold their work in the same Austin Convention Center where speakers and tech companies discussed the use of generative AI to create images at SXSW 2025 in Austin, Texas. What do these artists want? For one, they want to have a say in how the future of art takes shape. Adams said it's better for AI companies to involve artists up front to reach a system that works for everyone rather than waiting for the inevitable lawsuit that might lead to a big payout.\u00a0 \"It is easier to just pay that fee rather than try and get something working ahead of time,\" he said. There is another option. Some artists are finding creative ways to use AI not to replace the tools to make traditional art but to make something that would've been unfathomable a few years ago. The musician Will.i.am, in a conversation with Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, called these people \"hyper-creators,\" people who are doing entirely new art. He compared it to the change brought to the music industry by recording -- which was totally different from the printed music world of classical composers. These artists will be \"just reimagining the concept of a song. What is music?\" Holly Herndon's work gives a glimpse at what this looks like. Herndon's art tackles the meta aspects of generative AI. She trained an AI model on her voice and then allowed people to sing through it. It's called Holly+.\u00a0 Herndon calls this type of work \"protocol art.\" It's more akin to performance art than it is to releasing an album or selling a painting. \"It's not about trying to control the process as something that the artist owns alone,\" she said. \"It's about creating a sort of rule set where you want people to take the idea and fork it and run with it.\" Herndon worked with machine learning for years before OpenAI's ChatGPT launch in 2022 set off the current generative AI boom. Despite her affection for machine learning as a tool, she has serious concerns about how these models are trained and what this means for working artists, especially those trained on others' intellectual property. \"If we don't come up with a solution that really honors creators and IP holders in this generative AI ecosystem, then we're headed toward a situation where the internet becomes less open and free, becomes more locked down, and we have to have a more defensive approach,\" she said. It isn't the AI that makes Herndon's work so interesting. It's the fact that she's using these technologies to amplify herself and her own creativity. The tech experts at SXSW know that AI-generated art that misses the human element won't resonate with people. \"Humans are complicated, and AI systems will not replace us,\" said Oji Udezue, who has led product teams for several tech companies. \"They can't love, they can't trust, they can't do so many things that actually make us human, and we can smell that out.\"","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":" Not necessarily, but a teardrop trailer is the best way for an individual, or even a couple \u2013 in some cases \u2013 to head out on a private camping adventure. The desire to create unforgettable adventures in teardrop trailers has got many enthusiasts to set foot in the workshops and create custom trailers to explore the great outdoors. In our time, we have seen some interesting iterations from people building teardrop campers in their backyard, but a generous number of them are as barebones as a teardrop can get. Of course, they work \u2013 they keep the inhabitant(s) warm, dry and comfortable \u2013 but they are limited in functionality and do not stand a chance in the wilderness, if you desire to extend your stay by even a day. Besides these limitations, most DIY teardrop trailers are quite similar in their appearance as well. Argonaut Teardrop Camper \u2013 enthusiastic custom trailer builders with only online appearance on YouTube \u2013 have shared a construction video (from scratch to finish) on their channel, depicting how a teardrop can be distinctive in its appearance and functionality. With a full galley kitchen, a comfortable queen bed, and storage enough to carry sizable home supplies on an adventure, the Argonaut teardrop trailer is clearly a trendsetter. Designer: Argonaut Teardrop Camper        I have really come to like how Argonaut team has managed to create all the storage compartments within the really small space (the actual measurements are not available but the apparent form factor is pretty small). Where it actually differs, and maybe is able to create more living space, is the height. The slanting shape achieved opens the interior for more headroom, while offering the custom teardrop camper a mini-tank-like appearance on the outside with a forward tilting shape. Not that we have any references to substantiate its off-roading ability, but we can speak for a fact that its metal accents on the wooden frame do provide it with durability and a timeless finish.        The interior walls and custom-built storage cabinets are made from Baltic Birch and comprise a very roomy space. It features a queen bed in the center surrounded by lots of storage and a few cargo nets in the front and cabinets on the side with a TV set wall mounted in between at the back. Peeking windows allow in natural light and a max fan on the ceiling helps regulate the temperature internally.   The rear of the Argonaut teardrop trailer is where the magic lies. Hidden under a hatch here is a handmade kitchen big enough to let you prepare a meal for a small gathering. To ensure you remain stocked up for longer on the road, it has plenty of storage space, electric points, and recessed cabinetry. You get a two-burner stove with sink, prep area and maybe stock up a fridge when touring during warmer months. The Argonaut makes provision for water storage, propane tank, solar panels and batteries on board, just to ensure off-grid living is possible with this little camper.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"Login  Peter  16 March 2025   Deals  After the MWC rush, this week has been fairly quiet in terms of new launches, but the arrival of the Nothing Phone (3a) could make a big splash in the market \u2013 more so than the Galaxy A56, which is yet to come and might have its lunch eaten by the Galaxy S24 FE once it does arrive. The Nothing Phone (3a) is a mid-ranger and is available in two configurations, both under \u00a3400. Nothing doesn\u2019t do small phones, so this one is equipped with a 6.77\u201d 1080p+ display (120Hz, 10-bit, HDR10+, 3,000 nits). Instead of a Dimensity chip, the company picked a Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 this time around. The battery is a 5,000mAh cell with 50W wired-only charging. The camera setup includes a 50MP main (1\/1.57\u201d, OIS) and now a 50MP 50mm telephoto (2x), plus an 8MP ultra-wide and a 32MP selfie. Check out our hands-on review for camera samples. If that isn\u2019t enough camera for you, you may want to wait a couple of weeks for the Nothing Phone (3a) Pro to arrive. Speaking of, the Nothing Phone (3a) Pro gets a better tele camera \u2013 a 70mm periscope with OIS (sorely needed at longer focal lengths) and a 50MP sensor. The main camera adds Dual Pixel AF, while the selfie camera gets a 50MP sensor capable of 4K @ 30fps video capture (the regular (3a) selfie cam tops out at 1080p). Another thing to note is that the Pro has an eSIM, which is becoming a must-have for travel. One last thing to note, you can get a pair of Nothing Ear (a) TWS buds for just \u00a315 more (these go for \u00a380 on their own right now). While we wait for Samsung to release the Galaxy A56, here\u2019s a look at the Galaxy S24 FE. It costs more \u2013 the A56 256GB is \u00a3500 \u2013 but the S24 FE is paired with free Galaxy Buds FE and a Galaxy Fit3. Plus, it has a faster chipset (Exynos 2400e vs. 1580), better water resistance (IP68 vs. IP67), a telephoto camera (8MP 75mm) and a USB-C port capable of outputting DeX to an external display. Note that S24 FE\u2019s battery is smaller (4,700mAh vs. 5,000mAh) and slower to charge with a cable (25W vs. 45W), but it also has a wireless option (15W). For the same price as the S24 FE, you can have a Xiaomi 14T Pro instead. This comes with the slightly faster Dimensity 9300+, plus a higher quality display \u2013 with 144Hz refresh rate and 12-bit colors, plus Dolby Vision. And the 5,000mAh battery on this one can do 120W over USB-C and 50W with the right wireless charger. The camera system includes a 50MP main with a larger sensor, 50MP 60mm telephoto and a 12MP ultra-wide. A couple of weeks ago, we looked at the iPhone 16e while it was still on pre-order. It became available at the end of February, but there are no discounts yet. You can also look at the iPhone 16 and 15, both of which have a token discount of \u00a360. The 16 is a strict upgrade over the 16e, though it does cost \u00a3140 more, even with the discount. The iPhone 15 loses Apple Intelligence but gains a 12MP ultra-wide camera and a Dynamic Island instead of a notch. Plus, both the 16 and 15 have proper MagSafe support. And the 15 is only \u00a340 more than the 16e. Apple released its new tablets and computers this week. The new basic iPad now flaunts 128GB base storage, but not enough RAM or chipset performance to run Apple Intelligence. The A16 chipset still offers a performance boost over the 2022 model, but this and the storage are the only things that Apple changed. Apple recently refreshed the iPad mini and while it picked an older chipset for it as well, at least it went with an A17 Pro and paired it with enough RAM to run Apple Intelligence. Even if you don\u2019t care about AI, the extra performance is tangible. The mini is currently \u00a3100 more than the vanilla model, but make sure that the smaller (8.3\u201d vs. 11\u201d) form factor is right for you. We may get a commission from qualifying sales.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"Login  Ro  16 March 2025   Apple iOS Rumors  Reportedly, Apple is preparing to launch an iPhone 17 Ultra this year. But we've heard that one before, at least a couple of times. There were rumors right before the iPhone 15 and the iPhone 16 series releases claiming that the Ultra would either replace the Pro Max or sit above it. Now, the very same rumor is back. According to a report on the Naver blog, the upcoming iPhone 17 Ultra will replace the Pro Max. The claim stems from supply chain market analysis, suggesting that Apple is preparing to launch a phone with new hardware features. For instance, the Ultra will likely adopt a smaller Dynamic Island, and given the amount of orders, it's not enough to cover both the Pro and Ultra. The report also suggests that the Ultra will be the only one to adopt a vapor chamber cooling system, and it will feature a larger battery than last year's Pro Max. As a result, it will be thicker too. It may sound like a stretch to some, but keep in mind that Apple has been using the Ultra designation for some of its products, like the Apple Watch Ultra or the M3 Ultra chip. Additionally, offering an iPhone Ultra with a substantial hardware upgrade gives Apple leeway to hike the phone's price and potentially increase profit margins too. Still, it's a bit early to tell if the report is correct, but we will monitor the story as it progresses. Source from camera layout to naming , for apple copying xiaomi is never enough. Luckily apple's kult are dumb to understand this. So original move. S10e is 6 years old at this point and kind of forgotten, whilst S25 Ultra is current offering from the Samsung and it would too on the nose for the Apple to copy that. \r  \r But, in the end who knows...  They might do that anyways.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"David L. Farquhar on technology old and new, computer security, and more Home \u00bb Retro Computing \u00bb Amiga 600: The Amiga no one wanted The Amiga 600 was one of the last Amigas, and it became a symbol of everything wrong with Commodore and the product line. Retro enthusiasts like it today because of its small size, so it\u2019s the perfect retro Amiga for today. But it couldn\u2019t have been much more wrong for the time it was introduced, March 11-18, 1992 at the CeBit show. The Amiga 600 was a cost-reduced Amiga for home use, similar in size and appearance to a Commodore 64. But internally it wasn\u2019t much more than a repackaged Amiga 1000 from 1985, trying to compete with VGA graphics and 386 CPUs.  The Amiga 600 shows how Commodore didn\u2019t understand its previous successes and failures. When Commodore was at its best, the process looked something like this. It decided on a price point to hit. Then its engineers built the computer they would want while staying within that budget. Most of Commodore\u2019s engineers were computer enthusiasts themselves, so it was like a car company selling cars designed by car enthusiasts. The machines built momentum fairly quickly. Other enthusiasts took to the machines, built peripherals and software to go with it, and created an ecosystem that sold the computer. Commodore\u2019s marketing rarely said much more than their computer was better and cheaper than the others. For a while, that was all it took. The Amiga 600 was the opposite of all that. It was 1985 technology repackaged to look as much like 1982 technology as possible, priced at $500 and released in 1992. But that didn\u2019t include a monitor and hard drive. You wanted those. By the time you added a monitor and a hard drive to get the system you really wanted, it cost closer to $1,000. At that price, you could get an off-brand PC with a VGA monitor. It wouldn\u2019t be great. But it also didn\u2019t feel like someone ripping you off with expensive add-ons. Or you could pay $200 more and get a pretty nice PC with lots of expansion capability. Either way you went, the PC seemed like a better value. And as 1992 wore on, that PC came down in price while Amiga prices held mostly steady. The Amiga 600 failed, and Commodore discontinued it in 1993. No one noticed though. Commodore still had inventory when it folded in 1994 so you could still get one if you wanted one. They had refurbished Amiga 500s too, so you could get one of those instead. And that\u2019s what the people in the know went for, if they bought an Amiga instead of a PC. In most ways, the Amiga 600 was just a cut-down version of the Amiga 500. Launched in 1987, the Amiga 500 had been pretty successful. It initially cost $695 when released, and was also a cut-down version of the Amiga 1000, repackaged in a single piece with a full keyboard that resembled the now-ubiquitous PC keyboard layout of today. An ecosystem sprung up around the Amiga 500 because it was really expandable. It featured a port on the side where you could plug in a hard drive or CD-ROM drive, and a trapdoor expansion that could take additional memory. If you were willing to tinker, you could expand it inside, because all of the major chips were in sockets. Lots of Amiga 500 add-0ns were circuit boards that plugged into chip sockets. The Amiga 600 dispensed with most of that. All of the chips except the system ROM were soldered to the motherboard, so all the wonderful internal A500 expansions didn\u2019t work anymore. The expansion port on the side disappeared, with a PCMCIA port in its place. That\u2019s nice today, but in 1992, PCMCIA peripherals were fairly scarce. The keyboard shrunk down to something resembling today\u2019s 40% keyboards. The only improvement it featured over the A500 was having a 44-pin IDE port on the motherboard. It was fully software-compatible with the A500, but most of the peripherals that had sprung up around it over the previous five years had to be redesigned. It was a dated machine, with no hardware ecosystem around it, and offered no significant price savings over the machine it replaced. At one point, the Amiga 600 was going to be called the Amiga 300 and sold as a cut-down Amiga. That sounds like a solution in charge of a problem but at least wouldn\u2019t have meant discontinuing a machine that still sold well. Discontinuing a machine that was still selling and replacing it with one with a name that made it sound like an upgrade when it wasn\u2019t created new problems for a company that didn\u2019t need any more new problems. Both the Amiga 500 and 600 featured a Motorola 68000 CPU running at 7 MHz. In 1987 this was fine. By 1992, that 68000 was competing with 16 MHz 386SX CPUs, which at least sounded much better. The perceived value of a 386SX at 16 MHz was much higher than that of a 7 MHz 68000. Apple discontinued its last computer based on the 68000 CPU in October 1992, which shows Commodore didn\u2019t need to be trotting out a new machine based on that chip in March. They also had 4-voice, stereo sound. In 1987, the Amiga\u2019s sound was as good as it got. In 1992, a cheap PC couldn\u2019t keep up. It either came with the standard PC speaker, or 3-voice Tandy sound, if you bought a Tandy 1000. But you could get an add-on card. By 1992, you could get a Sound Blaster with 22-voice sound. It cost more, but the perceived value was much higher too. But the biggest problem was the graphics. In 1985, the Amiga\u2019s 640\u00d7200 resolution and ability to display up to 4,096 colors was revolutionary. But 1987 saw the introduction of VGA, with the ability to display 256 colors from a palette of 262,144 colors, and a maximum resolution of 640\u00d7480. It was shockingly expensive in 1987, but prices came down rapidly. The Amiga\u2019s graphics lended themselves well to 2D platform-style games and allowed the Amiga to punch above its weight. A stock Amiga 600 can play a Commander Keen-style game just as smoothly as a faster PC. But in May 1992, id Software dropped Wolfenstein 3D, the first 3D first-person shooting game. It ran reasonably well on a 386sx-based PC with VGA graphics, while nothing comparable existed on the Amiga. While a brand-name 386SX with a VGA monitor cost slightly more than an Amiga 600 with a monitor and comparable hard drive, it could do something fun that an Amiga couldn\u2019t do. People will pay more money if it seems like it\u2019s worth it. And with every succeeding month in 1992 and 1993, the value proposition favored the PC more and more. Commodore\u2019s bad decisions have led to a ton of armchair quarterbacking over the years, especially around the C-128 and C-65, and many of those ideas weren\u2019t technologically possible at the time. One thing Commodore could have done fairly easily would have been to replace the CPU. ICD had an accelerator board for the Amiga 500 containing a 68000 CPU running at 14 MHz. Supra had an even better one, the Supra Turbo 28, with a 68HC000 running at 28 MHz. These made the Amiga noticeably faster, without costing a lot of money and while maintaining very high compatibility with the original. Commodore\u2019s engineers could have redesigned the A600 motherboard to accommodate a faster 68000. They had the ability. A faster CPU would have made the A600 look better on paper, and made Amiga owners more willing to forgive its other shortcomings. Commodore might have even been able to raise the price a little to eek out a little more much-needed profit margin. Putting the AGA chipset in the A600 would have also helped. The CPU still would have hurt, but the graphics would have been more competitive. But there\u2019s a problem with that idea: the AGA chipset wasn\u2019t ready to ship in March. The blame for the Amiga 600 primarily lies on Commodore product manager Bill Sydnes. Sydnes had been the product manager for IBM\u2019s doomed PCjr. His influence showed. He took a successful product, made a cut-down version of it, and made it look like the machine that beat his PCjr in the marketplace. Amiga engineers called it the Amiga Junior and got in trouble for doing so. Had Commodore been able to cut the price significantly, consumers might have accepted it. The problem was the redesign didn\u2019t have a lot to work with. Reducing the board size and changing to newer, cheaper capacitors saved a few dollars, but the big money was elsewhere. The Amiga\u2019s custom chipset was still being manufactured using a dated manufacturing process. Commodore\u2019s MOS subsidiary used a 3.5  \u00b5m manufacturing process, while Intel and other chip manufacturers were using a 1 or 1.5 \u00b5m process in 1985. By 1992, the rest of the industry had moved on to a .8 or .6 \u00b5m process. This meant Commodore\u2019s competitors went from getting twice as many chips per wafer in 1985 to getting 3-5 times as many chips per wafer in 1992, so they could lower their prices much more quickly. That\u2019s why Commodore couldn\u2019t price a bare A600 at $199 or $299. At that price, it might have had a chance because it could be the computer you bought if you couldn\u2019t afford anything else. At $499, you had enough money to have other options, whether that meant a dated PC\/XT clone, a used or refurbished Amiga 500, or saving up a few more months to get a more current PC. Commodore\u2019s ability to make its own chips had been a big advantage in 1982. Its process was out of date even then, but was competitive enough that it saved money by making them itself. Ten years later, it didn\u2019t. Commodore had an ace in the hole in 1992: The Amiga 1200. Unlike the Amiga 600, it was a real improvement over the Amiga 500, with a faster 32-bit 68EC020 CPU running at 14 MHz, and VGA-like AGA graphics. In some ways it was too little, too late and it probably was. But the Amiga had a cult following, and it was enough to keep that niche interested, especially in Europe where the Amiga had a bigger following. The problem was MOS technology couldn\u2019t make the new chips. They were too complex. Commodore farmed out the graphics chip to HP and the memory\/bus controller to VLSI. But since it wasn\u2019t used to working with outside suppliers, it didn\u2019t get the order in soon enough to get the chips in large quantities. So when Christmas 1992 came around, Commodore didn\u2019t have enough chips to keep up with Amiga 1200 demand. The Amiga 600 came out in March 1992 and the A1200 came out in October. Commodore couldn\u2019t make up its mind which machine to build, and stepped right into the Osborne effect. In a perfect world, Commodore would have decided much earlier in the year to go with the Amiga 1200 so it could at least flood the market at Christmas. Better yet, it would have introduced it earlier in the year. With too few A1200s to meet demand, they tried to make up the difference with Amiga 600s, and that went about as well as you\u2019d imagine. Commodore ended up with piles of unsellable inventory, and the inability to keep up with early demand for the Amiga 1200 meant it lost momentum. Given the choice between going on a waiting list for an Amiga 1200, buying a 386SX immediately, or buying an Amiga 600, many more chose that 386sx. The 386sx looked like a comparable machine and it had Wolfenstein 3D. This meant Commodore had a problem. It had a pile of machines no one wanted. It had money tied up in those machines. That meant Commodore had less money to pay HP and VLSI for chips to make the machines people did want. After a disastrous Christmas 1992 season, Commodore bled cash for five more quarters and went out of business in April 1994. It\u2019s no help to Commodore now, but it seems like more people want an Amiga 600 today than in 1992. It\u2019s small and self-contained, so it takes up less space than other retro systems. You can plug it into a Dell 2001fp or similar monitor and it takes up less space than a PC keyboard. When you\u2019re done with it, you can swap it in for another system and stash the A600 on a shelf or wall bracket. Internally, the A600 takes a 44-pin hard drive or compact flash-to-IDE adapter for storage, and there\u2019s a lot more PCMCIA hardware available now than there was in 1992. And if you want to really hotrod it, the Vampire board featuring a faster CPU and AGA-compatible chipset came out for the A600 before other Amiga models. So today it\u2019s possible to turn the A600 into something compatible with the A1200, only smaller, faster, and better. Even without modification, it\u2019s a smaller and lighter Amiga 500. The A500\u2019s keyboard is better, but if you\u2019re playing games, you probably won\u2019t notice the difference. And that\u2019s the main reason people want a classic Amiga today. If you have multiple classic computers, it\u2019s nice for them to be as small as possible. An Amiga 600 gives the classic Amiga experience in the smallest possible form factor. It was the worst Amiga possible in 1992 but in some ways it\u2019s the ideal Amiga now. The major problem with the A600 is that it uses surface-mount capacitors, a cost-reducing measure from 1992. These capacitors tend to fail and leak, so many A600s don\u2019t work today until you replace the caps. Be sure to ask if the caps have been replaced, and be prepared to replace them if they are original. The electrolyte leaks out and damages the motherboard over time, so be sure to replace the caps if they are still original. Original caps don\u2019t improve the system value, and turn the system into a time bomb. Older Amigas used through-hole caps that weren\u2019t as prone to leak, so there\u2019s nothing wrong with leaving those original. Similarly, many memory expansion boards contain a battery for a real-time clock. Ensure the battery is new, since a leaky battery can damage both the expansion board and the motherboard. The A600 is also very prone to discoloration. While the machine still works, it doesn\u2019t look as nice. Fortunately it responds well to the chemical-free retrobright method to restore its original color. So while the Amiga 600 was the Amiga no one wanted and it neatly summed up everything wrong at Commodore in a neat little package, it\u2019s a very nice retro computer now. It cures Amiga sprawl by packing all the essentials into less space than you need for a C-64. In some ways it\u2019s the original Amiga Mini.

The problem with the capacitors wasn\u2019t that they were surface mount. SMD is ubiquitous now, and there are plenty of reliable parts in that format. The problem is that they were bad SMD capacitors, a problem that wasn\u2019t unique to Commodore. Tektronix oscilloscopes from the late 1980s are notorious now among their enthusiasts for bad SMD electrolytic capacitors in their power supplies; they typically need to be completely recapped. Later, during the period from 1999 to 2007, many PC makers were plagued by bad electrolytic capacitors, mostly through-hole parts this time rather than SMD. There is an article on Wikipedia about it: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Capacitor_plague I covered caps a different day that week. I had lots of first-hand experience with the capacitor plague. my soitek and msi dead from  capacitor plague \ud83d\ude41 how does Amiga os compare with Be  os was there any talk of Amiga moving over to PowerPC like Apple in early 90s? Yes, if Commodore had survived, they would have switched to another CPU. I heard constant rumors of DEC\u2019s Alpha CPU but they would have had every reason to consider PowerPC or MIPS. As for what was better between Amiga OS or BeOS, I\u2019ll never, ever vote against Amiga OS no matter what you run against it. BeOS, running on more powerful hardware, had memory protection and Amiga OS didn\u2019t. But would BeOS have existed without Amiga OS to inspire it? I have to wonder. The Amiga dragged the entire industry kicking and screaming out of the 1970s, skipping the 80s entirely and into the mid 90s. It\u2019s the greatest computer of all time and I will die on that hill. i lived in the usa but when I saw the acorn archimedes\u2026  BeOS, running on more powerful hardware, had memory protection and Amiga OS didn\u2019t. so better than Amiga OS or os\/2? what about bebox? ever blog BeOS? OS\/2 was what I was running circa 1995 instead of BeOS. BeOS was cool but the software I wanted to run could run on OS\/2. I\u2019ve mentioned BeOS here and there and I did mess with it once it was available on Intel, but I\u2019ve never written anything comprehensive about it, so I\u2019ve added it to my list. Can\u2019t promise when I\u2019ll get to it, but I will get to it this year. The Amiga dragged the entire industry kicking and screaming out of the 1970s, skipping the 80s entirely and into the mid 90s. It\u2019s the greatest computer of all time and I will die on that hill. why\u2019d it failed and st but black and white mac and more expensive won? Wasn\u2019t the AAA chipset based around a HP PA CPU? No, HP manufactured the AGA chips for Commodore. But they still used Motorola 68K-series CPUs. Commodore was using HP the way other companies use Samsung and TSMC today. I\u2019ll have to dig up the reference on this, but I think Ed Hepler was designing a PA-RISC chipset. Found it, Dave Haynie mentioned it a few times, and it was Hombre, not ASA, and they were designing it for HP PA. In the era where Alpha and PPC were ascendant and MIPS was a thing, PA seemed odd, but I was just a dumb kid St the time. https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Amiga_Hombre_chipset One of the prototype next gen Amiga platforms, Hombre, was being developed in collaboration with HP using their PA-RISC architecture. Had it ever seen the light of day, it probably would have been very powerful for the time, but probably expensive, and a dead end. I bought a beautiful brand new Amiga 600 in a large package with sone software \u2013 brought it home by train. I remember that day even now. With 20 MB HDD 1 MB RAM and some programs and games as EPIC, Deluxe paint and word processor and some more addons. It was a PERFECT COMPUTER in the 90s for me and I am affraid you do not get it. Commodore designed this exactly for some users as me. Some flight sims did not work well due to missing numpad but that was just one drawback I remember. It had RCA CINCH and I connected it to my home stereo. As a student I was really enjoying each minute with this beautiful machine, be it by programming, composing music, doong graphics renderings or writing papers for school. Excellent machine. It was and still is. Don\u2019t get me wrong, If I had any Macintosh I\u2019d trade it for an Amiga 600 in a heartbeat and get the better of the deal in my mind. But from a marketing standpoint, the Amiga 600 wasn\u2019t the move forward Commodore needed in 1992. If they\u2019d introduced it alongside the Amiga 500 it would have been fine, especially if they\u2019d done it a bit earlier. If they\u2019d introduced something Amiga 600-like in 1987 instead of the Amiga 500, that probably would have been fine too. But in 1992, the Amiga 1200 was what everyone was expecting, and trying to sell 600s at Christmas instead of 1200s didn\u2019t go well. In the end Commodore sold every Amiga they could make, but better execution in 1992 might have let them live another year instead of going under in 1994. what is your favorite 80s and 90s Macintosh ? i once owned a Macintosh  classic ii se\/30 upgrade doesn\u2019t work on the classic ii Favorite Mac? None of them. I really don\u2019t like them, I always thought of them as a waste after I saw Amigas. I\u2019m not a fan of the modern ones either.

Pingback: Amiga 600: From the Amiga No One Wanted to Retro Favorite \u2013 Cyber Geeks Global In 1994 I had an A500 my father brought from West Germany. In 2006, during my teenage years I used it for target practice with a pellet gun because I thoguht it was obsolete and worthless. My PC could run Gothic 2 Noc Kruka while games on Amiga felt pretty lame. It\u2019s slightly unfair to include the cost of buying a monitor in the price of an A600. One of the Amiga\u2019s selling points over a PC was that you could plug it straight into a TV, without needing an expensive monitor. The Commodore monitors could do higher resolutions than a TV, but Amiga games all used TV resolutions. I think only one of my Amiga-owning friends had a monitor. The rest of us just had a hand-me-down TV instead. This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Learn how your comment data is processed.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"Facepalm: It has been nearly two months since Nvidia launched its RTX 50 series Blackwell GPUs, yet the company continues to struggle with significant supply chain issues. Despite rumors of improving availability, scalpers remain prevalent, frustrating not only individual customers but also system integrators.  System integrator PowerGPU has faced substantial challenges in securing RTX 5090 units, forcing it to raise prices. PowerGPU's CEO, Jese Martinez, recently addressed allegations of price-gouging in a video on X, stating that the company itself has fallen victim to scalping by distributors. Martinez explained that the high prices of RTX 5090 GPUs are not due to excessive profit margins but rather the result of PowerGPU having to purchase them at inflated rates. He reported that the company is being offered entry-level to mid-range RTX 5090 models at prices ranging from $3,050 to over $3,100 \u2013 significantly higher than the official MSRP of $1,999. Other custom PC builders, such as iBuyPower and Storm, are also experiencing similar price hikes for the RTX 5090, with prices ranging from $2,900 to over $3,300. A significant video from our founder\/CEO on the RTX 5090 pricing. pic.twitter.com\/6GEvYFkD9K Nvidia claims to have shipped twice as many Blackwell GPUs as Ada Lovelace GPUs within five weeks of launch. However, this metric does little to alleviate the frustration of customers who have been unable to purchase RTX 50 GPUs at their recommended retail price since release. By comparison, AMD's Radeon RX 9070 series launch, while not flawless, has fared better. AMD has maintained somewhat better availability of its Radeon RX 9070 series compared to Nvidia's RTX 50 series, although it's still too soon to tell if MSRPs will be real for most consumers. At launch, AMD ensured a substantial stock of Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT GPUs and partnered with multiple board manufacturers to guarantee more widespread availability.  Despite these efforts, some retailers have quietly increased Radeon RX 9070 series prices by up to $130 above MSRP, mirroring the inflation seen with Nvidia's GPUs. Nonetheless, AMD's strategy has generally allowed consumers to purchase the RX 9070 series with fewer delays and at more stable prices than Nvidia's offerings. The fact that Nvidia GPUs are also in higher demand for AI workloads and not just gaming, means there's more people willing to overpay to gain access to the hardware. Also see: The State of the GPU: All Fake MSRPs? The widespread unavailability of Nvidia GPUs has tarnished the reputation of system integrators. PowerGPU, for instance, has faced a 2-3 week wait for initial shipments, with supply remaining scarce. A recent inventory update revealed a stark contrast: while approximately 70 Radeon RX 9070 series GPUs were available, only one RTX 5090 unit was in stock. The situation is further exacerbated by the depletion of last-generation GPU stock, which began as early as October. Searching for older models like the RTX 4090 often yields no results, leading to \"pandemic-level pricing\" for new GPUs. As a result, many consumers have turned to the used market, where Ampere (GeForce 30) and RDNA 2\/3 GPUs remain widely available.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":" The A-frame house represents one of architecture\u2019s most recognizable forms\u2014a silhouette so elemental it can be drawn with just three lines. This triangular structure, defined by steeply pitched roof planes that extend nearly to the ground, gained immense popularity in post-war America as an affordable and distinctive alternative to conventional home designs. Most commonly associated with vacation cabins in mountain or lakeside settings, the A-frame has rarely been translated into sophisticated urban residential architecture. Designer: Jack Morgan       In Dallas, however, one exceptional residence challenges this typology\u2019s rustic associations. Standing at 7707 Mason Dells Drive, this striking A-frame home transforms what might be considered a limiting structural form into an expansive living environment where light, volume, and material work in harmonious concert. This architectural gem represents the vision of Jack Morgan, who designed the home in 1966 for its original owners, Marvin and Vivian Jones. The property remained in the same family until recently, making its market appearance at $3 million, a rare opportunity to acquire a piece of Dallas architectural history. Morgan\u2019s design showcases his mastery of midcentury principles through bold lines and a seamless indoor-outdoor connection that defines the era\u2019s finest residential work.  The property contains personal elements that reflect the original owners\u2019 story, including a boulder on the front lawn that was reportedly a memento from one of Marvin\u2019s first real estate deals. Such details add layers of historical significance to the home\u2019s architectural importance. Morgan\u2019s work extends beyond this A-frame. He also co-designed the celebrated Meadows Building in Dallas with J.N. McCammon. This A-frame in the upscale JanMar neighborhood shows how versatile and innovative Morgan was as an architect. The home announces itself through its unmistakable silhouette\u2014a sharply pitched roof that creates the classic triangular A-frame profile against the Texas sky. What elevates this particular example is its sophisticated material execution. Warm brick walls provide substantial mass and textural richness, while the front fa\u00e7ade features a dramatic glass entrance that creates an immediate visual focal point.       This entrance deserves careful examination. Framed in black metal with expansive glass panels, it creates a transparent portal that offers glimpses into the illuminated interior. The contrast between solid brick walls and a glass-filled entrance establishes a visual rhythm that continues throughout the home. The house number \u201c7707\u201d is integrated into the composition, adding a subtle graphic element to the fa\u00e7ade. The surrounding landscape complements the architecture with a restrained approach\u2014manicured shrubs and a simple aggregate walkway lead visitors to the entrance. Mature trees frame the property, their organic forms softening the geometric precision of the architecture while providing natural context. Stepping inside reveals the true advantage of the A-frame design\u2014extraordinary vertical space that creates a sense of volume rarely found in residential architecture. The interior soars upward, following the roof\u2019s dramatic pitch, with exposed wooden beams traversing the white ceiling. These structural elements add warmth and visual rhythm while emphasizing the height of the space.  The most remarkable feature is the wall of glass that forms the rear of the main living area. These floor-to-ceiling windows dissolve the boundary between inside and outside, flooding the interior with natural light while framing views of the surrounding landscape. This transparency transforms the outdoor environment into a living backdrop that shifts with daylight and seasons.  Terrazzo flooring provides a sophisticated foundation for the space. This classic midcentury material\u2014with its speckled pattern and subtle reflective quality\u2014adds visual texture while bouncing light throughout the interior. The result is a space that feels larger than its actual dimensions, with light amplified and diffused across surfaces. While preserving the integrity of Morgan\u2019s original design, the home has undergone a meticulous renovation that adapts the space for contemporary living. The thoughtful transformation removed several interior walls to create an effortless flow between the great room and the reimagined chef\u2019s kitchen. This open concept, as the listing notes, \u201cmakes calling something open concept proud to be open concept.\u201d  The kitchen represents a masterclass in modern luxury with its oversized island\u2014\u201dso huge it\u2019s literally a continent,\u201d according to the listing. Premium appliances elevate the culinary experience, including a 48\u2033 Wolf range, a SubZero refrigerator and freezer combo, a SubZero wine cooler, a Scotsman ice maker, and a Cove dishwasher. Custom walnut cabinetry enriches the space, harmonizing with the restored parquet and terrazzo floors throughout the home.  Soaring vaulted and beamed ceilings anchor the grand living space, which is illuminated by $50,000 in Troy Lighting chandeliers. These chandeliers serve as both functional lighting and artistic focal points. Their metallic finish creates moments of brilliance as they catch and reflect light throughout the day.  The renovation included complete updates to essential systems, including new HVAC, a tankless water heater, and a modernized electrical and plumbing infrastructure. These behind-the-scenes improvements ensure the home functions as beautifully as it looks. Perhaps the most extraordinary feature of this 4,189-square-foot residence is its stunning indoor pool area, which adds nearly 1,800 additional square feet to the home. Complete with a wet bar and an adjacent library lined with custom wood shelving, this space transforms the home into an entertainer\u2019s dream, allowing for \u201cswimming under the stars\u201d regardless of weather conditions.  The primary suite opens to a solarium through custom three-track sliders, offering a serene, light-filled retreat. In a remarkable integration of architecture and nature, a living tree grows through the solarium\u2019s floor and extends through the ceiling, creating a seamless connection between the built environment and the natural world. The redesigned bathrooms exude sophistication with exotic quartz, Frank Lloyd Wright collection fixtures, smart toilets, and a luxurious wet room with a freestanding tub. While not a Wright creation, these thoughtful references to the legendary architect\u2019s work create a deliberate connection to his design legacy.  The dining area deserves special mention\u2014positioned to take advantage of the dramatic glass walls, it creates a space where, as the listing poetically describes, \u201claughter fills the air and the aroma of delicious food wafts through the space.\u201d The large, inviting table becomes a centerpiece for gathering, sharing stories, and creating memories.  The interior creates a sophisticated conversation between materials that balances warmth and coolness, texture and smoothness. Rich wood paneling on select walls provides tactile depth and visual warmth while white surfaces elsewhere maximize light reflection. The exposed brick interior walls echo the exterior treatment, creating continuity between inside and outside.  The furniture selection demonstrates a refined approach to contemporary living within a midcentury shell. Clean-lined gray sofas anchor the living space without competing with the architecture. Cognac leather ottomans add warmth and textural contrast. The brass-accented coffee table introduces metallic elements that catch light and add visual interest without overwhelming the space.  In one variation of the A-frame design seen in the images, warm wood ceiling cladding creates a more intimate, cabin-like atmosphere while still maintaining the dramatic A-frame geometry. This demonstrates the versatility of the A-frame concept, which can shift from grand and open to cozy and enveloping through material choices. Perhaps the most compelling aspect of this home is how it choreographs the experience of light. The vast glass expanses allow sunlight to penetrate deep into the interior, creating ever-changing patterns as the sun moves across the sky. The high ceilings prevent the space from feeling confined despite the triangular constraints, instead creating a cathedral-like atmosphere of openness and elevation.  The home demonstrates how architectural constraints\u2014in this case, the triangular limitations of the A-frame\u2014can become opportunities for dramatic spatial experiences. Rather than fighting against the sloped walls, the design embraces them as defining elements that create a unique living environment, unlike conventional homes. This Dallas A-frame represents a sophisticated interpretation of a form often associated with vacation cabins and mountain retreats. By executing the A-frame in brick rather than the more typical wood cladding, and by incorporating refined finishes and furnishings, the home elevates what could be a casual architectural style into something permanently residential and sophisticated.  Set on 0.61 acres in the prestigious JanMar neighborhood, the home\u2019s successful integration of dramatic form, thoughtful material selection, and connection to the outdoors creates a living environment that feels both sheltering and expansive. It demonstrates how architectural boldness, when executed with restraint and attention to detail, can create spaces that remain relevant and compelling across decades. As this remarkable property enters the market at $3 million, it offers more than just a home\u2014it presents an opportunity to inhabit a piece of architectural poetry where geometric constraints have been transformed into spatial liberation. In the hands of a visionary architect like Jack Morgan, the simple A-frame form becomes something extraordinary: a living environment that continues to inspire and delight more than half a century after its creation.

{"date":"2025-03-16","content":"For most of the last decade, being a software engineer has been a lot of fun. Every company offered lots of perks, layoffs and firings were almost unheard of, and in general we were treated as special little geniuses who needed to be pampered so we could work our magic. That\u2019s changed in the last two years. The first round of tech layoffs in 2023 came as a shock, but at least companies were falling over themselves to offer generous severance and teary CEO letters regretting the necessity. Two years later, Meta is explicitly branding its layoffs as \u201cthese were our lowest performers, good riddance\u201d. What the hell happened?1 What does it mean for us? In the 2010s, interest rates were zero or close to zero2. Investors could thus borrow a lot of money. Much of that money was spent on tech companies in the hope of outsized returns. Tech companies were thus incentivized to (a) hire like crazy, and (b) do a lot of low-risk high-reward things, even if that ends up wasting money. Tech companies definitely did not have to be profitable. In fact, they didn\u2019t even need to make money - they just had to acquire users, or at least hype, to drive up the valuation of the company itself. In that environment, throwing money at their software engineers (in the form of paid trips, in-house chefs, and huge comp packages) was a sensible business decision. In 2023, this underlying economic situation reversed: interest rates went up to around 5%3. Tech company incentives completely flipped: now it\u2019s suddenly important to be profitable, or at least to make lots of money. That means it\u2019s not wise for most companies to hire like crazy, or to continue throwing near-unlimited amounts of money at their software engineers. I think that\u2019s a sufficient explanation for the vibe shift all by itself. What about COVID? It helped, but it wasn\u2019t the root cause. Two years (or thereabouts) of people staying inside more meant much more engagement with tech products, which meant much more money flowing into tech companies. Everyone was hiring during COVID. Once that short-term boom finished, companies naturally wanted to get rid of some of those engineers, which is what triggered a lot of the initial layoffs. However, I do think that even without COVID, we\u2019d still be in something like the current situation. Companies were constantly hiring pre-2020 as well. This idea that AI is taking software engineering jobs or contributing to layoffs is - as far as I can tell - currently pure fantasy. I do believe in the power of AI, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it takes software jobs at some point in the future, but it\u2019s certainly not behind the vibe shift in software engineering right now. I think a lot of software engineers right now are planting their feet and refusing to change. After ten years of their opinion being consulted on big company decisions, they\u2019re trying to hold on to that power. I have respect for anyone who stands up for what they think is right at personal cost. I just want to stress that there is going to be a personal cost to not going along with the vibe shift, particularly for more junior or more vulnerable engineers. As someone who lives in Australia, I feel pretty vulnerable myself. The biggest thing to internalize is that companies now are actually trying to focus. In 2015, there was a lot of appetite to do everything at the same time: building out new product lines, transitioning from a product to a platform, making significant open-source contributions, working on a top-tier developer experience, and so on. In 2025, most of these initiatives have been abruptly defunded in order to put more resources into a handful of bets that the company executives actually care about. During the 2010s, it was as if companies were their software engineers, and were interested in the same things as their engineers were. A lot of engineers were fooled by this into identifying strongly with their employer. But this was a mirage: in part caused by companies\u2019 desire to attract and retain talent, and in part by there being no real pressure on companies to say no to anything. Now the mirage has vanished. Companies are their executive leadership, and their executive leadership are interested in a much smaller set of things. If you were an engineer who loved working on your company\u2019s open-source libraries, it\u2019s probably sensible to confront the fact that the company never really cared about it that much. When interest rates were zero, it was worth doing because most things were worth doing. At 5% interest rates, most open-source work doesn\u2019t meet that bar. In other words, your interests now conflict with your company\u2019s interests. It\u2019s okay for your interests to conflict with your company\u2019s. You get to decide what you care about, and what you\u2019re willing to fight for. But when you act in ways that don\u2019t further your company\u2019s interests, you risk being seen as ineffective or unreliable. In 2025, that makes you vulnerable to being laid off. The good news is that tech companies now live in (or at least a lot closer to) the \u201creal world\u201d. It was nice to be pampered, but there was a fundamental ridiculousness about it, even at the time. I know a lot of engineers who found that offputting, including myself. It\u2019s why many engineers found the TV show Silicon Valley hard to watch - the satire was too real to laugh at. It was mainly embarrassing. If I had to choose, I\u2019d definitely choose to return to the job market of the 2010s, so I can be paid more to work less and have more job security. I\u2019m not an idiot. But the silver lining to actually having to ship is that you\u2019re no longer living in a dream. If you\u2019re realistic about how things work, the job of software engineering becomes much easier to understand: It\u2019s not much of a mission statement! Certainly nothing on \u201cmaking the world a better place\u201d. But it has the comforting solidity of the truth. The good thing about the music finally stopping is that you don\u2019t have to worry about when it\u2019s going to stop. I wrote this post because I had a conversation with some engineer friends who were commenting on the vibe shift, and then the next morning read Will Larson\u2019s advice to engineering leaders. This was a more-or-less intentional decision to aid recovery from the 2008 crash. Likely as an intentional decision to combat runaway inflation (but at this point it\u2019s very much not my field).
