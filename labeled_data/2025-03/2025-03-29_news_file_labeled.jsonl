Your yard and your garage shouldn\u2019t be the only spring cleanings on your to-do list. Your laptop or PC could benefit from a cleanup too, which thankfully won\u2019t leave you sore the next day like those other jobs. The only tool you\u2019ll need to get your digital spring cleaning done is a great large-capacity external disk drive, and the SanDisk Extreme has been one of the very best for years now. Amazon is running deals taking over 30% off the price of the 2TB and 4TB models of the updated SanDisk Extreme Gen 2 portable SSD, bringing the price of the 2TB down to just $136 down from $199 and the 4TB to $247: The 31% price cut on the 4TB model computes out to over $100 in savings off the regular $360 price. And the 1TB version is available for $87, down from $129. See SanDisk 4TB SSD at Amazon See SanDisk 2TB SSD at Amazon See SanDisk 1TB SSD at Amazon External hard drives do not come more portable than the SanDisk Extreme which is just 4 x 2 inches and less than a half inch thick, with a feathery weight of just 0.1 pounds. It\u2019s abundantly pocket-sized, slips easily into a small compartment of a briefcase or backpack, and it has a built-in carabiner loop in case you want to attach it to a belt loop or the outside of a bag for quick access. The SanDisk Extreme has been one of the top go-to storage solutions for professional photographers and videographers for years, and the updated Gen 2 model makes it even more attractive to creative professionals on the go with upgraded IP65 water and dust resistance, and a 3-meter drop protection rating that\u2019s a full meter greater than the Gen 1 SanDisk Extreme. Even if the only adventures you have planned for your SanDisk Extreme will be taking place inside the comfort of your home and at your computer desk, it\u2019s one of the best tools on the market for backing up data on laptops, PCs, and tablets. The SanDisk Extreme has long been known for its reactivity \u2014 1050MB\/s read and 1000MB\/s write speeds \u2014 and its reliability. It\u2019s received over 75,000 Amazon ratings with an average of 4.6 out of 5 stars based on its combination of small size, large capacity, durability, and performance. That data you add to the SanDisk Extreme is safe not just from accidental drops or water exposure, but also from prying eyes, as SanDisk has built 256-bit AES hardware encryption into the Extreme, with built-in password security. It\u2019s time to get your digital devices cleaned up and organized, and if you\u2019re still working with an older, heavier, or less-reliable backup drive, Amazon\u2019s sale taking over 30% off the price of the SanDisk Extreme 2TB and 4TB models is an upgrade well worth making.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"     Here are the top six questions I'm getting from homebuyers right now.    Economic uncertainty seems to be the only certainty these days. A barrage of\u00a0tariffs\u00a0threatens higher prices and a trade war, while\u00a0a plunging stock market\u00a0and federal job slashing\u00a0seem to be clear recession indicators. With mortgage rates inching lower, it's common for homebuyers to ask if housing will become more affordable in a downturn.\u00a0 After more than 20 years in real estate, I've seen my share of market fluctuations, from boom times to full-blown crashes, like 2008. The truth is there's always an opportunity\u00a0for certain homebuyers, regardless of how messy the economy is. The market doesn't stop during a recession. It just shifts. If you're financially ready, that shift can actually work in your favor. Let's look at what a recession really means for\u00a0mortgage rates, whether home prices will fall and when it's a good time to\u00a0buy a home.\u00a0 There are many recession warning signs right now. Layoffs are picking up, GDP is slowing and consumer confidence has dipped. Paychecks aren't going as far, and retirement accounts are taking hits.\u00a0 While less disposable income and tighter budgets point to a general slowdown in the economy, technically, we're not in a recession yet. It would take two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth to hit that definition. But for a lot of folks, it already feels like one.\u00a0 Even if the inflation rate isn't going up, the cost of everyday goods and services is still high, and budgets are getting hammered. When folks feel the squeeze every time they swipe a card at the grocery store, it shapes how they think about making huge purchases like a home. Borrowing costs have been expensive for the last several years, making households and businesses wary about taking out loans. The Federal Reserve will probably cut interest rates again later this year, eventually making financing cheaper.\u00a0 But those cuts likely won't come until summer. The Fed's a bit stuck right now. The economy's losing steam and inflation is cooling, but not fast enough. The central bank is being cautious about shifting policy, especially with tariffs driving prices back up. Though lower interest rates will eventually impact the housing market, the Fed doesn't directly control mortgage rates. Mortgage rates move based on many factors, such as the bond market and investor expectations. Even when the Fed starts cutting rates again, don't expect mortgage rates to drop like crazy. Many of those expected cuts are already priced into the market.\u00a0 Mortgage rates often fall during an economic depression, as we saw recently in 2020 and earlier in 2008. Lower rates help boost the economy, and the Fed knows that. But this time around, things are messier. There's volatility everywhere. Even though rates could drop, they might also shoot back up with any good economic news. Like many experts in the real estate industry, I think average rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage will hover between 6.5% to 7.25% for most of 2025, with weekly jumps and dips in that range.\u00a0 If you're holding out for 4% or 5% mortgage rates, you may be waiting longer than you'd like. It's going to take far more negative economic news to see rates fall significantly. It's also worth pointing out that your personal financial situation matters more than your interest rate. If you've got a solid stream of income and a long-term plan for paying off a home loan, waiting for a perfect rate might not be worth it. After years of steady growth, home prices could hypothetically crash if the bubble bursts. But in today's housing market, real estate prices won't likely go down in a big way. Historically, home prices don't actually fall much during recessions. The 2008 housing crash was the exception, not the rule. What we'll probably see is slower appreciation or small dips in certain markets, especially in areas hit by higher insurance costs, taxes or natural disasters (Florida, Texas and Louisiana come to mind). We could see home prices drop in some areas of the country as supply goes up.\u00a0 But nationwide, we're still dealing with low inventory. Until that changes, it's hard to see prices dropping dramatically. Plus, given high construction and labor costs, it's clear home prices aren't bottoming out anytime soon. If you're financially stable, it could be cheaper to buy a home in a recession. You might find better deals, less competition and more negotiating power. But if lending tightens, getting a loan could get tougher. That's something we're already starting to see with condos and certain types of properties. There's also the \"wealth effect.\" When people feel wealthier, like when their stock portfolio or home value is up, they're more confident making big purchases. But when those numbers start to slide, or there's even a threat of job insecurity, even if nothing's really changed day to day, people pull back. Economic turbulence affects buyer activity in a big way. If someone just lost $20,000 in their 401(k), they're not rushing to get a new mortgage. The best time to buy a home is when it makes sense for you. If you've got a steady income and strong credit, and you're ready to settle down, an economic downturn in the housing market could actually work in your favor.\u00a0 Just don't wait around for some magical \"perfect time\" to take out a mortgage. The green light most people are waiting for doesn't exist. If you prepare, stay informed and work with the right team, you can make a smart move no matter what the economy is doing.","label":0}

Reviews ethics statement      You only have a few more hours to grab these 4K Blu-ray deals during Amazon's Big Spring Sale.    Streaming services are the default choice for watching movies these days, since it can make picking and watching a movie much faster. However, owning physical copies of your favorite movies and shows still has its advantages, especially if you value quality and longevity. If you have a 4K TV, you'll want content that takes advantage of that resolution, and not all streaming platforms deliver that. Plus, most of the time quality is compressed, so you aren't really getting the experience you deserve. That's where 4K Blu-rays come in, delivering the best picture and sound quality available for you to keep. Amazon's Big Spring Sale event ends today. That means this is your last chance to score a ton of 4K Blu-rays for $13 or less on Amazon. There are dozens of titles on sale right now, so you're bound to find something you'll love. And with these super low prices, it's a great time to stock up on your favorites if you don't already have them. Since these 4K Blu-rays are physical discs that you'll buy, you also won't have to worry about no longer being able to access them at some point in the future, unless your Blu-ray player (like a PlayStation 5) breaks down. And again, with 4K Blu-ray quality, you're getting the absolute best picture possible, even possibly beating the quality you'd get from streaming. Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money. Many of my favorites that are currently on sale. I'm a big Disney fan, so there are plenty of classic Disney animated films on the list, like The Lion King, The Little Mermaid, Lightyear, Toy Story 4 and plenty more. Even if you're not a Disney person but like animated films, the How to Train Your Dragon trilogy is also one of my favorites. And there are a ton of live-action films on sale, too. Here's a list of some of my favorites that you can grab at a steep discount during the Amazon Big Spring Sale. These are just a few of the dozens of 4K and Blu-ray titles that you can find on Amazon right now for the Big Spring Sale. Make sure to peruse the full list to find anything that may suit your fancy. Keep in mind there are also a lot of DVDs thrown into the mix, so be sure to check that it's the format you want first. Though streaming has exploded in popularity, it seems we now have too many streaming services and it's harder to find the content you want to watch on the services you subscribe to. Not everyone wants to subscribe to every single streaming service (it's just cable all over again), and it's a pain when the content you want is no longer available on a particular service. That's why buying physical media is getting popular again, and Amazon's Big Spring Sale lets you stock up on 4K Blu-rays.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"The era of playing a game off a disc might basically be over. by  Jay Peters One of Sony\u2019s best-ever PlayStation ads is a 21-second video titled, \u201cOfficial PlayStation Used Game Instructional Video.\u201d It\u2019s a \u201cstep-by-step\u201d guide about how to lend your PS4 games to your friends. It has one step: one person hands another person a game box. The ad succinctly clowns on Microsoft\u2019s original and convoluted game sharing policy for the Xbox One, which let users ditch discs in exchange for daily DRM checks. The idea was so hated that Microsoft walked it back just over a week after the release of Sony\u2019s ad and months before the console came out. The lesson was simple \u2014 don\u2019t mess with people\u2019s discs. But more than a decade later, it\u2019s not hard to imagine a future where Sony\u2019s own ad doesn\u2019t apply anymore.  Physical game sales in 2024 were less than half what they were as recently as 2021, and the market has been in decline since 2008, Circana analyst Mat Piscatella tells The Verge. \u201cThere has been a long trend of declining sales in physical games,\u201d Piscatella says. \u201cAnd now there\u2019s declining distribution with retailers pulling back space, with companies making fewer physical games overall, and with the entire shift towards digital distribution.\u201d The writing has been on the wall since 2020, when Microsoft and Sony introduced their (at the time) next-generation Xbox and PlayStation consoles with versions that didn\u2019t have a place to put your discs. Ultimately, they were responding to the emerging trend of people buying fewer physical games for consoles. Can you even remember the last time you bought a physical game for PC? The primary reason for the shift to digital is because of connectivity: about 99 percent of consoles are connected to the internet, Piscatella says. (Players weren\u2019t quite as online a decade ago.) And once people got used to digital, \u201cmore and more often people would choose convenience over the practical positives of physical.\u201d Just look at this graph from Piscatella showing plummeting physical sales. The outlook is grim. Microsoft hasn\u2019t been particularly secretive about its interest in a heavily digital future. The latest Xbox generation launched with the all-digital Series S, and it added an all-digital Series X option last year. Microsoft\u2019s \u201cThis is an Xbox\u201d campaign positions basically every device with a screen as a potential console. The company\u2019s Xbox Game Pass subscription is essentially a rental service for digital titles. And physical editions of Avowed, one of Microsoft\u2019s biggest Xbox games of the year, only have a code for the game in the box. Of course, Microsoft is best known as a software company, so perhaps it\u2019s not too surprising that it might want to bank its video game future entirely on digital games. And while I still think it will be a shame if the next Halo isn\u2019t available on a disc, it doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable to expect that Xbox could drop discs entirely by the end of the decade. Sony will probably take a little bit longer to make the all-digital jump. The company is certainly signaling it wants to move in that direction, perhaps most strongly by shipping the premium $699 PS5 Pro without a disc drive. But it continues to sell drives separately for the Pro and for the slim PS5. And the company would simply face pushback on a different scale than Microsoft: there are far more PS4s and PS5s out there than Xboxes, and that means a lot more people who have bought a lot more physical games who may want ways to play them for the foreseeable future.  Piscatella also points out that some major mass-market games like EA Sports College Football and Call of Duty have a \u201cpretty big physical presence\u201d that console makers may not want to jeopardize. Nintendo is where we see the argument for physical games \u2014 though maybe not discs \u2014 sticking around. The just-announced Switch 2 has a cartridge slot and is backward-compatible with Switch 1 games. The console\u2019s first generation lasted from 2017 until sometime this year, so if the Switch 2\u2019s lifecycle also lasts eight years, physical media will be relevant for Nintendo well into the 2030s. The company may have reason to stick with cartridges for even longer. Piscatella says that Nintendo platforms are still \u201cheavier physical\u201d than other platforms because its audience, especially families, expects the format; it\u2019s a lot easier for kids in a family to share a game when they can just pass the cart to each other, as Sony adeptly showed in its ad. That advantage won\u2019t last forever, though. Just last week, Nintendo announced a \u201cvirtual game card\u201d lending system that lets family members share digital games. \u201cConsumers on PlayStation and Xbox are speaking with their dollars\u201d It\u2019s yet another sign that physical media is waning, even in its strongholds. \u201cAt this point, the consumers on PlayStation and Xbox are speaking with their dollars that digital-first is a fine way to go,\u201d Piscatella says. Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox did not respond to requests for comment on their future plans for physical media. While physical media sales are on the decline, New York University games professor Joost van Dreunen points out that the sales of physical video game accessories have been \u201cskyrocketing.\u201d The PC games market may be mostly digital on Steam, but sales of things like custom controllers, screens, chairs, and headphones are a \u201chuge category,\u201d he says. He believes that accessories and what he calls \u201cthe personalization of the physical experience of games and interactivity\u201d will grow, which we can see manifested all the way to theme parks. (van Dreunen points out that Nintendo is particularly good at this: think Amiibo, the Alarmo clock, and theme parks filled with Nintendo goodies.) Both van Dreunen and Piscatella ultimately made the comparison of video games to vinyl records, which is \u201ckind of like on the extreme niche, but doing ok,\u201d Piscatella says. There\u2019s a key difference between vinyl and video games, of course \u2014 with a vinyl record, you can play it on a turntable, but a physical cart of Super Mario Odyssey can only slot into a Nintendo Switch. It\u2019s more about the enthusiast crowd focusing on physical media. Maybe that will be enough to keep physical formats around into the future. But the next time Sony makes a guide on how to share PlayStation games, I doubt it will be a crisp 21 seconds.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"The company is as popular as it has ever been \u2014 and it owes it to leaving the technological arms race behind. The company is as popular as it has ever been \u2014 and it owes it to leaving the technological arms race behind. by  Andrew Webster The official unveiling of the Switch 2 was an incredibly confident moment for Nintendo. It was brief and lacking almost entirely in details. There was no price, no release date, and no confirmed games outside of a Mario Kart tease. The 2 in the name implied a bigger and better Switch, but when it came to the how \u2014 the chips that will power the device, the screen that will make Zelda and Mario look great \u2014 Nintendo deemed it wasn\u2019t important enough to share right away. And it\u2019s right: unlike the rest of the industry, Nintendo has carved out a path where specs no longer matter. It wasn\u2019t always this way. Previous Nintendo consoles were sold, as their contemporaries were, on horsepower. The Super Nintendo was a more-powerful NES, while the N64\u2019s processor was deemed so important that the system was named after it. But things started to change around the time of the GameCube. Nintendo had experienced a steady decline in console sales over subsequent generations; while the NES and Famicom sold more than 60 million units, that was down to just over 20 million for the GameCube. At the same time, Nintendo\u2019s direct competition had changed significantly. After getting a taste of going up against Sony during the N64 era, Nintendo was now up against a second tech behemoth in Microsoft. Competing on technological prowess no longer made much sense. Something had to change \u2014 and that change came in the form of the Wii. Once infamously described as \u201ctwo GameCubes and some duct tape,\u201d the Wii wasn\u2019t a major advancement over its predecessor in terms of how games looked or ran. While the Xbox 360 touted blockbusters like Halo 3, and the PS3 was showing off next-gen visuals through Resistance and MotorStorm, the Wii was defined by Wii Sports, in which characters looked like eggs and didn\u2019t even have arms. And yet, the game, which was bundled with the console everywhere but Japan, went on to become one of the best-selling games of all time because of how it played, rather than how it looked. This shift came because of what Nintendo called its \u201cblue ocean\u201d strategy. The idea was that the increasing technological complexity of games was actually making them less appealing to many consumers. We\u2019d come a long way from the simplicity of making Mario run and jump in the original Super Mario Bros. Just looking at a GameCube controller could be overwhelming for many. As former Nintendo of America president Reggile Fils-Aime wrote in 2007, \u201cWhile ardent players reliably responded to ever-advancing technology and complexity, those same attributes consistently chipped off potential new players from the total market, narrowing the consumers into a smaller niche.\u201d This meant the best path forward for Nintendo was to get out of the technological arms race and find a way to broaden the market. For the Wii, that was a console with specs that were mostly good enough to run modern 3D games, but where the focus was on its motion-sensitive controller that made games more intuitive to play, like with Wii Sports. This was followed by the Nintendo DS, a handheld that introduced touchscreen controls before smartphones were ubiquitous. Both were massive hits: the Wii sold more than 100 million units, while the DS topped 150 million. And both proved that specs are a minor concern \u2014 if they\u2019re a concern at all \u2014 to most consumers, as they surpassed more powerful competitors in terms of sales. (Sorry, Vita.) Finding the right direction for a console isn\u2019t always easy, as evidenced by the Wii U, which was a failed early attempt to merge the worlds of home consoles and portable gaming. But by shifting away from specs and graphics to focus on player experience, Nintendo has not only carved out a space for itself, but it is arguably as successful as it has ever been at a time when the video game industry is struggling on many fronts. The Switch is a pure expression of this philosophy. It\u2019s an underpowered tablet that doubles as a home console, and despite going up against beefy PlayStations, Xboxes, and a burgeoning field of portable PCs, it\u2019s on track to become Nintendo\u2019s best-selling piece of hardware ever (and it might even surpass the record set by the PS2). Its modest technical chops are overshadowed by a straightforward premise \u2014 you can take games with you anywhere \u2014 while also allowing Nintendo to develop lots of games in a more sustainable way than its competitors, who are struggling with the massive increasing costs of live service and blockbuster games. That\u2019s why Nintendo didn\u2019t utter a single spec when revealing the Switch 2 \u2014 because they\u2019re not the point. Whatever powers the company\u2019s next device has will be mostly good enough for the next open-world Zelda, but the specs don\u2019t need to be detailed in a lengthy video that uses words like upscaling and teraflops. Those details are coming, of course, but they\u2019re secondary to the core idea: this will be just like your old Switch, only better. You don\u2019t need specs to get that across.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"Our wellness advice is expert-vetted. Our top picks are based on our editors\u2019 independent research, analysis, and hands-on testing. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement      If you're overwhelmed by the countless protein bars out there, we asked dietitians to help narrow down which are the best.    Even though many people already get all the protein they need every day, having on-the-go snacks such as protein bars can be helpful when you're in a pinch. However, it's not just Quest or Powerbars anymore. With so many protein bars on store shelves, finding the best one for your tastes and preferences can be difficult and overwhelming.  To help narrow down the selection, I consulted dietitians and other experts to determine exactly what to look for when shopping for the best protein bar. They also revealed which ingredients you should avoid and which are the best if you have dietary restrictions. When you shop for protein bars, you'll see an array of choices. The options include whey- or casein-based (consisting of dairy), plant-based (which may be made up of soy, peas, seeds or nuts) and gluten-free bars. Others will specify if they're meant to be meal replacements. One of the first things you should consider when shopping for protein bars is the ingredients. \"The parts of the nutrition label I would look at right off the bat are the serving size, calories, the amount of protein and added sugars,\" said Clara Nosek, a non-diet registered dietitian. If you're unsure what to look for, our experts break down what to look for on the nutrition label.\u00a0 One of the first things to look for in a protein bar is the protein content per serving. \"Anything over 12 grams is ideal, while 20 to 25 grams is optimal,\" explained Jaclyn Sklaver, a certified nutrition specialist, dietitian and owner of Athleats Nutrition.\u00a0 You'll probably notice some protein bars with 12 grams of protein or less, which she says serves better as a snack bar. You'll also want to check where the protein is coming from. You'll find protein bars are made up of either whey, peas or soy protein.\u00a0 Another aspect of the nutrition label to keep in mind is the fiber content of the protein bar. Sammi Haber Brondo, a registered dietitian nutritionist and certified intuitive eating counselor, recommends choosing a protein bar with 5 to 10 grams of fiber per serving.\u00a0 \"While some fiber is great to help promote fullness, too much can also cause gastrointestinal distress,\" she warned.  Sklaver agrees, explaining, \"Natural sources like seeds and nuts are easier to digest, while synthetic or modified fibers can be harder on your stomach.\" So if you know your stomach can't handle too much fiber, stick with less processed options.\u00a0 The protein bar you're eyeing likely has added sweeteners in order to make it appetizing. However, the type of sweetener can make or break the product.  \"Avoid protein bars with high-fructose corn syrup and watch out for artificial sweeteners or sugar alcohols like sorbitol, which may cause digestive issues,\" said\u00a0Amelia Ti, a registered dietitian and CNET medical reviewer. Nosek cautions clients with gastric issues to be mindful of the bars marketed as \"no sugar added\" or \"low carb\" because this may indicate that they contain sugar alcohols. \"They should check to see if they are sweetened with sugar alcohols -- because sugar alcohols can cause some stomach problems when consumed in excess,\" she said.\u00a0 Rhyan Geiger, a registered dietitian and founder of Phoenix Vegan Dietitian, suggests looking at fiber, protein and sugar together. \"When shopping for a protein bar, add the amount of protein with the amount of fiber in the bar since this number should be higher than the total amount of sugar in the protein bar,\" she said.\u00a0 Ideally, the best sweetener should be made up of dried fruit or dates and free of added sugars. A good rule of thumb is to stick to ones that have fewer ingredients and are made with whole, natural ingredients. If you don't have dietary restrictions, whey-based protein bars are safe to go with: They're derived from dairy and are a complete protein. In some circumstances, you may need to be extra mindful of additional ingredients if you have dietary restrictions. If you tend to have a sensitive stomach, Sklaver recommends avoiding bars with gluten, sugar alcohols and erythritol because they can cause flare-ups.\u00a0 \"If you know you are sensitive to dairy, I would look for a plant-based bar and avoid whey protein,\" Sklaver advised. This is also why finding a protein bar with fewer and mainly all-natural ingredients is essential. Some of Slaver's favorite protein bars include:\u00a0 Those with gastric issues should avoid protein bars with gluten, dairy, sugar alcohols and emulsifiers. \"Added fiber from sources such as soluble corn fiber or inulin can also cause gas and bloating,\" Sklaver added.\u00a0 Ti advises avoiding hydrogenated oils like palm oil. \"This ingredient may raise cholesterol and increase risk for heart disease,\" she said. If you're vegan, reach for plant-based bars that blend high-quality plant proteins and other whole-food ingredients like dates or oats. For those who are gluten-free, Ti added, \"I would recommend choosing protein bars that are certified gluten-free and do not include wheat, barley or rye.\" If you're an athlete, you'll want something easily digestible and slightly more calorie-dense. \"You'll still want that high protein content, but a bit more carbs can help speed up recovery after tough workouts,\" said Kate Lyman, a nutrition coach at Kate Lyman Nutrition.  \"Promeal bars, which are still gluten-free and plant-based, have a ton of flavors, which means there's usually something for every palate,\" said Sklaver. If you don't mind refrigerating your protein bars, other recommendations include Perfect Bars and ERG bars. Cost: You'll want to browse protein bars in-store to understand their cost and the different flavors available. \"You may have to pay more for higher-quality ingredients but think about your budget and how much you are willing to pay per snack or meal replacement,\" said Sklaver. She recommends ordering variety packs so you can see which flavors you like best and can keep on hand.\u00a0 If you're on a tight budget, purchasing protein bars in bulk can be more cost-effective. If you're aiming to use protein bars as a meal replacement, Ti suggests sticking with bars that have a balance of all the macronutrients like protein, complex carbohydrates and healthy fats. Flavor and texture: Other things to think about include the flavor and texture of the protein bar. Some protein bars are crunchy, chewy or soft, which may determine whether you like a protein bar.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"For two years, Jeannie Dillard has saved what she can on her fixed income to replace the vehicle that was stolen from her home and found totalled a few miles away.  She looked around a used car dealership in Virginia on Thursday, peering at sticker prices with a newfound worry: blanket tariffs on foreign cars and car parts that experts warn could drive up prices in the US, which kick in next week. She'd like to buy a car now, she said, but \"I have to wait until my finances improve\". Ms Dillard is among the plethora of Americans bracing for expected economic turbulence under President Donald Trump's sweeping auto tariffs - an unprecedented US trade policy manoeuvre.  \"It took me a long time to save up for the last car,\" she said. \"If prices get too high, I'm obviously not going to buy something that I can't afford.\"  She added: \"We'll just have to wait and see.\" On Wednesday, Trump announced new import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts entering the US from overseas, which go into effect on 2 April. Charges on businesses importing vehicles are expected on 3 April, and taxes on parts are set to start in May or later. Trump and members of his administration have argued that the tariffs will lead to \"tremendous growth\" and increase jobs in the US. But experts and automakers have warned in dire terms that tariffs could raise prices for US consumers, amplifying the stress of an already sluggish economy. Mohamad Husseini, co-owner of a used car dealership in Maryland, said that he expects the additional tariff costs to get passed on to the consumer.  \"The prices in the wholesale market have skyrocketed already,\" he told the BBC.  \"It's going to get worse.\"  A car that would sell for $13,000 (\u00a310,000) might rise to $14,500 (\u00a311,200) because of the tariffs, Mr Husseini said. He predicted that consumers will see prices increase in the next three to six weeks. The auto tariffs will likely force car dealers like Mr Husseini to raise prices. \"We all still have bills to pay, mouths to feed and employees to pay,\" he said. At another car dealership, Robin Sloan was hoping to get a deal before prices increased. She said she probably would have waited until the summer to go car shopping, but \"with the tariffs, I decided I should go out and look now\".  She rejected the Trump administration's claim that tariffs will cause Americans to buy US cars instead of foreign ones.  \"I don't think I would buy a car made in the United States just because of the tariffs, I think I would probably wait a few years until things settle down,\" Ms Sloan said. From buyers to dealers, the effects of the tariffs will be widespread, for better or for worse, experts say.  In the US, there are 908 motor vehicles per 1,000 people. About 92% of households own a vehicle. Car ownership is typically higher in the US than in Europe, surveys suggest, partly because, in the absence of extensive public transport, many Americans have no other choice of how to get around. Cars are also more than just a means of transportation. As symbols of both freedom and success, cars have a unique place in the national identity, from the show Pimp My Ride to Janice Joplin singing \"Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz\". John Heitmann, a University of Dayton professor and automobile historian, who in his free time likes to polish his 1982 Mercedes SL, said that tariffs will have an existential, as well as an economic, impact. \"New cars are really out of the reach of a good number of Americans to begin with,\" he told the BBC.  \"Consumers will not benefit, prices will go up,\" particularly amongst more affordable vehicles made in Korea, like Hyundais, he said. As a vintage-car enthusiast, he said tariffs have added a layer of uncertainty to his hobby. \"About 50 minutes ago, I got an email from a part supplier in the UK saying, 'Don't worry... they're not going to go up, probably',\" he said. \"'We haven't seen anything in writing yet.' That's what they said.\" Higher-end imported vehicles, such as Audis, BMWs and Mercedes, will increase in price, too, Prof Heitmann said, though many of those who buy from such brands might be able to absorb a heftier price tag. A 2024 study by the US International Trade Commission predicted that a 25% tariff on imports would reduce imports by almost 75%, while increasing average prices in the US by about 5%. The US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade and roughly half of overall sales.  Despite efforts from some car makers - including Ford and General Motors - to discourage Trump enacting auto tariffs, the president is forging ahead.  Some car makers are embracing Trump's tariffs, however. On Tuesday, Hyundai, the South Korean car-marker, announced it would invest $21bn (\u00a316.3bn) in the US by building a new steel plant in Louisiana.  Trump said the move is a \"clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work\". But the tariffs are likely to impact the domestic car industry as well.  US auto manufacturing has been deeply intertwined with industries in Canada and Mexico for decades. Parts criss-cross the borders several times before they are assembled, which means that even a vehicle as iconically American as a Ford pickup truck could see a sticker price increase.  Ultimately, Trump's tariff strategy will thrust the US auto industry into uncharted territory, leaving uncertainty hanging over consumers, dealers and automakers until they go into effect on Wednesday. \"Everything's topsy turvy now, you know, and it's also terribly filled with uncertainty, because no one exactly knows what kind of game is really being played by the Trump administration related to all the bluster of these tariffs,\" Prof Heitmann said. Some, like Mya Fountain-Bunch, just want to get through the unease. She took her car into a dealership this week to avoid needing a replacement after the tariffs hit.  \"[I'm] making sure that my car is working and hopefully I won't have to buy another car in the next few years, or at least the next four years until this administration is done with.\"  Additional reporting by Meiying Wu Critically endangered Galapagos tortoises Abrazzo and Mommy are parents of four hatchlings at Philadelphia Zoo High winds and heavy rain were expected to continue into Sunday, delaying clean-up efforts.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"Business Insider Edition  Switching jobs was once a surefire way to get a big raise, but federal data suggest that's no longer the case.          According to the Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker, the median pay increase for job switchers fell to 4.2% in February, a sharp decline from 7.3% in early 2023.               Job stayers also saw wage growth slow, though to a lesser extent, declining from 5.8% to 4.4% over the same period.               This marks a stark shift from the labor market immediately post-pandemic, when job switchers consistently outpaced job stayers in pay gains. At their peak in July 2022, job switchers earned as much as 2.6% more than those who stayed put.               Labor market analysts attribute the wage downturn to the cooling of the Great Resignation \u2014 the post-pandemic wave of record job quits and a labor shortage that drove up wages.               In 2021 alone, about 47 million Americans left their jobs, often securing higher pay elsewhere.               \"Job switchers enjoyed a significant wage premium from late 2021 through early 2023 because employers were facing significant labor shortages after the pandemic and needed to offer significant wage increases to lure workers away from their prior positions,\" Nancy Vanden Houten,Oxford Economics' US Lead Economist, told Business Insider.               Now, however, slowing inflation, fewer job offers, and reduced competition for workers have weakened employees' bargaining power.               \"Labor markets are still fairly strong, but nowhere near as tight as in 2022,\" Harry Holzer, a nonresident senior fellow in economic studies at Brookings and a public policy professor at Georgetown University, told BI.               \"The really large gains in 2022 were occurring during the Great Resignation when the labor market was extremely tight, and workers demanded higher pay,\" he said. But now, \"quits have gone way down.\"               This shift is making many workers reluctant to leave their current jobs.               \"Certainly, in DC, there's this feeling that you're better off staying put in a way right now with all the layoffs,\" Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, told BI.               \"There's some economic insecurity that would be leading to this kind of phenomenon where people might be just staying still more,\" she said.               Tech professionals, in particular, are feeling the effect of a cooling job market.               Jim Harrington, a principal software engineer at Cart.com who earns over $200,000 a year, told BI that during his 12-month job search, he has seen wages on job listings top out at $180,000.               \"It's not a bad wage, but it is not the levels that we were accustomed to seeing over the last few years,\" he said.               According to Levels.fyi data, wages for software engineers, product designers, and technical program managers fell 1-2% in the second half of 2024.               Some professionals have even left the industry altogether.               Ryan Essenburg, who said he worked for 21 years as a Business Development Directorat SimulTrans, a translation and localization services company in Mountain View, California, told BI he saw his position eliminated in April 2024.               After what he termed an \"existential\" job search and lower salary offers, \"I decided to put my search on indefinite hold,\" he said, adding: \"I am coaching tennis now and very happy.\"               Others have had to take significant pay cuts.               Raymond Traylor, who was laid off as PairTree's Chief Technology Officer in December 2023, went from a $180,000 salary to $36,000 as a computer systems analyst at VSorts, a SaaS platform, from December 2023 to March 2023, and has been earning between $3,000 and $5,000 a month as Negotiate Fairly's CTO and cofounder since March 2024.               \"It's been a multi-year downturn, but hopefully it's not too much longer, and I hope that we don't go back to just a boom-and-bust bubble sort of economy,\" he told BI, adding he hopes it's just an \"in-between weird time.\"               While job stayers saw slightly higher pay raises than job switchers in February, their long-term prospects aren't much better.               Workplace advisory firm Willis Towers Watson projects that US employees who stay in their roles will see an average 3.7% salary increase in 2025, down from 3.8% in 2024 and\u00a04.6%\u00a0in 2023, though still above the pre-pandemic norm of 3%.               Some economists warn this isn't just a temporary dip.               \"The amount of uncertainty facing businesses today is leading to further reluctance to hire,\" Thomas A. Kochanco, co-director of the MIT Institute for Work and Employment Research, told BI.               \"If anything, the labor market will get weaker in the months ahead.\"               \"I hope we are not in for a recession,\" he added. \"But if that does occur, expect the bargaining power of both job hoppers and incumbents to continue to decline.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"Business Insider Edition  Actors should think like investors and make sure to spread their bets, Anthony Mackie says.          The \"Captain America: Brave New World\" star recently told \"The Pivot\" podcast he's seen many of his peers get \"hot\" and land a bunch of leading roles, only for their careers to flatline a few years later.               \"It's like, yo, you have no staying power,\" Mackie said, \"because you're not diversifying your portfolio. If all you're investing in is Walmart, and Walmart has a bad week, you're fucked. So you've got to be able to do all the other shit, and that's what I always tell young actors.\"               Investors typically buy multiple assets to avoid betting the farm on a single horse. They might offset the risk of holding stocks by owning bonds too, and within a stock portfolio, they might balance the higher volatility of a growth stock like Tesla with the stability of a more staid name like Walmart.               Mackie repeated his point when asked how to achieve longevity in an entertainment career. \"By diversifying your portfolio,\" he said, adding that now he's in his mid-40s, he's eager to do more producing and curate his own experiences for moviegoers.               \"Tyler Perry has shown us the mold,\" Mackie said, adding that the billionaire filmmaker behind the \"Madea\" franchise has \"created the wheel, so it don't make sense for me to get a chisel and try to make another one.\"               Perry's income streams include his Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, along with other investments.                Mackie \u2014 known for portraying the superhero Falcon in past Marvel movies and his roles in \"The Hurt Locker\" and \"8 Mile\" \u2014 said athletes have been parlaying their fame into owning car dealerships, barbecue joints, and other businesses for decades.        George Foreman, who died earlier this month, made way more money from his grills than from his boxing career.                Mackie also echoed Warren Buffett's famous advice to find a job you're passionate about. The legendary investor has often said he enjoys being Berkshire Hathaway's CEO so much that he tap dances to work.               Similarly, Mackie said that \"if you love it, you never work a day in your life.\"               The actor also spoke about ensuring his four sons remain grounded despite his success. \"I keep my boys humble,\" he said, adding they've \"never had a pair of Jordans.\"               Mackie said they \"don't do all that internet fly shit,\" and the message he sends them is: \"I could be the biggest star in the world, do not let me catch you being stupid.\"       Ben Affleck, another actor who's played multiple superheroes, recently said that he frequently gives his teenage son a reality check.               \"There's always some grift why I need to be buying,\" the \"Daredevil\" and \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\" star said about his son's taste for luxury goods. \"I'm like, bruh, you do not need $1,000 shoes.

I am looking forward to someone who will build the equivalent of a  1971 Ford F150 pickup with the bare minimum extras needed to make it meet Federal and state regulations.  The truck being built with as few computers as possible, pounds of less copper, mechanical instrument dials, AC, mechanical windows \/ door locks, and power steering \/ power brakes.

The idea is to trade all the tens of thousands spent on computers, seat warmers, subscription based touchscreen panel services, etc. and spend them on making the mechanical part of the truck more reliable and long lived.

You do save quite a bit of money, and 90% of the time, (if you do your due diligence) it\u2019ll be in decent condition. For the risk-averse, non-mechanically inclined, I don\u2019t really advise it. If you have realistic expectations for a $2000 vehicle, you\u2019ll be very happy. Keep in mind that you should expect to spend an additional $700 once it\u2019s here, not including costs to get it from the port to your house. Import duty will be 25% of the purchase price (NOT purchase and shipping), so about $250. Port\/wharfage fees will be $176. ISF filing is $25. If you use a customs broker, they\u2019ll charge around $200. If the port you go to requires a TWIC escort, that\u2019s about $100. Parts availability isn\u2019t really an issue. Lots of basic stuff is at your auto parts store.

Except, you know, they designed and built them before Elon got political, and the CyberTruck get no additional or increased subsidies compared to other EVs, but sure, we'll all just smile and nod as you try and force your Musk\/Tesla derangement syndrome into a thread that has nothing to do with either Tesla OR Musk. On my way into work last week, one of these trucks, in that blue color, was parked outside a Monroe Muffler place.  Thought it looked cute.  The road has a 35 mph speed limit, but the usual speed is 40 or a bit more. \"Land of the free\"? Hah! Get those lazy cops arresting pedestrians and deporting them to El Salvador. That'll teach them to get longer legs and learn to drive before puberty. Arresting pedestrians? Where? Oh, do you mean pedestrians that entered the country illegally, commit violent\/serious crimes, and have exhausted all possible amnesty claims in immigration court? Those pedestrians? They get taken out of the streets in Europe, if they tune the speed limited to higher speeds. It is relatively trivial to remove the speed limiter on most ebike, especially one Chinese brands. If cops in Paris see you going over 25kph, especially without pedaling then they will likely take the bike away. Now these are common on the Tour de France, yet they let the riders do it, pretending to not notice anything. They tell the teams ahead of time to get the bikes ready for inspection, just like they did with  There's the thing. Road safety says these things are unsafe so we should ban them. No word about the multi ton small penis compensators many Americans drive around. Maybe the unsafe thing is being surrounded by American cars, especially when you look at the road fatality rate in the USA compared to Japan where these things are common. In Japan you can not buy a car with proof you have a parking space for it - that kinda cuts down on car ownership\/influences the makeup of the population that own cars in Japan. The only solution I can see if that vehicles over a certain size have to replace the airbags with spikes that stab you in the face in the event of an accident. Otherwise the arms race to own ever bigger cars will go on forever. Bigger cars are safer for their occupants, smaller cars are at increased risks when involved in accidents with bigger cars. It's not my fault you chose to drive on the highway in a motorized coffin. They are quite useful around the local orchards, and cheaper than a utility vehicle. Japan is a lot more densely urbanized than the USA, so a truck like this makes sense. Also, the Japanese are more acclimated high density living (smaller roads, smaller homes (A US home is twice as big as a typical Japanese home, and they have tighter parking availability). Plus, the Japanese on average are a couple inches shorter and weigh less, they are OK with a little less space. Because automobiles are dangerous and your choices don't just affect you.   Drive whatever you want on your freedom compound, just keep your deathtrap off public roads.A vehicle like this is significantly less dangerous for othe vehicles than any normal-sized truck or even your average EV due to it having so little mass. From a quick Google search, a Kei pickup is about 800Kg\/1750lbs, a Kei minivan is about 1000Kg\/2200lbs. A normal truck or an EV can be easily double that.Against a person of course it can be just as deadly, but I don't see why it would be more dangerous and banned compared to e.g. a Ford F150...

While overall vehicle impact energy may be lower, there's less stopping distance when the vehicle is small as in the distance for the front of the vehicle to collapse and also the amount of energy the vehicle would absorb without passing it to the passenger. Reference: https:\/\/www.iihs.org\/topics\/ve... [iihs.org] Not only that, but that\u2019s the entire mindset thing here: US vehicles are somewhat safer for occupants at the expense of all other road users, while non-US vehicles like Kei cars are somewhat less safe for occupants, but massively safer for all other road users. It\u2019s a textbook example of American prioritisation of the self over others. You are wrong on multiple levels:1. Not all other road users are in cars. Pedestrians, cyclists etc \u2014 all of whom are especially important in the most common settings for Kei vehicles, which are urban. But the absence of these people from your thinking speaks volumes about the car-centric culture of the US.2. KE = 1\/2 mv squared. If two Kei vans collide, they are *not* just as dangerous for the occupants as two trucks colliding, because the Kei cars are lighter and slower, leading to much lower levels of kinetic energy to be dissipated3. Kei vans have inherently better visibility than trucks, because there\u2019s no giant hood obscuring your view of the road ahead. So they will be involved in fewer accidents. This is but one of the ways they are engineered to meet pedestrian safety regulations, while US trucks are not engineered to meet any US pedestrian safety regulations, because those regulations don\u2019t exist4. Kei vans\u2019 design is inherently supportive of driving calmly and defensively, by comparison with trucks. No massive bull bars, giant tyres, etc. Drivers are on average going to be less amped up in Kei vans than in trucks, once again leading to fewer collisions etc. Ye gods, did you really try to argue that two heavy things striking causes less harm to the things than two light things striking? Jesus fucking Christ on a very light bike. You are an absolute dimwit. This is so absurdly wrong it\u2019s quite incredible to see. You witter on about mass fractions but are incapable of thinking through the most basic physics. You\u2019re a complete buffoon. I mean, really, one of the most stupid people I\u2019ve ever come across, and it really is something because you think you\u2019re clever, but you can\u2019t even understand that when two heavy things smack into each other, it causes more damage than when two light things smack into each other. What a complete cock you are. There are dog turds in the street with more ability to reason than you. \u201cStudy after study\u201d, what a load of shite you spout. Study after study shows the blindingly obvious truth, that increasing vehicle size (both mass and height, especially hood height), causes increasing harms to pedestrians and cyclists. You are a contemptible prick for arguing there\u2019s no link, as well as being stupid and ill-informed. It\u2019s almost impossible for me to put into words the contempt I feel for people like you, arguing that black is white and thinking you\u2019re clever when you\u2019re so fucking dumb. Here\u2019s just a few of the many examples of the studies showing the link exists, and that getting rammed by a giant truck at 30mph when you\u2019re on your bike is going to be a shit load more likely to seriously injure or kill you than getting rammed by a Kei van or a small car going at the same speed. https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/...

[iihs.org] \u201c Fatal pedestrian and pedalcyclist crashes have been on the rise in the United States since 2009. This rise in fatalities coincides with the rise of large vehicles on American roadways, continuing a trend that began years earlier. Method: Through rare access to both crash and hospital records, this report investigates the relationship between striking vehicle type and medical outcomes of pedestrian and pedalcyclist cases. Results: Results suggest that children are eight times more likely to die when struck by a SUV compared to those struck by a passenger car. Passenger cars were the striking vehicle in most fatal pedestrian and pedalcyclist crashes, though they were underrepresented relative to the proportion of all crashes in which they were involved. Though pickup trucks were the striking vehicle in just 5.6% of pedestrian and pedalcyclist crashes, they were involved in 12.6% of fatalities. SUVs were similarly overrepresented in fatalities relative to the proportion of their involvement in all crashes. SUVs struck 14.7% of the pedestrians and pedalcyclists investigated here, but were involved in 25.4% of the fatalities. Head and thorax injury severities are examined by vehicle type and age. Hospital charges of pedestrian and pedalcycle crash victims are also analyzed by striking vehicle type and victim age.\u201d One factor that DOES affect other road users is that headlights on right-hand-drive-market vehicles have the wrong dipped beam pattern for USA highways. I would guess that not a lot of kei trucks' parts bins have LHD headlamps available for easy swap. Pro tip: head lights can, and periodically should, be manually adjusted by a professional shop. Individually. For reference that weight puts these cars as *HEAVIER* than many European city cars. The wife's car is 790kg, and has a 4 star NCAP safety rating for the occupant in crash tests. So maybe if these cars are so unsafe the problem isn't the size or weight, but potentially what they are surrounded by? The road fatalities per mile driven and per vehicle registered in the USA vs Japan is quite telling too. Because automobiles are dangerous and your choices don't just affect you.   Drive whatever you want on your freedom compound, just keep your deathtrap off public roads.To be fair we let bicycles and scooters mix with cars, trucks, and buses.  Safety standards have value but they don't preclude you from taking additional, informed risk. Because automobiles are dangerous and your choices don't just affect you.   Drive whatever you want on your freedom compound, just keep your deathtrap off public roads. To be fair we let bicycles and scooters mix with cars, trucks, and buses.  Safety standards have value but they don't preclude you from taking additional, informed risk. Plus also America is notorious for having safety standards that doesn't include vehicles colliding with anything other than cars and up. This is why the Cybertruck is illegal in the UK: it's lethal to pedestrians and that's not allowed here. Japan does, which means you're not allowed to choose a vehicle that's less safe for you but safer for third parties, on the grounds of safety. but we'll pass thanks. Your roads are about 5 times more dangerous than the UK, so do your needless deaths (America! Pro life AND pro death! USA! USA! USA!) and we'll not do ours. Canada is as bad as America in regards of road safety. Do you think people should have the freedom to unload a firearm in the direction of a crowd as long as they don't happen to injure anyone? If not, why so you hate freedom? If they actually were \"deathtraps\", I might agreeThey are safely driven in many other countriesOur laws are way to restrictive. We're drowning in laws and rules Those kei trucks are great for urban areas though, where the density is pretty high. If you do deliveries in a downtown area, having a smaller truck is great for zipping around packed streets and fitting into small parking spaces. That's why people love them. Also, they're very efficient on gas. If you need the ability to carry a lot of stuff, but a pickup like the F-150 is too big to go around downtown, a Kei is really good because they can haul a lot more than a car, without taking much more footprint. Of course, the main reason they're illegal is not safety, it's because they're small, lightweight, great on gas, and that is not the general messaging the Big 3 want to make. Because big trucks and SUVs are way more profitable per vehicle than a smaller truck. The reason they're illegal is heavy lobbying by the car companies to make them illegal because they don't want to compete with people finding smaller trucks much more useful for going around town, especially for work trucks and such. Pickup trucks are used for work, and if you're forced to buy a $70,000 F-150 that gets 8mpg even if it's way more truck than you need, that's better for Ford than if you discover you can get a Kei car for $15,000 all in, that gets 30mpg and you can actually park it and go about your day. The Big 3 have been giving a narrative that only big vehicles will do since the late 80s, which is why there's the rise of the SUV as the family hauler over say, the station wagon. Or why SUVs over minivans. Part of the auto tariffs is because the Big 3 refuse to make smaller more efficient vehicles and that's a niche that Japanese and other foreign makes did to invade the US in the 70s. I have a 2002 Tacoma, the last year that I could still buy an actual 'small pickup', the next year's Tacoma was the size of the previous year's Tundra.  It's a five speed with the smallest four-banger they sold, and it's more truck than most people will ever need.  My dad ran his remodeling business in the '90s with a six cylinder Dakota until the body rot got so bad the doors were falling off.  He hated the 8-cylinder F-150 that replaced it. I can\u00e2(TM)t believe it hasn\u00e2(TM)t been mentioned in this thread already.  Mercedes-Benz didn\u00e2(TM)t make it illegal.    Technically, what happened, was that all vehicles were illegal, and Bill Gates wanted to import. I think a 983 or something.   And he lobby to have that 25 year clause so he could import his Porsche. Also, they're very efficient on gas. This is actually not true.  The maximum size of the engine (due to licensing requirements) is 660 cc.  And while it is true that smaller engines generally consume less fuel, this is not always the case.  One achieves more power from a given engine displacement by revving to higher RPM.  Power equals torque times RPM so if you can increase the RPM with minimal impact on torque then you will generate more power.  With a 660 cc limit you can break it into 4 cylinders with each cylinder having a relatively sho  Also, they're very efficient on gas.  This is actually not true.

They are surprisingly spacious on the inside, and the trucks are extremely practical, often having a larger bed than a Cybertruck of F-150.   https:\/\/i.redd.it\/9vxnxud2hn3b... [i.redd.it]  Being lower the beds are easier to use too. They aren't just shrunk down versions, they are extremely well engineered to make the most efficient use of space. The cars are great too, with features like sliding doors that  Kei vehicles must conform to specific requirements and are designed for use as farm or work vehicles.  It is a class of vehicles with minimal licensing \/ insurance costs.  The Japanese government does not want everyone using such vehicles, just those that require them to minimize the cost of doing business.  As such, they are very simple, very inexpensive, and kind of crappy.  Designed for rural areas - not urban.   The size limitations of the Kei vehicles are not because Japanese are smaller but is because  Kei trucks do not meet the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, or FMVSS \u00e2\" the highly specific rules US-market new cars must meet.Why must any vehicle I purchase have to meet these standards?

Mopeds and under-100cc vehicles (or more -depends on state) are explicitly exempted from requiring DMV involvement. I think the problem is they can't get to very high speed. Most of them can't hit highway speeds for example. How is that a problem? My bicycle can't hit highway speeds and fun fact, it's not legal to cycle on the highway for that reason. By the way most of these cars have a top speed of around 75mph which is more than adequate. I think the problem is they can't get to very high speed.

Doesn't mean they are there legally. They have license plates. According to Wikipedia, one can drive a microcar on public roads in USA. Currently: Commuter Cars Tango, Myers Motors NmG (or Corbin Sparrow), and the Smart Fortwo (not marketed as microcar, but similar form factor). Does not make sense to allow micro-cars and forbid micro-trucks. Most states they're perfectly legal to license and drive on public roads, although they can't get up to the minimum speed for freeways so that's not allowed. Why? This is America, things happen because someone is going to profit from it, that's why. Could there be any other reason? At the end of the day, that 25-year-old vehicle with absolutely no warranty from Japan is gonna cost you almost as much as a decent used car.  Plus, ever since the bottom fell out of used EV prices, if your goal is just getting something that's economical to drive you'd probably be better off considering a used EV instead. Realistically, the people who like these things are into the idea of owning a quirky little vehicle.  There's not a whole lot of logical practicality in paying a bunch of money to import a  Nice try, but most of these vehicles are way better than what American market vehicles get. Think 50mpg truck with an 8ft bed, hydraulic dump, air suspension, manual transmission, and four wheel drive. These compete with F-150s and F250s for light farm use. People who need the bed and not the towing or 10mpg. People who want to wrench on their own car without dealer locks. Stuff American market companies just refuse to allow or produce. These compete with F-150s and F250s for light farm use. People who need the bed and not the towing or 10mpg.Most people are using side-by-sides for this now, and some models are getting damn car-like (and cost as much).  A case could be made for road use there too.  And of course once you entertain SxS maybe I could get a Ariel Atom for street use.  That would be so cool.

And of course once you entertain SxS maybe I could get a Ariel Atom for street use.  That would be so cool. But they don't do highway speeds.  That's a non-starter here in the USA, where I've even seen people legitimately complain that the Chevy Bolt maxes out at somewhere around 93 MPH (no, I haven't tested it for myself).  Why in the hell would anyone ever need to go that fast in the first place is beyond me, but there it is. Then you've also got the situation here in the USA where people just own trucks because they're \"cool\".  The owners don't do actual truck stuff with them, so a truck that has all its stats  Texas has an 85 MPH highway.  Here in Florida, 70 MPH limits are quite common on the highways.  You drive a truck that maxes out at 60-70 MPH on one of these roads and you genuinely are creating a hazard.  Plus, there's no way the engine is going to enjoy being run wide open throttle for your whole damn trip.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"Clearer advice is needed on how to make campuses inclusive without falling foul of free speech regulations, the National Union of Students (NUS) has said. The body representing university students has expressed concern after the University of Sussex was fined \u00a3585,000 by the Office for Students (OfS) this week for failing to uphold free speech - the first case of its kind. The higher education regulator launched an investigation back in 2021 when Professor Kathleen Stock left the university. She had faced protests after saying that biological sex was more important than gender identity. According to the OfS, the university's policy statement on trans and non-binary equality, including a requirement to \"positively represent trans people\", might have led to staff and students preventing themselves from voicing opposing views. That has triggered not only the threat of a court showdown, after the university vowed to challenge the OfS's findings, but also put universities across the UK on alert over further free speech-related fines - and leaving some fearing a catch-22 situation. Universities in England are asking for clarity behind the scenes on how to protect their students from abuse and harassment because the regulator hasn't spelt out what is acceptable. The regulator told the BBC it would be writing to a handful of institutions to remind them of their duty to protect free speech. Arif Ahmed, from the OfS, warned the University of Sussex fine could have been as high as \u00a33.7m and there was \"potential for higher fines in the future\". Commenting for the first time since the fine was issued to Sussex, the NUS said it was concerned about the size of the fine at a time when university finances are under pressure. Its vice president for liberation and equality Saranya Thambirajah said it was important universities were welcoming places for all marginalised groups of students - and suggested the money could have gone towards improving student welfare instead. She told the BBC it's \"really unclear\" where the OfS is drawing the line on what is or isn't acceptable. \"We would say at the NUS, that the line between freedom of harm and freedom of speech right now is not falling in the right place, or at the very least, there is very little clarity from the regulator as to where that line should be falling,\" she said. The OfS has said it should be possible to express any lawful view on campus - but the trans and non-binary equality policy at the heart of the Sussex row, which was in place until last year, illustrates the potential challenges ahead. One of the concerns raised by the regulator was a section in the policy which said that harassment or bullying including intrusive behaviour, name calling or derogatory jokes were serious disciplinary offences. Now, the university has replaced it with a new trans and non-binary policy - but the regulator hasn't told bosses yet whether or not that passes the free-speech test. And in another potential point of tension, from 1 August a new regulation comes into force requiring universities in England to go further in showing how they will promote and uphold free speech on campus. The OfS says this shouldn't include the content of courses or discussions in the lecture hall. All higher education institutions have to meet conditions to register with the OfS in order to charge tuition fees. But they will also have to show how they are acting to prevent the harassment of students - and universities are required to try to increase applications from underrepresented groups, through initiatives to make them feel more included. Lawyer Smita Jamdar, who advises universities in England on how to comply with regulations, says that to reduce harassment, universities need to be \"really clear about the behaviour you will and will not tolerate\" and that action will be taken when students \"transgress those boundaries\". While that has to be balanced against freedom of speech, Ms Jamdar said most people would expect \"the line to be drawn somewhere other than name calling and derogatory jokes\". When the BBC looked at similar trans equality policies at a number of universities it wasn't entirely clear whether they would be considered a challenge to free speech. Of course, the implications of the Sussex fine for universities across the country straddle many other free speech debates and groups of students, including all the potential flashpoints of race, religion, ethnicity and conflict which sometimes play out on university campuses. The impacts of the Sussex fine are unlikely to go away any time soon, with vice-chancellors and students alike calling for more clarity. One of those major tests would be if University of Sussex's vice-chancellor, Prof Sasha Roseneil, gets her day in court. The university has confirmed it will seek a review by a senior judge of the inquiry. If the Sussex case gets debated in court, plenty of people on other campuses would be listening closely. Figures received via FOI requests reveal an average over 40% increase in the amount of money allocated. Up to 700 jobs at the University could be cut in a bid to tackle a \u00a335m deficit. It says \"difficult decisions\" are needed and follows moves by other universities to reduce staffing.  The EIS says an initial day of action has been set for 15 April, with more in May and September.

Even that \u201cvalue\u201d buy in 2025 is out of stock everywhere and the alternatives are even worse. And it shouldn\u2019t be rewarded. I probably shouldn\u2019t be telling you this. DigitalTrends makes good money from affiliate links, and I love new hardware as much as the next person. But graphics cards are not affordable right now, and buying them when they\u2019re at these inflated prices, paying for access to stock trackers and special groups just to give you the chance to pay more money to someone else, is a bad idea. It might work in the short term, but it\u2019s not something we want to establish for the future. Now is not the time to buy a new graphics card. There\u2019s an old adage with computer hardware that it\u2019s never the right time to upgrade, because there\u2019s always something new and shiny over the horizon. Even if you bought an RTX 5090 and a 9950X3D with all the other high-end components that make your PC as fast as it gets in 2025, it won\u2019t be long before something else comes along to supplant it. New monitors will arrive that makes yours look dull and slow, or Intel will refresh its 200 Series CPUs and make a new workhorse monster chip, or Nvidia and AMD will refresh their GPU lineups, making yours feels decidedly less-super. But this is one time where you really should wait it out. Although the march of progress will continue on, and any delay in upgrading does mean you\u2019ll have less time before something better comes along, the prices and availability this time around are that ridiculous. You really should just wait it out, if you can. If you have a new game you want to play and need a new GPU for it, I get it. But if you can delay it that bit longer to save yourself several hundred dollars\u00a0and don\u2019t reward bad business practices, that\u2019s better for you and the industry as a whole. I love to get into the back and forth rivalries in the hardware industry. Intel vs. AMD, AMD vs. Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple, it\u2019s all in good fun. It\u2019s a silly team sport about numbers going up. But at the end of the day, even the \u201cplucky\u201d underdog AMD is a company worth almost $200 billion. The CEOs are all worth hundreds of millions or billions. They might play at being the good guy, but none of them have our interests at heart. They\u2019re trying to make money, which is why the only real weight any of our concerns have, is with our money. Buying GPUs at inflated prices rewards bad behaviour. It tells these companies that you don\u2019t mind paying the crazy prices. But if cards sit on shelves for long enough, prices always come down. We\u2019ve seen it generation after generation that the cards priced badly get price cuts. All GPUs are priced badly at the moment, even AMD\u2019s new ones. Making them bring the prices down is a game of chicken that we can win if we work together. Nvidia could even start to focus more on gaming again. Nah, probably not. I completely understand the mindset of everyone for themselves, when prices and availability are this bad. If you want a new GPU and you sit outside a Micro Center for days before the launch to get it, I do understand \u2014 even if my ass would never survive sitting on concrete for more than 10 minutes. But the one thing you can do that is worse than paying over-inflated retail prices, is paying other people for the privilege of doing so. That includes paying for stock tracking apps and services, playing in lotteries, or paying for VIP access to stores. Getting to spend money on something isn\u2019t a privelege. It\u2019s a transation that should be properly honored, not gatekept behind even more financial investment. You\u2019ve gotta do what you\u2019ve gotta do, but if you can avoid rewarding the scalpers and chancers taking advantage of this situation to sell shovels in this GPU gold rush, it\u2019ll help normalise the scene once stock levels return, and make it less likely they\u2019ll come back when this happens again. You don\u2019t owe me anything and you certainly don\u2019t owe the industry anything. Your individual purchase is not going to sway anything one way or another. I (and by extension, gamers in general) would appreciate the solidarity and the help in stopping these kind of practices, if you would be willing to hold off on buying. But if you have to, I get it. Just make sure you do it the right way. My colleague Monica put together a great guide on how to buy a graphics card right now, but I\u2019ll summarise her suggestions: You can consider buying second-hand or older last-generation cards, but be careful. Prices are inflated there too, and the cards don\u2019t come with all the latest features, and may not have a warranty. There\u2019s also no guarantee a second-hand card wasn\u2019t used for cryptocurrency mining, which can shorten its lifespan. After the way Nvidia's RTX 50-series ended up being called a \"paper launch,\" many breathed a sigh of relief when AMD's RX 9000 series appeared on the shelves in much larger quantities. However, once this initial shipment is sold, AMD could face the same problem as the rest of the best graphics cards: Price hikes, price hikes everywhere. The cards officially hit the shelves yesterday, and many were spotted far above the recommended list price (MSRP), with some overclocked models priced at up to $250 more than the $600 starting price. However, AMD spoke several times about working with its partners to ensure wide availability at MSRP, and indeed, many retailers had some models up for sale. Those MSRP cards were only around for a short time, though, and they might never come back, according to retailers. I know, I know we're all hopped up about the RX 9070 XT and 9070 launch -- I know I am. But looking beyond the potential big win AMD is on for with its first RDNA4 graphics cards, I'm also particularly excited about the potential for the rumored 9060 XT. Not because it'll be cheaper again -- it will be -- but because it might have up to 16GB of VRAM. That's going to wreck Nvidia's long-term second-hand card market, which could have a much greater impact on AMD's market share over the long term. It's all just rumors for now, and some of my colleagues are much less excited by this than I am, but I think there's some real potential here for this little card to be a game changer. Hitting the VRAM wall Video memory, or VRAM, has been a front-and centre feature of graphics card spec sheets for generations, but it's started to matter a lot more in recent years. While flagship graphics cards have exploded in their VRAM quantities, with the 5090 now offering 32GB, most mainstream cards have been getting by with less. It was only a couple of generations ago that the flagship RTX 3080 only had 10GB of VRAM, and outside of the top few models, you'll still see 12GB, 10GB, or even 8GB. A new leak tells me that AMD's RX 9060 XT may repeat the same mistake as the RX 7600 XT, all the while missing out on a chance to win against rival Nvidia. While AMD's RX 9060 XT may not compete against some of the best graphics cards, it's going to be a mainstream card, which is great news for gamers. The downside, as is often the case, might lie in VRAM. As shown in this listing filed with the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC), Acer has just registered several new trademarks for its upcoming GPUs. This includes the Acer Predator Bifrost RX 9060 XT OC in two variants: One with 8GB VRAM and one with 16GB.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"Business Insider Edition  The Trump administration is throwing some cold water on the once-hot market for Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth fighter. And that's not the company's only headache.          At least two NATO militaries are weighing alternatives to the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter as the US signals in public statements and unintentionally leaked private chats that it is less committed to Europe's defense. Top Trump officials have characterized Europe as a \"pathetic\" freeloader.               Trump's trade wars and public spats with the leaders of countries buying F-35s pose risks for Lockheed, which makes the fifth-generation F-35 fighter for the US military and foreign customers, aviation experts said.               A reduction in F-35 purchases by foreign buyers would drive up the cost-per-unit of jets, including for the US because the fixed costs can be spread across fewer planes.               Many foreign military sales \"are now endangered by these new concerns about US reliability,\" said Mark Cancian, a retired Marine Corps colonel and a senior advisor on defense and security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.               To make matters worse for Lockheed, Trump last week selected its rival, Boeing, to build the next-generation F-47 stealth fighter. Lockheed's stock briefly dropped following the contract announcement, and Bank of America downgraded the defense giant, citing the F-47 contract upset.               A Lockheed spokesperson said that \"foreign military sales are government-to-government transactions, so anything further will be best addressed by the US or respective customer governments.\" And on the F-47, the company has said it will continue to work with the Air Force on new capabilities.               The White House did not respond to a request for comment from BI on recent turbulence.               The Trump administration's warming position toward Russia and its criticism of NATO countries has triggered a shift in how some members of the alliance view their defense relationship with the US. NATO countries field a variety of US-made weapons, but the F-35 is a top product.               Earlier this month, Portugal's defense minister said that the country should re-consider replacing its arsenal of F-16s with the more advanced F-35s, citing the US stance on security issues as cause for concern.               Canada's defense minister then said the country would review alternatives to the F-35 amid rising tensions with the US over Trump-ordered tariffs and other trade threats.               A Canadian defense ministry spokesperson told BI that Canada is not canceling its planned F-35 fighter procurement, with deliveries set to begin next year. They said the ministry is \"in the early stages\" of reviewing the current F-35 process \"in a way that is both efficient and thorough.\"               Last week, the chairman of Denmark's parliamentary defense committee said he regretted buying the F-35, citing concerns that the US State Department could abruptly block spare parts needed to maintain the aircraft. He said purchasing American weapons is now \"a security risk.\"               The country's defense ministry told BI that \"any limitations in the use of Danish F-35 aircraft are classified information, but Denmark is still open to buying additional F-35 aircraft in the future.\"               Denmark, like Canada, is an original F-35 program participant. The fifth-gen aircraft has also been sold to another dozen countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Since the first F-35 rolled off the factory floor nearly two decades ago, over 1,100 jets have been delivered to allied and partner militaries.               Three other F-35 program participants, specifically the UK, Australia, and the Netherlands, voiced their continued support for this program.               The Dutch defense ministry told BI that there's \"no reason to assume that the good cooperation with the US in the F-35 program will change or stop,\" and a spokesperson for the Australian defense ministry said that it is \"committed to continued investment\" in the F-35.               Other allies, like Germany, have also reiterated their support for the program, even amid lingering uncertainty. A spokesperson for Poland's defense ministry told BI that its F-35 program \"is being implemented according to schedule. Currently, there are no decisions on the possible termination of the agreements signed with the American side.\"               NATO allies have not yet made any firm decisions to pull the plug on more F-35 procurement, but unease has replaced a once certain confidence. Analysts and experts say that US allies may be justifiably concerned about the potential leverage the Trump administration could have over them.               There's no kill switch or anything like that for the jets, but the US provides critical additional support for its weapons that makes them effective. American-led maintenance and supply chains, as well as networks and planning support, are essential to the program. Without them, these jets could end up being display pieces costing in excess of $80 million.               As with other weapons systems, the State Department must approve potential F-35 sales to foreign buyers. Trump raised eyebrows last week when he said some US allies might only be able to buy a less-capable version of the coming F-47. The US has sold modified export models of weapons, but the reasoning here was notable.               When he announced that Boeing Co., a longtime leader in stealth aircraft production, will build the sixth-generation Next Generation Air Dominance, or NGAD, fighter, Trump said that allies could purchase a \"toned-down\" version of the aircraft \"because, someday, maybe they're not our allies.\"               Richard Aboulafia, an aviation expert and the managing director of the US consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory, said that reduced foreign exports could drive up US purchasing costs. That's not great for the F-35 program.               The jet has faced criticism, including from the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency head Elon Musk, for design issues, program costs, and persistent sustainability challenges. There's a risk the plane could be targeted in future budget decisions, though that would be a bigger fight.               \"There is a scenario where a bunch of export orders go away, and a bunch of domestic US orders go away,\" Aboulafia said, adding that this \"would make this a much more expensive airplane and, therefore, more vulnerable to cuts.\"               Lockheed expects to deliver up to 190 F-35s to the US and its allies in 2025.               Retired US Army Maj. Gen. Gordon \"Skip\" Davis, who previously served as NATO's deputy assistant secretary-general for the alliance's defense-investment division, told BI that while it's possible a US administration could use F-35 support as leverage, \"doing so would come at a high strategic cost and provoke resistance from Congress, allies, and industry,\" not just Lockheed.               Davis told BI there are a number of constraints on the administration after the aircraft has been sold, including contractual obligations, jeopardizing multinational defense cooperation, and driving away foreign interest in the F-35.               He said that allied countries vary in their vulnerability. \"Countries without a domestic alternative and not involved in the F-35 component and parts production would be the most vulnerable to such a tactic,\" Davis said.               There are some European-made alternatives to the F-35, like the Eurofighter Typhoon fighter. However, no European jet matches the fifth-generation F-35, a low-observable networking platform capable of quarterbacking a range of combat capabilities.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"The latest super-balanced Plus phone from Samsung.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Samsung phone deals typically only come around a few times a year, and this year, it's looking like Spring is one of those occasions. For a limited time, you can get 16% off the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus for Amazon, just weeks after the S25 series hit store shelves in February. While the S25 Plus didn't come with any mind-blowing upgrades from the previous generation, it still offers an excellent phone experience with a powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and a beautiful 6.7-inch AMOLED display. This deal is for the 512GB storage configuration, though you can also find this phone with just 256GB of storage if need be. While the 4,900mAh battery isn't the biggest on the market, you can still pretty easily make it beyond a full day, even when using the screen for several hours. Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus: $1,119.99 $944.99 for Amazon's Big Spring Sale The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is already 16% off for this springtime Amazon sale, just two months after the phone's initial reveal. The latest-gen premium phone comes with a well-liked 6.7-inch AMOLED screen and a thin, comfortable design, making it a pretty solid pick amongst competitors at this discounted price point. \u2705Recommended if: you're looking for a powerful phone with smooth, cohesive performance; you want the newest in smartphone AI features, but on a Samsung phone; you have other devices within the Galaxy ecosystem. \u274cSkip this deal if: you prefer a larger or smaller screen and would rather go with the base S25 or S25 Ultra, respectively; you need a phone with industry-leading charging speeds. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus was released in January as part of the manufacturer's Galaxy Unpacked, alongside many of the best Samsung phones from the company's newest-generation lineup. The Plus comes with a 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, 12GB of RAM, and a powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processing chip, together which offers a smooth, satisfying and cohesive performance. The S25 Plus comes with the latest AI features within the Galaxy ecosystem, along with One UI, which many users love. While it will feel pretty familiar to those with the S24 Plus, it still may be worth upgrading if you want updated AI offerings and a slightly thinner overall design. The Plus primarily varies from the rest of the S25 series in its build size and battery, boasting much of the same hardware as the smaller, entry-level S25 and the larger S25 Ultra. You can get a compact 6.2-inch screen on the base S25 and a 6.9-inch screen on the S25 Ultra. These also include slightly smaller and larger battery sizes, respectively, though we didn't have any issues with any of them lasting under a day. Luckily for those who'd rather go in these directions, these phones also have their own discounts for Amazon's Big Spring Sale.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"The Lower Thames Crossing will become the largest road tunnel in the UK and is described by National Highways as \"the most significant road project in a generation\". But what about the people whose lives it will disrupt? Surrounded by rolling fields and a close-knit network of neighbours, Jackie Thacker's home in Orsett, Essex, provided the serene location she dreamt of enjoying retirement in. Yet one by one, those neighbours have packed their bags and left, never to return to the homes they once loved. The 75-year-old now faces a stark choice: sell up or live next to a major road. The government is pressing ahead with plans for the Lower Thames Crossing, a 14.5-mile (23km) road linking Essex and Kent via two tunnels underneath the river. It is due to be built by 2032 at a cost of up to \u00a310bn. But for those living on the route, confirmed by the government on Tuesday, that ambition holds less attraction. \"It's been like a noose around our neck, ever since the route was chosen,\" says Ms Thacker, who has lived in her house for 38 years. Ms Thacker, a grandmother, has spent most of the past four decades enjoying village life: walking to the pub, playing petanque and visiting the local cricket club. She becomes tearful while explaining how everything she loves about her life could soon be flattened, sold off or turned into a building site. \"Ever since we've been here, we've had wonderful neighbours,\" Ms Thacker says. \"But now the ones we've known for a long time have had to move out due to the pressures brought on by knowing the road was going through. \"It scared the life out of them, so they've moved on now.\" It is not the happy end she envisaged for her twilight years. \"It's breaking my heart,\" she admits. \"I'm stressed beyond belief. \"I could see myself being here until life's end and having a peaceful life's end, but it's not going to be peaceful anymore.\" For more than 60 years, the Dartford Crossing has been the only Thames road crossing east of London. Yet it is now used by more traffic than it was ever designed for, instead creating a bottleneck that frequently blocks up the M25. By providing an alternative route, linking the A2 and M2 in Kent with the A13 and M25 in Thurrock, it is hoped the Lower Thames Crossing will cut traffic there by 20%. About 2.6 miles (4.2km) of the route will be underground, with northbound and southbound tunnels running next to each other beneath the Thames. They are expected to be dug east of Gravesend in Kent and to the west of East Tilbury in Essex. But National Highways has been accused of hoovering up everything in its wake to clear the path for the new road. So far, it has spent more than \u00a31.2bn in planning and land costs. The authority says 76 residential properties are on land it needs for the route, 58 of which have already been purchased through a voluntary scheme. A total of 35 will be demolished, with the rest affected by construction. It insists each purchase has been \"robustly scrutinised\". Alan Rouse, who has lived in the same five-bedroom house in Orsett for 25 years, was among those urged to sell up. \"The whole thing is a complete mess from start to finish,\" he sighs. The 76-year-old was in the middle of building a property for his son in the garden when he got a knock on the door. \"They said 'Don't carry on building it - we're going to knock your house down,'\" he explains. That was in 2018. Five years later, Mr Rouse took another call. He was told his house was no longer needed. But Mr Rouse had already accepted a \u00a31.2m deal from National Highways, of which \u00a31m has landed in his bank account. He has now been given an ultimatum: keep the money and leave his home by November, or buy the property back from National Highways and stay. \"They should've thought of this. They've jumped in too early and bought properties they don't need,\" Mr Rouse says. \"But if this new road is going to go across the top of my house, we don't want to be here. It's upsetting for the whole family. \"I've sat in this mess for seven years now. Who makes that seven years up?\" Concerns have also been raised by campaigners, who fear ancient woodland will be destroyed when works begin in 2026. For Tony and Leigh Hughes, who have lived in South Ockendon for 34 years, the potential damage to wildlife has only worsened their grief. National Highways has promised that 80% of the crossing will run through either a tunnel, cutting or embankment to blend it into the landscape. It also wants to make seven \"green bridges\" to provide safer crossing points for people and wildlife. One of those bridges falls 75m (250ft) from Mr and Mrs Hughes's home. Mrs Hughes fears both residents and wildlife will be disrupted while it is constructed. \"There will be times where the traffic is 24\/7. We will not be able to get to our property and the road will be closed at weekends,\" she says. \"It's very, very sketchy on what our life is going to be like. \"It will affect people coming to our house. Who would want to visit us? It's a horrible, daunting thought that I could go out shopping and not be able to get home.\" The couple have been offered a deal for their house, but they believe it is 20% under its market value.  They says they feel trapped as their property is no longer an attractive proposition for any buyer. Mrs Hughes continues: \"It is a very inhumane situation to be in as we can't sell, other than to National Highways at a knocked-down price.\" Her husband, 56, adds: \"It's beautiful here and we never intended on leaving. \"Even though we own our property, we have no control over the situation at all. \"We have to find a cash buyer that's willing to buy a lovely cottage next to a motorway and I'm sorry, but those buyers are very, very few and far between.\" In a statement to the BBC, National Highways insists its landmark project will \"improve journeys and bring significant benefits\" to the region. However, a spokesman admits there will be an impact on properties along the route. \"Through a comprehensive programme of consultation we have been able to significantly reduce the number affected by almost 70%, and reached voluntary agreements with many,\" he says. \"Following confirmation of our planning consent this week we will be speaking again to impacted property owners about next steps.\" But what is next for those set to have their lives uprooted? \"We don't know where we'll be in five years,\" says Mr Hughes. \"I do know this area won't be as beautiful as it is now.\" A tearful Ms Thacker adds: \"I just can't visualise moving. I love the place so much and I think moving would be too stressful.\" As for Mr Rouse, he concludes: \"I've got nowhere to go, but I don't want to live here with this big road going over my house. \"Highways don't care though, do they? They're not worried; they just want their road in.\" Follow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X. The show features horseback stunts, sword fighting, motorbikes and opera singers. Guru Nanak FC, who play their games in Gravesend, are celebrating their 60th anniversary. The 34-year-old says she could \"never repay\" nurses for what they did for her.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"  \t\t\t\t(Mis)Uses of Technology\t\t\t  Clearview saw an opening in the facial recognition market and took full advantage of it. While most tech firms offered face-matching tech of dubious accuracy, Clearview went further, matching its AI to the billions of records it has harvested for free from the open internet. (And while this effort certainly wasn\u2019t free, it definitely was cheaper than hiring a third party to do its web scraping for it.)  Not satisfied with its 10 billion+ stack of scraped photos and personal data, Clearview turned to other companies to help it continue to build a database none of its competitors would be able to compete with. (Not that any of them wanted to compete with Clearview. In fact, other facial recognition tech companies have taken care to distance themselves from Clearview and its web scraping-based business model.)  As Freddy Martinez reports for 404 Media, newly obtained documents show Clearview was willing to spend some of its own money to obtain (or at least access) more than a billion additional data points from a third party \u201cintelligence firm.\u201d  New documents obtained\u00a0by 404 Media reveal that Clearview AI spent nearly a\u00a0million dollars\u00a0in a bid to purchase \u201c690 million arrest records and 390 million arrest photos\u201d from all 50 states from an intelligence firm. The contract further describes the records as including current and former home addresses, dates of birth, arrest photos, social security and cell phone numbers, and email addresses. Clearview attempted to purchase this data from Investigative Consultant, Inc. (ICI) which billed\u00a0itself as an intelligence company\u00a0with access to tens of thousands of databases and the ability to create unique data streams for its clients. The contract was signed in mid-2019, at a time when Clearview AI was quietly collecting billions of photos off the internet and was relatively unknown at the time.\u00a0 As the report notes, this happened before Clearview began racking up negative headlines all over the world, thanks mostly to Kashmir Hill\u2019s expose of the company and it tactics (and its miserable set of financial backers) for the New York Times. This was prior to the numerous lawsuits, fines, fees, and expulsions from foreign countries that initial reporting led to.  That also means this happened back when Clearview still had money to spend. At this point, Clearview still has tens of billions of data points and an unknown number of paying customers, but it hardly seems like a tech firm that\u2019s likely to survive much longer now that its largest revenue stream is considered so toxic most potential customers are look at other options. In fact, Clearview is so cash poor it has been trying to hand out stock options instead of actual money in lawsuit settlements. Clearview \u2014 especially as portrayed by its founder, Hoan Ton-That \u2014 depicts itself as the fastest mover in the breaking things tech market, a company so smart and self-assured that it can\u2019t possibly be overtaken by its competitors and\/or forced out of the market by the numerous laws around the world that make its data collection efforts illegal.  But the evidence shows Clearview isn\u2019t all that smart, actually. This contract fell through and both parties sued each other for breach of contract. This ended up being one of the rare cases where Clearview came out ahead in litigation. But if it had any hope of clawing back the ~$1 million it paid to ICI, those hopes were extinguished more than five years ago when Clearview first entered this contract.  Clearview AI may also never recover the over one million dollars from ICI or its president: instead of wiring the money to an escrow service, Clearview instead deposited it\u00a0directly into Berlin\u2019s personal checking account.\u00a0 Nice. This makes Clearview look like someone\u2019s grandparent. Maybe Clearview was told things would move faster if it just cut a check to cash and sent it to ICI\u2019s owner directly. Or maybe ICI managed to nullify the contractual prenup by convincing Clearview no escrow would be necessary. Either way, Clearview got played and the money it wants back from the company was never paid directly to this data broker\/\u201dintelligence firm.\u201d Instead, it went directly into the pocket of the company\u2019s president (Donald Berlin) who may not have any legal, much less moral, compunction to return the funds. This feels like another mileage marker on the road to Clearview\u2019s ultimate exit from the marketplace of\u2026 um\u2026 marketplaces. At this point, it\u2019s just limping along, selling access to entities that don\u2019t mind doing business with a business on the precipice of bankruptcy and don\u2019t really care where the data come from or the accuracy of the algorithm used to generate matches. And while I sincerely continue to cheer on what looks like a slow-moving demise of a truly terrible AI firm, I\u2019m not so optimistic some other tech bro with even worse ideas won\u2019t buy what\u2019s left of this mess for pennies on the dollar and turn into something far worse than what it already is.    \tFiled Under: facial recognition tech, privacy, surveillance, web scraping   \tCompanies: clearview, clearview ai, investigative consultant inc.  All that data from either company isn\u2019t just going to disappear. Look for Big Balls or some other Doge goon to end up with 25% of the company after seling them the private data of every registered democrat and getting a blanket pardon. We know it\u2019s coming. Think of all of the information they can now buy from Musk\u2026 Wow. Clearview has made a name for it self for a number of things, including being super sketchy. But ICI here comes out looking almost as sketchy as Clearview. Wiring the money to the company president instead of the company reminds me of that old quote from WC Fields: \u201cYou cant cheat an honest man\u201d.  Somehow, Clearview had to think they would gain something by avoiding payment to the company. Shut them down Your email address will not be published.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"Business Insider Edition  Scott Barbee, manager of the Aegis Value Fund (AVALX) and Business Insider's Investor of the Month for March, is no stranger to the ups and downs of the stock market.          Barbee has overseen the fund since its inception in 1998, which means he's weathered some of the biggest market crashes over the decades.               Barbee specializes in finding deep-value small-cap companies. He analyzes investment opportunities using a bottom-up approach and looks for companies with low debt balances, robust cash flow, and cheap valuations.               Despite tariff volatility and recession fears rocking the market in 2025, Barbee is finding ways to outperform. His fund is up over 11% year-to-date.               Below, Barbee shared with Business Insider some of the takeaways he's learned from steering the fund through over 25 years of market cycles.               When asked about the AI trade, Barbee expressed caution and drew comparisons to the dot-com bubble.               \"Historically, you've seen certain situations where folks get very interested in a particular type of scientific advancement, and you get very high multiples for a while, then you get over-building and corrections,\" Barbee said.               Similar to how internet-based companies skyrocketed in 2000 and then plunged almost 80% afterwards, AI stocks could be heading into bubble territory, Barbee believes.               Especially in recent years, the meteoric outperformance of the Magnificent Seven has been perplexing to Barbee, especially as interest rates crept up from pandemic lows.               \"Typically, higher interest rates act as a gravitational force pulling the multiples down,\" Barbee said.               In his opinion, the momentum these tech stocks have seen in recent years creates a snowball effect where investors keep on allocating capital to the sector, bidding up valuations past reasonable levels.               \"My sense is we're going to get a correction at some point,\" Barbee added.               Instead of hopping aboard the Magnificent Seven train, Barbee swooped up unloved materials and metals stocks.               \"A lot of these have scored poorly on ESG frameworks. In 2021, 2022, there was this huge prevalence of ESG-type investing and mandated divestment of fossil fuel-type businesses, and mining is sometimes viewed poorly under those rubrics,\" Barbee said. \"That's led to a lot of purging of positions for non-fundamental reasons that long-term investors could take advantage of, and we positioned ourselves into a lot of those names.\"               It turns out materials and metals ended up being the areas of the market that outperformed amid tariff volatility. Gold is at an all-time high as investors run to safe-haven assets, and Barbee thinks there's still more room for gold mining stock prices to rise.               Even the best fund managers have bad days \u2014 or bad years.               \"I think 2008 was one of the roughest years in my career,\" Barbee told Business Insider. \"We had a big drawdown. It was 50% or so.\"               The fund started 2009 with another 20% decline. The especially frustrating part about the fund's 2008 performance was that much of it was out of Barbee's control.               \"You can do your work, you can determine whether the company's on fiscally solid ground,\" Barbee said. \"We suffered these big drawdowns anyway because it was much less about the companies themselves. It was much more about the other owners of the companies.\"               When homeowners began defaulting on their mortgages, highly levered banks like Lehman Brothers saw the value of their mortgage-backed securities plunge and experienced a credit crunch.               \"The Lehman Brothers proprietary trading desk would own a lot of the names that they would then be forced to liquidate as they were getting the repo lines pulled, in what amounted to a huge margin call,\" Barbee told BI. \"Some of the names traded down to underneath cash value per share.\"               \"Being able to ride through periods of volatility where other stockholders might get washed out is a very important aspect of getting through those difficult times,\" Barbee added. \"Sometimes the best opportunities become clearly available when you're feeling the worst about yourself.\"               Ultimately, staying steadfast paid off \u2014 the fund bounced back strong and was up 91% by the end of 2009.               For Barbee, the most rewarding part of the job has been the relationships he's built with clients. Some of his clients have been with him from the beginning and weathered the last two financial crises alongside the fund.               \"To have the clients that decide to stay with you through difficult times, and then have it work out for everybody is is a really rewarding thing,\" Barbee said.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"Army claims control of Souq Libya, a pivotal commercial hub in Omdurman, solidifying gains in Khartoum\u2019s twin city. The Sudanese army has said it seized control of a key market in Omdurman, Khartoum\u2019s twin city, building on a series of recent successes in its offensive against the Rapid Support Forces (RSF). But the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said Saturday, \u201cThe joy of victory will not be complete until the last rebel is eliminated in the last corner of Sudan\u2019s land.\u201d The announcement of the latest gain on Saturday comes days after SAF also took control of most parts of the capital in a potentially pivotal victory in the devastating two-year war that has caused the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis. The army said in a statement that its forces were now in control of the market in western Omdurman, Souq Libya, having seized weapons and equipment left behind by the RSF when they fled. Souq Libya is one of the largest and most important commercial hubs in Sudan. The army already controlled most of Omdurman, home to two big military bases. It appears intent on securing control over the entire capital area, which is made up of the three cities of Khartoum, Omdurman and Bahri, divided by branches of the River Nile. The RSF has not commented on the army\u2019s advance in Omdurman, where the paramilitary forces still hold some territory. Al-Burhan said the following in a speech to mark Eid al-Fitr: \u201cThe joy of victory will not be complete until the last rebel is eliminated in the last corner of Sudan\u2019s land. We will not neglect the sacrifices of our martyrs. The war has done the worst to the nation and the people. We will not compromise or negotiate. Militias must lay down their weapons, and we thank the groups that fought alongside the armed forces. There is no retreat from defeating and crushing the terrorist Al-Dagalo militia.\u201d \u0643\u0644\u0645\u0629 \u0631\u0626\u064a\u0633 \u0645\u062c\u0644\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u064a\u0627\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0626\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0645 \u0644\u0644\u0642\u0648\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062d\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u064a\u0642 \u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0643\u0646 \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062a\u0627\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0633\u0628\u0629 \u0639\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0637\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u064f\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0643#\u0633\u0648\u0646\u0627 #\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u062f\u0627\u0646 pic.twitter.com\/cgXiUh3R24 \u2014 SUDAN News Agency (SUNA) \ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\udde9 (@SUNA_AGENCY) March 29, 2025  Translation: Speech by the Chairman of the Sovereignty Council, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, on the occasion of Eid al-Fitr.\u00a0 The army senses that the recapture of Khartoum, which had been under RSF control for most of the war, will mark a shift in battlefield momentum that could spread to other areas. Still, the conflict seems far from over as the warring sides remain in control of large swaths of land each while remaining engaged in fierce clashes. Fighting is continuing in the huge Darfur region to the west of Sudan, the Kordofan region in central and southern parts of the country, and Gezira state, a strategic agricultural hub located south of the capital. Neither side has managed to strike a knockout blow to the other, and there is no sign of a political settlement or peace process in the near future, while each side continues to enjoy the support of its regional backers.      In the meantime, the Sudanese army has accused the United Arab Emirates of backing the RSF, a charge found credible by UN experts and US lawmakers. On Friday, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) said it would hear a case filed by Sudan demanding emergency measures against the UAE for violating obligations under the Genocide Convention by giving direct support to the RSF and implicating it in genocidal acts allegedly perpetrated by the paramilitary group against the Masalit people of Darfur. The Gulf state has repeatedly denied the accusations, calling the ICJ case \u201cnothing more than a cynical publicity stunt\u201c. In January, the United States accused the RSF of committing genocide in Darfur. The war in Sudan erupted amid a power struggle between the army and the RSF before a planned transition to civilian rule. It uprooted more than 12 million Sudanese from their homes and left about half of the 50 million population suffering acute hunger. Overall deaths are hard to estimate, but a study published last year said the toll may have reached 61,000 in Khartoum state alone in the first 14 months of the conflict. In another development, Al Jazeera Arabic reports that the army evacuated hundreds of freed civilian and military prisoners held by the RSF in several detention centres in Jebel Awliya, south of Khartoum, to the city of Al-Qatana in White Nile State. Sudanese army commander Major General Mohamed Saleh Abu Halima said that the RSF detained approximately 4,700 prisoners under appalling conditions, where they suffered from malnutrition and a lack of healthcare, leading to the deaths of several of them in detention.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"ByBilly Bambrough  ByBilly Bambrough,  Senior Contributor.  03\/30 update below. This post was originally published on March 29 Bitcoin and crypto prices have dropped back as inflation fears and U.S. president Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threats continue to weigh on the bitcoin price (as well as fresh fears over a new, mystery hack). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes\u2019 CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can \"uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!\" The bitcoin price has fallen back toward $80,000 per bitcoin after soaring toward $90,000 this week even after the confirmation of a long-awaited bitcoin game-changer. Now, as bitcoin is found to be outperforming Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla, legendary crypto trader Arthur Hayes has predicted the Federal Reserve will trigger a bitcoin price boom in April. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex\u2014A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell could be about to trigger bitcoin price and crypto market ... More mayhem. \u201cThere was a seminal change in the [Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell\u2019s] tone at the last Fed board meeting,\u201d Hayes, the cofounder of crypto derivatives pioneer BitMex who went onto launch the Maelstrom investment company, told podcaster Kyle Chasse. Earlier this month, the Fed\u2019s rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kept interest rates on hold after kicking off a rate-cutting cycle in September. 03\/30 update: Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, who has clashed with president Donald Trump over the pace of interest rate reductions, could be fired by the president, an influential Democratic Party senator has warned.  \u201cNobody is safe, not even the chairman of the Federal Reserve,\" Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren told Bloomberg. \"If [Trump] can just mow through every civil servant, if he can just mow through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, it\u2019s a form of lawlessness and all the power belongs to the king.\" Warren\u2019s warning comes as Trump, aided by Tesla billionaire Elon Musk who\u2019s leading the Doge department of government efficiency in a rampage through the federal government, has gutted agencies, departments and institutions in the mere two months he\u2019s been back in the White House. Fed chair Powell, appointed by Trump in his first term, has said he wants to take a wait-and-see approach to lowering interest rates, which remain elevated after Covid era stimulus and lockdowns sent inflation spiraling out of control. However, Trump has called for rates to be lowered immediately, claiming lower rates would help his plan for wide-scale international trade tariffs. \u201cThe Fed would be much better off cutting rates as U.S. tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy,\u201d Trump posted to his Truth Social account last week, telling Powell and the Fed to, \u201cdo the right thing.\u201d The FOMC downgraded its outlook for economic growth while nudging up its inflation projection and further scaling back of its \u201cquantitative tightening\u201d program in which it is slowly reducing the bonds it holds on its balance sheet. Hayes, who\u2019s this week been granted a pardon along with his fellow BitMex founders Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed for Bank Secrecy Act violations by U.S. president Donald Trump, believes the Fed is \"teasing\" a return to \u201cstealth\u201d money printing known as quantitative easing even as it\u2019s grappling with the $36 trillion U.S. debt pile that\u2019s spiraled out of control since 2020. Hayes pointed to comments made by Powell at the latest Fed press conference that \u201cinflationary aspects of tariffs are transitory.\" \u201cTariffs don\u2019t matter any more to Powell, and they shouldn\u2019t matter as crypto investors,\u201d said Hayes. \u201cIf Trump does 50% or he does 2%, it doesn\u2019t matter, because we know that Powell is going to continue to provide the easy monetary conditions that we need to have our portfolios go up in fiat dollars.\u201d Sign up now for CryptoCodex\u2014A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher in recent years, with a Federal Reserve flip predicted to push ...

Meanwhile, the bitcoin price could be about to rebound toward $90,000, according to 10x Research founder Markus Thielen, who has predicted a combination of Trump\u2019s softening of tariffs and an increasingly dovish Fed is setting bitcoin up for a recovery. \u201cBitcoin is attempting to form a bottom, supported by Trump\u2019s recent shift toward \u2018flexibility\u2019 on the upcoming April 2 reciprocal tariffs, softening his earlier rhetoric,\u201d Thielen wrote in an emailed note.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"Business Insider Edition  Fans of \"Parks and Recreation\" can finally live out their dreams of living in Pawnee \u2014 sort of.          Pawnee City, Nebraska, which is about 90 minutes south of Lincoln, Nebraska, and two hours north of Kansa City, Missouri, is offering $50,000 to new residents who qualify.               Between March 14, when the program was announced, and March 27, 115 people have applied, Pawnee City Chamber of Commerce official Aaron Sawyer told Business Insider.               The city's plan, dubbed Vision 2030, starts with a commitment to build 25 new single-family homes on currently empty lots. Plans on the Vision 2030 website show ranch-style homes with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, two-car garages, and spacious backyards priced at $325,000. (The average home value in Pawnee City is $102,705, according to Zillow.)               The program's $50,000 payouts will go toward down payment assistance for buyers of the new houses.               Applications are open to families, single professionals, or retirees. Qualified homebuyers must make less than certain income caps, which range from $69,450 for a one-person household to $115,100 for a six-person household.               Interested homebuyers must complete an application form that asks for their current employers, monthly incomes, and household sizes.               In November 2024, workers broke ground on the first home, which is expected to be ready for move-in by this summer, according to the Vision 2030 website.               Remote work can be a source of tension between employers and their workers, with Amazon and J.P. Morgan calling employees back to the office five days a week five years after their initial COVID-19 shutdowns. But for those who still have the flexibility, the opportunity to move somewhere with a financial incentive can be enticing in today's expensive housing market, where older homes may cost just as much as new builds.               The down-payment assistance initiative is part of Pawnee City's effort to spark a \"rural renaissance\" that could rejuvenate the town, according to the Vision 2030 website.               Its population has dwindled. Pawnee City has 865 residents, according to the most recent data available from the US Census.The city has experienced a 50-year decline from a population high of 1,280 residents, according to the civic group Pawnee Bold.               For such a small place, Pawnee City has still producedseveral notable figures, including the first governor of Nebraska, David Butler; vintage Hollywood star Irish McCalla; and famous comedian Larry the Cable Guy.               \"It's a great place to grow up and raise kids,\" said Sawyer, who has ties to the city through his grandparents. Pawnee City has its own school, hospital, two parks, and a brand-new amphitheater that just opened last year, he added, which is notable for a town of its size.               This summer's amphitheaterprogramming will include a polka band, a rock concert, and a screening of \"Cars\" that features a visit from the hometown hero himself: Larry the Cable Guy.

Referred to as \"Tesla Shield\" in some of the social media posts on Facebook and X, the supporters are trying to organize an answer to the Tesla Takedown demonstrations.

A Tesla Takedown organizer told Business Insider that more than 266 planned demonstrations had been confirmed, and the group was \"getting updates hourly as new events are being added.\"               One individual on X, who goes by the handle @PatriotDadEV2.0, wrote on March 23 that he \"had enough\" after seeing a group of protestersat a Tesla dealership in Columbus, and decided to \"start an effort here to create a shield around the facility next time they show up.\"               Their digital flyer, titled \"Join the Tesla Shield,\" has since been reposted by other accounts on Facebook and X.

She said she supported Musk's work.               \"He's proven his record. I look up to him,\" she told NBC News. \"Every person should look up to him.\"               Some pro-Trump and pro-Tesla counterprotests have already taken place in recent weeks.               One social media user posted a video on X showing a group of Trump supporters waving American flags while counter-protesting an anti-Musk protest in Westmont, Illinois\u00a0in March. In Tennessee, counter-protesters also appeared at recent anti-Tesla protests, though some stumbled upon the event rather than organizing a formal effort, local publication The Tennessee Star reported on Monday.               Another social media user posted a video on March 22 of a Cybertruck driver chanting \"USA\" while driving past a Tesla protest in Tennessee.               Other Trump or Musk fans have suggested other ways to support the company. One user posted a poem about the cause on Truth Social and asked that people counter anti-Tesla efforts \"by investing in Tesla stock\" to show \"unwavering support\" for those helping MAGA efforts.               The pro-Tesla efforts come as Tesla protests and vandalism incidents have ramped up around the country in response to Musk's political involvement with DOGE. Some of the incidents have involved graffiti, gunfire, and arson, pointed at Tesla buildings and vehicles.               Several arrests have been made, with the latest occurring on Thursday following the damage of five Tesla vehicles, three of which were destroyed by fire, resulting in arson charges.               The \"Tesla Takedown\" organization told BI that there were scheduled protests at Tesla dealerships and showrooms in Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.               The protest organizers hosted a virtual planning session last week with over 6,000 attendees, the organizers said. They said the Tesla Takedown movement stands for peaceful and nonviolent protests.               Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"ByPamela N. Danziger  ByPamela N. Danziger,  Senior Contributor.  NEW YORK, NY - JANUARY 28: A Lululemon corporate logo hangs above their store in Soho on January 28, ... More 2023, in New York City.  (Photo by Gary Hershorn\/Getty Images) Athleisurewear giant Lululemon just delivered an otherwise strong fourth quarter and full-year earnings report with results exceeding expectations. Annual sales surpassed $10 billion for the first time, reaching $10.6 billion on 10% year-over-year growth. The fourth quarter ended Feb. 2 posted 13% gains to $3.6 billion and a 14% increase in income from operations to $1 billion. Yet, the company\u2019s tempered guidance spooked Wall Street. Lululemon shares plunged 14% after the market opened on Friday and fell a bit further to end as the worst performing S&P 500 stock for the day. Lululemon expects first quarter 2025 revenues to range between $2.335 billion and $2.355 billion, up between 6% to 7%, and full year to reach $11.15 billion to $11.3 billion on 5% to 7% growth. However, that may not be enough for the company to realize its ambitious \u201cPower of Three x2\u201d strategic plan that called for revenues to double from $6.25 billion in 2021 to $12.5 billion by 2026. Despite assurances that the company remains focused on executing the plan, achieving its ultimate goal is slipping further away. Investment firm Jefferies projects Lululemon revenues to only advance 2% this year and reach $11.1 billion in fiscal 2026, well off the company\u2019s goal. Most troubling is that in the Americas where the company generates 75% of revenues, comparative year-end revenues fell 1%, excluding the extra 53rd trading week, and were flat in the fourth quarter. On a net revenue basis, U.S. annual sales rose 2% to $6.5 billion but comparable sales were flat, excluding the 53rd week. Canada advanced 10% to $1.4 billion \u2013 Lululemon is a Canadian company \u2013 bringing the Americas\u2019 total up 4% to $7.9 billion. But growth headwinds continue to mount. CEO Calvin McDonald cited a survey conducted with Ipsos across the U.S. that found, \u201cConsumers are spending less due to increased concerns about inflation and the economy.\u201d American consumers\u2019 hesitancy to splurge is resulting in \u201cslower traffic across the industry in the U.S. in quarter one, which we are experiencing in our business as well,\u201d he continued. Lululemon is heavily dependent on its fleet of U.S. stores. More than half of its 720 company-owned stores are located in the States, totaling 374 stores up from 367 in 2023. It has 71 stores in Canada, same as in 2023, while it added 17 in Mexico late last year after acquiring franchise operations there, bringing the total number of stores in the Americas to 462. And 10 to 15 of the net 40 to 50 new stores planned in 2025 will open in the Americas. In 2019, McDonald introduced the original \u201cPower of Three\u201d plan and then a revised version, the \u201cPower of Three x2,\u201d in 2022. The goals of the revised plan were to double menswear and e-commerce revenues and to quadruple international revenues relative to 2021. As of 2024, it is nearly $2.7 billion from the $12.5 billion finish line: It\u2019s not impossible for Lululemon to reach its goal, but it\u2019s increasingly unlikely. From 2022 to 2023, revenues grew by $1.5 billion, from $8.1 billion to $9.6 billion. However, it grew sales by only $969 million in 2024 and this year\u2019s guidance expects the company to add less than that. While McDonald emphasized newness and innovation as the brand\u2019s strength going into 2025 \u2013\u201cOur newness is back to being on par where it\u2019s been in the past,\u201d he said, as he called out newness over 25 times in the earnings call \u2013 he cautioned that macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, \u201cespecially in the U.S.,\u201d were weighing expectations down. Promising to \u201ccontrol what we can control\u201d\u2013 a well-rehearsed talking point he stated five times \u2013 McDonald cautioned, \u201cWe also acknowledge the uncertainty in the retail environment as the consumer is navigating a dynamic macro environment.\u201d Beyond the macroeconomic uncertainties, lagging consumer confidence and growing inflation and tariff anxieties, Lululemon can\u2019t control the pull of customers to other premium and more affordable brands, such as Gap Inc.\u2019s Athleta and Old Navy, Target All In Motion, American Eagle\u2019s Offline by Aerie and Fabletics, which is trying to break out of its exclusionary membership model. At the more directly competitive premium end, Vuori is growing rapidly and tends to be priced a couple of notches below Lululemon for comparable products. Through the end of October last year, CNBC reported Vuori sales had grown by 23%. Notably, Vuori launched in 2014 with men\u2019s shorts, the same year Lululemon ventured into menswear, where it faced the burden of overcoming its perception as primarily a women\u2019s performance brand. Alo Yoga is also giving Lululemon a run for its money, offering what many consider more fashion-forward styles and like Vuori, at better prices. Jeffferies retail analyst Randy Konik observed that in the vital U.S. market, brands like Vuori and Alo are figuratively eating Lululemon\u2019s lunch. \u201cFive years ago, Alo and Vuori were ... nothing burgers, and that\u2019s when Lululemon was growing 20% a year, whatever it is, or more. Today, you look at the numbers and you\u2019re like, wait a second, the business is flat,\u201d he shared with CNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s not growing, and yet it\u2019s coinciding with the hypergrowth of Alo and Vuori. So, in my opinion, the data proves that it is a market share issue.\u201d And then Nike hangs over Lululemon too. While Nike apparel sales didn\u2019t grow last fiscal year, staying level at $13.8 billion through May 2024, and apparel revenues declined by 3% in the most recent third quarter 2025, it is and will remain a dominant competitive force. In the earnings call, McDonald didn\u2019t speak to the market share issue, but he did address the need to grow Lululemon brand awareness, saying it remains low in \u201cnearly every market\u201d where it operates. Unaided brand awareness is in the single digits in France, Germany and Japan. In Mainland China, it is in the mid-to-high teens. China was a major contributor to growth in 2024, up 38% to $1.4 billion, with comparable sales growing 27%, and it\u2019s vital for the future. China is also slated to get the majority of international new store openings this year. Lululemon unaided brand awareness is reported to be in the 20s in the U.K. and Australia and in the 30s in the U.S., levels that few would call low for an apparel brand. However, McDonald stressed that raising brand awareness, \u201cparticularly in the U.S.\u201d is a \u201cmeaningful opportunity.\u201d Given that Lululemon already has what most would consider strong brand awareness here, will moving it up a few points really be enough to turn around flagging sales in the U.S.? Data from location intelligence platform Placer.ai suggests that Lululemon\u2019s built a brand perception in the U.S. that may prove more of a weakness than a strength. It reported that during the last week in December, Lululemon\u2019s U.S. store visits doubled over the year\u2019s weekly average. Placer.ai analyst Bracha Arnold attributes it to the company\u2019s End of Year sale. \u201cOne of the few occasions when the brand offers store-wide discounts,\u201d she wrote, indicating that Lululemon may be perceived as too expensive to shop at during the rest of the year. Analyst Konik gave that snarky headline to Jefferies\u2019 latest research report on Lululemon in which he outlines the many weaknesses he sees ahead for the brand, such as worsening February mall traffic, macroeconomic uncertainties not just in the U.S. but affecting China too, an inventory buildup that risks elevating the gross margin, increased investment in marketing, technology and data analytics costs, over-reliance on new products and foreign exchange and tariff headwinds. Konik concludes that consensus expectations are too positive, \u201cgiven the rising competition.\u201d And he added, \u201cWe see the U.S. market turning negative ahead against difficult compares. Further sales and EPS growth will be challenging.\u201d See Also:","label":1}

On the 5th floor of her university dormitory building, she wasn't used to the rumbling sound coming from the lower floors. Then, the earthquake began. \"I realized there was a problem, and if I didn't get down soon, I wouldn't be able to escape anymore,\" she said. \"I thought, 'Am I going to survive?' \" Chit had experienced quakes in Myanmar before, but never on this scale. The temblor with a magnitude of 7.7, struck at around 12:50 p.m. local time (1:50 a.m. ET) on Friday. It has devastated large areas within Myanmar, and was felt in Thailand and China as well. State-run media reports that the death toll has now risen to over 1,600, with over 3,400 injured inside Myanmar. It is thought the death toll will continue to rise.                  The map above shows the epicenter of a 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar.                                                           Phil Holm\/AP                                       hide caption  The quake's epicenter, roughly 10 miles from the town of Sagaing in central Myanmar, is close to Myanmar's second most populated city, Mandalay. The damage there and in the surrounding regions has been extensive. Rushing down to the ground floor, Chit emerged onto the streets of Mandalay, now covered in dust. Videos shared on social media show wreckage on the streets, with multiple buildings collapsed. Another shows the Sagaing bridge, an important connecting point between Mandalay and the rest of Myanmar, destroyed. \"People are asking for help to rescue their family members from the fallen-down buildings. On the street, the people who could escape from dangerous conditions are sleeping on the empty ground,\" Chit said. John McGown, program director for Plan International, an NGO active in Myanmar, said, \"We have staff members who have family in Mandalay that weren't able to sleep inside their homes last night because of fear of tremors.\" Internet and phone lines were also cut in Mandalay, Sagaing, and in southern Shan state, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies reported Saturday. Although some areas are now periodically reconnected, the disconnect initially left residents like Chit cut off from their families, unable to find out whether they had survived or not. In the face of the destruction, Myanmar's ruling military junta have made a rare request for humanitarian aid. On Friday, Russia said 120 rescue workers had been sent to Myanmar to assist in the search for victims caught in the rubble. China, meanwhile, has pledged to provide Myanmar with 100 million yuan ($13.8 million) in humanitarian aid and also sent teams to assist in relief efforts. President Trump on Friday said the U.S. would also help with the response. But, although countries around the world have pledged to send support, the quake has also made coordination of rescue efforts more difficult. Plan International's McGown told NPR that communication difficulties have made it impossible for teams from the organization to coordinate in real time as they enter the hardest hit areas. Damage to infrastructure has also slowed teams' efforts to reach certain towns. The quake has compounded existing issues within Myanmar. Since 2021, the country has been run by a military junta and been engaged in an ongoing civil war that has devastated large areas. \"The earthquake has taken what were already marginal issues and has made them worse and made it more difficult to access information and even to access certain areas,\" McGown said. The initial quake has also been followed by numerous aftershocks of up to 6.4 magnitude. In Bangkok, which was also hit by the quake, rescue efforts have focused on a 30-story building that collapsed following the earthquake. With drones, sniffer dogs and heavy machinery, rescue operators have been working around the clock to free dozens of people thought to be trapped inside. Families of those trapped inside have congregated outside of the slumped building. Many have been waiting there for more than 24 hours, holding out hope that their loved ones will soon emerge.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"Business Insider Edition  This could be your hot, dog summer.          While some pick up the scent of seemingly bound-for-greatness junior roles offered by stalwarts like Google, Goldman, and McKinsey, one pet care company in New York City wants to fill an internship that offers an alternative: \"dog breath sniffer.\"               And the job market being what it is, the role, whose compensation includes $25 an hour and \"unlimited puppy kisses,\" is getting more traction than you might think.               Among the more than 100 applicants Spot & Tango has had for the posting, which went up Wednesday, more than half have bachelor's degrees, 20% have a master's degree, and nearly 10% hold MBAs, stats on LinkedIn show.               The company makes meals, snacks, and supplements for dogs.               While it's not an early April Fool's \u2014 we checked \u2014 it is actually a slightly different role than described.               It began as a dog and pony show cooked up by Spot & Tango's PR folks but has now morphed into a serious marketing internship, Chondita Dayton, the company's head of marketing, told Business Insider.               The role will actually involve customer research and community outreach.               \"It is not going to be a sommelier of dog scents,\" she said.               Like the work itself, the competition also appears serious. Some applicants hold Ivy League degrees. Dayton said one \"friendly acquaintance\" contacted her through LinkedIn to ensure her niece's application for the six-week program would be seen.               Dayton said Spot & Tango employees, which include about 50 people at its New York corporate office, have been getting \"nonstop\" texts and emails asking whether the job is real. Recommendations are flying as well.               Many people, eager to prove their dog-loving bona fidos, have included pictures of themselves with a pooch in their applications.               Dayton said it's self-evident, yet also spelled out in the job description, that the successful candidate will love dogs, even if the person isn't really nostrils to tongue on this one.               Instead, she said, whomever the company selects will spend 35 hours a week roughly split between office work doing things like contacting customers and the rest attending events and canvassing Gotham to chat up dog owners about the company's new product for \"canine dental wellness.\"               The work should be fun, Dayton said, because the industry is, too.               \"Pet brands are not above talking about number two's,\" she said.               While it's not a surprise, many applications are replete with puns \u2014 descriptions of a willingness to go \"nose-deep\" into the work and jokes about rsums fetched, Dayton said. One applicant described a passion for creating \"the world's first breath freshness scoring algorithm.\" Take that, AI.               Another detailed the person's love for sampling cheeses, while the \"achievements\" section of one person's rsum included the self-conferred accolade \"Best Doggy Owner 2024.\"               One possible reason the internship has drawn interest \u2014 beyond those hoping to manifest their urban Devil Wears Pawda fantasy \u2014 is that so many of us are obsessed with our pets. They're a big business.               Revenue in the pet-care industry more than quadrupled from 2004 to 2021, totaling $10.7 billion in 2021, according to the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.               Jeffrey Simmons, CEO of Elanco Animal Health, which makes medicines and vaccines for pets and livestock, told BI that factors such as an aging population, loneliness, the pandemic, and a decrease in the number of people having children have pushed some households to get pets and driven others to go from, say, one dog to two.               Simmons also said that, in some cases, the prevalence of people's anxiety is also a factor.               \"Pets become the non-pharmaceutical intervention,\" he said.               Spot & Tango has likewise seen a rise in Gen Z and millennial \"pet parents,\" especially in urban areas. So, Dayton said, it makes sense to have someone in New York doing some grassroots marketing \u2014 talking with people at dog parks and interacting with smaller dog communities.               She said the internship could lead to a bigger role. That would require the right candidate, perhaps someone who shows dogged determination.               \"It's a five-senses kind of job,\" Dayton said. \"No one said dog breath is pretty.\"       Additional reporting by Steven Tweedie.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"News The British competition watchdog Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has blamed tech behemoths Apple and Google for creating an unfavorable mobile browser market for consumers and businesses. The study was conducted by an independent group for the watchdog which stated that Safari and WebKit on iOS, make it difficult for third-party web browsers to compete. Further, Google has also been found complicit in restricting competition on its Android platform. The iPhone maker requires web browsers on iOS to be based on its WebKit browser engine which, according to the watchdog, limits the browser functionality. The limitations reportedly extend to in-app browsing features. Safari continues to remain the default web-browser on iPhone which reduces the likelihood of users installing other web browsers, add the investigators. CMA stated that similar is the case on Google\u2019s Android platform having Chrome installed as the default web browser. However, the watchdog added that since its preliminary findings which were announced in November 2024, both Apple and Google have addressed some of the concerns. \u201cApple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users,\u201d said Apple spokesperson Julien Trosdorf, according to The Verge. \u201cWe have concerns with this report and believe the remedies it discusses would undermine privacy, security, and the overall user experience. We will continue to engage constructively with the CMA to best address their concerns.\u201d Google has not commented on the investigation findings released by the British watchdog CMA, so far. Earlier in 2025, due to pressure from the European Union (EU), Apple allowed third-party web browser engines starting from iOS 17.4 and onwards. However, the change is limited only to the EU-based iPhone users.\u00a0 \u201cFollowing our in-depth investigation, we have concluded that competition between different mobile browsers is not working well, and this is holding back innovation in the UK,\u201d said Margot Daly, Chair of the CMA\u2019s independent inquiry group. \u201cI welcome the CMA\u2019s prompt action to open strategic market status investigations into both Apple and Google\u2019s mobile ecosystems.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"ByZennon Kapron  ByZennon Kapron,  Contributor.  The crypto market of 2025 is distinct from the impulsive, hype-driven cycles of years past. Cryptocurrency has experienced its fair share of turmoil and triumphs over the past several years. Now, in 2025, many wonder whether the sector has truly overcome its earlier hurdles, which include rapid price swings, rug pulls, high-profile exchange failures, regulatory uncertainties and sustainability concerns. Events like FTX\u2019s collapse and other exchange implosions left retail and institutional participants questioning the integrity of crypto platforms. \u201cRug-pulls,\u201d where specific cryptocurrencies are hyped, and then founders and insiders sell quickly, leaving other investors holding the bag, have even ensnared government leaders and shaken faith in the sector. Argentina\u2019s President Javier Milei extolled the potential of a cryptocurrency called $LIBRA to support small businesses and start-ups, only to have the founders abandon it, leaving $LIBRA nearly worthless today. Despite these setbacks, governments worldwide have adopted a more nuanced approach to digital assets. Some view cryptocurrencies as an engine of financial innovation, while others regard the sector as a risk that requires stricter oversight and regulation. Meanwhile, the newly re-elected Trump administration in the United States has implemented policies that simultaneously push investors toward a more cautious (\u201crisk-off\u201d) stance through renewed tariffs, while also encouraging crypto innovation by establishing a dedicated task force and appointing a \u201cCrypto Czar.\u201d The past few years have tested crypto\u2019s resilience in ways few could have predicted. FTX\u2019s collapse in late 2022 was among the most shocking, but other high-profile exchange failures spurred calls for greater transparency, tighter governance and regulatory reform across multiple jurisdictions. Exchanges that managed to survive into 2025 have largely done so with more substantial compliance commitments, proof-of-reserves audits, and higher capital requirements, building a more robust marketplace. Regulatory approaches still vary worldwide. Europe\u2019s MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) legislation offers a clear structure for token listings, stablecoins and custodians. Hong Kong and Singapore, competing for the title of Asia\u2019s crypto capital, maintain licensing regimes aimed at legitimizing digital assets while deterring fraudulent schemes. The U.S., led by the SEC, has focused on curbing unregistered securities offerings. Still, the new Trump administration\u2019s emphasis on economic \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies has introduced an additional twist: the reintroduction of specific tariffs, which many analysts believe has created and will continue to support a more cautious investment environment. Despite, or perhaps indeed because of, this uncertainty, overall market capitalization stabilized in mid-2024 and then slowly crept down after the Trump bump wore off in early January. Notably, institutional participation continues to rise, reflecting a shift away from the \u201cWild West\u201d era of crypto and toward an ecosystem that is, in some respects, more risk-managed. Yet, investors remain divided on whether the convergence of new tariffs and America\u2019s sudden shift toward a more crypto-friendly stance will bolster or undermine confidence. In early 2025, the White House announced a series of tariffs on goods from specific trading partners, citing the need to protect domestic industries. Historically, tariffs have triggered a \u201crisk-off\u201d attitude among investors, who worry about global trade slowdowns and market volatility. This has affected equities and commodities, with some trickle-down effects on crypto prices. Paradoxically, the administration has also set up a Crypto Task Force. This move was framed as a response to calls for more precise guidelines, aiming to harmonize the approaches of federal agencies to crypto regulation. Proponents of this initiative, many of which donated heavily to Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, believe that having a dedicated oversight body will attract more institutional capital to digital assets. At the same time, skeptics argue it could concentrate regulatory power in the executive branch, creating uncertainty about how rules might be enforced. All told, the new administration\u2019s policies introduce both headwinds and potential tailwinds for digital assets. While tariffs dampen overall appetite for risk, the pro-crypto posture in Washington has renewed conversations about whether the U.S. can reclaim its position as a global leader in digital asset innovation. The skepticism once shown by banks and hedge funds has gradually eroded. By 2025, more traditional financial institutions are expected to maintain dedicated crypto trading desks, custody solutions and blockchain pilot programs. These moves reflect a growing recognition that digital assets are becoming increasingly integral to the global financial landscape. Notably, some larger companies have begun exploring tokenized assets, including tokenized bonds and fractionalized real estate. This broadening scope signals that crypto is no longer confined to speculative trading; it\u2019s evolving into a diverse and increasingly interconnected marketplace. As prominent banks partner with tech providers, they introduce robust compliance standards and risk management protocols that can alleviate lingering concerns from more cautious investors. A significant catalyst for mainstream engagement has been the expansion of Bitcoin ETFs and similar spot-based products. Following 2023, Europe, Australia and select Asian markets greenlit these instruments, removing a key barrier to entry for many potential investors. Buying a BTC ETF on a regulated stock exchange is a familiar process, appealing to those wary of managing private keys and offshore exchanges. These products also enable broader participation by integrating directly into 401(k) plans, pension funds and other traditional investment vehicles. The result? A deepening and diversifying investor pool, increased liquidity and somewhat reduced volatility, especially compared to the roller-coaster years of 2017 and 2021. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) will remain a global topic of discussion in 2025. The digital euro is being rolled out incrementally, while China\u2019s digital yuan pilot has transitioned into a nationwide rollout, particularly in cities such as Shanghai and Shenzhen. State-backed digital currencies are fundamentally distinct from decentralized cryptos, but they normalize the concept of digital wallets and frictionless online transactions. The presence of CBDCs, in turn, creates a \u201cgateway effect\u201d for those who might otherwise shy away from crypto. As businesses and consumers become accustomed to transacting in digital currency, they find it less intimidating to explore tokens such as bitcoin, ether or stablecoins. While CBDCs could diminish some of the competitive advantages of decentralization, such as censorship resistance, many believe that the two systems will coexist, serving different financial and technological niches. While speculation still grabs headlines, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) continue proving that crypto isn\u2019t just about price bets. DeFi platforms now offer products like undercollateralized lending, decentralized insurance and yield-aggregating platforms with user-friendly interfaces. For communities in emerging markets, these solutions offer cost-effective and transparent financial services that were previously inaccessible. NFTs have also grown beyond digital art collectibles. Major brands use NFTs for loyalty programs, event tickets and proof-of-ownership credentials. Supply chain verification is another emerging application of blockchain technology, ensuring authenticity and traceability in industries such as luxury goods and pharmaceuticals. These real-world use cases cement crypto\u2019s role as more than a speculative playground; it is also an infrastructure for practical innovation. Despite signs of strength, various obstacles may hinder the sustained growth of the cryptocurrency industry. The interplay of new geopolitical tensions, regulatory clampdowns and environmental critiques highlights the fragility of market sentiment. Global oversight has intensified, fueled by concerns over fraud, money laundering and consumer protection. In the U.S., the SEC\u2019s enforcement actions target unregistered securities while demanding greater disclosure from exchanges regarding custody practices. Yet the new Trump administration\u2019s approach, mainly via the Crypto Task Force, adds another layer of unpredictability. Asian regulations remain a mixed bag: Hong Kong and Singapore support regulated innovations, whereas China continues to clamp down, pushing crypto activities offshore. While comprehensive rules can foster investor trust, they also impose significant compliance costs on smaller players, potentially limiting grassroots-level innovation. Amid climate-focused policies and investor scrutiny, the energy consumption of Proof-of-Work networks, such as bitcoin, remains a lightning rod for criticism. Although renewables and more efficient mining methods have somewhat mitigated bitcoin\u2019s environmental impact, perceptions of unsustainable practices persist. This can dampen demand, especially among ESG-centric institutions. On the brighter side, many networks now utilize Proof of Stake (PoS) and Layer 2 solutions, which drastically reduce energy consumption. Ethereum\u2019s successful switch to PoS in 2022 demonstrated a path toward more eco-friendly blockchains, but bitcoin\u2019s unwavering reliance on PoW continues to fuel debates about the sector\u2019s long-term sustainability. Banks and legacy payment providers no longer dismiss crypto out of hand. Some launch their own digital tokens pegged to national currencies, particularly aimed at streamlining cross-border transactions. Others roll out fast settlement systems that rival crypto\u2019s benefits but with lower volatility and more apparent consumer protection. While this competition can drive innovation, it also narrows crypto\u2019s advantage in remittances and payments. Decentralized platforms must, therefore, continually enhance user experience, lower fees and emphasize unique attributes like global accessibility and censorship resistance to remain appealing. By 2025, the correlation between crypto and traditional markets deepened. Initially hailed as an \u201cuncorrelated\u201d hedge, digital assets have demonstrated a strong reaction to macroeconomic factors, such as interest rate hikes or heightened trade tensions triggered by the revival of U.S. tariff policies. When equity markets decline due to concerns about slower global growth, cryptocurrencies often follow suit. In contrast, emerging markets grappling with inflation or capital controls rely on stablecoins. For consumers in these regions, stablecoins provide a less volatile store of value and a more cost-effective means of remittance. Government-driven digital transformation, like tokenizing real estate deeds or corporate bonds, further cements blockchain technology into everyday economic activities. An additional 2025 trend involves corporate giants experimenting with tokenizing traditionally illiquid assets such as real estate, private equity stakes and commodities. This tokenization wave has introduced new liquidity channels, attracting global investors seeking diversification. Though some critics warn about transferring high volatility into previously stable markets, proponents argue these tokens democratize investment by enabling fractional ownership. If this tokenization trend continues, public perception of \u201ccrypto\u201d could shift away from purely bitcoin\/ether speculation. Instead, blockchain can be seen as a foundational technology for verifying ownership, automating compliance and simplifying the international trading of various assets. With stronger regulatory frameworks, institutional inflows and expanding use cases, cryptocurrency\u2019s overall demand in 2025 appears to be trending upward, albeit in a more measured and nuanced manner. Speculative mania has cooled compared to 2017 and 2021, giving way to an environment where both retail and professional investors weigh real-world utility, governance standards and ESG considerations. Still, the market navigates high-stakes obstacles. The latest tariffs imposed by the U.S. can reinforce risk-off sentiment in global markets. At the same time, the country\u2019s concurrent pro-crypto posture introduces a potentially contradictory mix of fear and opportunity. Tensions among significant economies, environmental critiques, and the looming specter of more clampdowns could stall momentum at any time. Yet the consistent push toward tokenization, DeFi, and NFT-based applications indicates that crypto continues expanding its influence, even when confronted by headwinds. On balance, many veterans believe the demand will continue to rise, supported by the new U.S. Crypto Task Force\u2019s commitment to clarify regulations. If these guidelines are implemented in a constructive manner, the sector could experience a fresh wave of institutional and retail interest. Bottom Line The crypto market of 2025 is distinct from the impulsive, hype-driven cycles of years past. It\u2019s more tightly regulated, under the watchful eye of institutions and governments, some of which, like the Trump administration, convey mixed signals through tariffs and newly formed crypto oversight bodies. Alongside these challenges, the sector boasts an ever-expanding range of tangible use cases, including DeFi lending, supply chain verification and tokenized real estate. Whether crypto demand continues to climb or plateaus will largely depend on how well the industry addresses pressing issues, including regulatory clarity, environmental impacts and competition from traditional finance. Despite these uncertainties, the gradual integration of crypto into global finance, from high-level treasury strategies to everyday consumer applications, indicates that digital assets are likely here to stay. From fresh tariffs and risk-off sentiments to forward-looking policies and the establishment of a Crypto Task Force, 2025 reflects a time of both consolidation and expansion for cryptocurrencies. While it\u2019s too soon to say if crypto will surge as it did in past bull runs, its increasing entrenchment in financial, governmental and technological spheres signals that the sector\u2019s demand trends remain dynamic, complex and, for many, undeniably promising. Rising institutional adoption, innovative applications in DeFi and NFTs, the expansion of Bitcoin ETFs and more formal regulatory frameworks worldwide are all influential. Meanwhile, the new U.S. administration\u2019s combination of tariffs and crypto-friendly initiatives reflects the market\u2019s complex, often contradictory signals. Yes. Many major banks, hedge funds and large tech firms now view digital assets as integral to their long-term strategies, offering crypto custody solutions, tokenized bond issuances and more. Ongoing regulatory clarity (including the establishment of a U.S. Crypto Task Force) has further lowered barriers to entry for big players. Clear regulations can give investors confidence and weed out bad actors, but inconsistent or stringent rules may slow innovation and discourage smaller projects. The newly appointed \u201cCrypto Czar\u201d in the U.S. aims to streamline regulatory processes, but the real-world impact remains to be seen. Absolutely. While speculative hype has cooled, user-friendly trading apps, Bitcoin ETFs and stablecoins continue drawing retail traders. Many seek an inflation hedge or a more efficient way to transfer value\u2014particularly in countries grappling with volatile fiat currencies. Yes. Singapore, Hong Kong and select EU nations have embraced proactive policies that encourage a vibrant crypto sector. Meanwhile, U.S. markets are seeing a mix of cautious sentiment from tariffs and optimism from new crypto-focused government bodies. In heavily restricted countries like China, mainstream adoption is stifled, but underground or offshore activities persist.","label":1}

Five years later, the rate of young people being diagnosed with colorectal cancer has risen swiftly, according to the American Cancer Society.

Barring collapses from both teams, Vanderbilt and Texas A&M should be playing in March Madness. The Commodores began the season with a dream start of 16-4. Since February 1, Vanderbilt is 2-5, with losses against Oklahoma, Florida, Auburn, Tennessee, and Kentucky. Besides Oklahoma, those four teams are the best in the SEC. A&M also finds themselves in a rut, losing two straight, including Saturday's loss to Tennessee. The Aggies still have plenty of chances to improve their resume with games against Vanderbilt, Florida, and Auburn. Can the Commodores pick up their first win in College Station since 2017?

The SEC continues to be a gauntlet this season. The Bulldogs are a top-25 basketball team, yet they can't even crack the top-7 within their conference. The Tide are tied for second in the SEC with Florida, as top-ranked Auburn remains in first place. After two ranked wins against Ole Miss and Texas A&M, the Bulldogs were upset by the Oklahoma Sooners on Saturday. While the loss won't derail their tournament chances, it will impact their seeding. Meanwhile, the Crimson Tide snapped their two-game losing streak with an impressive 96-83 victory over Kentucky. Good luck beating Alabama when they make over 10 3-pointers per game. With just under two weeks remaining in the regular season, many teams will be jockeying for positions before the conference tournaments.

The sheer number of games to bet on in a short time makes the NCAA tournament popular with legal sportsbook games.                                                           Grant Halverson\/NCAA Photos via Getty Images                                       hide caption  Gambling \u2014 online and in person \u2014 is more widely accessible in the U.S. than it's ever been, and the industry has the revenue to show for it. The total U.S. commercial gaming revenue profit last year was over $70 billion, according to the American Gaming Association. Americans are expected to wager an estimated $3.1 billion in legal bets on the NCAA March Madness tournament alone this year. That's even more than was bet on the February, 2025 Super Bowl, which was $1.39 billion. After a 2018 Supreme Court decision allowed for legal sports wagering outside of Nevada, dozens of states adopted the practice. It is now legal in 38 states plus the District of Columbia.  Online gambling and sports betting platforms proliferated in the wake of that decision, and mental health experts say research around addiction and gambling \u2014 and treatment for problem gambling \u2014 has not kept up with the changes to the industry. \"On your phone, money's not real,\" says Jen, a woman who struggled with gambling for years and now has more than $100,000 of debt. She asked NPR not to use her last name for fear of professional repercussions. \"It's not tangible. And so you lose sight of the fact that you've just gambled away all this real money.\" She and others interviewed for this article say platforms that facilitate legal sports betting and online casinos feel like video games. \"I could wake up in the middle of the night and gamble,\" says Jen. \"I could do it from bed. It's just so easy.\" Jen has also struggled with a substance use disorder. She says the primary difference for her between that and gambling is that gambling is worse. \"The urges come out of nowhere and the distance between you and the action is so minimal,\" she says. \"I don't have to call up a shady dealer to ask him to deliver something. I don't have to ingest anything. It's really just a matter of picking up my phone.\" Industry representatives say society is in better hands with legal gambling than illegal gambling, and that too much regulation will drive people with gambling disorder to illegal markets. \"There is a vast predatory and pervasive illegal market sitting there as a digital storefront right next door to legal operators,\" says Joe Maloney, a senior vice president for strategic communications for the American Gaming Association. That association represents the many online sportsbook companies that have sprung up as well as casinos. The illegal markets \"do not invest in responsible gaming measures,\" Maloney says. Guardrails for legal online gambling include things like forced breaks, self-exclusion options, or limiting people who have lost too much money from continuing to play, Maloney says. Part of the reason researchers say they do not have a good handle on the breadth of problem gambling in the U.S. is that no one is measuring it. \"The last time a large national study was really accepted as the prevalence rate was in 1999,\" says Michelle Malkin, Director of the Gambling Research and Policy Initiative at East Carolina University, \"which is nothing close to what we see happening in the United States or the world today.\" That study pinned the number of problem gamblers at less than 1%. Malkin is working to use existing state datasets and modeling to update these data; though she has not arrived at an exact figure, she says her research indicates the national prevalence rate of problem gambling is significantly higher. Other research has provided clues about the impact of gambling on the public. \"When you look at \u200aadult males in their early 30s you see that the legalization of gambling is related to worse mental health and more reported days of poor mental health,\" says Stephen Wu, a researcher at Hamilton College who measured mental well-being among different demographics in states before and after gambling was legalized. Other studies looking at the impact of legalization show an increase in searches for phrases that include the words \"gambling,\" and \"addiction,\" and a link between legal gambling and domestic violence. Neuroscience shows that much like substance-use disorders, gambling addictions can change the brain over time. \"\u200aYou see the response is remarkably similar,\" says Kristin Scaplen, who studies psychology and addiction at Bryant University in Rhode Island. She points to research that suggests gambling wins deliver the same kind of dopamine reward as consumption of substances like alcohol. \"You see this kind of remodeling in the brain,\" she says. Advocates for gambling restrictions say this kind of disordered thinking and behavior is what delivers profits for gambling companies. \"There's no revenue without the addicted gambler,\" says Les Bernal, who runs an advocacy group, Stop Predatory Gambling. Bernal points to an investigation from the Wall Street Journal that showed that 70 percent of the profits from one online gambling company came from less than one percent of the users. He says states partnering with this industry set up inherent conflict of interests. \"Those are the business practices that make all the money for the state,\" says Bernal. Ben Yew has experienced this firsthand. \"\u200aThere are whales and then there are just casual gamblers,\" says Yew, referring to the slang term for gamblers who bet, win and lose large sums of money. He says he personally handed over close to $1 million to gambling companies of all kinds \u2014 legal, illegal, online, brick and mortar casinos \u2014 over many years of struggling with problem gambling. Much of the money he lost was stolen from family members.                  Legal betting on sports used to be limited to places like the Westgate Las Vegas Resort & Casino, pictured here. But a 2018 Supreme Court case opened the door to phone apps that can be used for betting.                                                           Ethan Miller\/Getty Images\/Getty Images North America                                       hide caption  Among other things, he says, gambling cost him his first marriage and his relationship with his two daughters. \"\u200aMy moral center and any values that I had \u2014anytime I was in active addiction \u2014 they are completely eschewed. They sink to the deepest, dark, darkest depths of your soul,\" says Yew. \"You don't retrieve those when you're trying to chase the next win.\" After spending time incarcerated for theft, Yew is in recovery. He's hopeful he might someday reconcile with his daughters. \"\u200aI don't blame them for hating me or not wanting to speak with me,\" he says. \"I do love them now and forever.\" \"\u200aIt's not bad that we have legalized gambling,\" says Malkin, the professor and researcher who studies gambling. \"Most people can gamble in a healthy way, but we need to be taking care of and focused on the person who can't.\" Malkin and other experts say society \u2014 and the gambling industry \u2014 have failed to acknowledge the extent of this need, develop a widely available treatment for problem gambling, or adequately roll out prevention programs. \u200aExperts who treat those struggling with problem gambling say part of the work is helping individuals adopt a new mindset. \"The currency can be the ego boost,\" says Eric Webber, an addictions counselor at Caron Treatment Centers in Pennsylvania. Webber says even without money, people in active addiction often look for small ways to \"win,\" throughout the day, such as beating a stoplight or guessing a number correctly. Webber came to the work after personal experience with gambling, and says he's grateful he wasn't actively gambling when it became widely legal. \"Since the 2018 legalization of gambling, we've just seen sort of this tidal wave of issues,\" he says. Many centers like his treat gambling disorders in outpatient settings along with substance use disorders. Patients often suffer from both. Inpatient facilities that specialize in gambling are rare \u2013 fewer than five exist in the country by some estimates. In part, therapists say, that is because insurance companies are reluctant to cover inpatient treatment. But many therapists who work with those struggling with gambling point out a need for specialized treatment that differs from treating other kinds of compulsive behavior. \"You don't ingest anything,\" says Jody Bechtold, a clinician who treats gambling disorders. \"You don't just pass out because you had too much.\" Access to finances is an important consideration, says Bechtold. \"You really have to target, do they have access to money? Do they have blocking software? Do you make sure you don't have any access to your own money and your family member manages all of it so that you can't just go to an ATM and go to the casino?\" Bechtold says until insurance companies start covering inpatient treatment, it will likely be out of reach for many. \"\u200aIt's kind of an oxymoron,\" she says. \"Your finances are so devastated, but do you have $10,000 to go to rehab?\" Malkin says treatment for people who have already wrecked their lives and drained their bank accounts is not enough. Gambling is a growing problem on college campuses, she warns, which can set people up for a lifetime of struggle. \"We need to be doing the outreach and education early,\" she cautions. Industry advocates and those who seek more resources for intervention and prevention agree on one thing: without legalized gambling, there is no revenue stream for treatment. What they don't agree on is who should pay for these services, and how much should be invested. Representatives from the industry point out that states already set aside money from gambling revenue for treatment and intervention. Maloney, with the American Gaming Association, says the industry contributes $130 million for \"problem gambling services, preventions and treatments.\" Maloney asserts that gambling brings revenue \"for critical priorities.\" States, he says, can funnel as much money as they choose back into treatment. But national advocates warn treatment is underfunded, especially compared to the billions of dollars of investment that the federal government puts into resources for addiction to alcohol, tobacco and other substances. \"There's no federal funding for gambling addiction,\" says Cait Huble, spokesperson for the National Council on Problem Gambling. The group estimates the cost to society of problem gambling is $14 billion annually. \"It is several decades behind it in terms of public opinion and recognition of it as a mental health condition,\" says Huble. Her group has been advocating for legislation that would create a federal funding stream for treatment and intervention, syphoning millions from the profits of the gambling industry. Jen, the woman with more than $100,000 of debt \u2013 says none of the guardrails made a difference for her. She says she played on both legal and illegal sites, often switching between platforms. She's still working on putting her life back together, but it's complicated by the necessity of a smartphone in modern life. \"My last relapse was in December \u2013 less than three months ago,\" she says. \"I don't trust myself.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}

It took me 1:09 to complete today's NYT Mini. That\u2019s slightly longer than I\u2019d like for a non-Saturday Mini, but I\u2019m okay with the time. The Across clues were a little messy on the first pass. I was taking too long to think about the first one (which should have been pretty easy, in hindsight), I don\u2019t know jack about college football and for 8 Across, I was trying to think of a word that people might have used to call a group of babies a long time ago. I totally misread that one. Since I only had the B of what turned out to be ABS, I guessed that 1 Down was referring to PBR. Whoops! I realized that didn\u2019t make sense as soon as I had BEAMS. I was able to clear the rest of the Down words and when I got back to 1 Down, ABS made sense at that point. Fun gimmick today! See you tomorrow for more NYT Mini fun!

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"Business Insider Edition  This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Cynthia Jones, a 64-year-old retired librarian in Toledo, Ohio, who purchased several homes without a cosigner or spouse. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.          When I was in my mid-20s, I discovered that my husband had no interest in becoming a homeowner. This, along with other factors, ultimately led to our divorce.               In 1982, as a single woman, I purchased my first property for my toddler and me. Since then, I've bought and sold four homes. Now, at 68, I live in my fifth \u2014 and final \u2014 home.               I love being a homeowner because whether I use my home equity to make improvements, invest in other ventures, or simply enjoy the stability of ownership, it's mine to do with as I please.               I've also passed this lesson on to my daughter, who happens to be single, too.               Before turning 30, my daughter also purchased her first property alone, without a spouse. Prior to that, she earned her graduate degree. Now, at 44, she's enjoying traveling and her career.               We're two women embracing single life, traveling, and making the most of our future.               I have always encouraged single women to build wealth through homeownership and real-estate investing. Owning property is one of the few investments that allows you to retain the asset while still making money. In contrast, with investments like stocks, you must sell to realize any profit.               Owning a home could also have developmental benefits. Some research has shown that children who live in a family-owned home may fare better in school, among other things. I have seen some of these benefits firsthand.               Homeownership wasn't the sole reason my husband and I got a divorce, but it was, as I say, the straw that broke the camel's back.               In 1981, I was living in Toledo, Ohio, in a townhouse with two bedrooms and one bathroom that my ex-husband and I rented for around $500 a month.               At the time, I was considering setting up a private music studio to teach violin lessons from home, which required more space. The apartment was under about 1,000 square feet and felt cramped. Plus, when you share walls with neighbors, you hear them, and they hear you. There was also no laundry facility in the complex, so we had to go to a local laundromat.               With a young child and the possibility of expanding our family, I realized it was the right time to stop renting and start building equity in a place of our own.               While owning a home is a core value for me, my ex-husband never wanted the responsibility of homeownership. He believed it would be too costly. My counterpoint was that while there are expenses associated with owning a home, you can't build equity in an apartment, pay it off, or pass it down.               Buying my first home after the divorce was surprisingly easy. Fortunately, my former boss's wife, a real-estate agent, knew an elderly man who was looking to sell his condo. He offered seller financing, and the process went smoothly with no issues.               In 1982, I paid $28,000 for his two-bedroom, one-bathroom condo. The master bedroom and closet were spacious, and my daughter was thrilled to have her own room. I also enjoyed a nice balcony overlooking a pond, which was a peaceful place to relax.               We lived in the condo for eight years before selling it for around $35,000. Although it was just a starter home, I was thrilled to finally own something. And now, even after all these years, my daughter and I still talk about the memories we made there.               After my divorce, I remained single and returned to school to study fine arts and business. My focus was solely on my education and raising my daughter.               Over the years, I purchased four more homes, with each sale helping to finance the next. I bought my final home \u2014 a four-bedroom, two-bathroom house \u2014 for $187,000 in 2019. It's now valued at nearly $300,000, according to Realtor.com.               In the future, it will need a few repairs, so some of my equity will go toward that, and the rest will be saved, perhaps in a high-yield savings account for emergencies. That's the beauty of homeownership \u2014 while real estate goes through up-and-down periods, over time, you're generally building equity.               In 2013, my daughter purchased her own home in Toledo for $130,000 \u2014 a four-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bath house in the same neighborhood as mine. My 90-year-old mother and my nephew are currently leasing it. Last year, a house across the street from hers sold for $313,000, so I estimate her home is now valued at around $300,000.               My father passed last August, so we're transitioning my mother to my home, which has a first-floor bedroom and bathroom. Although my daughter's house has a chair lift, my mom is reaching a point where even that could become a challenge. It's safer for her to be here with us.               In this situation, owning a home is definitely a benefit compared to living in an apartment because we can adjust or renovate it to suit her needs. Some apartments have accessibility issues. While some complexes are required by law to make accommodations, this isn't always the case. Even if a landlord agrees, renters can be expected to pay for the upgrades.               My daughter plans to sell her house, and then we'll all be living together in my home. We are joining the ranks of others enjoying a multi-generational household.               Our neighborhood is fantastic. Everyone knows each other and looks out for one another. Plus, we're lucky to be right next to a park that offers plenty of nature. This will definitely be our forever home.               I've made many financial blunders in my life \u2014 but owning homes hasn't been one of them.               My only regret in my homeownership journey is that I sold my previous properties instead of keeping them as rentals. I'd be in an excellent financial position now and could have passed that portfolio on to my daughter.               It would have also helped with retirement. The rental income would have served as my primary source of retirement income, alongside other sources.               A friend of mine, who also bought her first home as a single mother, has paid it off and also owns a paid-off investment property. Now, in retirement, she's reaping the rewards of those smart investments.               Many years ago, I obtained my real-estate license, but due to various circumstances, I didn't pursue using it at the time.               As part of my \"encore career\" or second act, I plan to return to real estate \u2014 not just for income, but to educate women about the benefits of homeownership and investing in real property.               I've kept up with reading about the real-estate market, and I'm aware that single women are outpacing men in homeownership. I think it's because women like me are no longer waiting for marriage or a partner to invest in their own homes. I think, in many cases, they are thinking long-term about securing their retirement and building wealth.               More women understand the financial benefits of homeownership, and as I always say, you'll always need a place to live \u2014 so why not make it something you own?

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"03\/29 \u2014 2025   by   abduzeedo     Field Notes debuts a new notebook inspired by 1950s sign design, featuring bold colors and iconic graphic design details. Field Notes has long built its brand around craftsmanship and nostalgia. With its latest Quarterly Edition, \u201cThe Chicago Look,\u201d the Chicago-based company leans into graphic design history, channeling the energy and optimism of post-WWII signage into a new 6\u00d78\u201d format. For designers and creatives, it\u2019s a tactile tribute to a golden era of visual communication. The edition is inspired by the Beverly Sign Co., a now-defunct outfit that made its mark in the 1950s and \u201960s. Known for panelized layouts, bold letterforms, and high-contrast palettes, Beverly Sign Co. helped shape what came to be called the \u201cChicago Look.\u201d It was a style that didn\u2019t just stay local \u2014 it influenced commercial sign painters across the U.S. Field Notes\u2019 team discovered this design legacy through\u00a0The Golden Era of Sign Design by Kelsey Dalton McClellan and Andrew McClellan. The book archives original sketches, notes, and swatches that guided painters \u2014 also known as \u201cwall dogs\u201d \u2014 as they hand-lettered storefronts and billboards. These hand-drawn artifacts, rich with penciled-in feedback and vibrant color studies, served as the launchpad for this edition\u2019s visual identity. To capture the spirit of those original proofs, Field Notes brought in the McClellans and fellow sign painter Bob Behounek to design two covers that echo the look and feel of an in-progress sign. The covers are printed on Westrock Tango C1S 16pt stock, featuring diagonal color swatches and textured notes \u2014 a direct reference to the original documentation used by sign painters. Each notebook includes 64 pages of Domtar Lynx Opaque paper, with a light-blue grid printed in soy-based ink. The decision to scale up from the standard size to a larger 6\u00d78\u201d format gives designers more room to sketch, ideate, and build \u2014 a functional choice that also elevates the presence of the historic reference. At $14.95 for a 2-pack, \u201cThe Chicago Look\u201d is more than a stationery release \u2014 it\u2019s a mini design archive. Subscribers to Field Notes\u2019 Quarterly Edition also receive a 2.25\u201d \u201cWall Dogs Forever\u201d pin and a postcard of one of the covers as a full-sized, hand-painted sign now installed at Field Notes HQ. In a time when much of graphic design lives on screens, this collection reconnects creatives with physical process and historical context. It celebrates the analog precision of mid-century sign painters \u2014 those who shaped cityscapes with brushes, not pixels. For designers looking to get inspired by the roots of visual branding, this edition delivers a rare mix of design history, material beauty, and functionality.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"ByJames Morris  ByJames Morris,  Contributor.  The Deepal S07 is one of the better-looking mid-sized electric SUVs. Barely a week goes by now without a new Chinese automaker launching into Europe. The latest to join the market is Changan, one of the most venerable. In fact, in a former guise this was the first company in China to manufacture automobiles. Now Changan is entering the EU and UK with not one but three brands. The first vehicle arrives on the Deepal marque. The Deepal S07 is, unsurprisingly, a medium-sized SUV \u2013 the most popular car format. But does it have an edge sto stand out from the crowd? The first notable thing about the Deepal S07 and Changan in general is that the company\u2019s global design center is not in China. It has been located in Turin, Italy since 2001. For this reason, Changan\u2019s global design director Bertrand Bach claims the Deepal S07 has a European aesthetic, and I\u2019d tend to agree with that. Although the angular nose is now quite common in pure BEV designs now, the Deepal S07\u2019s implementation is quite striking. It\u2019s not exactly aggressive but certainly purposeful. The side profile looks a bit like a coupe, but the rear passenger space is not compromised. Like so many recent SUVs, the Deepal S07 has a coupe look with a slantier back than a regular vehicle in this class. However, there\u2019s a bit of design trickery here, as the trim line from the C-pillar to the rear slopes but there is some roofline above this, meaning the rear is more upright than it looks. It\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve seen this design method \u2013 the Smart #3 uses it too. But that doesn\u2019t stop it being a good idea for making a car look sportier. The interior has a premium feel about it. Although the Deepal S07 is therefore attractive on the outside, its best features are inside. The interior is still very modern but also uses a pleasant combination of materials. This gives the car one of the most premium finishes I\u2019ve seen on a Chinese car in this class. Deepal has chosen to follow Tesla by not providing any dashboard instrumentation. However, unlike the American brand, a head-up display is provided, which offers plenty of information. One thing lacking, annoyingly, is speed limit information, so if you missed the signs you will need to look down at the satnav on the main infotainment screen to confirm what the prevailing maximum legal speed is. But otherwise, this is a great alternative to a dashboard display, and I really wish Tesla had this as a factory option. Rear passenger space is excellent in the Deepal S07. The amount of space for rear-seat passengers is commendable, too. Despite the coupe look, the car ceiling doesn\u2019t start dropping until far back, so the headroom is good for adults. There is a lot of leg room too, more than you would expect looking at the car from outside. Rear passengers also get their own digital controls over air conditioning, and if there is no middle-seat passenger the back can be pulled forward to make a comfortable armrest with integrated cupholders. The rear luggage space is sufficient if not overly generous. Rear luggage space is decent, but not as surprising as the rear passenger space. The basic rear cargo space is 445 liters. If you drop the rear seats forward the space expands to 1,385 liters. However, if you want to remove the parcel shelf you have to drop the seats forward, and you can\u2019t get it back in with them back up. There\u2019s a sizeable frunk with 125 liters, enough for a large bag, so overall there is plenty of luggage capacity. The Deepal S07 isn\u2019t particularly powerful by EV standards, with \u201cjust\u201d 217hp and 320Nm of torque. Even in Sport mode, it will take 7.9 seconds to reach 62mph, which was fast in the internal combustion era but many BEVs are a lot faster now. Changan\u2019s global design director Bertrand Bach also told me that the suspensions setup is different for Europe. This is softer for the Chinese market, but harder for Europeans, who prefer a more engaging drive. In my short test experience, it seems about right for the UK. There is still sufficient softness for rougher surfaces, but some responsiveness for a little bit of fun. The Deepal S07 is not that fast for an EV but it's pleasant to drive. If the performance isn\u2019t particularly special, the range and charging capabilities are also mediocre. The 80kWh (net) battery delivers 295 miles in the WLTP cycle, which is about as expected for an SUV in this class (although the Tesla Model Y goes further with a similar battery). During my test driving, which comprised about 45 miles, in a variety of modes and at a variety of speeds including close to 100mph on a German autobahn, the car achieved close to 3 miles per kWh. That would give it around 240 miles of range in the real world, which is reasonable. However, DC charging only goes to 93kW, which is way behind the leading edge these days. This means it will take 35 minutes to go from 30% to 80% charge. That\u2019s not the end of the world and won\u2019t preclude long-distance driving. But there are a lot of competitors in this size class, including the Leapmotor C10, XPENG G6, and of course the Tesla Model Y. Changan is suggesting a starting price of \u20ac45,000, which could mean it arrives in the UK at under the magic \u00a340,000. Although the Deepal S07 is a good-looking example of the genre, both inside and out, it\u2019s up against some stiff competition. Although the Deepal S07 will be the first Changan vehicle on sale in Europe, it will soon be joined by eight models in three years. Alongside Deepal, there will be Changan-branded models and the company\u2019s luxury marque, AVATR. Changan is also not just releasing BEVs. There will be REEVs (range extending EVs) and hybrids in its lineup. There is a trend in China towards PHEVs with long electric ranges, and Changan talked about having 200km of all-electric capability alongside 1,000km with fossil fuel. The Changan E07 is like a luxury pickup-coupe combo vehicle. One of the most interesting vehicles on show at the launch was the Changan E07, which defies categorization, although it has echoes of the Tesla Cybertruck in some respects. Externally, it looks like a huge four-door coupe (it is 5m long), but it has some unusual tricks up its sleeves. The rear is like an enclosed pickup bed. Rather than having a hinged covering, the glass slides up and over the vehicle, a bit like the blind of a Cybertruck, except it\u2019s transparent and solid. What remains of the tailgate then hinges downwards to provide level access. Initially, this rear space is separated from the rear of the E07 by the rear seats and a glass barrier, but the barrier can be retracted and the seats dropped forward, making a huge space. The front seats can also be reclined, and if you remove their headrests, these seats can be level with the rear cargo space too. This could make a big area for sleeping, for example. The passenger side also has its own infotainment screen that flips down from the ceiling, so the front-seat passenger could watch screen-based media while reclining luxuriously. This is a unique set of features that might be too radical for the mass market, but it\u2019s certainly a bold and innovative design. My first experience of the Changan brand was driving a pickup from the company in Saudi Arabia, so it\u2019s fitting that the E07 is sort of a pickup. That car was all about being a robust vehicle for a low cost, but the E07 is much more luxurious in intention, and much more interesting. AVATR is Changan's luxury brand. The biggest focus of luxury from Changan is its AVATR brand, however. It even offers exclusive \u201cRoyal Editions\u201d and a 0 Series limited edition, created in partnership with fashion designers such as the 012 created in partnership with Kim Jones, Creative Director of Dior Homme and Artistic Director of Fendi Women\u2019s. This is a special version of the AVATR 12. Similarly, there is an 011 based on the AVATR 11, created with Givenchy\u2019s Creative Director Matthew Wiliams. But to kick off its European expansion, Changan is starting with the mainstream Deepal S07, as part of a plan to enter at least 10 European markets by the end of 2025. The first four are Norway, Germany, The Netherlands and the UK. The days are gone when Chinese automakers were just about being cheap. The latest releases have plenty of quality and technology to offer, too. We\u2019re in for an interesting few years in the car world.","label":0}

The TECNO Camon 40 Premier 5G feels like a sleeper hit, offering great performance and a ton of AI features in a phone that feels like it should cost more than it does. There are some shortcomings and odd choices, but the Camon 40 Premier is a solid phone that won't disappoint, especially if you live outside North America. Fantastic battery life and charging speed Display is bright and smooth at 144Hz Gaming performance is quite good Full AI suite with easy access to features Great camera system Customizable button is a nice addition Haptics could be a bit better Ella feels half-baked Back feels plasticy Awkward fingerprint sensor placement No wireless charging  Why you can trust Android Central     Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.  The TECNO Camon 40 Premier is one of the latest phones from a company you may not have heard of. It's the result of the company's relentless pursuit to bring high-end experiences to lower price points and markets, and it seems to hit the mark. The phone uses a newer MediaTek chip primed for AI performance, which is smart because the Camon 40 Premier comes with a host of AI features to take advantage of. Beyond the software, the phone has a very capable camera system that incorporates the company's latest imaging advancements, and the battery life and charging specs far surpass those of many flagship phones in North America. The TECNO Camon 40 Premier 5G feels like a full package despite some shortcomings and questionable (yet understandable) decisions.  The TECNO Camon 40 Premier was announced alongside the rest of the Camon 40 series during MWC 2025 on March 4, 2025. The phone features a single configuration with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It also comes in black and green colorways. As for pricing and availability, TECNO hasn't revealed too much at the moment, but the phone is not sold in North America. However, it will be available in other regions, including Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Europe. The Camon 30 Premier started at a price of around \u20b929,499, which is just under $350, so it stands to reason the Camon 40 Premier could cost somewhere in the same ballpark and maybe a bit more. Category TECNO Camon 40 Premier OS HiOS 15 (Android 15) Software updates 5 years, 3 OS versions Chipset MediaTek Dimensity 8520 Ultimate RAM 12GB Storage 256GB (non expandable) Display 6.67-inches, OLED, 1.5K (1260 x 2800), 144Hz Rear Camera 1 50MP wide, Sony LYT-701, OIS Rear Camera 2 50MP ultrawide Rear Camera 3 50MP periscope, 3X Front Camera 50MP wide Battery 5,100mAh Charging 70W wired Protection Gorilla Glass 7i, IP68\/69 Dimensions 161 x 75 x 7.7mm Weight 193g Colors Galaxy Black, Emerald Lake Green  For a phone that costs less than $600, the TECNO Camon 40 Premier has a lot going for it. It sits in a weird but compelling space of phones that come with flagship features and performance but sub-flagship prices. This is a space occupied by phones like the Pixel 9 and OnePlus 13R, and the Camon 40 Premier emulates this fairly well. The hardware is a big part of what makes this a great phone. The display is a 6.67-inch AMOLED that looks great, although it doesn't blow me away. It's plenty bright, the color profile is nicely tuned so that it's not oversaturated, and the 144Hz refresh rate makes scrolling and animations smooth as butter. Part of this has to do with the MediaTek Dimensity 8530 chip powering the phone. While it's an upper-midrange chipset, I have no complaints about performance. Nearly everything you do on this phone is executed quickly and effortlessly, which should come as no surprise for a chip that falls just under the flagship 9000-series chips.  This extends to gaming as well. One of my favorite games to play Honkai: Star Rail, which can be pretty taxing on a phone when played at the higher settings. Usually a phone will default to the settings it thinks it can handle, and the Camon 40 Premier was already set to \"High\" when I started up the game. I decided that wasn't enough, so I turned things up to the highest graphics settings and at 60fps instead of the default 30fps. Surprisingly (or not), the phone is able to keep up just fine, and I did not notice much in the way of stuttering or massive frame rate drops.  The software experience overall is pretty solid, even if HiOS isn't my favorite Android skin. It runs Android 15 out of the box, and you'll get some of the more common Android flourishes that we see in phones these days, such as the separated notification shade and quick panel. The smart panel is great for multitasking, while the Dynamic Port gives you a Dynamic Island-like (albeit fairly limited) experience. However, I can't really talk about a new phone in 2025 without mentioning AI, especially as it's a big focus for this phone. TECNO recently announced its grand plans for TECNO AI, its suite of features that it's bringing to its smartphone portfolio to help bridge the gap between the $1000 phones of the world and the more affordable and accessible phones. What's great is that TECNO makes its AI very present for people who want to use it.  When you first turn on the Camon 40 Premier, you're taken through the setup process via TECNO's AI assistant, Ella. It's an early introduction to the phone's relationship with AI and gets you prepared for what's to come. Once set up, swiping to the left of the home screen will unveil an AI hub of sorts called Zero Screen, where you can access a suite of TECNO AI features. Up top is Ella Briefing. Not to be confused with Samsung's Now Brief (although at least part of the idea is similar), it's a helpful \"brief\" up top to summarize and remind you of calendar events, notifications, and more. TECNO fit a ton of AI tools into the Camon 40 Premier, which are pretty useful. There's also quite an abundance of AI tools you have access to, and while you'll easily find a lot of them throughout the UI, like AI Studio in the Gallery app, the Zero Screen puts them all pretty much at your fingertips and makes it easy for you to find use cases for them. This includes creating AI-generated art using texts or drawings, translating from images or while in a conversation, summarizing documents or creating them from photos, and more. For the most part, these features are pretty well-baked, and TECNO's AI feels like a pretty mature offering. Accessing the settings for TECNO AI feels very comparable to Galaxy AI on a Samsung phone, and many features are quite similar.  Going back to the idea of easy access, TECNO has implemented an Action Button of sorts called the One-Tap Button. Interestingly, tapping it once doesn't actually do anything, but you can customize the double-tap to open any app or perform certain functions like muting the ringer. A long press of the button will evoke the Ella assistant, which is a nice alternative to using the power button, something that other Android OEMs (looking at you, Samsung) have defaulted to. I love the added functionality of the button, and I hope to see something more like this on other Android phones.  AI also makes its way into the camera, and the 50MP triple camera system is surprisingly good. TECNO has tuned the camera so that it can take better images in low-light conditions and also better reproduce more skin tones. In my experience, I've been able to take plenty of respectable photos. It's not the best, but it's quite good for this price range, and I doubt anyone would be disappointed in the camera. I love that the Camon 40 Premier has a telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom, something I feel is still pretty uncommon at this price point. It does well during the day, with photos taken at 6x coming out pretty crisp, although the sensor struggles a bit at night. You can also take images at a moment's notice with FlashSnap, which can capture photos with a very high shutter speed while keeping the image crisp with reduced noise. So not only can it keep you from missing a moment, but it can also capture moments automatically based on the scene, which is pretty useful. Finally, you'll be happy to know that battery life is superb. The 5,100mAh battery keeps the phone going all day, and I've been able to average about 7 hours or more of screen-on time. The 70W charging can also top up the phone in no time at all, with the phone going from 1-100% in just over 30 minutes. Take that, Samsung!  The TECNO Camon 40 Premier is a pretty solid phone, thanks to its IP68 and IP69 water and dust resistance ratings. Unfortunately, it doesn't feel as solid as it is. The back panel, which has a fairly uninspired design despite the brightly colored green, feels pretty cheap in hand. I often just stick to the included case, which is much grippier and still features the same color. I also found myself a bit put off by the amount of bloatware on the phone after setting it up. You'll likely spend quite a bit of time uninstalling various apps you may or may not have heard of or just don't want on your phone. And speaking of things you may not want on your phone, TECNO's AI is mostly pretty well-rounded, but Ella feels like a lesser version of Gemini. Don't get me wrong, I think it's commendable that Ella even exists, as one of the biggest benefits of using Ella over other assistants is that it uses more local languages for better accessibility among developing and developed regions. That said, despite Ella being integrated with Gemini, it just feels slower and doesn't display information in the same coherent way I would get with Gemini. For example, I asked Ella and Gemini about measles symptoms and if I should be concerned about contracting it due to the recent outbreak. Ella slowly spat out the information at me while Gemini relayed the information in a very clean manner, even creating clear lists within the app.  Also, TECNO has decided to integrate DeepSeek R1 into Ella, which is a curious decision. As a Chinese-based company, it makes sense to use the newest AI model, especially after it recently went pretty viral. However, given the privacy concerns, anyone outside of China may want to refrain from using it. Fortunately, TECNO lets you choose when to use DeepSeek R1. When opening Ella, there's a very prominent DeepSeek R1 button that you can press to toggle the model on or off. It's nice that the option is there, even if I don't plan to use it. Even better, you still have the option to use Gemini instead of Ella if you prefer. Unfortunately, that doesn't apply to the Ella One-Tap Button shortcut, but you can still set Gemini as the double-tap option to open the app (although it doesn't automatically enable voice input).  A more minor issue I have with the TECNO Camon 40 Premier is the lack of wireless charging. It's not a particularly big deal, as wireless charging is still not commonly found on midrange phones. Plus, the 70W charging more than makes up for its absence, but it is always nice to have the option. Lastly, the in-display fingerprint sensor works quickly, but like the Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 and Honor 200 Pro it's just way too low on the display, making it a bit awkward to use unless you're holding the phone in a specific way. Not a deal breaker, but definitely an annoyance.  For a phone at this price point, there are a number of similarly-priced cheap Android phones. The Pixel 9a is still very much new and only $499 despite its flagship-level Tensor G4 chipset. It is capable of many of the same AI features as the flagship Pixel 9 series, just at a fraction of the cost. That said, its hardware specs aren't nearly as robust, with slower charging, less RAM, and a lower refresh rate display. Plus, as of writing, the phone isn't on store shelves yet after it was delayed. The Moto G Power 2025 is another contender in a similar price bracket as the Camon 40 Premier. It offers great value for the price and is a beautifully designed phone that features a vegan leather finish, great battery life, wireless charging, and an IP68\/69 rating for protection. However, it has a less impressive MediaTek chip and is lacking int he AI department, making this a much less exciting phone than the Camon.  You should buy this if... You shouldn't buy this if... The Camon 40 Premier 5G is feels like it's TECNO's version of a Pixel. It's a fantastic midrange phone that has all the makings of a good flagship. The MediaTek chip is more than enough for what the phone is trying to accomplish, and the AI suite feels very comprehensive, even if some of its implementation could be improved. Despite the lack of wireless charging and questionable choices with fingerprint sensor placement and selection of AI models, battery life and great camera quality make up for any shortcomings the phone may have, of which there are few. And while it's not sold in North America, the TECNO Camon 40 Premier 5G is a phone you should consider buying if it's in your market.   A premier experience The Camon 40 Premier 5G is a great phone that has a lot of flagship potential but at a fraction of the cost. Impressive specs and a ton of AI features make this a great phone for anyone looking to save some money.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"   Cool Hunting\u00ae                A selection of the exhibitions we\u2019re eager to see in one of the most exciting areas of Milan Design Week The Porta Venezia Design District, established in 2023, has since confirmed itself as a reference point within Milan\u2019s Design Week. In its inaugural year, the district hosted 25 installations and attracted approximately 40,000 visitors. By 2024, these numbers had grown to 45 installations and over 60,000 visitors. What\u2019s peculiar here is the coexistence of established brands and emerging realities, some of which give a sense of discovery that has been long lost in other Milanese design districts.\u00a0 For the 2025 edition, the district adopts the theme \u201cNo Boundaries Design,\u201d inspired by the ideas and practice of designer and architect Eileen Gray. It might seem like an obvious design theme. Still, given the international situation, this idea seems more than necessary, and it reminds us of how urgent it is to cancel physical and ideal thresholds.\u00a0 Visitors to the Porta Venezia Design District during Fuorisalone 2025 can anticipate a rich array of installations and exhibitions. \u201cThis Way\u201d with \u0160koda Elroq and Marcantonio Conceived by Italian artist Marcantonio, the \u0160koda installation unfolds in an environment where sculptures and spatial interventions shape a setting that feels suspended between the real and the imagined. The space will create an imaginary fairy-tale-like adventure between sculptures of animals and surreal landscapes. Location: Via Palestro 14, Milan \u201cMaking the Invisible Visible\u201d with Google Google returns to Milan with \u201cMaking the Invisible Visible,\u201d an installation that explores how abstract ideas take physical form. Set within Garage 21, the exhibition is a collaboration between Google Design Studio and artist Lachlan Turczan, known for his work with light, water, and perception. The journey is composed entirely of sculpted light. Using large-scale optics and mist, the installation forms volumetric spaces where light appears to have weight and texture. Visitors will enjoy experiencing how ideas evolve into physical objects through emotion, intention, and craft. Location: Via Archimede 26, Milan \u201cPoetica\u201d with WonderGlass and Calico Wallpaper This installation shows how glass and paper can carry memory and imagination, combining material and craft in a quiet, layered narrative. \u201cPoetica\u201d takes inspiration from the relationships between materials and stories, gestures, and the life of each object. The atmosphere promises to be suspended and poetic. At the same time, objects will shift, and the edges between form and function become less distinct. Glass and paper are not just mediums but materials that carry history, legacy, craft, pottery, and fragility.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"BySal Gilbertie  BySal Gilbertie,  Contributor.  Large bobbin of thick orange copper wire in light spacious warehouse of contemporary equipment ... More production plant extreme closeup Copper is a bellwether commodity for the long-term health of the economy; higher copper prices could be signaling that the global economy will be getting stronger. Remarkably prevalent throughout the economy, copper has always been a good predictor of economic growth. In fact, commodities traders and economists call it \u201cDoc Copper\u201d because it tends to forecast fairly accurately the health of the long-term global economy. Copper prices are currently taking the spotlight in commodities markets because they just made new all-time highs in the United States. This most recent price strength is primarily because the threat of tariffs by President Donald Trump has copper users buying ahead of possible tariff impositions, which in turn has caused the global price of copper to rise as well. Copper prices had already been in a long-term uptrend because copper demand is consistently projected to rise faster than projected production for years to come. Unexpected problems with copper mines around the world began to accelerate the trend in rising copper prices last year, with prices establishing a record high in May 2024. Copper prices have continued to climb to new highs again in March 2025, turbocharged by more mining problems, tariff threats, and perhaps, most significantly, the macro changes in the global economy brought about by shifts in U.S. policies under the Trump Administration. Copper is used in everything from building materials, electric generation, electronic products, automobiles, transportation equipment, industrial machinery, and a myriad of consumer products too numerous to even categorize. The fact is, many of copper\u2019s uses are for things that take large investments of time and capital in order to produce. Think data centers, power plants, semiconductor manufacturing facilities and automobiles, to name just a few. Therein lies the secret to copper\u2019s ability to predict the long-term health of the economy. The things that create demand for copper require long periods of time for planning, development, and actual production. The lead time to plan, permit, build, and bring to operational capacity things like powerplants, auto, battery, semiconductor and building materials manufacturing facilities, plus other large scale copper consuming projects, is quite substantial. Once business executives make these decisions and put them into motion, there is usually no stopping the economic momentum created by their implementation. It is because of this that copper markets are such good predictors of future economic activity and the general health of the overall economy. Copper markets look past any short-term blips in markets (and the economy) to the effects created by long-term commitments of large scale businesses and industries. Many people, including this author, believe there will be short-term economic fallout from the pullback in government spending related to the activities of the Department of Government Efficiency. It would not be a surprise if a swoon in the stock market, and perhaps across all asset classes in general, happens in the not too distant future. But this would come as the result of a cutback in government spending that is currently categorized by Administration officials as either waste, fraud, or non-essential in nature. Taken at face value, that type of spending is superficial economic support, not the real support provided by enormous capital projects of the types mentioned above. Copper markets seem to be signaling right now, by virtue of record high prices, that the new world order into which we are entering is good for copper consumption, and therefore the global economy as a whole. A cursory look at just a few major upcoming shifts in the global economic and geopolitical landscape dramatically reveals the potential for enormous growth in copper demand. European economies are about to implement massive investments in military spending in a reformulation of NATO capabilities, which will likely stimulate all sorts of economic growth, let alone copper demand, across both Europe and the entire globe. At some point there will be at least a partial post-war rebuild of Ukraine, which will also provide enormous economic stimulus. Perhaps the most significant of all factors could be the steadily multiplying number of announced massive capital commitments into the United States for the building of new manufacturing plants for semiconductors, cell phones, automobiles, research and development plants, and more \u2014 all in response to Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d focus. These are long-term, multiyear projects that will create very real jobs, economic growth, and a huge increase in demand for copper. If only a fraction of anticipated future European NATO spending, Ukraine postwar rebuilding, and the currently announced public commitments of large scale capital spending projects in the U.S. come to fruition over the next decade, demand for copper will be enormous. All of this is driven by U.S. policy that seems like it will be supportive to copper markets for years to come.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"ByMichael Foster  ByMichael Foster,  Contributor.  Different yield and maturities for bonds and interest on stock exchange screen. Over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve seen a quiet trend in investing\u2014and today we\u2019re going to tap into it with two funds with near 10% dividends. That\u2019s right: enough to pay you back just shy of 10% of your initial buy a year in dividends alone. What\u2019s more, these two income plays\u2014closed-end funds, to be precise\u2014have been around for nearly a century, with one dating from 1927 and the other having launched in 1929. That last date, of course, is notorious, as it heralded the start of the worst market crash in history. I bring these two CEFs up now because their long institutional memory gives them a level of reliability that few other funds can match. And there\u2019s something else that favors both of them now, too\u2014that quiet shift I mentioned earlier. I\u2019m talking about the move from growth stocks to value stocks that\u2019s started to pick up momentum in recent months. We can catch a hint of that when we look at the performance of the large caps in the Dow Jones Industrial Average compared to small caps, as shown below by their benchmark index funds: the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF Trust (DIA), in orange below, and the small-cap-focused iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), in purple: Large Caps Outperform That nicely sets the table for our two centenarian funds. The General American Investors Company is the oldest of our two CEFs, but not by much. It\u2019s been around since 1927 and holds reliable cash cows like Republic Services (RSG), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A). The fund has delivered an annualized return of 8.9% over the past decade, as of this writing. It\u2019s caught our attention now because, at my CEF Insider service, one of the things we look for is a fund with what I like to call \u201cdiscount momentum.\u201d That\u2019s where a CEF\u2019s discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of the fund\u2019s underlying portfolio) is still wide but is slowly moving toward par. And that\u2019s the setup we have with GAM now. Take a look. GAM Discount to NAV Currently, GAM trades at a massive 13.3% discount, as you can see above, and that discount has been shrinking over the last year as market volatility prompts more investors to favor value over growth. In the past year, GAM has also paid out a 9.3% dividend, which is a massive amount of income for one fund. Now it is true, that most of the fund\u2019s income is paid out in one big yearly special dividend, so you\u2019ll have to hold on to the fund for a full year to be guaranteed the full payout. But that\u2019s a good thing: At CEF Insider, we see funds as something to be held for the long term. Our second fund, the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX) was launched just a couple years after GAM, in 1929. That, of course, sent it headlong into the biggest market crash of them all, and the Great Depression. But that experience was the start of the fund\u2019s build-up of the institutional memory that still helps guide its decisions today. That\u2019s a big part of the reason why we bought ADX in one of our first issues of CEF Insider, back in July 2017. Since then, it has delivered a 193% total return for us, as of this writing, showing its long-term mettle. ADX and GAM take similar approaches, with Microsoft, Alphabet and Apple being common top positions, but ADX also has a large holding of NVIDIA (NVDA), which is part of the reason why the fund has posted a bigger \u201cNAV return\u201d (or the performance of its underlying portfolio, including dividends collected) over the last decade. (ADX\u2019s total NAV return is in orange below.) ADX Outperforms GAM ADX\u2019s strategy isn\u2019t too risky, though, as it emphasizes investing in high-quality, large-cap companies, ensuring both growth potential and dividend reliability. Plus, its total dividend yield of 10.9% for 2024, combined with a relatively low management fee (for a CEF) of only 0.61%, makes ADX one of the cheaper CEFs on the fee front. On average, these funds have fees around 2% on average. What\u2019s unusual about ADX is that it has outperformed the market over the last decade and, over the last couple of years, the gap between its profits and those of the S&P 500\u2014shown by the performance of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), in orange below, has grown wider: ADX Outperforms SPY ADX should trade at a premium for delivering these gains, yet it sports at an 11.4% discount as I write this. That means there\u2019s upside as this \u201csecret\u201d income monster becomes more widely known. The move from growth to value, which we discussed with GAM above, should also help ADX move on to more people\u2019s radar. At this point, you might be wondering which fund is ideal: the cheaper GAM or the higher-performing ADX? Ultimately, what matters with CEFs is that we combine the best funds in different asset classes\u2014and funds with different investment strategies\u2014while maintaining a high level of quality among our picks. That way, when one falters due to a selloff, you can rebalance toward that dip-buying opportunity as another CEF outperforms. CEFs are particularly useful for this kind of rebalancing due to their high dividends (yields average around 8% as I write this). You\u2019ll not only compound your returns by following this approach\u2014you\u2019ll build up a healthy income stream over time, too.

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"ByAlex Lazarow  ByAlex Lazarow,  Senior Contributor.  An aerial shot of Brickell Key, with downtown cityscape. SuperReturn has long been a bellwether for the state of private markets, but last week\u2019s U.S. focused fundraising event in Miami marked a cautious shift. The exuberance of the past few years, characterized by high valuations, rapid deal velocity, and a focus on momentum-driven has given way to a more measured approach. Limited partners are prioritizing simple benchmarks like Distributions to Paid-In (DPI)\u2014realized returns over paper gains. In this piece we explore five reflections from the conference, and the important impacts they will have to the VC and fintech ecosystem.  After the 2021 tech crash, limited partners faced a denominator effect. Their public market positions were meaningfully below their private allocations because of stock price declines. They were thus unable to further allocate to alternatives since their target portfolio was out of whack. 2021 created a reversal. As Spencer Punter of DCVC explained during a panel, while public valuations have come back, private investments have not given off sufficient DPI creating a different denominator issue - LPs simply did not have sufficient capital to invest in alternatives. The appropriate portfolio \u201crebalancing\u201d strategy is not necessarily clear. Some argued that drastic efforts to reduce overallocation in private investments by significantly reducing or stopping new commitments, could potentially be more damaging than a continued overallocation. As investors continue to wrestle with this effect, one thing is certain: liquidity is now a top priority. This is why so many LPs and investors are focused on exits. There may be some good news here. On the fintech front, Klarna has filed for its IPO, which according to some estimation could be worth at least $15 billion. This would be an initial recovery from its nadir when the company faced ~85% value plunge in 2022. Others are on their way for 2025 potentially.  One of the hottest topics in the event was the rise of secondary sales to create a path to liquidity. 2024 experienced a record amount of private equity sales in the secondary market, representing a ~45% increase than the previous year. Traditionally, venture capitalists have looked to M&A or IPOs as the principal routes to exit. But as holding periods have increased and IPO rates have decreased, secondary firms have risen to the opportunity. These can take many forms, including internal (continuation funds), or secondary firms for LPs (buying a full stake) or GPs (to sell particular positions). The important thing to remember however, is that the exit may not be the end of the road. Reflecting on IPOs, Punter said: \u201cBeing public doesn\u2019t mean it is the end of the game\u2014it\u2019s part of the journey.\u201d Many VCs are holding their positions in public companies, so this may not be the DPI point depending on the firm\u2019s policy.  One change since 2021 I\u2019m personally most excited about is the resurgence of diligence in venture and capital allocation more broadly. Lamenting the FOMO era (Fear Of Missing Out), which yielded investments into firms like FTX, Jeff Ransdell of Fuel VC explained the importance of real diligence. Within his firm, he embeds technologists in diligence teams. Yet, incentives are not always aligned. In 2024, 30 VC firms raised ~75% of all US venture capital fundraising. This concentration creates market dislocations, with larger firms looking for companies to place large checks. In my own view, and through our work at Fluent Ventures, we\u2019ve noticed that deal processes have slowed, giving the time to do real work, and build genuine relationships with founders before investing.  Clearly one of the hottest topics at the event was the rise of AI. This will manifest itself across multiple areas of the financial services capital formation ecosystem. In VC, new models are emerging. Across growth equity and private equity, AI is being used to lower costs and increase margins. All managers I met were exploring this as a core opportunity across multiple use cases. One rising trend are camel seed-strappers. Startups leveraging AI can get to first revenue much faster and with less capital. They can test and scale their offering. Some are able to do this while only raising a single round of capital. This is creating a paradox. Large VC firms are looking to deploy more capital. Yet, seed strappers need (and want less). This creates a risk for overfunding, artificial valuations, and herd mentality investments, which seems contradictory to recent learnings the industry experienced.  Despite liquidity concerns, LP enthusiasm for private markets is rebounding. New sectors have clearly benefited, like the rise of private credit, which at the start of 2024 expanded to 1.5 trillion (from 1 in 2020). Many panels highlighted the core advantages to alternative assets. Beyond raw performance, they can be uncorrelated (and one thing some fintech startups have historically looked to offer across multiple product categories). Differentiated global strategies are becoming more attractive to LPs seeking non-traditional exposure. Other areas that might seem on the downstream are not gone yet. For example ESG, which despite facing pressure, was still positioned as a core metric. As Michelle Davidson of Aksia explained in one session: \u201cESG is part of the due diligence process. Same as every other risk. It is client-specific.\u201d  Overall, what we\u2019re seeing is a return to optimism, but in a more measured way. FOMO is dead. Diligence is back. Blitzscaling in startups has been replaced by Camels. Seedstrapping is a new model. This is influencing how LPs are thinking. Yet the story is not yet fully written. Reflecting on a panel title referencing \u201cthe rise of optimism\u201d, Mark Hoeing of CF Private Equity said \u201cThe headline was probably written six months ago. Things have changed quite a bit.\u201d Shakiness in the public markets and uncertainty in new regulation, mean the field remains quite dynamic, and will certainly continue to evolve.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-29","content":"At least 15 people are thought to still be alive and trapped under the rubble of a Bangkok skyscraper that collapsed after a massive earthquake hit Myanmar and Thailand. Rescuers say they have detected signs of life and communicated with some survivors under the 10-storey tall mountain of debris. Scores of construction workers remain missing at the site, as the rescue effort heads into its second day. The 7.7-magnitude quake occurred on Friday afternoon local time, killing hundreds at the epicentre near Mandalay, Myanmar. Its powerful effects could be felt hundreds of miles away in the Thai capital, as well as in China and India. There have been reports of widespread devastation in the Saigaing region and Mandalay, including flattened buildings and temple spires toppled. Officials in Myanmar say over 1,000 have died so far while another 2,376 are injured. In Bangkok, thousands experienced the quake's effects as buildings swayed and water sloshed out of swimming pools. Officials said they received 2,000 reports of cracks appearing in buildings. But the capital has emerged largely unscathed \u2013 except for the unfinished headquarters for the auditor-general's office, which remains the focal point of the damage in Thailand. Situated just across from the tourist landmark Chatuchak market, the 30-storey skyscraper once featured a gleaming tower of blue glass and steel. The earthquake has reduced it to a mountain of twisted rebar and shattered concrete, dwarfing the hundreds of rescue workers scurrying around it. Out of the more than 400 workers who were at the site, at least 96 are missing, while eight have died and another eight found injured, according to the latest official figures.  Some are believed to be Burmese. Many Burmese migrants work in Thailand's construction industry. Throughout Friday night and into Saturday morning, drones, sniffer dogs, cranes and excavators were brought in to help with the rescue effort. By lunchtime, officials said they had detected at least 15 people alive beneath the rubble, located some 5m to 10m from the top of the pile. Burmese construction worker Ko Myint Kyaw was on the scaffolding on the third floor of the building at the time the earthquake struck. \"When [the earthquake] got stronger, I just jumped and I escaped. When I hit the ground, I heard a loud bang and the building collapsed,\" he told BBC Burmese. The worker said he was part of a group of Burmese people working on the construction project, and the authorities had already discovered the bodies of two people with whom he had worked with. As the \"building collapsed like a pancake\" \u2013 and is continuing to collapse \u2013 rescue work has been difficult, forcing officials to refrain from using heavy machinery, one official said. They said they were able to make contact with some of the survivors who \"shouted and made noise\". Others were detected by their movements and body heat. \"We want to save them as soon as possible,\" said one official. \"Some signs of life we received last night have since gone silent. I want all Thais to pray for them, to be strong.\" Officials have yet to find out why the building collapsed, and have given investigators a week to probe. In a dusty corner of the construction site, tents and desks were set up to register the details of relatives of the missing. Solemn-faced groups of people, mostly women, gathered in the tent in the sweltering heat, their faces clouded with worry. Occasionally, some burst out in sobs. \"I wanted to come here desperately, I wanted to see my husband,\" wailed one woman, who gave her name as Naruemol, as her friend comforted her. \"I just need to see him once, in whatever condition he's in.\" One man named Siew, who was waiting to hear news of two missing cousins, told the BBC: \"I think the chance of them surviving is very slim\u2026 In my heart, I don't know if they will survive.\" Top government officials have vowed to continue the search for the missing workers. Deputy Prime Minister Anutin Charnweerakul addressed reporters while visiting the site, saying: \"We work tirelessly and are still working around the clock to make sure that everbody is safe.\" \"We will keep working until there is no one left inside\u2026 We always have hope.\" Additional reporting by Sawitree Jang, Arunoday Mukharji and Nick Marsh Paul Chambers, a university lecturer, to face police interview on Tuesday under lese-majeste and computer crime laws. Mary and Des Byrne are looking for a home in Middlesbrough after finally being able to return. More than 3,000 people have died and thousands have been displaced in Myanmar. Rescue and relief workers seeking access to some of the worst quake-hit areas are being blocked by the military.

While Frontier clearly believes there's plenty of demand between the city pairs, it's not alone; the carrier will face steep competition on each of the routes.

For instance, there are already 220 flights in each direction between SAN and SLC for June, according to data from Cirium; the flights are operated by Alaska Airlines, Spirit Airlines, Southwest Airlines and, most prolifically on the route, Delta Air Lines, which accounts for 146 of those flights. Meanwhile, there are about 270 flights in each direction between SAN and ORD, flown by American Airlines and United Airlines. Still, Frontier often takes a strategy similar to fellow ultra-low-cost carrier Spirit, offering a stripped-down, bare-bones product at a low price while competing directly against legacy carriers. This differs from other airlines like Breeze Airways that prefer to avoid direct competition by operating between city pairs with no existing nonstop service. However, the strategy of competing with no-frills and low fares has been hit hard in recent years, as the legacy airlines have introduced and fine-tuned their own basic economy options. In response, budget carriers, including Frontier, have taken a page out of the legacies' book, offering more options and services. For instance Frontier allows passengers to pay to block middle seats in their rows, giving them more space, along with extra legroom. The airline also recently announced that it will begin offering first-class seats later this year. Spirit \u2014 which Frontier has expressed interest in acquiring \u2014 is shaking up its offering with new segmented fares and cabins. Time will tell whether the new routes work for Frontier, though we likely won't have to wait very long: Frontier is famous for pulling new routes almost as quickly as it launches them, preferring to read initial market signs and cut its losses instead of taking time to see if a new market can develop.
