{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Business Insider Edition  The outlook for the stock market is becoming increasingly uncertain, thanks largely to the potential impact of an escalating global trade war.           Strategists at Goldman Sachs on Sunday night slashed their\u00a0forecast for the S&P 500\u00a0for the second time this year, lowering targets for the benchmark index's return to -5% in the coming three months and 6% over 12 months, down from 0% and 16% respectively.               That implies the S&P 500 trading between 5,300 to 5,900 over the next year, the bank said in a note to clients, meaning they don't expect the index to return to previous all-time highs are 6,100 anytime soon.                The downgrade is largely driven by the impact of President Donald Trump's tariff policy, which is shaping up to be more severe than the bank was expecting, according to a team led by Goldman's chief US equity strategist, David Kostin.               The bank now expects the average US tariff rate to hover around 18%, up 15 basis points from last year. It also expects average annual GDP growth to slow to 1.5% from last year's 2%, while core PCE inflation, which is the Fed's preferred inflation measure, will accelerate to 3.5%, up from last year's 3%.               \"Higher tariffs, weaker economic growth, and greater inflation than we previously assumed lead us to cut our S&P 500 EPS growth forecasts to +3 in 2025 (from +7%) and +% in 2026 (from +7%),\" strategists said. \"We expect a further valuation decline in the near term,\" they added.               The bank also sees the US facing a higher risk of recession in the next year. Goldman economists now estimate that the US has a 35% chance of tipping into a recession in the next 12 months, up from the prior estimate of 20%.               If stocks follow the historical playbook for a recession, the S&P 500 could see a 25% drawdown from its peak, strategists said. That implies the index will drop as low as 4,600 in the event of a downturn, the bank estimated, or a 21% drop from the index's current levels.               \"We continue to recommend investors watch for an improvement in the growth outlook, more asymmetry in market pricing, or depressed positioning before trying to trade a bottom,\" strategists wrote.               Stocks have been mired in a correction after falling more than 10% from mid-February highs, and the S&P 500 is now down 5% since the start of the year.               Markets have been dealing with greater uncertainty stemming from Trump's trade policy and retaliatory tariffs slapped, as well as the growing risk of a recession in the US.               Economic growth has already shown signs of slowing. GDP is expected to contract 2.8% for the first quarter, according to the latest projection from the Atlanta Fed.       Inflation\u00a0was also hotter than expected last month, with PCE prices accelerating 2.8% year over year.               Wall Street forecasters, including\u00a0Stifel, UBS, and\u00a0Bank of America, have been warning of the rising risk of\u00a0stagflation, a scenario that involves sluggish growth and high inflation and which could be more difficult for the Fed to deal with than a recession.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"As a harsh reminder\u00e2\u0080\u0094even though it feels like its been a decade since December, 2024\u00e2\u0080\u0094we have only managed to muddle through three months of 2025. It\u2019s been an awkward time to love tech. As both consumers and the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest tech companies wrestled with the impact of Trump tariffs on supply chains. At the very least, we found several new favorite products of 2025 have already arrived. AMD started with with its response to Nvidia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mid-range GPUs, and Apple seized our attention yet again with the launch of its MacBook Air M4 and new Mac Studio. But the ides of March did indeed bring ill winds. This month was supposed to offer us the full look at Google Pixel 9a plus a heaping helping of gaming laptops sporting the latest Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs. However, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a rash of delays. We now have to sit on our hands, waiting for Google\u2019s latest phone and our most-anticipated laptops, plus devices like\u00c2\u00a0Nothing 3a Pro\u00c2\u00a0and\u00e2\u0080\u0094reportedly\u00e2\u0080\u0094Nvidia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s RTX 5060 and 5060 Ti. With more mobile gaming platforms on the way for April, including the full reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2, next month is shaping up to be one of the most impactful for the tech world in recent memory. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve long been promised an exoskeleton revolution. While the Hypershell X won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have you throwing cars or jumping 20 feet in the air, it does actually do a lot to make leg exercises easier. The device detects when you move your leg, then assists that movement with in-built motors. In our tests, we found it aided a three-hour hike so well it left us a third as fatigued as we would be without it. The Hypershell Pro X model also had a surprisingly strong battery life that could keep up even when on the move for several hours. Foldables have yet to find their place in today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crowded U.S. smartphone market, but the Oppo Find N5 is making a strong case that U.S. foldables need to catch up, and soon. The Find N5 is larger than Samsung and Google\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offerings, and it\u2019s thinner to boot. Bummer then that the device isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t available for sale in North America. Our next best hope to get a device like the Find N5 is to wait for OnePlus. That company is owned by the same conglomerate as Oppo. The MacBook Air remains one of the best laptops, just as it has been since the advent of the M1 chip. The new version comes with a \u00e2\u0080\u009csky blue\u00e2\u0080\u009d color that looks more like a cloudy day than a sunny sky, but it also starts at its lowest price ever at $1,000. For that, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting a strong performance uptick from the M3 MacBook Air. It has especially powerful graphics performance, managing to scoot in just under the MacBook Pro 14 with M4 in our benchmarks. At this point, the MacBook Air M4 is so close to perfection it just needs a new display without the notch to become our most-recommended laptop. One of the best (and most-expensive) gaming laptops is now smaller (and more-expensive) than it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ever been. The Razer Blade 16 in 2025 includes a Nvidia GeForce RT 5090 at the top end, so you already know performance is going to be solid across the board. It also packs a 2560 x 1600 OLED display to show off all those pretty graphics from the most-demanding titles. While it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the battery life you need for using it as your all-day, on the go device, the thinner design is a benefit for those who want to put the Razer Blade 16 in their bag and not feel like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re lugging around a 5-pound brick. For the sake of on-the-go, pill-shaped speakers, the JBL Charge 6 is leading the pack in audio quality for its size. We found its audio quality was far more measured than the previous iterations of the Charge, with solid highs and mids to go along with its normally-excellent bass. JBL\u00e2\u0080\u0099s small speaker continues to be durable and still has enough juice to last for a long listening session. If you have two on hand, you can combine them with the PartyTogether on the JBL Portable feature to facilitate some stereo audio too. When the high-end graphics card market was effectively monopolized by Nvidia, AMD had to show up and make a case for lower-end, cheaper GPUs. With the Radeon RX 9070 XT, the company succeeded with room to spare. The graphics card meets or beats performance from the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and costs $150 less MSRP. The new FSR 4 upscaling model, which is exclusive to this and the Radeon RX 9070, also provides a solid uptick in performance without sacrificing too much visual quality. Of course, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be lucky to get the RX 9070 XT at $600 (or even find it in stock), but it still comes out cheaper than Nvidia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s equivalent.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Business Insider Edition  Good morning. Elon Musk held a town hall in Wisconsin on Sunday. Over the course of 100 minutes, he gave out million-dollar checks and fielded questions about sending federal savings to taxpayers. He also acknowledged the slump in his net worth, much of which has come from Tesla's falling stock price. Read the five takeaways here.          In today's big story, college students are running out of job prospects \u2014 and it could haunt them for years to come.       What's on deck   Markets: Gold may be thriving now, but one analyst says he could see a correction in the metal's future.       Tech: I attended two Tesla Takedown Protests. One generation showed up more than others.       Business: Even Hollywood is caving to Trump 2.0.               But first, what's a college senior to do?       If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.   \"Government jobs are secure. What drew me into it was the stability.\"           That's what one Gen Z student who was pursuing a career in public service told BI's Aki Ito.               Things aren't exactly going to plan.               With DOGE office initiatives ranging from slashing government budgets to dismantling entire federal agencies, public service jobs don't quite have the reputation for stability that they once had.               Roughly two million students set to graduate this spring are entering an exceptionally shaky job market.               Some of them have seen their offers at federal agencies rescinded; others have received no word on jobs they applied for months ago.               It's not just government positions that are taking a hit \u2014 it's jobs at a whole host of businesses, nonprofits, and universities that rely on federal funding and contracts.               Oh, and going to graduate school (a classic backup plan for many indecisive undergrads) might not be an option, either, unless the Department of Education manages to deliver financial aid in a timely fashion.       To make matters worse, the outlook is likely to get even more dismal in the months ahead.           President Donald Trump's tariff wars have spurred companies to hold off on hiring, investors are already bracing for the looming threat of stagflation, and the long list of major companies laying off staff this year is growing even longer.               Gen Z is running out of job prospects \u2014 and their careers could suffer for years to come, Aki writes.       1. Not all that glitters is gold, but gold could lose its shine, too. Despite a record-setting rally for the precious metal, one Morningstar analyst suggested prices could drop 38% in the coming years. He told BI three reasons bullion prices could decrease in the long term.       2. You don't have to spend less in a down market \u2014 but plenty of people cut back anyway. Americans pull back spending when they perceive a loss of wealth in the stock market, even if their incomes don't change. It's one way stock market woes spill into the broader economy.       3. The possible $35 trillion lifeline for US homeowners. If a recession were to strike, home equity lines of credit could give a boost. But their full potential as a stimulant remains to be seen.       1. AI twins are happening, and users are getting emotional. David Kushner can get advice from his mom anytime \u2014 even after she dies. That's because the two worked with a company to bring her to life in AI form. The end result took Kushner by surprise.       2. Takeaways from the Tesla Takedown. Protesters gathered at Tesla showrooms nationwide on Saturday to oppose Elon Musk's political role. A BI reporter joined nearly 400 protesters at a Tesla showroom in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and a smaller protest outside a mall in Troy. She said one generation showed up more than others.       3. xAI buys X. Elon Musk announced on Friday in a post on X that his artificial intelligence company, xAI, had acquired his social media platform, X, in an all-stock deal. The deal valued xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion.       1. The Big Stay? More like the Big Cling To Your Desk. Even though the job market looks good on paper, research shows consumer expectations for unemployment over the next year are at their worst level since the Great Recession, prompting some workers to stay put.       2. Charlie Javice was convicted Friday on four counts of defrauding JPMorgan Chase. Federal prosecutors asked that she be required to wear an ankle monitor prior to sentencing. Her lawyer objected, saying it would make her job as a pilates instructor \"impossible.\"   3. Make Hollywood Great Again. The entertainment industry is quietly pulling back on DEI amid Trump 2.0. Studios are reducing queer storylines and ditching efforts to diversify casting, while financiers are heavily scrutinizing filmmakers' politics before investing, industry insiders told BI.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"        A Mart\u00ednez                        Protesters rally against Tesla CEO Elon Musk outside a Tesla store in San Francisco on Saturday.                                                           Noah Berger\/AP                                       hide caption  Protests against Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk took place across the country over the weekend and are spreading globally. The Tesla Takedown movement is urging people to sell their Tesla cars and stock. Many are upset with Musk for his unelected but powerful role in the Trump administration. He heads the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 DOGE, which has been making aggressive cuts across government. Both President Trump and Musk say the cuts are important to combat bureaucracy and fraud. Tesla has experienced a decline in global sales, particularly in Europe and China. Since Musk's political turn, investors have grown uneasy. But market analysts also question how much of the drop in Tesla sales and shares can be attributed to Musk's actions alone. Morning Edition spoke with branding expert Allen Adamson about Tesla's struggles, which he attributes to several factors: Musk's lack of focus on the company and innovation, the brand's shifting public perception and the increasing role of politics in consumer decisions. Adamson is the co-founder and managing partner of Metaforce, a marketing consultancy, and the author of Seeing the How: Transforming What People Do, Not Buy, To Gain Market Advantage, which is about consumer behavior, behavioral psychology and marketing analysis. The interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. A Mart\u00ednez:\u00a0 So, Allen, why are Tesla sales falling right now in particular? Is it about Elon Musk's work at DOGE or is it maybe something else? Whenever a business fails, it's never about one thing. Or a brand gets into trouble. It's usually about many things. So the brand problems now are: his DOGE issue, his Cybertruck recall\u2026 lots of things. It's having a cumulative effect and it's reached the tipping point. Mart\u00ednez: Have there been other examples that you could point to in the past where something that a CEO has said or done affected their company sales?\u00a0 Not in the car industry, for sure. There are smaller examples, but nothing at this scale. Mart\u00ednez: Allen, what is it about cars that make it such a different market than other products? Is it one of those things where, when you buy a car, it says something about you, without saying anything at all, necessarily? Most people think, 'I bought the car because it has good acceleration. I like the way it steers.' But when you look at car performance, there's no difference between cars. They all get roughly the same mileage, either electric or gas. You look inside, they all hook up to your smartphone. In fact, when you get in many cars, and if you don't look at the brand, you have no idea what car you're in. And so cars are what we call badge brands. They are identity signals. They say, 'I'm driving a BMW, I'm driving a Ford pickup truck,' because it says something about you. It's more like a beer brand and a fashion brand. You park it in a driveway to say, 'Look at me. I'm a green person. I'm driving a Tesla, or look at me, I'm a real macho person, I'm driving this big pickup truck.' And so cars are always about the brand image and once the brand image is not something you want to say to your neighbors, you're in big trouble in a category that's brand-driven. Mart\u00ednez: But would it be easy if, say, for some reason, he divests in Tesla, sells every bit of stock and ownership stake that he has in Tesla, and then all of a sudden, has nothing to do with the brand? That would probably be the best thing for the brand. That's the only easy fix, which is, 'I'm selling it, I'm going to focus on other things I'm interested in.' And the new ownership team is going to keep their eye on the ball. Because I think the issue is focus. If you're building a car that has your life at stake when you drive it, you don't want a brand perception that the people at a company are moving fast and breaking things. You want somebody you can trust to say, 'when I get in this car, the wheels aren't going to fall off or I'm not going to get killed.' So having this sort of erratic personality is probably a more damaging brand attribute than helping the government try to save money on federal employees.\u00a0 Mart\u00ednez: So I think the lesson here for any current CEO or aspiring CEO is maybe don't ever talk politics publicly. That's always been a lesson, and now, the more polarized the country is, the more true it is. And it will be a good lesson for other CEOs to say, 'look, as much as my employees want me to speak out or I want to speak out, less is more.' Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Things are about to get even more turbulent for the tech industry. by  Lauren Feiner Things are about to get even more turbulent for the tech industry. by  Lauren Feiner As TikTok\u2019s April 5th sell-by date approaches, Americans are back to where they stood before the original January deadline: watching anxiously to see if a major social media app gets banned. But that\u2019s far from the only big event we\u2019ll see over the coming month. April is filled with momentous turns in long-running tech policy stories \u2014 some possibly industry-changing, others at risk of fizzling out. The first two and a half months of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term were highly consequential for the tech industry, which faces real challenges despite largely cozying up to Trump. After the chaos of the fired FTC commissioners, DOGE\u2019s dismantling of the federal government, and constantly delayed tariffs, the next few weeks could be extraordinarily busy, too. Deadlines that Trump let slip are coming up, as are long-planned ones, such as those covering TikTok, new tariffs, and a pair of juggernaut antitrust cases involving Apple and Meta.  Here\u2019s everything you need to know to be prepared.  Trump said he intentionally chose April 2nd over April Fools\u2019 Day because he\u2019s \u201ca little superstitious,\u201d but it\u2019s still wise to expect the unexpected for taxes on imported goods. The official order he released last week clarifies a 25 percent tariff on automobile imports will take effect at 12:01AM ET on April 3rd. He\u2019s also threatened to implement: Trump\u2019s tariffs have fluctuated and stalled amid blowback and discussions with foreign leaders, but the early April deadline for vehicle imports to the US has held so far. Trump has promised a permanent 25 percent tariff on cars and trucks that are imported into the country, while the reciprocal tariffs are meant to alleviate what his administration views as imbalances with trade partners. The auto tariff is expected to apply to both foreign manufacturers and American car companies that manufacture vehicles abroad and import them to the US. Experts anticipate the cost will ultimately raise prices for US consumers buying new cars. TikTok is still legally required to divest from its parent company ByteDance, and as with its original January deadline, it\u2019s running out the clock before a ban kicks in. Trump signed an executive order delaying the ban on his first day in office, promising not to enforce the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act against TikTok service providers \u2014 including companies like Oracle, Akamai, Fastly, Amazon Web Services, Apple, and Google \u2014 for 75 days. That order was already legally questionable, given that the law requiring TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner to divest it to operate in the US already took effect and was upheld by the Supreme Court. Apple and Google held off on returning TikTok to their app stores until Attorney General Pam Bondi reportedly sent them a letter assuring they\u2019d be immune from legal consequences under the Trump administration if they did. Trump has promised a TikTok sale agreement before the deadline, but the details remain vague. It\u2019s still quite possible that he will simply extend the arbitrary deadline again, attempting to keep the status quo while supposedly hammering out the deal. But as Senate Democrats have warned, repeated legally dodgy extensions leave TikTok\u2019s service providers increasingly vulnerable \u2014 the statute of limitations on the law extends past Trump\u2019s term, and they risk hundreds of billions of dollars in fines for defying the act. Apple, AWS, Google, Akamai, Fastly, and Oracle did not respond to requests for comment. \u201cByteDance must fully divest its control of TikTok and have no say in its operations; nor can the two share data, content, or algorithms\u201d Alternatively, Trump may present the details of a deal (however vague) by the deadline. Multiple contenders have thrown their hat in the ring to take TikTok off ByteDance\u2019s hands, including billionaire Frank McCourt\u2019s Project Liberty and Perplexity. Oracle is reportedly in a leading position for a partnership with TikTok to ensure that US user data can\u2019t be accessed by the Chinese government \u2014 but the reported details sound a whole lot like Project Texas, which US officials previously dismissed as too porous to protect US national security. It\u2019s not clear this would meet the legal requirements for divestiture, and even the top Republican on the House Select Committee on China has warned that \u201cByteDance must fully divest its control of TikTok and have no say in its operations; nor can the two share data, content, or algorithms.\u201d There\u2019s also the matter of whether the Chinese government will agree to let any version of a sale happen. Essentially, based on the options currently on the table, we\u2019re probably about to see the start of yet another legal battle around TikTok.  The FTC filed its antimonopoly suit against Meta back in late 2020, when it was still known as Facebook, and the two sides will finally meet in court on April 14th to kick off the trial. For several weeks, Judge James Boasberg will hear testimony on whether Meta illegally monopolized the personal social networking market, in part through its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, which the FTC alleges could have been formidable competitors. If he agrees with the government that Meta broke the law, both sides will return later to figure out what should be done about it \u2014 including, potentially, unwinding the acquisitions. It\u2019s been a rocky case for the FTC, all the way back to Trump\u2019s first term, when the original lawsuit was filed with support from two minority Democratic commissioners and the Republican agency chair. That first complaint \u2014 alongside a separate lawsuit filed by 48 state and district attorneys general \u2014 was thrown out by the judge. But Boasberg left the option for the FTC to try again. The agency filed an amended complaint during the Biden administration under Democratic chair Lina Khan, seeking to resolve concerns with the initial complaint. The result was sufficient to move the lawsuit forward; in November 2024, after Boasberg mostly denied Meta\u2019s motion to dismiss, he resolved that the case would move to trial. Now, that trial will begin with the FTC back under Republican control. Also in DC\u2019s District Court, the second phase of the Google Search monopoly trial begins next month. Judge Amit Mehta ruled last summer that Google has illegally monopolized the online general search market, as well as the market for search text ads. Now, Google and the Justice Department will spend two weeks debating what changes the judge should impose to remedy the harm created by the illegal monopolization (a characterization Google intends to appeal).  At the end of the Biden administration, the DOJ said that appropriate remedies would include forcing Google to spin out its Chrome browser \u2014 a key access point for search engines \u2014 syndicate the data that makes its search results so powerful, and ban exclusionary deals like its multibillion dollar agreement with Apple. After the Trump administration took over, the DOJ maintained many of the same asks, though it modified a few, including letting Google pay Apple for non-search-related agreements. Mehta has said he aims to issue a decision by this August. Apple is not a party to the case, but it has fought to play a bigger role in the remedies phase because it fears its interests might not be sufficiently represented by Google. But an appeals court agreed with Mehta that Apple will have to settle for filing briefs to explain its point of view, rather than taking a more active role in the trial.

In Europe, the British FTSE 100 fell by 1.18%, the German DAX index fell by 1.82% and France's CAC 40 dropped by 1.76%. Gold -- a traditional safe-haven asset -- reached a new record high of $3,128 per ounce. Trump told reporters this weekend that his tariffs could affect \"all the countries.\" \"The tariffs will be far more generous than those countries were to us, meaning they will be kinder than those countries were to the United States of America,\" he said. \"Over the decades, they ripped us off like no country has never been ripped off in history and we're going to be much nicer than they were to us, but it's substantial money for the country,\" Trump said. Auto tariffs of 25% are among those expected to come into effect on April 3. The measures will apply to imported passenger vehicles, including cars, SUVs, minivans, cargo vans and light trucks, according to a White House statement released last week. Analysts widely expect the tariffs to raise prices for foreign-made cars, since importers will likely pass along a share of the tax burden to consumers. Cars produced in the U.S. are also expected to undergo significant price hikes since manufacturers will bear higher costs for imported parts and face an uptick in demand as buyers seek out domestic alternatives, experts have told ABC News. Trump dismissed concerns about auto tariffs this weekend. \"The automakers are going to make a lot of money,\" he said. \"American automakers or international automakers, if you're talking about them, are going to build in the United States.\" \"The people that are going to make money are people that manufacture cars in the United States,\" he continued. \"Outside of the United States, that's going to be up to them. I don't care too much about that. But you have a lot of companies coming into the country to manufacture cars.\" ABC News' Hannah Demissie contributed to this report. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":1}
{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Amazon is still seen as a bit of a laggard in the race to develop advanced artificial intelligence, but it has quietly created a lab that is now setting records when it comes to AI performance. Amazon\u2019s AGI SF Lab, which is located in San Francisco and dedicated to building artificial general intelligence, or AI that surpasses the capabilities of humans, revealed the first fruits of its work today: A new AI model capable of powering some of the most advanced AI agents available anywhere. The new model, called Amazon Nova Act, outperforms ones from OpenAI and Anthropic on several benchmarks designed to gauge the intelligence and aptitude of AI agents, Amazon says. On the benchmarks GroundUI Web and ScreenSpot, Amazon Nova Act performs better than Claude 3.7 Sonnet and OpenAI Computer Use Agent. A major part of Amazon\u2019s plan to compete in the AI market is to focus on building agents, and the new model\u2019s abilities reflect its efforts to build a generation of tools that can measure up to the very best available. \u201cI believe that the basic atomic unit of computing in the future is going to be a call to a giant [AI] agent,\u201d says David Luan, who leads Amazon\u2019s AGI SF Lab. He was previously a vice president of engineering at OpenAI and later cofounded Adept, a startup that pioneered work on AI agents, before joining Amazon in 2024. Most of the leading AI labs are now focused on building increasingly capable AI agents. Getting AI to master independent actions, as well as conversation, promises to make the technology more useful and valuable. The shift from chat to action is still very much a work in progress, however. In the past six months, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and others have demonstrated web-browsing agents that take actions in response to a prompt. But for the most part, these agents are still unreliable, and they can easily be tripped up by open-ended requests. Luan says that Amazon\u2019s goal is building AI agents that are dependable rather than flashy. The thing holding agents back is not the need for \u201cmore cool demos of interesting capabilities that work 60 percent of the time, it\u2019s the Waymo problem,\u201d he says, referring to how self-driving cars needed to be trained to deal with unusual edge cases before they could take to the streets unsupervised. Many so-called agents are built by combining large language models with multiple human-written rules that are designed to prevent them from veering off course, but also makes their behavior brittle. Amazon Nova Act is a version of the company's most powerful homegrown model Amazon Nova that has received additional training to help it make decisions about what actions to take and at what time. In general, Luan says, AI models struggle to decide when they should intervene in a task. To improve Nova\u2019s agential abilities, Amazon is using reinforcement learning, a method that has helped other AI models better simulate reasoning. Amazon is also taking inspiration from physical robots with its new models. Luan\u2019s team is working with another group at Amazon based in San Francisco led by Pieter Abbeel, a professor at UC Berkeley who works on finding AI applications for robotics. Abbeel, a fellow early OpenAI employee, joined Amazon in August 2024 after it invested in his startup, Covariant. Amazon is well positioned to make progress in robotics given the vast numbers of those already deployed in its fulfillment centers. The release of Amazon Nova Act suggests that Amazon could emerge as a dark horse in the race to create useful software agents. The company was slow in responding to ChatGPT, but it has more recently shown signs of getting its act together. In February, the company announced a new version of its voice assistant Alexa with improved conversational abilities as well as the capacity to automate certain web tasks. One use case Amazon cited is Alexa helping to book a repair service for a broken oven. Luan says Alexa\u2019s new agentic capabilities were developed by his team. As WIRED revealed in October, Amazon has also done research on how agents might eventually improve ecommerce by automating the process of finding and buying things. Such an agent might preemptively add items to a user\u2019s cart based on their interests and habits, Amazon\u2019s engineers said. Besides unveiling the new model, Amazon today announced a software development kit (SDK) designed to make it easier for computer engineers to use Amazon Nova Act to build software agents. The SDK lets developers give their agent specific instructions to help them navigate an internet built for human users. For example, an agent can be instructed \u201cdon\u2019t accept the insurance upsell\u201d when booking a rental car. Ultimately, Luan says, Amazon\u2019s agents should become smart enough not to fall for the upsell on their own. \u201cNova Act is really like the very first step in that vision,\u201d he says.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Business Insider Edition  The Big Four only have a tiny fraction of the legal market \u2014 but there's an area they might have an edge.          Stuart Bedford, KPMG's head of legal services, told Business Insider that Big Four firms like his could handle the \"enormous scale\" integration needed once a merger deal is past the initial finishing line.               \"You need that institutional scale to be able to really translate the legal advisory into the world of large global clients seeking to solve problems which cut across many areas of their business and many jurisdictions.\"               Bedford, who is himself a Big Law veteran, having worked at the Magic Circle firm Linklaters for 20 years, said that Big Law firms are \"absolute machines\" at mergers and acquisitions and merger control filings because \"they are designed and set up for that.\"               He added he could not think of anyone \"outside the Big Four\" that can offer \"the right amount of investment in the technology, in the global infrastructure, plus the law to be able to really put it all together.\"               Traditionally consulting and accountancy firms, the Big Four first started pushing into the legal sector in 2010 to operate as \"Alternative Legal Services Providers.\"                While they operate in key markets like the UK, Germany, and Canada, their legal divisions remain smaller by head count and revenue than other business lines. The Big Four represented just 5.6% of the ALSP market in 2023.               But KPMG wants in on this growing market. In North America, the UK, Europe, and Australia, the ALSP market has risen from less than $1 billion in 2015 to an estimated $28.5 billion in 2023, according to a January report by the Thomson Reuters Institute, the Center on Ethics and the Legal Profession at Georgetown Law, and Oxford University's Sad Business School.               In February, KPMG became the first of the Big Four to break into the US market by obtaining a unique license to practice law in Arizona. This circumvented a rule set by the American Bar Association that allows only licensed lawyers to own or invest in law firms.               Bedford said KPMG is targeting the managed services that follow a $10 million plus global acquisition deal, like changing documentation to fit with new policies or working out what to do with 500 newly redundant subsidiaries.               Bedford said this area \"doesn't have dominant players,\" adding, \"There is still a huge amount for us to play for.\"               He said that the firm's global operating model, unified technology platform, and multi-disciplinary operations make it uniquely placed to support large clients.               \"We are just so much more global than even the most global law firm,\" Bedford told BI.               Of KPMG's three divisions \u2014 audit, advisory, and tax & legal services \u2014 the latter was the fastest growing last year, up 9.5%. Business from its audit and advisory lines slowed to grow by 6% and 2%, respectively.               Bedford said KPMG Law was still at an early stage in its combined go-to-market strategy, adding that it was working across 80 jurisdictions to forge ties with KPMG's consulting, tax, and cyber teams.               \"Servicing large clients at scale globally through the multi-disciplinary approach. That is core to our strategy,\" he said.               Bedford said the firm, which is the smallest of the Big Four by employee numbers and revenue, \"needed the US\" market to expand its contract-managed services business.               \"It's the most sophisticated and most advanced,\" Bedford said. \"There is just a huge amount of opportunity to shoot for.\"               Legal experts\u00a0previously told BI\u00a0that the Big Four firm's entry into the US market will drive up competition for talent and business but is unlikely to cause disruption in the short term.               \"Legal services are hired based on long-term proven track record. Any new entry into the market is going to have to overcome that competitive energy,\" said Kirsten Keegan Vasquez, vice president of the legal recruiter Major, Lindsey & Africa.               Legal services is also not a story of uninterrupted growth for the Big Four. This March, EY confirmed to Business Insider that it was restructuring its UK Law business and laying off workers in the division.               In Australia, KPMG disbanded its in-house legal division in July 2024.                EY's Australia boss told staff it was planning to reduce its legal operations in the country in February, the Australian Financial Review reported in February 2025. PwC's legal business has also shrunk in Australia, AFR added.       Have a tip? Contact this reporter via email at pthompson@businessinsider.com or Signal at Polly_Thompson.89.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"The construction of the Sizewell C nuclear power plant on the Suffolk coast is a key part of the government's growth programme. But some locals fear being forced out, accusing landlords of cashing in on a jobs boom by evicting tenants and raising rents to unaffordable levels. Construction is due to be completed in 2031 and although a final investment decision has not yet been made, groundwork is already well under way. The construction project will require a predicted workforce of 7,900, of which about two-thirds will be from outside the area. About 2,400 workers will be based on site with 500 others living at the former Pontins holiday park at Pakefield, near Lowestoft.  The remaining contractors, however, will have to move into properties in or around the town of Leiston - population 5,508 - where some rents have doubled to more than \u00a33,000 a month. The government hopes to ban evictions without a reason as part of its new Renters' Rights Bill, but this will not be in place until summer at the earliest. Until then, John Stevens, who rents in Leiston, believes some landlords will look to move current tenants on in order to make use of East Suffolk Council's Sizewell C housing grants scheme. Aiming to provide an additional 1,200 beds, it offers property owners up to \u00a37,000 if they agree to turn their spare rooms or spaces into suitable accommodation. The council told the BBC it had so far \"received significant interest\" and expected to \"see a significant uptake in awards\" over the coming months. Mr Stevens, 72, says: \"[The landlords] are thinking, 'Let's evict these people and get the money, plus bigger rents', so why wouldn't landlords take advantage of it?\"  \"But it's ridiculous and it's changing the landscape because different people I know are going through murder because of Sizewell; they are being evicted. \"A friend of mine is [being evicted] and she is a single parent and has one kid \u2013 where is she going to go now?\" Rent hikes have proved particularly controversial in Leiston, traditionally seen as more affordable than the affluent coastal towns of Aldeburgh and Southwold. The current average monthly rent in the town, once a thriving manufacturing centre, is \u00a3773, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). But last month, the BBC found one three-bedroom semi-detached property in Carr Avenue advertised at \u00a33,000 a month, including bills and cleaning costs. Another three-bedroom home was going for \u00a33,100, including bills, while a two-bedroom apartment was being let for \u00a33,045, including bills. Since then, some rents have increased even further, with one three-bedroom house currently being advertised for the \"attention of Sizewell workers\" at \u00a34,500 per month. Daniela Delfino, 31, returned to Leiston in November 2023 to reconnect with her friends and stepfather. She rents a one-bedroom flat that her landlord, with whom she has a \"good relationship\", is looking to sell within the next few years. \"I really love living here and I don't want to leave, because then I will just be running around like a headless chicken, looking for somewhere affordable,\" she says. \"I did see a one-bedroom flat the other day but it was going for [nearly] three times as much as what I am paying now. The greed that is going around is not fair. \"No normal person can afford the current prices in Leiston or Saxmundham. It's not feasible, even if you are working full-time \u2013 it's absolutely ridiculous.\" Tina Ashford, 53, rents a detached property in the nearby village of Sudbourne with her two children for \u00a31,000 a month. But she has been served a no-fault eviction notice, which her landlord says is unrelated to Sizewell C. He says he simply plans to retire, and reduce his outgoings by selling the property. Nevertheless, it has left Ms Ashford, a single mother who works in holiday lettings and cares for an elderly couple, looking for a new home and worried about what she can afford. Ms Ashford says: \"My whole life depends on me being here, but the greedy prices and extortionate rents are affecting the rest of the market. \"I feel very angry and I think what is happening in Leiston is criminal. Landlords are cashing in and the good days are way behind us.\" According to the ONS, 79.1% of people in East Suffolk aged between 16 and 64 are in paid work. The average weekly wage in the district is \u00a3545, equivalent to a \u00a326,705 salary. But Toby Lindsay-White, who runs the Leiston Pantry food bank, is seeing a steady increase in members, and says locals no longer \"have the money to live in the area\". He says he knows of someone evicted from a four-bedroom bungalow that is being turned into an eight-bedroom home. \"It's a bit of a double-edged sword because we have a number of people who have finally secured employment with Sizewell C, so they are now on good pay,\" he says. \"But there has been a larger proportion of people who have had to move out of the area because their rent has increased or they've been served with a notice.\" Software engineer May Hall, 39, is also concerned. She rents a two-bedroom property in Leiston for \u00a3850 a month and has recently been offered a six-month tenancy. \"I don't know why they didn't offer me a one-year contract, but I'm hoping if they had wanted to rent it to a contractor for double or more, they'd have done so,\" she says. \"But I am still afraid that 'the market' will trend upward quickly and they will just follow it or change their mind. \"So yeah, it feels like Sizewell is the feudal lord of the land here with landlords as vassals and we're at their total mercy. 'Uncertainty' is the word.\" However, the employment boom has helped save one struggling village pub. Sarah Hartman, 66, runs The Butchers Arms in Knodishall, offering bed and breakfast, a 10-minute drive from Sizewell. She estimates about 75% of guests are Sizewell workers, bringing in an extra \u00a310,000 a month. \"It makes a lot of difference to us and keeps us open because, as just a pub, it is not sustainable. So if it wasn't for Sizewell, we would not survive,\" she says. \"It has done us a brilliant turn and come at just the right time, really. But I don't want to be greedy, so I haven't put the prices up. I just want to keep the place open.\" Tim Day, director of Suffolk Coastal Estate Agents and Sizewell Lettings, says much of the current demand is for \"a service solution\" \u2013 a short-term option including bills and cleaning, \"not dissimilar to a holiday letting\". Although quoted prices may state, for example, \u00a33,000 a month, the tenant may not actually have to stay that long, says Mr Day, 55. \"There's not much difference between offering a service solution to Sizewell workers and doing Airbnb. \"We're in the accommodation business and we are responding to demand. But when one looks at that headline rate, it might not tell the true story.\" Mr Day believes the demand for accommodation will soon spread far beyond Leiston as workers begin to travel in on park-and-ride buses from Wickham Market or Darsham. \"So... the catchment area for accommodation for contractors is going to be absolutely vast, stretching from Lowestoft to Ipswich to Felixstowe. \"With time, the reach for properties is going to be huge, and that might well mean that Leiston becomes less relevant.\" Sizewell C, partly funded by EDF, says it will support up to 70,000 jobs and provide energy for about six million homes for 60 years. Those behind the project, in which the government has an 85% stake, previously said they were working \"closely with the housing team at East Suffolk Council\" to ensure \"no negative impacts\" on the private housing sector and the local area. They also suggested it was \"unlikely\" that many workers involved in the project would have to pay the higher rents.  David Beavan, independent cabinet member for housing at the council, says the authority is \"proactively engaging with landlords to ensure rental prices remain as affordable as possible\" and monitoring the number of people presenting as homeless locally. \"We have a dedicated team working to mitigate any negative housing impacts from the construction,\" he adds. The housing situation is \"concerning\", says Suffolk Coastal's Labour MP Jenny Riddell-Carpenter. She says Sizewell C and the council need to work together to ensure that people in Leiston, rather than just private landlords, benefit from the opportunities of the new plant. \"I am in touch with Sizewell C, East Suffolk Council and relevant ministers, and will continue to make this point clearly,\" she says. The BBC contacted four landlords advertising homes for rents of at least \u00a33,000 per month in Leiston, but they either declined to comment or failed to respond. A spokesperson for the National Residential Landlords Association says \"fluctuations\" in rental prices reflect the increasing costs of providing quality accommodation and the scarcity of available homes.  \"Landlords' costs have increased significantly, which has unfortunately meant that many landlords have been forced to increase rents to ensure their businesses remain viable,\" they say. \"These financial pressures include hiked interest rates, significant tax increases, and the rising cost of maintenance which has forced many landlords out of the market. \"We continue to urge the government to introduce measures which will help stimulate growth across the UK's rental market.  \"A failure to do so will mean rents remain high and may continue to rise as the shortage of housing becomes more acute due to landlords exiting the market, reducing overall supply.\" Follow Suffolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"A Tesla dealership in Rome caught fire over the weekend, leaving behind the burned out husks of 17 of the vehicles. Police in Italy are investigating the fire as an act of arson. While one of his dealerships burned, Tesla CEO and shadow-president Elon Musk showed charts and graphs on stage in Wisconsin ahead of an election there. As Tesla literally burns, its CEO is everywhere but in the boardroom. Digos, Italy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anti-terrorism cops, are investigating the arson in Rome. In early conversations with the press, Digos said it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s possible that a group of anarchists set fire to the Teslas but nothing is confirmed. The fire department said that the blaze started around 4:30 a.m., destroyed 17 cars, and damaged the building where they were housed. Musk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship with Donald Trump is hurting his business, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s admitted as much in weepy interviews on Fox News. While he stood on a stage and gave away cash prizes in Wisconsin, people gathered at Tesla dealerships in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. More than 150 people showed up at one anti-Musk gathering in Chicago. Three hundred were at a protest in Syracuse, New York. In a Boston suburb, 600 showed up to protest Musk. In Berlin, someone covered the front of a dealership in blue paint. Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stock price has lost 50% of its value since December. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been up and down over the past few days but has not recovered anything approaching its pre-inauguration highs. It slipped again on Monday morning when trading started. First-quarter deliveries are expected to be way down, both because of Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economic policies and Musk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fading star. Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brand is so bad that Alset Auto, a company that sells Tesla and Cybertruck wraps, is running an ad that capitalizes on the chaos. In the ad, an Alset employee fields several calls from Tesla owners looking to protect their cars from eggs, paint, and other damage. \u00e2\u0080\u009cYes ma\u2019am, ceramic coating will protect your Tesla\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paint from offensive graffiti but we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do anything about you getting the finger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he says over footage of someone spray painting \u00e2\u0080\u009cFUCK ELON\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the car.\u00e2\u0080\u009d In the ad, another caller puts on a cowboy hat and sunglasses and stares wearily over their shoulder. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you want us to limo-tint your windows so no one recognizes you driving it? Yeah, we can do that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the worker says. He takes another call. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSo you want us to make a custom bumper sticker that reads: \u00e2\u0080\u0098I knew Elon was nuts, but not this nuts. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d sell my Tesla but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s depreciated so much I have negative equity on my loan?\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d The fire in Rome isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the first one to sweep a Tesla dealership. A few weeks ago someone threw a Molotov cocktail at a Tesla facility in Las Vegas and damaged five of the vehicles then began shooting at some of the vehicles. Days after the incident, the FBI announced it had created a task force to \u00e2\u0080\u009ccrack down on Violent Tesla attacks.\u00e2\u0080\u009d FBI Director Kash Patel called the various incidents of vandalism and destruction of Tesla vehicles terrorism. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is domestic terrorism.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"The European market\u2019s first attempt at playing catch-up with the satellite launch industry ended in a gigantic explosion off the Norwegian coast, where a German-made rocket crashed and burned. German startup Isar Aerospace launched its Spectrum rocket from the And\u00c3\u00b8ya spaceport on Sunday at 6:30 a.m. ET for its first test flight. The rocket successfully lifted off from its launchpad and spent around 30 seconds in the air before it started falling back down toward the Arctic Ocean, creating a massive fireball over the water. Launch, learn, repeat.#fromisartospace #goingfullspectrum pic.twitter.com\/nyqKKBTIsV \u2014 Isar Aerospace (@isaraerospace) March 30, 2025  The company later revealed that the flight was terminated shortly after liftoff, and the launch vehicle fell into the sea in a controlled manner. \u201cOur first test flight met all our expectations, achieving a great success,\u201dDaniel Metzler, CEO and co-founder of Isar Aerospace, said in an emailed statement. \u201cWe had a clean liftoff, 30 seconds of flight and even got to validate our Flight Termination System. We demonstrated that we can not only design and build but also launch rockets.\u201d With the launch, Isar became the first European space company to launch an orbital rocket from continental Europe. Its Spectrum rocket is designed to carry small and medium-sized satellites to orbit, with Germany being one of several European nations hoping to get in on the growing global industry of launching satellites. The industry is currently dominated by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX with its workhorse rocket, the Falcon 9, launching more than 400 times over the past 15 years. French company Arianespace is also in the business of launching satellites, though it uses a spaceport in French Guiana, South America. European countries have been struggling to keep up with the commercial space industry, with few options for launch vehicles. After cutting ties with Russia following its invasion of Ukraine and subsequently losing access to Soyuz rockets, the European market has been anxiously waiting for the debut of Arianespace\u2019s Ariane 6 as Europe\u2019s next-generation rocket. Ariane 6 suffered numerous delays before finally launching on its inaugural flight in June 2024. It still wasn\u2019t perfect, however, as the rocket\u2019s second stage failed to raise its altitude and deploy two of its payloads. The rocket redeemed itself earlier this year, deploying a high-resolution reconnaissance satellite to orbit in March. Evidently, the rocket business is hard. Isar Aerospace, however, has not been derailed by its less-than-ideal launch. The company is already planning the Spectrum rocket\u2019s second and third launch, while analyzing the data gathered during the first flight to determine the root cause behind the fatal anomaly. \u201cToday, we laid the foundation to cater to the rising global demand for flexible satellite launch services. Now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to analyze all data, learn, iterate and be back on the launch pad as soon as possible,\u201d Metzler said.  rocket launch failuresrocket launches  \r           Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r          \r           News from the future, delivered to your present.\r          \r       Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r                 A routine test turned into a surprise discovery when DARPA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s atmospheric sensors picked up something unexpected\u00e2\u0080\u0094courtesy of a falling SpaceX Falcon 9.                     The \"rapid unscheduled disassembly\" was likely caused by a propellant leak, Elon Musk said, and was captured on video by spectators on the ground.                     Elon Musk's company saw mixed results today, with Starship's booster sticking the landing while the upper stage failed during ascent.                     The heavy-lift launch vehicle blasted off and reached orbit earlier this morning, though the booster failed to perform a soft landing.                     \"It was suggested that the ring is space debris, but the evidence is marginal.\"                     A static fire test of the New Glenn rocket, which involved unauthorized use of a deluge system, cost the company $3,250.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2, titled Lawless has seized the battle royale island, transporting players to a thrilling realm of crime and anarchy. This season, which debuted on February 21, 2025, transforms the island into a heist playground, with gameplay centered on robbing vaults, hijacking trains, and breaking into Black Markets. This theme has brought a new meta, stressing strategy, speed, and the ability to outsmart opponents in high-stakes situations. Along with new features and a crime-focused Battle Pass, Epic Games has released an armory of weaponry that amp up the season\u2019s rebellious spirit, keeping players on their toes as they adapt to the battlefield\u2019s ever-changing dynamics. The loot pool caters to both sharpshooters and brawlers, including items such as the Falcon Eye Sniper and the Collateral Damage Assault Rifle. Recent upgrades have increased this pool even further, introducing a new wave of Exotic weapons that promise to revolutionize combat. However, the latest buzz is focused on a strange addition: the Lawless Rift Launcher and here\u2019s how you can get it. In Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2, the Lawless Rift Launcher is an Exotic weapon that can only be obtained through Black Market backdoors. To obtain it, players must have a Common Outlaw Keycard to gain entry to these prohibited regions. The Rogue Repairs Black Market, located northeast of Masked Meadows in the Rolling Blossom Farm area, is the primary source for purchasing the Lawless Rift Launcher. This backroom requires the Common Outlaw Keycard, which players can obtain by completing Outlaw Keycard tasks. Once inside, the weapon requires one Dill Bit, a currency found in vaults, dropped by Golden Llamas, or retrieved from keycard-locked boxes in the same backroom with a Legendary Outlaw Keycard. Another place to look is the Seaport City Black Market, where it may spawn, while Rogue Repairs is the known major site. To swiftly obtain Dill Bits, players should prioritize landing near vaults or trains, which are hot drops. Outside of these backrooms, the Lawless Rift Launcher cannot be obtained via floor loot, chest drops, or NPC interactions, necessitating the use of the keycard and Dill Bits. Stock is limited, so arriving early improves your chances. Other Black Markets, such as those in Crime City or Magic Mosses, sell several Exotics but not this launcher, so concentrate your efforts on Rogue Repairs or Seaport City for this particular weapon. The Lawless Rift Launcher launches a projectile that creates a Rift upon hit. With endless ammo and a 22-second recharge time every shot, it\u2019s a mobility tool rather than a damage dealer. To use it, aim at a surface or a player and shoot; the Rift appears quickly and lasts a few seconds. Enter it fast to teleport into the skies over the Rift\u2019s location and relaunch your glider for repositioning. To evade enemies quickly, shoot it toward your feet or adjacent ground, particularly in wide regions or against snipers. Players are utilizing it for trick shots and fight enemies. Aim directly at an enemy to Rift them into the sky, causing them to glide and exposing them to follow-up shots; pair it with a red-dot AR, like as the Holo Twister, to snipe them midair. Alternatively, fire close enemies to flush them out of cover, then surprise them as they reposition. Some people utilize it for spectacular kills: rifle an enemy upward, then fire a no-scope shotgun blast as they fall. Its unpredictability confuses opponents, offering you an advantage in fight when timed correctly. Fortnite\u2019s Icon Series skins have emerged as a cultural sensation, seamlessly connecting the realms of gaming and real-world stardom by bringing celebrities, athletes, and streamers into the vibrant world of battle royale. Since its debut in 2019 alongside DJ Marshmello, the series has evolved to feature an impressive lineup of personalities, ranging from global icons such as Ariana Grande to esports titans like Ninja. For streamers, these skins transcend mere cosmetics as they stand as a testament to their influence within the Fortnite community, rewarding their dedication with a lasting digital legacy. Prominent figures such as Tyler \u201cNinja\u201d Blevins and Kyle \u201cBugha\u201d Giersdorf have stepped into Fortnite, showcasing their in-game skins that captivate fans with bespoke designs mirroring their distinct identities. These partnerships frequently introduce exclusive bundles packed with emotes, pickaxes, and back bling, turning them into must-have items for players. As Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 moves further into its wild Lawless theme, the weapons meta is heating up, enthralling players and shaking up the battle royale scene. This season, which debuted on February 21, 2025, has already offered a wild arsenal customized to its heist-focused narrative, with vault-busting gadgets and close-range brawlers dominating early strategies. Melee weapons initially dominated the scene, infuriating some competitive players with their overpowering presence, but a transition is beginning as new firepower emerges to threaten the status quo. Exotic and Mythic weapons have begun to appear in the loot pool, with standouts like Midas' Gilded Eye Drum Gun have stirred controversy about their suitability for the season's fast-paced, close-quarters fighting. However, the latest addition\u2014a dual-wield marvel called the Pump and Dump\u2014is creating the most excitement. This shotgun-SMG hybrid promises to alter encounters and add a new twist to Fortnite's love for creative weaponry. As players scramble to adapt, the Pump and Dump's debut portends a potential meta shift, with the option of dominating load-outs or fading into oblivion. Here's how you can get your hands on the weapon. Where to get Pump & Dump in Fortnite and how to use it Fortnite has dominated the battle royale genre since its launch in 2017, growing into a cultural behemoth that keeps players engaged with its ever-changing island and inventive in-game events. Epic Games has mastered the art of keeping its enormous community engaged by battling it out in lively POIs and cooperating on creative challenges. Among its most popular services are in-game quest events, which combine cooperative gaming with enticing rewards, converting casual players into dedicated questers. These events, which are sometimes linked to seasonal releases or high-profile collaborations, have become a pillar of Fortnite's popularity, giving anything from exclusive emotes to highly sought-after cosmetic goods. The most recent example is the Spring Raid event, which began on March 14, 2025, and has sparked enthusiasm among players, attracting squads ready to take on its challenges and capture its rewards. The event is in full swing, with participants coming together to complete its objectives, motivated by the prospect of loot and the excitement of collaboration. This time, Epic has upped the ante by incorporating a crossover with the popular animated series Invincible, featuring a fan-favorite character in the rewards selection - Dupli-Kate.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Published onMarch 31, 2025 When Google added the Deep Research option to Gemini, I tested it right away. That was back in December, and my conclusion was that it was somewhat of a hit and miss. While the feature worked well for relatively basic inquiries, in-depth research on recent and slightly more complicated topics proved challenging for it. Recently, Google announced the new and improved Deep Research, which is now based on the Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model. But how much has it improved, and can it now handle more complex research tasks? I tested it to find out. If you\u2019re already familiar with Deep Research, feel free to skip to the next section. Otherwise, read on. Deep Research is designed to save you time when researching a specific topic. For example, let\u2019s say you want to learn about all the components that go into a smartphone and their functions. This would typically require extensive online searching and reading multiple sources, likely leaving you with additional questions and continuing the cycle. It can be a very time-consuming and somewhat frustrating process, at least in my experience. Deep Research aims to do that work for you. Tell the chatbot you\u2019re interested in learning more about smartphone components and their functions, and voil\u00e0, Deep Research will generate a comprehensive report. It scans dozens of sources in minutes and presents the findings on one page. The best part is that if you don\u2019t understand something, you can ask the chatbot to simplify it. If you have additional questions, just ask away. So basically, instead of opening countless tabs and getting lost in your research, you can manage everything within a single interface much more quickly. Well, at least that\u2019s the theory. That\u2019s how Deep Research should work, but in my initial testing, I encountered a few issues that I hope Google has now resolved. The good news is that while Deep Research was initially available only to Gemini Advanced users, the latest update makes it available for free to everyone. So if you have a Google account, you can try out the feature for yourself. Research is something I enjoy, so I was excited to see how much better Deep Research has become. To test this properly, I\u2019ll use the same prompts I used during my first review of the feature. This will provide a clear comparison and show how much it has \u2014 or hasn\u2019t \u2014 improved. The first test I ran was regarding the stock market, which I enjoy following as a finance enthusiast. Deep Research should technically be a great tool for providing a summary of a specific trading day, potentially saving a lot of time. Researching via Google Search, for instance, often requires visiting multiple websites to gather information, and even then, some questions might remain unanswered. My first attempt with Deep Research yielded unimpressive results, making this an excellent test to see the tool\u2019s improvement. This is the prompt I used: Provide me with a comprehensive overview of the stock market performance for Friday, the 28th of March, which should include:  I\u2019m happy to report a significant difference between the first version of Deep Research and the latest one. The new version is much faster, providing the report in 2 minutes and 44 seconds, compared to the four and a half minutes required by the original version. Interestingly, it used fewer sources (46 vs. 73) but categorized them into those used for the report and those consulted but ultimately set aside. Despite using fewer sources, the end result was vastly superior; the provided report was almost exactly what I requested. This time, there were no glaring errors. For example, I asked for the performance of the top 10 S&P 500 companies by market cap, and the report included the correct information. When I first tested Deep Research in December with the same request, the report included only 9 instead of 10 companies, none of which were among the 10 biggest in the US. Furthermore, percentage changes were missing for four of those listed, rendering the information useless. So, Deep Research performed substantially better on this task, although it wasn\u2019t perfect. While it correctly identified the top-performing stocks in the S&P 500, it omitted some of the underperforming ones. Therefore, while not flawless, the report offered significant value, unlike the useless one generated by the first version. Moving on to my second test, I asked Gemini to research different styles of interior design and color schemes and which ones are best suited for a small apartment in a modern building. I need to furnish my new apartment, so this is a topic I\u2019ve been very interested in lately. This task should theoretically be simpler for Gemini than the stock market analysis. It performed well during my initial testing, but the new version of Deep Research takes things to a new level. The report I received was much more detailed this time and included a wealth of valuable information. However, one major issue remains: the lack of images. A report discussing interior styles should ideally include images, but it currently does not. When I asked Gemini to provide images, it stated it couldn\u2019t display them in this format, which is unfortunate. Some reports are fine with text only, but others, like this one, would be greatly enhanced by images. Otherwise, I have to search for visuals myself using Google Search or Pinterest. The core idea behind Deep Research is to consolidate information within one interface, eliminating the need to manually visit multiple sources. Hopefully, this feature will roll out soon, although there\u2019s no guarantee. For my third test, I asked Gemini to research the topic of AI chatbots and detail which ones exist, their capabilities and limitations, their costs, and the future outlook for them. Deep Research performed better than the first time, providing a more in-depth look at the topic. The report takes longer to read, but it offers more substantial value. It provided detailed information on chatbot types, major market players, their capabilities, limitations, and other relevant points. Generally, I was very satisfied with the report provided. Based on my testing, the new and improved Deep Research feature is very effective. It\u2019s much better than the original model released in December. While the original version struggled with specific research tasks \u2014 like the stock market overview \u2014 the new one handled them a lot better. Sure, it isn\u2019t perfect, and there might be other limitations I haven\u2019t encountered, but based on my hands-on experience, it\u2019s a tool many people will find beneficial. Whether you\u2019re doing research for school or a personal project, I\u2019d advise you to try it out and see how well it works for you. It\u2019s free, so there\u2019s nothing to lose. It\u2019s remarkable how much Deep Research has advanced in just a few months. AI is rapidly evolving, so one can only imagine how much better Gemini and features like Deep Research will become in a year or two. Have you tried the improved version of Deep Research yet?

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Apple has been fined \u20ac150 million ($162 million) by France's Competition Authority over the implementation of its App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework (via Bloomberg). The French regulator concluded that the way Apple deployed its ATT feature constitutes an abuse of market dominance, finding that the system unnecessarily complicated the process for users to opt out of tracking and unfairly disadvantaged third-party developers and advertising providers. Introduced in 2021 with iOS 14.5, the ATT framework requires apps to request user consent via a pop-up before tracking activity across other apps and websites. If users decline, the app is denied access to the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), which is typically used for delivering personalized ads. The regulator emphasized that while the ATT framework itself is not inherently anticompetitive, its implementation by Apple resulted in a lack of neutrality. In its published decision, the authority said that the system was \"neither necessary nor proportionate to the company's stated goal to protect user data\" and added that the method Apple used to prompt consent introduced unnecessary friction for third-party developers. Apple's own advertising services are integrated directly into iOS and were not subject to the same user journey, raising concerns that Apple had leveraged its platform control to favor its own interests. The decision also cited the economic consequences for app publishers and advertising providers. Since many developers of free, ad-supported apps depend on targeted advertising for revenue, the enforcement of ATT in its current form was determined to have caused financial harm, particularly to smaller publishers with limited access to first-party data.  The investigation was launched in 2021 following a complaint lodged by a coalition of French advertising trade associations, including Alliance Digitale and the Internet Advertising Syndicate. Though the Competition Authority initially declined to impose emergency interim measures that year, it proceeded with a full probe into ATT's competitive effects. The final ruling compels Apple to pay the \u20ac150 million fine and to publicly publish the decision on its website for a duration of seven days. In a statement, Apple defended its actions and reiterated its commitment to user privacy: App Tracking Transparency gives users more control of their privacy through a required, clear, and easy-to-understand prompt about one thing: tracking. That prompt is consistent for all developers, including Apple, and we have received strong support for this feature from consumers, privacy advocates, and data protection authorities around the world. Apple also noted that the French authority has not mandated any specific changes to the ATT system, instead placing the onus on the company to ensure its compliance with competition law. Apple expressed disappointment with the decision but did not indicate whether it would appeal the fine. The ruling adds to a growing list of investigations into Apple's ATT framework across Europe. Authorities in Germany, Italy, Romania, and Poland have opened similar probes to examine whether the privacy feature violates competition rules by impeding access to essential data for advertising while reinforcing Apple's own position in the digital ad market.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"        Camila Domonoske                        A Boston Dynamics robot \"dog\" inspects a vehicle body as part of quality control during a media tour at the Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America in Ellabell, Ga., on March 26. During the grand opening ceremony for the plant, which actually produced its first vehicle in October, company executives and Georgia politicians did not emphasize \u2014 or even mention \u2014 that the plant produces electric vehicles.                                                           Mike Stewart\/AP                                       hide caption  A few years ago, Hyundai Motor Group triumphantly announced it would be opening a new plant near Savannah, Ga. \u2014 a plant that would exclusively make electric vehicles. \"We heard the clarion call of [the Biden] administration to hasten the adoption of new electric vehicles and reduce carbon emissions,\" Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, then the CEO of Hyundai Motor North America, said in 2022. But at the plant's grand opening last week, as executives and politicians praised Hyundai's multibillion-dollar investment in the region, the thousands of jobs that come with it, and the plant's advanced manufacturing technology, something was conspicuously missing from all the speeches. The word \"electric\" wasn't mentioned once. That's not just a shift in rhetoric. Over the last few years, Hyundai has changed its plans: Instead of being a dedicated EV plant, it will also make hybrids. \"When we started this project, originally, everybody thought, 'OK, the world is going to be fully electric,\" Mu\u00f1oz told reporters after the grand opening ceremony. (He's now the CEO of the entire global company.) \"We were also thinking that way. But soon we realized that the pace of electrification was not going to be as fast as everybody thought.\" EV sales grew slower than companies had anticipated. Hybrids, meanwhile, took off. \"So then very quickly, we decided we're going to produce also hybrid vehicles here,\" Mu\u00f1oz said. This trend is happening industrywide. Companies such as Ford, GM and Volvo have all slowed some EV plans and focused more on hybrids. It's hard to ignore that this is happening as the government is pulling a U-turn on EVs. Under President Trump, regulations that would push automakers to make EVs are being rewritten, tax breaks helping consumers buy them are at risk, and funds for EV chargers are frozen. Some EV advocates have been alarmed about what this could mean for sales. During a Zoom call with reporters on the day of the opening ceremony, Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, congratulated Hyundai but also warned: \"The Trump administration's war on EVs poses a serious threat to EV sales, to the electric vehicle industry and the EV market, and therefore to the state of Georgia.\" Hyundai executives, for their part, are adamant that government policy never drove their decisions in the first place. \"Building plants on the assumption of incentives is not a good decision,\" Mu\u00f1oz says. If the government changes plans \u2014 as indeed it has \u2014 \"What am I going to say? 'Hey, we invested $12.6 billion, so I made a mistake, I'm sorry?' No.\" Still, it's undeniable that government policy can influence sales. Tax rebates and abundant chargers can change what people buy. So while Hyundai's shift toward hybrids started before Trump took office, it's fortuitous timing now. Similarly, the expansion is not a response to tariffs; these plans were in place long before Trump announced a new 25% tariff on imported cars. But as Kia COO Steve Center put it, the timing turned out to be \"convenient.\" (Kia is part of Hyundai Motor Group and will also build vehicles at the new plant.) To be clear, the auto industry isn't giving up on EVs. Hyundai's electrified vehicles have sold well, and automakers like to emphasize that EVs are quiet, fun to drive and cheap to maintain. And \u2014 less important to consumers, but top of mind for companies \u2014 automakers fear that if they don't invest in EVs, they'll cede an entire market segment to the Chinese companies leaning into them. But automakers are pulling back, slowing down and talking about their EV plans in more measured tones. Or, when they're onstage at a grand opening, not talking about them at all.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"New Jersey-based AI and cloud computing company CoreWeave made its market debut on Friday to little applause. The stock was poised for success by all means: It was the biggest tech IPO since software company UiPath (PATH) in 2021, and a rare IPO of a pure-play AI company. Plus, it was backed by market-favorite tech giant Nvidia (NVDA), which ended up having to anchor the IPO last minute with a $250 million order. But things didn\u2019t pan out as expected. The company had initially targeted a $2.7 billion raise but ended up coming in at $1.5 billion instead. The shares priced at $40, well below the $47 to $50 price range expected previously, and started trading on Friday at $39. On Monday, the stock\u2019s second day of trading, the shares were down almost 10% in midday trading. CoreWeave is a cloud computing company that provides GPU infrastructure to major tech names like Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META). The company primarily uses Nvidia\u2019s GPUs to run these data centers. Due to the costly nature of the business, CoreWeave relies on accumulating debt to build its capacity, relying on future demand for AI computing power. CoreWeave is considered a pure-play AI company because the company\u2019s success bets directly on the future of AI demand growth. Most pure-play AI companies \u2014 like OpenAI, which kicked off the AI craze in 2022 with ChatGPT \u2014 are privately held and  don\u2019t publicly disclose finances, which makes it tough for investors to have a gauge on the industry as a whole. CoreWeave\u2019s market debut was seen by many as a way to understand how the AI trade was going amidst rising fears of an AI bubble. Some industry experts think the stock\u2019s disappointing IPO should be an indicator that the hype is subsiding. \u201c[If] a year ago CoreWeave had gone public, the words \u2018AI\u2019 and \u2018Nvidia\u2019 would have been enough to carry it over the line. The fact that it\u2019s not able to do it now is an indicator that the momentum of just trading based on the words AI or Nvidia are not working anymore,\u201d NYU Stern School of Business professor of finance Aswath Damodaran told CNBC last week, adding that he thinks that\u2019s healthy and that AI has been hyped a bit too much. \u201cThe AI product and service business, which ultimately is what has to pay for all of this, has not taken off in any substantial way. I mean, I\u2019m hard pressed to think about any company making significant money from the AI product and service business,\u201d Damodaran said. For its part, OpenAI expects revenue to more than triple by the end of this year, according to revenue expectations reported by Bloomberg last week, but the company doesn\u2019t anticipate to be cash-flow positive until 2029. Market skepticism of the AI trade began late last year, Damodaran said, and accelerated when Chinese AI startup DeepSeek rattled markets by unveiling a reasoning model that rivaled OpenAI\u2019s for less cost and energy earlier this year. What happened last week with the CoreWeave IPO, Damodaran says, is the market recognizing that \u201ctoo much money\u201d has been spent \u201ctoo far in advance of the actual evidence that the market exists.\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019re at that moment in the AI business where we\u2019re looking for some evidence that AI product and service business will be trillions of dollars rather than hundreds of millions of dollars,\u201d he said. Not all experts agree that the IPO\u2019s disappointment has a direct correlation with the power of the AI trade, though. \u201cWhile the CoreWeave IPO clearly did not go well, it should not be taken as an indication of the strength of the market for AI,\u201d D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Quartz.  Luria thinks that CoreWeave is \u201ca little more than a highly leveraged off balance sheet arrangement for Nvidia,\u201d pointing to Nvidia\u2019s decision to bail out the company\u2019s IPO. CoreWeave\u2019s leveraged spending helps fuel Nvidia\u2019s GPU sales without putting any direct financial risk on Nvidia.  In an initiation note last week, Luria said CoreWeave\u2019s debt-based business model can only be sustainable as long as demand for AI grows \u201cfaster than hyperscalers are able to build data centers,\u201d making CoreWeave a risky investment as is. Regarding speculations of whether or not AI is in a bubble, Luria makes an analogy to the 2008 financial crisis, in which collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) \u2014 particularly, subprime mortgages \u2014 played a huge role in creating a housing bubble.  \u201cIf AI was a CDO, we see CoreWeave as the sub-prime tranche,\u201d Luria wrote. D.A. Davidson currently has a neutral rating on the stock. \u201cThe importance of AI to the future path of technology transcends any one company, and is definitely bigger than CoreWeave,\u201d Luria told Quartz.

Plus, meme coin creators are trying to earn a buck off that weird Studio Ghibli-style AI art trend. And what\u2019s the deal with Ether, the Bitcoin rival that has shed about 43% of its value so far this year?  Here are some cryptocurrencies to watch this week. 2 \/ 6 Is the biggest cryptocurrency a sure thing in 2025? Is anything? Turns out, there\u2019s little to feel certain about in the new\u00a0era of mass layoffs, on-again, off-again tariffs, and stagflation fears. Market uncertainty is one of the things that\u2019s come to define the early days of the second Trump administration, and investors in cryptocurrencies and stocks alike will be looking for some clarity on April 2, when the president is expected to say more about tariffs.  Bitcoin and stock market performance sometimes correlate, but what happens next is really anyone\u2019s guess. What\u2019s clear is that the back-and-forth on tariffs has soured the crypto market so far this year. 3 \/ 6 Washington is still chattering about stablecoins, as Congress works toward passing industry-backed stablecoin rules and Democrats react to the Trump family\u2019s plan to release a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar. While the term implies stability, stablecoins can and do become unstable when they\u2019re unpegged from their target asset or currency. In February, Consumer Reports and other groups asked lawmakers to vote against the brewing House and Senate stablecoin bills, saying they \u201crepresent a crypto industry wish list, not an adequate regulatory regime that provides necessary oversight, customer protection, and stability.\u201d 4 \/ 6 As its rival Solana grows, Ethereum is reportedly shedding developers, and its token Ether is lagging behind Bitcoin.  Since Jan. 1, Ether has cratered about 43% while Bitcoin has slipped about 10%. Ripple\u2019s XRP, meanwhile, may appear to be somewhere else entirely \u2014 up 3.62% on the year, but it\u2019s still vulnerable to chaos. 5 \/ 6 The fleeting boom of AI-generated, Studio Ghibli-style images on social media has triggered interest in meme coins inspired by the beloved animation studio. No matter your feelings about Ghibli or Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s past comments on AI, meme coins in general remain extremely volatile, and the SEC stated in February that it sees meme coins as \u201cakin to collectibles\u201d that \u201ctypically have limited or no use or functionality.\u201d 6 \/ 6","label":1}
{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"After revolutionizing the weight-loss drug market, Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) are setting their sights on heart health. Both pharma giants unveiled new clinical trial results over the weekend, highlighting potential cardiovascular benefits of their medications. Novo Nordisk shared fresh data on semaglutide \u2014 the active ingredient in its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy. One study found that a weekly 2.4 mg dose led to a 20% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events \u2014 such as heart attack, stroke, or death \u2014 among overweight or obese patients with existing cardiovascular disease, compared with a control group. Another study examined its daily semaglutide pill, Rybelsus, which showed a 14% reduction in the risk of major cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes and some combination of cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease, compared with a placebo. Novo Nordisk\u2019s chief rival, Eli Lilly, also released new heart health data. It said its experimental drug lepodisiran lowered levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) \u2014 a particle linked to cardiovascular disease \u2014 by 94% with a single injection. About 20% of Americans have high levels of Lp(a), which can double the risk of a heart attack and is linked with conditions like stroke and aortic valve stenosis. However, it remains unclear whether lowering Lp(a) levels translates into fewer heart attacks and strokes and large-scale clinical trials are underway to answer that question. These latest findings build on previous efforts by both companies to explore their medications\u2019 effects on heart health. \u201cNovo Nordisk continues to evolve its focus beyond diabetes and obesity towards a broader spectrum of metabolic and cardiovascular health,\u201d Martin Holst Lange, the company\u2019s executive vice president for development, said in a press release. Earlier this month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration expanded Wegovy\u2019s approved use after Novo Nordisk announced that the drug cut the risk of serious heart events by 20% in a clinical trial. Meanwhile, in August, Lilly said that tirzepatide \u2014 the active ingredient in its weight-loss drug Zepbound \u2014 helped reduce heart failure risks in obese patients. Patients who took tirzepatide were 38% less likely to be hospitalized, require increased heart failure medication, or die from heart failure compared than those who received a placebo. Novo Nordisk\u2019s shares gained 0.9% in U.S. trading on Monday, while Eli Lilly\u2019s stock declined about 1%.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Moderna (MRNA) and other vaccine maker stocks plummeted during pre-market trading on Monday amid news from this weekend that the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) top vaccine regulator was forced out of the agency. Moderna, known for its mRNA Covid-19 vaccine, dropped 13%, while Novavax (NVAX) and BioNTech (BNTX) both fell more than 9%. Pfizer (PFE) declined nearly 2%. The stock moves come as Peter Marks, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, submitted his resignation letter Friday. In that role, which he had held since 2016, he oversaw the approval of vaccines and other biologic drugs, including gene therapies. The Wall Street Journal first reported, citing unnamed sources, that Marks resigned after an official at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) told him he could either quit or be fired. HHS and the FDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Quartz. In his resignation letter, Marks cited fundamental disagreements with HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines. \u201cAs you are aware, I was willing to work to address the Secretary\u2019s concerns regarding vaccine safety and transparency,\u201d Marks wrote. \u201cHowever, it has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies.\u201d Marks\u2019 resignation takes effect April 5, according to the letter. His departure comes amid a broader restructuring at HHS, which includes roughly 3,500 job cuts at the FDA. This isn\u2019t the first time Kennedy has rattled vaccine stocks. Shares of major vaccine makers also dropped in November after President Donald Trump announced Kennedy as his pick to lead HHS.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Rocket Companies (RKT) stock dropped 7.6% after it unveiled an agreement to acquire Mr. Cooper (COOP) for $9.4 billion in shares, boosting its mortgage servicing portfolio to $2.1 trillion in unpaid balances, or about one in every six U.S. home loans. The shares of Mr. Cooper, a mortgage originator and servicer, jumped about 17% on the news. The firm will pay a $2 per share dividend on completion of the deal. Its shareholders will own about 25% of the combined company, with Rocket\u2019s investors holding 75%. \u201cUltimately, this combination drives higher loan volume and long-term client relationships \u2014 while providing greater recurring revenue and lowering client acquisition costs,\u201d the companies said in a joint statement. The deal is scheduled for completion in the fourth quarter. Earlier this month, Rocket announced the purchase of real estate brokerage Redfin (RDFN) for $1.75 billion in stock, seeking to drive its mortgage business through integration with the target company\u2019s agent network. Rocket Mortgage was the No. 3 mortgage lender in the U.S. by volume last year, closing $101 billion worth of loans, translating to just under a 6% market share, according to the Detroit Free Press (GCI). The leading originators were United Wholesale Mortgage (UWMC), at $139 billion, and PennyMac Financial (PFSI) at $115 billion, the newspaper reported. U.S. existing home sales increased 4.2% in February, but fell 1.2% from a year earlier. Housing inventories jumped 5.1% from January and by 17% from last year. The median existing home price was $398,400, up 3.8% from last year, with all four U.S. regions reporting price increases. Sales of new homes gained 1.8% to an annualized rate of 676,000 units. Home sales are tied to interest rates, and with inflation remaining sticky the Federal Reserve may be constrained from cutting borrowing costs to buoy the economy.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Goldman Sachs just made a dramatically pessimistic shift in its predictions for the U.S. economy and stock market this year in light of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, joining a growing chorus of economists warning the trade war could tilt the U.S. into a recession\u2014and that there\u2019s further pain ahead for equity investors. President Donald Trump could be the author of a recession, some economists warn. Goldman Sachs economists led by Ronnie Walker upped their forecasts for the average tariff rate to rise to 15% on all goods this year in a Sunday note to clients, reflecting Trump\u2019s latest posturing ahead of his Wednesday tariff \u201cLiberation Day\u201d as the president said he\u2019s aiming for even heavier levies than previously expected. That translated into far more bearish economic forecasts for Goldman, which hiked its probability for a recession over the next year from 20% to 35%. The economists raised their end-of-2025 inflation forecast to 3.5% (up from 2.8% last month) their unemployment prediction to 4.5% (highest since October 2021) and its gross domestic product growth forecast to 1% (worst since 2020). Goldman strategists accordingly slashed their expectations for stock market returns, as the David Kostin-led group wrote to clients it expects the S&P 500 benchmark to decline 5% over the next three months, setting a 5,300 price target, and for the index to rise 6% over the next year, setting a 5,900 target. Goldman had a 6,500 year-ahead target for the S&P as recently as Feb. 28, cutting its forecast by nearly 10% in March. 6.3%. That\u2019s how much the S&P was down in March through Friday\u2019s close, trending to its worst month since September 2022. That does not even factor in the index\u2019s more than 1% drop in premarket trading Monday. Trump said Sunday he plans to target \u201call countries\u201d with \u201csubstantial\u201d import taxes on his reciprocal tariffs expected to be announced Wednesday, reversing his assertions last week his upcoming tariffs would be \u201cmore lenient.\u201d Trump and his top economic official, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have both said they won\u2019t rule out a recession, casting the prospect of a downturn as the result of unsustainable economic growth tied to high government spending and slanted trade. But some economists have expressed the Trump administration may needlessly tip the U.S. into a recession. UCLA Anderson School of Management economist Clement Bohr warned Trump earlier this month: \u201cIf all your wishes come true, you could very well be the author of a deep recession.\u201d The prospect of higher inflation tied to tariffs is particularly concerning for financial markets, as sticky high prices may cause the Federal Reserve to rethink further interest rate cuts, which would make borrowing costs pricier, weighing on corporate profit margins and consumer demand.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  WPM Stock Wheaton Precious Metals stock has jumped more than 60% over the past year, while the S&P 500 index has only seen a 9% increase. This performance exceeds that of its competitors, such as Barrick Gold stock (NYSE: GOLD), which rose 19%, and Newmont Corporation (NYSE: NEM), which gained 34% over the same period.   The strong rise in Wheaton\u2019s stock over the past year can be attributed mainly to increasing precious metals prices. Gold and silver prices climbed in 2024 due to factors such as slowing inflation, geopolitical conflicts like the Russia-Ukraine war, and uncertain policy signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve. Wheaton also expanded its output through new streaming agreements, including the Fenix and Kone projects, and gained from better-than-expected gold grades at its existing sites. Additionally, the company boosted its quarterly dividend for 2025, signaling its confidence in continued strong profitability. For investors seeking growth with less volatility than individual stocks, the High Quality portfolio, which has consistently outpaced the S&P, may be worth a look, with returns exceeding 91% since launch. Part of the stock's rise can be credited to a 26% increase in annual revenue in 2024 to $1.3 billion and the maintenance of a robust gross profit margin. The company posted record quarterly operating cash flows of $1.028 billion. While Wheaton experienced strong top-line growth in 2024, its price-to-sales (PS) ratio also climbed from 22x in 2023 to 28x now. This increase aligns with its solid stock gains, likely fueled by higher metal prices, better revenues, or improved investor sentiment toward streaming companies. WPM stock performance over the last four years has not been linear, although it has shown less volatility compared to the S&P 500. Annual returns stood at 4% in 2021, -8% in 2022, 28% in 2023, and 15% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has delivered better consistency and has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 over the same period. Why is that? Stocks in the HQ Portfolio have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the broader market; offering a more stable experience, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Considering today\u2019s uncertain macro environment\u2014including rate cut speculation and ongoing geopolitical tensions\u2014WPM may either follow past underperformance seen in 2021 and 2024 or deliver another strong year. Wheaton Precious Metals delivered a strong Q4 2024, with record revenue and impressive earnings growth. It reported $381 million in Q4 revenue, marking a notable year-over-year gain. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $0.44. Looking ahead, Wheaton expects annual production to rise by 40% to 870,000 gold equivalent ounces (GEOs) by 2029, with 2025 output projected between 600,000 and 670,000 GEOs. In summary, WPM\u2019s strategic initiatives, favorable market dynamics, and solid operational performance have propelled its stock upward over the past year. We currently value the Wheaton Precious Metals valuation at $77 per share, which is in line with the current market price.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Business Insider Edition  Sports prediction markets are under fire \u2014\u00a0and the outcome could be pivotal for the future of US sports betting.          Regulators in Nevada and New Jersey, two of the US's longest-standing gambling markets, sent cease-and-desist orders this month to the futures trading platform Kalshi to stop it from taking trades on sports events. Fintech platform Robinhood, which uses Kalshi's platform to offer sports contracts, also got a cease-and-desist letter in New Jersey, and Massachusetts is investigating the company's sports contracts.               More states seem to be following suit. On Monday, an Ohio regulator said it issued cease-and-desist notices over sports contracts to Kalshi, Robinhood, and Crypto.com.               \"We have been targeted before, we have fought before, and we have won before,\" CEO Tarek Mansour said in a statement to Business Insider. \"This time will be no different.\"               A Robinhood spokesperson also said in a statement that the company doesn't think \"these contracts run afoul of any state laws.\" Robinhood pulled its March Madness contracts from New Jersey, though.       Prediction markets have surged in popularity since the 2024 US presidential election and companies including Kalshi and Crypto.com have expanded into sports events. Sports predictions are similar to betting in that users can put money on the outcome of a game, but those contracts can be traded and typically only include whether a team will win or lose (rather than on player stats or parlays).               Kalshi has driven over $320 million in trading volume on the outcome of the men's March Madness championship alone, according to its website. March Madness is one of the biggest US sports betting events of the year.               While sports gambling is limited to the 39 US jurisdictions where it's been legalized and regulated, sports predictions from Kalshi are being offered in all 50 states. Sports predictions are a major threat \u2014 and opportunity \u2014 for betting operators, some of which have expressed interest in predictions and are likely watching closely to see how Kalshi's regulatory battle plays out.               \"This is a historical legal battle that pits states' traditional authority over gaming and sports betting against whether commodities exchanges regulated by the [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] can include sports betting-like offerings,\" said James Kilsby, chief analyst at Vixio, a regulatory tech company that works with the gambling industry.               Kalshi has sued regulators in Nevada and New Jersey in response to the cease-and-desists. The company argued, in part, that Kalshi is a \"federally regulated exchange\" overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has the sole authority to approve or reject its events contracts, per a March 28 court filing.               It described the ways its sports contracts differ from betting, including that they \"do not reflect a 'bet' against the 'house.'\" (Contrary to that point, some states' sports betting laws cover peer-to-peer betting.)               Ultimately, Kalshi argues that shutting down in Nevada and New Jersey could violate CFTC rules that its events contracts be open, fair, and accessible.               If the courts and the CFTC decide Kalshi's sports contracts are legitimate, it could \"trigger a significant reaction from the sports betting industry,\" Kilsby said.               \"It's almost impossible to imagine a scenario in which FanDuel and DraftKings don't ultimately want to move into that market as well,\" he said. \"I think you'll very quickly see more companies positioning themselves to launch sports exchange platforms under the CFTC guidelines.\"               That said, the legal and regulatory saga will likely last several months, and other hurdles could emerge, legal, regulatory, and gambling insiders told BI.               \"The sports wagering industry is looking at this very carefully, and they're trying to decide,\" said Andrew Kim, an appellate and gaming litigator at Goodwin. \"They have a balancing act right now of not offending the regulators that oversee their prime product but also not missing out on an opportunity to jump to the kind of innovative gray areas that really formed [daily fantasy sports] and all the other sports wagering industries to begin with. \"               More states could oppose sports predictions, as could tribal groups with the authority to conduct gaming on many lands and exclusivity with some states.               Gaming industry consultant Dustin Gouker, who broke the news about the New Jersey cease-and-desists through his Closing Line newsletter, said the letters could be a \"bellwether of what's going to happen next.\"               Sports predictions threaten revenue for states like Nevada and New Jersey. New Jersey, which led the expansion of legal sports betting in the US by appealing a federal ban, brought in over $1 million in sports wagering revenue in January, making it the third largest US market, according to the American Gaming Association.               The issue also undermines states' control over what constitutes sports betting within their borders and what they do and do not allow. The matter could eventually end up at the Supreme Court, depending on where the lower courts and the CFTC land.               And it's hard to ignore that this battle over the states' rights to regulate sports betting is coming at a key moment for the industry: March Madness.               In its cease-and-desist letters, New Jersey's Division of Gaming Enforcement pointed to the state's restrictions on betting on college sports. The state prohibits betting on college games that take place in the state or involve local teams like Rutgers.               \"Other states are looking to what happens here, and whether they're successful, and how Kalshi and Robinhood respond,\" Gouker said.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Instacart has become part of many people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s routines. Statista reports it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the top grocery delivery companies in the United States and Canada, generating over $850 million in revenue from the U.S. alone in the third quarter of 2024. The delivery app is a time-saver, but using it can be a gamble if the product you want is out of stock. Now, the popular delivery service is making changes to address this issue.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 Food & Wine reports that Instacart is releasing two new AI features: Store View and Second Store Check. The former is meant to improve the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current inventory prediction technology and keep up with inventory updates using video data. Footage of grocery store aisles will be recorded by eligible Instacart workers on the job; the AI tool will then review the videos to come up with accurate inventory counts. Second Store Check is a tool that goes the extra mile when customers can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find the item they want and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want a substitute. In this case, the Instacart app will notify another worker at a different store location to look for the out-of-stock product.\u00c2\u00a0 Instacart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s press release explains that one of the biggest challenges in the grocery industry is keeping up with inventory because there are usually over 30,000 items in a single store. An ECR Retail Loss Group report shows that up to 60 percent of inventory records have errors, leading to unsatisfied shoppers and fewer purchases. The authors also share that correcting these inaccuracies can lead to a four to eight percent increase in sales. Instacart shares that Store View will be released with select retailers over the next few weeks. The company also has plans to expand the feature to more U.S. grocers and Canadian stores throughout the year.\u00c2\u00a0 This wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be the first time Instacart has experimented with AI. The company launched  Caper Carts, its AI-powered shopping baskets, in 2024. They come with cameras, a scale, and sensors to detect what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s placed in the carts. Instacart also released Smart Shop, a dietary recommendation feature, in March 2025. Read More About Grocery Shopping: \u00c2\u00a9 2025 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved","label":0}

The price of gold just hit a record high\u2014soaring past $3,100 per ounce\u2014and experts say it could climb even higher. But what does that mean for you? Whether you have a few old gold rings or a collection of heirloom pieces, here\u2019s what you need to know about selling gold right now. Allkindza\/Getty  Gold prices have increased due to economic uncertainty, inflation concerns and strong central bank demand.\u00a0 Investors tend to flock to gold during uncertain times, which has pushed prices up nearly 18% this year alone, according to Reuters.\u00a0 And with some analysts predicting gold could hit $4,500 in the next 12 months, it\u2019s no surprise that people are rushing to sell their gold. Pakin Songmor\/Getty Not all gold is created equal. The price you get depends on several factors. One key factor is the karat value. Pure gold is 24K, but most jewelry is 10K, 14K, or 18K.\u00a0 You can check the karat value of your gold jewelry at home by looking for a stamp or hallmark on the inside of rings or the clasp of necklaces and bracelets. If the marking is unclear, you can also use a gold testing kit, which typically includes acid solutions that react differently depending on the gold\u2019s purity. Another important factor is weight, as gold is priced per ounce, meaning heavier pieces are worth more. Market prices also play a role, since gold prices fluctuate and timing can affect your payout.\u00a0 Additionally, there is a difference between jewelry and scrap gold. Designer and antique pieces may be worth more than just their gold content. Martin Diebel\/Getty Yes\u2014gold coins and gold bars can often be more valuable than jewelry, especially if they\u2019re made of high-purity gold (typically 22K or 24K) and have collectible or historical significance.\u00a0 Unlike many gold jewelry pieces, which are mixed with other metals and influenced by design trends, coins and bars are valued primarily for their weight and purity, making them easier to appraise and sell at market value. If you own gold bullion or certified coins like American Eagles or Canadian Maple Leafs, you may be sitting on a highly liquid asset that\u2019s in demand when gold prices surge. Maica\/Getty If you\u2019re ready to turn your gold into cash, there are several options available. One option is to visit local jewelers or gold buyers. Many jewelry stores and pawn shops buy gold on the spot, so it\u2019s a good idea to get quotes from multiple buyers to ensure you receive a fair price. Another option is to use online gold buyers.\u00a0 Websites like Worthy, Cash for Gold USA and Express Gold Cash allow you to mail in your gold for an appraisal and payout, offering a convenient way to sell from home. If you have a unique or vintage piece, selling through an auction site may be the best choice. Platforms like eBay or an online auction house can help you reach a wider audience and potentially get a higher price for your gold jewelry. Want more trending money-saving news? Click here!

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  GLW Stock Corning (NYSE:GLW) recently announced the launch of its GlassWorks AI solutions, which includes customized data center products, such as high-density cables and Multi-Mode Connector-based assemblies. This product range will help accelerate the deployment of high-density data center interconnects and aid the company\u2019s top line growth.   Now, looking at GLW stock, we find it to be a good pick to buy at its current price of around $46. Although there are some concerns regarding Corning\u2019s past performance, and its current valuation looks slightly high, we think the company is poised for strong growth in the coming quarters.   We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of GLW stock with its operating performance over the recent years, as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Corning along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a moderate operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, GLW stock looks slightly expensive compared to the broader market. \u2022 Corning has a price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 3.3 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500  \u2022 Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P\/EBIT) ratio is 37.7 compared to 24.3 for S&P 500  \u2022 And, it has a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 22.1 vs. the benchmark's 24.3 Corning\u2019s Revenues have declined marginally over recent years. \u2022 Corning has seen its top line shrink at an average rate of 2.1% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.3% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Its revenues have grown 4.2% from $12.6 Bil to $13.1 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Also, its quarterly revenues grew 16.9% to $3.5 Bil in the most recent quarter from $3.0 Bil a year ago (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500) Corning's profit margins are around the median level for companies in the Trefis coverage universe. \u2022 Corning's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $1.1 Bil, which represents a moderate Operating Margin of 8.7% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Corning's Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $1.9 Bil, pointing to a moderate OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 14.8% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500)  Corning's balance sheet looks strong. \u2022 Corning's Debt figure was $8.1 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $39 Bil (as of 3\/28\/2025). This implies a strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 18.9% (vs. 19.0% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable]  \u2022 Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $1.8 Bil of the $28 Bil in Total Assets for Corning. This yields a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 6.4% (vs. 14.8% for S&P 500) GLW stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. \u2022 GLW stock fell 32.4% from a high of $42.95 on 9 February 2022 to $29.02 on 2 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 8 July 2024  \u2022 Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $54.25 on 26 January 2025 and currently trades at around $46 \u2022 GLW stock fell 37.3% from a high of $28.29 on 20 February 2020 to $17.75 on 23 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 16 July 2020 \u2022 GLW stock fell 71.8% from a high of $27.77 on 19 May 2008 to $7.82 on 20 November 2008, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 1 March 2017 In summary, Corning's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: \u2022 Growth: Neutral  \u2022 Profitability: Neutral  \u2022 Financial Stability: Strong  \u2022 Downturn Resilience: Very Weak  \u2022 Overall: Neutral Although Corning's past performance has been moderate and its current valuation is somewhat high, we see compelling reasons for future growth. The recent strong performance in optical communications, boosted by the rising demand for AI technologies, combined with the introduction of a new range of products, leads us to expect significantly better sales growth for Corning in the next few years compared to the previous three. This positive outlook reinforces our view that GLW is a good buy, even with its slightly elevated valuation. While GLW stock looks like a good pick, you could explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid- and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Business Insider Edition  A fire broke out at a Tesla dealership in Rome early on Monday, destroying 17 cars and damaging the building, firefighters told Business Insider.          Emergency services were called to the site in Torre Angela at about 4:30 a.m. local time, they said.               No injuries have been reported and investigators haven't specified the cause of the fire, adding investigators were looking into multiple causes, including possible malice.               Local reports say Teslas have been vandalized in other parts of Rome in recent weeks, with some defaced with black spray paint.               Tesla Showroom Rome didn't immediately reply to a request for comments.               The incident comes as CEO Elon Musk's aggressive cost-cutting efforts at DOGE have sparked a backlash against his EV maker.               Over the past three months, Tesla facilities have faced arson attacks, vandalism,\u00a0and boycott calls in the US and Europe. Tesla stock\u00a0fell another 5% on Monday, extending the decline this year to 34%. JPMorgan analysts recently slashed their price target to just $135.               Business Insider's Lakshmi Varanasi reported she saw nearly 400 protesters armed with flags and signs outside a Tesla showroom in Ann Arbor, Michigan, on Saturday. They were calling for Musk to leave the White House.               The Tesla and SpaceX CEO has said he's shocked by the violence, calling it \"insane and deeply wrong\" in an X post earlier this month: \"Tesla just makes electric cars and has done nothing to deserve these evil attacks.\"               In another post, Musk wrote: \"Has there ever been such a level of coordinated violence against a peaceful company? I understand not wanting to buy a product, but this is extreme arson and destruction!\"               Steven Callander, a professor of political economy at Stanford Graduate School of Business, previously told BI the backlash for his political actions was \"inevitable,\" saying the \"real cost to Tesla will be the lost sales and the brand damage\" \u2014 not the vandalism.               New Tesla registrations in the US tumbled 11% in January \u2014 even as Ford's EV sales soared 54% \u2014 and the picture was worse in Europe as sales plunged more than 40% in February, industry reports show. Tesla shares are down 45% from their December high.               Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, made a similar observation in a note last week, saying: \"Musk leading DOGE has essentially taken on a life of its own, as in the process Tesla has unfortunately become a political symbol globally.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Business Insider Edition  Throughout his college studies, Ryan Kim always had a postgraduation game plan. First it was to become a database manager. Then it was to break into fintech as a business analyst. But during his sophomore and junior years, as the tech industry laid off nearly half a million workers, Kim struggled to secure an internship. So he set his eyes on a new career: public service.          Kim was far from the only Gen Zer making the same pivot. Last year, according to the job site Handshake, the share of applications it received from college seniors for entry-level openings in tech dropped by 19% from 2022, while the share to jobs in government nearly doubled. Even younger kids saw the writing on the wall. In surveys, high school students used to cite tech giants like Google and Apple as the places they most wanted to work. But last year, in a startling shift, both the FBI and NASA ranked higher than any of those tech companies. Silicon Valley was out. Capitol Hill was in.               It took Kim only a single application to land a yearlong paid internship at the Food and Drug Administration. His performance reviews were good, and he planned to stay on at the agency after he earned his degree in May. \"You hear so many horror stories of people in tech being laid off with little notice,\" he tells me. \"Government jobs are secure. What drew me into it was the stability.\"               So much for that plan.               This month, with his graduation fast approaching, Kim abruptly lost his internship amid the government-wide havoc Elon Musk has unleashed at DOGE. With most federal hiring on an indefinite hold, he's been scrambling to find a job \u2014 any job. \"It's been a huge source of stress,\" he says. \"Most of the private industry has already hired their graduating students.\"               Kim is one of the roughly 2 million students set to graduate this spring into an exceptionally shaky job market. Things were already looking tough for the class of 2025, given the steep hiring slump in industries like tech, finance, and consulting. But now, as Musk takes a chainsaw to the government, many college seniors are in panic mode. Some have seen their offers at federal agencies rescinded; others have received no word on jobs they applied to months ago.               It's not just government positions that are taking a hit \u2014 it's jobs at a whole host of businesses, nonprofits, and universities that rely on federal funding and contracts. And going to graduate school \u2014 the traditional backup plan for students during times of economic instability \u2014 may not even be an option, if the Department of Education winds up being unable to deliver financial aid in a timely fashion. As the government is slashed to the bone in the name of efficiency, the careers of many Gen Zers could suffer for years to come.               \"The impact is broad scale,\" says Saskia Campbell, the executive director of university career services at George Mason University. \"There is this sense of grief, of loss of opportunity. This is the first year I'm actually concerned.\"               To make matters worse, the outlook is likely to get even more dismal in the months ahead, as President Donald Trump's tariff wars spur companies to hold off on hiring. \"Two years ago, the bulk of the uncertainty and fear was in Big Tech,\" says Briana Randall, the executive director of the career and internship center at the University of Washington. \"Now it feels uncertain in a lot of areas.\"               All of that leaves America's soon-to-be new grads unsure of where to turn. Sarina Parsapasand, a public policy major who's graduating from the University of Southern California this spring, was hoping to land a job in government service. But now, given the chaos in Washington, she's switched to trying to land a job in the private sector. \"I have bills to pay,\" she says. \"I can't take the risk of being in a job that doesn't guarantee the stability for me to live my life.\"               It's a sentiment I hear over and over again from the students I speak with. \"The job market just seems super unstable in almost any field,\" says Katie Schwartz, a sophomore at Tulane. \"It's less about finding a job you really love now and more just about finding a job that's going to give you job stability.\"               I'm impressed by the clear-eyed pragmatism of these students \u2014 but I'm also saddened by how old they sound. Isn't job stability what you look for when you're middle-aged, with a mortgage to pay and kids to support? When I graduated from college in 2009 without a full-time job, I was panicked but still idealistic. These kids, in contrast, seem hardened by all the chaos they've endured from a young age. In high school, they watched their parents get laid off in the pandemic. In college, they watched older students struggle to land good jobs during the tech downturn \u2014 or worse, had their hard-won offers rescinded at the last minute.               The upheaval and uncertainty have taught today's graduates to prepare for the worst. Over the past year, one college senior tells me, she's been intentionally neglecting her studies so she could focus exclusively on her job search, sending out as many as 15 applications a day. The hustle paid off with three offers, including one she accepted from a government contractor. It's her \"dream job,\" she says, because it would enable her to make a real difference in the world.               But now, given the chaos in Washington, she's leaning toward reneging on the offer and accepting a position at a finance company. (That's why she asked me not to use her name.) \"I try to keep an optimistic outlook,\" she tells me. But when I ask her how she feels about taking her first steps into adulthood, she doesn't sound optimistic at all.               \"It makes me pretty nervous,\" she says. \"I think a lot of people in my generation have accepted that we're not going to live the same quality of life our parents provided us.\"               During hard economic times, we expect to hear stories about people losing their jobs. But the greatest casualties often end up being the young people who don't have jobs to lose in the first place. Hiring freezes hurt them the most, making it impossible for them to even get their foot in the door. And research shows just how long a shadow that can cast on someone's career. Five years after the Great Recession, my generation of millennials was earning 11% less than Gen Xers were at a comparable age. And our net worth fell 40% behind theirs, forcing us to delay many of life's biggest milestones: buying a home, starting a family, saving for retirement.               The effects go far beyond money. Students who graduated into the 1982 recession, for example, wound up with fewer kids and more divorces than those who entered better job markets. Even more shocking, the research shows, they were more likely to die early. Whatever gains in efficiency Trump hopes to achieve from DOGE, its most lasting legacy may end up being the harm it inflicts on the careers \u2014 and perhaps even the life spans \u2014 of his youngest constituents.               That leaves college seniors like Kim scrambling to find a foothold in a job market that is stacked against them. Many companies have already filled their entry-level positions, if they're hiring new grads at all. And he's now competing not only with his fellow students, but also with the flood of young government workers who have been laid off by DOGE \u2014 workers who have more experience than he does. As graduation nears, he's trying not to panic. But it's hard to retain a sense of hope when even lower-paying jobs in public service are no longer an option.               \"I'm not sure how my future's going to turn out,\" Kim tells me. And that, when you think about it, is a future that should worry us all.       Aki Ito is a chief correspondent for Business Insider.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  AXP Stock   Question: How would you react if you held American Express stock (NYSE: AXP) and its value dropped by 50% or more in the near future? While this might seem dramatic, it's not unprecedented and could occur again. American Express shares have underperformed so far this year, falling 7% since early January, compared to a 3% decline for the S&P 500 over the same period. Despite a stronger-than-expected Q4 2024 performance\u2014driven by increased payment volumes and higher fee-related income\u2014several challenges may lie ahead. Negative sentiment in the market has risen due to fears of a U.S. recession, spurred by tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump on key trade partners. This poses a risk to American Express, given its reliance on consumer spending and international travel trends. Here\u2019s the point: The key message is that in a downturn, American Express stock could suffer significant losses. In 2020, AXP stock lost nearly 50% of its value in just a few quarters and declined about 32% during the 2022 inflation crisis\u2014slightly worse than the S&P 500. This raises the concern: could AXP fall to $135 from the current $270 if similar conditions arise? Naturally, individual stocks tend to be more volatile than diversified portfolios. So, if you're aiming for growth with lower volatility, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outpaced the S&P 500 with a total return of over 91% since inception. President Donald Trump\u2019s strict tariff policies\u2014including a 20% tariff on Chinese goods and 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, as well as tighter immigration rules\u2014have sparked fears that inflation might return. This suggests the U.S. economy could face major challenges, including a possible recession\u2014see our analysis here on the macro picture. In an interview earlier this month, the President even acknowledged that new tariffs could lead to a recession. Considering the increased uncertainty brought on by these policies, the risks become particularly concerning. In addition, the Ukraine\u2013Russia war and ongoing trade disputes worldwide further cloud the economic horizon. Higher import costs caused by tariffs typically lead to increased prices, which reduce disposable income and dampen consumer spending. This could negatively affect American Express in multiple ways. Rising prices may prompt consumers to reduce discretionary spending, which would hurt transaction volumes on the company\u2019s network. If a recession follows, job losses and declining incomes could reduce spending and payment activity further. Businesses, facing higher expenses, may cut their budgets\u2014resulting in lower corporate expenditures and fewer business-related transactions. American Express has a larger exposure to the travel and entertainment segments than its competitors, and these categories tend to see steeper declines during economic slowdowns. Much of the company\u2019s recent growth has stemmed from increased spending by millennials and Gen Z in these areas. During the holiday quarter, travel and entertainment billings grew by 11%, outpacing the 8% increase seen in goods and services. AXP stock has underperformed the S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. Concerned about the impact of a market crash on AXP? Visit our dashboard How Low Can American Express Stock Go In A Market Crash? for an in-depth look at how the stock has behaved in past market crashes. \u2022 AXP stock declined 32.0% from a peak of $198.38 on February 16, 2022, to $134.91 on October 2, 2022, compared to a 25.4% drop in the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully rebounded to its pre-crisis high by January 26, 2024  \u2022 It then climbed to $325.87 on January 23, 2025, and now trades around $270 \u2022 AXP stock dropped 49.6% from $136.93 on February 19, 2020, to $68.96 on March 23, 2020, versus a 33.9% fall for the S&P 500  \u2022 It recovered fully to its pre-pandemic high by February 23, 2021 \u2022 AXP stock plunged 83.8% from $63.23 on October 14, 2007, to $10.26 on March 8, 2009, compared to a 56.8% decline in the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis level by March 5, 2013 At a current price of approximately $270 per share, AXP trades at about 18x expected 2025 earnings\u2014a valuation that appears reasonable. Though the company is seeing steady revenue growth, it\u2019s not spectacular. Analysts expect roughly 8% annual revenue growth for both FY\u201925 and FY\u201926. The company's wealthier clientele may provide some cushion during economic slumps, but its strong reliance on discretionary sectors such as travel and entertainment exposes it to risk during downturns. Moreover, American Express has ramped up its marketing spend\u2014jumping 16% in 2024 to roughly $6 billion\u2014which could pressure margins further if the economy weakens. Given the uncertain growth outlook and broader economic risks, ask yourself: Would you continue to hold AXP stock, or would you sell if it starts dropping toward $135 or below? Holding a falling stock is never easy.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Musk is accused of misleading investors when he bought Twitter stock in 2022. The Securities and Exchange Commission is continuing its $150 million lawsuit against Elon Musk that was brought during the Biden administration. According to a court filing Monday, the tech billionaire and head of the Department of Government Efficiency has agreed to respond to the suit, which accuses him of misleading investors when he bought millions of dollars in Twitter stock in 2022, prior to his acquisition of the company. The SEC brought the case against Musk on Jan. 14 in the waning days of the Biden administration, and a representative of the SEC served Musk with the complaint and a summons earlier this month -- though Musk contests the validity of the service. Under the terms of the agreement, Musk's lawyers will file a response to the complaint by June 6, pending approval from the court. \"The parties respectfully submit that this compromise is reasonable and will conserve judicial resources,\" the filing said. Monday's filing marks the first time a deadline for Musk to respond to the complaint has been raised by either party. Musk's lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment by ABC News. \"They spend their time on s--- like this when there are so many actual crimes that go unpunished,\" Musk said on X in January in response to the SEC's suit. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":1}

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"ByMichael Foster  ByMichael Foster,  Contributor.  Investment asset allocation and rebalance concept. In our Thursday article, we talked about a \u201cquiet shift\u201d in the markets, from growth stocks to value\u2014and we named 2 CEFs yielding 9%+ that are primed to profit from it. Yes, the recent jump in volatility is a big reason for that. So today, we\u2019re going to look at another side of the rotation we\u2019re seeing\u2014a shift from passive investing to active. As we move further into 2025, it\u2019s getting clearer to me that we\u2019re into a stock-picker\u2019s market. Sitting in an index fund just won\u2019t cut it. That said, at my CEF Insider service, we\u2019re still bullish on stocks (and stock-focused closed-end funds, many of which hand us 8%+ yields), and we\u2019ll get into two stock-focused funds, along with another that holds preferred stocks\u2014kind of a stock\/bond hybrid\u2014below. Because there\u2019s no question that success in this market will require active management\u2014moving into, and out of, the right stocks and sectors at the right times. Of course, many mainstream investors aren\u2019t interested in that\u2014it\u2019s too much work. Which is why I\u2019m betting that many of them are likely to give CEFs a closer look as we move further into 2025. As they do, they\u2019ll discover what we\u2019ve known at CEF Insider for years: CEFs let you sit back and collect high yields (and price upside) while \u201cfarming out\u201d picking the actual investments to a professional human manager. That makes now a great time to pick up some well-run CEFs as active management (finally) regains appeal. Doing so lets us buy our CEFs at a discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios), especially in the wake of the recent selloff. Then, as more investors pile in, we get to ride along as those discounts shrink, pulling our CEFs\u2019 market prices higher as they do. Which brings me back to those three CEFs I mentioned off the top\u2014the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG)\u2014a CEF Insider holding\u2014the SRH Total Return Fund (STEW) and the Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred and Income Securities Fund (FFC). All are trading at discounts and boast dividends that are either sky-high (9.4% in the case of ASG) or set to grow (like STEW\u2019s 4%-yielding payout). ASG is a multi-manager fund that invests in large-, mid- and small-cap growth stocks. This means it leverages the knowledge of experts in different sectors (tech, financial, etc.), as well as experts with experience investing in big companies, small companies and everything in between. ASG is interesting now because, in a sense, it gives us two discounts. The first is the fund\u2019s discount to NAV, which is 7.9% as I write this, even though the fund has delivered an 8.4% annualized total return over the last decade, based on its market price, as of this writing. That 7.9% discount is well below its five-year average of 1%, which is our first discount here. The other one is on the fund\u2019s stocks themselves, and we can see the recent dip in those by looking at its NAV performance, including dividends. That\u2019s entirely the result of the last few weeks of volatility: ASG Total Returns Meantime, ASG offers a rich 9.4% dividend yield. Unlike ETFs, which typically provide minimal yield, ASG\u2019s managed-distribution policy (meaning ASG management can raise or lower payouts depending on what\u2019s best for the fund\u2019s long-term returns. Moreover, ASG\u2019s overall yield is actually higher than it looks, since management regularly pays special dividends. ASG Dividend With a discount to NAV and a dip in its portfolio performance, ASG is set up to gain as more investors \u201cfarm out\u201d their stock picking. Buy it now and we could collect that 9.4% \u201cbase\u201d payout in the meantime. Next up is the SRH Total Return Fund (STEW), which sports one of the biggest discounts in CEFs, at 23.1%. That\u2019s wild when you consider that STEW delivered a tidy 12.7% annualized return over the last decade. Moreover, that 23.1% discount is nearly five percentage points wider than STEW\u2019s long-term average of 18.2%. STEW Discount STEW\u2019s top holdings include Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B), which comprises nearly 40% of the portfolio between the two share classes, as well as other well-known large caps, like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and pipeline master limited partnership (MLP) Enterprise Products Partners (EPD). So, why is this fund trading at such a deep discount? Simply put: neglect. STEW doesn\u2019t have the same name recognition as some larger CEFs. But with markets now rewarding active strategies and investors looking to large caps during this volatility, that\u2019s set to change. STEW is also valuable because management can put 40% of their portfolio in stocks like BRK when they\u2019re undervalued, while SEC rules limit passive funds to stick to no more than about 10% of their assets in any one holding. Once investors pick up on STEW\u2019s strong performance and deep discount, the gap should narrow. And with a very well-covered dividend, you\u2019re very likely to see higher payouts over time, building on the 4% yield you\u2019d get on a buy made today. In fact, history strongly suggests that\u2019s exactly what\u2019ll happen here: STEW Dividend Just in the past five years, STEW\u2019s payout has jumped 62%, and as you can see at the right of this chart, its payout growth is accelerating. That bodes well for anyone buying this bargain-priced CEF today. The Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred Securities Income Fund (FFC) holds preferred shares, which trade on an exchange, like stocks, and represent ownership in a company. But their price movements are more like those of bonds. And, like bonds, they\u2019re sensitive to interest rates. More on that in a second. Banks and insurance companies are the main issuers of preferreds, which is why 54% of FFC\u2019s portfolio consists of financial services firms, with preferreds from the likes of Wells Fargo and MetLife. That\u2019s something to keep in mind when you\u2019re considering how FFC fits into your overall portfolio weighting. Beyond that, the fund is a good way to pick up a basket of preferreds and lock in a 6.8% yield while doing so. FFC Dividend Above you can see the rate sensitivity of FFC\u2019s dividend in action, with the payout moving lower as rates rose in 2022 and 2023, then steadying and rising as rates topped out and began to move lower (along with a special dividend late last year). Here\u2019s what makes FFC particularly interesting now: It historically trades at a premium to NAV of 1%, but it\u2019s currently at a 5.8% discount. That\u2019s a big break from its norm, and it\u2019s unlikely to last. Preferred securities tend to do well when rates are stabilizing, and that\u2019s where we are now, with Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell saying he\u2019s content to hold off on further cuts until the effects of Trump administration policies (especially around tariffs) become clearer. Even so, the latest projections from the Federal Open Market Committee do still indicate that two rate cuts are expected in 2025, probably toward the end of the year. When that happens, preferreds will benefit, and funds like FFC are likely to see renewed interest\u2014which I see pushing the fund\u2019s discount back toward a premium. That leaves us with FFC\u2019s 6.8% dividend (with potential for more payout growth) to collect while we wait. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Joe Raedle\/Getty Images\/Hulton Archive                                       hide caption  The last day of March commemorates labor activist and civil rights icon Cesar Chavez, whose fight to better the lives of the nation's farmworkers helped improve the inhumane working conditions of the vital, but often overlooked industry. President Barack Obama proclaimed the day a holiday in 2014, and it is observed in a handful of states, including California, where Chavez first began his mission to challenge the way farmhands were treated. Chavez was born on March 31, 1927, in Yuma, Ariz., to Mexican-born farmers. When he was a child, his family lost their farm during the Great Depression, leading Chavez into what would become his longtime career of migrant field labor. Noticing the brutal conditions of the industry, where families like his own were expected to work grueling hours in the hot sun for mere pennies, forcing them into living conditions that would be considered largely inhumane, Chavez began studying the work of nonviolent activists like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi. After leaving the Navy in 1946, Chavez eventually adopted La Causa \u2014 the cause \u2014 to unionize the largely immigrant workforce and push for fair wages and better conditions. In 1962, Chavez left the comfort of a salaried position at the Community Service Organization and moved his family to Delano, Calif., where he, alongside his wife and their eight young children, launched the National Farm Workers Association. Lacking a paycheck but dedicated to unionizing the farm labor force, in 1965, Chavez traveled across California's Imperial and San Joaquin valleys to recruit new members for the movement that would eventually become the United Farm Workers union. During this recruitment period, Chavez relied on donations to get by. Though he would voluntarily remain poor all his life, Chavez found success in uniting field workers, heading up nonviolent movements like boycotting the table grape market, his famous 340-mile march from Delano to Sacramento, and a 25-day fast in 1968 that left him too weak to even read a speech he had prepared. The speech, read on his behalf, said in part: \"It is my deepest belief that only by giving our lives do we find life. I am convinced that the truest act of courage, the strongest act of manliness, is to sacrifice ourselves for others in a totally non-violent struggle for justice. To be a man is to suffer for others. God help us be men.\" While Chavez faced threats of violence from police and cruelty from farm owners, as well as being spied on for years by the FBI under suspicions of being an extremist, his legacy has been embraced in popular culture. In 1994, the year after Chavez's death, he was posthumously awarded by President Bill Clinton the Medal of Freedom. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  NVDA Stock Nvidia stock has fallen around 5% in the past week and is currently down nearly 12% over the last month. So, what has triggered the recent sell-off in Nvidia shares?   Nvidia is facing mixed developments in China. According to the Financial Times, China's National Development and Reform Commission has introduced new energy-efficiency standards for advanced chips used in data centers. These new regulations could effectively prevent Nvidia\u2019s H20 chip from being used by Chinese firms expanding or building new data centers. The H20 is Nvidia\u2019s leading chip tailored for China, featuring scaled-back capabilities to comply with U.S. export restrictions on advanced semiconductors. Compared to Nvidia\u2019s top-tier Blackwell processors available elsewhere, the H20 is less advanced. Resellers operating in the gray market have reportedly been using entities registered outside of China to acquire Nvidia\u2019s newest chips, including the Blackwell GPUs\u2014which are prohibited from being sold to Chinese customers\u2014via companies based in Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Recently, Singapore charged three individuals in connection with a fraud case involving the suspected resale of Nvidia chips through Malaysia to China. Under pressure from the U.S., Malaysia is now working with both the U.S. and Singapore to monitor the distribution of Nvidia\u2019s high-end chips and to strengthen semiconductor regulations. These concerns are particularly noteworthy, as Singapore has emerged as Nvidia\u2019s second-largest market, contributing approximately $23 billion in revenue for FY\u201925 (ended January 26), accounting for 18% of total sales\u2014an increase from $2.3 billion, or about 8% of revenue, in FY\u201923. In contrast, China officially made up 13% of revenue in FY\u201925. Increased regulatory attention on these transactions could have implications for Nvidia stock. There is increasing skepticism about the sustainability of the current AI spending surge. Evidence suggests that the massive capital allocation by major U.S. tech companies could begin to taper. In January, Chinese startup DeepSeek introduced an AI model that operates at a significantly lower cost than those of most Western competitors. This development could encourage companies to shift away from hardware-heavy strategies and focus on more efficient solutions. Moreover, returns from AI investments have been underwhelming so far, causing concern among investors\u2014particularly if the U.S. economy weakens. With inflation expected to rise again and economic growth potentially slowing under new tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump, market apprehensions are growing. Reports this week noted that Microsoft canceled several data center projects across the U.S. and Europe in the last six months, citing demand not matching supply. Meanwhile, Alibaba\u2019s Chairman Joe Tsai also recently warned of a potential bubble in AI and data center investments. The increase in NVDA stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 125% in 2021, -50% in 2022, 239% in 2023, and 171% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index, less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could NVDA face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months \u2013 or will it see a strong jump? We currently value Nvidia stock at around $101 per share, which is roughly 10% below its current market price of $112. See our analysis of Nvidia valuation: Expensive or Cheap. There are several reasons behind our slightly bearish view on the stock right now. One is the potential decline in the \u201cfear-of-missing-out\u201d driven AI rally seen over the past two years, due to diminishing performance returns from increasingly large models and challenges in accessing high-quality training data. A transition toward more efficient AI models could amplify headwinds for GPU producers like Nvidia. Additionally, Nvidia may encounter increased competition from companies such as AMD and even some of its own customers like Amazon, which are developing and deploying proprietary AI chips. While Nvidia benefits from a strong software ecosystem that complements its AI hardware\u2014helping retain customers\u2014it may still face pressures. At its current premium valuation, the stock might not fully account for these risks.

March is shaping out to be the worst month for the S&P 500 since September 2022, erasing more than ... More $3 trillion in market value. All three major indexes dropped Monday morning, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the bellwether S&P 500 fell more than 1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank more than 2% by midmorning, before storming back in a rocky session that ended with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P in the green and the Nasdaq in the red. On the final day of March and 2025\u2019s first quarter, the losses are staggering: The Dow fell 5% this month and 2% this quarter, the S&P 6% in March and 5% this quarter and the Nasdaq 8% this month and 10% this quarter. March was the S&P\u2019s and Nasdaq\u2019s biggest monthly percentage declines since December 2022 and capped off the indexes\u2019 worst quarters since 2022. The S&P briefly re-entered correction territory Monday, trading more than 10% below its Feb. 19 all-time closing high and hitting its lowest intraday level since early September. Again driving losses Monday morning were comments from Trump on his looming reciprocal tariffs, saying they will target \u201call countries,\u201d which Goldman Sachs predicts will worsen inflation and threaten a recession; Goldman strategists lowered their three-month price target for the S&P to 5,300, forecasting a further 4% loss for the index by the end of June.

Tesla stock is down 15% this month and 38% year-to-date, almost matching Nvidia stock\u2019s 16% March loss and 22% drop this quarter. Shares of other AI-heavy stocks including Amazon, Broadcom and Palantir also fell at least 1% on Monday. More than $3 trillion. That\u2019s about how much market value companies listed on the S&P lost in March, according to FactSet data.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Psycho Patrol R is a \u2018policing and punishment simulator\u2019 set in a world teetering on collapse by  Toussaint Egan In Psycho Patrol R, social media is a lot like cocaine. While doomscrolling isn\u2019t technically illegal in the game\u2019s universe, it is punishable by lethal force when done in excess. The latest from Consumer Softproducts, the independent studio run by Finnish multimedia artist-designer Ville Kallio, Psycho Patrol R is a cyberpunk immersive sim shooter made up of extremes. Extreme violence, extreme aesthetics, extreme gameplay variety and open-world potential. Given all its moving parts, the fact that it coheres as well as it does feels exhilarating once you take the time to attune yourself to its quirks and peculiar rhythms. And while, as of this writing, the early access build of the game is currently unfinished, the moment-to-moment experience is already something to behold. Set in an alternate year 2000 in Pan-Europa, a conglomerate nation teetering on the brink of collapse, Psycho Patrol R is described by Kallio as a \u201cpolicing and punishment simulator.\u201d Players assume the role of a rookie officer of the European Federal Police, assigned to work in the organization\u2019s experimental new law enforcement unit known as Psycho Patrol. Your mission? Discipline, punish, and protect, in that order. Led by an enigmatic bureaucrat obsessed with the fringe theories of Viennese psychiatrist Wilhelm Reich, Psycho Patrol\u2019s purpose is nothing short of \u201cde-Hitlerifying\u201d the EFP from the inside out. In addition to rehabilitating the organization\u2019s image, Psycho Patrol\u2019s official mandate is combating \u201cpsychohazards,\u201d malignant thought viruses caused by unhealthy hyperfixations elicited through social media usage or illicit psychoactive substances that, if left unchecked, can manifest into violent criminal behavior.  If that sounds bizarre, it is. I haven\u2019t even mentioned Bion, the friendly \u201cneuro-homunculus\u201d spawned by your latent psychosexual energy who sounds like Navi from Ocarina of Time; the interdepartmental drama between Psycho Patrol and the militant Anti-Cocaine Task Force, which still punishes cocaine usage in spite of its legality; or even the fact that you pilot a giant bipedal mech with chicken legs called a \u201cV-Stalker\u201d that\u2019s armed with interchangeable, high-caliber weapons. Oh, and don\u2019t forget the hexadecimal-based hacking system, or the in-game stock market that\u2019s reactive to the choices and outcomes of your missions, or the roving militias of involuntary celibates and random drive-by aggressors who will shoot you on sight. It\u2019s a mad, mad world, and you are but a tiny cog in the blood-slicked machinery of the state. As if Psycho Patrol R couldn\u2019t be any more explicit about its themes, the exterior of the EFP headquarters resembles two of the most infamous real-life examples of Italian fascist architecture: the Palace of Italian Civilization and the Palazzo Braschi, a neoclassical palace that was renovated into the headquarters of Mussolini\u2019s Italian Fascist Party in 1934. At nearly every juncture of my initial playthrough, I found myself asking two questions: Can the master\u2019s tools be used to dismantle the master\u2019s house (the answer: lol no), and just what kind of cop am I? The latter is yet to be determined, but given that the motto of the EFP is \u201cCirculation of blood is circulation of power,\u201d I\u2019m sure you can venture a guess as to where the player\u2019s actions are meant to align on the political spectrum. Psycho Patrol R doesn\u2019t waste any time ingratiating you to its dizzying array of systems and subsystems. After choosing one of six character archetypes, each with their own unique stats, you\u2019re thrust into the bureaucratic maw of the EFP immediately as you spawn in your office with gun in hand. From there, you\u2019ll spend most of your initial moments floundering through EFP headquarters, accidentally kicking through doors instead of opening them, yapping with your co-workers, and eventually making your way over to your boss\u2019s office in order to receive your first mission as a member of Psycho Patrol. To be fair, the game does include a handy \u201cquick start\u201d guide in your menu screen with a list of beginner tips and default control settings, which is a lot more than can be said of Kallio\u2019s previous game, Cruelty Squad. When Cruelty Squad launched back in 2021, it hit with all the subtlety of a Molotov lobbed at the broadside of a police cruiser. Casting players in the role of an augmented assassin forced to carry out \u201ccorporate liquidations\u201d at the behest of demonic CEOs, Cruelty Squad was unambiguously anticapitalistic in its conceit, satirizing the myopic death drive of corporate greed and the dehumanizing infrastructure of the gig economy. Combined with an abrasive, maximalist art style of bright, clashing textures and the leering, dead-eyed NPCs inspired by low-poly 3D games from the \u201990s, you had an experience that was honest to God unlike anything else released at that time. It was horrible; it was beautiful. People hated it and yet couldn\u2019t get enough of it, myself included. More than three years in the making, Psycho Patrol R builds on the success of its predecessor without feeling beholden to it. While they might appear similar at a glance, it doesn\u2019t take long for this new game to distinguish itself from Cruelty Squad. For instance, you\u2019re not playing an assassin in this game; you\u2019re playing a mid-level bureaucrat cop with a bipedal mech and an unofficial mandate to do what thou wilt within the whole of your authority. Put simply: You can\u2019t just shoot everyone on sight; you actually have to talk to people to round up information and make informed decisions as to when and where exactly you can shoot everyone on sight. Unlike Cruelty Squad, Psycho Patrol R leans wholesale into the open-ended design philosophy of immersive sim shooters, giving you multiple options aside from violence in achieving your objectives. Furthermore, the thematic priorities of Psycho Patrol R, while complementary to that game\u2019s critique of capitalism, are not exactly the same. The primary concern of Kallio\u2019s second game is not so much with capitalism as it is with the twilight of globalism, the threat of total information collapse, the end of all consensus reality, and the naked hypocrisy of law enforcement attempting to launder its reputation while practicing the same tactics of violence to uphold order.  If you liked Cruelty Squad, or enjoy inventive immersive sims in general, you\u2019ll likely enjoy and perhaps even grow to love Psycho Patrol R with time. However, bear in mind that even if you love Cruelty Squad, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you\u2019ll immediately be proficient at this game. You will die a lot. You will fail a lot. But what lies on the other side of all that failure and confusion is an unabashedly idiosyncratic game that, while unfinished, is already shaping up to be an experience that\u2019s more than the sum of its peculiar parts.  Psycho Patrol R was released March 24 in early access on Windows PC. The game was reviewed on PC using a copy purchased by the author. Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Elon Musk acknowledged\u00a0that his role overseeing President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to slash federal spending is costing him \u2014 and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 \u201ca lot.\u201d Backlash over Musk\u2019s job leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was swift and has grown in recent weeks as the group continues to direct the Trump administration\u2019s approach to downsizing the government. Musk claimed last week that DOGE cuts an average of $4 billion in federal spending each day.  His Tesla has become an easy target for protesters angered by his support of Trump and his work in the federal government. Non-violent, anti-Tesla protests have been held across the U.S. and other countries, while vandalism against the company\u2019s customers and facilities has ramped up.  Forty-seven percent of voters surveyed by NBC News (CMCSA) earlier this month had a negative view of DOGE, while 51% had a negative view of Musk himself. The idea of DOGE, however, was more popular, with 46% calling it a good idea and 40% saying it was bad. \u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to do is put massive pressure on me, and Tesla I guess, to you know, I don\u2019t know, stop doing this,\u201d Musk said on Sunday. \u201cMy Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone, went roughly in half. I mean it\u2019s a big deal.\u201d Telsa shares hit a record price of $479.86 at its post-election fueled peak on Dec. 17, but most of those gains have since been wiped out. The stock has fallen by more than 30% year-to-date, sending Musk\u2019s net worth down $102 billion to $330 billion. He still has a more than $100 billion lead over the next richest person in the world, Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos.  Tesla stock dropped by more than 5% to $248 per share in pre-market trading on Monday as investors await weaker first-quarter sales than previously expected. Deliveries are expected to have taken a hit from the \u201cTesla Takedown\u201d protests that have continued to put pressure on Tesla, as well as weaker sales in Europe and China.  \u201cLong term I think Tesla stock\u2019s going to do fine, so maybe it\u2019s a buying opportunity,\u201d Musk said from a political event in Wisconsin, where he took the stage wearing a cheesehead hat.  The Tesla CEO was in Wisconsin on Sunday to support Brad Schimel, who has been endorsed by Republicans in the state\u2019s Supreme Court election scheduled for Tuesday. Musk and his allies have spent more than $20 million campaigning across the state. On Sunday, Musk handed out $1 million checks to two local voters who had expressed support for Schimel and signed a petition supporting his candidacy. A third individual had earlier received a $1 million check.  Those people were also named as spokespeople for his America PAC, a tactic that allows the group to side-step\u00a0accusations of running an illegal lottery. A similar strategy was employed by Musk to hand out $1 million checks to more than a dozen people during the 2024 presidential election.  \u201cEasiest money you ever made!\u201d Musk said on Monday, advocating for people  to get Wisconsin residents to sign America PAC\u2019s petition and post a photo supporting Schimel. \u201cEvery time you do that you get $20 and they get $20. The goal is to build awareness about the election tomorrow, so this offer applies to today and tomorrow.\u201d Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"A version of this article originally appeared in Quartz\u2019s members-only Weekend Brief newsletter. Quartz members get access to exclusive newsletters and more. Sign up here. In late 2022, Satya Nadella made what might be the defining bet of his career: pouring billions into OpenAI while restructuring Microsoft around artificial intelligence. At first, the move looked like strategic genius. While Google, Apple, and Meta scrambled to catch up in the AI race, Microsoft appeared to have secured the winning horse, giving it a commanding early lead. Wall Street rewarded this vision, adding over a trillion dollars to Microsoft\u2019s market cap. By early 2025, however, that vision has collided with a harsher reality. Microsoft now faces a perfect storm of challenges in its AI gambit: massive data center pullbacks, lagging stock performance relative to tech peers, growing tensions with OpenAI, and a market that may be showing some slow down in its interest in all things AI. For a company that has masterfully navigated every technological revolution of the past five decades, these warning signs suggest its biggest bet yet may be faltering. The stock market\u2019s verdict has been particularly harsh. Microsoft shares narrowly avoided their first eight-week losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis only through a last-minute rally on March 21, according to CNBC. Since reaching a closing high of $467.56 in July 2024, Microsoft is down about 16%. Even more telling, Microsoft is down 7% for the year while other AI-focused tech giants have surged, making it the only Magnificent 7 tech stock without a gain over the past year. Behind the scenes, Microsoft has been quietly backing away from its ambitious AI infrastructure plans. The company has canceled planned data centers that would have powered the next generation of AI systems. According to TD Cowen, Microsoft has abandoned facilities that would have boosted its computing power by roughly 14% \u2013 equivalent to the entire computing capacity of a major global tech hub like Tokyo. Microsoft has also decided to skip out on a $12 billion option for more data center capacity from cloud computing company Coreweave, according to Semafor. These retreats seem especially telling for a company that repeatedly claimed AI demand was \u201cexceeding supply.\u201d Nadella himself hinted at the reality in a recent podcast, admitting \u201cthere will be overbuild\u201d in data centers related to AI. Adding to Microsoft\u2019s challenges is a deteriorating relationship with OpenAI. According to The Information, Microsoft\u2019s AI chief Mustafa Suleyman has a dual mandate that reveals the company\u2019s growing uncertainty: maintain the OpenAI partnership while simultaneously putting Microsoft \u201con a path to self-sufficiency in AI so it won\u2019t have to rely indefinitely on OpenAI\u2019s technology.\u201d Microsoft is already developing its own family of AI models (internally called MAI) and testing models from competitors including Anthropic, xAI, DeepSeek and Meta as potential OpenAI replacements for Copilot. It has its work cutout for it with Copilot, which has struggled to gain meaningful traction in the market. A Gartner survey found few companies moving Copilot initiatives beyond initial testing, with \u201ctangible business impact proving elusive\u201d and implementation requiring \u201cmore effort than anticipated.\u201d One government IT executive described Copilot as \u201cso far behind that it is frustrating to use.\u201d But Microsoft may not be alone in facing these challenges. There are growing signs that all AI tools might be struggling to find more users. According to the Fall 2024 Slack Workforce Index, AI adoption growth rates among U.S. workers have slowed to a mere percentage point gain over the last three months, compared to nearly double-digit gains in the same period a year earlier. A paper by Gartner said that CIOs were increasingly nervous about AI spending, with one Gartner analyst telling the UK tech publication The Register that 2025 could be the \u201cyear of the slide.\u201d As Microsoft celebrates its 50th anniversary, the company finds itself at a crossroads. Its AI strategy \u2014 raising prices while forcing AI integration into products, developing competing models while maintaining its OpenAI partnership, and scaling back infrastructure while claiming unprecedented demand \u2014 suggests a company trying to hedge its bets rather than confidently doubling down on the next technological revolution.  For a tech giant that has thrived by repeatedly reinventing itself, Microsoft\u2019s contradictory approach to AI may be the clearest signal yet that even industry leaders aren\u2019t sure if the AI revolution will live up to its trillion-dollar hype.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Business Insider Edition  Brian Niccol is making some big changes at Starbucks. It's hardly his first time attempting a turnaround at a fast-food chain.          Niccol has two decades of experience in the restaurant industry, from Pizza Hut to Chipotle. He's honed a specialty in that time as someone who can take a struggling chain and make it successful.               Here's how Niccol became one of the most notable leaders in the restaurant industry.               After graduating from Miami University in Ohio in 1996, Niccol took a job at consumer products manufacturer Procter & Gamble.               One of his early successes was a marketing campaign for Scope mouthwash that allowed customers to send animated kisses to each other through email platform Hotmail, Niccol told the Los Angeles Times in 2015.               While mouthwash itself wasn't new or innovative, Niccol said the campaign used a then-new technology to keep the brand relevant. \"What I've always seen is the brands that have a youthful mindset, a youthful vigor, they have a great value proposition,\" he told the Times.               While working at Procter & Gamble, Niccol earned an MBA from the University of Chicago.               Niccol joined Yum! Brands, the company that owns KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell, in 2005. His first roles were at Pizza Hut. In 2011, he became CEO at Taco Bell.               Under Niccol, Taco Bell pushed back on perceptions of its food quality. In 2011, a lawsuit alleged that Taco Bell's beef used too many fillers. The lawsuit was dismissed, but the impact weighed down Taco Bell's results in the quarters afterward, executives said at the time.               Niccol oversaw a various changes, from the chain's new \"Live Ms\" slogan to a new breakfast menu. Taco Bell also launched the Doritos Locos Taco, which uses a shell coated in the chip's flavored coating, and started serving boozy Baja Blasts and other alcohol at Taco Bell Cantina locations.               The changes rejuvenated sales. By the time Niccol moved on to this next job in 2018, one analyst called his tenure as CEO a \"brand revitalization\" for Taco Bell.               In late 2017, Niccol learned that Chipotle founder and CEO Steve Ells planned to step down as soon as the Mexican grill chain could find his replacement.               \"When I saw the news, I thought, 'That's interesting,'\" Niccol told the Harvard Business Review in 2021. In early 2018, he became Chipotle's new CEO and a director.               At the time, the Mexican grill chain was struggling. A few years earlier, Chipotle faced a months-long E. coli outbreak at its restaurants that ultimately sickened over 1,000 people. Like the lawsuit over Taco Bell's meat, the fallout was hurting the brand's sales for longer than executives had expected.               Chipotle made some big changes once Niccol became CEO. He moved the company's headquarters to Orange County, California, from Colorado. Chipotle also beefed up food safety procedures and training for employees, steps Niccol touted in early 2020 as COVID-19 spread around the world and customers became more conscious of their health.               And in a few years, Chipotle went from having almost no digital presence to adding dedicated drive-thru lanes, called \"Chipotlanes,\" for picking up online orders at thousands of stores.               The changes worked. Chipotle's stock was trading around $6 a share when Niccol took over as CEO in March 2018. By the time he left for Starbucks last year, shares of Chipotle stood around $56 each.               Niccol's work at Chipotle helped solidify his status as an executive who could improve restaurants' financial performance.               \"They might've been struggling at the time, but boy, at the core, I just believed there was a reason why they should succeed,\" Niccol said at the time.               Even Niccol's current Starbucks biography mentions his time at Chipotle.               \"He more than doubled the business by establishing Chipotle as a culinary leader, pioneering digital innovation, introducing exciting new menu offerings, and expanding internationally,\" the biography reads.               Niccol joined the coffee chain as CEO in September.               Even before he started, industry analysts said that Niccol's accomplishments at Chipotle and Yum! were strong credentials to tackle Starbucks' challenges, including slumping quarterly sales and operational challenges such as long wait times.               Still, Starbucks is larger and more complex than Chipotle, some analysts pointed out. Chipotle had about 3,700 locations in its mostly US-based store network at the end of 2024. Starbucks, meanwhile, had about 40,000 stores as of September, according to its latest annual filing with the SEC. Just over half of those were outside North America.               While he's just six months into the job, Niccol has already overseen a lot of changes at Starbucks.               The coffee chain laid off about 1,100 corporate employees last month, a move that Niccol said would allow Starbucks to \"operate more efficiently, increase accountability, reduce complexity and drive better integration.\"               Many Starbucks customers have also noticed changes at their local stores, from the return of self-service bars for milk and sugar to the requirement that patrons make a purchase to hang out there.               Changes to Starbucks' mobile ordering system, including timed pick-up slots, could also be coming, Niccol has said.               The goal is to win customers back and restore Starbucks' traditional role as a \"third place\" to spend time besides work and home, Niccol has said.               \"Our stores will be inviting places to linger, with comfortable seating, thoughtful design, and a clear distinction between 'to-go' and 'for-here' service,\" he wrote in his first public message as CEO in September.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Business Insider Edition  Tesla sales workers have been waiting for guidance from corporate leaders about the vandalism and demonstrations outside showrooms. On the eve of more than 200 planned protests, employees received a video featuring a senior executive encouraging them to \"stay vigilant\" amid a \"dynamic and fast-paced environment.\"          The video, a copy of which was seen by Business Insider, was described as an end-of-quarter reflection. It featured smiling workers, promotional footage of the Optimus robot and Tesla's robotaxi, and a dog in the front seat of a vehicle.               In the video, Troy Jones, a vice president of North American sales and service, described Tesla's salespeople as the \"heart of the company.\" He encouraged workers to look out for each other and \"stay vigilant.\"               \"If you notice something that doesn't seem right, don't hesitate to speak up,\" Jones said. \"Your safety is the top priority. We are used to being in the spotlight, and in this dynamic and fast-paced environment, thank you for remaining passionate about our customers and working together as a team.\"               \"Your energy, efforts, and determination sets the pace for the rest of the company,\" Jones said. \"We have an incredible opportunity ahead of us. Every conversation, every relationship is our opportunity to share our industry-leading product with the world.\"               \"This is just the beginning, and I'm so excited about the future,\" he said.               Earlier this month, the company sent out a separate end-of-quarter video featuring Jones. It did not mention the protests.               Seven Tesla employees told BI the company recently provided sales staff \u2014 the company's most public-facing workers \u2014 with general safety guidelines that did not directly address the protests.               One worker called Jones' most recent video \"disappointing.\"               \"It felt a little trivial,\" the worker said. \"Like, that's it? Really?\"               A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Jones did not immediately respond to a request for comment.               The video was shared with American sales staff on Friday evening, less than 24 hours before a global day of action organized by the activist group Tesla Takedown was set to take place. Over 200 protests were planned across the US.               Since early February, Tesla showrooms have faced a rash of nonviolent demonstrations and attacks involving Molotov cocktails, arson, and gunshots. The FBI recently launched a joint task force in response to the vandalism, and Attorney General Pam Bondi has labeled the incidents \"domestic terrorism.\"               Tesla CEO Elon Musk has addressed the public vitriol in press appearances and during a surprise all-hands meeting on March 20, comparing the backlash to \"Armageddon\" and encouraging employees to \"hang on to your stock.\" Aside from that, the carmaker has not sent out internal, companywide guidance that directly addressed the incidents, employees told Business Insider.               In March, the company sent memos about dealing with law enforcement and encouraged staff to review safety guidelines and contact Tesla security for issues involving vandalism or trespassing.               On March 20, Tesla told sales workers it would begin activating Sentry Mode \u2014 which allows a vehicle's sensors and cameras to record activity, even when it's not in use \u2014 on vehicles at the sales centers. Workers were notified of the change several hours after Musk posted about the update on X.               Some sales workers have been relying on guidance at the store level. They told BI that store managers have instructed them to avoid engaging with protesters and to only take action if the protesters do something illegal.               \"The general guidance seems to be to exit those conversations as quickly as possible because it won't move business forward,\" one salesperson said.               Five workers said they'd dealt with protesters at their facility, and six said they'd had to deal with an uptick in prank calls and disgruntled customers.               Four said they felt they'd been kept mostly in the dark. One said they've felt uncertain about how to interact with both customers and protesters at their sales center, which has seen multiple protests in recent weeks.               The carmaker also has not referenced the backlash in regular internal communication with its sales teams.               Newsletters sent to sales workers twice a week are often used to establish uniform practices across the sales centers and provide policy updates. Since the protests began, none have directly acknowledged the incidents, workers said. The newsletters have focused on reminders around federal tax credits and talking points for Tesla's Cybertruck recall and new Model Y.               The carmaker also holds twice-monthly sales calls with several hundred workers, including store managers and director-level employees. One worker told BI there'd been no mention of the protests in the sales calls over the past two months. The calls were focused on building relationships with customers and preparing for the end of the quarter, the worker said.               Tesla also sends sales workers talking points on everything from how to address the recent Cybertruck recall to questions about the robotaxi. The company has not sent talking points for how to address customers who have questions about Musk or the protests, seven workers said.       Do you work for Tesla or have a tip?

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"One told ABC \"there is no constitutional basis\" for what Trump is proposing. President Donald Trump has often mused, even joked, about seeking a third term, but over the weekend he made his strongest and most serious comments yet on a move that constitutional scholars ABC News spoke with call virtually impossible. \"I'm not joking,\" he told NBC News \"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker in a phone interview on Sunday, before adding it was \"far too early to think about it.\" \"There are methods which you could do it,\" Trump said, including a scenario in which Vice President JD Vance ran at the top of the 2028 ticket with Trump as his running mate, only for Trump to assume the Oval Office after the election. Legal and election experts told ABC News any attempt to win another four years as president would be an unprecedented breach of the Constitution. \"Trump may not want to rule out a third term but the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution does,\" said David Schultz, a professor at Hamline University and an expert in constitutional law. The amendment states, in part: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice.\" It was ratified in 1951, years after President Franklin D. Roosevelt broke with the two-term tradition set by George Washington and secured a third term as World War II was breaking out. \"It would be completely unprecedented for a president to openly defy the dictates of the 22nd Amendment and, even more so, to attempt to run or serve again as president,\" said Michael Gerhardt, a constitutional expert at the University of North Carolina. \"The threats and insinuations no doubt thrill his base, but there is no constitutional basis for the current president to try to serve as president after two elected terms,\" Gerhardt said. The only way legal way for Trump to be able to run for a third term, experts said, would be to amend the Constitution -- an incredibly unlikely outcome as it would take two-thirds of both the House and Senate, or two-thirds of the states agreeing to call a constitutional convention. Then, any change would require three-fourths of the states to sign on for ratification. \"This statement by Trump was brilliant in terms of capturing and diverting attention,\" said Schultz. \"His supporters love it and his detractors will rage over it. In the process, no one will talk about the price of eggs, tariffs and a shaky stock market.\" As for Trump's claim that one of the \"methods\" could be to run as Vance's vice president and then be passed the baton, experts point to the 12th Amendment from 1804 as a barrier. \"The 12th Amendment states that anyone who is ineligible to be president is also deemed to be illegible to serve as vice president,\" said Barry Burden, the director of the Elections Research Center at University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"This means that Trump could not serve as vice president, which is the post he would need for the Vance scheme to be executed.\" Steve Bannon, a fierce Trump ally, has also floated what he's called alternatives to allow Trump to run in 2028. Bannon, in remarks at the New York Young Republican Club gala in December, has argued that he could run again as Trump's two terms in office were not consecutive. \"Since it doesn't actually say consecutive, I don't know, maybe we do it again in '28? Are you guys down for that? Trump '28?\" Bannon said. Schultz said that argument doesn't have a sound legal basis. \"The overall limit of serving as president for ten years is both textual proof on the bar to run for a third term and an indication of the intent of the congressional drafters that they did not want anyone serving for more than two terms,\" Schultz said. Section 1 of the 22nd Amendment states: \"no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.\" Schultz added that measure \"was put into place to allow for a situation where a president dies more than halfway into a term and the vice president succeeds that person. The Constitution thereby allows for the vice president to serve out the remaining term and then serve two more terms, for a total of ten years.\" Trump has already tested the bounds of the Constitution governing presidential power several times in the first months of his second term. Several Democrats viewed his comments on Sunday as another escalation against the rule of law. Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin wrote on X: \"This is what dictators do.\" In the past, Republicans have largely played off Trump's musings about a third term as a joke intended to rile his opposition. But just days after his inauguration, Republican hardliner Rep. Andy Ogles introduced a resolution calling for the extension of presidential term limits to allow Trump to seek another four years in the White House. \"A crisis could arise if Trump runs for president or vice president in 2028,\" Burden said. \"The Constitution prohibits serving in office but not running for office. If Republicans nominated him, they would be betting that they can violate the Constitution and somehow allow him to serve if he wins.\" If Trump attempted to run, it would be up to election officials and then ultimately the courts to decide. In the 2024 campaign, several states challenged Trump's eligibility to seek the Republican presidential nomination under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment due to his actions around the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The legal battle went to the Supreme Court, which ruled in Trump's favor. \"If an ineligible person such as Trump is permitted to run knowing that he is not eligible to serve, it is a dangerous collision course in which the U.S. Constitution and the rule of law would be seriously tested,\" Burden said. James Sample, a constitutional law expert at Hofstra University, said Trump would lose in court should he attempt to run again. \"Most of the Constitution is written in broad, textured, difficult to define terms. What is a speedy trial? What is cruel and unusual punishment? What is equal protection? How much process is due process? The 22nd Amendment, however, is black and white,\" Sample said. \"But if you can succeed in turning questions that are that clear-cut into debates, then the overall goal of undermining the Constitution and undermining the rule of law and maximizing executive power is served even if you lose the particular battle,\" he continued. \"This particular battle is not a winnable battle. He is not going to serve a third term, but merely by framing this as a debate, he will succeed in further eroding respect for the Constitution.\" 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"President Donald Trump has sounded more hawkish on trade in recent days after previously downplaying his plans for new tariffs set to be announced this week, according to a new report. It comes as Goldman Sachs (GS) economists have increased their forecasted odds of a recession over the next 12 months, from 20% up to 35%. Trump has pushed his team to be more aggressive on tariffs, encouraging advisers to apply a higher rate of duties on a broader set of countries, The Wall Street Journal (NWSA) reports. Advisers have considered instituting tariffs of up to 20% on almost all U.S. trading partners. Trump has pushed to levy import taxes on goods from all countries with which the U.S. has a trade deficit, and the possibility of so-called \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs remains on the table, The Journal reports.  It remains unclear whether industry-specific duties will be unveiled with the new tariffs expected to be announced Wednesday. Goldman\u2019s higher recession forecast \u201creflects our lower growth baseline, the sharp recent deterioration in household and business confidence, and statements from White House officials indicating greater willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness in pursuit of their policies,\u201d economists Ronnie Walker, Alec Phillips, and David Mericle wrote in a note to clients. The economists project the average rate of U.S. tariffs will rise 15 percentage points this year, their previous \u201crisk case\u201d scenario. That may be ultimately whittled down by exclusions to 9 percentage points. They boosted their year-end 2025 core PCE inflation forecast to an annualized 3.5% from 3% \u2014 and projected lower GDP growth and higher unemployment than before. Trump dismissed concerns about higher car prices over the weekend, telling NBC News (CMCSA) that he didn\u2019t care it he price of foreign autos went up because it would prompt Americans to buy domestically made cars. U.S. automakers have warned that tariffs would increase the costs of their products, too. The stock market had a relatively benign reaction to last week\u2019s auto tariffs announcement, which surprised Chris Grisanti, chief market strategist at MAI Capital Management, given that the duties were more hawkish than he\u2019d anticipated. He now expects new duties this Wednesday to also be hawkish, possibly followed by another muted reaction from investors. \u201cNo one has any experience of moving from a free trade world to a protectionist world,\u201d  Grisanti said last week, \u201cand we\u2019re sort of making it up as we go along.\u201d Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"     Though many states have some sort of tax benefit for renters, not everyone renting a home or apartment qualifies.    Homeowners can take advantage of some nice perks this tax season. By itemizing deductions for real estate taxes and mortgage interest, property owners are usually eligible for IRS tax breaks that others can't claim.\u00a0 What about renters? Don't expect much tax relief if you're handing over a chunk of cash to your landlord each month.\u00a0 Though most renters aren't eligible for a tax break, some rental credits do exist depending on where you live, your income, your age and a few other factors. If you qualify for a renter's credit, it may not be an overwhelming amount of savings, but every dollar counts in today's expensive market. Here's what to know if you're renting your home. On a federal level, the IRS doesn't offer a universal tax incentive for all renters.\u00a0 The foreign housing deduction is the closest thing to a federal deduction available for renters. So, if you're reading this and aren't living in the US, that's good news.\u00a0 \"Self-employed US taxpayers living abroad who qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion may qualify to deduct a portion of their housing expenses, including rent, incurred while living in a foreign country,\" said Logan Allec, CPA and owner of Choice Tax Relief.\u00a0 But that doesn't apply to many people. According to the Association of Americans Resident Overseas, around 5.5 million Americans live abroad. If you run a business and use part of your rental unit as a place for business, you can see if you qualify for the home office deduction.\u00a0 \"If a renter has a space in their home that they regularly and exclusively use for their business, they can deduct a portion of their annual rent expense via the home office deduction,\" Allec said. \"Exclusively\" is the critical part there, though. You can't call your kitchen a home office just because you set up your laptop at the counter in the morning. Most of the time, W-2 remote workers won't qualify for the deduction.\u00a0 While there may not be much you can do on your federal taxes to offset your rental payments, your state tax return may differ. According to Intuit, state tax benefits are available in nearly half the country.\u00a0 Here's a rundown of where renting comes with some potential tax benefits: Even if your state offers the benefit, not all renters qualify for a renter's deduction or credit. The specific qualifications are often based on income or age, and they vary depending on the state, according to Allec.\u00a0 In some places, your income needs to be extremely low to qualify. In New York, for example, you cannot make more than $18,000. Other state programs are geared toward senior citizens. In Montana, for instance, renters need to be at least 62 years old to qualify. Some states have more lenient requirements. In Indiana, every renter can deduct up to $3,000 (or the actual amount of rent paid in the year, whichever is less), regardless of age or annual earnings. Some states offer generous tax credits to renters, such as Pennsylvania and Minnesota, while others are notably low.\u00a0 California, one of the most expensive states in the country, offers a renter's credit of just $60 for individuals and up to $120 for couples filing jointly. That's not worth much if you're renting a place in San Francisco, where the average monthly tab is more than $3,300, according to RentCafe. Depending on where you live, taking advantage of your state's tax credit, deduction or rebate for renting will be different.\u00a0 For example, in California, you'll claim the credit when filing your state return. In other states, however, you may need to submit an application with the Department of Revenue. Be mindful that the application deadlines may not follow federal tax deadlines. In Connecticut, for example, renters apply for the credit between April 1 and Sept. 30.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"ByGiacomo Tognini  ByGiacomo Tognini,  Forbes Staff.  Chris Ruddy, Newsmax's founder and CEO. Conservative news outlet Newsmax went public on Monday morning on the New York Stock Exchange. By the end of the day, its shares were trading 735% higher than its $10 offering price, and the company was valued at $10.7 billion. The stock surge, which caused trading to be halted at least 10 times, has also made its 60-year-old founder and CEO, Chris Ruddy, a billionaire. \u201cToday marks a historic milestone for Newsmax as we transition to a publicly traded company,\u201d Ruddy said in a statement announcing the listing. \u201cThis incredibly successful offering, combined with our previous preferred offering, provides us with the capital and financial freedom to accelerate our growth initiatives, expand our programming and further enhance our digital presence.\u201d According to Newsmax\u2019s offering document, Ruddy owns 31% of the company, worth an estimated $3.3 billion at the closing price of $83.51. He owns all of the Boca Raton, Florida-based firm\u2019s Class A shares, which grant 10 voting rights per share compared to one vote per share for holders of Class B shares, which were offered to the public. Representatives for Newsmax did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Newsmax raised $75 million in the IPO, adding to the $225 million it raised in a private placement in February at $5,000 per share. Ruddy isn\u2019t the only one who won big in the listing: stock brokerage billionaire Thomas Peterffy owns an 18% stake in Newsmax worth an estimated $1.9 billion. It\u2019s unclear when Peterffy invested in the company, and a spokesperson for him declined to comment. Other major investors include Sheikh Sultan bin Jassim Al-Thani, a member of the Qatari royal family, with a 15% stake worth an estimated $1.6 billion, and Ukrainian businessman Vadim Shulman with a 4% stake worth an estimated $361 million. Al-Thani reportedly invested $50 million in Newsmax between 2019 and 2020, according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. A representative for Al-Thani did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Despite its fast-paced growth, with revenues more than tripling between 2019 and 2022, the last couple of years haven\u2019t been a resounding success for Newsmax. The company recorded a $72 million net loss on $171 million revenues in 2024, compared to a $42 million net loss on $135 million revenues in 2023. Between 2022 and 2023, the firm\u2019s losses more than doubled despite revenues staying roughly flat. Newsmax also took a hit in September when it agreed to pay a $40 million settlement to voting machine maker Smartmatic, after Smartmatic had sued the company in 2021 alleging Newsmax spread false claims about it in relation to the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Newsmax has paid out $20 million of that settlement so far, according to its IPO disclosure, and the remaining balance will be paid by March 31 and June 30 this year. The network is still fighting another lawsuit from voting machine firm Dominion Voting Systems, which sued the company for $1.6 billion in damages in August 2021, alleging that Newsmax defamed Dominion in its coverage of the 2020 election. That case is still ongoing, with Newsmax stating in its IPO disclosure that it is \u201cvigorously defending\u201d the suit. Aside from the legal troubles, Newsmax claims its total viewership increased by 22% last year compared to 2023. Besides its cable news channel, it also has an online news site, a news app, a paid subscription service named Newsmax Plus and print publications including Newsmax Magazine and Newsmax Health & Money. Before starting Newsmax, Ruddy grew up in suburban Long Island and got a bachelor's degree in history from St. John's University in New York and a master's in public policy from the London School of Economics. He then worked in journalism at the New York Post and as a national correspondent for the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, where he first met Richard Mellon Scaife (d. 2014), a billionaire heir to the Mellon banking fortune who owned the paper. Ruddy founded Newsmax as a digital news site in 1998 with a $25,000 investment from Scaife, and the pair then raised $15 million from 200 private investors. By 2009, they had bought out those investors, and Ruddy owned 60% of the firm at the time with Scaife holding 40% as a silent partner. Newsmax launched a cable channel in 2014, and it\u2019s now grown to become the fourth-largest news channel in the U.S. with 30 million regular viewers in the last three months of 2024, according to data from Nielsen cited in Newsmax\u2019s public filings. \u201cFox News had more than half of the cable news market,\u201d Ruddy said on CNBC's Squawk Box on Monday, recalling when he decided to launch the cable news network in 2014. \u201cI thought to myself, \u2018Newsmax has a great digital brand in the center-right market, and they have no competition.\u2019 I think there was a demand for more competition against Fox.\" Newsmax still has a long way to go to beat Fox: It pulled in 524,000 viewers in February compared to Fox\u2019s 5.1 million, according to Nielsen cable news ratings. But Ruddy is confident that the firm is on an upward trajectory and has ambitious plans to expand beyond the news business. \u201cWe see ourselves as a growth stock,\u201d he told CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box. \u201cWe have the cable channel, we're still growing that. We have Newsmax 2, our streaming channel. It\u2019s reaching about 15 million people regularly. We have the [Newsmax] Plus service, which we see as a competitor to Netflix for family-friendly news and entertainment.\u201d Besides owning the largest stake in the company, Ruddy can also thank Newsmax for a few other perks: The firm pays his car lease payments and auto insurance, according to its disclosure filing, and also reimbursed the costs for his apartment in New York until last August, when the firm leased its own corporate apartment in the city for Ruddy's use when he works out of Newsmax's New York office. Ruddy owns a home worth an estimated $620,000 in West Palm Beach, Florida, which he purchased for $215,000 in 2002. Newsmax is the latest conservative-focused company to ride a wave of retail investor enthusiasm to an eye-popping valuation. Chris Pavlovski, the founder of right-wing video platform Rumble, became a billionaire in December as the firm's shares soared by more than 100% after it announced a $775 million investment from crypto giant Tether. (Forbes estimates he is no longer a billionaire, with Rumble\u2019s shares falling by 43% since the beginning of the year.) No one has benefited more from that boom than President Donald Trump. Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., the parent company of his social media venture Truth Social, is now valued at $4.3 billion (market capitalization) despite recording a $401 million net loss on just $3.6 million in revenues in 2024. Still, Trump's stake in the firm is worth $2.6 billion, making up more than half of his estimated $5.1 billion fortune. Ruddy entered the media business long before Trump entered politics. In 2009, he told Forbes that Newsmax viewed the world \u201cthrough the eyes of Ronald Reagan.\u201d But he has since come around to America\u2019s 47th president. On March 25, he posted a photo of Trump on X calling him from the Oval Office. \u201cI shared with Potus my new saying,\u201d he wrote. \u201c\u2018A rising Trump lifts all boats!\u2019\u201d","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Katie Stockton, Founder of Fairlead Strategies, spoke with NYSE (ICE) TV for a special video interview. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. KRISTEN SCHOLER: I want to welcome our next guest. She is quite the lead when it comes to this particular industry and this year marks three years since her company Fairlead Strategies and its ETF was launched right here at the Exchange. So joining me now to discuss the anniversary as well as what to expect in this market is Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner at Fairlead Strategies. Katie, welcome. KATIE STOCKTON: Thank you. It\u2019s good to be here. SCHOLER: Yes. Always great to have you at the stock exchange. Congratulations. STOCKTON: Thank you. We\u2019re excited. It\u2019s a nice milestone to reach. SCHOLER: For sure. It\u2019s an incredible milestone. Three years in, where does TACK stand? STOCKTON: So TACK has really proven to be a very good conservative way to invest in the market via the sectors and to do so with nice limited drawdown, sort of a lower beta, lower correlation to the S&P 500 as well. And in doing so, it\u2019s really helped people manage risk and still participate on the upside. So, it\u2019s been a great performer; we\u2019re very proud of it. SCHOLER: Talk to us about some of the holdings within this fund that could be good options for some of our viewers, especially in this environment. STOCKTON: So what TACK does, it uses sector rotation as its primary strategy and what\u2019s great about the ETF wrapper around that kind of strategy is it limits some of the tax implications of trading in and out of these sectors, Spider ETFs (STT) that we use. So we have a a wrapper around this strategy and by moving in and out of the sectors we can leverage their long-term momentum characteristics. We\u2019re using month-end closing data to limit some of the noise of the market, of which there\u2019s plenty of it of course, yes. And we also use asset allocation to limit drawdowns and that\u2019s been very successful for us moving portions of the fund into short-term treasuries, long-term treasuries, and gold exposure. And that\u2019s helped not only limit the drawdown but sort of manage through a diversified perspective of asset allocation. SCHOLER: In this current market environment, Katie, how should our viewers think about considering TACK within their broader portfolio? STOCKTON: I think of TACK as a very good core long-term holding. Something that ideally you don\u2019t have to worry about a dynamic alternative to buy and hold really and also an alternative to the traditional 60-40 model. So wherever that fits in a portfolio, that\u2019s where TACK can go. I like the idea of having TACK as a core and then building different exposure around it, sort of satellite positions perhaps when the market is very strong and higher beta stocks technology. TACK, by its nature, will have an underweight in technology because we\u2019re equal weighting the sectors about 12.5% when we\u2019re invested in them. So with that in mind, when the market\u2019s on fire, we wanna make sure that we have that technology or growth exposure beefed up. Right now, of course, that\u2019s not the case. SCHOLER: Yeah. How would you describe the current state of the market? STOCKTON: Volatility is obviously picked up as of Q1 here and I think that\u2019s something that was signaled in Q4 if not even sooner than that in our momentum gauges. So the momentum has shifted, it\u2019s not negative on a long-term basis, but it\u2019s definitely gone from strong upside momentum to now something that\u2019s more neutral at best. We have a lot of overbought downturns on the monthly charts as of March, really as of the end of March today. And that is something that suggests that this kind of trading range \u2014 this choppy action \u2014 could stay with the market really for the balance of the year. SCHOLER: Interesting. So holistically, TACK is something that you recommend that our viewers take a look at over the next three years. What are your goals with this fund? STOCKTON: The goal is to see it continue to do really what it\u2019s already done, meaning that it\u2019s built on sort of capital returns. We\u2019re trying to post good returns for our investors of course, but to do so while eliminating that drawdown during riskier tapes like we have right now. Arguably now tech is really compelling in that we can have one sector, we can have eight sectors. So when we have one sector we\u2019d have pretty sizable positions in the gold and the treasuries. And so at any given time it may hold that kind of level of risk off exposure. So it\u2019s something that you can trust to do the work for you effectively. SCHOLER: What are the biggest questions that you\u2019re fielding from clients in this environment? STOCKTON: I think how low can we go and is this a bear cycle or is it just a correction? That\u2019s really the thing that\u2019s on people\u2019s minds right now. Emotions are running pretty high, so we are looking for some kind of relief rally for a better selling opportunity. But with the downdraft, as you could imagine, a lot of things are broken on their charts, meaning that the breakdowns would suggest that we have at least moved into a trading range environment at best. And we\u2019ve seen a real shift out of technology and that\u2019s been associated with this loss of momentum more broadly. So that\u2019s something that\u2019s meaningful, certainly relative to what we got accustomed to last year. SCHOLER: Is there a timeline that you can see on the charts as to how long this might last? STOCKTON: There is actually, and there\u2019s no precision here, but our indicators do give a sense of timelines and for us we have about nine months assigned to this potentially higher volatility environment and this is an environment in which TACK should shine.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Business Insider Edition  President Donald Trump said he would offer US allies a less-capable export version of a coming sixth-gen fighter, but a former top Air Force official has said he doubts they'll want it.          The former secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall said in a podcast interview that he doubted US allies would be willing to buy the coming F-47 stealth fighter because of the high expected cost and concerns over the US's commitments to its longtime alliances.               Speaking on Defense & Aerospace Report's \"Air Power\" podcast late last week, Kendall, who left office in January, said the jet's price, which he said could be up to $180 million each, roughly twice as much as the F-35, could put off US allies.               \"I would be very surprised if our, any of our partners, were prepared to pay that unit cost for a new aircraft,\" he said.               President Donald Trump announced this month that Boeing had been selected to build the new F-47, winning the $20 billion contract over its rival Lockheed Martin. Boeing's share price rose after the announcement, adding $4 billion in market value.               The F-47 Next Generation Air Dominance fighter is expected to be ready for combat by the end of the decade.               The aim is to develop a new sixth-gen fighter aircraft with unmatched stealth and air-to-air combat capabilities, including the ability to fly with uncrewed loyal wingmen drones, to give the US Air Force a technological edge to defeat new threats.               The US has been flying X-plane prototypes in pursuit of this effort.               It's poised to replace the F-22 Raptor, a fifth-generation air dominance\/air superiority fighter that has been in service since 2005. The US, despite pressure, has never exported the F-22, which was built by Lockheed Martin and Boeing.               The other US fifth-generation fighter is the Lockheed F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, which was developed as part of a multinational program. Numerous allies now fly the jet.               Kendall said the Trump administration's attitude toward longtime allies such as Canada and dozens of countries in Europe might lead some to question the wisdom of investing further in really expensive US weapon systems including the coming F-47.               \"Another factor right now, of course, is that the attitude we've taken towards our allies is driving a lot of them to rethink their degree of cooperation and commitment and reliance on US sources for equipment,\" he said.               Kendall also highlighted Trump's claim that the export version of the F-47 sold to US allies could have downgraded capabilities, the reasoning being that allies today might not be allies in the future.               \"We basically have very close allies traditionally, and we share some of the best of our capabilities with them because we have a lot of trust in them,\" Kendall said. \"This administration doesn't seem to be taking that point of view.\"               The F-47 is being designed to fly alongside autonomous drones, known as Collaborative Combat Aircraft. But Kendall said there were questions about how these drones would work with future crewed fighters.               \"There isn't a readiness at this point, a confidence in the uncrewed aircraft to bet entirely on them, right? And I tend to share that view,\" he said.               Drone technology is being deployed across the US military, but autonomous drone technology is still in a heavily experimental phase.               Even so, Kendall said there was an urgent need for the US to upgrade its Air Force, where the average aircraft is about 30 years old.               The planned upgrades come as rivals such as China appear to be investing in the development of new stealth fighters.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"Business Insider Edition  Trading in a Tesla? There's a new TikTok trend for that.          People are posting before-and-after videos of their Tesla trade-ins accompanied by the hashtag \"ByeTesla\" and Taylor Swift's 2017 hit, \"Look What You Made Me Do.\"               As with most viral TikTok trends, the posts mostly follow a similar format. They show a driver backing out of their garage or driveway in their Tesla as the lyrics play: \"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now. Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead.\"       @drewherridge1 Bye Tesla, hello Rivian!#rivian#fyp#tesla#tesler Original Sound - Unknown           Then, the video cuts to the driver pulling up in a new, non-Tesla car to the song's chorus of \"Look what you made me do.\"       @shkimmy Got rid of my #tesler today!!! Girl, bye!   Hello to my new Porsche Macan 4S EV. #byetesla#byeelon#newcar#ev#lookwhatyoumademedo Original Sound - Unknown           Rivian seems to be a popular choice among some of the EV switchers. Several of the videos show Tesla owners opting for a vehicle from the California-based EV maker, such as the Rivian R1S, which starts at around $75,900.               Other videos show owners swapping in their Teslas for other EVs, like a Porsche Macan Electric or a Lexus.       @vanessawade_ Bye bye Tesla  #tesla#byetesla#cadillacescaladeiq @Cadillac #lookwhatyoumademedo Original Sound - Unknown           \"The Tesla sales managers seem so defeated,\" one of the users who posted a video wrote in the caption about the reaction of Tesla sales staffers hearing about why the owners decided to sell their vehicle and cancel their Model Y order. Their video featured a digitally imposed F\u2014k Elon message over their license plate.               Another user\u00a0posted\u00a0a video trading in their Cybertruck for a GMC Hummer EV SUV, which starts at about $98,845, compared to the Cybertruck, which starts at about $99,990. The user wrote in the caption Change is GOOD-when your principles\/morals are important.               The trend seems to have ramped up a few days ago, with many of the #ByeTesla TikToks posted on Sunday and Monday. The posts followed the biggest day yet of\u00a0organized anti-Tesla protests on Saturday when more than 200 demonstrations were scheduled to take place outside Tesla showrooms.               The gatherings on Saturday were part of \"Tesla Takedown,\" which describes itself as a \"peaceful protest movement\" that began in February amid Elon Musk's DOGE involvement. The movement has held protests all over the country, as well as in some locations globally.               The \"ByeTesla\" TikTok trend, however, is further evidence that some Tesla owners are making the decision to sell their vehicles.               Some owners have told BI they sold their Teslas recently following Musk's political involvement with DOGE, with some saying they were concerned about becoming targets of harassment or vandalism, and others sharing with BI that they felt embarrassed to be seen driving them.               Data also suggests that calls to boycott the brand and offload vehicles are impacting Tesla's sales numbers.       Tesla delivery numbers reported by multiple countries have been down in recent months across multiple countries. Wall Street analysts are also expecting weak first-quarter delivery numbers when Tesla reports its official tally later this week.       Used Tesla listings have risen by 33% this year, according to data from Cox Automotive, with one industry expert attributing the trend in part to Musk's influence on the brand name and sales. However, listings for other EVs have also increased by 27% year-to-date and some have also suggested that the increase in Tesla's used EV market is partly a result of its aging lineup.               While some are selling their Teslas, others are holding on to their shares and vehicles \u2014 and buying more in light of backlash against Tesla. One owner recently told BI that after experiencing harassment and vandalism while driving his Cybertruck in a Mardi Gras parade, he decided to buy an additional 185 Tesla shares.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"ByTim Treadgold  ByTim Treadgold,  Contributor.  Australia has not escaped the threat of increased tariffs on its exports to the U.S., but it does have one world-class industry which is reveling in commodity market confusion, gold. Rising production coupled with a rising price has reinvigorated Australian gold which has reclaimed its position as the country\u2019s fourth most valuable commodity export displacing thermal coal to sit behind iron ore, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and steel-making coal. Australia handed anothe gold boom. (Photo by Yoray Liberman\/Getty Images) The upward move by gold could continue if two new investment bank research reports are correct, potentially lifting gold to third spot on the list of Australian commodity exports reviving memories of past gold booms which offset the effects of a wider economic downturn. Both Citi and RBC Capital Markets see the gold price continuing to rise while the Resources Department of the Australian Government is forecasting an increase in national output from 286 tons this year to 309 tons next year, cementing Australia\u2019s position as the world\u2019s third biggest gold producer after Russia and China. The return of gold is a bonus for the Australian Government which has called an election for May 3 with sluggish economic growth a key issue being offset by rising gold income to compensate for falling iron ore, coal and LNG prices. Over the past 12-months as the gold price has risen by 36% to $3089 an ounce, the iron ore price has fallen by 28% to $102 a ton. Gold\u2019s rise in U.S. dollars is magnified in Australia by the currency effect with an exchange current rate of US63 cents delivering an Australian gold price of A$4903\/oz, a record which easily eclipses all earlier gold booms. The share prices of leading Australian gold producers have risen with the gold price. Northern Star, the biggest producer, is up 25%. Evolution, the number two producer, has done better with a rise of 87%. But it\u2019s further down the pecking order where more impressive capital gains are being recorded by stocks such as Catalyst Metals, up 660% and Spartan Resources, up 187% thanks to a takeover bid from rival Ramelius Resources which has risen by a more modest 33%. Australian rock rich in gold. Photographer: Carla Gottgens\/Bloomberg Citi described the current market for gold as \u201ca one in 40-year gift for gold producers\u201d. RBC said a high level of economic uncertainty could see gold rise to $3496 an ounce later this year, up $407\/oz or 13% on the latest gold price of $3089\/oz. RBC said in a noted headed \u201cUncertainty is the Midas touch\u201d that it was clear that economic sentiment has deteriorated, and gold\u2019s appeal is more durable in this environment, meaning elevated prices should hold. Citi said three anomalies were resulting in gold producer profit margins being at a 40-year high. The anomalies are the spot gold price at an all-time high, U.S. interest rates being very high, and the U.S. dollar being relatively strong. \u201cThis gift for miners is not only based on multiple anomalies, it is unique to gold,\u201d Citi said, adding that high-cost gold miner margins are at their highest level since the 1980s, Citi said that using five-year forward prices of $3650\/oz a massive $1700\/oz gap existed between the forward price and the 90th percentile of the all-in mining cost curve. The anomalies identified by Citi are said by the bank to be a gift for goldminers. \u201cThe disconnect between long-dated gold prices and marginal cost happens in gold because there isn\u2019t enough producer hedging relative to consumer borrowing of above ground stocks,\u201d Citi said.

More Mulholland - WPA Pool\/Getty Images) \"The demand from consumers to borrow stock, largely from central banks, means that the long-dated gold curve is also relatively liquid compared to other commodities. \u201cThis presents a relative gift for gold producers, should they choose to accept it, since in other commodities such as oil and copper five-year forward prices are anchored to their marginal cost.\u201d RBC said gold continued to be priced on the basis of uncertainty, and in particular tariff uncertainty. \u201cWhile economic concerns are rising, vibes and sentiment are deteriorating and recession probabilities are rising,\u201d RBC said.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"This article is part of Digiday\u2019s coverage of its Digiday Publishing Summit. More from the series \u2192 It\u2019s been a tough three months for publishers, according to executives who spoke during a closed-door town hall session at the Digiday Publishing Summit in Vail, Colorado, last week. \u201cNot a great quarter. Traffic\u2019s down. Advertisers are very timid in spending. They\u2019re in a wait-and-see mode. So this is definitely the downslope. We expect it to come back, but definitely not a great quarter,\u201d said one publishing exec. Q1 is typically a slow quarter for ad revenue, as post-holiday spending slows and new ad budgets get reset. But the exec said the downturn they\u2019re experiencing now contrasts with the same period in 2024, which was their company\u2019s \u201cbest quarter \u2026 ever.\u201d A few publishing execs in attendance at the event chalked this up to the fact that it\u2019s a \u201cbuyer\u2019s market\u201d right now, putting downward pressure on ad pricing. But what this means for the rest of the year remains to be seen. Advertising firm Magna lowered its 2025 forecast last week, adjusting U.S. year-over-year ad sales growth to 4.3% from 2024, down from the 4.9% growth for 2025 the firm predicted in December. On the connected TV side, a \u201cglut of inventory\u201d from big players like Amazon and Google has put downward pressure on CPMs, another publishing exec said during the Summit town hall. They said ad revenue was a few percentage points higher than last year, but was still lower than expected. And several publishers expressed concern over the rates being made on CTV. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing deals get cut at [$15 and $10 CPMs]. \u2026 That\u2019s just not sustainable, especially for anybody here,\u201d said a publisher exec. \u201cThat\u2019s a slippery slope. Once you go down to [$10 CPMs], you\u2019re never going to go back up.\u201d\u00a0 Meanwhile, the open advertising exchange is also suffering. The same exec said the open market was down \u201cabout 20-ish percent\u201d compared to last year. \u201cWe\u2019re not really able to put a finger as to why that is,\u201d they said. This is reflective of what the wider programmatic market is experiencing. The programmatic ad slump last fall has arguably become a full-on downturn this quarter, according to Digiday\u2019s previous reporting. The open market is down double digits for some publishers. Several execs blamed advertisers\u2019 focus on lower-funnel marketing for the ad spend slowdown, and a drop in demand for custom and branded content. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a decrease of interest [in custom content], because a lot of it is awareness-driven. We\u2019re seeing some of our newsletters and some of our custom products \u2026 decrease, driven by lower-funnel targeting,\u201d said one publishing exec. Another exec in the town hall said they were more often seeing \u201csomething lower-funnel\u201d getting added into custom content, such as a call to action, links that drive to purchase or QR codes. \u201cSo whereas before it was branding and telling stories, [marketers] want to also incorporate something that\u2019s a little bit more lower-funnel to satisfy the demands that they have from their executive team,\u201d the exec said. Upper-funnel marketing like brand awareness campaigns are often the first to get cut during times of economic uncertainty. One exec said they think the \u201cobjective\u201d of custom content has changed \u2014 but that eventually there will be a \u201cbounce back.\u201d \u201cWe are already seeing it in retail media networks \u2026 people wanting to change their objectives to more upper-funnel tactics, which means that retail media networks will just be media networks. So I think we\u2019ll eventually see that bounce back. I just think we\u2019re in this point of constraint,\u201d the same exec added. Another exec said a \u201cmajor advertiser\u201d pulled \u201ca significant amount of money\u201d from upper-funnel activity, and their company saw \u201cdecreases\u201d in leads and other KPIs. Eight months later, \u201cthey came back,\u201d the exec said. \u201cIt\u2019s painful. Sometimes they have to go away for a little while, and then they test the waters, and they see results, and they come back,\u201d they added. Another exec agreed: \u201cWe\u2019re starting to hear a lot more about mid-funnel. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s gonna go right back up to upper-funnel at some point.\u201d Even if TikTok finds a path forward in the U.S., brands and agencies that were previously focused on the platform have learned that this approach is vulnerable to the whims of platforms and regulators. Direct-sold ads continue to be the dominant source of publishers\u2019 revenue as we move out of the first quarter. But other revenue sources are gaining in importance, particularly subscriptions and events. Publishers still can\u2019t make meaningful ad revenue from Apple News despite its push to sell more ad inventory.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"BySabbir Rangwala  BySabbir Rangwala,  Senior Contributor.  Surround ADAS Provides Safety Features for Mass-Market Vehicles Launched in conjunction with Valeo (a Tier 1 automotive supplier), the Surround ADAS\u2122 functionality makes it possible to provide affordable ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) for automotive OEMs like Volkswagen and others. It provides features like hands-free driving on approved highway sections, traffic jam assist, hazard detection, parking assist, driver monitoring, and 360-degree emergency assist. Importantly, the system is designed to be future-proof in hardware, with OTA (Over the Air) software updates as regulations change and more data are analyzed to expand the operating zones. Surround ADAS is strictly for highway driving with an L2 and designation (human driver always in control, hands-free, eyes-on, mind-on). Mobileye provided a comprehensive view of its autonomy platform at CES 2025. (Disclosure: I am an equity investor in Mobileye). The company has a current market capitalization of ~$14B and revenues of $1.8B\/year (easily the leading player in the pure play autonomy landscape). Its customers include ~50 automotive OEMs who use their ADAS based solutions (cameras, chips, software) across 1200 car models and 190M cars. At CES 2025, it announced collaborations for L3 (hands-off, mind-off highway autonomy at prescribed speeds with human driver able to take control within 10 seconds) and L4 (no human driver required in specific Operational Design Domain or ODD) autonomy solutions. Volkswagen is one of Mobileye\u2019s customers across multiple models (VW ID Buzz, Audi, etc.) and advertised the L4-capable ID Buzz vehicle. Valeo is a leading automotive Tier 1 supplier with a strong focus on autonomy and SDV (Software Defined Vehicles). Headquartered in France with revenues of ~$25B\/year, it counts major automotive OEMs as its customers, traditionally for hardware subsystems for electrification, driving assistance, lighting and inside cabin solutions. Products include mechanical, electrical, sensing and electronic components, spanning from motors and lighting assemblies to ultrasonic, camera, radar and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging). The goal is to continue transforming and upgrading its product offerings as the AoT\u2122 (Autonomy of Things) and SDV (software defined vehicles) revolution proceeds. SDV is a response to OEM needs to constantly invent and upgrade features for a new generation of consumers who expect a the same car hardware to deliver improved performance and features over its lifetime (smart-phones anyone?). The heart of the system is the EyeQ\u21226 High System-on-Chip (SoC), developed by Mobileye to support multiple ADAS and autonomy applications (Figure 1): Figure 1:  Mobileye Surround ADAS System It fuses data from two 8 MP (front and rear), four 3 MP (corner) cameras, and five radar units, providing 360\u00b0 perception. The EyeQ\u2122 processor which is part of the ECU, integrates sensor and Mobileye\u2019s proprietary REM (Road Experience Management) data which uses crowd-sourced mapping and traffic data. This is used to issue steering and braking instructions to the ECU. L2 features like lane keeping, automatic lane changes and speed control (from 0 - 80 mph) for highway driving (human driver is always in the loop) are provided (see Figure 2): Figure 2: Surround ADAS Features Mobileye is the Tier 2 supplier for the Surround ADAS system, with Valeo functioning as the Tier 1, responsible for integrating the EyeQ 6 chip and software into its ECU, along with integration of Mobileye approved camera and radar units. Valeo also integrates its self-parking capabilities. This model allows for a single supply chain which ensures simplicity for Volkswagen, and allows each partner to do what it specializes in - Mobileye as a semiconductor and perception software supplier and Valeo as a provider of camera and radar sensors, the ECU electronics, self-parking capabilities and integration support for different car platforms. It results in lower costs, making it possible to offer higher levels of ADAS capability in mass-manufactured, lower cost vehicles. Both companies use their software capabilities to offer OTA updates as capabilities and regulatory requirement evolve. Mobileye offers different level of capabilities for ADAS and autonomy. As shown in Figure 3, while Surround ADAS offers hands-free highway driving and advanced collision avoidance, SuperVision\u2122 offers more advanced and premium L2 features, providing highway and urban driving capabilities with point-to-point navigation (within a defined ODD or Operational Design Domain). SuperVision\u2122 uses two EyeQ6 chips. Mobileye Chauffeur\u2122 is more advanced, and provides L3 functionality (Hands-off and Mind-off). It uses next-generation versions of the EyeQ6 SoCs, its internally developed imaging radar sensors and externally sourced LiDAR sensor from Innoviz Technologies. Figure 3:  Different Levels of L2 and L3 Functionality Offered by Mobileye The roadmap in Figure 3 makes it possible for OEMs to have a full spectrum of solutions to make higher levels of active safety and automation available to both premium and mass-manufactured vehicles. Dan Galves is Mobileye\u2019s Chief Communications Officer. Per Mr. Galves, as a Tier 2 supplier for Surround ADAS, Mobileye has access to video and low bandwidth data generated by the OEM during the testing phase. It also expects to have access to video data during disengagement incidents. For SuperVision and Chauffeur, Mobileye will function as the Tier 1 supplier. These systems will also be designed with OTA software upgradeability, and allow access to all the crowd-sourced data to further improve its autonomous capabilities towards L4 and L5 driving. Per Galves, \u201cMobileye Surround ADAS\u2122 represents the next generation of ADAS, delivering advanced safety and highway hands-off driving to mass-market vehicles, through a vertically integrated solution running on our EyeQ6 High SoC on a single ECU. It leverages Mobileye\u2019s autonomous vehicle development in a cost-efficient package, enabling automakers to address emerging consumer demands and ensure alignment with expanding safety regulations\u201d. Democratizing safety and convenience features in mass-manufactured, lower price models provides volume efficiencies across the supply chain and enables costs reduction in the premium version of ADAS and autonomy features. Software upgradeability is also transferable between these car segments, leading to economies of scale and faster verification and deployment cycles.

{"date":"2025-03-31","content":"You should buy a car from Elon Musk\u2019s company\u2014but only if it\u2019s used. Produced by ElevenLabs and  News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app. In Los Angeles, where I live, you don\u2019t expect to be heckled while driving an electric car to the grocery store. But on a recent afternoon, a couple of men on bikes saw the Tesla logo on the front of my car and shouted, \u201cFuck you, Tesla guy\u201d as I rolled by with the windows down. I bought my Tesla Model 3 in 2019, after my wife and I moved from New York to L.A. and needed a car. Not willing to burn gasoline, we got the most practical EV we could afford. Six years later, that car carries a different connotation.  In the aftermath of Elon Musk\u2019s MAGA embrace and his scorched-earth tactics running DOGE, Tesla has become a primary target for protests. On Saturday, demonstrators marched outside all 277 Tesla showrooms and service centers in the United States; Teslas across the country have been vandalized and even destroyed in recent weeks. Even in Los Angeles, where Teslas are as familiar as Fords and not primarily viewed as right-wing totems, this wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d been shouted at since the election. Tesla owners who don\u2019t support Musk are playing defense. Some have begun to slap on bumper stickers such as I bought this before Elon went crazy. Others are simply done. Sheryl Crow sold her Tesla and donated the money to NPR; Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona also got rid of his, saying he couldn\u2019t stand to own a car that is a \u201crolling billboard for a man dismantling our government and hurting people.\u201d Teslas that are eight years old or newer now account for 1.4 percent of all car trade-ins, up from 0.4 percent a year ago, and EV brands such as Lucid and Polestar offer tantalizing deals to Tesla drivers looking for an out. \u201cYou\u2019re definitely seeing a lot of people say, \u2018You know what? I don\u2019t want to be associated with the trash that\u2019s going on right now around Elon Musk,\u2019\u201d Robby DeGraff, an analyst at AutoPacific, told me. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m just going to get rid of my car.\u2019\u201d The Great Tesla Sell-Off is producing a glut of politically tainted pre-owned cars. Used Teslas are now shockingly cheap: One 2021 Model 3 for sale near me, which would have cost more than $50,000 new, is going for less than $20,000. Even if you resent Musk, you should consider buying one. In this moment of DOGE madness, it\u2019s difficult to see a Tesla as anything other than an avatar of Musk. But Elon doesn\u2019t make any money off the Model Y you get secondhand. Strip away the symbolism, and an old Tesla is just a good, affordable car. Read: My day inside America\u2019s most hated car No, you shouldn\u2019t buy a new Tesla if you\u2019re enraged at Musk. The boycotters are correct that rejecting these vehicles directly hurts him. It drives down sales numbers, which hurts Tesla\u2019s bottom line and saps the company\u2019s stock price. Tesla\u2019s remarkable valuation, buoyed as much by a cult of personality as by the company\u2019s sales figures, has made Musk the world\u2019s richest person: The company was worth three times more than Toyota in 2024, despite selling six times fewer vehicles. Even so, collapsing sales, not only in the U.S. but also across Europe and Australia, have wiped out billions of dollars from Tesla\u2019s stock.  Buying a pre-owned Tesla might feel just as unseemly. But it\u2019s not. Start with the sustainability question. Anti-Musk liberals would surely agree that more Americans should go electric to cut carbon emissions. Only about one in 10 registered vehicles in America is an EV, so it\u2019s likely that a used-Tesla buyer will be replacing an old gas-burner. The switch might be permanent: More than 90 percent of EV owners say they won\u2019t go back to combustion. For the most part, Tesla refugees aren\u2019t retreating to the polluting purr of the V-6; they\u2019re switching to electric cars from other brands, such as Chevy, Lucid, and Kia.  Used Teslas also help solve the main problem with getting Americans to go electric, which is price. Even with government tax credits, EVs tend to cost a premium compared with gas cars or hybrids. Pre-owned EVs, though, are shockingly affordable. Electric cars in general depreciate faster than gas-powered cars for a number of reasons, including fading battery life and used-car buyers\u2019 unfamiliarity with the technology, Brian Moody, a senior staff editor at Kelley Blue Book, told me. All of this is bad for sellers but good for buyers. Read: America finally has the answer to the biggest problem with EVs Even before the Great Tesla Sell-Off, the bulk of used EVs were Teslas. The math doesn\u2019t lie: Just five years ago, Tesla sold nearly 80 percent of the electric cars in America. Now that virtually every major car company offers EVs, Tesla\u2019s dominance is waning, but most of those non-Tesla EVs have yet to reach their second owners. Used Teslas were already pretty affordable, but now they are getting even cheaper. Moody said the average transaction price for a used Tesla dipped from nearly $32,000 in November to about $30,400 in early March as more flooded the market. Tesla\u2019s resale value is reportedly falling three times as fast as the rest of the used-car market.  Perhaps most important of all: Unless you purchase a used Tesla directly from the company, Musk isn\u2019t getting your money. It\u2019s possible to buy a pre-owned Tesla and avoid his other revenue streams too. Just like every carmaker, Tesla maintains a network of service centers to repair its vehicle, and because so few car mechanics specialize in electric vehicles, paying Tesla to do the work is much easier (and can feel safer) than taking a gamble on your neighborhood repair guy. However, a used car is likely to be past its four-year basic warranty, so you could take your old Model Y to an independent shop without voiding any coverage.  Then there is the question of charging. Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network is admittedly excellent and convenient. But that is relevant for more than Tesla owners. Over the past couple of years, the rest of the industry has adopted Tesla\u2019s plug standard, and many other brands\u2019 EVs can now visit the company\u2019s fast-charging stations. Musk-hating Rivian owners might still find themselves paying him for kilowatt-hours in a pinch. Still, avoiding them is easier than you might think. EV newbies tend to fret about charging, given that plugging in a car is still not as simple or quick as pulling into the nearest Shell. But the anxiety tends to be exaggerated. Something like 80 percent of EV owners primarily charge at home, which provides enough electricity for daily driving. On road trips, drivers can plan ahead to make a point of visiting charging stations that aren\u2019t owned by Tesla.  Of course, a used Tesla may not spare you from getting shouted at while you\u2019re getting groceries. Buying any kind of Tesla in 2025 can practically feel like an invitation to get graffitied, or at least a tacit endorsement of the brand. But set aside the optics\u2014no simple task\u2014and a pre-owned Tesla is just as climate-virtuous as all the Chevy Bolts and Ford Mustang Mach-Es that aren\u2019t carrying around any MAGA baggage. Refusing an old Model 3 doesn\u2019t hurt Elon or help the planet. But it does stop you from getting a good deal. If you\u2019re still feeling trepidation, consider an apology bumper sticker: I bought it from someone who bought it before Elon was crazy.","label":0}

They're great daily drivers, great track cars, even great for drifting if you really know your way around that short wheelbase.

The paths laid out before a Miata owner are well-trodden, and require little creativity to follow.\u00a0 Luckily for those of us with joy left in our hearts, not every Miata has to be so serious. Some owners care not what the greater car community has decided are appropriate use cases for the MX-5, and instead build their Mazda as they see fit. There are still Miata owners out there willing to jack an NA up on off-road tires, slap a turbo on the intake and feed it with a snorkel, and clamp a roof rack to the ever-so-sought-after OEM hardtop, and for that we should all be thankful.\u00a0  This Miata is built to be something different. It looks at all the things that forumgoers say Miatas are supposed to be, all the \"correct\" ways to build an NA, and chooses a different route. Look at that massive front bumper, with its winch and yellow fogs. This is a bad track car. It's a bad drift car. It's almost certainly a worse daily driver than a stock NA.

No matter how specific your car's intent is, either from the factory or from the aftermarket following it builds, you can always do whatever you want with it forever.

The UCLA Anderson School of Management published earlier this month an official \u201cRecession Watch\u201d for the first time in its 73 years of economic forecasts, as economist Clement Bohr issued a scathing assessment of Trump\u2019s economic policies, writing the Recession Watch \u201cserves as a warning to the current administration: be careful what you wish for because, if all your wishes come true, you could very well be the author of a deep recession.\u201d A recession is \u201centirely avoidable\u201d if Trump\u2019s signature economic policies, including the most severe tariffs in nearly a century and the public sector\u2019s dismantling at the hands of Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), are \u201cpared back or phased in more gradually,\u201d according to Bohr. Moody\u2019s Analytics\u2019 chief economist Mark Zandi struck a similar chord in a March 19 interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cEarly Start with Rahel Solomon,\u201d saying it \u201cfeels like we're being pushed into recession\u201d by Trump. \u201cThe recession risks are uncomfortably high and they're rising,\u201d declared Zandi, adding he believes the odds of a recession are \u201cless than 50-50, but it really does depend on the president and what he does here.\u201d Trump braced Americans for a possible recession in a Fox News interview aired March 9, when he would not rule out the possibility of a recession, cautioning Americans for a period of economic \u201ctransition\u201d as his policies take hold and noting he\u2019s paying little attention to stock market losses. In subsequent media appearances, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent similarly declined to dismiss a potential recession and said the U.S. will go through a \u201cdetox period.\u201d Bessent told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in an interview out Sunday he believes it \u201cwould have been much healthier if someone had put the brakes\u201d on ahead of the Great Recession. The likelihood of a recession \u201chas moved up but it\u2019s not high,\u201d Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve and the highest-ranking monetary policy official, told reporters Wednesday, quelling fears in a downtrodden economic news cycle. The technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth in gross domestic product, a comprehensive measure of all goods and services produced in a country. The official quarterly GDP stats haven't turned negative yet, but the Atlanta Federal Reserve's real-time model ignited concerns beginning Feb. 28 by calling for negative annual GDP growth in 2025's first quarter. The Atlanta Fed calls for -1.4% annual GGP growth during Q1, which would be the worst reading since 2020, even when accounting for a surge in gold imports. A CNBC survey of economists call for slightly positive GDP expansion at 0.3%. Stock prices don\u2019t completely correlate with economic growth, but equity investors are clearly pricing in increased odds of a down stretch for the U.S. economy. The S&P 500 dove into a 10% correction earlier this month, wiping out some $5 trillion in market value in less than a month\u2019s time, led by stocks considered the most vulnerable to a slowdown, including artificial intelligence darling Nvidia and Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla. Bank of America\u2019s monthly survey of global fund managers released this month revealed some 63% of these influential investors expect the global economy to weaken over the next year, making March the second biggest jump in macroeconomic pessimism since the poll\u2019s 1994 inception. The survey also revealed fund managers fled to cash this month at the highest rate since March 2020 and moved away from U.S. stocks at their fastest pace on record, signaling an unraveling of faith in stateside equities. The fund managers heavily agree White House policy is the single biggest risk, with 55% of respondents citing a tariff-driven trade war sending the global economy into a recession as the top threat and 13% naming actions from Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency sending the U.S. into a recession as the biggest risk. The Bank of America survey was conducted March 7-13 among 205 global fund managers who collectively manage $477 billion in assets. Elsewhere in financial markets, a flight to government-issued debt is evidence of a thirst for safer returns in the face of a potential recession, as yields for benchmark 10-year Treasury bonds have dropped by more than 25 basis points over the past two months (lower yields mean bonds got more valuable). But the most common bond market signal of a recession, the inversion of the yield curve, in which longer-term bonds have lower yields than shorter-dated ones, has actually normalized in recent months. The New York Fed\u2019s bond-linked recession model calls for just 27% recession odds over the next year, down from the more than 70% odds in late 2023, a period which failed to materialize into a full-blown recession. Perhaps the most concerning signal over the last is a breakdown in everyday Americans\u2019 conviction in the economy, as the Conference Baord\u2019s closely watched consumer confidence survey tumbled this month to its lowest level since 2021. That tracks with weaker spending, as February retail sales grew by just 0.2% from January to February, according to a report released March 17 by the Census Bureau, far worse than the 0.6% month-over-month increase projected by economists. One of the most important hallmarks of the American economy, the labor market has shown some cracks in early 2025 as job creation slowed and layoffs spiked, but remains overwhelmingly strong, as February\u2019s 4.1% unemployment rate sits well within the healthy historic norm. A key labor market recession indicator, the Sahm rule, flashes a far lower likelihood of a recession than it did when it peaked last summer, inspiring a short-lived market selloff in August. Trading in two of the world\u2019s most precious commodities certainly point to the prospect of a global recession. Gold prices are up more than 10% this year to a record $3,100 per troy ounce as investors flood into the historic safe haven asset, while prices for international benchmark Brent Crude sank this month to their lowest point since 2021 as traders braced for a potential global weakening in oil demand as economic activity slows. Bessent and Trump have made clear they are lasered in on lowering interest rates, which are determined by the politically independent Fed. Typically, rates are only drastically cut during periods of economic distress, as lower rates typically stimulate economic growth as households and businesses are more likely to borrow with lower interest costs, though that uptick in loan activity can simultaneously lead to higher inflation as demand rises. The Fed is likely to hold off on further rate cuts \u201cuntil tariff policy becomes clearer,\u201d according to David Mericle, Goldman\u2019s chief U.S. economist. \u201cCracks are forming in the economy's foundation,\u201d Lydia Boussour, senior economist at EY-Parthenon, wrote in emailed comments Monday. \u201cWhile we don\u2019t anticipate an outright pullback in consumer spending, recession risks are rising,\u201d Boussour continued.
