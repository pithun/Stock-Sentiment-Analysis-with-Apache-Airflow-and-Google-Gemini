{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"Business Insider Edition  While proprietary trading giants like Jane Street, Citadel Securities, and XTX Markets have dominated headlines in recent years, Hudson River Trading has quietly grown into a global powerhouse in its own right.          In 2024, HRT's net trading revenue hit nearly $8 billion, an all-time high, according to people familiar with the matter. They asked to remain anonymous because the information is private.               Like most of its competitors, HRT is private and reports little information publicly, so it's unclear how those results compare with prior years. But a research note from S&P Global said that through September, HRT had nearly doubled its earnings compared with 2023. The ratings agency said this helped increase the firm's credit rating one notch and illustrated HRT's success in diversifying and expanding its business.               Its larger rivals Jane Street and Citadel Securities were also on pace for record years in 2024, Bloomberg reported.               The bulk of the HRT trading profits \u2014 roughly half \u2014 come from the high-frequency trading business at its roots, known internally as its Classic business. But HRT has greatly expanded over the past half-decade, evolving into new markets and asset classes, such as systematic credit. The firm is now earning billions in profits from hedge-fund-style trading strategies that require greater risk and longer holding periods, and a unit dedicated to such strategies called Prism has become a key profit driver, the people said.               A spokesman for HRT declined to comment.               Founded in 2002 by a group of Harvard and MIT computer science and mathematics specialists, including Jason Carroll, a current managing partner, HRT is among the cadre of private trading firms that capitalized on the electronic-trading evolution in the late 1990s and 2000s, applying algorithms and state-of-the-art technology to markets.               HRT started out trading US cash equities and now handles 10% of the total stock-trading volume. But it has expanded significantly, trading in more than 200 markets across an array of asset classes, including futures, fixed income, currencies, options, and crypto.               The expansion has doubled the firm's size over the past four years. HRT now has 14 offices around the world, with locations in global trading hubs but also in Austin; Boulder, Colorado; Shanghai; Mumbai, India; and Dublin. Employee head count has climbed to 1,110 from 500 in 2021.               HRT's equity capital base has grown sixteenfold since 2018, according to S&P.               In 2021, in a rare external media appearance, HRT revealed plans to build out a wholesale market-making business \u2014 handling order flow from brokers like Fidelity or Charles Schwab \u2014 to capitalize on the explosion of retail stock trading. It had grown that operation into a 4.7% market share by the end of September, according to S&P, though it's still far behind the likes of Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial.               Proprietary trading firms have become dominant forces, wresting billions in market share from global investment banks in recent years. Many firms experienced a jolt to their businesses in 2020 and 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to record market volatility and a substantial increase in retail trading.               Most firms grew, but some have had more success than others. According to the financial publication International Financing Review, analysts estimate that in 2024, Jane Street, now the industry Goliath, reaped $20 billion and Citadel Securities about $10 billion.               They have long lurked as secretive market players that mint billions of dollars in the shadows. Because they manage their own money, unlike hedge funds that do it on behalf of outside investors, they report little information to the outside world.               While they remain closely guarded, this has started to change in recent years as their sizes and ambitions have ballooned. To fund their expansion, firms like Jane Street, Citadel Securities, and HRT have tapped debt capital markets, giving creditors and ratings agencies a peek under the hood.               HRT issued a $2.1 billion term loan in November, primarily to refinance and extend existing liabilities. In research reports related to the debt offering, both Moody's and S&P noted that HRT consistently had strong earnings across a more diverse set of strategies since 2022.               \"Sturdy and consistent trading profits have led to improvements in HRT's funding and liquidity, evidenced by consistent growth in trading capital, equity capital, and related improvements in its trading capital\/debt,\" Moody's said.               Prop trading firms have traditionally relied on automated programs and speed to mint their profits \u2014 continuously buying and selling securities almost instantaneously and collecting tiny profits that add up to millions of dollars a day.               But there's a finite pool of money in market making, and it's fiercely fought over. Prop trading firms have increasingly dipped their toes into strategies more associated with hedge funds, where potentially even greater profits, but also risks, lie.               So-called mid-frequency strategies can happen over minutes, hours, or even days. Profits are won by the strength of predictive signals, developed through onerous statistical research and increasingly aided by artificial intelligence.               At HRT, Prism is the marquee unit focused on such trades \u2014 an increasingly profitable operation that generated more than $2 billion last year, according to people familiar with the business. Strategies span asset classes including equities, futures, rates, and credit, but ETF arbitrage and index rebalance have been noteworthy and profitable strategies in recent years, the people said.               Equity statistical arbitrage and quant macro are newer units that have also driven recent growth in head count and profits, the people familiar with the matter said.               While still automated and mathematically driven, longer-duration trades require more capital and come with greater risks. There's more time for markets and savvier opponents to move against you \u2014 winning signals can decay, and predictions can go awry.               According to S&P, the reality of such risks reared its head in the second quarter of 2022, a rare instance of HRT posting a loss. That August, Moody's downgraded HRT, citing increased risks that \"leave HRT more susceptible to trading losses.\"               But since then, Moody's wrote in its November credit opinion, HRT has produced \"robust, consistent trading profits across a more diverse range of products and strategies,\" even as market volatility faded and spreads in market making tightened.

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"Own a Bus Pirate 5? Now, it can do power glitching, thanks to [Matt Brugman\u2019s] demo and contributions to the stock code. This is also a great demo of Bus Pirate\u2019s capabilities and programmability! All you need is the Bus Pirate and a generic Arduino \u2013 load a glitch-vulnerable code example into the Arduino, get yourself a generic FET-based glitching setup, and you too can play. The Arduino board outputs data over UART, and that\u2019s used as a trigger for the Bus Pirate\u2019s new glitch feature \u2013 now mainline, thanks to [Matt]\u2019s pull request. It\u2019s pretty feature-complete, too \u2014 all parameters are configurable, it can vary the glitching interval, as one would want, and the code checks for success conditions so that it can retry glitching automatically. In this demo, it only took six consecutive attempts to successfully glitch the ATMega328P \u2013 wouldn\u2019t you know it, the code that got glitched was pulled almost wholesale from an IoT device. Glitching remains an underappreciated vector for reverse-engineering, and there\u2019s really no shortage of hacks it allows you to do \u2013 get yourself a FET, a Bus Pirate, or maybe just an ESP8266, and join the glitching-aware hackers club! Want to know more about the Bus Pirate 5? Check out our hands-on review of the hacker multi-tool from last year. ESP32 c compiler and hardware platforms issues with Arduino Board Manage caused esp32 board driver urLS reporting bad links. Latest attempt to get a esp32 platform working resulted in Arduino crashing the gcc c compiler trying to compile 64 bit multiply. Uninstall of Arduino required to fix gcc c compiler issue. ATMega328 UNO R3 hardware install with 64 bit multiply seemed to indicate Arduino c compiler supports gcc c with the exception of printf. We have many esp32 platforms we will try to get working without Arduino IDE. The Bus Pirate and Travis Goodspeed\u2019s GoodFET were the tools that got me interested in hardware hacking years ago. It\u2019s great to see how much the Bus Pirate has evolved over the years. Thanks for keeping the project alive. This seems like an excellent way to learn the art of glitching.

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"I'm 48, use social media occasionally, and I'm not very tech-savvy. Until recently I'd never used Telegram. But last year, after meeting the family of Ronan Kanda - the 16-year-old who was killed in a case of mistaken identity by two other teenagers who'd bought a sword and machete online - I decided to figure out how easy it was to buy a knife from social media. It seemed like the children in the case were able to buy huge, deadly weapons with shocking ease. So in spring 2024, I set up several social media accounts in the name of a fake 18-year-old man. He is a Londoner who is friends with a group of young men who carry knives. He thinks he needs one too, to protect himself, and he knows larger knives are more intimidating. I got myself a separate mobile so my new searches would not impact my usual browsing algorithms. I started searching for knives, liking and following accounts which offered content. The groups contained images of young men posing with knives, videos of close-ups of the blades, and some had videos of knife fights. Very quickly my new social media accounts started showing me more similar content. A familiar pattern emerged. Knives were being advertised in posts on Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, with sellers directing buyers in their bio to their Telegram channels - encrypted groups where videos, photos and prices of knives for sale were openly shared. Within hours of starting my searches I found and joined my first Telegram group selling banned weapons. There were zombie knives, machetes, switchblades and swords. Twenty-two-inch machetes cost \u00a340 and 24-inch zombie knives were \u00a350 - with new stock arriving soon. The seller was based in Walsall and promised delivery to the Birmingham area for \u00a35. Days later, a message went up saying the machetes and zombie knives had sold out. Then a poll went up, asking \"Should I get stab-proof vests?\" Fifty-six subscribers answered. A few weeks later, stab vests were available to buy. Within a few weeks I found more than 10 social media accounts offering illegal knives for sale. It didn't take long for me to learn the slang used for terms like knife seller, flick knife and zombie knife. Knives were offered in a range of colours - gold, silver, red and blue being the most common. Sellers uploaded photos of their parcels, naming the courier companies they were using to \"guarantee quick delivery\". In some groups buyers had written reviews after receiving their knives - \"banging quality these\" and \"vouched - nice one bro\". There were deals too. One group offered discounts on bulk buying, \u00a35 off second orders, and the chance for members to win knives and knuckledusters for free. As far as I could see, none of the groups were doing any kind of age verification. Some were closed down during the nine months I observed them on Telegram, including one called Shanks R Us. But most of them stayed active the whole time. Many routinely posted that they were out of stock, and apologised for the inconvenience. In September 2024, the government introduced legislation making it an imprisonable offence to own or sell zombie-style knives and machetes. This added them to a long list of prohibited knives. It's clear they are now getting harder to get a hold of. In one group, the admin says they are getting zombie knives manufactured and shipped from abroad - Malaysia, Pakistan and China - and it's taking longer than usual. The admin brags that \"all [their] shipments land\", and now they're focusing on \"bulk stock for the future\u2026 meaning the knives should be cheaper\". But despite this, the trade is still going strong. On 14 February, I see a message on a group that's grown from zero to 600 members in just a few months reading: \"Happy Valentine's Day to da ladies out there, grab your mans a tool for Valentine's Day, make sure he's safe.\" Many of the knives being sold are clearly illegal - but some aren't. The sale of legal knives over Telegram is not technically forbidden, as you don't need a licence or registration to sell them. It is, however, illegal to publish material encouraging the use of a knife as a weapon. In spring 2025, the Home Office intends to launch a consultation into a registration scheme for selling knives online - which would require sellers of all knives, including regular kitchen knives, to sign up. The Offensive Weapons Act states that there should be a system in place for age verification on sale and for delivery, but there's no evidence that this takes place in the social media groups I've been in. I contacted the social media platforms to ask what they were doing to curb this harmful content. Snapchat said selling weapons, including knives, was explicitly banned on the platform and that it actively worked to remove such content.   It said action was taken against violators of the policy - like disabling accounts. It also said it supported police investigations and had a team working around the clock to respond to authorities' data requests. Similarly, TikTok said the trade of dangerous weapons was prohibited and that in the third quarter of 2024, 96% of clips that breached guidelines were removed before being reported. It said sharp knives, regardless of size, were not allowed to be sold on TikTok Shop. It added it worked closely with government and police to understand changes in knife crime, and assisted police enquiries.   I reached out to Meta too - which hasn't yet provided a comment. Previously a spokeswoman told the Times that the promotion and sale of weapons on Meta's platforms was banned, and that such content was removed when found. She added that in 2024, Meta met other tech firms, the Home Office, Ofcom and officials to understand how to work together to tackle the issue. Telegram said the sale of illegal goods was forbidden by its terms of service and its hundreds of moderators use custom AI and machine learning tools to monitor public parts of the platform. It said it responds to user reports and removes millions of pieces of harmful content. In addition, the platform said it aids police in investigations and will disclose the IP address and phone number of criminals who breach its terms of service in response to a \"valid legal request\". It also said it is in \"constant contact\" with Ofcom and the Home Office. Murdered teen Ronan Kanda's sister told the BBC that his murderer \"didn't have any problems collecting his knife from his local post office\". His mother, Pooja, was adamant that the online sale of bladed articles had played a \"crucial role\" in the tragedy. \"A 16-year-old managed to get these weapons online and sold these weapons to other people,\" she said. Following his death the government has announced a series of new measures known as Ronan's Law, including stiffer sentences for selling knives to under-18s. \"Out of tragedy comes a light,\" said Pooja. \"The light we all need.\" But she stressed \"there's so much more we can do.\" Right now, it's still incredibly easy to buy lethal blades on social media. The 24-year-old groomed his 14-year-old victim over social media platform Snapchat, police say.  Teenager Kitty says sometimes her stammer makes her feel it would be easier if she didn't speak. Kalani Smith, aka Kalani Ghost Hunter, returns to Staffordshire to try an \"absolute monster\". Social media company wins US emergency ruling preventing ex-director from publicising her book.

Lenovo keeps finding new ways to stuff huge screens into otherwise plain productivity laptops. by  Antonio G. Di Benedetto Photography by Allison Johnson \/ The Verge Lenovo has another funky experiment it\u2019s announcing at Mobile World Congress: the ThinkBook \u201ccodename Flip\u201d AI PC Concept. It\u2019s a productivity \/ business laptop with a flexible display, allowing it to be used as a traditional 13.1-inch clamshell, a folded-up 12.9-inch tablet, or a laptop with an extra-tall 18.1-inch vertical screen. The ThinkBook Flip uses the same OLED panel as the $3,500 ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 that\u2019s expected to arrive sometime in June \u2014 only here, it\u2019s set up to fold behind the main portion of the screen instead of extend out from underneath it. That means there are no motors, which could bring costs down, and none of the display is left sitting unused inside the chassis \u2014 hence the Flip\u2019s 0.4 inches of extra screen real estate over the Gen 6. When folded back, the Flip can be used like a normal 13-inch clamshell laptop, albeit with nearly half its screen facing backward. You can use that rear-facing portion to mirror or extend your display and present to someone else without the need for an external monitor or projector, or just leave it blank. But the real star of the show is when you flip the screen up to get all 18.1 inches \/ 2000 x 2664 resolution of glorious OLED for yourself. In addition to being able to view long documents and websites, it puts the webcam and top portion of the screen at a pleasing and neck-relieving eye level. Outside of its screen, the Flip\u2019s other unique feature is its Smart ForcePad trackpad. It offers three color-coded layers of LED-illuminated touch shortcuts and media controls you can call up within the pad itself. They can transform the trackpad into a number pad, offer shortcuts to functions like the Snipping Tool or a mute button for your mic, or serve as an app launcher. Samuel Shang, principal researcher of Lenovo Research, told me the company\u2019s dream setup would be to replace the touchpad with a smartphone display, but that would be too costly. The basic illuminated icons offered a fair compromise. While the Flip is still in the concept phase, Lenovo does have some estimated specs for what would go inside, which seems like a promising sign this laptop will actually come to market. It\u2019ll use an Intel Ultra 7 processor, 32GB of LPDDR5X RAM, PCIe SSD storage, Thunderbolt 4 ports, and feature a fingerprint reader. The ThinkBook Flip I got to see in a brief demo ahead of MWC was an early prototype that still felt fragile and a little rough around the edges. It was far from the ready-to-ship rollable ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 I saw at CES, which I didn\u2019t have to treat so delicately. But my colleague Allison Johnson saw another prototype of the Flip in Barcelona at MWC that already looked a little further along and less janky. There\u2019s always a chance that this concept never goes beyond the prototype phase, but since it\u2019s borrowing components from the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6, the odds may be in its favor. The Flip may make sense as an alternate offering if its lack of motors means it can be offered at a lower price than its rollable cousin. I know I personally always want to see more funky laptops, and it\u2019d be cool to get multiple flavors of these tall boys.

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"An emoji buddy for my laptop? I\u2019m in. An emoji buddy for my laptop? I\u2019m in. by  Antonio G. Di Benedetto Lenovo is throwing ideas at the wall with new modular accessories for the magnetic Magic Bay connector of its ThinkBook 16P Gen 6 laptop. At Mobile World Congress 2025, the company announced four different proof-of-concept add-ons that may or may not ever be released, and they\u2019re as cool as they are quirky: There aren\u2019t many details on the concepts yet, though the 2nd Display and Dual Display are the most straightforward. They\u2019re meant for people who want a mobile multimonitor setup that doesn\u2019t require a secondary device to plug in or keep charged. The 2nd Display is like attaching an 8-inch iPad Mini to your laptop, with a vertical orientation that could be great for social feeds and communication apps like Slack or Microsoft Teams. It has a panel with a 1920 x 1200-pixel resolution and 60Hz, which is plenty of resolution for a small screen. The Dual Display Concept takes the ThinkBook 16P Gen 6 and turns it into a triple-monitor setup. The two attachable displays are each 13.3 inches with 2880 x 1920-pixel resolution and 120Hz refresh. They weigh a hefty 2.62 pounds, nearly as heavy as carrying a 13-inch MacBook Air with your ThinkBook. I saw this setup and the 2nd Display Concept in an early in-person preview, and while having a triple-monitor laptop seemed awesome, it was also just a lot. The Dual Display Concept was cumbersome to set up, fold down, and put away. On the other hand, the 2nd Display was easy to work with and felt like a no-brainer if it ever comes to market. As for the pair of Tiko concepts, I didn\u2019t get to see them but they\u2019re such different ideas sharing the same name. Lenovo doesn\u2019t have many details yet on the Tiko Pro horizontal screen attachment, but having an additional display for widgets seems nifty. I bet its teleprompter function would sell many units on that sole feature. But the Tiko emoji friend looks like an absolute charmer. It\u2019s a circular screen to display what Lenovo calls \u201ca compact AI emotional interaction companion\u201d that \u201chelps users stay informed and engaged throughout their workday.\u201d I\u2019m all about emojis, and this is an emoji buddy you can attach to your laptop. It looks similar to the aptly named AI Buddy that Lenovo showed at its recent Tech World conference, which was designed for a desktop. The Buddy was a voice-enabled AI chatbot that could also take actions on your computer for you. The Tiko Pro, at least based on Lenovo\u2019s early indications, seems more like a lighthearted plaything you can casually interact with. For example, you can make a heart hand gesture at it and it\u2019ll react with hearts, and you can put it in a cute cat case \u2014 complete with a tail! I don\u2019t know why the business-focused ThinkBook 16P Gen 6 is simultaneously the platform for multimonitor features for power users and a digital equivalent to an emotional support animal, but I\u2019m here for it regardless. Let\u2019s see if any of these concepts survive the cutting room floor.

I don't think it would even be a good idea to pay off the national debt. I am more talking about the deficit. Which I think we should as nation be structuring towards a budget that is balanced at least over time.

With his handling of the \"negotiations\" with Putin, were he essentially gave everything away without any advantages, I am beginning to think Trump does not know how to make deals. Like, at all. He had a successful TV show. He's a Russian asset.  What else is there to say? \"He had a successful TV show.\" No, he did not.  Trump was an actor on someone else's successful TV show. Trump starred in and co-produced the show. I think that qualifies as his show to a reasonable extent. The point being, a shitty but successful show is his only successful non-con business venture. Indeed. Well, is there _anything_ that Trump can do well? Except manipulating a specific class of voters, that is. I mean, he is not even a good liar, prolific as he is in that activity.

They were checking press passes closely enough to keep AP and Reuters out, you really think they weren't checking credentials? \"TASS was not on the approved list of media for today\u2019s pool,\" a White House official told CNN in a statement. \"As soon as   we realized other people knew he was from TASS and we got caught , he was e  How do you sneak into the Oval Office? The white house just took over press pool admittance. They let anybody in? Lying to get access to the president, someone would be arrested right? Oh look, going back to the whataboutism well. We're not talking about that.  We're talking about a foreign national, working for state propaganda \"media\" attending a press event in one of the most secure rooms in the world \"uninvited\" and somehow no aides, communications staff who know all the White House correspondents, or the United States Secret Service ever asked any questions until someone publicly identified them as a TASS reporter. So either everyone is fantastically incompetent at security, or you're  Yes, because we all know that random people are just allowed to walk into the Oval Office with the sitting President, VP, and foreign dignitaries without being invited, and without being questioned or at least checked to see if they're on an approved list. For your excuse to even remotely be true, it would mean that they broke into the White House and somehow slipped past all the US Secret Service and uniformed Marines that guard the place, and never had their credentials checked by anyone, at any time. Does  No conspiracy theory.  He went to Russia in 1987.  When he came back, he paid for full page ads that attacked NATO, in several major US papers.  He's an asset. Yep. It is becoming clearer and clearer. Putin probably has some nice videos with Trump engaging in unnatural sexual acts. What Trump currently does makes absolutely no sense unless Putin has some real power over him. Anyone who lived through the cold war should know that it was SOP for the Eastern services to create kompromat on VIP visitors to their countries. Given Donny's sexual apatite coming by this should have been as easy a taking candy from a baby. Then of course there's now two former KGB agents on the record who claim that our Donnie boy was recruited back in the eighties. This article, which is highly skeptical of the claim, reports on these  on the record statements by the former KGB men. https:\/\/www.indiatoday.in\/worl... [indiatoday.in] Ironically the reason that they are skeptical is that they cannot believe that the FBI could have possibly ignored that a presidential candidate was this profoundly compromised. And here's what the Indian journos missed: This was the guy in charge of the FBI office in NYC which was tasked with the counterintelligence investigation: https:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/US\/fbi-... [go.com] Convicted for for working with a Russian oligarch. The plot thickens. Well, lets hope this still gets exposed, so Trump can spend the rest of his days in a cell. On the other hand, maybe that is Putin's endgame for the destruction of the US: publicly expose Trump. Now that would create some real waves. Well, we live in the age of generative AI, and Donnie boy has a cult following. The MAGA crowd will always believe their golden calf over anyone else. I think the damage that he will inflict on Medicaid and SS will have a more tangible effect. That's his \"Plan B\" for sure. \"Plan A\" is to have Trump make so many self-inflicted wounds that Putin has plausible deniability of involvement. It's win \/ win for him. Why let your crazy conspiracy stop there?If he is a Russian asset, then there is also plausibility that China have several democrats as Chinese assets. Do we have European Union assets? Can African countries have foreign assets in America?  Did the Saudis have Bush as their foreign asset?I doubt Trump is directly compromised and works with a Russian handler.  However, he's easily manipulated (which is why there was no 2nd debate with Harris), and Putin has been able to push him in ways favorable to Russia.  So, Trump is a Russian asset in that sense.Is there at least one Democrat that works directly with Russian handlers?  Almost certain so.  Are any of them President of the United States?  The mathematical probably is zero right now and likely zero considering all past presidents. Why let your crazy conspiracy stop there?

He was ranting about how poor old Putin was accused of election interference by helping Trump, but it turned out to be \"untrue\" (it was true, Mueller said there was solid evidence of it). Clearly Trump sees a reflection of himself in Putin, and admires the man. That is extremely dangerous. Both parties the same?  Funny, I must've missed when Biden ran his crypto scam. Plus, since I've got a dog in that whole culture war fight, yes there's absolutely a difference when one party is using their legislative power to punch down at sexual minorities.  I'm fucking tired of hearing \"Oh, you're just gay, the Republicans are cool with that now.\"  No, they aren't, they're still actively trying to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges.  [nbcnews.com]  Now don't get me wrong, I'm mad at the Democrats too.  We're in this mess yet a I just watched a video of that Schriver guy and... Damn if that's not a guy trying to strip gay rights in order to deny and hide his own sexuality. He only thinks he's a master dealmaker because he ran a big business that pushed a lot of little businesses around. He never had to negotiate a deal where he didn't have an overwhelming power advantage before becoming President. That makes a lot of sense. So essentially the only thing Trump is good at is being a bully. Well, he just demonstrated that publicly. But then, he does not really seem to be good at being a bully either. Two people against one, the one not a native speaker, the two on their home territory, the wohle thing probably planned and the intended victim still did not cower. Totally agreed.

This guy is not fit to be President of his local Rotary club, much less head-of-state for a country. If he plans to use taxpayer money (or most likely, debt spending) to buy cryptocurrency, that technically can't fail.  It's a dumb idea and a waste of money, but if the goal is to have the US government become a cryptocurrency bag holder, that's an easy achievement to unlock. Cryptocurrency itself probably isn't going away anytime soon.  Its value certainly could (and probably will) crater, but there's too many true believers (and criminals) for us to be lucky enough for it to ever go away completely.  Worst  It's always a game of 3D chess with these folks.With Trump it's more like checkers. And he ignores the rules. And he keeps tipping over the board.

Bunch of bleeding heart vegans, ultimately bent on causing the extinction of every domesticated animal species (it's true, look it up). My brother raises chickens.  They literally do not give a single care in the world over where they're gonna pop out an egg.  Seriously, they lay them everywhere.  You'd have to be a member of some brainwashed cult to come to the conclusion that there's any sort of ethical dilemma in eating something that the chickens don't even notice is gone. On my father-in-law's farm, on more than one occasion I've seen a cow hide her calf and then forget where they left it... although mama cow does get upset when that happens, unlike the chickens and their eggs. That was apropos of nothing, in case anyone is wondering.  Seriously, they lay them everywhere.But that's horseshit. Had chickens for years when I was a young adult. They lay in their boxes- if they have them, and they are clean.  They care very much where they lay their eggs.  Seriously, they lay them everywhere. But that's horseshit.

My brother has a proper coop and he keeps it clean, but the chickens free range over his rather large multi-acre land and yup, eggs frequently turn up where you'd least expect them.

The bribes are out in the open: \"SEC halts fraud prosecution of Chinese national who sent Trump millions\" https:\/\/popular.info\/p\/breakin... [popular.info] It sounds like you think it was a bribe in an illegal sense (and I definitely do). I agree that there's unlikely to be proof and that even if there is, I doubt it'll be investigated. But that doesn't mean it wasn't an illegal bribe, just that it's not provable. schrodinger's bribe Even if they're not bribes they're at least violations of the emoluments clause, although the legal system is too slow to bring a case on that against a President within a single term as we saw last time. Even if he does stay in office for more than 4 years so that the case has time to proceed against him, the immunity granted to him by the Supreme Court would make such a case pointless, just as with any bribery case presumably. Even if they're not bribes they're at least violations of the emoluments clause  Probably not because POTUS could make the argument that he does not have direct control over the organizations that are running these crypto funds.

All crypto that the US seizes is being held for a very long time. Two things ought to happen: (1) the value at seizure is recorded and tracked from thereon out. The data are publicly available. (2) We all watch how long it would take to steal any of these assets. Think if it as a test portfolio. Except with real crypto (lol, \"real\" crypto).

As if it was some sort of mystery instead of a knowable fact. Crypto is not legal tender and I for one will never accept it. They've tried. I always have some wise-ass that wants to pay me in crypto. I not only demand actual currency; but the minute they try to pay with crypto their contracts are terminated and outstanding payment is demanded *in cash*. The people paying in crypto are only doing it to fuck the person they're paying. It's no better than theft. It might be worse than theft.

But isn't that just the thing with conspiracies, how easy it is to link two only tangentially related things and draw really outsized conclusions based on that link even if the scale of evidence is nowhere approaching that? In the chemtrail example, sure we have a thing that happened but is there anything about Operation Sea Spray that gives evidence to the idea that there is something nefarious in the vapor trails of commercial airliners or even military aircraft, especially when we already know for certain fact that vapour trails are a natural phenomenon of turbo and jet fan engines?  It's kinda perfect conspiracy bait since the trails are always there. \"The origin of this conspiracy has some validity to it therefore the conspiracy that sprung from it must also have validity even if there is no evidence\" is something of a fallacy.  All of those examples follow this logic and it doesn't make the conspiracies around them anything more than unevidenced claims. It doesn't also help that the primary media proponents don't actually believe in them either, the \"true believer\" style \"Lone Gunmen\" are kinda dead and replaced with malicious actors who use these conspiracies for ulterior motives.

It's a real thing and we aren't even sure how well it works. Nothing in those links draws the line between \"cloud seeding is a thing that is possible and maybe works sometimes?\" into the conspiracy that weather events are and are currently being manipulated in a malicious fashion.  It doesn't anywhere and don't pretend like we don't know what the weather control conspiracy is, it is not \"sometimes regions use cloud seeding\". Nor is there anything about chemtrails in there so, thank you for making my point. I can assume everything else is just about as irrelevant. Also clever little trick to turn the legal definition of conspiracy and conflate it with common \"conspiracy theories\".  You did the thing again! \"Nothing you posted contradicts what i said about weather manipulation\" You didn't look very hard, since the science org piece specifically mentions geo-engineering. The corresponding Harvard link desribes \"an albedo modification technique that aims to increase the reflectivity, and possibly even the lifetimes, of certain clouds.\" Maybe this is the missing thought for your confusion: \"chemtrails\" are the observation of cloud seeding or albedo modificiation techniques. Or here's another new thought for you: if  MKUltra, COINTELPRO, Operation Mockingbird, Iran-Contra, Gulf of Tonkin, the 1933 Business Plot, Jekyll Island and the Fed formation, the overthrow of Iranian democratically elected government to benefit BP, Operation Northwoods, the shit Wikileaks and Citizen Four revealed to name just a few.

No really, he totally did. That several million nutty conspiracy theorists predicted that he would beforehand means nothing.  It was a coincidence, that is all.

[thehill.com] Now do climate change.  Conspiracy is clearly defined as a secret cooperation between people to the detriment of others. This happens all the time, and in many situations, it happens for legitimate reasons. An undercover investigation is a legal instrument for the prosecution, and it is to the detriment of the perpetrators of a crime.   A conspiracy theory instead claims something a) would be to the detriment of a diffuse us, b) was intentional and c) constructs an unproven collusion between likely diffuse groups and d) often fails to construct a plausible gain for the postulated members of the collusion and replaces it with the members simply being evil. It dismisses alternative explanations outright and re-adapts itself to attribute the alternative explanations as part of the conspiracy.   No flat-earther can give a sufficient reason for the members of the round-earth conspiracy to insist on the spheroid shape of Earth, and they also fail to provide any evidence for the belief in a round earth to be bad for us. But they insist, that the \"Round Earthers lie to us, because they are evil.\" You are touching on a critical distinction between real conspiracies, and conspiracy theories. Real conspiracies involve details: specific places, actions, and people, who engage in subversive behavior. the list you provided, is a good example. We have details for each of these conspiracies. Conspiracy *theories*, on the other hand, are vague and suggestive, but never include details. \"They\" don't want you to know, \"shadowy, powerful people\" are really controlling things. I don't think these AIs will have trouble distinguishing between the two. First comes the theory, then you gather evidence (or not. Or evidence you're wrong). Conspiracy theorists notably don't respond to evidence they are wrong. Remember the My Pillow Guy, who claimed to show \"absolute proof\" of vote tampering by shadowy foreigners, and offered $5 million to anyone who could prove him wrong? Yeah, some guy proved him wrong, and convinced a judge that he had proved him wrong. Did that lead to the My Pillow Guy or his followers, admitting they were wrong? Not in the least. https:\/\/apnews.com\/article\/mik...  [apnews.com]  Did Alex Jones admit he was wrong, when confronted in court > Conspiracy theorists notably don't respond to evidence they are wrong. That's how you perceive it, because they are no true Scotsmen to you. By not considering people, who explore a conspiracy theory and reject it (or confirm it with real evidence), as conspiracy theorists, you define the term to only include people who react to evidence like you described. It's true. If someone believes a conspiracy exists, and proves or disproves it through evidence, then that is not *by definition* a conspiracy theory. It's an actual conspiracy (or not). Conspiracy theories aren't based on evidence, they are based on hearsay or on an assumption that events *couldn't possibly* have happened without some sort of conspiracy.

Good theories are minimal according to Occam's razor, i.e., you try to need as few preconditions to be true as possible. But in the end a theory does not need to be true, it is only a construct that can be true, if all its preconditions happen to be true.

What I have found is that these LLMs (particularly ChatGPT) are somewhat conciliatory, ready to presume any question asked of them is a legitimate one, and going out of their way to tailor responses accordingly. To put it another way, they're good at bullshitting when you ask them a bullshit question. You know, I was just thinking that the silly people who came up with this idea don't really understand how conspiracy theories work. Even if ChatGPT could do this, it would likely only be a matter of a few days before a new round of conspiracy theories went viral - ones that warned about all the nefarious things these \"AI\"s were really designed to do. Self-reported behavior isn't a good measurement of anything other than what a subject would say to an interviewer. Self-reported *future* behavior is even less tethered to reality.

I mean, sure, Bigfoot does not exist, but some \"conspiracy theories\" turn out to be true.   Training AIs to push certain points of view is, in the end, it's own kind of conspiracy.

Fascinating paper. Non-paywalled preprint here. [osf.io] The authors claim that AI\u2014specifically GPT-4\u2014can persuade conspiracy theorists to dial down their beliefs by about 20%. Even better, that shift sticks around for at least a couple of months. Participants in the study described the specific conspiracy they believed, GPT-4 challenged it with tailored evidence, and boom\u2014significantly lower belief afterward. This effect spilled over to other conspiracies as well, suggesting that personalized debunking really can change minds. Interestingly, they also noted that the same superpowered persuasion that deflates conspiracies could just as easily prop them up. AI\u2019s a double-edged sword\u2014researchers used it here to provide well-referenced counterarguments, yet there\u2019s nothing stopping bad actors from flipping the script and turbo-charging conspiratorial nonsense at scale.

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"ByMichael Foster  ByMichael Foster , Contributor.  Bonds the word on wooden cubes Here\u2019s where I see stocks now: Yes, we\u2019ve got some legitimate concerns as some economic warning signs appear\u2014and run up against the tech-driven optimism that\u2019s powered stocks to lofty heights. The result? Volatility. So today we\u2019re going to look at a couple quick moves we can make to both protect ourselves and tap into the bargain income opportunities\u2014including a 10.6%-paying closed-end fund\u2014that times like this always turn up. For that, we\u2019re really talking about two things. First up, we\u2019re going to add income plays beyond stocks. Specifically, we\u2019re going to look at corporate bond\u2013focused CEFs, many of which are paying double-digit yields and are poised to tack on serious price gains as the economy slows. Second, we\u2019re going to do something most investors overlook (or just plain don\u2019t want to do): Cull (or at least trim back) holdings that have gotten a little too overvalued in the last couple years. That last part is key, because before you know it, a rising asset can take up more of your portfolio than it should, leaving you vulnerable in a broader market crash. Let\u2019s start with those bond CEFs\u2014one in particular. Then we\u2019ll go to (I admit, a bit of an extreme) example of a fund that\u2019s risen further into the stratosphere than, frankly, any CEF I\u2019ve ever seen. Over at my CEF Insider service, my members and I have been rallying behind corporate bond\u2013focused CEFs for a while now. The Fed, as we all know, is keeping rates higher for longer than anyone expected a year ago. That\u2019s allowed bond-focused CEFs to use this time to buy more high-yield bonds and lock in the high payouts they, in turn, are sending out to investors. Moreover, those bonds will gain in value as rates fall, since they\u2019ll be worth more than newly issued, lower-yielding bonds. The fact that corporate defaults remain low is also adding to corporate bonds\u2019 value. Both factors have given our CEF Insider portfolio\u2019s corporate-debt bucket a push this year. One particular holding that looks particularly attractive right now is the Western Asset High Income Opportunity Fund (HIO), payer of a 10.6% dividend. This fund is also still sporting a discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), as I write this, currently around 2%. Its bonds also have a weighted average duration of 6.8 years, helping it lock in its current income stream for the long haul. HIO has returned a solid 24% since we bought it in the February 2024 CEF Insider issue, and thanks to its outsized (and monthly paid) dividend, pretty well all of that return has been in the form of reinvested payouts. In other words, HIO, which mainly holds bond issued by large cap US companies, has done exactly what we want it to: Keep its price more or less stable so we can collect its rich payout without having to worry. What\u2019s more, that payout has grown during our holding period, too. The best part is, we can still get HIO at a discount, despite its appeal. That\u2019s a very nice setup for us. Now let\u2019s talk about the second part of our strategy here\u2014cutting back on stocks and funds that have seen their valuations rise to unreasonable levels. For an example here, let\u2019s literally move from the sublime (HIO) to the ridiculous: A CEF called the Destiny Tech100 Fund (DXYZ).  Before I go further, let me say that this fund is instantly off our radar because it pays no dividend. But humor me here, because this is still an interesting, and unique, fund to look at, for no other reason than that it shows the wide variety of assets we can tap into through CEFs. The first number that pops out at us is this fund\u2019s frankly wild 807% premium to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), according to the CEF Connect fund screener. This massive markup is due to its portfolio, which consists of privately held firms. That would seem to be a positive, since we can\u2019t buy shares of these companies ourselves. DXYZ Holdings As you can see above, over a third of the fund is dedicated to Elon Musk\u2019s privately held SpaceX. Musk, of course, is controversial, but he does have a, shall we say, enthusiastic, fan base. That\u2019s likely part of the reason for DXYZ\u2019s high premium. Other investments, like Axiom Space, Boom Supersonic and OpenAI, are speculative, to say the least. Basically, buying this fund means we\u2019re buying into a specific vision of the future, where these companies wind up being leaders. But even if that comes to pass, that has already been priced into (and then some!) that ridiculous triple-digit premium. That premium also exposes the fund\u2019s market price to a big drop in the event of a broader stock-market selloff. Since DXYZ\u2019s holdings are private, we can\u2019t look back at their performance histories over the long haul. But we can look at some publicly traded equivalents to get a sense of what a broad market drawdown could do to the fund. Take Tesla (TSLA), which really took it on the chin in 2022, shedding nearly two-thirds of its value that year. As for the other space stocks in DXYZ, the collapse of Virgin Galactic Holdings (SPCE) since its IPO offers another example of how volatile this business can be. Maybe this time is different, but with DXYZ\u2019s huge markup, we\u2019re overpaying to speculate on the future, especially if earthly economic woes replace moonshot optimism among the technorati in the next few months. There\u2019s just no reason to take that risk. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

My favorite camera phone from last year is better than ever thanks to a new periscope lens. by  Dominic Preston If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. After two years telling anyone who\u2019d listen that Chinese manufacturer Vivo made the best cameras in any smartphone, last year\u2019s Xiaomi 14 Ultra changed my tune. It became my favorite phone and camera, handling everything from holiday snaps to product review photoshoots.  With the 15 Ultra, Xiaomi took the best and made it better with a new 200-megapixel periscope lens to complement the other (largely unchanged) cameras. The downside? The 14 Ultra was never much of a looker, and the 15 Ultra\u2019s enormous, asymmetrical camera module has taken a bad design and made it worse. I\u2019m willing to put up with the awkward aesthetic when the camera is this good, but I\u2019d be pretty understanding if you went the other way. 8 Verge Score Fantastic camera performance, especially the periscopeFlagship specs across the boardStrong battery life Frankly, quite uglyOther than the periscope, it\u2019s a lot like the 14 UltraHyperOS occasionally gets on my nerves I haven\u2019t mentioned much about this phone\u2019s specs yet beyond the camera. That\u2019s intentional. Yes, this is a flagship phone through and through, but you can find most of what it offers on other phones for half the price. If you\u2019re willing to drop \u00a31,299 \/ \u20ac1,499 (around $1,600) on the 15 Ultra, the camera will be the reason why. Much like the 14 Ultra, Xiaomi\u2019s new flagship has a quadruple rear camera laid out in a large, round module that dominates the design. Charitably, you could say this evokes the classic Leica aesthetic that Xiaomi is also nodding to with this silver and black finish, further accentuated by the optional Photography Kit accessory. Less charitably, you could say it\u2019s quite ugly, not helped by a less symmetrical lens layout than last year, adding to the sense that Xiaomi is desperately trying to cram the hardware in. That layout is probably forced by the new 4.3x periscope lens, which uses a 200-megapixel 1\/1.4-inch-type sensor and a fast f\/2.6 aperture. This is an upgrade on last year\u2019s in every respect except the zoom distance, down slightly from 5x, and the results really are impressive.  On the 14 Ultra, I found myself trying to use the 3.2x telephoto as often as possible, and this year, the periscope had the same captivating effect on me. I keep stepping back from subjects to give me the excuse to use it instead of the main lens, preferring its natural depth and bokeh compared to the flattening effect that any phone\u2019s primary lens tends to offer. In good lighting, you\u2019ll get beautiful, natural shots at up to 10x, with decent results at 30x. Beyond that \u2014 going all the way up to 120x \u2014 some aggressive sharpening kicks in. I wouldn\u2019t consider this anything special at extreme range, but for mid-distance, it\u2019s pretty perfect. The other three lenses \u2014 all 50-megapixel \u2014 are no slouches, either. The main camera uses the same one-inch-type Sony LYT-900 sensor as last year, but Xiaomi has ditched the variable aperture in favor of a fixed f\/1.63 approach. In theory, it makes this lens a little less versatile, but I don\u2019t think much is lost in practice. Still, it\u2019s an odd downgrade. The regular telephoto uses the same spec as last year\u2019s equivalent but with 3x zoom rather than 3.2x. This was my favorite lens last year, and I think it\u2019s still the most useful here. 3x is a more practical distance than 4.3x much of the time, and this is also the lens used automatically for macro shots, allowing you to take close-ups without actually getting close. The ultrawide and selfie lenses are the most forgettable: they\u2019re good but unremarkable. It would be a little unfair to call them afterthoughts, but they\u2019re clearly not where Xiaomi\u2019s focus lies. Beyond simply slapping an enormous periscope in, Xiaomi\u2019s other focus has been improving photography performance in low light. I run a food newsletter on the side, so I spend a lot of time trying to photograph dishes in dimly lit restaurants, exactly where most phones struggle. I loved the 14 Ultra, in part because it excels in those conditions, even on its telephoto. And on the 15 Ultra, the same is true, though I\u2019m not sure this phone marks a significant step forward. The new periscope\u2019s performance is impressive, though: it\u2019s a slight drop-off from the 3x lens, being slightly more susceptible to glare from bright lights in dark surroundings and requiring a steadier hand to get a crisp shot.  The biggest complaint I could muster about this camera is that it\u2019s not that different from last year\u2019s. If you don\u2019t own the 14 Ultra, then that won\u2019t be an issue for you, but it might be one for Xiaomi. Competition at this end of the market is intense, especially in China, and I wonder if rivals like Vivo and Oppo are about to usurp the throne. Get beyond the camera, and the 15 Ultra still impresses, but it feels similar to other flagships. The specs all sound familiar: a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage; a large 6.73-inch 120Hz LTPO OLED display; an IP68 rating with reinforced glass for the display. I don\u2019t want to suggest any of this is bad \u2014 it\u2019s top of the line. There are just a lot of other phones crowding for space at the top with it. Battery life is good. The 5,410mAh capacity is generous, and it took a travel day with lots of photography and a couple of hours hotspotting my laptop before I started to worry about it dying. 90W wired charging will top it up quickly, with 80W wireless speeds if you invest in the official charger and significantly slower speeds on a standard Qi pad. Like almost every other Android OEM, Xiaomi still hasn\u2019t felt the need to invest in Qi2. The software is where you\u2019ll find downsides. HyperOS \u2014 Xiaomi\u2019s Android skin \u2014 runs on top of Android 15 and shares annoyances in common with other takes on Android from Chinese OEMs. You\u2019ll find a lot of Xiaomi-branded apps preinstalled, a few of which you can\u2019t remove, plus a smattering of other apps you might not want, like AliExpress. Xiaomi removed some of the OS\u2019s customizability in its latest version. If there\u2019s a way to have five apps on a homescreen row rather than four, I haven\u2019t found it, despite having exactly that enabled on my 14 Ultra. A few other tasks just feel cumbersome and irritating \u2014 changing the wallpaper means forcing your way through a Themes app intent on selling you new ringtones and naff graphics. Almost all of this can be ignored. I\u2019d probably say I prefer HyperOS to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy UI, but you will have to live with a little less polish. The promise of four generations of Android OS updates and six years of security support also lags a few years behind Samsung and Google, though it\u2019s still a decent run. The best and worst things about the 15 Ultra come down to its camera. I think the one thing most likely to put anyone off buying this phone \u2014 price aside \u2014 is that the lens module is a bit of an eyesore. It\u2019s the first thing anyone I\u2019ve seen in the past week has noticed about the phone, and not in a good way.  But then you start using the camera, and you get it. Yes, it\u2019s ugly. But there was probably no other way to make it this damn good.

Published onMarch 2, 2025  At\u00a0the launch of the\u00a0Galaxy S25 series, Samsung and Google announced that\u00a0Gemini would support select Samsung apps. Now, Google has confirmed that its chatbot will support similar integrations with select Xiaomi apps. Erik Kay, vice president of engineering at Android, took to the stage during the Xiaomi 15 series launch event at MWC to announce the upcoming Gemini integration. Kay confirmed that the chatbot will soon support Xiaomi\u2019s stock clock, calendar, and notes apps but did not detail the supported actions. Based on what we know about the Gemini extensions for Samsung\u2019s apps, we believe the extension for Xiaomi\u2019s clock app could allow users to create and edit alarms, start and stop timers, and control the stopwatch. The extension for the calendar app will likely let users create and edit events and search for existing events in a specified date range. Lastly, the notes extension could help users create and summarize notes or retrieve existing notes based on descriptions or titles. At the moment, we don\u2019t have a definite release timeline for these new Gemini extensions. However, we expect Google to release the extensions to the new Xiaomi 15 and Xiaomi 15 Ultra in the coming weeks. Whether these Gemini extensions will be limited to Xiaomi\u2019s latest flagships or roll out to older models remains unclear. We\u2019ll update this post with additional details, including information about the supported actions, once the extensions become available.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"For the maker looking to turn their project into a business, trying to price your widget can be a bit of a conundrum. You want to share your widget with the world without going broke in the process. What if you could achieve both, letting the end user finish assembly? [PDF] While over a decade has passed since Harvard Business School released this study on what they dub \u201cThe IKEA Effect,\u201d we suspect that most of it will still be relevant given the slow pace of human behavior change. In short, when you make someone become part of the process of manufacturing or assembling their stuff, it makes them value it more highly than if it was already all put together in the box. Interestingly, the researchers found \u201cthat consumers believe that their self-made products rival those of experts,\u201d and that this is true regardless of whether these people consider themselves to be DIY enthusiasts or not. This only holds if the person is successful though, so it\u2019s critical to have good instructions. If you have a mass market item in the works, you probably don\u2019t want to require someone with no experience to solder something, but as IKEA has shown, nearly anybody can handle some hex screws and Allen wrenches. If you\u2019re looking for more advice on how to get your invention in people\u2019s hands, how about this Supercon talk by Carrie Sundra about manufacturing on a shoestring budget or this video from Simone Giertz on her experiences with manufacturing from idea to finished product. You might want to steer clear of people promising patents for pennies on commercials, though. This same phenomenon is why Betty Crocker cake mix require cracking in an egg. Originally the mix contained powdered egg protein and didn\u2019t require adding an actual raw egg, but focus groups found people believed the outcome to be better and felt like they actually made the cake, if they had to crack an egg. The cake mix story is a myth. It became a myth when marketing companies started using it as an example of the effectiveness of marketing, essentially marketing marketing. https:\/\/cantrell.medium.com\/the-myth-of-the-instant-cake-mix-a45aaac8b302 You see, the primary customer of a marketing agency is not the consumer they\u2019re selling the products to, but the business. That means the marketing itself doesn\u2019t need to be effective so long as the business that bought it believes it was, which is a matter of\u2026 marketing. Unfortunately that website is not the original article I remembered, but an AI generated copy. This was the original: https:\/\/www.snopes.com\/fact-check\/something-eggstra\/ \u201c\u201dwhile Dichter\u2019s work was influential, its precise role in the success of the cake mix is unclear.\u201d For starters, although it may not have been a point articulated by the homemakers Dichter surveyed, the fact was that fresh eggs produced superior cakes. Using complete mixes which included dried eggs resulted in cakes that stuck to the pan, had poor texture, had a shorter shelf life, and often tasted too strongly of eggs.\u201d Besides, one of the co-authors of the IKEA effect paper was later caught fabricating data for behavioral science research. With the replication crisis still going on, it\u2019s just as well the IKEA effect too is bunk science. Turns out it does replicate: https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/publication\/310491448_The_IKEA_Effect_A_Conceptual_Replication But this paper reveals a different reason for the effect: psychological ownership. \u201cOur results show that the IKEA e\ufb00ect also prevails when companies integrate their customers into the value creation process by giving them control and decision power over the product portfolio.\u201d That is, the IKEA effect doesn\u2019t come so much from the manual effort you spend on assembling the product, but from the feeling of control over it. Here you have the traditional self-positivity bias where people judge their own choices and decisions to be good by default to avoid cognitive dissonance, which translates to valuing something higher if you had anything to do with its existence \u2013 be it simply choosing a custom color or deciding whether the drawer is on the left or the right side of the table. That makes it special, which makes it better, because you made it so. Can confirm! Just assembled a second monitor on a movable arm yesterday. Assembled the arm myself, instructions were clear enough. Now I don\u2019t have to alt-tab again and again just to switch between schematics and layout. The person in the image is wondering where all their money went, after opening an empty box, right? Wondering what the ikea support might have told them to make them smile after that?? It illustrates the critical part often forgotten by makers that want to sell their widgets: even if documentation and assembly instructions are perfect, kits must be backed up by great customer support. Also, don\u2019t fall into the trap implied by the first paragraph: selling your widget as kit instead of finished product may cost you more when accounting for all the time spent on documentation, kitting, and support. The idea of empowering someone by making it easy for them to \u201cmake\u201d something by assembling prepared parts is not new. A century ago, boxed cake mixes came on the scene, allowing someone with little practice or experience to make \u201chome made\u201d cakes. But the real genius came about post-war, when manufacturers omitted the dried egg, and asked the homemaker to provide that ingredient themselves.   That changed it from \u201cadd water, mix, bake\u201d to \u201cmix ingredients that you assembled, blend with some skill, and bake.   It made the baker more invested in the process and made \u201cbetter tasting\u201d cake. That subtle change of one ingredient changed the game: the cake-maker was proud of the product, shared it with friends, and sales took off. I was going to mention this myself. There is some irony in the fact that the powdered egg going into the mix at the factory was probably better calibrated to the mix and may have more predictably made the cake than an egg pulled from the fridge. But the perception matters a lot in this case. Trowing in some extra eggs usually makes cakes taste better. And so do spices, cocoa, raisins, nuts and a lot of other ingredients. In times long gone I sometimes baked my cakes \u201cextra tough\u201d. Not the soft sweet spongy things, but more bread like. They were tough enough to survive a day or two in a rucksack and tasty enough that you did not have to put any other fillings on it. It was the opposite case, and still is. Dried egg powder does not make good cakes. Last time I tried to buy something at ikea, during checkout the (automated) register started asking all kind of stupid questions. Then I understood why the other people before me took so long to get through the payment system I had to wait so long, even though the queue was fairly short. My patience ran out and I just walked away without payment nor my things. \u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202cYou \u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202chad a perfect op\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202cportunity to sp\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202cit on self-checkout and you walked out like a total c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202cu\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202cc\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202ck. Shame on you! surprisingly, i don\u2019t agree with the premise of this article, and i don\u2019t know if that just means i\u2019m an odd duck. i\u2019m thinking about all of the furniture i\u2019ve assembled. first, the good: i\u2019ve had a couple sets of the cheapest sheet-metal shelves, and i value those because they are so configurable.  i\u2019ll have shelves close together and shelves far apart and random doodads hanging off of all of the unused holes.  and there\u2019s lots of cases of furniture that i loved because i modified in it some way.  like i used to have an upholstered arm chair that i had built a little table into one of the arms for my coffee and trackball. but then, the rest: i\u2019ve assembled a bit of ikea furniture, and a lot of the k-mart \/ martha stewart branded stuff of the same quality.  and i don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single exception to the rule that assembling it myself exposed me to how incredibly cheap the materials were.  i valued it less because the act of assembling forced me to confront its particle board nature.  anchors in particle board!  i\u2019ve parted with every single one of those. some of them survived one move but i don\u2019t think any of them survived 2 moves.  some of them even went in the trash, no second owner. ikea furniture is furniture for apartments.  when your lease ends after a year or two, you don\u2019t cry so much if you decide to throw it away.  it\u2019s just good enough that if you stay in one apartment for 5 years, you don\u2019t necessarily have to replace it in all that time. i have a grand old diningroom table that looks like it came from the 1950s.  i got it off the curb when some college kids moved out.  it had been refinished and then painted black and then painted again in beer pong green.  and i stripped all of that off and polyurethaned it.  that makes me appreciate it more, not because of my own labor, but because i\u2019ve proven it\u2019s indefinitely maintainable.  probably my kids will have to cart it out of here when i\u2019m dead. a weird case is a coffee table i had, from salvation army thrift shop.  i had to throw it out because my toddler was eating it, because it was just particle board.  but because i didn\u2019t have to assemble it or anything, the fact that it was particle board never bothered me until lil chompy chomps started chomping on it. Cheap board \u2013 reminds me of a wardrobe I had to assemble. That wardrobe SUCKS and I hate it with a passion. Three of us sweated for 4 hours, and it still came out tilted. The paper-thin backing board couldn\u2019t hold it in shape, when we moved it from flat to up against a wall. Give me sturdy stuff, and I\u2019ll pay someone to carry it for me. Quality flatpack is rarely as good as proper carpentry, but it can still be really really darn good stuff. Quite a bit of the furniture I\u2019ve got started as Ikea parts at least \u2013 just pick the more solid end of their stuff and its a good cheap premade bit of furniture, that comes apart easily if you need to move it. While even the best IKEA offer is still cheap wood, held together by dowel and cam locks rather than great joints and hardwood it is still largely solid pine etc. Now the stuff that is mostly cardboard with a veneer of something isn\u2019t great, certainly doesn\u2019t lend itself to customisation or repair, but still good enough to last quite a while for those times you need something. So I\u2019d suggest you are not overly odd, but you viewpoint is more a product of the quality level of the kit furniture you have interacted with being the really bottom end stuff, mixed with your comprehension of what a quality material for the job would be like. As if you thought all furniture was Cardboard and MDF with a \u201cpretty\u201d skin you\u2019d not know any better, but because you do\u2026 yeah i agree my negative view is based on meeting the low-end of assembled furniture.  but my point is, assembling it made me hate it.  i had a pre-assembled piece of furniture of essentially the same low quality that i liked better because i hadn\u2019t had my nose rubbed in the quality Indeed, but if you had been assembling a good one you\u2019d probably appreciate the quality of design and materials more and thus care about it more not less as is the article premise. That\u2019s the thing \u2013 there are no good ones. If it was made out of real solid wood with proper joinery, you\u2019d need the carpenter to put it together properly. Flat-pack furniture is made to assemble \u201cloosely\u201d so it actually goes together easily, and that results in furniture that tends to be a bit wonky and feels cheap even in the best cases. Combine with being covered in obvious wood imitation vinyl all over, it just doesn\u2019t compare to the real deal. But, you\u2019re right: being exposed to the fact that it is just vinyl covered cardboard makes you treat it with more care \u2013 because you know it cannot be mended. One ding and it\u2019s done. Buy another. It\u2019s furniture that\u2019s designed to look good in a catalogue, which ironically is replaced by computer renderings these days to save the trouble of assembling the set. For example, if you drop something on a wooden table top and it leaves a dent, you can usually put a wet cloth and a hot iron over it, and it\u2019ll pop out. Then re-apply furniture wax and polish etc. On an IKEA table, that\u2019ll ruin the table top. That dent will be there forever. The loose and wobbly kind has always seemed to be what ikea tried to avoid with their flat pack \u2013 it saves them more money if their joints are good so that they don\u2019t have to build them to be able to support the rated load on one good joint and three loose ones, for example. However you can still wreck the joints by hamfisted assembly, disassembly, rougher usage than designed, etc. Just like stripping a bolt can turn a tight, strong metal frame into a wobbly mess, crushing, snapping, or omitting a dowel could do the same. And then once it\u2019s wobbly if you keep using it all the other joints wear out very quickly afterwards. In general, ikea furniture is not overbuilt enough to be mistreated. However unlike most cheap furniture, the dimensions are generally pretty accurate and the tolerances are reasonable. As long as you don\u2019t crush the dowels or fail to set a reasonable tightness on the hex fasteners or whatever, then you can disassemble it and reassemble it without it becoming loose and rattley. Sometimes also, the answer is to not tighten things all the way until everything is in place, and then alternate fasteners just like you do on anything else where tolerances matter, like things with gaskets. But if you jam a dowel in when it doesn\u2019t want to go, maybe it takes the load successfully the first time. But now it\u2019s crushed and if you ever take the pin out again the dimensions are wrong and it\u2019s not going to take the load it\u2019s supposed to take next time. Or if you leave an a bolt loose, then as you use the furniture it will flex and the hole will wallow out and again, now the furniture won\u2019t remain stiff. Or, if you tighten it too much so it bends, then not only is it bent now but next time if you don\u2019t tighten it just as much or more, you don\u2019t get the benefit of the fastener. Oh, and if you let things get bent (metal) or wet (particle board) while you\u2019re moving house, then they may not be the same afterwards. On one of the pages of an Ikea instruction set I doodled two cartoon ikea characters yelling at each other then on the next page the same two plus a divorce  lawyer. . I\u2019m not a huge fan of ikea for many reasons. I\u2019m with the person above- it\u2019s really crap materials but still prices like 80% of what better furniture would be. Unfortunately even \u201cbetter\u201d furniture eg pottery barn is still mostly MDF and engineered \u201cwood\u201d As I get older and grumpier I\u2019m more and more designing and building my own stuff. Not only is it better but I invest the money saved into nice tools too. Examples of that a pin nailer is a game changer and a very nice quality airless sprayer.  Frankly a $2 2\u00d74 prepped and painted is so much nicer, stronger and obv cheaper than pretty much any store bought furniture. I assume this \u201cIKEA effect\u201d is much less pronounced in people who regularly make things, either as their profession or hobby. It\u2019s hard to imagine a cabinet maker or even a  model builder taking much pride in assembling some crappy VITTSJ\u00d6 or KALLAX shelves. The \u201cIKEA effect\u201d doesn\u2019t apply solely to IKEA furniture, y\u2019know. For one example, see the \u201cNotakl\u00f6n\u201d guitar effects pedal kit from JHS Pedals. If it had been released as a normal finished pedal, or a normal component kit, no-one would have paid it any attention, but making it a minimal-assembly-required kit that anyone could build (basically putting a couple of prefab boards into a case) made it a phenomenon. They even deliberately copied the Ikea look & feel. I have a side business that uses this technique.  Though, it is to allow people to save money.  My products are PCBs that have all the surface mount components installed and a bag of through hole parts to install.  Have shipped several thousand boards and have had nothing but rave reviews and just 2 returns. It\u2019s a niche product and I\u2019ll never get rich doing it but it has paid for a lab and shop full of equipment. This is essentially 2\/3 of Tindie. with the benefit of, atleast maybe for while, avoid the cost of type approvals, EMC testing, etc. ? but why people don\u2019t like the software\u2019s that requires assembly and setup? I do. Ive used a ton of cad  software of the last 30 years. My favorite is Rhino primarily because theres so much flexibility in setup and there are so many 3rd party plugins that you can apply to fine tune its capabilities for your  particular use case. one of the takeaways of the study was that unsuccessful\/incomplete assembly causes reduced evaluation. I think the issue is the frustration barrier is too high for many users. This study also forces the user to assemble something, then measures value afterwards. They skip the anxiety of not knowing how to start. I think (and I\u2019m just guessing) that if a user has some prerequisite skills like \u201cknows how to navigate their OS and install software\u201d then they\u2019re more likely to start an easy task like \u201cinstall this program using .msi installer, then edit a text file\u201d. oh You folks are missing the best part of flatpack furniture.

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"ByFrancois Botha  ByFrancois Botha , Senior Contributor.  Like an elephant in a tiny car. How many family offices are there? The family office market is an increasingly significant segment of the global wealth management industry. Yet, despite its growing prominence, there remains a striking lack of consensus on its size, structure, and even its definition. Estimates of the number of family offices worldwide range wildly, from 3,500 to 20,000, depending on the source. Deloitte\u2019s 2024 estimate of 8,030 family offices, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.8% to reach 10,720 by 2030, is one of the more recent attempts to quantify this elusive market. At the same time, some new family office market sizing models are being published. But why is there such disparity in these figures, and what does it tell us about the nature of family offices? More importantly, does size even matter? The family office market is notoriously difficult to size. Unlike publicly traded companies or even traditional wealth management firms, family offices operate in a highly opaque and private manner. This lack of transparency, combined with the absence of a standardized definition, makes it challenging to produce accurate estimates. For instance, EY\u2019s 2016 Family Office Guide estimated there were at least 10,000 family offices worldwide. Since then, estimates from Campden Wealth, IQ-EQ, UBS, Fintrx, With Intelligence, and KPMG have ranged from 3,500 to 20,000. Deloitte\u2019s 2024 estimate of 8,030 family offices, with a projected growth rate of 4.8%, is one of the more precise figures, but even this is based on assumptions that may not hold universally. The problem lies in the criteria used to define a family office. Some estimates focus on assets under management (AUM), using thresholds like $100 million or $250 million. At the same time some new estimates are championing the case for small family offices of only $50 million. Jan Voss, from Cape May advisors recently argued that there are cost-savings to be had even at this scale while also gaining access to other opportunities through the effective implementation of technology. Others consider the number of employees, the range of services offered, or the structure (single-family offices vs. multi-family offices). These differing methodologies naturally lead to varying results. For example, an estimate that includes smaller family offices with lower AUM will yield a larger market size than one that focuses solely on large, institutionalized single-family offices. The lack of consensus on what constitutes a family office significantly contributes to the wide range of estimates. Common criteria include: There are many reasons why estimates are needed for the number of family offices, but normally it would be for products and services sold into the market. These could include technology, reporting services, investment products and services and more. Despite the challenges in sizing the market, there is broad agreement that the family office sector is growing and accelerating. Several factors are driving this trend: While market size estimates are often used for fundraising, market sizing, and strategic planning, they can be misleading if taken at face value. The reality is that the family office market is not homogeneous. It encompasses many entities, from small, informal family offices managing a few hundred million dollars to large, institutionalized operations managing billions. Given the challenges in sizing the family office market, it\u2019s worth considering Simple\u2019s, do-it-yourself (DIY) family office market sizing model that can be adjusted based on specific criteria. Here\u2019s a step-by-step approach: Adjustable market estimates based on the Simple model. While this model provides a useful framework, it\u2019s important to recognize its limitations. The assumed percentages and translation factors are hypothetical and can be adjusted based on further research and specific market definitions. Additionally, this model focuses on the number of family offices, not their AUM or the quality of their services. To estimate market size in terms of AUM, you would need to incorporate data on average AUM per family office. Moreover, qualitative factors like family complexity, investment needs, and desired level of control can influence the decision to establish a family office. These factors are difficult to quantify but are critical to understanding the true nature of the family office market. The family office market is undeniably growing, driven by the rise in global wealth, the increasing complexity of managing investments, and the demand for personalized financial services. However, the wide range of estimates highlights the challenges in accurately sizing this market. The lack of a standardized definition, the opacity of family office operations, and the differing methodologies employed all contribute to the discrepancies. While size is an important factor, it\u2019s not the only one. The quality of services, the alignment of interests, and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances are equally, if not more, important. As the family office market continues to evolve, it\u2019s essential to look beyond the numbers and focus on what truly matters: delivering value to the families they serve.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"ByJack Kelly  ByJack Kelly , Senior Contributor.  Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, accompanied by U.S. President Donald Trump (R), and his son X Musk, ... [+] speaks during an executive order signing in the Oval Office at the White House on February 11, 2025 in Washington, DC. Trump is to sign an executive order implementing the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) \"workforce optimization initiative,\" which, according to Trump, will encourage agencies to limit hiring and reduce the size of the federal government. (Photo by Andrew Harnik\/Getty Images) President Trump\u2019s administration has set its sights on shrinking the federal government\u2019s workforce. It currently stands at approximately 2.3 million civilian employees. On February 26, 2025, Trump signed an Executive Order implementing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Cost Efficiency Initiative, directing agencies to root out potential fraud, and abuse in matters such as contracts, grants, payments, and travel expenses. Agencies were told to centralize technological systems to track payments, accompanied by written justifications, with plans for workforce reductions due by March 13, 2025. One striking measure includes a 4-to-1 replacement ratio\u2014replacing every four terminated employees with just one. There\u2019s also a \u201cdeferred resignation\u201d program allowing workers to receive pay until September 30, 2025, before exiting. Though initially paused by a federal judge, this program has since moved forward, with around 75,000 workers accepting the offer. Additionally, the administration has targeted nearly all of the 220,000 probationary employees\u2014about 9% of the workforce\u2014for layoffs, potentially affecting up to 300,000 individuals when combined with buyouts. This could potentially be one of the largest job cuts in recent history. For affected federal workers, reentering the job market could be challenging. Many scientists, administrators, accountants, finance, compliance, legal and park rangers are highly educated and specialized. Unfortunately, they\u2019re entering a white-collar hiring slowdown. Sectors like tech, finance, and consulting have seen significant declines in openings. It\u2019s taking much longer to find a new job. The market is highly competitive. There are more applicants than job openings. Unemployment benefits generally don't cover what you used to earn. Many federal roles involve niche skills that may not easily translate to private-sector needs. Older workers who want to walk away from the drama may take early retirements. They could face ageism and the need to learn new tech and AI skills. The rate for workers earning over $96,000 at its lowest since 2014. Job security is another concern. The quits rate has been dropping. Workers are now less likely to leave their current positions due to the scarcity of new opportunities. The impact of AI and automation is seen as contributing to this \"white-collar richsecession\". Specific sectors like tech have experienced significant layoffs. For the displaced workers, the timing couldn\u2019t be worse. They\u2019re jumping into a white-collar market that\u2019s already skittish. Companies are hoarding cash and leaning harder on automation and AI to avoid hiring. Take a look at sectors that are still growing like healthcare or skilled trades. This might not be your first choice, but search for a temporary gig job to bridge the gap between finding the role you really desire. Local economies in areas such as Washington D.C., Virginia, and Maryland that have a large number of federal government workers could face an initial downturn in the economy and job market. When people lose their jobs, they tend to spend less money. Even when others are employed, they see their peers getting packaged out of work, and they worry that this could happen to them too. Displaced workers could cause a strain on local businesses as consumers will spend less. If ex-federal workers leave the area, property values and tax revenues could fall. The loss of institutional knowledge and potential disruption to services such as delays in veterans\u2019 benefits or Social Security processing could undermine public trust in government efficiency. Some critics say that the aggressive approach to cutting government programs, contracts, and personnel will cause chaos. The tech vibe of moving quickly and breaking things may not apply to a large government bureaucracy. Once workers are fired or packaged out, there are repercussions. Accomplished professionals in the private sector would likely avoid joining the government, afraid that they\u2019ll be laid off down the road. This could lead to a brain drain. Smart capable professionals will seek out new opportunities elsewhere, even though the job market is challenging. The lack of talent and fewer workers could cause roadblocks in delivering essential services. In the tech sector, people who work at places such as Google and Meta are sometimes placed on performance improvement plans. This is a procedure to determine if the employee has what it takes to thrive in the organization or maybe it\u2019s time to move on to another venture. Musk and the DOGE team could pause on pushing people out and embrace having dialogue with their managers and supervisor to make sure that the government isn\u2019t letting go of the best and brightest.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"In Union County, South Carolina, the sprawling cotton mills that once put bread on the table for many are long gone. Union is also what is termed a \"food desert\", where many residents live far from the nearest supermarket. So in 2016, local non-profit director Elise Ashby began working with farmers to deliver discounted boxes of farm-fresh produce across the county, where 30% of the population is black and roughly 25% live in poverty. To fund this, Ms Ashby first relied on her own savings and then some small-scale grants. But in 2023, the Walmart Foundation - the philanthropic arm of one of America's largest corporations - awarded her over $100,000 (\u00a380,000), as part of a $1.5m programme to fund \"community-based non-profits led by people of colour\". \"I cried a little bit,\" she says. \"It was just one of those times where, like, somebody actually sees what you're doing.\" Two years ago, this was the kind of programme that attracted sponsorship from major companies across America, as the country grappled with racism past and present following the murder of George Floyd, a black man suffocated under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer during an arrest in 2020. But now, those same companies are pulling back. Walmart announced in November that it was ending some of its diversity initiatives, including plans to close its Center for Racial Equity, which supported Ms Ashby's grant. Corporations from Meta and Google to Goldman Sachs and McDonald's have all announced similar changes as part of a larger retreat from diversity, equity and inclusion programmes (DEI) across the corporate landscape. The moment represents a stark cultural shift, fuelled in part by fears of lawsuits, investigations, and social media backlash, as well as relentless pressure from the new president of the United States. Since assuming office in January, Donald Trump has aggressively sought to \"terminate DEI\" and \"restore merit-based opportunity\" in the US. He has directed the federal government to end its DEI programmes and investigate private companies and academic institutions thought to be engaged in \"illegal DEI\". In the early days of his second term, the Veterans Affairs department has closed its DEI offices, the Environmental Protection Agency has placed nearly 200 employees who worked in its civil rights office on paid leave and Trump has fired the top military general, a black man whom his defence secretary had previously said should be fired because of his involvement in \"woke\" DEI. At first sight, it may appear that the US's experiment with policies designed to improve outcomes for specific racial and identity-based groups is finished. But some experts suggest there's another possibility, that some such efforts will continue - but in a different guise, one more suited to the political mood of a country that has just elected a president who has pledged a war on \"woke\". Programmes resembling DEI first emerged in earnest in the US in the 1960s, in the wake of the civil rights movement that fought to protect and expand the rights of black Americans. Under names like \"affirmative action\" and \"equal opportunity\", initially their aim was to reverse the damaging effects of centuries of enslavement of African Americans and decades of discrimination under \"Jim Crow\" laws that enforced racial segregation. As the movement evolved, promoting the rights of women, the LGBT community, and other racial and ethnic groups, use of the terms \"diversity\", \"equity\" and \"inclusion\" became more widespread. DEI programmes in the corporate world and government agencies have often focused on hiring practices and policies emphasising diversity as a commercial benefit. Their supporters say they aim to address disparities affecting people from a range of backgrounds, though a significant emphasis tends to be on race. The programmes saw a huge upswing in 2020 during the social unrest of the Black Lives Matter movement. For example, Walmart committed $100m over five years to its racial equity centre. Wells Fargo appointed its first chief diversity officer; Google and Nike already had theirs in place. After adjusting their hiring practices, companies listed on the S&P 100 added more than 300,000 jobs \u2013 94% of which went to people of colour, according to Bloomberg. But almost as quickly as the pendulum swung left, a conservative backlash began. For Stefan Padfield, executive director of conservative think-tank the National Center for Public Policy Research, DEI programmes are based on a premise that \"divides people on the basis of race and sex\". More recently, these arguments that programmes intended to combat discrimination were themselves discriminatory, particularly against white Americans, have been made with increasing force. Training sessions emphasising concepts like \"white privilege\" and racial bias have drawn particular scrutiny. The roots of this opposition took hold in conservative opposition to critical race theory (CRT), an academic concept which argues racism is endemic to American society. Over time, the campaign to remove books from classrooms that allegedly indoctrinated students into CRT thinking evolved into one focused on \"punishing woke corporations\". Social media accounts like End Wokeness and conservative activists such as Robby Starbuck seized the moment to target companies accused of being \"woke\". Mr Starbuck has taken credit for changes in policy at the likes of Ford, John Deere and Harley-Davidson after he publicised details of their DEI initiatives to his social media followers. One of the clearest signs of this movement's strength came in spring 2023, after a Bud Light partnership with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked right-wing outrage and calls for a boycott of the beer and its parent company Anheuser-Busch. In the aftermath of the campaign, Bud Light sales were 28% lower than usual, a Harvard Business Review analysis found. Another major victory for conservatives arrived in June 2023, when the Supreme Court ruled that race could no longer be considered as a factor in university admissions, reversing decades of affirmative action-based policy. The ruling also cast the legal standing of corporate DEI policies into uncertainty. When Meta made the internal announcement it was cancelling DEI programmes, the company told staff \"the legal and policy landscape\" surrounding DEI had changed. The speed at which some large corporations have shed their DEI policies raises the question of how genuine their commitment to diversifying their workforces was in the first place. Martin Whittaker, chief executive at JUST Capital, a non-profit that surveys Americans on workplace issues, says much of the backtracking comes from companies who were \"rushing to kind of look good\" at the height of the Black Lives Matter movement. But not all are yielding to political and legal pressure. Conservative think-tank the Heritage Foundation noted in a November report that although DEI programmes appear to be trending downwards, \"nearly all\" Fortune 500 companies still list DEI commitments somewhere on their websites. Apple shareholders recently voted to continue diversity programmes at the company. Surveys that measure Americans' support for DEI offer mixed results. JUST Capital's survey suggests support for DEI has declined, but support for issues closely linked to it - such as fair pay - have not. A 2023 survey from the Pew Research Center suggested most employed adults (56%) believed \"focusing on increasing DEI at work is a good thing\". Much rests on the question of whether DEI is actually effective in the first place. Some research has suggested that DEI programmes like diversity training can in fact be harmful. According to one study by researchers from Harvard University and the University of Tel Aviv, trainers commonly report hostility and resistance from employees who feel forced to do the training and threatened by what they see as reverse discrimination; it also says the programmes can often leave trainees feeling more hostility towards other groups. This research has been seized on by DEI's opponents as part of the evidence that \"the best way to improve the lives of all our citizens, and all our neighbours, is to allow the free market to lift all the boats\", as Mr Padfield puts it. The problem with this kind of thinking, according to Siri Chilazi, a researcher focused on gender equity at Harvard University, is that there is no historical precedent to suggest that racial and gender imbalances will correct themselves. Mrs Chilazi says racial and gender barriers still exist and believes DEI solutions focused on \"levelling the playing field for all\" are needed. She cites multiple experiments that show white men disproportionately receive more responses after applying for jobs than women or people of colour. A recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research sent identical CVs to roughly 100 of the largest US companies and found that applicants presumed to be white were contacted by employers 9.5% more often than applicants presumed to be black - with one company contacting presumed white applicants 43% more often. But Mrs Chilazi also says there are genuine issues with many DEI programmes, adding that the most common programmes - including diversity and unconscious bias training and employee resource or affinity groups - are often the least effective. A recent study highlighting the ineffectiveness of some DEI practices said a common issue was treating them as an end goal in themselves, without measurable outcomes. And when it comes to large corporations donating money towards DEI initiatives \u2013 like Walmart's equity centre \u2013 Mrs Chilazi says the problem is that there is not much data to show how effective this is. \"This is an area where we actually don't have good research,\" she says. Where studies have shown DEI to be effective is when it comes to making \"small systemic changes\", she says. There is evidence to suggest replacing open-ended questions in performance evaluations with more specific ones, such as \"what's the one biggest accomplishment of this person last year?\", has shown significant reductions in gender and racial evaluation gaps that can affect pay, according to Mrs Chilazi. Supporters of DEI say the real-world impact of the shift from it can be seen at Harvard University, which was targeted in the landmark Supreme Court case. Last autumn, Harvard Law School reported having only 19 first-year black students among more than 500 students that enrolled, according to the American Bar Association. That was less than half the number from the previous year \u2013 43 \u2013 and the lowest since the 1960s. The law school also saw a significant decline in Hispanic student enrolment, which dropped from 63 to 39 between 2023 and 2024. Colleges and schools have already begun making adjustments in response to the new climate. At one university, a lunar new year celebration was cancelled; another ended a decades-long forum on race. Elsewhere, social clubs for black and Asian students have been disbanded. But the ruling's impact does not appear straightforward. Enrolment numbers for black and Hispanic students at some other top US colleges have actually increased since the Supreme Court's decision. For the freshman class that arrived in the autumn, Northwestern University saw an 11% rise in enrolment for black students and a 13% increase for Hispanic students. Because of results like these, some DEI opponents have accused universities of flouting the court's ruling. But another explanation offered for the increase in diversity at some universities is a shift towards \"socio-economic inclusion\" instead of race and ethnicity - which nonetheless appears to have achieved the same objective. Dartmouth University's Hispanic student enrolment jumped from 9.7% to 12.7% last year, after adjusting to make the school \"more accessible for low- and middle-income families\", it said in a press release. It's clear that the anti-DEI campaigns are having a significant real-world impact. \"I think we are in the midst of a big shift,\" says Mrs Chilazi. Michelle Jolivet, author of Is DEI Dead?: The Rebranding of Inclusive Organizations, says she is worried that the anti-DEI movement will lead to progress stalling for historically disadvantaged groups. \"Things that matter are measured, and when you stop measuring them, they stop happening,\" she says. \"Then you do stop making progress.\" But as to the question at the centre of her book \u2013 is DEI dead? \u2013 Jolivet says the answer is no. The companies that appear to have cancelled their DEI programmes are not really eliminating them, she says. Instead, they are just rebranding and reorganising to escape potential lawsuits. She gave the example of Walmart renaming its chief diversity officer to chief belonging officer. Similarly, McDonald's gave one of its programmes a facelift, changing the name of its Global DEI Center of Excellence to the Global Inclusion Team. \"DEI has become more of a controversial word,\" she says. \"If I just take that word out, I can still do the same thing.\" But not everyone is reassured. Back in the fields of Union County, Elise Ashby looks towards the future with uncertainty. The grant from Walmart gave her access to capital that she argues black-owned businesses often struggle to obtain. She fears a return to when she \"stayed up nights\" wondering where the next cheque would come from and facing the kind of obstacles \"white men don't have\". She says: \"Am I concerned about the future? Absolutely.\" Additional reporting by Natalie Sherman Top image credit: Getty Images BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

Eyad Baba\/AFP via Getty Images                                       hide caption  TEL AVIV \u2014 Israel says that it is stopping the entry of all goods and supplies into the Gaza Strip, citing what it described as Hamas' refusal to accept a U.S. proposal to extend the first phase of the six-week-old ceasefire, and threatened \"further consequences.\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said President Trump's Middle East Special Envoy Steve Witkoff had proposed an extension of the first phase of the ceasefire with Hamas through Ramadan and Passover which could see the release of the remaining 59 Israeli hostages still held in Gaza. Ramadan began Friday night and ends March 29. Passover ends on April 19. The new proposal Israel has announced would have Hamas release half of the living and dead hostages at the start of the seven-week ceasefire period, and would secure the release of the remaining hostages by the end, if the two sides reach an agreement on a permanent end of the war. \"Israel will not allow a ceasefire without the release of our hostages,\" according to a statement from the prime minister's office. \"If Hamas continues its refusal, there will be further consequences.\" The statement did not elaborate on what consequences could follow, but said Israel had a U.S. commitment to allow it to resume the war if ceasefire negotiations were deemed ineffective. Hamas, in a statement, accused Netanyahu of trying to evade the framework of the ceasefire agreement that went into effect Jan. 19 after 15 months of conflict sparked by the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel. More than 48,000 Palestinians were killed in the conflict, according to Gaza health officials, and most of the buildings in the occupied Palestinian territory were either destroyed or damaged. The ceasefire was being implemented under three phases. Under the first phase, Palestinian Hamas militants released 33 Israeli hostages held in Gaza after being seized in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel that also killed around 1,200 Israelis. In exchange, Israel freed around 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The second phase of the ceasefire was set to begin Sunday, under the terms of the deal, and see the release of the 59 Israeli hostages still held in Gaza, 32 of whom are believed to be dead. It also aimed to secure a more permanent end to the conflict. But negotiations in Cairo last week failed to achieve any consensus on implementation of the second phase. Hamas accused Israel of a \"blatant attempt\" to evade the original agreement. \"Netanyahu's decision to stop humanitarian aid is cheap blackmail, a war crime and a blatant coup against the agreement. The mediators and the international community must move to pressure the occupation and stop its punitive and immoral measures against more than two million people in the Gaza Strip,\" Hamas said in a statement. Israel said that almost 21 thousand trucks of aid entered Gaza since the beginning of the ceasefire in January. Aid organizations estimated that almost the entire 2 million Palestnians living in Gaza depended on this life saving aid, and there were famine-like conditions in Gaza because such little aid was going in. After months of relying on canned goods, people in Gaza started to slowly find fresher vegetables, fruits, and frozen meats in the market. 40-year old Ibrahim Abu Sultan from Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza said that the influx of aid helped his family. \"Before the ceasefire, we would eat one meal every two or three days. Now we can at least have a meal a day,\" Abu Sultan said. The expiration of the first phase of the ceasefire coincided with the first day of Ramadan. It was the first Ramadan in Gaza not under Israeli bombardment since the beginning of the war. Videos posted online showed lights and decorations strung among the destruction of the buildings as people gathered to break the fast together among the rubble of their homes. Eli Sharabi, who was released from Gaza last month after 491 days in Hamas captivity, will meet with President Trump on Tuesday, Sharabi's brother, Sharon, told Israeli Channel 12. Trump megadonor Miriam Adelson, an Israeli-American, is flying the Sharabi family to Washington for the meeting, the released hostage's brother said. Eli Sharabi, who was abducted from his home in Kibbutz Be'eri on Oct. 7, 2023, detailed the harsh conditions of captivity in the first lengthy interview given by an Israeli freed in a recent round of hostage releases. In the interview with the Israeli television documentary program Uvda, Sharabi described his hands and legs being shackled for the entire duration of his captivity, most of which he spent in underground Hamas tunnels. He said he was held with three other hostages, and spoke of enduring extreme hunger and losing around 66 pounds while he was held hostage. Sharabi said when a Hamas operative discovered his family's home had been bombed by the Israeli military, he was severely beaten, suffering broken ribs that made it difficult for him to breathe for days. \"I didn't care about the beatings. They broke my ribs, but the hunger was worse. I just wanted them to give me half a pita,\" he said. \"Your stomach sticks to your back. You can literally see it caving in and can't believe it's happening to your body.\" He called on Israel to make all efforts to secure the release of all Israeli hostages as soon as possible. Sharabi's wife, two daughters and brother were killed in the Hamas-led attack Oct. 7, 2023. Itay Stern in Tel Aviv and Ahmed Abuhamda in Cairo contributed to this report.

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"Generally, barring a few bumps and bruises from inevitable potholes along the road, you expect your earnings: salary and other combined compensation, to go in one direction throughout your life. You offer more knowledge, skills, and experience to your role or trade, and it's only natural to expect increased compensation the more time you spend in a role. Plus there's this whole thing called inflation that makes a dollar effectively worth less over time, so while the cost of everything and just staying alive is increasing perpetually around you at least you can expect your wages to keep up with that\u2014right? Unfortunately, this isn't always the case, wages have a tendency to stagnate and fall behind market rates as long as you're staying with the same job. Meaning that it's usually going to be better to find a new job to get that bump in pay you're looking for. (There are, of course, exceptions to this as there are to any \"rule.\") Like what you see? Follow our WhatsApp channel for more. These new owners took things a step further, effectively more than halving this employee's take-home compensation when they took over the company where they worked two months after they started in their new role. Luckily, they were in a position where they were able to go and find another role reasonably quickly. This prompted them to share their experience with this online community, where they shared their experience and frustration with community members before asking them whether or not they should be giving notice to their job or not.

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"Software and security updates are the new displays, cameras, and batteries, as each phone maker looks for another way to differentiate its phones from the competition. The latest to join the crazy is Honor, who unveiled a new commitment to software and security updates during its AI strategy unveil today. Honor makes some of the more interesting phones on the market, and until the launch of the Oppo Find N5, its Magic V3 was the world\u2019s thinnest folding phone at just 4.4mm. Now, future folding phones and flagship devices will all get seven years of software and security updates. Here\u2019s which phones will get the updates and what it means for you. In essence, Honor\u2019s commitment is straightforward: seven years of security and software updates for flagship Honor Magic series phones. This is starting in the EU \u2014 unsurprising given that Honor phones aren\u2019t sold in the US \u2014 but it\u2019s unclear whether the commitment is just for EU buyers or a global commitment. The first phone covered by the commitment is the Honor Magic 7 Pro, although it\u2019s unclear whether any other existing devices will get the same support. The company says that in the future, it will offer the same support to other flagship devices, including both bar phones and folding phones. This essentially means that any Magic flagship device should get this support, but it\u2019s also unclear what will constitute a flagship device. There\u2019s also no commitment to a specific timeline for updating phones, although most companies fail to hit these stated timeliness goals as it relies on several different variables. You may be wondering, why does this even matter? And truth be told, for most people, it won\u2019t matter. However, as more consumers feel the pinch and smartphones become more expensive, there\u2019s a growing contingent of phone users who are opting to keep their phones for longer. In the UK, YouGov found that more than 55% of smartphone users want to keep using their phones for more than three years. In the US, analysis of trade-ins last year suggested that 33% of iPhone users and 22% of Android users had their phones for over three years, with the average lifetime of a device increasing to 3.7 years. Honor\u2019s commitment won\u2019t impact users in the US, but for those in the UK \u2014 and especially those buying very expensive folding phones \u2014 it provides some reassurance that their phone won\u2019t become obsolete, at least not for a few years. It\u2019s worth noting that this is for phones going forward, so devices like the Honor Magic V3 almost certainly won\u2019t get an increase from their current commitment of four years of Android software updates and five years of security updates. The new commitment is a healthy increase and also brings Honor in line with the competition. The biggest competition \u2014 or rather, the most globally available competitor \u2014 is Samsung. Recent devices like the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Galaxy S25 series all get seven years of software and security updates. Samsung first adopted this commitment last year with the Galaxy S24 series, so any devices launched before will likely get four years of software and five years of security updates. Honor\u2019s other big competitor is Oppo (and OnePlus, depending on the market). For the flagship Oppo Find N5 foldable, the company has committed to just four years of major OS updates and six years of security updates. The same update schedule applies to the OnePlus 13, which is further surprising given it is a flagship like the Magic 7 Pro and Galaxy S25 Ultra. Honor\u2019s commitment to updates also brings it in line with Google\u2019s Pixel 9 lineup, with the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold all getting seven years of guaranteed software and security updates. Today\u2019s commitment makes Honor only the third Android phone maker to commit to this update schedule, and while it\u2019s disappointing that existing devices apart from the Magic 7 Pro won\u2019t get the update, it makes future phones like the Honor Magic V4 more appealing. Google just rolled out its July security update for Pixel devices. While last month's Feature Drop added some cool features, like Gemini Nano on more devices, this month's update addresses a critical security vulnerability. So, if you have a Google Pixel device from the Pixel 5a and later with Android 14, make sure to update it as soon as possible. What\u2019s the critical security issue? It\u2019s known as CVE\u20132024\u201331320, which Google says, under certain conditions, allows third-party apps (\u201c3p\u201d) to bypass user prompts. If you have seen this happening on your Pixel device, then you should be aware that it\u2019s not a good thing to have. So make sure you grab the July security update ASAP. There's no doubt that 2024 has already been an exciting year for Android phones. Samsung wowed us with the Galaxy S24 series at the beginning of the year, the OnePlus 12 and 12R are two of the best phones available right now, and Google is expected to impress later this month with the Google Pixel 8a. But for the last few weeks, I haven't been thinking about any of those phones. Why? Because I've been using the Honor Magic 6 RSR. After launching in China this past March, the Magic 6 RSR is now available in the EU, and that's allowed more folks than ever to get their hands on the phone. And that's great, because the Honor Magic 6 RSR has quickly become my new favorite Android phone of 2024. It has some of 2024's best smartphone hardware Honor Magic 6 Ultimate teaser Honor Honor is teasing the launch of a new smartphone in its latest Magic series. After announcing the Honor Magic 6 Pro globally, the company is all set to unveil the Magic 6 Ultimate in China soon. The teaser showcases a new camera module design that is nothing like that of the Magic 6 Pro.

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"Lenovo continues experimenting with unique computing designs, bringing a new concept to Barcelona for Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2025. The brand has showcased a proof of concept called the ThinkBook Flip AI PC concept, which is essentially a 5-in-1 laptop, with five distinct display modes of function. Many are familiar with 2-in-1 devices, that function as a standard clamshell computer, and swivel on a 360-hinge to stand in an easel style, for reading, creativity, and productivity functions. However, the ThinkBook Flip AI PC takes advantage of several of Lenovo\u2019s developments over recent years, including foldable and rollable technologies. The device includes a dual hinge feature that supports the five usage modes\u2013 and can be used for display optimization, productivity, multitasking, and collaboration. The device can take on a standard clamshell mode, with a 13.1-inch 16:10 OLED display. It can then extend up into a vertical mode, with an 18.1-inch 2000 x 2664 resolution 3:4 OLED display. The third share mode folds outward with the panel 13.1-inches and the outer panel 12.9 inches, dual 16:10 aspect ratio, enabling multiple users to access the device. In read mode, the outer display panel folds flat against the device cover, with a 12.8-inch 2000 x 1258 16:10 display. The device is closed in tablet mode, leaving only the folded panel visible, with a 12.9-inch 2000 x 1258 16:10 display. Lenovo said the ThinkBook Flip Al PC is intended to provide \u201cAI-enhanced workflows and dynamic work environments\u201d and eliminate \u201cthe need for external monitors.\u201d Hardware on the ThinkBook Flip AI PC includes the Intel Core Ultra 7 processors, 32GB LPDDR5x memory, and PCIe SSD Storage, in addition to Thunderbolt 4 ports and a fingerprint reader. The device has 11.3 x 8.2 x 0.7 dimensions and weighs 3.1 lbs. The device is also one of Lenovo\u2019s Copilot+PCs, making its AI functionalities built-in. The ThinkBook Flip AI PC takes inspiration from former concepts turned products, including the ThinkPad X1 Fold series and the rollable ThinkBook Plus Gen 6, the latter of which is scheduled to release in June. While there is no word on whether this is a product that could ever come to market, Lenovo is a brand that enjoys showcasing concepts in general. The brand demonstrated its futuristic transparent display laptop during WMC in 2024. It also showcased its voice-controlled Auto Twist AI PC during IFA 2024. Intel has just announced that it's working on a new foldable display spec that may open the door to a whole new level of computing. The company believes that the first foldable laptops are not far off and may hit the market as soon as later this year. Lenovo is refreshing the ThinkPad P1 lineup with some much-needed features for hybrid workforces and enterprise users in need of high-end workstations. The ThinkPad P1 Gen 4 is getting a full HD webcam, a new display, plus options for Nvidia RTX graphics. Meanwhile, the ThinkPad P15 and ThinkPad P17 are getting a power boost under the hood with Intel\u2019s latest processors. Nvidia has unveiled a new model which could form the foundation of future humanoid robotics projects, representing a step forward toward a reality of generalist robots. The Nvidia Isaac Groot N1 model is open source and fully customizable for various robotics uses, inspired by the way that humans think. It consists of two systems, one of which is fast-reacting, similar to human reflexes, while the other is slower-thinking for careful decision making.

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"ByJohn Tamny  ByJohn Tamny , Contributor.  WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 18: Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks during a news ... [+] conference following the September meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee at the William McChesney Martin Jr. Federal Reserve Board Building on September 18, 2024 in Washington, DC. The Federal Reserve announced today that they will cut the central bank\u2019s benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to a new range of 4.75%-5%. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker\/Getty Images) The economic consensus of the moment is that higher prices are the same as inflation, and the Fed is the only governmental entity situated to bring down higher prices. It\u2019s a dangerous consensus. Prices are how a market economy organizes itself. Forget for now that the Fed is not remotely capable of bending the markets to its will, and instead let\u2019s think about what kind of tangle we\u2019re getting ourselves into if we say inflation is higher market prices, or a higher basket of prices of the government\u2019s choosing, only to tell the Fed to bring \u201cinflation\" down. It\u2019s tantamount to economists and pundits ascribing to government the power to distort market signals, and by extension, the market economy. No thanks, not to mention that higher prices are not necessarily evidence of inflation as is. Please read on. Unless economics is no longer about tradeoffs, all rising market prices pre-suppose falling prices. If you\u2019re spending much more on eggs, by definition you have fewer dollars for other goods. Which is yet again a hint that prices go up and down for all sorts of reasons that have nothing to with inflation along with deflation. Think eggs yet again. Supposedly avian flu looms large in the price surge. If that\u2019s \u201cinflation,\u201d should the Fed fight it? Hopefully the question exposes the folly of today\u2019s consensus. Conversely, the price of flat screen televisions continues to decline. Deflation? Not remotely. A falling price pre-supposes rising prices as new wants are reflected in the marketplace. Positive tradeoffs. The challenge once again is that economists and pundits are saying that higher prices are inflation, and only the Fed is situated to fix inflation. Except that the Fed can do nothing here. Not only are rising and falling prices most often not evidence of inflation or deflation as is, it\u2019s no insight to say that the only way to bring down prices is to increase the productivity related to the making of the market good, which is all about increasing the number of hands and machines at work in the creation of the good. The Fed is not equipped to do any of this, nor demand any of it. Which brings us to inflation. To say that rising prices cause the latter is like saying that suntans cause the sun to shine. Causation is being reversed. So, what is inflation? It\u2019s not too much money in circulation, nor is it too much money chasing too few goods. All exchange in a market economy is products for products, in which case the money that circulates in the greatest quantity is logically the most trusted money; as in the monetary units least prone to devaluation by monetary authorities. As for inflation allegedly being too much money chasing too few goods, such a definition suggests devalued money actually rises in circulation as producers seek equal value for what they bring to market. See above to see the folly of the inflation definition. Inflation is a shrinkage of the unit of measure. Nothing else. The only problem is that when inflation allegedly reared its ugly head in 2021-22, the dollar was mostly stable in the constant that is gold. And if gold is too low rent to be considered, the dollar during that same timeframe was rising against foreign currencies. Which is just a way of saying that if 2021-22 was inflation, it was the first in the history of mankind during which the unit of measure (in our case, the dollar) didn\u2019t shrink. Which brings us back to where we were: prices of a myriad of market goods undeniably rose in 2021-22, but the dollar wasn\u2019t falling then. Meaning there was no inflation as certain prices rose in concert with other market goods falling in price. Despite this, the accepted wisdom is that the Fed is uniquely situated to \u2013 yes \u2013 bring down market prices. Once again, what a dangerous consensus.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"     This Android-powered digital notebook has features galore, but it's certainly a standout for readers, notetakers and multitaskers alike.    CNET\u2019s expert staff reviews and rates dozens of new products and services each month, building on more than a quarter century of expertise. As an avid book collector and insufferable neat freak, I have a strict rule against marking up pages in my physical books. That's why the Onyx Boox Note Air4 C, a $500 digital notebook and annotation tool, offered an alluring alternative: Mark up e-books and PDFs as much as you want -- and in color. I was intrigued. But first, I had to figure out how to navigate it. Despite paper books being my preferred method of reading, my 2022 Amazon Kindle Paperwhite e-reader has become a constant travel companion. Yet Kindles are known for their intentional limitations; if you want to do much more than download and read books, you're out of luck (the Kindle Scribe being the exception). Which, of course, makes using the device pretty straightforward.\u00a0 The Boox Note Air4 C opens up a world of possibilities but also adds some complexity, given the plethora of onboard capabilities. Along with jotting down notes on a paper-like, 10.3-inch display, you can download all your favorite apps, thanks to Android 13 (my thoughts on whether this is necessary are forthcoming). You can also transfer files across your tablet, computer and phone and sync your notes to Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive or Onyx Cloud. The best part: No subscription is needed (take note, reMarkable).\u00a0 Overall, once you overcome a slight learning curve and adjustment period, the Note Air4 C is an impressive device that packs a range of customizable functions in a sleek, lightweight design. Here are my key takeaways. Writing on the Note Air4 C feels smooth and natural. Color is obviously what makes this E Ink tablet pop. The Note Air4 C features a 300 pixels-per-inch display for black-and-white content and 150ppi for color. There's a solid range of font and color options for marking up documents, which you can do using the accompanying pen. And although colors end up limited to softer hue across apps, that more subdued appearance ends up being easier on the eyes. In most cases, there's no need for the comparatively vibrant colors you'll find on a phone or iPad, but if you're looking at a photo or video, you'll undoubtedly notice the discrepancy (more on that later). Speaking of easy on the eyes, you can control not only the tablet's brightness but also how cool or warm the display's colors are. That can make late-night reading or writing in bright sunlight more seamless.\u00a0 The Note Air4 C's display and accompanying stylus offer an authentic paper-and-pen-like experience, and at just over 10 inches, the display replicates the approximate dimensions of a standard sheet of paper or notebook. Writing feels natural, and the pen glides effortlessly across the surface. The tablet is 5.8 millimeters thick and weighs 420 grams, making it easy to toss into a tote bag or backpack. (If you want to fit this in a purse, you'll need to reach for one of your larger options.)\u00a0 The pen attaches magnetically to the side of the tablet, though you'll want to use the accompanying case to ensure it stays secure. It's comfortable and easy to hold and use, and a cap keeps the tip from getting damaged. I do wish there was an eraser function at the other end, but that's more of a nice-to-have perk I can live without. The on-screen eraser function otherwise operates smoothly and can remove markings with a simple stroke, compared to the reMarkable Paper Pro's more granular approach, in which each area needs to be passed over. More critically, there isn't any noticeable lag when writing, which really helps to sell this as an alternative to traditional notebooks and paper.\u00a0 When jotting down notes, there's plenty of fun to be had when it comes to choosing different fonts, colors and brushstrokes. And being able to blend typed and handwritten text makes everything from filling out to-do lists to marking up recipes and PDFs more versatile.\u00a0 Another favorite functionality is split-screen mode, which makes tasks like jotting down ideas while reading and comparing documents easier. You can also drag the dividing bar to adjust how much of the screen each app takes up.\u00a0 And now, onto e-books. Perhaps the biggest learning curve was sorting out what the Note Air4 C can and can't do when it comes to reading and marking up e-books. The tablet has some preloaded books that can be accessed via the NeoReader, which allows for handwritten and typed annotations, highlights and zoom capabilities. But many of those books are, shall we say, vintage -- think Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. The good news is you can download books (and documents) and transfer them to the tablet using a USB or Boox Drop, which can then be accessed via the NeoReader. But unless you have a way to (legally) download said books, you'll have to make do with what's already on board the device or use a third-party reading app. I downloaded both Kindle and Libby, but because there's no native capability to leave handwritten annotations within those apps, they very much functioned the way they would on a phone or Kindle. For instance, I could still highlight text in my Kindle books, but that's a standard function I'd already have otherwise. You could use split-screen to display a notebook on one half of the device's screen and your book on the other, but I'm not sure that's as helpful as having the notes directly on the page.\u00a0 I did play around with the FreeMark tool, which, as the name suggests, lets you mark up any part of the tablet, from the home screen to a web page to a Kindle book. But those additions are simply saved as screenshots in the Gallery, which I suppose is better than nothing.\u00a0 Ultimately, when it comes to a digital reading experience, I'm more likely to reach for my smaller, lighter, more straightforward Kindle. But the ability to switch between notetaking and reading is still an admittedly handy capability if that's of interest.\u00a0 Access to a world of apps via the Google Play store is super handy; I particularly appreciated emailing and downloading documents and accessing all my Google Drive files. If you're taking notes and need to look something up, you can just pull up the on-device browser, all without switching gadgets. But I'm not sure there's a need for every app on here.\u00a0 Just for the heck of it, I downloaded TikTok, YouTube and Instagram, though I was under no illusions that an E Ink tablet would offer an ideal viewing option for these platforms. While the ability to access the apps is impressive, the actual experience is not. Videos lag, and colors are too muted to decipher everything being shown. Admittedly, I was impressed with its smooth navigation and scrolling, but that's not enough to justify using social media apps on a digital notebook.\u00a0 This display isn't the ideal way to scroll through social media. But it's neat to have the option if you want it. To mitigate lag and ghosting, the term for when traces of the previous page still appear on screen, the Note Air4 C features different refresh modes, including an HD display that's ideal for reading, a Balanced display for moving through documents, Fast Mode for browsing sites and an Ultrafast Display for playing videos. Those options can help optimize for different functions like reading or TikTok scrolling and make quite a difference. Still, I'd say if you're looking for a doomscroll reading break, it's best to reach for your phone.\u00a0 The Note Air4 C packs 6GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage and also features a microSD card slot for expandable memory. There's also a 3,700-mAh battery, which lasts through several days of regular use. There's a USB-C port, inconveniently on the left side of the device, meaning you'll need to remove the cover when it's time to charge. I also regret to inform you that while the device comes with a charging cable, it doesn't include a power brick -- a sign of the times.\u00a0 The Boox Note Air4 C is one of the most versatile E Ink tablets on the market today. It's made all the more colorful by the range of available writing and annotation tools. It has a long-lasting battery, a satisfying paper-like display and a natural-feeling stylus with no noticeable lag.\u00a0 The presence of Android 13 makes this a genuinely multipurpose tablet, though it has its fair share of strengths and weaknesses (TL;DR: do your social media doomscrolling somewhere else).\u00a0 While I appreciated the range of annotation capabilities across books and PDFs, I wish that extended more to third-party platforms like Kindle -- though I understand that's on them to enable. But with its limited preloaded library, unless you have means of (legally) securing PDFs of your favorite books, there's not much more you can do on the Note Air4 C from a reading standpoint that you couldn't do on a plain e-reader. That said, having the option to quickly hop between a novel to a digital notebook to a web browser -- or to enable split-screen mode and multitask -- is surely an impressive capability. Altogether, the Note Air4 C is a highly capable and customizable gadget for readers, notetakers and multitaskers alike, though to varying degrees, depending on the platform and task at hand.\u00a0","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"At MWC (Mobile World Conference) in Barcelona today, Lenovo revealed a proof of concept for \u201ca PC powered by the sun.\u201d The entire lid of the laptop has been decked out with a top-class solar panel capable of 24% conversion efficiency \u2014 which is as high as the best roof-top panels you can buy. According to Lenovo, 20 minutes in direct sunlight will power up to one hour of video playback on the PC, and even low-light conditions will allow enough power generation to sustain the laptop\u2019s battery charge while idling. The high efficiency is achieved through \u201cBack Contact Cell\u201d technology and an advanced tracking system that constantly adjusts the charger\u2019s settings to maximize energy-saving and stability. The most exciting part is that, aside from the distinctive solar panel grid pattern on the lid, you can\u2019t even distinguish this from a \u201cnormal\u201d laptop. It\u2019s just 15mm thick and weighs 1.22kg, making it the world\u2019s first ultraslim solar-powered PC. Its specs are also nothing to be disappointed about \u2014 Lenovo imagines this 12-inch laptop powered by Intel Core Ultra processors with up to 32GB of memory, 1TB of storage, and an OLED display. Other specs include a 50.2 Wh battery, a 2M IR camera, four speakers and microphones, and three USB-C ports. For customers interested in soaking up as much sun as possible, Lenovo also showed off a proof of concept for a portable solar panel kit and power bank. This little gadget would allow you to charge up a power bank by plugging in the USB-C solar panel and attaching it to a bag, tent, tree, or any other sunny place you spot. This could come in handy whenever you\u2019re using your Yoga Solar PC and don\u2019t want to go out and sit in direct sunlight yourself. Instead, you can take advantage by setting up your solar kit and collecting some energy for later. It would also make a great accessory for anyone who wants to join in on the solar-powered fun without buying a whole new PC. It\u2019s impossible to know at this point how much of the power a typical user gets through would be generated by the sun \u2014 but does it really matter? Any amount of solar-generated power is better than no solar-generated power, and with this prototype, it seems like Lenovo has managed to create a solar-powered PC without making any sacrifices to size, design, or specs. That makes me think there\u2019s no reason not to have solar panels in our PCs. That said, we don\u2019t know what the price of such a PC would be yet, and a high price point would definitely affect accessibility \u2014 for now. But the sooner we bring designs like this to the market, the sooner people will find ways to bring prices down. Here\u2019s hoping Lenovo makes this one a reality because I think solar-powered PCs would be a great direction for us to head in. Lenovo has unintentionally confirmed the existence of two new upcoming handheld gaming consoles. The company recently shared documentation for its new Legion Go USB-C Dock, where the brochure lists support for two new devices: the Legion Go Gen 2 and Legion Go Lite. This is not the first time there has been a mention of the Legion Go Lite. In May, Windows Central reported that Lenovo is working on a Lite version of the original Legion Go. It was suggested that this smaller 7-inch device would be powered by the same AMD Z1 series chipset and would feature certain refinements and a lower price tag. Lenovo has announced two new laptops in partnership with Intel. Yes, they feature the new Core Ultra Series 2 chips, but it\u2019s really the software that makes these laptops interesting. The laptops themselves are the ThinkPad X1 Carbon and Yoga Slim 7i, but they\u2019re both tagged with an additional name: Aura Edition Imagined with Intel. I\u2019m not sure what the name is supposed to connote, but laptops under this new line include a host of software features that were developed by Lenovo in partnership with Intel. The most exciting of these is Smart Share, which allows for quick photo sharing between your phone and laptop with nothing more than a tap. Bumping the side of the laptop lid with your iPhone or Android phone will automatically bring up a smart share window displaying the photos in your mobile device. You've never seen a laptop like this -- I guarantee it. At IFA 2024, Lenovo showed off what might be the most fascinating laptop of the year so far -- the Lenovo Auto Twist PC. It's just a proof of concept, but it introduces some really fun ideas into the world of laptops.

The sci-fi satire hit Bong\u2019s home market with an estimated $9M four-day start (which includes tomorrow\u2019s Independence Day holiday), scoring the biggest opening weekend of 2025 so far and the best for a Warner Bros movie since 2019, as well as Robert Pattinson\u2019s top Korea launch ever.  \tBong\u2019s first film since his multiple Oscar winner Parasite, Mickey 17 was the No. 1 draw for Korea audiences who gave it a 70% market share. The movie debuted on a non-traditional Friday, with the early play teeing up the global rollout this coming week which will include such majors as China, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, UK, Australia and all of Latin America, alongside North America.  \t            \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t \t              \tNews \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\t'Ne Zha 2' Overtakes 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' To Become No. 5 Highest-Grossing Movie Ever WW - International Box Office\t\t \t\t\t                \tNews \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\t'Novocaine' With $8M+ Leads Lowest-Grossing Weekend Of 2025 To Date - Sunday Box Office Update\t\t \t\t\t        \tThe Korea start came in higher than Dune: Part Two (+10%), Alien: Romulus (+33%), Furiosa (+64%), Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes (+129%) and Dune (+138%).     \t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t       \tAcross the FSS three-day of $7M, Mickey 17 grossed\u00a0$600K\u00a0in\u00a0Imax from just 27 screens for 9% of the nationwide total.  \tKeeping tabs on Chinese blockbuster\u00a0Ne Zha 2, it reached RMB 14.287B on Sunday in the home market, according to Maoyan estimates. Depending on the exchange rate conversion applied, that equates to anywhere from $1.962B to $1.984B solely in China. Combined with $18M from North America, that rises to $1.98B or $2.002B.

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"Honor has been pushing the boundaries of foldable phone hardware with the Magic V2 and Magic V3 in recent years. Its flagship Magic 7 Pro also outperforms the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra in a few ways. But hardware isn\u2019t the whole story when you\u2019re in the market for a new phone. Software plays a big part in buying decisions, and Honor finally seems to be working in that direction. At MWC 2025, the company announced a $10 billion Alpha Plan aimed at propelling it into the big leagues alongside Apple and Samsung. Honor wants to transition from a smartphone company to an \u201cAI device ecosystem company.\u201d This means you can expect more Honor products\u2014such as wearables, tablets, and laptops\u2014to launch globally, with better cross-device integration than ever. The company has announced deeper collaborations with Google Cloud and Qualcomm to help \u201crevolutionize human-to-device interaction\u201d with AI. Honor will invest $10 billion over the next five years in the Alpha Plan. For now, Honor has revealed only a couple of AI features focused on its promised human-to-device interaction. One demo showcased Honor\u2019s AI agent making a table reservation through a third-party service while considering traffic conditions and appointments saved in Honor Calendar. There\u2019s no specific rollout date yet, but it is expected to arrive in international markets \u201cin the near future.\u201d The Alpha Plan also includes a new imaging technology brand called AIMage, featuring an AI Upscale tool that can restore old portraits. It will launch this month for the Honor Magic 7 Pro and Magic 7 RSR. There\u2019s a new \u201call-ecosystem file-sharing technology,\u201d which can help you transfer data from Android to iOS and vice versa. Like Oppo\u2019s O+ Connect for data transfer between iOS and Android, you\u2019ll need to install the Honor Connect app on your iPhone to use this feature. Honor\u2019s AI deepfake detection will also \u201csoon arrive\u201d on its latest flagship bar phones and foldable devices. A focus on cross-device integration, along with seven years of Android OS upgrades, makes Honor\u2019s approach sound a lot like Samsung\u2019s and Apple\u2019s, both of which already have well-established ecosystems. From my experience, Honor\u2019s current cross-device integration isn\u2019t bad, but its design needs an overhaul to feel more modern. The collaborations with Google Cloud and Qualcomm are promising\u2014Honor\u2019s hardware has been top-notch for years, but its software has lagged behind. The Alpha Plan collaborations could help bridge that gap for the better. You may be disappointed if you hoped that Samsung would enhance the charging speed for its future foldable devices. Recently leaked certifications confirm that the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 will maintain the same wired charging speeds as their predecessors. According to China\u2019s 3C authority (via\u00a0Android Headlines), which recently certified both handsets, both phones are expected to retain a charging speed of 25W and\u00a0feature a dedicated Samsung EP-TA800 charger, which maxes out at 25W. The Google Pixel 9a is here and it has a brand new look, some new features, a tempting price, and a very tough time ahead of it. The curvy shape of the Google Pixel 8a has gone, replaced by a flat rear panel and flat sides. Not only that, but the iconic Pixel visor-style camera module has disappeared too, and the two cameras have been integrated into the back of the phone. That\u2019s right, there\u2019s no camera bump at all, making it look very unusual in 2025. Whether you already miss the best design Google has ever come up with on its phones will be down to your personal taste, but if you get the Pixel 9a in the right color, it\u2019ll still make a statement. Along with the ordinary Porcelain and Obsidian (white and black to you and me) models, there are two eye-catching versions: the purple Iris and the red-pink Peony. The Pixel 9a has an IP68 dust and water resistance rating, the rear is made from plastic, and the chassis is aluminum. There have been no end of rumours surrounding the iPhone 17 Air \u2013 or iPhone 17 Slim as it has also been called \u2013 and the latest adds some fuel to an existing fire. Previous reports have suggested the slimmer iPhone 17 model will feature a camera module that spans the width of the device, not too dissimilar from what Google offers on its Pixel 9 series though closer to the top of the phone.\u00a0 The most recent leak supports this idea, with Sonny Dickson sharing an image on X of what he claims is a first peek at a third party case for the iPhone 17 Air. Accompanying the image, Dickson said: \"Here\u2019s your first look at a case for the iPhone 17 Air. If you didn\u2019t know an Air was coming, you\u2019d swear it was a Google Pixel case.\" Upgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.","label":0}

FAQ - New Privacy Policy  Niles Investment Management founder and portfolio manager Dan Niles unpacks the outlook of the electric vehicle company on 'The Claman Countdown.' Tesla is recalling more than 376,000 of its Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles in the U.S. over a potential power steering issue. The recalled Model 3s and Model Ys could face a loss of power steering assistance \"when the vehicle reaches a stop and then accelerates again\" if they experience an \"overstress condition\" in the printed circuit board for electronic power-assisted steering (EPAS), Tesla said in a\u00a0recall report submitted last week to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Tesla cars parked at a dealership on May 31, 2024, in Corte Madera, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan\/Getty Images \/ Getty Images) All the potentially affected vehicles feature EPAS and used a software release prior to 2023.38.4, the report said. They belong to the model year 2023. \"A loss of power steering assist can require greater steering effort, especially at low speeds, increasing the risk of a crash,\" NHTSA said.\u00a0 HONDA RECALLS NEARLY 295K HONDA, ACURA VEHICLES FOR RISK OF ENGINE STALL, POWER LOSS Tesla said it designed the vehicles in a way that steering \"will not be affected\" if they suffer the \"overstress condition\" while driving above 0 miles per hour.\u00a0 \"Tesla\u2019s design avoids any unreasonable risk to safety by preventing a loss of EPAS while the vehicle is in motion,\" the automaker said\u00a0on its website. \"In addition, Tesla does not believe that loss of EPAS when the vehicle reaches 0 mph is an unreasonable risk to safety because manual steering remains available.\" Tesla Model 3 vehicles are shown for sale at a Tesla facility in Long Beach, California, on May 22, 2023. (REUTERS\/Mike Blake \/ Reuters Photos) Tesla said it decided to recall the affected vehicles in all markets to \"avoid confusion for our customers\" after a \"determination by regulator in a non-US market that loss of EPAS at 0 mph should be remedied through a recall.\" The automaker started deploying a free over-the-air software fix to address the issue that could cause the \"overstress condition\" in the printed circuit board in October 2023. It said in the report that 99% of U.S. affected Model 3 and Model Y cars had already received software release 2023.38.4 or later as of Jan. 23 of this year. OVER 80,000 KIA ELECTRIC, HYBRID VEHICLES RECALLED OVER ISSUES WITH AIRBAGS: NHTSA The problem has not caused any known injuries, deaths or crashes. Owners of the recalled EVs will not need to take their vehicle to a dealership, according to the report. They can expect to receive notification about the recall in the mail late next month. A Tesla Model Y is seen on a Tesla car lot on May 31, 2023, in Austin, Texas. (Brandon Bell\/Getty Images \/ Getty Images) Tesla also applied the software remedy to vehicles in production starting in October 2023. The recalled Model 3 and Model Y vehicles were built between late February 2023 and Oct. 11 of that year, according to the report.

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"Business Insider Edition  With GameStop mania and the rise of Roaring Kitty now years in the past, there's a new crop of retail-trading icons helping everyday investors navigate the market and turn a profit.          Similar to trader Keith Gill \u2014 who became famous for riding (and livestreaming) GameStop stock higher in 2021 \u2014 popular investing personalities today operate under meme-like personas online.               Many of these retail influencers came up during the pandemic stock boom. Their presence has grown in recent years as activity on once-popular communal spaces like Reddit's WallStreetBets have become less prominent.               Here's what three popular market gurus told Business Insider about their journeys, how they connect with investing communities online, and what some of their favorite all-time trades are.               Zach Kleinwaks, a 27-year-old futures trader based in New York, said he had been trading for years before he became known as a small-time mentor in the space.               On his personal accounts \u2014 under the user name \"zachaustintrades\" \u2014 he has nearly 10,000 Instagram followers, while more than 29,000 users follow his TikTok posts. He regularly flags stocks and posts trading tips. Kleinwaks also shares his trades on Stock Dads, a company that offers members exclusive trading tips from mentors like him for about $1,500 a year, according to its website.               Kleinwaks began trading full-time in 2022, but he had been veering down that path long before then, he says, noting that he always had an entrepreneurial streak and longed to be his own boss.               \"I was always a hustler. I would sell things on eBay. I would do sports cards and stuff. I kind of just fell upon the concept and the idea of day trading before it was a big craze,\" he said.               During the pandemic, he became a mini-celebrity among his college baseball team, who knew his stock trades were successful and were keen to get his advice on what to buy next. He ended up creating a Discord server to share his trades quickly, and, as people spread the word to their friends and family, later monetized it.               Like the others, Kleinwaks does not see himself as the typical WallStreetBets-style trader, many of whom he believes are gambling based on \"uneducated hype.\"               Kleinwaks thinks demand for his tips has grown in recent years, partly because retailer traders are more interested in serious analysis.               \"My guess is it came somewhere around when people realized that their investing strategy can't simply be: every time GameStop or AMC drops, just buy. I think too many people got severely, severely burnt on those stocks,\" he said of the community.               Kleinwak says a call on Alibaba was among his favorite trades, and he sees a rebound ahead for Chinese stocks in general.               The trade involved the purchase of a call option on the stock in late January, before the stock rallied 40%.               In a matter of days, he made around $17,000 on that trade, according to statements he shared with BI.               Kevin Xu, a day trader in San Francisco, began to amass a small army of followers when he posted about his stock trades on WallStreetBets during the pandemic.               Nowadays, Xu still shares his trades, but on AfterHour, a \"social copy trading\" platform he launched several years ago. It allows users to share their portfolios and post about their stock trade ideas. Today, his portfolio is worth around $8.6 million, according to data from the app.               Xu, who has minimal social media presence outside the app, has 174,000 AfterHour users following his moves. On r\/TheRaceTo10Million, a subreddit he created for those who aspire to make $10 million through trading, there are 347,000 members trying to emulate his success.               Despite the following he's earned, Xu insists he's an \"accidental\" trader. He began swing trading \u2014 a strategy where traders buy assets with the hopes of profiting on short-term market moves \u2014 in 2020, using $35,000 he received as a bonus at work.               Xu doesn't have a clear answer as to why he \"YOLO'ed\" the money into stocks. Originally, he wanted to use the money to purchase a car, he told BI, but missed the deadline to request his bonus in cash.               \"I've always wanted more. I think I had an epiphany in my twenties that you kind of have to take risks to make that quantum leap in your life, a calculated risk, right?\" he said.               It was a rush for Xu to post about his gains online. He became quickly immersed in the community of WallStreetBets, he said, reading every comment and posting on a regular basis. Part of him was amazed by how casually everyone was talking about their finances on the subreddit. Part of him, he admits, also liked the attention.               \"I think the highest order of posting online is being right,\" he said. \"It is a social status. It's validation. It's bragging rights, right?\"               Xu, though, has since put some distance between himself and the WallStreetBets community. Unlike others on the platform, he says his strategy involves studying technical signals, volume spikes, short-term interest in a stock, and other indicators until he develops a thesis about a particular company. Then, he goes \"all-in\" on the trade.               \"I believe in high conviction,\" he told BI. \"I believe in only one or two stocks at a time.\"               Xu also hasn't posted on WallStreetBets in years, despite being one of the community's most regular posters during the pandemic. In his view, the subreddit has deteriorated into a \"glorified Instagram meme page.\"               \"I think what people are hungry for right now is where do I go to find and learn about what's hot in the market right now? What people are trading, why people are trading it,\" he said.               One of Xu's top trades of all time was a bet on shares of Norwegian Cruise Line, he told BI. After buying the stock at a low point in 2020, he made over $448,000 on the trade, according to a post he made on Reddit in 2021.               Offline, Vaughn McNair \u2014 a 31-year-old trader based in Illinois \u2014 is a husband and a father of three. Online, he goes by \"Grandmaster Obi,\" and he promotes his trading ideas to followers on his Discord server and on his YouTube channel.               McNair has around 10,000 members tuning into his trading tips on Discord, and around 40,000 subscribers on YouTube. Many of them regard McNair's tips with sage-like importance, and frequently thank him for his advice and sprinkle diamond emojis in the comments section of his videos, referring to \"diamond hands,\" or traders who have a strong conviction in a certain trade and who resist selling even in tough times.               Learning how to invest was a long process of trial and error. McNair, who began day trading when he was 16, said he's lost as much as $14,000 in a single day from a bad trade.               McNair has become a better trader over time, more aware of preserving his nest egg and hedging his bets so he can avoid slipping into the red. Now, he works as a full-time trader, which involves waking up at the crack of dawn to assess the pre-market moves and spending up to 12 hours a day trading and analyzing charts.               \"Now my focus on each trade is just not to lose any money. It doesn't matter how much money I make, as long as I don't lose any,\" he said.               McNair isn't one to relish the attention. He describes himself as a shy person, and said he began broadcasting his trades on YouTube partly to get out of his comfort zone.               At times, he finds the job stressful, he said, due to how demanding his followers can be to get in on the hottest trade.               \"When I alert a stock, actually, that's when the stress comes,\" he said.               During the pandemic, he was a moderator on WallStreetBets, but left the subreddit when Keith Gill, the trader known as Roaring Kitty, was hit with several lawsuits.               McNair said being involved in the community became too much for him. While his followers frequently liken him to Gill, he resists the comparison to a Roaring Kitty-type influencer, as he believes his trading strategy is more serious than picking meme stocks.               McNair's favorite stock at the moment is Palantir. Previously, he made a successful call when he shouted out the company as a \"top buy\" in a YouTube video on December 2. Shares went on to soar as much as 62% before retreating in recent weeks, and are still up about 28% since McNair's post.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"It\u2019s no secret that solid-state batteries have the potential to be the next big thing in the electric vehicle industry, but their mass-market adoption has been dragged down by reliability concerns. That hasn\u2019t stopped carmakers from carrying out more research on the technology, though. And Mercedes-Benz is at the very pinnacle of that effort. The German giant is already testing its own solid-state batteries for its EVs with a range of over 620 miles (1,000 km) on a single charge. The new battery technology, which promises increased driving range, quicker charging, and efficiency, is being developed by the carmaker in collaboration with US-based Factorial Energy. Mercedes\u2019 first production car to employ such a battery will likely be rolled out by the end of the decade. The battery was tested by Mercedes on an EQS sedan in the UK, with minor adjustments to make room for the larger pack primarily involving rebuilding the battery housing. In the prototype, Mercedes-Benz's Formula 1 engineers in Brixworth built pneumatic actuators for a floating cell carrier inside the enclosure. This mechanism controls how the materials inside the battery cells expand and contract during charging and discharging \u2013 for increased stability and longevity. Mercedes stated that the 12-module battery housing of the EQS was versatile enough for various configurations, even though its full specifications are still pending confirmation. Mercedes estimates a 25% increase in driving range with the new battery. The EQS prototype is currently a 450+ saloon with up to a range of 511 WLTP miles (822 km) suggesting a real-time driving range of more than 620 miles when the EV finally comes out. The current EQS 450+, for comparison, is powered by a 118-kWh Li-ion battery with a range of 352 miles (566 km). But if solid-state batteries are so great, why are they not already being used? The main reason is because of their propensity to crack as they expand and contract during a charging cycle. This results in dendrites, which may lead to battery short circuits. Because of this, lithium-ion batteries continue to be the most dependable, long-term option for EV powering \u2013 at least as of now. But in the case of Factorial\u2019s battery, there\u2019s a solid electrolyte based on sulfide that makes its solid-state battery safer and more effective. Mercedes-Benz is also making headway on the development of new-generation silicon carbide inverters and power electronics in addition to the new battery technology. They are now being developed at AMG High-Performance Powertrain in Brixworth to improve performance and power efficiency for the company's upcoming vehicles. It was last year that Factorial delivered the first solid-state battery cells based on its proprietary FEST (Factorial Electrolyte System Technology). Then, in September 2024, Mercedes and Factorial went on to introduce the more sophisticated all-solid-state Solstice battery. As per Factorial, the new Solstice battery is projected to offer 80% more driving range than existing lithium-ion batteries thanks to its \"breakthrough\" energy density of 450 Wh\/kg. In comparison to traditional Li-ion batteries, these solid-state batteries can reduce the overall weight by 40%, according to Factorial. The Solstice, for example, weighs 580 lb (263 kg), which is 33% less than a typical 90-kWh battery. Factorial celebrated a significant accomplishment in December last year when its Solstice all-solid-state battery cells reached a 40-Ah capacity. The company is also collaborating with other significant automakers, such as Hyundai and Stellantis, to further develop solid-state battery technology. Given that Honda has already made its pilot production line public in November of last year, the next few months are going to be crucial for solid-state battery tech. Hyundai plans to launch a demonstration line of all-solid-state EV batteries in March. A fleet of electric Dodge Chargers that run on Factorial's solid-state batteries will be introduced by Stellantis in 2026, the company recently stated. Also, keep in mind that BYD and CATL, the two biggest EV battery manufacturers in China, are also vying to launch their own set of solid-state batteries. As the race for battery technology hots up, it will be interesting to see what the EV naysayers will have to say. Battery range has always been one of the biggest reasons for skeptics to stay away from EVs. Who knows, a 500+ mile real-world range battery might just be a nail in the coffin for ICE vehicles.

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"With a market flooded with options, it can be daunting finding an electric bike that meets modest demands \u2013 like commuting to work or getting out and about on the weekend \u2013 that also comes with an equally modest price tag. But this superb number ticks both boxes, and then some. The C11 Pro ebike hails from Fiido, a Chinese company known for its quality \"budget\" electric bicycles, cargo bikes, off-road rides, foldable models and scooters. It's also garnered a reputation for delivering its versatile two-wheelers in stylish packages. And the sleek C11 Pro is no exception. While \"quality\" and \"budget\" seem contradictory, you get both with this one. Anyone new to the ebike world \u2013 like me \u2013 will be happy to know that if the C11 Pro is delivered in a flat-pack to your doorstep, it's a breeze to assemble, even if you've never done more than pump air into tires before. No extra tools are needed and the finished product feels incredibly sturdy, which is obviously very important if you're going to be flying down the road on it at speed. The seat height and handlebar tilt are also easy to adjust if you need to change things up after you test it out for the first time. Some of the assembly can be tricky, however, even with the ample videos and other tutorials provided by Fiido. The hardest part, personally, was aligning the plastic front and rear fenders so they didn't touch the tires. This appears to be due to the position of the pre-drilled holes \u2013 which is unlikely to be something experienced by everyone, but if you're unlucky then you might need to play around with them to get it right. Fiido has listened to feedback from riders of its earlier models and designed the C11 Pro with a 500-Wh removable battery that can cover an estimated 56 miles (90 km) on the lowest pedal-assist setting, and 31 miles (50 km) in throttle-only mode (depending on the usual variables such as rider weight and terrain). The battery powers the rear-hub motor that delivers 55 Nm (40.5 lb.ft) of torque, while hydraulic disc brakes give the rider easy control over the bike at any speed.  While it's designed for urban commuting, the C11 Pro's suspension fork accommodates for rough roads or bike-path bumps, and overall the ride on any speed setting is smoother than what you'd get from a non-motorized city bike (and the comfortable Velo saddle also helps here). Fiido has also paid attention to a rider's need for customizing their bike, so the C11 Pro comes with a sturdy rear rack and options to attach a basket to the front. However, the bike is only available in one frame size \u2013 so while the handlebars and seat are, of course, adjustable, the step-through frame may not suit everyone. Though if you're between 5.16 and 6 ft (1.57 - 1.82 m), you're in luck. Elsewhere, you'll find a backlit LCD display that offers real-time metrics like speed, distance ridden and how much juice is left in the battery. There's also a USB port to charge a cellphone or other devices, and Bluetooth capabilities that link up with Fiido's smartphone and watch apps, which gather more data such as health monitoring and performance tracking. And handy for newcomers to ebikes, there's also a cadence sensor that helps riders find a sweet spot when it comes to pedal rotations per minute (RPM). This may not be of use to seasoned ebike owners, but is quite handy when you're just getting the feel for battery-assisted riding. Fiido has also built in some security measures to prevent theft \u2013 and, let's face it, this sparkly teal bike looks anything but \"budget\" \u2013 with a key-operated lock as well as enabling riders to secure it via the app. If somehow the C11 Pro does go missing, you can also track its location. The 700C x 25-mm (27.5 x 2.60-inch) tires are great for the bike's purpose \u2013 sealed road and path riding \u2013 and its seven-speed Shimano gear system adds plenty of versatility for hills and how much pedal effort you want to put in. Those modes are pretty simple to switch between, much like shifting gears, once you get a hang of the controls. A minor downside is having to cycle through each mode setting, but it's certainly not a major gripe. As for speed, the C11 Pro provides pedal-assist to around 25 mph (40 km\/h) when unlocked. The rider can unlock the speed limiter via the LCD panel, but obviously it's in place to restrict the bike to maximum speeds set by regional regulations. So you'll need to set the speed to comply with local laws. Weight-wise, the bike has a net weight of around 54 lb (24.5 kg), or about 46 lb (21.12 kg) without the battery in place. The battery itself is easy to remove and snap back in place, and it will take about six hours to reach capacity with the 2A charger provided. If you upgrade to a 3A charger, you can save about an hour here.  There are also a bunch of extras \u2013 mirror, phone holder etc. \u2013 you can add on when ordering the C11 Pro, but the basic model does come equipped with a front and rear LED light. The headlight is all you'll need for comfortable night riding, and the rear light will also activate when decelerating, which is handy when riding in traffic. Overall, the C11 Pro is an adept and well-featured city bike ideal for urban travel, all for under US$1,000 (it's currently discounted in the US for $899), and it comes with a two-year warranty and free shipping. There's also a 30-day return policy if it doesn't live up to expectations \u2013 though we think it will. If you're not in the US, Fiido has regional retailers elsewhere, including ones in the UK and Australia. Fiido has excelled at providing great-looking ebikes for people who have said they'll never get an ebike (guilty). Now, I don't think I can ever go back to my trusty human-powered steed.

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"It\u2019s been a long time coming, but the trust in Firefox and its mother organization, Mozilla, seems to be mostly gone, after a recent commit on the source code removed the \u201cwe don\u2019t sell your data\u201d promise, along with a change of Privacy notice and Terms of Use. You can see the changes in this commit.  It\u2019s been something like 10 years that Mozilla is no stranger to doing shady things and playing a double game with its users, one one hand pretending in its PR to be a \u201cchampion of privacy\u201d, and at the same time deploying tracking services without asking its end users (the famous studies). I have seen multiple times privacy settings being reset to collect data when updating the browser. Adding you sponsored links by default, and all that kind of things.  At the same time, Firefox has lost a huge amount of market share over the years (most of it going to Google Chrome), and its presence on the desktop is now just a blip of what it used to be:  Well, it was a good time to ask people what was their level of trust in Mozilla when it came to respecting their users. Most of our surveys get between 100 and 200 answers. This one skyrocketed to more than 700 hundred (thanks to numerous boosters on the Fediverse). And the result is unsurprising: For background, a lot of our followers are Firefox users, so this is likely to be somewhat representative of our of the core audience of Firefox. And it looks like trust has been completely shattered, with more than a third of respondents having no faith in Mozilla anymore, and the majority (54%) having serious doubts. When people are on the fence, it could go either way (losing trust, or regaining trust), but even if only half of these respondents end up not trusting Mozilla, this is a devastating blow. Following the backlash, Mozilla has tried to backpedal with a clarification. Unfortunately, the clarification confirms the initial fears. They are removing the mention of not selling data because of a wider meaning associated to the word selling in certain jurisdictions, such as in California: We never sell your data\u201d is because, in some places, the LEGAL definition of \u201csale of data\u201d is broad and evolving. As an example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) defines \u201csale\u201d as the \u201cselling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer\u2019s personal information by [a] business to another business or a third party\u201d in exchange for \u201cmonetary\u201d or \u201cother valuable consideration.\u201d Well, if that\u2019s what Mozilla is doing, then yes, it is clearly what most people would understand as selling your data, as in making some kind of profit or revenue from what they collect. Now the talk is all about alternatives, and those of you who are looking for your next browser, here are some things you can consider. As you will see, you do not lack options. A hardened fork of Firefox, LibreWolf takes Firefox\u2019s base (ESR) and dials up the privacy settings while removing telemetry and other potential leaks. It is pre-configured with strict anti-tracking, no telemetry, and uBlock Origin (an ad blocker) included out of the box. Site: https:\/\/librewolf.net\/ Waterfox is an open-source browser forked from Firefox (ESR), originally created by Alex Kontos in 2011 to optimize for 64-bit systems when Firefox lagged in that area. Over time, it evolved to emphasize privacy, speed, and user control. Unlike Librewolf, it does not ship with uBlock Origin under the hood, leaving you the freedom of installing your own extensions to maximize your privacy. Site: https:\/\/www.waterfox.net\/ Forked from Firefox, Zen Browser builds on the latest stable Firefox releases (not strictly ESR like some forks). It uses the Gecko engine with minimal changes to the core, focusing instead on enhancing the user interface and experience, with a radical approach to clean up Firefox\u2018s UI. Development started in April 2024, with its first public alpha in July 2024. It entered beta in December 2024, emphasizing a modern, visually appealing design. It\u2019s probably not your first choice if you are looking specifically for a focus on privacy, but let\u2019s keep it in this list anyway. Site: https:\/\/zen-browser.app\/ GNOME Web is the default browser for the GNOME desktop environment, built from the ground up by the GNOME project. It\u2019s a lightweight, open-source browser that uses WebKitGTK (a WebKit port for Linux) as its rendering engine, unlike Firefox\u2019s Gecko or Chromium\u2019s Blink. Its focus is simplicity, integration with GNOME, and a clean browsing experience, with some privacy considerations baked in (no telemetry and some tracking protection). However, since it is not based on any of the major browsers, you don\u2019t get to access something like uBlock Origin, so this may be something to factor in. Site: https:\/\/apps.gnome.org\/Epiphany\/ This is a stripped-down version of Chromium that removes all Google-related services, telemetry, and dependencies while keeping the browser functional. No Google tracking, no built-in data collection, and enhanced control over what the browser can access. It\u2019s barebones and relies on you to configure it. Site: https:\/\/github.com\/ungoogled-software\/ungoogled-chromium Another Firefox fork (based on ESR), maintained by the GNU Project, IceCat focuses on free software purity and privacy. It also blocks trackers by default, disables proprietary plugins, and includes privacy extensions like HTTPS Everywhere and LibreJS (which checks for non-free JavaScript). It does not get as frequent updates as other browsers, but its development is still well alive with the latest version being released in January 2025. However it\u2019s not super easy to install, as they do not provide binaries for every distro out there, so you have to compile it. Even on Arch\u2019s AUR it seems that there will be problems to build it because of incompatibilities with clang and python. Site: https:\/\/www.gnu.org\/software\/gnuzilla\/ Pale Moon is an open-source web browser originally forked from an older version of Firefox (around 2011, based on Firefox 38 ESR). Developed by Moonchild Productions, it\u2019s designed to maintain a lightweight, customizable experience while sticking to the classic Firefox interface and Gecko engine (though heavily modified). It diverges from Firefox\u2019s modern direction, focusing on efficiency and user control rather than chasing the latest web trends. Site: https:\/\/www.palemoon.org\/ Brave is built on Chromium (the open-source base of Google Chrome) but strips out Google\u2019s tracking elements. It\u2019s designed with privacy and speed in mind, featuring a built-in ad blocker, tracker blocker, and script blocking. It follows the Mozilla Public License for all of its components. However it does integrate a system based on crypto tokens to reward the visits that you make to certain site creators, which is something you may want to avoid. Site: https:\/\/brave.com\/ Ladybird is a web browser project aiming to be a truly independent, user-focused alternative. It started as part of SerenityOS, a hobby operating system created by Andreas Kling in 2018, but forked into a standalone project in 2022. Unlike most modern browsers, Ladybird doesn\u2019t rely on existing engines like Blink (Chromium), WebKit (Safari), or Gecko (Firefox). Instead, it\u2019s building its own engine from scratch, called LibWeb, paired with a custom JavaScript engine, LibJS. The focus is on adhering to web standards, delivering good performance, stability, and security, all while prioritizing user privacy over monetization. It\u2019s in pre-alpha, targeting a usable alpha release in 2026, and is backed by the Ladybird Browser Initiative, a nonprofit funded by donations (e.g., from GitHub co-founder Chris Wanstrath and Shopify). So it\u2019s still early days, but it should become an interesting option to consider later in 2025 or next year. Site: https:\/\/ladybird.org\/ While there is some alarmism about the decadence of Mozilla and Firefox, ultimately good things will come out of it. Investments into other alternatives will increase (like Ladybird) and the void will be replaced by other incumbents, especially since Privacy protections and Ad-blockers are values that attract a certain following. This will lead into a more fragmented market place, which should ultimately lead to stronger standards.

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"How the sun rose on the Silicon Valley How the sun rose on the Silicon Valley IN 1948 THERE WERE seven thousand people in Grinnell, Iowa, including more than one who didn\u2019t dare take a drink in his own house without pulling the shades down first. It was against the law to sell liquor in Grinnell, but it was perfectly legal to drink it at home. So it wasn\u2019t that. It wasn\u2019t even that someone might look in through the window and disapprove. God knew Grinnell had more than its share of White Ribbon teetotalers, but by 1948 alcohol was hardly the mark of Cain it had once been. No, those timid souls with their fingers through the shade loops inside the white frame houses on Main Street and Park Street were thinking of something else altogether. They happened to live on land originally owned by the Congregational minister who had founded the town in 1854, Josiah Grinnell. Josiah Grinnell had sold off lots with covenants, in perpetuity, stating that anyone who allowed alcohol to be drunk on his property forfeited ownership. In perpetuity! In perpetuity was forever, and 1948 was not even a hundred years later. In 1948 there were people walking around Grinnell who had known Josiah Grinnell personally. They were getting old; Grinnell had died in 1891; but they were still walking around. So... why take a chance! The plain truth was, Grinnell had Middle West written all over it. It was squarely in the middle of Iowa\u2019s Midland corn belt, where people on the farms said \u201ccrawdad\u201d instead of crayfish and \u201cbarn lot\u201d instead of barnyard. Grinnell had been one of many Protestant religious communities established in the mid-nineteenth century after Iowa became a state and settlers from the East headed for the farmlands. The streets were lineal with white clapboard houses and elm trees, like a New England village. And today, in 1948, the hard-scrubbed Octagon Soap smell of nineteenth-century Protestantism still permeated the houses and Main Street as well. That was no small part of what people in the East thought of when they heard the term \u201cMiddle West.\u201d For thirty years writers such as Sherwood Anderson, Sinclair Lewis, and Carl Van Vechten had been prompting the most delicious sniggers with their portraits of the churchy, narrow-minded Middle West. The Iowa painter Grant Wood was thinking of farms like the ones around Grinnell when he did his famous painting American Gothic. Easterners recognized the grim, juiceless couple in Wood\u2019s picture right away. There were John Calvin\u2019s and John Knox\u2019s rectitude reigning in the sticks. In the fall of 1948 Harry Truman picked out Grinnell as one of the stops on his whistle-stop campaign tour, one of the hamlets where he could reach out to the little people, the average Americans of the heartland, the people untouched by the sophisticated opinion-makers of New York and Washington. Speaking from the rear platform of his railroad car, Truman said he would never forget Grinnell, because it was Grinnell College, the little Congregational academy over on Park Street, that had given him his first honorary degree. The President\u2019s fond recollection didn\u2019t cut much ice, as it turned out. The town had voted Republican in every presidential election since the first time Abraham Lincoln ran, in 1860, and wasn\u2019t about to change for Harry Truman. On the face of it, there you had Grinnell, Iowa, in 1948: a piece of mid-nineteenth-century American history frozen solid in the middle of the twentieth. It was one of the last towns in America that people back east would have figured to become the starting point of a bolt into the future that would create the very substructure, the electronic grid, of life in the year 2000 and beyond. On the other hand, it wouldn\u2019t have surprised Josiah Grinnell in the slightest. IT WAS IN THE SUMMER of 1948 that Grant Gale, a forty-five-year-old physics professor at Grinnell College, ran across an item in the newspaper concerning a former classmate of his at the University of Wisconsin named John Bardeen. Bardeen\u2019s father had been dean of medicine at Wisconsin, and Gale\u2019s wife Harriet\u2019s father had been dean of the engineering school, and so Bardeen and Harriet had grown up as fellow faculty brats, as the phrase went. Both Gale and Bardeen had majored in electrical engineering. Eventually Bardeen had taught physics at the University of Minnesota and had then left the academic world to work for Bell Laboratories, the telephone company\u2019s main research center, in Murray Hill, New Jersey. And now, according to the item, Bardeen and another engineer at Bell, Walter Brattain, had invented a novel little device they called a transistor. It was only an item, however; the invention of the transistor in 1948 did not create headlines. The transistor apparently performed the same function as the vacuum tube, which was an essential component of telephone relay systems and radios. Like the vacuum tube, the transistor could isolate a specific electrical signal, such as a radio wave, and amplify it. But the transistor did not require glass tubing, a vacuum, a plate, or a cathode. It was nothing more than two minute gold wires leading to a piece of processed germanium less than a sixteenth of an inch long, shaped like a tiny brick. Germanium, an element found in coal, was an insulator, not a conductor. But if the germanium was contaminated with impurities, it became a \u201csemiconductor.\u201d A vacuum tube was also a semiconductor; the vacuum itself, like the germanium, was an insulator. But as every owner of a portable radio knew, vacuum tubes drew a lot of current, required a warm-up interval before they would work, and then got very hot. A transistor eliminated all these problems and, on top of that, was about fifty times smaller than a vacuum tube. So far, however, it was impossible to mass-produce transistors, partly because the gold wires had to be made by hand and attached by hand two thousandths of an inch apart. But that was the telephone company\u2019s problem. Grant Gale wasn\u2019t interested in any present or future applications of the transistor in terms of products. He hoped the transistor might offer a way to study the flow of electrons through a solid (the germanium), a subject physicists had speculated about for decades. He thought it would be terrific to get some transistors for his physics department at Grinnell. So he wrote to Bardeen at Bell Laboratories. Just to make sure his request didn\u2019t get lost in the shuffle, he also wrote to the president of Bell Laboratories, Oliver Buckley. Buckley was from Sloane, Iowa, and happened to be a Grinnell graduate. So by the fall of 1948 Gale had obtained two of the first transistors ever made, and he presented the first academic instruction in solid-state electronics available anywhere in the world, for the benefit of the eighteen students majoring in physics at Grinnell College. One of Grant Gale\u2019s senior physics majors was a local boy named Robert Noyce, whom Gale had known for years. Bob and his brothers, Donald, Gaylord, and Ralph, lived just down Park Street and used to rake leaves, mow the lawn, baby-sit, and do other chores for the Gales. Lately Grant Gale had done more than his share of agonizing over Bob Noyce. Like his brothers, Bob was a bright student, but he had just been thrown out of school for a semester, and it had taken every bit of credit Gale had in the local favor bank, not only with other faculty members but also with the sheriff, to keep the boy from being expelled for good and stigmatized with a felony conviction. Bob Noyce\u2019s father, Ralph Sr., was a Congregational minister. Not only that, both of his grandfathers were Congregational ministers. But that hadn\u2019t helped at all. In an odd way, after the thing happened, the boy\u2019s clerical lineage had boomeranged on him. People were going around saying, \u201cWell, what do you expect from a preacher\u2019s son?\u201d It was as if people in Grinnell unconsciously agreed with Sherwood Anderson that underneath the righteousness the midwestern Protestant preachers urged upon them, and which they themselves professed to uphold, lived demons of weakness, perversion, and hypocrisy that would break loose sooner or later. No one denied that the Noyce boys were polite and proper in all outward appearances. They were all members of the Boy Scouts. They went to Sunday School and the main Sunday service at the First Congregational Church and were active in the church youth groups. They were pumped full of Congregationalism until it was spilling over. Their father, although a minister, was not the minister of the First Congregational Church. He was the associate superintendent of the Iowa Conference of Congregational Churches, whose headquarters were at the college. The original purpose of the college had been to provide a good academic Congregational education, and many of the graduates became teachers. The Conference was a coordinating council rather than a governing body, since a prime tenet of the Congregational Church, embedded in its name, was that each congregation was autonomous. Congregationalists rejected the very idea of a church hierarchy. A Congregational minister was not supposed to be a father or even a shepherd but, rather, a teacher. Each member of the congregation was supposed to internalize the moral precepts of the church and be his own priest dealing directly with God. So the job of secretary of the Iowa Conference of Congregational Churches was anything but a position of power. It didn\u2019t pay much either. The Noyces didn\u2019t own their own house. They lived in a two-story white clapboard house that was owned by the church at Park Street and Tenth Avenue, at the college. Not having your own house didn\u2019t carry the social onus in Grinnell that it did in the East. There was no upper crust in Grinnell. There were no top people who kept the social score in such matters. Congregationalists rejected the idea of a social hierarchy as fiercely as they did the idea of a religious hierarchy. The Congregationalists, like the Presbyterians, Methodists, Baptists, and United Brethren, were Dissenting Protestants. They were direct offshoots of the Separatists, who had split off from the Church of England in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and settled New England. At bottom, their doctrine of the autonomous congregation was derived from their hatred of the British system of class and status, with its endless gradations, topped off by the Court and the aristocracy. Even as late as 1948 the typical small town of the Middle West, like Grinnell, had nothing approaching a country club set. There were subtle differences in status in Grinnell, as in any other place, and it was better to be rich than poor, but there were only two obvious social ranks: those who were devout, educated, and hardworking, and those who weren\u2019t. Genteel poverty did not doom one socially in Grinnell. Ostentation did. The Noyce boys worked at odd jobs to earn their pocket money. That was socially correct as well as useful. To have devoted the same time to taking tennis lessons or riding lessons would have been a gaffe in Grinnell.  Donald, the oldest of the four boys, had done brilliantly at the college and had just received his Ph.D. in chemistry at Columbia University and was about to join the faculty of the University of California at Berkeley. Gaylord, the second oldest, was teaching school in Turkey. Bob, who was a year younger than Gaylord, had done so well in science at Grinnell High School that Grant Gale had invited him to take the freshman physics course at the college during his high school senior year. He became one of Gale\u2019s star students and most tireless laboratory workers from that time on. Despite his apparent passion for the scientific grind, Bob Noyce turned out to be that much-vaunted creature, the well-rounded student. He was a trim, muscular boy, five feet eight, with thick dark brown hair, a strong jawline, and a long, broad nose that gave him a rugged appearance. He was the star diver on the college swimming team and won the Midwest Conference championship in 1947. He sang in choral groups, played the oboe, and was an actor with the college dramatic society. He also acted in a radio drama workshop at the college, along with his friend Peter Hackes and some others who were interested in broadcasting, and was the leading man in a soap opera that was broadcast over station WOI in Ames, Iowa. Perhaps Bob Noyce was a bit too well rounded for local tastes. There were people who still remembered the business with the box kite back in 1941, when he was thirteen. It had been harmless, but it could have been a disaster. Bob had come across some plans for the building of a box kite, a kite that could carry a person aloft, in the magazine Popular Science. So he and Gaylord made a frame of cross-braced pine and covered it with a bolt of muslin. They tried to get the thing up by running across a field and towing it with a rope, but that didn\u2019t work terribly well. Then they hauled it up on the roof of a barn, and Bob sat in the seat and Gaylord ran across the roof, pulling the kite, and Bob was lucky he didn\u2019t break his neck when he and the rig hit the ground. So then they tied it to the rear bumper of a neighbor\u2019s car. With the neighbor at the wheel, Bob rode the kite and managed to get about twelve feet off the ground and glide for thirty seconds or so and come down without wrecking himself or any citizen\u2019s house or livestock. Livestock ... yes. Livestock was a major capital asset in Grinnell, and livestock was at the heart of what happened in 1948. In May a group of Bob Noyce\u2019s friends in one of the dormitory houses at Grinnell decided to have a luau, and he was in on the planning. The Second World War had popularized the exotic ways of the South Pacific, so that in 1948 the luau was an up-to-the-minute social innovation. The centerpiece of a luau was a whole roasted suckling pig with an apple or a pineapple in its mouth. Bob Noyce, being strong and quick, was one of the two boys assigned to procure the pig. That night they sneaked onto a farm just outside of Grinnell and wrestled a twenty-five-pound suckling out of the pigpen and arrived back at the luau to great applause. Within a few hours the pig was crackling hot and had an apple in its mouth and looked good enough for seconds and thirds, which everybody helped himself to, and there was more applause. The next morning came the moral hangover. The two boys decided to go see the farmer, confess, and pay for the pig. They didn\u2019t quite understand how a college luau, starring his pig, would score on the laugh meter with a farmer in midland Iowa. In the state of Iowa, where the vast majority of people depended upon agriculture for a livelihood and upon Protestant morality for their standards, not even stealing a watermelon worth thirty-five cents was likely to be written off as a boyish prank. Stealing a pig was larceny. The farmer got the sheriff and insisted on bringing criminal charges. There was only so much that Ralph Noyce, the preacher with the preacher\u2019s son, could do. Grant Gale, on the other hand, was the calm, well-respected third party. He had two difficult tasks: to keep Bob out of jail and out of court and to keep the college administration from expelling him. There was never any hope at all of a mere slap on the wrist. The compromise Grant Gale helped work out\u2014a one-semester suspension\u2014was the best deal Bob could have hoped for realistically. The Night of the Luau Pig was quite a little scandal on the Grinnell Richter scale. So Gale was all the more impressed by the way Bob Noyce took it. The local deathray glowers never broke his confidence. All the Noyce boys had a profound and, to tell the truth, baffling confidence. Bob had a certain way of listening and staring. He would lower his head slightly and look up with a gaze that seemed to be about one hundred amperes. While he looked at you he never blinked and never swallowed. He absorbed everything you said and then answered very levelly in a soft baritone voice and often with a smile that showed off his terrific set of teeth. The stare, the voice, the smile\u2014it was all a bit like the movie persona of the most famous of all Grinnell College\u2019s alumni, Gary Cooper. With his strong face, his athlete\u2019s build, and the Gary Cooper manner, Bob Noyce projected what psychologists call the halo effect. People with the halo effect seem to know exactly what they\u2019re doing and, moreover, make you want to admire them for it. They make you see the halos over their heads.  Years later people would naturally wonder where Bob Noyce got his confidence. Many came to the conclusion it was as much from his mother, Harriett Norton Noyce, as from his father. She was a latter-day version of the sort of strong-willed, intelligent, New England\u2013style woman who had made such a difference during Iowa\u2019s pioneer days a hundred years before. His mother and father, with the help of Rowland Cross, who taught mathematics at Grinnell, arranged for Bob to take a job in the actuarial department of Equitable Life in New York City for the summer. He stayed on at the job during the fall semester, then came back to Grinnell at Christmas and rejoined the senior class in January as the second semester began. Gale was impressed by the aplomb with which the prodigal returned. In his first three years Bob had accumulated so many extra credits, it would take him only this final semester to graduate. He resumed college life, including the extracurricular activities, without skipping a beat. But more than that, Gale was gratified by the way Bob became involved with the new experimental device that was absorbing so much of Gale\u2019s own time: the transistor. Bob was not the only physics major interested in the transistor, but he was the one who seemed most curious about where this novel mechanism might lead. He went off to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in Cambridge, in the fall to begin his graduate work. When he brought up the subject of the transistor at MIT, even to faculty members, people just looked at him. Even those who had heard of it regarded it merely as a novelty fabricated by the telephone company. There was no course work involving transistors or the theory of solid-state electronics. His dissertation was a \u201cPhotoelectric Study of Surface States on Insulators,\u201d which was at best merely background for solid-state electronics. In this area MIT was far behind Grinnell College. For a good four years Grant Gale remained one of the few people Bob Noyce could compare notes with in this new field. Well, it had been a close one! What if Grant Gale hadn\u2019t gone to school with John Bardeen, and what if Oliver Buckley hadn\u2019t been a Grinnell alumnus? And what if Gale hadn\u2019t bothered to get in touch with the two of them after he read the little squib about the transistor in the newspaper? What if he hadn\u2019t gone to bat for Bob Noyce after the Night of the Luau Pig and the boy had been thrown out of college and that had been that? After all, if Bob hadn\u2019t been able to finish at Grinnell, he probably never would have been introduced to the transistor. He certainly wouldn\u2019t have come across it at MIT in 1948. Given what Bob Noyce did over the next twenty years, one couldn\u2019t help but wonder about the fortuitous chain of events. Fortuitous ... well! How Josiah Grinnell, up on the plains of Heaven, must have laughed over that! GRANT GALE WAS the first important physicist in Bob Noyce\u2019s career. The second was William Shockley. After their ambitions had collided one last time, and they had parted company, Noyce had concluded that he and Shockley were two very different people. But in many ways they were alike. For a start, they both had an amateur\u2019s hambone love of being onstage. At MIT Noyce had sung in choral groups. Early in the summer of 1953, after he had received his Ph.D., he went over to Tufts College to sing and act in a program of musicals presented by the college. The costume director was a girl named Elizabeth Bottomley, from Barrington, Rhode Island, who had just graduated from Tufts, majoring in English. They both enjoyed dramatics. Singing, acting, and skiing had become the pastimes Noyce enjoyed most. He had become almost as expert at skiing as he had been at diving. Noyce and Betty, as he called her, were married that fall. In 1953 the MIT faculty was just beginning to understand the implications of the transistor. But electronics firms were already eager to have graduate electrical engineers who could do research and development in the new field. Noyce was offered jobs by Bell Laboratories, IBM, RCA, and Philco. He went to work for Philco, in Philadelphia, because Philco was starting from near zero in semiconductor research and chances for rapid advancement seemed good. But Noyce was well aware that the most important work was still being done at Bell Laboratories, thanks in no small part to William Shockley. Shockley had devised the first theoretical framework for research into solid-state semiconductors as far back as 1939 and was in charge of the Bell Labs team that included John Bardeen and Walter Brattain. Shockley had also originated the \u201cjunction transistor,\u201d which turned the transistor from an exotic laboratory instrument into a workable item. By 1955 Shockley had left Bell and returned to Palo Alto, California, where he had grown up near Stanford University, to form his own company, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory, with start-up money provided by Arnold Beckman of Beckman Instruments. Shockley opened up shop in a glorified shed on South San Antonio Road in Mountain View, which was just south of Palo Alto. The building was made of concrete blocks with the rafters showing. Aside from clerical and maintenance personnel, practically all the employees were electrical engineers with doctorates. In a field this experimental there was nobody else worth hiring. Shockley began talking about \u201cmy Ph.D. production line.\u201d Meanwhile, Noyce was not finding Philco the golden opportunity he thought it would be. Philco wanted good enough transistors to stay in the game with GE and RCA, but it was not interested in putting money into the sort of avant-garde research Noyce had in mind. In 1956 he resigned from Philco and moved from Pennsylvania to California to join Shockley. The way he went about it was a classic example of the Noyce brand of confidence. By now he and his wife, Betty, had two children: Bill, who was two, and Penny, who was six months old. After a couple of telephone conversations with Shockley, Noyce put himself and Betty on a night flight from Philadelphia to San Francisco. They arrived in Palo Alto at six a.m. By noon Noyce had signed a contract to buy a house. That afternoon he went to Mountain View to see Shockley and ask for a job, projected the halo, and got it. The first months on Shockley\u2019s Ph.D. production line were exhilarating. It wasn\u2019t really a production line at all. Everything at this stage was research. Every day a dozen young Ph.D.s came to the shed at eight in the morning and began heating germanium and silicon, another common element, in kilns to temperatures ranging from 1,472 to 2,552 degrees Fahrenheit. They wore white lab coats, goggles, and work gloves. When they opened the kiln doors weird streaks of orange and white light went across their faces, and they put in the germanium or the silicon, along with specks of aluminum, phosphorus, boron, and arsenic. Contaminating the germanium or silicon with the aluminum, phosphorus, boron, and arsenic was called doping. Then they lowered a small mechanical column into the goo so that crystals formed on the bottom of the column, and they pulled the crystal out and tried get a grip on it with tweezers, and put it under microscopes and cut it with diamond cutters, among other things, into minute slices, wafers, chips\u2014there were no names in electronics for these tiny forms. The kilns cooked and bubbled away, doors opened, the pale apricot light streaked over the goggles, the tweezers and diamond cutters flashed, the white coats flapped, the Ph.D.s squinted through their microscopes, and Shockley moved between the tables conducting the arcane symphony. In pensive moments Shockley looked very much the scholar, with his roundish face, his roundish eyeglasses, and his receding hairline\u2014but Shockley was not a man locked in the pensive mode. He was an enthusiast, a raconteur, and a showman. At the outset his very personality was enough to keep everyone swept up in the great adventure. When he lectured, as he often did at colleges and before professional groups, he would walk up to the lectern and thank the master of ceremonies and say that the only more flattering introduction he had ever received was one he gave himself one night when the emcee didn\u2019t show up, whereupon\u2014bango\u2014a bouquet of red roses would pop up in his hand. Or he would walk up to the lectern and say that tonight he was getting into a hot subject, whereupon he would open up a book and\u2014whumpf!\u2014a puff of smoke would rise up out of the pages. Shockley was famous for his homely but shrewd examples. One day a student confessed to being puzzled by the concept of amplification, which was one of the prime functions of the transistor. Shockley told him: \u201cIf you take a bale of hay and tie it to the tail of a mule and then strike a match and set the bale of hay on fire, and if you then compare the energy expended shortly thereafter by the mule with the energy expended by yourself in the striking of the match, you will understand the concept of amplification.\u201d On November 1, 1956, Shockley arrived at the shed on South San Antonio Road beaming. Early that morning he had received a telephone call informing him that he had won the Nobel Prize for physics for the invention of the transistor; or, rather, that he was co-winner, along with John Bardeen and Walter Brattain. Shockley closed up shop and took everybody to a restaurant called Dinah\u2019s Shack over on El Camino Real, the road to San Francisco that had become Palo Alto\u2019s commercial strip. He treated his Ph.D. production line and all the other employees to a champagne breakfast. It seemed that Shockley\u2019s father was a mining engineer who spent years out on remote durango terrains, in Nevada, Manchuria\u2014all over the world. Shockley\u2019s mother was like Noyce\u2019s. She was an intelligent woman with a commanding will. The Shockleys were Unitarians, the Unitarian Church being an offshoot of the Congregational. Shockley Sr. was twenty years older than Shockley\u2019s mother and died when Shockley was seventeen. Shockley\u2019s mother was determined that her son would someday \u201cset the world on fire,\u201d as she once put it. And now he had done it. Shockley lifted a glass of champagne in Dinah\u2019s Shack, and it was as if it were a toast back across a lot of hard-wrought durango grit Octagon Soap sagebrush Dissenting Protestant years to his father\u2019s memory and his mother\u2019s determination. That had been a great day at Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. There weren\u2019t many more. Shockley was magnetic, he was a genius, and he was a great research director\u2014the best, in fact. His forte was breaking a problem down to first principles. With a few words and a few lines on a piece of paper he aimed any experiment in the right direction. When it came to comprehending the young engineers on his Ph.D. production line, however, he was not so terrific. It never seemed to occur to Shockley that his twelve highly educated elves just might happen to view themselves the same way he had always viewed himself: which is to say, as young geniuses capable of the sort of inventions Nobel Prizes were given for. One day Noyce came to Shockley with some new results he had found in the laboratory. Shockley picked up the telephone and called some former colleagues at Bell Labs to see if they sounded right. Shockley never even realized that Noyce had gone away from his desk seething. Then there was the business of the new management techniques. Now that he was an entrepreneur, Shockley came up with some new ways to run a company. Each one seemed to irritate the elves more than the one before. For a start, Shockley published their salaries. He posted them on a bulletin board. That way there would be no secrets. Then he started having the employees rate one another on a regular basis. These were so-called peer ratings, a device sometimes used in the military and seldom appreciated even there. Everybody regarded peer ratings as nothing more than popularity contests. But the real turning point was the lie detector. Shockley was convinced that someone in the shed was sabotaging the project. The work was running into inexplicable delays, but the money was running out on schedule. So he insisted that one employee roll up his sleeve and bare his chest and let the electrodes be attached and submit to a polygraph examination. No saboteur was ever found. There were also some technical differences of opinion. Shockley was interested in developing a so-called four-layer diode. Noyce and two of his fellow elves, Gordon Moore and Jean Hoerni, favored transistors. But at bottom it was dissatisfaction with the boss and the lure of entrepreneurship that led to what happened next. In the summer of 1957 Moore, Hoerni, and five other engineers\u2014but not Noyce\u2014got together and arrived at what became one of the primary business concepts of the young semiconductor industry. In this business, it dawned on them, capital assets in the traditional sense of plant, equipment, and raw materials counted for next to nothing. The only plant you needed was a shed big enough for the worktables. The only equipment you needed was some kilns, goggles, microscopes, tweezers, and diamond cutters. The materials, silicon and germanium, came from dirt and coal. Brainpower was the entire franchise. If the seven of them thought they could do the job better than Shockley, there was nothing to keep them from starting their own company. On that day was born the concept that would make the semiconductor business as wild as show business: defection capital. The seven defectors went to the Wall Street firm of Hayden Stone in search of start-up money. It was at this point that they realized they had to have someone serve as administrator. So they turned to Noyce, who was still with Shockley. None of them, including Noyce, had any administrative experience, but they all thought of Noyce as soon as the question came up. They didn\u2019t know exactly what they were looking for ... but Noyce was the one with the halo. He agreed to join them. He would continue to wear a white lab coat and goggles and do research. But he would also be the coordinator. Of the eight of them, he would be the one man who kept track, on a regular basis, of all sides of the operation. He was twenty-nine years old. Arthur Rock of Hayden Stone approached twenty-two firms before he finally hooked the defectors up with the Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporation of New York. Fairchild was owned by Sherman Fairchild, a bachelor bon vivant who lived in a futuristic town house on East Sixty-fifth Street in Manhattan. The house was in two sections connected by ramps. The ramps were fifty feet long in some cases, enclosed in glass so that you could go up and down the ramps in all weather and gaze upon the marble courtyard below. The place looked like something from out of the Crystal Palace of Ming in Flash Gordon. The ramps were for his Aunt May, who lived with him and was confined to a wheelchair and had even more Fairchild money than he did. The chief executive officer of Fairchild was John Carter, who had just come from the Corning Glass Company. He had been the youngest vice-president in the history of that old-line, family-owned firm. He was thirty-six. Fairchild Camera and Instrument gave the defectors the money to start up the new company, Fairchild Semiconductor, with the understanding that Fairchild Camera and Instrument would have the right to buy Fairchild Semiconductor for $3 million at any time within the next eight years. Shockley took the defections very hard. He seemed as much hurt as angered, and he was certainly angry enough. A friend of Shockley\u2019s said to Noyce\u2019s wife, Betty: \u201cYou must have known about this for quite some time. How on earth could you not tell me?\u201d That was a baffling remark, unless one regarded Shockley as the father of the transistor and the defectors as the children he had taken beneath his mantle of greatness. If so, one had a point. Years later, if anyone had drawn up a family tree for the semiconductor industry, practically every important branch would have led straight from Shockley\u2019s shed on South San Antonio Road. On the other hand, Noyce had been introduced to the transistor not by Shockley but by John Bardeen, via Grant Gale, and not in California but back in his own hometown, Grinnell, Iowa. For that matter, Josiah Grinnell had been a defector in his day, too, and there was no record that he had ever lost a night\u2019s sleep over it. NOYCE, GORDON MOORE, Jean Hoerni, and the other five defectors set up Fairchild Semiconductor in a two-story warehouse building some speculator had built out of tilt-up concrete slabs on Charleston Avenue in Mountain View, about twelve blocks from Shockley\u2019s operation. Mountain View was in the northern end of the Santa Clara Valley. In the business world the valley was known mainly for its apricot, pear, and plum orchards. From the work bays of the light-industry sheds that the speculators were beginning to build in the valley you could look out and see the raggedy little apricot trees they had never bothered to bulldoze after they bought the land from the farmers. A few well-known electronics firms were already in the valley: General Electric and IBM, as well as a company that had started up locally, Hewlett-Packard. Stanford University was encouraging engineering concerns to locate near Palo Alto and use the university\u2019s research facilities. The man who ran the program was a friend of Shockley\u2019s, Frederick E. Terman, whose father had originated the first scientific measurement of human intelligence, the Stanford-Binet IQ test. IBM had a facility in the valley that was devoted specifically to research rather than production. Both IBM and Hewlett-Packard were trying to develop a highly esoteric and colossally expensive new device, the electronic computer. Shockley had been the first entrepreneur to come to the area to make semiconductors. After the defections his operation never got off the ground. Here in the Santa Clara Valley, that left the field to Noyce and the others at Fairchild. Fairchild\u2019s start-up couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. By 1957 there was sufficient demand from manufacturers who merely wanted transistors instead of vacuum tubes, for use in radios and other machines, to justify the new operation. But it was also in 1957 that the Soviet Union launched Sputnik I. In the electronics industry the ensuing space race had the effect of coupling two new inventions\u2014the transistor and the computer\u2014and magnifying the importance of both. The first American electronic computer, known as ENIAC, had been developed by the Army during the Second World War, chiefly as a means of computing artillery and bomb trajectories. The machine was a monster. It was one hundred feet long and ten feet high and required eighteen thousand vacuum tubes. The tubes generated so much heat, the temperature in the room sometimes reached 120 degrees. What the government needed was small computers that could be installed in rockets to provide automatic onboard guidance. Substituting transistors for vacuum tubes was an obvious way to cut down on the size. After Sputnik I the glamorous words in the semiconductor business were computers and miniaturization. Other than Shockley Semiconductor, Fairchild was the only semiconductor company in the Santa Clara Valley, but Texas Instruments had entered the field in Dallas, as had Motorola in Phoenix and Transitron and Raytheon in the Boston area, where a new electronics industry was starting up as MIT finally began to comprehend the new technology. These firms were all racing to refine the production of transistors to the point where they might command the market. So far refinement had not been anybody\u2019s long suit. No tourist dropping by Fairchild, Texas Instruments, Motorola, or Transitron would have had the faintest notion he was looking in on the leading edge of the most advanced of all industries, electronics. The work bays, where the transistors were produced, looked like slightly sunnier versions of the garment sweatshops of San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown. Here were rows of women hunched over worktables, squinting through microscopes, doing the most tedious and frustrating sort of manual labor, cutting layers of silicon apart with diamond cutters, picking little rectangles of them up with tweezers, trying to attach wires to them, dropping them, rummaging around on the floor to find them again, swearing, muttering, climbing back up to their chairs, rubbing their eyes, squinting back through the microscopes, and driving themselves crazy some more. Depending on how well the silicon or germanium had been cooked and doped, anywhere from 50 to 90 percent of the transistors would turn out to be defective even after all that, and sometimes the good ones would be the ones that fell on the floor and got ruined. Even for a machine as simple as a radio the individual transistors had to be wired together, by hand, until you ended up with a little panel that looked like a road map of West Virginia. As for a computer\u2014the wires inside a computer were sheer spaghetti. Noyce had figured out a solution. But fabricating it was another matter. There was something primitive about cutting individual transistors out of sheets of silicon and then wiring them back together in various series. Why not put them all on a single piece of silicon without wires? The problem was that you would also have to carve, etch, coat, and otherwise fabricate the silicon to perform all the accompanying electrical functions as well, the functions ordinarily performed by insulators, rectifiers, resistors, and capacitors. You would have to create an entire electrical system, an entire circuit, on a little wafer or chip. Noyce realized that he was not the only engineer thinking along these lines, but he had never even heard of Jack Kilby. Kilby was a thirty-six-year-old engineer working for Texas Instruments in Dallas. In January 1959 Noyce made his first detailed notes about a complete solid-state circuit. A month later Texas Instruments announced that Jack Kilby had invented one. Kilby\u2019s integrated circuit, as the invention was called, was made of germanium. Six months later Noyce created a similar integrated circuit made of silicon and using a novel insulating process developed by Jean Hoerni. Noyce\u2019s silicon device turned out to be more efficient and more practical to produce than Kilby\u2019s and set the standard for the industry. So Noyce became known as the co-inventor of the integrated circuit. Nevertheless, Kilby had unquestionably been first. There was an ironic echo of Shockley here. Strictly speaking, Bardeen and Brattain, not Shockley, had invented the transistor, but Shockley wasn\u2019t bashful about being known as the co-inventor. And now, eleven years later, Noyce wasn\u2019t turning bashful, either. Noyce knew exactly what he possessed in this integrated circuit, or microchip, as the press would call it. Noyce knew that he had discovered the road to El Dorado. El Dorado was the vast, still-virgin terrain of electricity. Electricity was already so familiar a part of everyday life, only a few research engineers understood just how young and unexplored the terrain actually was. It had been only eighty years since Edison invented the light bulb in 1879. It had been less than fifty years since Lee De Forest, an inventor from Council Bluffs, Iowa, had invented the vacuum tube. The vacuum tube was based on the light bulb, but the vacuum tube opened up fields the light bulb did not even suggest: long-distance radio and telephone communication. Over the past ten years, since Bardeen and Brattain invented it in 1948, the transistor had become the modern replacement for the vacuum tube. And now came Kilby\u2019s and Noyce\u2019s integrated circuit. The integrated circuit was based on the transistor, but the integrated circuit opened up fields the transistor did not even suggest. The integrated circuit made it possible to create miniature computers, to put all the functions of the mighty ENIAC on a panel the size of a playing card. Thereby the integrated circuit opened up every field of engineering imaginable, from voyages to the moon to robots, and many fields that had never been imagined, such as electronic guidance counseling. It opened up so many fields that no one could even come up with a single name to include them all. \u201cThe second industrial revolution,\u201d \u201cthe age of the computer,\u201d \u201cthe microchip universe,\u201d \u201cthe electronic grid\u201d\u2014none of them, not even the handy neologism \u201chigh tech,\u201d could encompass all the implications. The importance of the integrated circuit was certainly not lost on John Carter and Fairchild Camera back in New York. In 1959 they exercised their option to buy Fairchild Semiconductor for $3 million. The next day Noyce, Moore, Hoerni, and the other five former Shockley elves woke up rich, or richer than they had ever dreamed of being. Each received $250,000 worth of Fairchild stock. Josiah Grinnell grew livid on the subject of alcohol. But he had nothing against money. He would have approved. NOYCE DIDN\u2019T KNOW what to make of his new wealth. He was thirty-one years old. For the past four years, ever since he had gone to work for Shockley, the semiconductor business had not seemed like a business at all but an esoteric game in which young electrical engineers competed for attaboys and the occasional round of applause after delivering a paper before the IEEE, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. It was a game supercharged by the fact that it was being played in the real world, to use a term that annoyed scientists in the universities. Someone\u2014Arnold Beckman, Sherman Fairchild, whoever\u2014was betting real money, and other bands of young elves, at Texas Instruments, RCA, Bell, were out there competing with you by the real world\u2019s rules, which required that you be practical as well as brilliant. Noyce started working for Fairchild Semiconductor in 1957 for twelve thousand dollars a year. When it came to money, he had assumed that he, like his father, would always be on somebody\u2019s payroll. Now, in 1959, when he talked to his father, he told him: \u201cThe money doesn\u2019t seem real. It\u2019s just a way of keeping score.\u201d Noyce took his family to visit his parents fairly often. He and Betty now had three children, Bill, Penny, and Polly, who was a year old. When they visited the folks, they went off to church on Sunday with the folks, as if it were all very much a part of their lives. In fact, Noyce had started drifting away from Congregationalism and the whole matter of churchgoing after he entered MIT. It was not a question of rejecting it. He never rejected anything about his upbringing in Grinnell. It was just that he was heading off somewhere else, down a different road. In that respect Noyce was like a great many bright young men and women from Dissenting Protestant families in the Middle West after the Second World War. They had been raised as Baptists, Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians, United Brethren, whatever. They had been led through the church door and prodded toward religion, but it had never come alive for them. Sundays made their skulls feel like dried-out husks. So they slowly walked away from the church and silently, without so much as a growl of rebellion, congratulated themselves on their independence of mind and headed into another way of life. Only decades later, in most cases, would they discover how, absentmindedly, inexplicably, they had brought the old ways along for the journey nonetheless. It was as if ... through some extraordinary mistake ... they had been sewn into the linings of their coats! Now that he had some money, Bob Noyce bought a bigger house. His and Betty\u2019s fourth child, Margaret, was born in 1960, and they wanted each child to have a bedroom. But the thought of moving into any of the \u201cbest\u201d neighborhoods in the Palo Alto area never even crossed his mind. The best neighborhoods were to be found in Atherton, in Burlingame, which was known as very social; or in the swell old sections of Palo Alto, near Stanford University. Instead, Noyce bought a California version of a French country house in Los Altos, a white stucco house with a steeply pitched roof. It was scenic up there in the hills, and cooler in the summer than it was down in the flatlands near the bay. The house had plenty of room, and he and Betty would be living a great deal better than most couples their age, but Los Altos had no social cachet and the house was not going to make House & Garden come banging on the door. No one could accuse them of being ostentatious. John Carter appointed Noyce general manager of the entire division, Fairchild Semiconductor, which was suddenly one of the hottest new outfits in the business world. NASA chose Noyce\u2019s integrated circuits for the first computers that astronauts would use on board their spacecraft (in the Gemini program). After that, orders poured in. In ten years Fairchild sales rose from a few thousand dollars a year to $130 million, and the number of employees rose from the original band of elves to twelve thousand. As the general manager, Noyce now had to deal with a matter Shockley had dealt with clumsily and prematurely, namely, new management techniques for this new industry. One day John Carter came to Mountain View for a close look at Noyce\u2019s semiconductor operation. Carter\u2019s office in Syosset, Long Island, arranged for a limousine and chauffeur to be at his disposal while he was in California. So Carter arrived at the tilt-up concrete building in Mountain View in the back of a black Cadillac limousine with a driver in the front wearing the complete chauffeur\u2019s uniform\u2014the black suit, the white shirt, the black necktie, and the black visored cap. That in itself was enough to turn heads at Fairchild Semiconductor. Nobody had ever seen a limousine and a chauffeur out there before. But that wasn\u2019t what fixed the day in everybody\u2019s memory. It was the fact that the driver stayed out there for almost eight hours, doing nothing. He stayed out there in his uniform, with his visored hat on, in the front seat of the limousine, all day, doing nothing but waiting for a man who was somewhere inside. John Carter was inside having a terrific chief executive officer\u2019s time for himself. He took a tour of the plant, he held conferences, he looked at figures, he nodded with satisfaction, he beamed his urbane Fifty-seventh Street Biggie CEO charm. And the driver sat out there all day engaged in the task of supporting a visored cap with his head. People started leaving their workbenches and going to the front windows just to take a look at this phenomenon. It seemed that bizarre. Here was a serf who did nothing all day but wait outside a door in order to be at the service of the haunches of his master instantly, whenever those haunches and the paunch and the jowls might decide to reappear. It wasn\u2019t merely that this little peek at the New York\u2013style corporate high life was unusual out here in the brown hills of the Santa Clara Valley. It was that it seemed terribly wrong. A certain instinct Noyce had about this new industry and the people who worked in it began to take on the outlines of a concept. Corporations in the East adopted a feudal approach to organization, without even being aware of it. There were kings and lords, and there were vassals, soldiers, yeomen, and serfs, with layers of protocol and perquisites, such as the car and driver, to symbolize superiority and establish the boundary lines. Back east the CEOs had offices with carved paneling, fake fireplaces, escritoires, berg\u00e8res, leather-bound books, and dressing rooms, like a suite in a baronial manor house. Fairchild Semiconductor needed a strict operating structure, particularly in this period of rapid growth, but it did not need a social structure. In fact, nothing could be worse. Noyce realized how much he detested the eastern corporate system of class and status with its endless gradations, topped off by the CEOs and vice-presidents who conducted their daily lives as if they were a corporate court and aristocracy. He rejected the idea of a social hierarchy at Fairchild. Not only would there be no limousines and chauffeurs, there would not even be any reserved parking places. Work began at eight a.m. for one and all, and it would be first come, first served, in the parking lot, for Noyce, Gordon Moore, Jean Hoerni, and everybody else. \u201cIf you come late,\u201d Noyce liked to say, \u201cyou just have to park in the back forty.\u201d And there would be no baronial office suites. The glorified warehouse on Charleston Road was divided into work bays and a couple of rows of cramped office cubicles. The cubicles were never improved. The decor remained Glorified Warehouse, and the doors were always open. Half the time Noyce, the chief administrator, was out in the laboratory anyway, wearing his white lab coat. Noyce came to work in a coat and tie, but soon the jacket and the tie were off, and that was fine for any other man in the place too. There were no rules of dress at all, except for some unwritten ones. Dress should be modest, modest in the social as well as the moral sense. At Fairchild there were no hard-worsted double-breasted pinstripe suits and shepherd\u2019s-check neckties. Sharp, elegant, fashionable, or alluring dress was a social blunder. Shabbiness was not a sin. Ostentation was. During the start-up phase at Fairchild Semiconductor there had been no sense of bosses and employees. There had been only a common sense of struggle out on a frontier. Everyone had internalized the goals of the venture. They didn\u2019t need exhortations from superiors. Besides, everyone had been so young! Noyce, the administrator or chief coordinator or whatever he should be called, had been just about the oldest person on the premises, and he had been barely thirty. And now, in the early 1960s, thanks to his athletic build and his dark brown hair with the Campus Kid hairline, he still looked very young. As Fairchild expanded, Noyce didn\u2019t even bother trying to find \u201cexperienced management personnel.\u201d Out here in California, in the semiconductor industry, they didn\u2019t exist. Instead, he recruited engineers right out of the colleges and graduate schools and gave them major responsibilities right off the bat. There was no \u201cstaff,\u201d no \u201ctop management\u201d other than the eight partners themselves. Major decisions were not bucked up a chain of command. Noyce held weekly meetings of people from all parts of the operation, and whatever had to be worked out was worked out right there in the room. Noyce wanted them all to keep internalizing the company\u2019s goals and to provide their own motivations, just as they had during the start-up phase. If they did that, they would have the capacity to make their own decisions. The young engineers who came to work for Fairchild could scarcely believe how much responsibility was suddenly thrust upon them. Some twenty-four-year-old just out of graduate school would find himself in charge of a major project with no one looking over his shoulder. A problem would come up, and he couldn\u2019t stand it, and he would go to Noyce and hyperventilate and ask him what to do. And Noyce would lower his head, turn on his 100-ampere eyes, listen, and say: \u201cLook, here are your guidelines. You\u2019ve got to consider A, you\u2019ve got to consider B, and you\u2019ve got to consider C.\u201d Then he would turn on the Gary Cooper smile: \u201cBut if you think I\u2019m going to make your decision for you, you\u2019re mistaken. Hey ... it\u2019s your ass.\u201d Back east, in the conventional corporation, any functionary wishing to make an unusually large purchase had to have the approval of a superior or two or three superiors or even a committee, a procedure that ate up days, weeks, in paperwork. Noyce turned that around. At Fairchild any engineer, even a weenie just out of Cal Tech, could make any purchase he wanted, no matter how enormous, unless someone else objected strongly enough to try to stop it. Noyce called this the Short Circuit Paper Route. There was only one piece of paper involved, the piece of paper the engineer handed somebody in the purchasing department. The spirit of the start-up phase! My God! Who could forget the exhilarations of the past few years! To be young and free out here on the silicon frontier! Noyce was determined to maintain that spirit during the expansion phase. And for the time being, at least, here in the early 1960s the notion of a permanent start-up operation didn\u2019t seem too farfetched. Fairchild was unable to coast on the tremendous advantage Noyce\u2019s invention of the integrated\u2028 circuit had provided. Competitors were setting up shop in the Santa Clara Valley like gold rushers. And where did they\u2028 come from? Why, from Fairchild itself! And how could that be? Nothing to it ... Defection capital! Defectors (or redefectors) from Fairchild started up more than fifty companies, all making or supplying microchips. Raytheon Semiconductor, Signetics, General Microelectronics, Intersil, Advanced Micro Devices, Qualidyne\u2014off they spun, each with a sillier pseudotech engineerologism for a name than the one before. Defectors! What a merry game that was. Jean Hoerni and three of the other original eight defectors from Shockley defected from Fairchild to form what would soon become known as Teledyne Semiconductors, and that was only round one. After all, why not make all the money for yourself! The urge to use defection capital was so irresistible that the word defection, with its note of betrayal, withered away. Defectors were merely the Fairchildren, as Adam Smith dubbed them. Occasionally defectors from other companies, such as the men from Texas Instruments and Westinghouse who started Siliconix, moved into the Santa Clara Valley to join the free-for-all. But it was the Fairchildren who turned the Santa Clara Valley into the Silicon Valley. Acre by acre the fruit trees were uprooted, and two-story Silicon Modern office buildings and factories went up. The state of California built a new freeway past the area, Route 280. Children heard the phrase \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d so often, they grew up thinking it was the name on the map. Everywhere the Fairchild \u00e9migr\u00e9s went, they took the Noyce approach with them. It wasn\u2019t enough to start up a company; you had to start up a community, a community in which there were no social distinctions, and it was first come, first served, in the parking lot, and everyone was supposed to internalize the common goals. The atmosphere of the new companies was so democratic, it startled businessmen from the East. Some fifty-five-year-old biggie with his jowls swelling up smoothly from out of his F. R. Tripler modified-spread white collar and silk jacquard-print necktie would call up from GE or RCA and say, \u201cThis is Harold B. Thatchwaite,\u201d and the twenty-three-year-old secretary on the other end of the line, out in the Silicon Valley, would say in one of those sunny blond pale-blue-eyed California voices: \u201cJust a minute, Hal, Jack will be right with you.\u201d And once he got to California and met this Jack for the first time, there he would be, the CEO himself, all of thirty-three years old, wearing no jacket, no necktie, just a checked shirt, khaki pants, and a pair of moccasins with welted seams the size of jumper cables. Naturally the first sounds out of this Jack\u2019s mouth would be: \u201cHi, Hal.\u201d It was the 1960s, and people in the East were hearing a lot about California surfers, California bikers, hot rodders, car customizers, California hippies, and political protesters, and the picture they got was of young people in jeans and T-shirts who were casual, spontaneous, impulsive, emotional, sensual, undisciplined, and obnoxiously proud of it. So these semiconductor outfits in the Silicon Valley with their CEOs dressed like camp counselors struck them as the business versions of the same thing. They couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. The new breed of the Silicon Valley lived for work. They were disciplined to the point of back spasms. They worked long hours and kept working on weekends. They became absorbed in their companies the way men once had in the palmy days of the automobile industry. In the Silicon Valley a young engineer would go to work at eight in the morning, work right through lunch, leave the plant at six-thirty or seven, drive home, play with the baby for half an hour, have dinner with his wife, get in bed with her, give her a quick toss, then get up and leave her there in the dark and work at his desk for two or three hours on \u201ca coupla things I had to bring home with me.\u201d Or else he would leave the plant and decide, well, maybe he would drop in at the Wagon Wheel for a drink before he went home. Every year there was some place, the Wagon Wheel, Chez Yvonne, Rickey\u2019s, the Roundhouse, where members of this esoteric fraternity, the young men and women of the semiconductor industry, would head after work to have a drink and gossip and brag and trade war stories about phase jitters, phantom circuits, bubble memories, pulse trains, bounceless contacts, burst modes, leapfrog tests, p-n junctions, sleeping-sickness modes, slow-death episodes, RAMs, NAKs, MOSes, PCMs, PROMs, PROM blowers, PROM burners, PROM blasters, and teramagnitudes, meaning multiples of a million millions. So then he wouldn\u2019t get home until nine, and the baby was asleep, and dinner was cold, and the wife was frosted off, and he would stand there and cup his hands as if making an imaginary snowball and try to explain to her ... while his mind trailed off to other matters, LSIs, VLSIs, alpha flux, de-rezzing, forward biases, parasitic signals, and that tera-sexy little cookie from Signetics he had met at the Wagon Wheel, who understood such things. It was not a great way of life for marriages. By the late 1960s the toll of divorces seemed to those in the business to be as great as that of NASA\u2019s boomtowns, Cocoa Beach, Florida, and Clear Lake, Texas, where other young engineers were giving themselves over to a new technology as if it were a religious mission. The second time around they tended to \u201cintra-marry.\u201d They married women who worked for Silicon Valley companies and who could comprehend and even learn to live with their twenty-four-hour obsessions. In the Silicon Valley an engineer was under pressure to reinvent the integrated circuit every six months. In 1959 Noyce\u2019s invention had made it possible to put an entire electrical circuit on a chip of silicon the size of a fingernail. By 1964 you had to know how to put ten circuits on a chip that size just to enter the game, and the stakes kept rising. Six years later the figure was one thousand circuits on a single chip; six years after that it would be thirty-two thousand\u2014and everyone was talking about how the real breakthrough would be sixty-four thousand. Noyce himself led the race; by 1968 he had a dozen new integrated-circuit and transistor patents. And what amazing things such miniaturization made possible! In December 1968 NASA sent the first manned flight to the moon, Apollo 8. Three astronauts, Frank Borman, James Lovell, and William Anders, flew into earth orbit, then fired a rocket at precisely the right moment in order to break free of the earth\u2019s gravitational field and fly through the minute \u201cwindow\u201d in space that would put them on course to the moon rather than into orbit around the sun, from which there could be no return. They flew to the moon, went into orbit around it, saw the dark side, which no one had ever seen, not even with a telescope, then fired a rocket at precisely the right moment in order to break free of the moon\u2019s gravitational pull and go into the proper trajectory for their return to earth. None of it would have been possible without onboard computers. People were beginning to talk about all that the space program was doing for the computer sciences. Noyce knew it was the other way around. Only the existence of a miniature computer two feet long, one foot wide, and six inches thick\u2014exactly three thousand times smaller than the old ENIAC and far faster and more reliable\u2014made the flight of Apollo 8 possible. And there would have been no miniature computer without the integrated circuits invented by Noyce and Kilby and refined by Noyce and the young semiconductor zealots of the Silicon Valley, the new breed who were building the road El Dorado. Noyce used to go into a slow burn that year, 1968, when the newspapers, the magazines, and the television networks got on the subject of the youth. The youth was a favorite topic in 1968. Riots broke out on the campuses as the antiwar movement reached its peak following North Vietnam\u2019s Tet offensive. Black youths rioted in the cities. The Yippies, supposedly a coalition of hippies and campus activists, managed to sabotage the Democratic National Convention by setting off some highly televised street riots. The press seemed to enjoy presenting these youths as the avant-garde who were sweeping aside the politics and morals of the past and shaping America\u2019s future. The French writer Jean-Francois Revel toured American campuses and called the radical youth homo novus, \u201cthe New Man,\u201d as if they were the latest, most advanced product of human evolution itself, after the manner of the superchildren in Arthur C. Clarke\u2019s Childhood\u2019s End. Homo novus? As Noyce saw it, these so-called radical youth movements were shot through with a yearning for a preindustrial Arcadia. They wanted, or thought they wanted, to return to the earth and live on organic vegetables and play folk songs from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. They were antitechnology. They looked upon science as an instrument monopolized by the military-industrial complex. They used this phrase, \u201cthe military-industrial complex,\u201d all the time. If industry or the military underwrote scientific research in the universities\u2014and they underwrote a great deal of it\u2014then that research was evil. The universities were to be pure and above exploitation, except, of course, by ideologues of the Left. The homo novus had set up a chain of logic that went as follows: since science equals the military-industrial complex, and the military-industrial complex equals capitalism, and capitalism equals fascism, therefore science equals fascism. And therefore, these much-vaunted radical youths, these shapers of the future, attacked the forward positions of American technology, including the space program and the very idea of the computer. And therefore these creators of the future were what? They were Luddites. They wanted to destroy the new machines. They were the reactionaries of the new age. They were an avant-garde to the rear. They wanted to call off the future. They were stillborn, ossified, prematurely senile. If you wanted to talk about the creators of the future\u2014well, here they were! Here in the Silicon Valley! Just before Apollo 8 circled the moon, Bob Noyce turned forty-one. By age forty-one he had become such a good skier, people were urging him to enter competitions. He had taken up hang gliding and scuba diving. When his daughter Penny was almost fourteen, he asked her what she wanted for her birthday, and she said she wanted to drop from an airplane by parachute. Noyce managed to convince her to settle for glider lessons instead. Then, because it made him restless to just stand around an airfield and watch her soar up above, he took flying lessons, bought an airplane, and began flying the family up through the mountain passes to Aspen, Colorado, for skiing weekends. He had the same lean, powerful build as he had had twenty years before, when he was on the swimming team at Grinnell College. He had the same thick dark brown hair and the same hairline. It looked as if every hair in his head were nailed in. He looked as if he could walk out the door any time he wanted to and win another Midwest Conference diving championship. And he was one of the oldest CEOs in the semiconductor business! He was the Edison of the bunch! He was the father of the Silicon Valley! The rest of the hotshots were younger. It was a business dominated by people in their twenties and thirties. In the Silicon Valley there was a phenomenon known as burnout. After five or ten years of obsessive racing for the semiconductor high stakes, five or ten years of lab work; work lunches, workaholic drinks at the Wagon Wheel, and work-battering of the wife and children, an engineer would reach his middle thirties and wake up one day\u2014and he was finished. The game was over. It was called burnout, suggesting mental and physical exhaustion brought about by overwork. But Noyce was convinced it was something else entirely. It was ... age, or age and status. In the semiconductor business, research engineering was like pitching in baseball; it was 60 percent of the game. Semiconductor research was one of those highly mathematical sciences, such as microbiology, in which, for reasons one could only guess at, the great flashes, the critical moments of inspiration, came mainly to those who were young, often to men in their twenties. The thirty-five-year-old burnouts weren\u2019t suffering from exhaustion, as Noyce saw it. They were being overwhelmed, outperformed, by the younger talent coming up behind them. It wasn\u2019t the central nervous system that was collapsing, it was the ego. Now here you saw youth in the vanguard, on the leading edge! Here you saw the youths who were, in fact, shaping the future! Here you saw, if you insisted on the term, the homo novus! But why insist? For they were also of the same stripe as Josiah Grinnell, who had founded Grinnell, Iowa, at the age of thirty-three. IT WAS IN 1968 that Noyce pulled off the redefection of all redefections. Fairchild Semiconductors had generated tremendous profits for the parent company back east. It now appeared to Noyce that John Carter and Sherman Fairchild had been diverting too much of that money into new start-up ventures, outside the semiconductor field. As a matter of fact, Noyce disliked many things \u201cback east.\u201d He disliked the periodic trips to New York, for which he dressed in gray suits, white shirts, and neckties and reported to the royal corporate court and wasted days trying to bring them up to date on what was happening in California. Fairchild was rather enlightened, for an eastern corporation, but the truth was, there was no one back east who understood how to run a corporation in the United States in the second half of the twentieth century. Back east they had never progressed beyond the year 1940. Consequently, they were still hobbled by all of the primitive stupidities of bureaucratism and labor-management battles. They didn\u2019t have the foggiest comprehension of the Silicon Valley idea of a corporate community. The brightest young businessmen in the East were trained\u2014most notably at the Harvard Business School\u2014to be little Machiavellian princes. Greed and strategy were all that mattered. They were trained for failure. Noyce and Gordon Moore, two of the three original eight Shockley elves still at Fairchild, decided to form their own company. They went to Arthur Rock, who had helped provide the start-up money for Fairchild Semiconductors when he was at Hayden Stone. Now Rock had his own venture capital operation. Noyce took great pleasure in going through none of the steps in corporate formation that the business schools talked about. He and Moore didn\u2019t even write up a proposal. They merely told Rock what they wanted to do and put up $500,000 of their own money, $250,000 each. That seemed to impress Rock more than anything they could possibly have written down, and he rounded up $2.5 million of the start-up money. A few months later another $300,000 came, this time from Grinnell College. Noyce had been on the college\u2019s board of trustees since 1962, and a board member had asked him to give the college a chance to invest, should the day come when he started his own company. So Grinnell College became one of the gamblers betting on Noyce and Intel\u2014the pseudotech engineerologism Noyce and Moore dreamed up as the corporate name. Josiah Grinnell would have loved it. The defection of Noyce and Moore from Fairchild was an earthquake even within an industry jaded by the very subject of defections. In the Silicon Valley everybody had looked upon Fairchild as Noyce\u2019s company. He was the magnet that held the place together. With Noyce gone, it was obvious that the entire work force would be up for grabs. As one wag put it, \u201cPeople were practically driving trucks over to Fairchild Semiconductor and loading up with employees.\u201d Fairchild responded by pulling off one of the grossest raids in corporate history. One day the troops who were left at Fairchild looked across their partitions and saw a platoon of young men with terrific suntans moving into the executive office cubicles. They would always remember what terrific suntans they had. They were C. Lester Hogan, chief executive officer of the Motorola semiconductor division in Phoenix, and his top echelon of engineers and administrators. Or, rather, C. Lester Hogan of Motorola until yesterday. Fairchild had hired the whole bunch away from Motorola and installed them in place of Noyce & Co. like a matched set. There was plenty of sunshine in the Santa Clara Valley, but nobody here had suntans like this bunch from Phoenix. Fairchild had lured the leader of the young sun-gods out of the Arizona desert in the most direct way imaginable. He had offered him an absolute fortune in money and stock. Hogan received so much, the crowd at the Wagon Wheel said, that henceforth wealth in the Silicon Valley would be measured in units called hogans.*  Noyce and Moore, meanwhile, started up Intel in a tilt-up concrete building that Jean Hoerni and his group had built, but no longer used, in Santa Clara, which was near Mountain View. Once again there was an echo of Shockley. They opened up shop with a dozen bright young electrical engineers, plus a few clerical and maintenance people, and bet everything on research and product development. Noyce and Moore, like Shockley, put on the white coats and worked at the laboratory tables. They would not be competing with Fairchild or anyone else in the already established semiconductor markets. They had decided to move into the most backward of computer technology, which was data storage, or \u201cmemory.\u201d A computer\u2019s memory was stored in ceramic ringlets known as cores. Each ringlet contained one \u201cbit\u201d of information, a \u201cyes\u201d or a \u201cno,\u201d in the logic of the binary system of mathematics that computers employ. Within two years Noyce and Moore had developed the 1103 memory chip, a chip of silicon and polysilicon the size of two letters in a line of type. Each chip contained four thousand transistors, did the work of a thousand ceramic ringlets, and did it faster. The production line still consisted of rows of women sitting at tables as in the old shed-and-rafter days, but the work bays now looked like something from out of an inter-galactic adventure movie. The women engraved the circuits on the silicon photographically, wearing antiseptic Mars Voyage suits, headgear, and gloves because a single speck of dust could ruin one of the miniature circuits. The circuits were so small that \u201cminiature\u201d no longer sounded small enough. The new word was \u201cmicrominiature.\u201d Everything now took place in an air-conditioned ice cube of vinyl tiles, stainless steel, fluorescent lighting, and backlit plastic.  The 1103 memory chip opened up such a lucrative field that other companies, including Fairchild, fought desperately just to occupy the number-two position, filling the orders Intel couldn\u2019t take care of. At the end of Intel\u2019s first year in business, which had been devoted almost exclusively to research, sales totaled less than three thousand dollars and the work force numbered forty-two. In 1972, thanks largely to the 1103 chip, sales were $23.4 million and the work force numbered 1,002. In the next year sales almost tripled, to $66 million, and the work force increased two and a half times, to 2,528. So Noyce had the chance to run a new company from start-up to full production precisely the way he thought Shockley should have run his in Palo Alto back in the late 1950s. From the beginning Noyce gave all the engineers and most of the office workers stock options. He had learned at Fairchild that in a business so dependent upon research, stock options were a more powerful incentive than profit sharing. People sharing profits naturally wanted to concentrate on products that were already profitable rather than plunge into avant-garde research that would not pay off in the short run even if it were successful. But people with stock options lived for research breakthroughs. The news would send a semiconductor company\u2019s stock up immediately, regardless of profits. Noyce\u2019s idea was that every employee should feel that he could go as far and as fast in this industry as his talent would take him. He didn\u2019t want any employee to look at the structure of Intel and see a complex set of hurdles. It went without saying that there would be no social hierarchy at Intel, no executive suites, no pinstripe set, no reserved parking places, or other symbols of the hierarchy. But Noyce wanted to go further. He had never liked the business of the office cubicles at Fairchild. As miserable as they were, the mere possession of one symbolized superior rank. At Intel executives would not be walled off in offices. Everybody would be in one big room. There would be nothing but low partitions to separate Noyce or anyone else from the lowliest stock boys trundling in the accordion printout paper. The whole place became like a shed. When they first moved into the building, Noyce worked at an old, scratched, secondhand metal desk. As the company expanded, Noyce kept the same desk, and new stenographers, just hired, were given desks that were not only newer but bigger and better than his. Everybody noticed the old beat-up desk, since there was nothing to keep anybody from looking at every inch of Noyce\u2019s office space. Noyce enjoyed this subversion of the eastern corporate protocol of small metal desks for underlings and large wooden desks for overlords. At Intel, Noyce decided to eliminate the notion of levels of management altogether. He and Moore ran the show; that much was clear. But below them there were only the strategic business segments, as they called them. They were comparable to the major departments in an orthodox corporation, but they had far more autonomy. Each was run like a separate corporation. Middle managers at Intel had more responsibility than most vice-presidents back east. They were also much younger and got lower-back pain and migraines earlier. At Intel, if the marketing division had to make a major decision that would affect the engineering division, the problem was not routed up a hierarchy to a layer of executives who oversaw both departments. Instead, \u201ccouncils,\u201d made up of people already working on the line in the divisions that were affected, would meet and work it out themselves. The councils moved horizontally, from problem to problem. They had no vested power. They were not governing bodies but coordinating councils. Noyce was a great believer in meetings. The people in each department or work unit were encouraged to convene meetings whenever the spirit moved them. There were rooms set aside for meetings at Intel, and they were available on a first come, first served basis, just like the parking spaces. Often meetings were held at lunchtime. That was not a policy; it was merely an example set by Noyce. There were no executive lunches at Intel. Back east, in New York, executives treated lunch as a daily feast of the nobility, a sumptuous celebration of their eminence, in the Lucullan expense-account restaurants of Manhattan. The restaurants in the East and West Fifties of Manhattan were like something from out of a dream. They recruited chefs from all over Europe and the Orient. Pasta primavera, saucisson, sorrel mousse, homard cardinal, terrine de l\u00e9gumes Montesquiou, paillard de pigeon, medallions of beef Chinese Gordon, veal Valdostana, Verbena roast turkey with Hayman sweet potatoes flown in from the eastern shore of Virginia, raspberry souffl\u00e9, baked Alaska, zabaglione, pear torte, cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e\u2014and the wines! and the brandies! and the port! the Sambuca! the cigars! and the decor!\u2014walls with lacquered woodwork and winking mirrors and sconces with little pleated peach-colored shades, all of it designed by the very same decorators who walked duchesses to parties for Halston on Eaton Square!\u2014and captains and ma\u00eetre d\u2019s who made a fuss over you in movie French in front of your clients and friends and fellow overlords!\u2014it was Mount Olympus in mid-Manhattan every day from twelve-thirty to three p.m., and you emerged into the pearl-gray light of the city with such ambrosia pumping through your veins that even the clotted streets with the garbagemen backing up their grinder trucks and yelling, \u201c\u2019Mon back, \u2019mon back, \u2019mon back, \u2019mon back,\u201d as if talking Urban Chippewa\u2014even this became part of the bliss of one\u2019s eminence in the corporate world! There were many chief executive officers who kept their headquarters in New York long after the last rational reason for doing so had vanished ... because of the ineffable experience of being a CEO and having lunch five days a week in Manhattan! At Intel lunch had a different look to it. You could tell when it was noon at Intel, because at noon men in white aprons arrived at the front entrance gasping from the weight of the trays they were carrying. The trays were loaded down with deli sandwiches and waxed cups full of drinks with clear plastic tops, with globules of Sprite or Diet Shasta sliding around the tops on the inside. That was your lunch. You ate some sandwiches made of roast beef or chicken sliced into translucent rectangles by a machine in a processing plant and then reassembled on the bread in layers that gave off dank whiffs of hormones and chemicals, and you washed it down with Sprite or Diet Shasta, and you sat amid the particle-board partitions and metal desktops, and you kept your mind on your committee meeting. That was what Noyce did, and that was what everybody else did. If Noyce called a meeting, then he set the agenda. But after that, everybody was an equal. If you were a young engineer and you had an idea you wanted to get across, you were supposed to speak up and challenge Noyce or anybody else who didn\u2019t get it right away. This was a little bit of heaven. You were face to face with the inventor, or the co-inventor, of the very road to El Dorado, and he was only forty-one years old, and he was listening to you. He had his head down and his eyes beamed up at you, and he was absorbing it all. He wasn\u2019t a boss. He was Gary Cooper! He was here to help you be self-reliant and do as much as you could on your own. This wasn\u2019t a corporation ... it was a congregation. By the same token, there were sermons and homilies. At Intel everyone\u2014Noyce included\u2014was expected to attend sessions on \u201cthe Intel Culture.\u201d At these sessions the principles by which the company was run were spelled out and discussed. Some of the discussions had to do specifically with matters of marketing or production. Others had to do with the broadest philosophical principles of Intel and were explained via the Socratic method at management seminars by Intel\u2019s number-three man, Andrew Grove. Grove would say, \u201cHow would you sum up the Intel approach?\u201d  Many hands would go up, and Grove would choose one, and the eager communicant would say: \u201cAt Intel you don\u2019t wait for someone else to do it. You take the ball yourself and you run with it.\u201d And Grove would say, \u201cWrong. At Intel you take the ball yourself and you let the air out and you fold the ball up and put it in your pocket. Then you take another ball and run with it and when you\u2019ve crossed the goal you take the second ball out of your pocket and reinflate it and score twelve points instead of six.\u201d Grove was the most colorful person at Intel. He was a thin man in his mid-thirties with tight black curls all over his head. The curls ran down into a pair of muttonchops that seemed to run together like goulash with his moustache. Every day he wore either a turtleneck jersey or an open shirt with an ornamental chain twinkling on his chest. He struck outsiders as the epitome of a style of the early 1970s known as California Groovy. In fact, Grove was the epitome of the religious principle that the greater the freedom\u2014for example, the freedom to dress as you pleased\u2014the greater the obligation to exercise discipline. Grove\u2019s own groovy outfits were neat and clean. The truth was, he was a bit of a bear on the subject of neatness and cleanliness. He held what he called \u201cMr. Clean inspections,\u201d showing up in various work areas wearing his muttonchops and handlebar moustache and his Harry Belafonte cane cutter\u2019s shirt and the gleaming chainwork, inspecting offices for books stacked too high, papers strewn over desktops, everything short of running a white glove over the shelves, as if this were some California Groovy Communal version of Parris Island, while the chain twinkled in his chest hairs. Grove was also the inspiration for such items as the performance ratings and the Late List. Each employee received a report card periodically with a grade based on certain presumably objective standards. The grades were superior, exceeds requirements, meets requirements, marginally meets requirements, and does not meet requirements. This was the equivalent of A, B, C, D, and F in school. Noyce was all for it. \u201cIf you\u2019re ambitious and hardworking,\u201d he would say, \u201cyou want to be told how you\u2019re doing.\u201d In Noyce\u2019s view, most of the young hotshots who were coming to work for Intel had never had the benefit of honest grades in their lives. In the late 1960s and early 1970s college faculties had been under pressure to give all students passing marks so they wouldn\u2019t have to go off to Vietnam, and they had caved in, until the entire grading system was meaningless. At Intel they would learn what measuring up meant. The Late List was also like something from a strict school. Everyone was expected at work at eight a.m. A record was kept of how many employees arrived after 8:10 a.m. If 7 percent or more were late for three months, then everybody in the section had to start signing in. There was no inevitable penalty for being late, however. It was up to each department head to make of the Late List what he saw fit. If he knew a man was working overtime every night on a certain project then his presence on the Late List would probably be regarded as nothing more than that, a line on a piece of paper. At bottom\u2014and this was part of the Intel Culture\u2014Noyce and Grove knew that penalties were very nearly useless. Things like report cards and Late Lists worked only if they stimulated self-discipline. The worst form of discipline at Intel was to be called on the Antron II carpet before Noyce himself. Noyce insisted on ethical behavior in all dealings within the company and between companies. That was the word people used to describe his approach, ethical; that and moral. Noyce was known as a very aggressive businessman, but he stopped short of cutting throats\u2014and he never talked about revenge. He would not tolerate peccadilloes such as little personal I\u2019ll-reimburse-it-on-Monday dips into the petty cash. Noyce\u2019s Strong Silent stare, his Gary Cooper approach, could be mortifying as well as inspiring. When he was angry, his baritone voice never rose. He seemed like a powerful creature that only through the greatest self-control was refraining from an attack. He somehow created the impression that if pushed one more inch, he would fight. As a consequence he seldom had to. No one ever trifled with Bob Noyce. Noyce managed to create an ethical universe within an inherently amoral setting: the American business corporation in the second half of the twentieth century. At Intel there was good and there was evil, and there was freedom and there was discipline, and to an extraordinary degree employees internalized these matters, as if members of Cromwell\u2019s army. As the work force grew at Intel, and the profits soared, labor unions, chiefly the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the Teamsters, and the Stationary Engineers Union, made several attempts to organize Intel. Noyce made known, albeit quietly, that he regarded unionization as a death threat to Intel, and to the semiconductor industry generally. Labor-management battles were part of the ancient terrain of the East. If Intel were divided into workers and bosses, with the implication that each side had to squeeze its money out of the hides of the other, the enterprise would be finished. Motivation would no longer be internal; it would be objectified in the deadly form of work rules and grievance procedures. The one time it came down to a vote, the union lost by the considerable margin of four to one. Intel\u2019s employees agreed with Noyce. Unions were part of the dead hand of the past.... Noyce and Intel were on the road to El Dorado. By the early 1970s Noyce and Moore\u2019s 1103 memory chip had given this brand-new company an entire corner of the semiconductor market. But that was only the start. Now a thirty-two-year-old Intel engineer named Ted Hoff came up with an invention as important as Noyce\u2019s integrated circuit had been a decade earlier: the microprocessor. The microprocessor was known as \u201cthe computer on a chip,\u201d because it put all the arithmetic and logic functions of a computer on a chip the size of the head of a tack. The possibilities for creating and using small computers now surpassed most people\u2019s imagining, even within the industry. One of the more obvious possibilities was placing a small computer in the steering and braking mechanisms of a car that would take over for the driver in case of a skid or excessive speed on a curve. In Ted Hoff, Noyce was looking at proof enough of his hypothesis that out here on the electrical frontier the great flashes came to the young. Hoff was about the same age Noyce had been when he invented his integrated circuit. The glory was now Hoff\u2019s. But Noyce took Hoff\u2019s triumph as proof of a second hypothesis. If you created the right type of corporate community, the right type of autonomous congregation, genius would flower. Certainly the corporate numbers were flowering. The news of the microprocessor, on top of the success of the 1103 memory chip, nearly trebled the value of Intel stock from 1971 to 1973. Noyce\u2019s own holdings were worth $18.5 million. He was in roughly the same position as Josiah Grinnell a hundred years before, when Grinnell brought Rock Island Railroad into Iowa. NOYCE CONTINUED TO live in the house in Los Altos hills that he had bought in 1960. He was not reluctant to spend his money; he was merely reluctant to show it. He spent a fortune on landscaping, but you could do that and the world would be none the wiser. Gradually the house disappeared from view behind an enormous wall of trees, tropical bushes, and cockatoo flowers. Noyce had a pond created on the back lawn, a waterscape elaborate enough to put on a bus tour, but nobody other than guests ever saw it. The lawn stretched on for several acres and had a tennis court, a swimming pool, and more walls of boughs and hot-pastel blossoms, and the world saw none of that, either. Noyce drove a Porsche roadster, and he didn\u2019t mind letting it out for a romp. Back east, when men made a great deal of money, they tended to put a higher and higher value on their own hides. Noyce, on the other hand, seemed to enjoy finding new ways to hang his out over the edge. He took up paragliding over the ski slopes at Aspen on a Rogolla wing. He built a Quicksilver hang glider and flew it off cliffs until a friend of his, a champion at the sport, fractured his pelvis and a leg flying a Quicksilver. He also took up scuba diving, and now he had his Porsche. The high-performance foreign sports car became one of the signatures of the successful Silicon Valley entrepreneur. The sports car was perfect. Its richness consisted of something small, dense, and hidden: the engineering beneath the body shell. Not only that, the very luxury of a sports car was the experience of driving it yourself. A sports car didn\u2019t even suggest a life with servants. Porsches and Ferraris became the favorites. By 1975 the Ferrari agency in Los Gatos was the second biggest Ferrari agency on the West Coast. Noyce also bought a 1947 Republic Seabee amphibious airplane, so that he could take the family for weekends on the lakes in northern California. He now had two aircraft, but he flew the ships himself. Noyce was among the richest individuals on the San Francisco Peninsula, as well as the most important figure in the Silicon Valley, but his name seldom appeared in the San Francisco newspapers. When it did, it was in the business section, not on the society page. That, too, became the pattern for the new rich of the Silicon Valley. San Francisco was barely forty-five minutes up the Bayshore Freeway from Los Altos, but psychologically San Francisco was an entire continent away. It was a city whose luminaries kept looking back east, to New York, to see if they were doing things correctly. In 1974 Noyce wound up in a situation that to some seemed an all-too-typical Mid-life in the Silicon Valley story. He and Betty, his wife of twenty-one years, were divorced, and the following year he \u201cintra-married.\u201d Noyce, who was forty-seven, married Intel\u2019s personnel director, Ann Bowers, who was thirty-seven. The divorce was mentioned in the San Francisco Chronicle, but not as a social note. It was a major business story. Under California law, Betty received half the family\u2019s assets. When word got out that she was going to sell off $6 million of her Intel stock in the interest of diversifying her fortune, it threw the entire market in Intel stock into a temporary spin. Betty left California and went to live in a village on the coast of Maine. Noyce kept the house in Los Altos. By this time, the mid-1970s, the Silicon Valley had become the late-twentieth-century-California version of a new city, and Noyce and other entrepreneurs began to indulge in some introspection. For ten years, thanks to racial hostilities and the leftist politics of the antiwar movement, the national press had dwelled on the subject of ethnic backgrounds. This in itself tended to make the engineers and entrepreneurs of the Silicon Valley conscious of how similar most of them were. Most of the major figures, like Noyce himself, had grown up and gone to college in small towns in the Middle West and the West. John Bardeen had grown up in and gone to college in Madison, Wisconsin. Walter Brattain had grown up in and gone to college in Washington. Shockley grew up in Palo Alto at a time when it was a small college town and went to the California Institute of Technology. Jack Kilby was born in Jefferson City, Missouri, and went to college at the University of Illinois. William Hewlett was born in Ann Arbor and went to school at Stanford. David Packard grew up in Pueblo, Colorado, and went to Stanford. Oliver Buckley grew up in Sloane, Iowa, and went to college at Grinnell. Lee De Forest came from Council Bluffs, Iowa (and went to Yale). And Thomas Edison grew up in Port Huron, Michigan, and didn\u2019t go to college at all. Some of them, such as Noyce and Shockley, had gone east to graduate school at MIT, since it was the most prestigious engineering school in the United States. But MIT had proved to be a backwater ... the sticks ... when it came to the most advanced form of engineering, solid-state electronics. Grinnell College, with its one thousand students, had been years ahead of MIT. The picture had been the same on the other great frontier of technology in the second half of the twentieth century, namely, the space program. The engineers who fulfilled one of man\u2019s most ancient dreams, that of traveling to the moon, came from the same background, the small towns of the Midwest and the West. After the triumph of Apollo 11, when Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first mortals to walk on the moon, NASA\u2019s administrator, Tom Paine, happened to remark in conversation: \u201cThis was the triumph of the squares.\u201d A reporter overheard him\u2014and did the press ever have a time with that! But Paine had come up with a penetrating insight. As it says in the Book of Matthew, the last shall be first. It was engineers from the supposedly backward and narrow-minded boondocks who had provided not only the genius but also the passion and the daring that won the space race and carried out John F. Kennedy\u2019s exhortation, back in 1961, to put a man on the moon \u201cbefore this decade is out.\u201d The passion and the daring of these engineers was as remarkable as their talent. Time after time they had to shake off the meddling hands of timid souls from back east. The contribution of MIT to Project Mercury was minus one. The minus one was Jerome Wiesner of the MIT electronic research lab, who was brought in by Kennedy as a special adviser to straighten out the space program when it seemed to be faltering early in 1961. Wiesner kept flinching when he saw what NASA\u2019s boondockers were preparing to do. He tried to persuade Kennedy to forfeit the manned space race to the Soviets and concentrate instead on unmanned scientific missions. The boondockers of Project Mercury, starting with the project\u2019s director, Bob Gilruth, an aeronautical engineer from Nashwauk, Minnesota, dodged Wiesner for months, like moonshiners evading a roadblock, until they got astronaut Alan Shepard launched on the first Mercury mission. Who had time to waste on players as behind the times as Jerome Wiesner and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ... out here on technology\u2019s leading edge? Just why was it that small-town boys from the Middle West dominated the engineering frontiers? Noyce concluded it was because in a small town you became a technician, a tinker, an engineer, and an inventor, by necessity. \u201cIn a small town,\u201d Noyce liked to say, \u201cwhen something breaks down, you don\u2019t wait around for a new part, because it\u2019s not coming. You make it yourself.\u201d Yet in Grinnell necessity had been the least of the mothers of invention. There had been something else about Grinnell, something people Noyce\u2019s age could feel but couldn\u2019t name. It had to do with the fact that Grinnell had once been a religious community; not merely a town with a church but a town that was inseparable from the church. In Josiah Grinnell\u2019s day most of the townspeople were devout Congregationalists, and the rest were smart enough to act as if they were. Anyone in Grinnell who aspired to the status of feed-store clerk or better joined the First Congregational Church. By the end of the Second World War educated people in Grinnell, and in all the Grinnells of the Middle West, had begun to drop this side of their history into a lake of amnesia. They gave in to the modem urge to be urbane. They themselves began to enjoy sniggering over Sherwood Anderson\u2019s Winesburg, Ohio, Sinclair Lewis\u2019s Main Street, and Grant Wood\u2019s American Gothic. Once the amnesia set in, all they remembered from the old days were the austere moral codes, which in some cases still hung on. Josiah Grinnell\u2019s real estate covenants prohibiting drinking, for example.... Just imagine! How absurd it was to see these unburied bones of something that had once been strong and alive. That something was Dissenting Protestantism itself. Oh, it had once been quite strong and very much alive! The passion\u2014the exhilaration!\u2014of those early days was what no one could any longer recall. To be a believing Protestant in a town such as Grinnell in the middle of the nineteenth century was to experience a spiritual ecstasy greater than any that the readers of Main Street or the viewers of American Gothic were likely to know in their lifetimes. Josiah Grinnell had gone to Iowa in 1854 to create nothing less than a City of Light. He was a New Englander who had given up on the East. He had founded the first Congregational church in Washington, D.C., and then defected from it when the congregation, mostly southerners, objected to his antislavery views. He went to New York and met the famous editor of the New York Herald, Horace Greeley. It was while talking to Josiah Grinnell, who was then thirty-two and wondering what to do with his life, that Greeley uttered the words for which he would be remembered forever after: \u201cGo west, young man, go west.\u201d So Grinnell went to Iowa, and he and three friends bought up five thousand acres of land in order to start up a Congregational community the way he thought it should be done. A City of Light! The first thing he organized was the congregation. The second was the college. Oxford and Cambridge had started banning Dissenting Protestants in the seventeenth century; Dissenters founded their own schools and colleges. Grinnell became a champion of \u201cfree schools,\u201d and it was largely thanks to him that Iowa had one of the first and best public-school systems in the west. To this day Iowa has the highest literacy rate of any state. In the 1940s a bright youngster whose parents were not rich\u2014such as Bob Noyce or his brother Donald\u2014was far more likely to receive a superior education in Iowa than in Massachusetts. And if he was extremely bright, if he seemed to have the quality known as genius, he was infinitely more likely to go into engineering in Iowa, or Illinois or Wisconsin, than anywhere in the East. Back east engineering was an unfashionable field. The East looked to Europe in matters of intellectual fashion, and in Europe the ancient aristocratic bias against manual labor lived on. Engineering was looked upon as nothing more than manual labor raised to the level of a science. There was \u201cpure\u201d science and there was engineering, which was merely practical. Back east engineers ranked, socially, below lawyers; doctors; Army colonels; Navy captains; English, history, biology, chemistry, and physics professors; and business executives. This piece of European snobbery had never reached Grinnell, Iowa, however. Neither had the corollary piece of snobbery that said a scientist was lowering himself by going into commerce. Dissenting Protestants looked upon themselves as secular saints, men and women of God who did God\u2019s work not as penurious monks and nuns but as successful workers in the everyday world. To be rich and successful was even better, and just as righteous. One of Josiah Grinnell\u2019s main projects was to bring the Rock Island Railroad into Iowa. Many in his congregation became successful farmers of the gloriously fertile soil around Grinnell. But there was no sense of rich and poor. All the congregation opened up the virgin land in a common struggle out on the frontier. They had given up the comforts of the East ... in order to create a City of Light in the name of the Lord. Every sacrifice, every privation, every denial of the pleasures of the flesh, brought them closer to that state of bliss in which the light of God shines forth from the apex of the soul. What were the momentary comforts and aristocratic poses of the East ... compared to this? Where would the fleshpots back east be on that day when the heavens opened up and a light fell \u2019round about them and a voice from on high said: \u201cWhy mockest thou me?\u201d The light! The light! Who, if he had ever known that glorious light, if he had ever let his soul burst forth into that light, could ever mock these, my very seed, with a Main Street or an American Gothic! There, in Grinnell, reigned the passion that enabled men and women to settle the West in the nineteenth century against the most astonishing odds and in the face of overbearing hardships. By the standards of St. Francis of Assisi or St. Jerome, who possessed nothing beyond the cloak of righteousness, Josiah Grinnell was a very secular saint, indeed. And Robert Noyce\u2019s life was a great deal more secular than Josiah Grinnell\u2019s. Noyce had wandered away from the church itself. He smoked. He took a drink when he felt like it. He had gotten a divorce. Nevertheless, when Noyce went west, he brought Grinnell with him ... unaccountably sewn into the lining of his coat! In the last stage of his career Josiah Grinnell had turned from the building of his community to broader matters affecting Iowa and the Middle West. In 1863 he became one of midland Iowa\u2019s representatives in Congress. Likewise, in 1974 Noyce turned over the actual running of Intel to Gordon Moore and Andrew Grove and kicked himself upstairs to become chairman of the board. His major role became that of spokesman for the Silicon Valley and the electronic frontier itself. He became chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Association. He led the industry\u2019s campaign to deal with the mounting competition from Japan. He was awarded the National Medal of Science in a White House ceremony in 1980. He was appointed to the University of California Board of Regents in 1982 and inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in February 1983. By now Intel\u2019s sales had grown from $64 million in 1973 to almost a billion a year. Noyce\u2019s own fortune was incalculable. (Grinnell College\u2019s $300,000 investment had multiplied in value more than thirty times, despite some sell-offs, almost doubling the college\u2019s endowment.) Noyce was hardly a famous man in the usual sense, however. He was practically unknown to the general public. But among those who followed the semiconductor industry he was a legend. He was certainly famous back east on Wall Street. When a reporter asked James Magid of the underwriting firm of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin about Noyce, he said: \u201cNoyce is a national treasure.\u201d Oh yes! What a treasure, indeed, was the moral capital of the nineteenth century! Noyce happened to grow up in a family in which the long-forgotten light of Dissenting Protestantism still burned brightly. The light!\u2014the light at the apex of every human soul! Ironically, it was that long-forgotten light ... from out of the churchy, blue-nosed sticks ... that led the world into the twenty-first century, across the electronic grid and into space. Surely the moral capital of the nineteenth century is by now all but completely spent. Robert Noyce turns fifty-six this month, and his is the last generation to have grown up in families where the light existed in anything approaching a pure state. And yet out in the Silicon Valley some sort of light shines still. People who run even the newest companies in the Valley repeat Noycisms with conviction and with relish. The young CEOs all say: \u201cDatadyne is not a corporation, it\u2019s a culture,\u201d or \u201cCybernetek is not a corporation, it\u2019s a society,\u201d or \u201cHoney Bear\u2019s assets\u201d\u2014the latest vogue is for down-home nontech names\u2014\u201cHoney Bear\u2019s assets aren\u2019t hardware, they\u2019re the software of the three thousand souls who work here.\u201d They talk about the soul and spiritual vision as if it were the most natural subject in the world for a well-run company to be concerned about. On June 8, 1983, one of the Valley\u2019s new firms, Eagle Computer, Inc., sold its stock to the public for the first time. Investors went for it like the answer to a dream. At the close of trading on the stock market, the company\u2019s forty-year-old CEO, Dennis Barnhart, was suddenly worth nine million dollars. Four and a half hours later he and a pal took his Ferrari out for a little romp, hung their hides out over the edge, lost control on a curve in Los Gatos, and went through a guardrail, and Barnhart was killed. Naturally, that night people in the business could talk of very little else. One of the best-known CEOs in the Valley said, \u201cIt\u2019s the dark side of the Force.\u201d He said it without a trace of irony, and his friends nodded in contemplation. They knew exactly what Force he meant. *Dirk Hanson, The New Alchemists (Boston: Little, Brown, 1982).","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"A weekend Truth Social post from President Donald Trump set in motion the first steps in creating a strategic U.S. bitcoin (BTC) reserve, but Polymarket traders are skeptical that it will happen within the first 100 days.  As of press time, Polymarket bettors are giving a 23% chance that a strategic BTC reserve will be created within the first 100 days of the Trump presidency \u2013 or by April 30th, 2025.   Rules of the contract say that the U.S. government will need to specifically hold bitcoin \u2013 and not from confiscation \u2013 by 11:59 PM ET on April 29 for this to resolve to yes. Announcements of the creation of a reserve do not count.  Chances of a reserve coming true spiked from 11% to 23% in the moments after Trump's announcement. Another contract that asks if a reserve will be created by the end of 2025 currently has a 65% chance of resolving to yes.  Initially, Trump's social media post announcing the creation of the reserve only named XRP and SOL as components of the reserve\u2014which caused their value to spike\u2014before clarifying that BTC and ETH would also be included in the reserve.  One of the most profitable traders of the 100-day crypto reserve contract is Theo5, which appears to be affiliated with a French trader who created a series of accounts, including Theo4, to directionally bet on Trump's victory in the November 2024 election.  Theo5 currently has posted a $40,000 profit on his no position.   Meanwhile, a trader known as Polywog lost $73,000 on their yes position and also lost over $560,000 by incorrectly betting on the outcome of the 2025 election.

President Donald Trump talks with reporters before boarding Marine One on the South Lawn of the ... [+] White House in Washington on Feb. 28. A national crypto reserve will \u201celevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks\u201d Trump said, adding he directed his administration to \u201cmove forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve\u201d that includes cryptocurrencies XRP, solana and ADA. He then added a second post saying the reserve will \u201cobviously\u201d include bitcoin and ethereum as the \u201cheart of the Reserve,\u201d saying he \u201cloves\u201d the top two cryptocurrencies. Trump\u2019s announcement Sunday builds on an executive order Trump issued Jan. 23 directing his administration to create a \u201cworking group\u201d to propose a regulatory framework on digital assets, which includes evaluating a \u201cnational digital asset stockpile.\u201d Bitcoin prices shot up more than 10% from around the time of Trump\u2019s announcement to more than $94,000 early Sunday afternoon, while ethereum prices soared more than 13% from before the announcement to briefly top $2,500 in the early afternoon. Prices for the smaller market cap coins Trump mentioned\u2014XRP, ADA and solana\u2014all spiked at least 20% shortly after Trump\u2019s announcement. It\u2019s still unclear what the final parameters of any crypto stockpile would look like, but Trump\u2019s executive order suggests the reserve would be \u201cpotentially derived\u201d from cryptocurrency the federal government has seized \u201cthrough its law enforcement efforts.\u201d The New York Times noted in January the federal government already has an estimated $19 billion in bitcoin that it\u2019s seized, which it could simply hang on to in order to establish a stockpile. The government has previously periodically sold off its crypto holdings, The Washington Post notes, which has historically then driven down crypto prices, so any efforts to just hold onto that crypto and stockpile it would prevent that from happening. What remains to be seen is whether Trump will also try to acquire significant amounts of new cryptocurrency to stock the reserves, which would likely boost the crypto industry and existing crypto holders\u2014but would also likely require congressional approval, the Times notes. While the cryptocurrency industry has cheered news of a national stockpile, some economists have raised concerns about the proposal. They point to cryptocurrency\u2019s volatility, arguing the government purchasing cryptocurrency is a gamble that would primarily benefit existing crypto holders and could ultimately result in billions\u2019 worth of taxpayer money getting wiped out, should the industry take a downturn. \u201cThere\u2019s just no discernible logic to do it,\u201d Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, told the Post in November about a national stockpile. \u201cI get why the crypto investor would love it. Other than the crypto investor, I don\u2019t see the value, particularly if taxpayers have to ante up.\u201d In addition to boosting the industry through government purchases of crypto and preventing losses from any government sell-offs, cryptocurrency advocates believe a national stockpile would also help shrink the national debt by increasing federal revenue through the growing value of the government\u2019s crypto investments. Sen. Cynthia Loomis, R-Wyo., introduced a bill in July to establish a national bitcoin stockpile in order to use the cryptocurrency as a government \u201csavings technology\u201d and way to \u201cbolster America\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d claiming to the Post the effort would \u201ccut the national debt in half.\u201d One cryptocurrency that Trump\u2019s Sunday announcement didn\u2019t name is tether, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar, though the Post reports the U.S.\u2019 seized cryptocurrency that could be used for a stockpile includes the stablecoin. That\u2019s notable because Trump\u2019s Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has ties to tether, with public reporting suggesting Cantor Fitzgerald, which Lutnick long led, helps oversee the cryptocurrency\u2019s portfolio and recently struck a deal that could result in Cantor Fitzgerald getting a 5% ownership stake in tether. Lutnick has resigned from Cantor Fitzgerald and said he will divest from it as a result of his government role, but Democrats have criticized his company\u2019s involvement with tether, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., writing in a letter to Lutnick she has \u201cserious concern[s]  Trump became a major cheerleader for the crypto industry ahead of the November election, attracting significant fundraising support from top crypto figures as he announced a suite of friendly proposals that included tackling strict regulations, calling for all remaining bitcoin to be made in the U.S. and pushing for lower interest rates. The then-candidate also pledged to create a national stockpile for crypto, saying in July when he headlined the Bitcoin Conference, \u201cFor too long our government has violated the cardinal rule that every bitcoiner knows by heart: Never sell your bitcoin.\u201d Trump even got into the cryptocurrency game himself, creating his own $TRUMP meme coin amid his inauguration. Trump\u2019s Sunday announcement about the national stockpile comes after the president has already courted the crypto industry through other moves in office, creating the position of a \u201cSpecial Advisor for AI and Crypto\u201d\u2014filled by former PayPal COO David Sacks\u2014rescinding former Biden-era crypto guidance, establishing a working group to come up with how to regulate the crypto industry and appointing well-known crypto backer Paul Atkins to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission.

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  A great shape and accurate performance make this a very comfortable mouse to use in a palm grip, things can get a little sore on the fingertips though if you play with a claw grip. The side button feel and placement make for a true contender in the MMO mouse category, but the position of the middle mouse wheel is a letdown. Responsive and easy-to-navigate side buttons Very light for an MMO mouse Very accurate Honeycomb chassis is uncomfortable in long gaming sessions The mouse wheel is too shallow in chassis making it difficult to use tilt switches Short battery life with RGB enabled  Why you can trust Tom's Hardware     Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.  I play a lot of MMOs, they are my most played genre of computer games and ever since getting my first multi-button mouse, I\u2019ve never been able to go back to a mouse with minimal buttons. Once I\u2019d tried and gotten used to the first Razer Naga, there was no returning to anything without a 12-button side panel, it\u2019s just so intuitive and useful for MMOs that often have a multitude of spells, abilities, and key binds. The Aerox 9 from SteelSeries looks to creep into the MMO mouse market and challenge the usual suspects on our list of best gaming mice with its wireless lightweight design, bright RGB colors, and functional quality construction. The Aerox 9 is a colorful MMO\/MOBA-targeted wireless mouse with a matte black chassis with honeycomb cutouts. The cutouts give it a distinct look while also helping keep the weight low. I wasn't a big fan of the cutouts, however \u2014 the cutouts flow from the rear of the mouse to the main left and right mouse buttons, and this can be rather uncomfortable if your fingers happen to rest on them for too long. I found this happening quite often if I used a claw grip. The Aerox 9 is a medium-large mouse measuring 5 inches (128mm) long, 2.6 (68mm) inches wide, and 1.6 inches (42mm) high. It weighs just 3.13 ounces (89g), which is fairly light for a mouse with so many buttons. It's a good mouse for gamers with larger hands, but if your hands are on the smaller size it could be uncomfortable. The mouse wheel is sunk into the chassis and has a low profile, which improves access for scrolling but makes using the tilt function difficult. Now for the most important part: the Aerox 9 has 18 programmable buttons, most of which are on the elongated 12-button side panel. The other buttons are the left\/right primary buttons, the tilt wheel (left, right, middle click), and the DPI switch button behind the mouse wheel.  On the bottom of the mouse, you'll find two large 100% PTFE mouse feet, plus a small PTFE circle around the sensor. This allows the mouse to freely glide around your mouse mat with minimal drag. The mouse is also touted as having an \"Aqua Barrier\" with an IP54 rating to protect its inner workings from dust, debris, and accidental drink spills (which we know all too well have dispatched a few peripherals to the bin).  In the box, you get the Aerox 9 mouse, a 6.5-foot (2m) braided USB-C to USB-A cable, a USB-C to USB-C wireless extension adapter, and the 2.4GHz wireless USB-C dongle. Sensor Model SteelSeries TrueMove Air Max Sensitivity 18,000 DPI Max Speed (IPS) 400 Max Acceleration (Gs) 40G Polling Rates 1000Hz\/1ms Programmable Buttons 18 LED Zones 3 Cable 200cm USB-A to USB-C Braided Connectivity 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, wired (USB-C) Measurements (L x W x H) 5 x 2.6 x 1.6 inches \/ 128 x 68 x 42 mm Weight (excluding cable) 3.13 oz \/ 89g MSRP \/ Price at Time of Review $149 \/ \u00a3139 I found the Aerox 9 to be highly accurate and responsive in my testing. It features the TrueMove Air sensor, which was co-developed by SteelSeries and PixArt. This sensor offers a maximum sensitivity of 18,000 DPI and a maximum speed of 400 IPS, and can handle up to 40 G's of acceleration and tilt tracking. I found the mouse performed equally well in MMO games, such as World of Warcraft, and FPS games, such as Destiny 2 and Counter-Strike 2. This was nice, as I didn't have to constantly swap mice between games. Using the SteelSeries GG software Engine I was easily able to set up multiple profiles for my favorite games, and map macros and spells to buttons with ease. The wireless worked faultlessly with no dropouts and no hint of latency. The option is there to use Bluetooth to connect as well, and it also seemed to work flawlessly, there is a higher latency on Bluetooth, but I honestly couldn\u2019t tell when using it. Primarily I kept to the 2.4GHz Quantum 2.0 wireless for the smoothest experience.  The 1000Hz polling rate and ability to tweak every setting In the software meant the mouse performed flawlessly. The responsiveness of the main and side buttons was perfect and it didn\u2019t take long to acclimatize to them from switching over from a Razer Naga Trinity. I still prefer the layout of the Razer Naga\u2019s side buttons, but I\u2019d rather have the larger and sleeker design of the Aerox 9. Yet the more I use the mouse, the more I don\u2019t miss the Naga. The only issue I did have with the Aerox 9 in regards to the performance was the positioning of the mouse wheel. I found the mouse wheel to be positioned too deep in the chassis, and as I often bind abilities to the left and right tilt switches of the mouse wheel I found I couldn\u2019t consistently access these abilities on command. Trying to force the left\/right tilt switch often led to me scrolling up and down \u2014 which I also use for separate abilities. This forced me to have to rebind and change up some key binds, which I wouldn\u2019t have had to do using a mouse with a better-positioned wheel. For me, the SteelSeries GG software is one of the best from the big peripheral manufacturers. It has a lot of features \u2014 some that have more to do with other aspects of gaming rather than the peripherals, but I\u2019ve found I like using Moments a lot (when it comes to capturing those hilarious deaths and funny moments with friends it\u2019s awesome).  All of the Aerox 9\u2019s settings are controlled in the Engine section of the SteelSeries GG software. You can control every aspect of the mouse: button assignment, sleep timer settings for battery, polling rate, sensitivity, and, of course, lighting. Here you can configure the RGB for each zone of the mouse, or disable it completely. Disabling the lighting drastically improves the battery life of the Aerox 9. SteelSeries quotes the Aerox as having a 180-hour battery life, and the mouse can certainly last that long over a Bluetooth connection. However, that figure is drastically different when you connect via 2.4GHz wireless, and is even lower with the lighting on.  In my personal testing, the Aerox 9 lasted around 20 hours with the RGB running and around twice that with it turned off while I was gaming. The good news is that the mouse recharges very quickly and notifies you with a red flash when running low; it\u2019s also easy to check the battery status in the SteelSeries GG software. There\u2019s a lot to like about the SteelSeries Aerox 9: it\u2019s the only MMO mouse I\u2019ve tried that I feel could replace my fondness for the feel of Razer\u2019s 12-button side panels on their range of Naga mice. The sensor is responsive and accurate, and the mouse has a great hand shape for sustained hours of gaming \u2014 I felt no hand or finger fatigue while using the Aerox 9 over many gaming sessions. The only downside I encountered were the honeycomb cutouts on the left and rice mouse buttons, which made the tips of my fingers a little sore when I changed to more of a claw grip in some games, and the positioning of the mouse wheel in the chassis. The 3-zone RGB and all the different lighting patterns help to make the mouse stand out on the desk and give that gamified aesthetic, but the trade-off with battery life doesn't really seem worth it to me. I ended up disabling the lighting for extended play time off of the charging cable. Stewart Bendle is a deals and coupon writer at Tom's Hardware.

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"ByBill Stone  ByBill Stone , Contributor.  Warren Buffett has an extraordinary investment track record, but would he get fired by the ... [+] short-term bias of most investors? Despite massive long-term outperformance, Berkshire Hathaway underperformed the S&P 500 one-third of the time. (Photo by Paul Morigi\/Getty Images for Fortune\/Time Inc) \u201cMistakes fade away; winners can forever blossom.\u201d \u2014 Warren Buffett Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s CEO and Chairman, writes an annual letter to provide shareholders with an owner's manual for the company and never fails to contain tremendous insights. Buffett has a unique gift for explaining complex investing topics in a digestible format. More about the long-term track record later, but Berkshire produced arguably the most remarkable extended performance for investors ever recorded. Even over a shorter period, Berkshire has significantly outperformed the S&P 500. As a rough proxy for the growth of the company\u2019s intrinsic value, the book value growth has also far outstripped the appreciation of the S&P 500. Berkshire Hathaway Performance While Buffett\u2019s letter offers countless lessons, this article will distill his annual missive into three timeless insights. Berkshire shareholders can rest assured that we will forever deploy a substantial majority of their money in equities \u2013 mostly American equities although many of these will have international operations of significance. Berkshire will never prefer ownership of cash-equivalent assets over the ownership of good businesses, whether controlled or only partially owned. \u2013 Warren Buffett While much ink has been spilled about Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s $334 billion cash hoard, Buffett noted that considering the substantial size of its wholly owned subsidiaries, most of Berkshire\u2019s investments remain in equities. To quote Buffett directly, \u201cDespite what some commentators currently view as an extraordinary cash position at Berkshire, the great majority of your money remains in equities. That preference won\u2019t change. While our ownership in marketable equities moved downward last year from $354 billion to $272 billion, the value of our non-quoted controlled equities increased somewhat and remains far greater than the value of the marketable portfolio.\u201d While his comments are accurate, the cash levels relative to Berkshire's asset size are at an all-time high as far back as Bloomberg data exists. Using Berkshire\u2019s market capitalization and some other minor adjustments as a proxy to capture the value of its wholly owned companies, cash levels are high but below mid-2005. Berkshire Hathaway: Cash Level Buffett makes the case that holding cash or bonds is not a good protection against inflation, as \u201cPaper money can see its value evaporate if fiscal folly prevails. In some countries, this reckless practice has become habitual, and, in our country\u2019s short history, the U.S. has come close to the edge. Fixed-coupon bonds provide no protection against runaway currency.\u201d Instead, he notes that good businesses with pricing power can adapt to inflation by saying, \u201cBusinesses, as well as individuals with desired talents, however, will usually find a way to cope with monetary instability as long as their goods or services are desired by the country\u2019s citizenry.\u201d Long-term historical data returns across asset classes from 1928 to 2023 show that business ownership via stocks provided the highest annualized returns on both a nominal and real basis. These real, after-inflation returns are essential to maintaining and growing purchasing power. Buffett\u2019s preference for owning good companies rather than cash becomes clear when one compares stock returns to cash equivalent assets, which has provided a more consistent but lower nominal return but has had a barely positive after-inflation return. Once taxes and expenses are considered, cash holdings, though more stable, have eroded purchasing power over time. Long-Term Annualized Returns: 1928-2023 He also explained the secret of owning stocks when he said, \u201cUnderstandably, really outstanding businesses are very seldom offered in their entirety, but small fractions of these gems can be purchased Monday through Friday on Wall Street and, very occasionally, they sell at bargain prices.\u201d It seems Buffett\u2019s relatively large cash holding can be attributed to a lack of \u201ccompelling\u201d opportunities. Buffett notes, \u201cWe are impartial in our choice of equity vehicles, investing in either variety based upon where we can best deploy your (and my family\u2019s) savings. Often, nothing looks compelling; very infrequently, we find ourselves knee-deep in opportunities.\u201d Some of Benjamin Graham\u2019s investment philosophies, as outlined in \u201cThe Intelligent Investor\u201d book, remain the bedrock of Buffett\u2019s investment process. Graham thought investors should look at stock holdings as owning a part of various businesses, like being a \u201csilent partner\u201d in a private company. Hence, stocks should be valued as a portion of the company\u2019s intrinsic value, not as something with a constantly changing price on the stock market. An investor should take advantage of the stock market\u2019s erratic view of a company rather than allowing it to dictate what one should do. Valuing stocks as a business and purchasing stock with a \u201cmargin of safety\u201d enable investors to ignore the market\u2019s manic or depressive states. For Graham, the \u201cmargin of safety\u201d meant buying at a price below the \u201cindicated or appraised value,\u201d which should allow an investment to provide a reasonable return even if there are errors in the analysis. Sixty years ago, present management took control of Berkshire. That move was a mistake \u2013 my mistake \u2013 and one that plagued us for two decades. Charlie, I should emphasize, spotted my obvious error immediately: Though the price I paid for Berkshire looked cheap, its business \u2013 a large northern textile operation \u2013 was headed for extinction. \u2013 Warren Buffett Berkshire Hathaway would not be a household name without a momentous capital allocation decision early in Buffett\u2019s leadership. In the mid-1960s, Buffett acquired control of Berkshire Hathaway, a New England textile company making suit linings. Instead of reinvesting in the sub-par textile business, he took the cash generated by it to invest in better businesses, including Geico. The textile business was shuttered in 1985. Buffett gives Charlie Munger credit for convincing him to allocate to \u201cwonderful businesses\u201d rather than invest or reinvest in challenged businesses even though they are cheap. As Buffett says now, \u201cTime is the friend of a wonderful business, the enemy of the mediocre.\u201d Buffett reiterated the importance of capital allocation decisions in this year\u2019s letter: \"Sometimes, I\u2019ve made mistakes in assessing the future economics of a business I\u2019ve purchased for Berkshire \u2013 each a case of capital allocation gone wrong. That happens with both judgments about marketable equities \u2013 we view these as partial ownership of businesses \u2013 and the 100% acquisitions of companies.\u201d He spent considerable space in the letter discussing Berkshire\u2019s insurance business, which has some unique characteristics compared to typical companies. Part of the discussion involved capital allocation to the insurance business: \u201cWe must never write inadequately-priced policies in order to stay in the game. That policy is corporate suicide.\u201d Warren Buffett and, in the past, Charlie Munger have often spoken about the powerful force of incentives and being mindful of them when making decisions and compensation agreements. Buffett spoke to Berkshire\u2019s alignment of incentives between the management and shareholders: \u201cMoreover, Greg (Abel), our directors and I all have a very large investment in Berkshire in relation to any compensation we receive. We do not use options or other one-sided forms of compensation; if you lose money, so do we. This approach encourages caution but does not ensure foresight.\u201d He told the story of negotiating to buy Forest River, a recreational vehicle manufacturer, from the late Pete Liegl. Liegl continued to manage Forest River after selling to Berkshire until he passed away last year. Liegl negotiated an annual salary of $100,000, equal to Buffett\u2019s salary, and an annual bonus of 10% of any earnings beyond what the company was earning at the time of the sale. Buffett added this to the compensation agreement: \u201cOK Pete, but if Forest River makes any significant acquisitions we will make an appropriate adjustment for the additional capital thus employed.\u201d This added adjustment wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t trust Liegl or Buffett wouldn\u2019t have done business with him, but rather to align the incentives of profit growth with the cost of capital expenditures. The world is overwhelmingly short-term focused. I mean, that is a world made to order for anybody that\u2019s trying to think about what you do that should work over 5, or 10, or 20 years. \u2013 Warren Buffett at the 2023 annual meeting Since Buffett began operating Berkshire in 1965, the stock has risen at an annualized pace of 19.9%. By contrast, the S&P 500 has had an annualized return of 10.4% during the same timeframe. Annualized Total Returns (1965-2024) Using annualized percentages doesn\u2019t do Berkshire Hathaway's outperformance justice. An investment of $10,000 in Berkshire Hathaway at the beginning of Buffett\u2019s tenure would now be worth over $550 million. An investment in the S&P 500 would be worth over $3.9 million, which is overstated since it includes the reinvestment of dividends but no adjustment for expenses and taxes. Berkshire Hathaway: Value Of $10,000 Despite its fantastic track record of performance, Buffett admitted some mistakes among his company purchases, \u201cWe own nothing that is a major drag, but we have a number that I should not have purchased.\u201d Even with the enviable long-term performance, the combination of fallible decision-making and occasionally being out of sync with the markets has caused Berkshire Hathaway to underperform the S&P 500 more often than most would expect. For example, the return on Berkshire has trailed the S&P 500 for a full one-third of the calendar years. Looking at rolling three-year calendar years, Berkshire has underperformed a surprising 28% of the time, considering the exceptional long-term outperformance. Berkshire Hathaway: Percentage Of Underperforming Periods Versus S&P 500 (1965-2024) The chart of this rolling three-calendar-year performance underscores how easy it would have been for some investors to think Warren Buffett had sometimes lost his touch, sold the stock, and missed out on Berkshire Hathaway's historic and breathtaking long-term performance. Berkshire Hathaway: 3 Year Rolling Annualized Performance (1965-2024) Many institutional and private investors still use the 3-year relative performance of their investment managers to make hire and fire decisions, even though it has been proven not to work for deciding whether to fire Warren Buffett by selling Berkshire Hathway or choose another investment manager. Despite being a net seller of publicly traded stocks over the last nine quarters in a row, Berkshire did make a new purchase, Constellation Brands (STZ), according to the 13F filing with the SEC, released on February 14. The filing provides more details of the publicly traded stock portfolio changes. The insurance business was the primary driver of robust positive operating earnings growth in 2024, but even operating income growth excluding insurance hit double-digits. This was all despite 53% of Berkshire\u2019s 189 operating companies seeing earnings declines in 2024. While the letters have generally become shorter recently, Warren Buffett never disappoints with his annual letter as Buffett is a master teacher and investment genius. He reinforces the timeless lessons with new illustrations and occasionally unveils something new in his bag of tricks. While none of the concepts discussed are new, Buffett reinforced insights relevant to the current state of investing, particularly Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s insurance business. The next major update will be in early May, when many of us will make our annual pilgrimage to Omaha to attend the annual meeting, otherwise known as the Woodstock for Capitalists.

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"  Home > Opinion Articles >                          Aggressive pricing led to Amazon's Fire TV Stick being installed in millions of homes. By tearing down a key barrier to entry, Amazon hoped to profit from subsequent sales of premium content. Two decades earlier, Jeff Bezos stressed the importance of strong branding to fend off copycats. In 2023, that theory would be put to the test when one of Amazon's strongest brands was dumped in mud, then dragged through it for the next 18 months.              On a Saturday afternoon when everything runs to plan, the referee blows his whistle and for the next 105 minutes, nothing matters more than this game in this magnificent stadium. Yet, viewed from almost any other vantage point, top tier professional football faces problems in every direction. At the Financial Times\u2019 Business of Football Summit on Wednesday, DAZN\u2019s head of global rights Tom Burrows spoke of the sports rights industry \u201cgetting to the stage where it\u2019s almost a crisis.\u201d Coming from a company that has already spent billions on TV rights and plans to spend billions more, \u201ccrisis\u201d takes a different shape when considering the \u00a38.7 billion deficit in DAZN\u2019s latest set of accounts. Broadcasting rights are necessary but, as costs cascade from rightsholders to broadcasters and ultimately down to the fans, prohibitively high prices eliminate loyal fans from the top-tier football business equation. At a time of \u201calmost crisis\u201d when the majority of clubs continue to report losses, ideally fans should be traveling in the other direction.  Unsustainable business models have a direct effect on fans\u2019 ability to financially support the game. At clubs around Europe, the cause of today\u2019s crisis is clear, and something on which they all agree: the root of the industry\u2019s woes is rampant online piracy. What caused piracy to run rampant in the first place is rarely discussed. Fans, on the other hand, consistently cite the same motivations to pirate, year in and year out. Expecting fans to comply with the law is not unreasonable but, since prevention is better than cure, shaping public perceptions in advance is also an option for rightsholders. In Italy, public awareness campaigns are a legal requirement but, with so many moving parts, whether these efforts make much difference is up for debate. Even if an awareness campaign moved an entire nation to tears, a couple of 30-second videos are no basis for the scale and persistence of change the situation demands. According to the FT report, the piracy situation in the UK is \u201cnot believed to be as bad\u201d as those faced in Spain, Italy, France, and Germany. Sky Group COO Nick Herm nevertheless spoke this week of a \u201cnever-ending battle\u201d, while initially declining to put a figure on the cost to the business.  When asked to estimate how much piracy costs the business, Herm said it was difficult to quantify as very few people are willing to admit accessing pirated content. He nevertheless added that \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d go \u2018missing\u2019 from the company\u2019s revenue streams due to piracy. An estimate in the low hundreds seems to fit the bigger picture. Determining the nature of this \u2018gray\u2019 audience would help to separate potential lost sales from the folly of chasing lost causes. From any UK vantage point outside a Premier League stadium mid-Saturday afternoon, matches are unavailable to view live, at any price. The \u20183pm blackout\u2019 is regularly cited as a prime reason for fans turning to illegal streams. When the Premier League broadcasts 3pm games and every other game in countries including Canada, the prices are significantly lower than those available to fans in the UK, for a more restricted content offering. UK fans clearly have an issue with that, but the bigger question is whether the policy contributes to overall piracy. When the Premier League denies access to live broadcasts of some of the most significant games, that creates demand for a highly desirable product that doesn\u2019t exist in the UK. This not only acts as an incentive to supply pirated content to an underserved market, but also provides the conditions for profit. People have spent time in prison in the UK for fulfilling that demand. And since pirate IPTV packages aren\u2019t only available for use on Saturdays, those who \u2018beat the blackout\u2019 have zero incentive to maintain any legal package for viewing during the week. Crafting an awareness campaign to mitigate the Canadian example above would face obvious hurdles, yet with decades of experience, probably not impossible for a company like Sky. The BeStreamWise anti-piracy campaign involving Sky, Premier League, BBC, ITV, DAZN, and others, launched in September 2023.  The campaign\u2019s focus on malware provided no specific advice. With no security vendors on board to add credibility to its claims, any awareness raised seemed limited to the claims, not the underlying threats. None of the threats were publicly named for awareness or avoidance purposes, but it didn\u2019t take long for an innocent sore thumb to stand out as a possible scapegoat. Amazon\u2019s Fire TV Stick hit the market in 2014 and was soon recognized as the cheapest way to transform an existing dumb TV into something smarter. Amazon was happy to see its competitors\u2019 products competing alongside its own on Fire TV. Streaming market leader Netflix went head-to-head with Prime Video, while Spotify jostled for business against Amazon Music, for example.  Reportedly sold close to cost to maximize sales, Fire TV Sticks lowered the barrier to entry for legal consumption of movies, TV shows, music, and apps.  Yet, in common with most Android-based devices on the market, Fire Sticks were capable of a much more. Since they were comparatively cheap, well-made and in constant supply, Fire Sticks became the go-to device for pirates and non-pirates alike. At a time when Amazon held the rights to show a limited number of live Premier League matches, and was gifting them to Prime customers for no additional cost, the demonization of \u2018firesticks\u2019 stepped up a gear. With plenty of assistance from elements of the UK tabloid media, an entirely legal Amazon product found itself elevated to pirate boogeyman status. DANGER: LEGAL STREAMING     In what would become a recurring theme, public warnings concerning piracy found themselves coupled with serious but non-specific malware threats. Then by coincidence or design, references to Fire TV Stick-based devices and even Amazon itself became embroiled in the ongoing controversy. That Amazon\u2019s valuable brand had become synonymous with piracy was countered in some articles with a note that \u201c\u2018firesticks\u2019 aren\u2019t illegal in their own right\u201d and only jailbreaking is illegal. There has never been a requirement to jailbreak Fire TV Sticks. Sideloading apps from repositories outside Amazon\u2019s ecosystem was always straightforward via a toggle in the device\u2019s menu. And herein lies the problem. TF became aware of a potential mismatch between rightsholders expectations and Amazon\u2019s right to run its own business over a year ago. In general terms, it was felt that the success of the Fire TV Stick meant that Amazon should consider the positive impact of taking some type of action. A logical assumption might see sideloading prevented, for example, but that would be easily fixed and might also prevent legal use of legal apps. At the Business of Football Summit on Wednesday, details emerged of why a legal device is considered such a threat, and details of the measures requested and subsequently denied by Amazon. Sky Group COO Nick Herm revealed that \u2018jailbroken Fire Sticks\u2019 represent the #1 piracy threat in the UK, with Amazon branding playing a leading role. \u201cThe Amazon FireStick is a big problem here,\u201d Herm said. \u201cWe think it accounts for about half of the piracy in the UK. People think that because it\u2019s a legitimate brand, it must be OK. So they give their credit card details to criminal gangs. Amazon is not engaging with us as much as we\u2019d like.\u201d Rightsholders reportedly asked Amazon to prevent sideloading of third party apps or impose restrictions on functionality for software originating from outside its ecosystem. Other problems include customers buying firesticks in bulk, with rightsholders arguing in favor of restrictions on sales.  Other issues may have drawn inspiration from Sky\u2019s anti-piracy awareness and enforcement campaigns in Ireland.  \u201cThere are football fans who literally have shirts printed out that say Fire Sticks on them,\u201d Herm said.  Biting the hand that feeds     With fans apparently turning up at games dressed in shirts like these, and even getting snapped on TV, websites appear to be cashing in too.  Perhaps one shouldn\u2019t take these things so seriously, but this is Ireland\u2019s national team strip. The team is sponsored by Sky but clearly its logo has been replaced here for comic effect with limited shelf life. Genuine shirts are available from Sky for just \u20ac91, confirming that this is one big joke that isn\u2019t funny at all. The answer to both questions is the same: we don\u2019t know. Mentions of an \u201calmost crisis\u201d and calling out Amazon in public suggest that not enough progress has been made on the piracy front. Whether the BeStreamWise campaign was a success or not, seems to depend on its purpose. If the main goal was to reduce consumption of pirated content, we don\u2019t know. If the point was to raise awareness, we can\u2019t say for certain either way. The Google Trends chart below shows the popularity of searches for \u201cfiresticks\u201d and \u201cmalware\u201d during the course of the campaign. While unlikely to provide much insight, these entirely separate searches may offer a surprise. When searches for \u201cfiresticks\u201d peak, searches for \u201cmalware\u201d have a tendency to reduce at exactly the same time.       Another unexpected outcome is outlined below. Lack of information to support the claims in the BeStreamWise campaign motivated us to find out more about the intersection of piracy and malware. Scores of hours were subsequently spent tearing apart popular and unpopular pirate streaming apps, mostly on Android but some on iOS, to find out if the bare claims made in the campaign are substantially true. While some apps may be completely benign, nearly all apps randomly tested generated money from ads, and not necessarily good ones. Many apps were wide open to specific exploits so glaring, the question of intent seems more pressing than one of incompetence. Permissions appear to be an area of real concern; broad requests for permission to access deep into user devices should be denied by default, not willingly accepted without a second thought as appears to be the case here. Other \u2018useful\u2019 features discovered include the ability to silently turn on cameras and microphones without alerting the user, while extracting photo albums to servers linked to facial recognition services.  A baked-in capability to do almost anything with users\u2019 devices, wherever and whenever that\u2019s required, may not directly evoke the church scene in Kingsman, but as an awareness campaign, money in the bank.

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"ByRobert Rapier  ByRobert Rapier , Senior Contributor.  CEDAR CREEK, TEXAS - DECEMBER 30: In an aerial view, the Bastrop Energy Center Power Plant is seen ... [+] on December 30, 2024 in Cedar Creek, Texas. Natural gas futures sharply soared as a looming cold front swept across key consumption regions of the United States in January.  (Photo by Brandon Bell\/Getty Images) Natural gas prices recently soared to their highest levels in two years, driven by a combination of extreme weather, supply constraints, record liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, and global demand pressures. This surge has significant implications for consumers, industries, and energy markets worldwide. Arctic conditions across North America and Europe have dramatically increased heating demand, leading to higher natural gas consumption. Extreme cold has also triggered production challenges, such as \u201cfreeze-offs,\u201d where frigid temperatures disrupt wellhead operations, temporarily halting gas extraction. At the same time, lower-than-average wind speeds have reduced renewable energy output, increasing reliance on natural gas to compensate for the shortfall. The harsh winter conditions have led to heavier-than-usual withdrawals from underground storage facilities, pushing inventories below the five-year average. Reduced supply levels have fueled price volatility, as traders anticipate potential shortages in the months ahead. Historically, when underground storage levels fall below the five-year average, prices rise, and vice-versa. Note that inventory levels in the graphic below are 23% below the levels of a year ago, when inventories were at the top of the five-year range and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices were below $2 per million Btu. Working Gas in Underground Storage Meanwhile, natural gas production has faced additional disruptions. Freeze-offs in key production regions have constrained output, exacerbating concerns about supply tightness. These challenges, combined with heightened demand, have put upward pressure on prices. The U.S. has reached record LNG export levels, with 2024 shipments averaging nearly 12 billion cubic feet per day. The global appetite for LNG continues to grow, as European and Asian buyers compete for available supply in response to geopolitical instability and reduced Russian gas flows to Europe. As more U.S. natural gas is sent overseas, domestic markets face added pressure, reducing available supply and further supporting price increases. This trend highlights the interconnected nature of global energy markets, where domestic prices are increasingly influenced by international demand. Rising demand in Europe and Asia is another key driver of natural gas price volatility. Since the reduction of Russian gas supplies to Europe, many nations have turned to LNG imports to fill the gap, creating intense competition for available cargoes. In Asia, economic recovery and seasonal heating demand have further tightened the market. Geopolitical tensions also continue to impact global supply chains. Any disruption in LNG shipping routes or export facilities could send prices even higher, making market participants increasingly sensitive to political developments. Higher-than-average withdrawals from storage facilities have depleted inventories in both the U.S. and Europe, reinforcing concerns about supply shortages. With current stockpiles running lower than normal, replenishing inventories could take longer than usual, particularly if winter conditions persist or production remains constrained. Looking ahead, the combination of strong demand, tight supply, and geopolitical risks suggests continued price support for natural gas. Weather forecasts will play a crucial role in determining short-term price movements, while global LNG trade patterns and geopolitical developments will influence long-term market dynamics. For investors and market participants, closely monitoring storage data, production trends, and international LNG flows will be critical in navigating the natural gas landscape.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"Wooden Planes is a monthly newsletter that tells the stories behind history's most iconic hand tool. No gimmicks, no sales, no AI slop. Just good stories. Here's what readers are saying. The pages of A Guide to American Wooden Planes are filled with the biographies of planemakers who worked in wildly varying professions, from music teachers to mail clerks. But I know of no other planemaker with a resume like Ebenezer Clifford, architect, master joiner, bell diver, cabinetmaker, turner, justice of the peace, and quartermaster sergeant in the Revolutionary War. Born on Oct. 29, 1746 into a family of carpenters, Clifford lived the first half of his life in Kensington, New Hampshire. By the time he was in his 20s, he was likely a well-known joiner. A paneled room he is said to have built in 1774 was eventually purchased by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, dismantled, and displayed in its American Wing. (The New York Times called it \u201cone of the best examples of early American paneling in existence.\u201d) At the outbreak of the Revolutionary War in 1775, he enlisted in the 2nd New Hampshire Regiment and possibly took part in the siege of Boston. He served as quartermaster sergeant until he left the army in 1777. 1 When he got home, he went straight back to work as a joiner. In 1777, he built a staircase for a Deerfield farmer, charging \u00a31-8-0 for his time, another \u00a32-9-0 for \u201cmy servt\u201d (likely an apprentice), and another \u00a31-11-0 for turning 31 balusters. Clifford bought two \u201cCornish [crown molding] irons\u201d and a \u201cCornish bed mold Plain Iron\u201d in 1784 when he worked as a joiner on the stair hall in the Governor John Langdon Mansion. (He served as a justice of the peace for Rockingham Co., Mass. that same year.) The volume of wood he was purchasing at the time \u2014 \u201c1,600 board feet of cherry, 900 feet of maple, and 900 feet of birch\u201d in 1788 and 1789 \u2014 speaks to his output as a cabinetmaker. In 1788, he sold a \u201cCherrytree\u201d clock case, a \u201cMahogany Stand Table,\u201d six chairs, and an 18-inch \u201cMahogany Teaboard.\u201d His surviving planes are all from this time period. A local blacksmith\u2019s account books shows him buying more than 200 plane irons between 1772 and 1794.2 Clifford moved to Exeter, New Hampshire, in 1793, and began focusing on more than construction. (His personal library at the time included architectural books like the 1756 edition of Plans, Elevations, And Sections, Of Noblemen And Gentlemen\u2019s Houses.) He designed, or co-designed with builder-architect Bradbury Johnson, a number of buildings that still stand. They both worked as master joiners for the Phillips Exeter Academy in 1794, with Clifford being paid \u00a3234-16-11. Clifford designed the building and Johnson designed the cupola. Both men are credited with planning the Congregational Church in Exeter in 1798. Either Johnson or Clifford worked as the master joiner for the Samuel Tenney House in 1800. The only known building whose design can be solely credited to Clifford is the Atkinson Academy, built in 1803 when he was 57 years old.3 It was around this time Clifford\u2019s interests turned to sub-marine exploration. He used a diving bell to salvage silver coins from a shipwreck at the Isles of Shoals, about six miles off the coast of New Hampshire in the Atlantic Ocean. It\u2019s unknown what vessel the coins came from, but the money had been submerged long enough that it was encrusted with marine life. In 1803, Clifford and Richard Tripe of Dover tried to raise a sunken gundalow (a type of sailing barge) on the Piscataqua River. They made 12 dives in their bell, attaching cables to the hull of the barge in 72 feet of water. Unfortunately, a ship collided with the cables, shattering the barge\u2019s hull. 4 The salvage was a failure; they were only able to bring up a few iron bars from the ship\u2019s cargo. But Clifford enjoyed his time underwater. His chronic rheumatism was so improved by the increased pressure at the bottom of the river that he was able to walk six miles after a dive. The bell was 5-feet 9-inches tall and 5 feet across at the base, with two seats and a footrest made from an anchor. With their signal buoy \u2014\u00a0a full-size hand-carved wooden swan \u2014\u00a0floating above them, the men were slowly lowered to the bottom over the course of 20 minutes. As they probed the river bottom, fish gathered around them like \u201ca flock of chickens.\u201d 5 In 1808, Clifford and Samuel Palmer of Milton received permission from the state of Massachusetts to conduct salvage operations on the Penobscot River where the British had sunk 44 American ships during the Revolutionary War. Palmer was no stranger to diving bells. He had unsuccessfully tried to raise sunken cargo in the Portsmouth River and a lake. Over the next few years, they retrieved \u201c36 pieces of cannon, a brass howitzer, and several tons of cannon balls.\u201d In 1810, the state paid the men $2,078.84 for the metal (about $53,700 today). 6 When Clifford began working on the Penobscot River, Tripe, his original diving partner, sued. Tripe had received a patent (Improvements in Diving Machines, #681) on April 1, 1806, for an apparatus that provided air to a diving bell. In his lawsuit, he claimed Clifford had used his invention. The outcome of the case is unknown. Confusingly, a story ran in the Boston Centinel in 1810 (and was subsequently reprinted in newspapers in Pennsylvania, Maryland and North Carolina) crediting Clifford, not Tripe, for having \u201cinvented an improved [and] ingenious Diving Bell, of a new construction.\u201d Clifford may have been involved with salvage efforts after 1810. An 1811 article in a New York City newspaper described ongoing work by a \u201cMr. Palmer\u201d and \u201cthe company who own the Diving Bell\u201d to raise parts of the wrecked British frigate Hussar in the East River.7 Following several years of declining health, Clifford died on October 10, 1821, at the age of 74. A state legislator recalled his father attending an auction in 1878 at the old Clifford home \u201cwhen the last of the fourth generation of cabinetmakers sold the place.\u201d His account includes this heartbreaking detail: \u201cA farmer bought their old planes and tools for firewood, many of them then over 100 years old \u2014 he had to go twice with a two horse wagon to haul them home.\u201d8  This is the first time I\u2019ve seen this kind of decoration on a plane, and I\u2019d love to know if anyone has ever spotted something similar. (You can reply to this email or find other ways to contact me here.) It was made by the Ohio Tool Co., with a G. Baurmann, Louisville, Kentucky mark. I don\u2019t believe Ohio Tool ever offered a plane with brass decorations, so I assume it was put on by Baurmann. Gustave Baurmann (1817-1884) was a Louisville, Kentucky, hardware, cutlery, and gun dealer. He was born in Prussia and immigrated to the United States as a young man. He was part of several hardware partnerships, eventually opening his own business \u2014 G. Baurmann & Co. \u2014 in 1854. After the end of the Civil War, Baurmann hired local architect Henry Whitestone to design a store for him at 741 West Main St., as well as a spacious 14-room home on Market St. In 1870, he owned $40,765 worth of property in the city. Louisville was home to a large German community in the 1800s. Baurmann took an active part in it, including serving as the treasurer for the local opera house. He sold his business to Harvey, Girdler & Co. in 1872; two years later he put his house up for sale and traveled to Europe. The 1880 federal census lists six Baurmann children, three girls and three boys, aged 9-20. Baurmann died in 1884 and is buried in Louisville\u2019s Cave Hill Cemetery.

{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"  Many Trekkies have watched every episode of every \"Star Trek\" show to have aired since the franchise's inception in 1966. That's 900-some episode in total, so it takes a lot of commitment to stay abreast of the whole property. Deep-cut Trekkies, however, have not only seen all 900-some episodes, but have also studied sourcebooks, comics, and oral histories, trying to know as much about the show as possible. The next time you're with a Trekkie friend, ask to see their copy of Larry Nemecek's \"The Star Trek The Next Generation Companion\" or Rick Sternbach and Mike Okuda's \"Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual.\" I assure you, they have those books. They are required reading on the \"Star Trek\" syllabus. Deep-cut Trekkies may also be familiar with the hundreds and hundreds of sanctioned \u2014 but non-canonical \u2014 \"Star Trek\" novels that have been published over the years. \"Star Trek\" tie-in novels, for neophytes, feature established \"Star Trek\" characters, but engage in new, speculative adventures. The novels are written by a special raft of authors who are given a series of rules to follow, and most of the books, like the TV shows, return all their characters to the status quo by the end ... for the most part.\u00a0\"Star Trek\" novel enthusiasts may even have their favorite authors; Peter David tends to write more playful \"Star Trek\" stories, for instance. John Vornholt, Michael Jan Friedman, and Diane Duane might also be familiar to Trekkish bibliophiles. For more on that,\u00a0check out \/FIlm's rundown of the best \"Star Trek\" books on the (second hard) market. Diane Carey, meanwhile, is one of the more prolific \"Star Trek\" authors ... although not one that, it seems, who is universally beloved by those who've worked on the franchise. In fact, \"Star Trek: Enterprise\" co-creator Brannon Braga once said on one of the show's Blu-ray special features (as transcribed on a \"Star Trek\" BBS) that Carey manhandled his teleplay for \"Broken Bow,\" the \"Enterprise\" pilot episode. Carey clearly didn't like Braga's teleplay, so she slipped in a few acidic commentaries. Braga noticed.   Carey, it should be noted, had already authored 28 \"Star Trek\" novels when her novelization of \"Broken Bow\" was published in 2001. She had penned tie-ins to all four live-action \"Star Trek\" shows up to that point and had a deep understanding of the franchise. I should pause to clarify that while the bulk of \"Star Trek\" tie-in novels are original stories, a small handful of them are straight-up novelizations of notable extant \"Star Trek\" episodes. Carey\u00a0was one of the go-to authors of straightforward episode adaptations, having been hired by Pocket Books to hype up the bigger \"Star Trek\" TV events. \"Broken Bow\" was her 10th novelization. Braga, himself one of the \"Star Trek\" franchise's most respected writers, hated it. Carey, he argued, added snarky asides that specifically criticized his writing. Speaking about the novel with his\u00a0\"Enterprise\" co-creator Rick Berman, Braga explained how much he hated it: \"Do you remember ... the novelization of the 'Enterprise' pilot, in hardcover? That came out around the time the show did, by Diane Carey that ... It was very obvious in reading many passages that she hated the pilot script and was making her own meta-commentary on the show? Do you remember this? [...] It's filled with passages commenting on how s***ty the script is. You know, like ... I can't remember exactly, but you know: 'So, Trip and Reed found themselves in front of two stripper girls eating butterflies. A ridiculous concept, even on an alien world.' I mean, just like ...\" This refers to a scene in \"Broken Bow\" where Trip Tucker (Connor Trinneer) and Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating) visit an outpost on Rigel X. There, they spot an alien burlesque performance involving two alien women seductively using their elongated tongues to eat butterflies out of the air. Braga wrote the scene. Carey clearly hated it and got to say so. Braga got pissed.   Berman, listening to Braga, couldn't quite believe it, so Braga continued. There were a lot of little nitpicks in Carey's novel, so Braga paraphrased Carey's work, saying: \"This was in the novelization. And just, like, commenting on how stupid characters were: 'No good Starfleet captain would have done this, but Captain Archer was no ordinary 'Star Trek' captain.' But, it was filled ... and I don't know if it was you or me called just to say, 'Hey, we think this is funny, but you should know that this author has [ill will for you].' [...] Obviously, an editor missed the fact that she hates the show, and it's reeking with hatred from beginning to end. I don't know or remember exactly what happened. I think maybe she was reprimanded.\" The two \"Enterprise\" creators were familiar enough with Carey's work to have noticed patterns emerging in her style. They noted that in her \"Deep Space Nine\" novelizations, she gave Captain Sisko (who is unique among \"Star Trek\" captains) interior monologues wherein he expressed contempt for his fellow officers, disgusted by their actions and dialogue. This was dialogue, of course, penned by a hard-working TV writer somewhere. Carey was clearly inserting her own reviews of the episodes she was adapting. Most Trekkies might have noticed Carey's editorials and felt they were legitimate; fresh perspectives are welcome, and Carey merely got to offer her take on a (perhaps clunky) scene. The original episode writers, however, had every right to be upset. It's unclear if Carey was ever reprimanded, but one may notice that she authored no additional \"Star Trek\" novels after 2001. In 2003, however, she wrote the adaptation of the film \"S.W.A.T.\" before going on to write two novels based on \"Aliens\" in the mid-2000s. She has also written three original novels, all her own.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-02","content":"This year's nominees include Demi Moore, Cynthia Erivo and Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n. The 2025 Oscars are here and just ahead of Hollywood's biggest night, we're taking a look at all the best actress nominees. This year's best actress nominees include Cynthia Erivo, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n, Mikey Madison, Demi Moore and Fernanda Torres. The 97th Oscars will take place Sunday, March 2, at 7 p.m. ET\/4 p.m. PT at the Dolby Theatre at Ovation Hollywood. The ceremony will be televised on ABC and stream live on Hulu for the first time. Read more about each best actress nominee below. Erivo earned her best actress nomination for her portrayal of Elphaba Thropp in director Jon M. Chu's film adaptation of the musical, \"Wicked,\" based on Gregory Maguire's 1995 book \"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West.\" The 1995 book was inspired by L. Frank Baum's 1900 novel \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\" Erivo starred alongside Ariana Grande's Glinda in the 10-time Oscar nominated film, which explored the complex friendship between the two witches. Since \"Wicked's\" release, Erivo's epic battle cry riff at the end of the film during the iconic song, \"Defying Gravity,\" has gone viral on social media and her performances has been praised by critics and fans alike. Erivo has also received nominations for several awards, including a Golden Globe for best performance by a female actor in a motion picture -- musical or comedy, a Critics Choice Award for best actress, a BAFTA award for leading actress and Screen Actors Guild Award for outstanding performance by a female actor in a leading role. At the National Board of Review Gala in January, Erivo told \"Good Morning America\" about how much Elphaba means to her: \"She's always gonna be in my heart, I don't think she's ever gonna go anywhere. But I kind of like that.\" Gasc\u00f3n made history for being the first openly trans actor to earn an Oscar nomination for her performance in \"Emilia P\u00e9rez.\" The actress played Emilia P\u00e9rez, a Mexican drug cartel leader, who with the help of a lawyer played by Zoe Salda\u00f1a, fakes her death and undergoes gender-affirming surgery. Emilia attempts to right the wrongs of her past years later and reconnect with her former wife, played by Selena Gomez, and her children. The film has taken home major wins at several awards shows this season, including four Golden Globe Awards and three Critics Choice Awards. It is also the most-nominated film at this year's Oscars with 13 nominations. But it hasn't been without controversy. Some have taken issue with the film's portrayal of the trans community, which critics and LGBTQ advocates, including GLAAD, have called harmful and \"a step backward for trans representation.\" Director Jacques Audiard has also faced criticism for topics related to the film, including his previous comments of Spanish language and his depiction of Mexican cartels and their victims in the film, among other topics. Despite the mixed reaction to the film, Gasc\u00f3n has already won several awards for her performance. At the Cannes Film Festival in 2024, she earned the best actress award along with her co-stars Selena Gomez, Adriana Paz and Zoe Salda\u00f1a. Gasc\u00f3n was also nominated for a Golden Globe, a Critics Choice Award for best actress and a Screen Actors Guild Award for outstanding performance by a female actor in a leading role. However, the conversation around the film drastically shifted when many of Gasc\u00f3n's past tweets, which spanned several years and were written in Spanish, were brought to light in January. In them, she took aim at Islam, calling the religion \"INCOMPATIBLE with Western values,\" Oscar's diversity, China's involvement in the coronavirus pandemic and the 2020 death of George Floyd. Since her tweets resurfaced, Gasc\u00f3n has deactivated her X account and apologized. The director addressed Gasc\u00f3n's tweets in an interview with Deadline earlier this month and called her past comments \"inexcusable\" and said that she needs to \"take accountability for her actions.\" Gasc\u00f3n responded to Audiard's comments and vowed to stay silent \"to allow the film to be appreciated for what it is.\" Madison's performance as Ani, a young sex worker, in the Sean Baker-directed film \"Anora,\" also earned her her first Oscar nomination. In the film, Ani gets her chance at a Cinderella story when she meets and impulsively marries the son of an oligarch. Her fairytale ending crumbles when her husband's parents set out to get the marriage annulled. The role earned Madison a Critics Choice Award nomination, Golden Globe nomination and a BAFTA Award nomination. Madison described how the role of Ani has changed her life while speaking to \"Good Morning America\" at the National Board of Review Gala in January. \"I think it really evolved the way that I work as an artist and how I want to approach future projects or characters in the future,\" she said. The film sparked conversation when Madison revealed in Variety's \"Actors on Actors\" conversation with Pamela Anderson that she was offered an intimacy coordinator but declined the use of one on set during her explicit nudity and sex scenes, because she and her co-star, Mark Eydelshteyn, \"wanted to keep it small\" with director Sean Baker and Baker's wife, Sammy Kwan, who was a producer on the film. \"I think we were able to just really streamline it, shoot it super quickly and there are less sex scenes, more sex shots, that's what Sean likes to say,\" Madison added. \"It was a very positive experience for me.\" Her comments drew mixed responses from intimacy coordinators, critics and fans, with some supporting her making her own decision and others insisting that intimacy coordinators should be mandatory on set. According to SAG-AFTRA's guidelines on intimacy coordinators, the implementation of an intimacy coordinator \"will allow productions to run more efficiently, provide a safety net for performers and establish specialized support that empowers both cast and crew.\" Moore took on her most daring role yet as Elisabeth Sparkle in the Coralie Fargeat-directed film, \"The Substance.\" A risk that paid off and helped her earn several awards already this season, including a Golden Globe for best performance by a female actor in a motion picture, musical or comedy and a Critics Choice Award for best actress. The film follows Moore as a fading celebrity, who takes a black-market drug, which temporarily creates \"a younger, more beautiful, more perfect\" version of herself. The only catch is that Moore's character must share her time with her new self and the balance must be respected. At the 2024 Cannes Film Festival, Moore said she saw Fargeat's script as a \"challenge in the best way.\" \"I look at material that pushes for things that push me out of my comfort zone and if something scares me a little bit, I usually know that there's an opportunity that on the other side it will make me a better person and hopefully a better actor,\" she said. She added, \"I think that this really touched on so many themes that we all face. We all seek a certain sense of validation, belonging -- and by Coralie doing it in a way that took us to the extreme, I think it really allows for you to kind of step into it in a totally unique way.\" Torres' powerful performance in the Walter Salles-directed film, \"I'm Still Here,\" has already earned her a Golden Globe for best performance by a female actor in a motion picture, drama. She was also awarded the Virtuoso Award at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. Torres made history at the time Oscar nominations were announced when she became the second Brazilian actress to earn an Oscar nomination. Her mother, Fernanda Montenegro, who was nominated for best actress in 1998 for her role in \"Central Station,\" was the first. In \"I'm Still Here,\" Torres plays Eunice Paiva, an activist and mother who is forced to reinvent herself after the disappearance of her husband amid military dictatorship in 1971 Brazil. Days after Oscar nominations were announced, Torres was back in the news when a decades-old skit she was a part of on the Brazilian TV show, \"Fantastico,\" resurfaced. In the skit, Torres portrayed multiple characters, including one with blackface. She apologized in a lengthy statement shared by Deadline. \"At that time, despite the efforts of Black movements and organizations, the awareness of the racist history and symbolism of blackface hadn't yet entered the mainstream public consciousness in Brazil,\" she wrote. \"Thanks to better cultural understanding and important but incomplete achievements in this century, it's very clear now in our country and everywhere that blackface is never acceptable.\" \"This is an important conversation we must continue to have with one another in order to prevent the normalization of racist practices then and now,\" she added. \"As an artist and global citizen, and from my open heart, I remain attentive and committed to the pursuit of vital changes needed to live in a world free from inequality and racism.\" Disney is the parent company of Hulu, ABC News and \"Good Morning America.\"  24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":0}

Now, as Musk confirms he wants to put the U.S. Treasury on bitcoin and crypto blockchain technology, the Tesla billionaire has warned those expecting to \"win\" through betting on so-called memecoins are being \u201cfoolish\"\u2014as a memecoin crash threatens the bitcoin price rally.

Dogecoin, a tongue-in-cheek bitcoin rival that was embraced by Elon Musk, is one of the original memecoins and rocketed to an $80 billion market capitalization during the Covid-era crypto rally before crashing back. However, dogecoin managed to hold on to more of its gains than its critics expected and is currently worth around $30 billion. \u201cIf you expect to win at meme coins you\u2019re being foolish, you\u2019re not going to win, don\u2019t sink your life savings into a memecoin \u2026 don\u2019t bet the farm,\" Musk said. The latest memecoin market frenzy began last year, helped by the launch of platforms like Pump.fun that allow memecoins to be easily created in seconds. Memecoins such as dogwifhat, pepe, bonk and shiba inu saw their prices surge, culminating with the launch of Donald Trump-themed memecoin that was endorsed by the president. \u201cWe\u2019ve been hypnotized by price spikes, memecoin frenzies, and media spectacles, forgetting that crypto was meant to be a new financial system\u2014one built on decentralized protocols that make finance accessible to everyone,\" Dom Harz, cofounder of decentralized finance (DeFi) platform Build on Bitcoin (BOB), said via email.

The $trump memecoin soared to over $60 before crashing back and is now trading at under $14. \u201cThe issue isn\u2019t just price declines\u2014it\u2019s the realization that insiders could accumulate large amounts early, leverage major crypto exchanges for liquidity, and then sell to retail investors at over $60 per token, only for it to trade below $16. This growing awareness may be discouraging further speculative frenzy,\" 10x Research founder Markus Thielen wrote in an emailed note. \u201cThis shift in sentiment has significantly dampened retail speculation, reinforcing our cautious outlook. Daily meme coin launches peaked shortly after the $trump coin debut but have declined sharply. $Trump is now down -85% from its highs, trading at just $11.5, leaving retail investors again sitting on heavy losses after buying into the hype.\"","label":0}

They must be tired of answering these sorts of questions, but hey, if people are asking the question, there must be demand.  Or they are just whining like I have been.

We cannot disclose the contents of contracts, such as licenses, to the public. Right now, all I can say is that we are deciding the contents of contracts within our business strategy.\u201d.

Prescott\u2019s latest contract comes with a cap number of $89.896 million in 2025. And, yes, that amount can be reduced by (for example) turning most of his 2025 salary into a signing bonus and spreading it over five years. But even if the Cowboys lower his pay to the minimum of $1.255 million and convert the remaining $46.495 into a guaranteed payment, they\u2019re still looking at a $51.445 million cap charge for the coming year. The move would also jack up each of the next four cap numbers by $9.299 million. Which will set the stage for more restructurings and more can kicking. Whenever the team\u2019s inevitable first year post-Dak arrives, they\u2019ll have to carry a crippling cap charge. Already, for example, a trade before June 1 would result in a dead-money charge of more than $103 million.

There\u2019s support for a 2TB M.2 SSD, which is a game-changer for anyone needing extra high-speed storage on the go. A 100W Power Delivery port means you can keep your laptop or tablet charged without hogging an extra outlet. HDMI output at 4K 120Hz is another welcome addition, especially for those who regularly work with external monitors or need a smooth refresh rate for gaming. Throw in a UHS-II SD card slot, a TF slot, and a USB-A port, and you\u2019ve got a well-rounded hub that can handle just about any connection need.   The touchscreen interface adds a layer of interactivity that you don\u2019t typically see in a hub. Instead of digging through software settings on your laptop, you can tap and swipe directly on the device to check SSD storage, update firmware, or tweak cooling fan speeds. Yes, this thing even has active cooling\u2014a rare but appreciated touch that helps keep performance stable when transferring large files or working with high-power accessories. You can also rotate the screen 180 degrees, which might seem like a minor feature, but it\u2019s the kind of thoughtful detail that makes a difference when setting up your workspace.   Using the Dockcase hub feels surprisingly seamless. Plugging in an SD card instantly gives a readout of available storage, and transferring RAW images from a Sony camera feels fast and effortless. The ability to offload files to the hub\u2019s internal SSD before transferring them to a computer adds a level of flexibility that\u2019s perfect for photographers, videographers, or anyone who works with large media files. The whole process eliminates the need to constantly swap SD cards or rely on cloud storage, which, let\u2019s be honest, is still a headache when dealing with large files on the go.  The build quality is fairly sturdy, and the compact form factor means it doesn\u2019t take up much desk space or weigh down a bag. At just 113 grams (less than 4 ounces), it\u2019s portable enough to carry around without feeling like another bulky piece of gear. And for those who like to keep their setups clean and minimal, it helps consolidate multiple adapters into one unit. Instead of carrying separate dongles for SD cards, external drives, and HDMI output, this hub streamlines the entire process into a single device.   At $129 on Kickstarter (discounted from the expected $179 retail price), it\u2019s not the cheapest hub on the market, but it\u2019s also far from that plastic-clad crap we call USB-C hubs found on Aliexpress and Amazon. This is a workstation tool designed for efficiency, transparency, and reliability. If you\u2019re someone who juggles multiple devices and needs a hub that can keep up with a fast-paced workflow, it\u2019s a compelling option. Plus, its maker, Seesaw, holds pretty high credibility in the crowdfunding circle, with the Dockcase being their 12th Kickstarter campaign. The Dockcase ships only to US, UK, and EU, starting May 2025. Click Here to Buy Now: $129 $179 ($50 off) Hurry!

With the series intended to compete directly against NVIDIA\u2019s upcoming 60-class RTX Blackwell GPUs, including the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti, the RX 9060 series is aimed squarely at budget-conscious gamers. Following the debut of the RDNA 4-powered RX 9070 series, with the flagship Radeon RX 9070 XT, priced at $599, competing against NVIDIA\u2019s RTX 5070 Ti, AMD appears ready to broaden its appeal. While the RX 9070 series has attracted the mid-to-high-end market, affordable options have remained scarce for mainstream consumers. However, the new RX 9060 series is expected to fill this gap, targeting the sub-$400 price bracket. According to early reports from AMD China via MyDrivers, the Radeon RX 9060 series will likely utilise the Navi 44 silicon, a cost-effective GPU architecture. It is also anticipated that these models will come equipped with approximately 8GB of VRAM, with final configurations to be determined as AMD fine-tunes its market positioning. It is anticipated that, following a similar strategy to the RX 9070 launch, AMD will aim to capture the coveted $400-$500 price bracket. This strategic move should provide stiff competition for NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce RTX 5060 and its 'Ti' variant. While the official launch date remains unconfirmed, expectations lean towards an April debut, likely timed after the release of NVIDIA\u2019s 60-class GPUs. However, with no official confirmation yet, the precise release schedule remains speculative. The introduction of the RX 9060 series could represent a significant challenge for NVIDIA, forcing the tech giant to reconsider its market approach if it wishes to retain its competitive edge in the budget segment. Overall, the evolving dynamics in the GPU market promise an intriguing period ahead for both AMD and NVIDIA.
