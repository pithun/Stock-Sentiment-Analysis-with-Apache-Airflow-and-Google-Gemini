That\u2019s a tremendous deal on Google\u2019s last-gen flagship, which still offers an impressive camera array and speedy performance. by  Sheena Vasani If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Update, March 3rd: The Google Pixel 7 Pro is back in stock at Best Buy. It may be a few years old at this point, but the Google Pixel 7 Pro is still a good investment given it currently costs less than some of the best budget phones on the market. Right now, you can pick up an unlocked 7 Pro for $199.99 with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage at Best Buy. That\u2019s the lowest price we\u2019ve seen on the last-gen smartphone, which initially launched at $999. The Pixel 9 Pro is a better phone, but Best Buy\u2019s latest Google promo is still an excellent deal on a smartphone with flagship specs that typically costs considerably more. For just $200, you get a 6.7-inch screen with a speedy 120Hz refresh rate and an impressive triple camera array, one that includes a 48-megapixel telephoto lens. The last-gen smartphone also offers all-day battery life and a robust IP68 rating for water and dust resistance, along with a handful of Pixel-exclusive features, including spam call blocking and the transcribing Recorder app. There are some caveats to bear in mind, though. The Pixel 7 Pro doesn\u2019t offer some of the AI camera tricks found on Google\u2019s newer phones, and it runs on Google\u2019s slower (yet still snappy enough) Tensor G2 chipset. The Pixel 7 Pro isn\u2019t guaranteed to receive OS and security updates after October 2027, either, whereas buying a newer phone will get you a few years more. If extended peace of mind isn\u2019t all that important to you, though, you\u2019ll likely be happy with the Pixel 7 Pro at this price. The Pixel 7 Pro includes a reliably good camera system, great daily performance, and a few clever extras thanks to Google\u2019s custom chipset. Best of all, it costs a little less than the average top-tier flagship. Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we\u2019ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  President Donald Trump said on Monday that the White House will forge ahead with imposing 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada.          \"No room left for Mexico or Canada,\" Trump told reporters during an unrelated White House event. \"The tariffs are all set, they go into effect tomorrow.\"               Trump's comments deepened a sell-off in the stock market during Monday's trading session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped as much as 848 points and the benchmark S&P 500 was down more than 2%. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 3%, with the tech-heavy index extending its decline after a sharp drop in Nvidia stock during the day.               Earlier in the day, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had left the door open that the president might change his mind. Trump already paused the tariffs for a month based on both countries pledging to do more to stem illegal immigration.               Trump on Monday reiterated his view that the tariffs are punishment for Mexico and Canada for failing to do enough to prevent fentanyl from entering the US.               Both nations have already said how they would retaliate with their own tariffs. Canada published an extensive list of targeted American products, ranging from agricultural products to alcoholic beverages. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau previously called on his citizens to prepare to forgo American-made goods.               \"It might mean checking the labels at the supermarket and picking Canadian-made products,\" Trudeau said last month. \"It might mean opting for Canadian rye over Kentucky bourbon, or foregoing Florida orange juice altogether. It might mean changing your summer vacation plans to stay here in Canada.\"               The US imports a range of key goods from the two countries, including crude oil, car parts, and electronics, and trade policy experts previously told BI that new tariffs are\u00a0likely to increase the prices\u00a0of those goods.               Trump previously said that Americans would feel \"some pain\" with tariffs, but the price would be worth it in the end. Still, some companies have started to prepare for price increases caused by the tariffs. Real estate consultants previously told BI that Trump's 25% steel tariff will likely make rent and condo prices surge.               It's unclear how long these tariffs will last. Trump's initial executive order from February said that they would remain in effect until the affected countries cracked down on their drug and border policy.

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"Residents of the Texas capital can now hail a driverless Waymo vehicle \u2014 as long as they\u2019re within the 37-square-mile service area. Residents of the Texas capital can now hail a driverless Waymo vehicle \u2014 as long as they\u2019re within the 37-square-mile service area. by  Andrew J. Hawkins Today\u2019s the day: Waymo\u2019s unlikely partnership with Uber is now live in Austin, Texas. The former rivals have joined forces in the hopes of accelerating the transition to autonomous vehicles, and as of today, any Austin resident with a desire to take a trip in a fully driverless robotaxi can open their Uber app and hail away.  But, of course, there are some limitations.  Waymo only operates within a 37-square-mile area in Austin, which includes Hyde Park, Downtown, Montopolis, and other \u201cpopular destinations,\u201d according to the company. So the trip will need to originate and end within that service area in order to qualify for Waymo. It also doesn\u2019t operate on highways yet, so the route will only comprise local streets.  Another thing to consider: simply calling an Uber in Waymo\u2019s geofence doesn\u2019t guarantee a robotaxi will show up. Waymo spokesperson Chris Bonelli declined to share the size of the company\u2019s fleet in Austin but acknowledged that it was small at launch. \u201cWhile smaller to start, the fleet will grow to hundreds of vehicles over time,\u201d Bonelli said.  As of August 2024, Waymo\u2019s fleet had about 700 vehicles, most of which are in operation in San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles. The company has thousands of Jaguar I-Pace vehicles stored at a warehouse in Phoenix, according to drone footage of the facility. And Waymo has deals with Hyundai and Zeekr to add new vehicles to its fleet over time.  For Austin residents who really have their hearts set on riding in a Waymo vehicle, there are a number of things they can do to indicate their interest. In the Uber app settings under \u201cRide Preferences,\u201d customers can opt in to autonomous rides to increase their chances of being paired with a driverless vehicle.  Waymo has been eyeing Austin as its next robotaxi market since at least August 2023. The company began offering rides to \u201cEarly Testers\u201d (people who join a waitlist and sign nondisclosure agreements to get early access to the company\u2019s robotaxis) in October 2024.  For those keeping score, there were approximately 550 days between identifying Austin as a future robotaxi city and launching the service on the Uber app. Waymo\u2019s success depends partly on narrowing that window for future cities in order to prove its scalability, while keeping an eye on safety.  At launch, Waymo\u2019s vehicles will be available exclusively on Uber\u2019s app in Austin. The two companies first announced a deal to put Waymo\u2019s robotaxis on Uber\u2019s app back in 2023, indicating that Austin would be first, followed by Atlanta. Waymo\u2019s own ridehail app, Waymo One, will not be operational in Austin. Customers who open Waymo One will be redirected to Uber\u2019s app.  For those keeping score, there were approximately 550 days between identifying Austin as a future robotaxi city and launching the service on the Uber app That means certain functions that were controlled in the Waymo One app in other cities will now be controlled through the Uber app. These include unlocking the vehicle, popping the trunk, and starting the trip. Customers can also access 24\/7 customer support through the app or via a button in the Waymo vehicle.  In another first, Uber will manage fleet services, including vehicle cleaning, maintenance, inspections, EV charging, and depot operations. The company is contracting with Avmo (formerly Moove Cars) to handle these tasks. Waymo is still responsible for vehicle testing, roadside assistance, and certain elements of rider support. Waymo and Uber will obviously share in the costs and the revenue produced by the robotaxi service, though both companies have declined to share the split. The launch signals the start of a new era of cooperation between Uber, the rideshare giant that gobbled up the global taxi industry, and upstart Waymo, which is slowly trying to chip away at that dominance.  \u201cStarting today, Austin riders can be matched with a Waymo autonomous vehicle on the Uber app, making their next trip even more special,\u201d said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber. \u201cWith Waymo\u2019s technology and Uber\u2019s proven platform, we\u2019re excited to introduce our customers to a future of transportation that is increasingly electric and autonomous.\u201d It\u2019s important to remember that Uber and Waymo weren\u2019t always so chummy. In 2017, Waymo sued Uber and its subsidiary, self-driving truck startup Otto, over allegations of trade secret theft and patent infringement. The case went to trial almost a year later but ended abruptly when the two sides reached a surprise settlement. Uber later admitted that it misappropriated some of Waymo\u2019s tech and vowed to license it for future use. Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer and the founder of Otto, was sentenced to 18 months in prison for stealing Waymo\u2019s trade secrets but was later pardoned by President Donald Trump. Infamously, Uber was developing its own fleet of autonomous vehicles with the intention to eventually replace all of its human drivers, but the program was shut down after a woman was killed by one of the company\u2019s vehicles in Arizona in 2018. A federal investigation later found Uber to be partly responsible for the incident. Uber sold its robotaxi business to Aurora, which incorporated the work into its development of autonomous trucks.  But as Waymo eyes more markets, most experts agree that the business will take a long time to grow. Uber estimates that the autonomous vehicle market in the US alone is a trillion-dollar opportunity, but Khosrowshahi said during a recent earnings call that it will take \u201cmany, many years\u201d to build out and scale.

The resemblance is\u2026 well, if you squint, maybe? The flaming tail is at least a spot-on detail because as you can plainly tell, the Cheetozard is formed from a Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheeto rather than the less-scorching, lighter-colored regular variety. The lucky (?)\u00a0 buyer also got a custom Pok\u00e9mon card as well as a storage box, presumably more to preserve the snack food\u2019s value rather than spare anyone who might dare to handle it the dreaded cheese-dust fingers.

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"Two people - an 83-year-old woman and a 54-year-old man - have been killed after a vehicle drove into a pedestrian area in the city of Mannheim, western Germany.  Five people were seriously injured and another five suffered minor injuries in the incident, investigators said. Authorities arrested a lone suspect, a 40-year-old German man, who is not believed to be linked to extremism but shows \"concrete indications of mental illness\". The suspect, who prosecutors said was a landscape gardener, remains in hospital in a stable condition after shooting himself with a gun loaded with blanks. The incident occurred at around 12:15 local time (11:15 GMT), Mannheim police said. CCTV footage showed a black hatchback car speeding along Planken shopping street in Mannheim, heading west. Images from the scene showed police inspecting the car, a small black Ford, which had sustained heavy damage to its front. The images show the car missing a hub cap on its front left wheel. In the CCTV footage, the front left hub cap also appears to be missing. Thomas Strobl, interior minister of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, said the man used the vehicle \"as a weapon\". \"This act is one of several crimes in the recent past in which a car was misused as a weapon,\" Mr Strobl said, but added that there is no evidence to suggest the incident is connected to the Easter carnival taking place in the city. Police are investigating two counts of murder and several of attempted murder, Mannheim chief public prosecutor Romeo Schluessler told reporters. Mannheim's mayor described the incident as \"abhorrent and \"inhumane\". \"Our thoughts are with the dead and injured, their families and friends,\" Mayor Christian Specht said. Olaf Scholz, Germany's outgoing chancellor, thanked the emergency services and wished \"strength\" for eyewitnesses in Mannheim to \"process what they have experienced\". \"We mourn with the relatives of the victims of a senseless act of violence and fear for those injured,\" he said in a social media post. The incident comes at a time of heightened security as outdoor carnivals linked to Easter celebrations are held across Germany. There was a parade through the Mannheim city centre on Sunday, with major events scheduled for Tuesday.  A market has now been closed and a street carnival in the city centre will not take place. Carnival events in the nearby suburbs of Feudenheim, Neckarau and Sandhofen have also been cancelled. Germany has endured a number of violent attacks over the last year, which have left several people dead and hundreds injured. Nine months ago, also in Mannheim and only a few blocks away from where Monday's attack is believed to have taken place, an Afghan man stabbed several people, killing a policeman. Then, in August, another knife attack left eight people injured and three dead in Solingen. The Syrian man who was charged with the crime was suspected of links with the Islamic State terrorist group. In December a man rammed a car into a crowd at a Christmas market in Magdeburg, leaving six dead and 299 injured. A 50-year-old Saudi psychiatrist was arrested. In January, a 28-year-old Afghan asylum seeker attacked a group of small children in a park in the Bavarian town of Aschaffenburg, killing a two-year-old child and a passer-by who tried to help the boy. And in February, a 24-year-old Afghan asylum seeker drove a car into a crowd, injuring more than two dozen people. A mother and child later died from their injuries. The move alters the German constitution, allowing the country to increase its military spending. German MPs could pave the way for huge investments to defend Europe against a threatening Russia. Germany's conservative leader clinches an major financial agreement ahead of a crunch vote in parliament. China denies German media reports of an assessment carried out by spying agency BND in 2020 supporting the theory. Germany's central bank president says US tariffs and retaliation to them could tip Europe's largest economy into recession again. Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  A bubble tea chain from China just went public, and it's off to a very sweet start.          Mixue, a bubble tea and ice cream chain founded in 1997 in China's Henan province, debuted on Hong Kong's stock market on Monday. It offered close to 17.1 million shares, amounting to 3.45 billion Hong Kong dollars, or about $444 million.               The stock jumped more than 30% to HK$262 when markets opened on Monday. When markets closed, it was trading at HK$294, 45% higher than its IPO price.               Mixue is the world's biggest fast-food chain by store count. As of September, it had more than 45,000 stores \u2014 franchisees and self-owned \u2014 around the world. It has outpaced the retail footprints of Starbucks and McDonald's, which have about 40,000 and 41,000 outlets worldwide, respectively.               The chain's founder, Zhang Hongchao, and his younger brother, Zhang Hongfu, the chain's CEO,have a combined net worth of $8.1 billion after the share sale, Bloomberg reported on Sunday.               Mixue's main draw is its cheap products, customers in Singapore told Business Insider.               The chain has about 20 outlets in Singapore, all operating as to-go counters. When BI visited an outlet near Singapore's Central Business District at lunchtimeon Monday, there were about five people in line.               The storefront's most prominent visual was the brand's \"Snow King\" mascot \u2014 a snowman wearing a crown.               The cheapest item at the store was the Signature King Cone ice cream, which cost 1.50 Singapore dollars, or about $1.10. The most expensive item was the cheese strawberry drink for SG$4. Most of the store's drinks were priced from SG$2.50 to SG$3.50.               Eden Loke, 23, who works in communications, said she first heard of Mixue when someone wearing the brand's inflatable \"Snow King\" mascot was filmed prancing around a shopping complex in Singapore. The mascot's shenanigans at the mall \u2014 including a dance-off with another brand's mascot \u2014 went viral on TikTok.               \"The viral marketing, likable branding, word of mouth from family, and unbeatable prices resonated with me,\" Loke said.               She said her go-to drink was Mixue's kiwi oolong tea, which costs SG$3.50. Loke said the low price was the biggest factor in making her pick the brand over other stores.               Eli Tun, a student waiting for his regular order \u2014 a SG$3 taro milk tea \u2014 said he first spotted the brand in Malaysia last year and realized how cheap the drinks were.               Since then, he's switched from buying from other popular bubble tea brands in Singapore, such as LiHo Tea or Koi The, saying he'd rather pay SG$3 at Mixue than SG$6 for a similar drink elsewhere.               \"I'm not looking for the cream of the crop of drinks, just something to drink while going home,\" Tun, 19, said.               Nathanael Chow, an investment consultant, said he always gets the Signature King Cone at Mixue \u2014 vanilla soft-serve ice cream in a tall waffle cone.               Chow said he was drawn to the brand because of the brand's catchy jingle, which is set to the tune of \"Oh! Susanna.\" Some Mixue outlets play the jingle at the store, though the shop BI visited did not.               Jason Yu, the managing director for Greater China at the UK-based consumer research group Kantar Worldpanel, said Mixue's edge in China's highly competitive bubble tea market is that most of its products are priced under RMB 10, or about $1.40.               \"This is very attractive to consumers in the lower-tier cities and towns,\" Yu said.               Alexandra Leung, the founder of Monogic, a food and beverage marketing and public relations agency in Singapore and Hong Kong, said Mixue's success came from small shops in high-traffic areas, particularly around campuses.               \"This approach not only captures a significant customer base but also ensures high foot traffic and brand loyalty, especially among students who frequently consume their products,\" Leung said.               While other bubble tea brands have been focusing on premium positioning with prices above 20 Chinese yuan in Tier 1 cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, Mixue \"successfully established its presence in lower-tier cities where competition is less intense,\" Leung said.               China has seen a bubble tea IPO boom.               In mid-February, Guming Holdings debuted in Hong Kong. Its stock was trading at HK$11.40 when markets closed on Monday.               Sichuan Baicha Baidao Industrial Co \u2014 also known as Chabaidao\u00a0\u2014 went public in Hong Kong in April. It was offered for HK$17.50 in April and traded at HK$9.70 when markets closed Monday.               Representatives for Mixue didn't respond to a request for comment.

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump launched a trade war Tuesday against America\u2019s three biggest trading partners, drawing immediate retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China and sending financial markets into a tailspin as the U.S. faced the threat of rekindled inflation and paralyzing uncertainty for business. Just after midnight, Trump imposed 25% taxes, or tariffs, on Mexican and Canadian imports, though he limited the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. Trump also doubled the tariff he slapped last month on Chinese products to 20%. Advertisement Advertisement Beijing retaliated with tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports. It also expanded the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen. Read More: Farmers Fear More Pain From Trump\u2019s Trade War In an address to Congress Tuesday night, Trump repeated two different explanations for his tariffs on Canada and Mexico. He cited the trade deficits the U.S. has with both countries, but also said, \u201cthey\u2019ve allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens.\u201d Trump also acknowledged there could be \u201ca little disturbance\u201d from the tariffs, a possible nod to the stock market\u2019s sharp falls in the past two days as well as concerns about inflation. \u201cIt may be a little bit of an adjustment period,\u201d he said after claiming that farmers would benefit from reciprocal tariffs on countries that have tariffs on U.S. exports. \u201cYou have to bear with me again and this will be even better.\u201d Read More: How Trump\u2019s Tariffs Could Affect U.S. Consumers Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his country would plaster tariffs on over $100 billion (U.S. dollars) of American goods over the course of 21 days. \u201cToday the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they are talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\u201d Trudeau said. Later in the day, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the U.S. would likely meet Canada and Mexico \u201cin the middle,\u201d with an announcement coming as soon as Wednesday. Lutnick told Fox Business News that the tariffs would not be paused, but that Trump would reach a compromise. \u201cI think he\u2019s going to figure out, you do more, and I\u2019ll meet you in the middle in some way,\u201d Lutnick said. A Canadian senior government official said Lutnick called Ontario Premier Doug Ford after Ford\u2019s press conference and asked him to stand down. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the call, said Ford told the U.S. commerce secretary he\u2019ll go harder. The official said Lutnick told Ford that Trudeau\u2019s \u201cvery dumb\u201d comment and remarks by other Canadian officials were not helpful, but said Lutnick seemed to acknowledge the tariffs are a part of negotiation toward a trade deal. A senior Canadian official said Trudeau told the premiers of Canada\u2019s provinces that he hopes to speak to Trump on Wednesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the call. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Mexico will respond to the new taxes with its own retaliatory tariffs. Sheinbaum said she will announce the products Mexico will target on Sunday. The delay might indicate that Mexico still hopes to de-escalate Trump\u2019s trade war. China indicated on Tuesday night that it would not back down. \u201cIf war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we\u2019re ready to fight till the end,\u201d China\u2019s embassy to the United States posted on X. The president is abandoning the free trade policies the United States pursued for decades after World War II. He argues that open trade cost America millions of factory jobs and that tariffs are the path to national prosperity. He rejects the views of mainstream economists who contend that such protectionism is costly and inefficient. Import taxes are \u201ca very powerful weapon that politicians haven\u2019t used because they were either dishonest, stupid or paid off in some other form,\u201d Trump said Monday. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re using them.\u201d Dartmouth College economist Douglas Irwin, author of a 2017 history of U.S. tariff policy, has calculated that Tuesday\u2019s hikes will lift America\u2019s average tariff from 2.4% to 10.5%, the highest level since the 1940s. \u201cWe\u2019re in a new era for sure.\u201d As the trade disputes escalated, stocks racked up more losses Tuesday on Wall Street, wiping out all the gains since Election Day for the S&P 500. Markets in Europe also fell sharply. The American president has injected a disorienting volatility into the world economy, leaving it off balance as people wonder what he will do next. During his first term, Trump imposed tariffs only after lengthy investigations\u2014into the national security implications of relying on foreign steel, for example, said Michael House, co-chair of the international trade practice at the Perkins Coie law firm. But by declaring a national emergency involving the flow of immigrants and illicit drugs across U.S. borders, \u201che can modify these tariffs with a stroke of the pen,\u201d House said. \u201cIt\u2019s chaotic.\u201d Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the tariffs. \u201cPresidents don\u2019t get to invent emergencies to justify bad policies,\u201d said Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \u201cAbusing emergency powers to wage an economic war on our closest allies isn\u2019t leadership\u2014it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d Even some Republican senators raised alarms. \u201cMaine and Canada\u2019s economy are integrated,\u201d said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, explaining that much of the state\u2019s lobsters and blueberries are processed in Canada and then sent back to the U.S. Truck driver Carlos Ponce, 58, went about business as usual Tuesday morning, transporting auto parts from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, to El Paso, Texas, just as he\u2019s done for decades. Like many on the border, he was worried about the fallout from the tariffs. \u201cThings could change drastically,\u201d Ponce said. Truckers could lose their jobs or have to drive farther to coastal ports as Mexican manufacturers look for trading partners beyond the U.S. Alan Russell, head of Tecma, which helps factories set up in places like Ciudad Juarez, is skeptical that Trump\u2019s tariffs will bring manufacturing back to the United States. \u201cNobody is going to move their factory until they have certainty,\u201d Russell said. Just last week, he said, Tecma helped a North Carolina manufacturer that moved to Mexico because it couldn\u2019t find enough workers in the United States. U.S. businesses near the Canadian border scrambled to deal with the impact. Gutherie Lumber in suburban Detroit reached out Tuesday to Canadian suppliers about the cost of 8-foot wood studs. About 15% of the lumber at the Gutherie yard in Livonia, Michigan, comes from Canada. Sales manager Mike Mahoney said Canadian suppliers are already raising prices. \u201cThey\u2019re putting that 25% on studs.\u201d Builders will strain to stay within their budgets. After years of effort and thousands of dollars in investment, Tom Bard, a Kentucky craft bourbon distiller, gained a foothold in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Alberta and watched his sales grow north of the border. Now Kentucky bourbon is in Canada\u2019s crosshairs, and an order from his Canadian distributors is on hold. \u201cThat hurts,\u201d he said. At his small distillery \u201cevery single pallet that goes out the door makes a huge difference ... The last thing you want is to have an empty spot where your bottles are supposed to be on a shelf.\u201d Bard co-owns the Bard Distillery with his wife, Kim, in western Kentucky\u2019s Muhlenberg County, about 135 miles (217 kilometers) southwest of Louisville, Kentucky. Trump overwhelmingly carried Kentucky in the November election. In Muhlenberg County, Trump defeated Kamala Harris by a more than 3-to-1 margin. The China tariffs also threaten the U.S. toy industry. Greg Ahearn, president and CEO of the Toy Association, said the 20% tariffs on Chinese goods will be \u201ccrippling,\u201d as nearly 80% of toys sold in the U.S. are made in China. Rachel Lutz owns the Peacock Room, four women\u2019s boutique shops with about 15 employees in Detroit. She\u2019s been bracing for the tariffs but doesn\u2019t understand the logic behind them. \u201cI\u2019m struggling to see the wisdom in picking a fight with our largest trading partner that we\u2019ve had historically wonderful relationships with,\u201d Lutz said Tuesday from her shop. \u201cI\u2019m struggling to really understand how they can\u2019t see that will profoundly impact our economy in ways that I think the American consumer has not predicted. We\u2019re about to find out.\u201d \u2014Gillies reported from Toronto.

Niche markets have always existed, and always will. But they only pay the rent for a handful of people. FWIW I think Manning is superior to O'Reilly in pretty much every way these days.  They have some great authors and the physical quality of the books is drastically better than O'Reilly, who seems to have made it their singular goal to create the shittiest quality books possible.  The paper, the binding, and the printing are utterly unacceptable, especially considering the price they're charging. Plus, Manning gives you a free PDF version of any physical book you buy.

I used to visit a book club forum I stopped visiting because it became apparent to me no one there was actually interesting in fiction or discussing it and they were mostly talking about the concept of reading that fiction and treating it as their image and most swore by hardcopy while I heavily favor reading on my phone, a foldable, because it's more convenient, customizable, and allows one to carry a limitless amount of fiction on one's person at all time.

I remember when getting to the end of the book ment  Most popular books have (or used to have) three editions. Hardcover, big soft-cover, little soft-cover. I'm not sure which of those is called \"trade paperback\" so I didn't use the term :) The bigger paperbacks have the larger print, and a middle price. What you called big soft-cover are likely trade paperbacks. The small ones are generally the mass market releases.

I prefer paperbacks just because they're more compact, so this kind of sucks, but then again I'm more likely to shop at used book stores than anywhere else. The trade market paperbacks are hardly any more compact than the hardbacks, and the binding is a LOT worse. I'd unilaterally prefer a mass-market paperback to a trade paperback, to be honest. I want to hold it comfortably in my hand. After all, I'm likely only going to read it once, then keep it for reference. They can last forever, if you take care of them. I just finished \"The Gods Themselves\" by Isaac Asimov, a 50-year-old mass market paperback I picked up at a thrift store, and it's still in very good condition. Smells amazing too. I'm sure they don't make them like the used to, though. Most all of my old paperbacks (mass market) have become almost unreadable from the browning of the acid paper. My old hardbound textbooks (60+ years) are still in good shape. I would say great shape, but they weren't in that condition when I bought them used for class, sometime fourth or fifth hand, Current paperbacks are usually of such low quality, that I don't bother with them, and the hardbound books aren't a whole lot better. Although it has some drawbacks, I do love my Kobo reader. Really, do you store them outside? I have lots of paperbacks from the 90s and early 2000s that are yellowed but perfectly readable. E-books are often linked to Print On Demand services, so if readers want a physical copy they can get one. What this really means is no impulse purchases from bookstore shelves, because there won't be a 'display model' there to see while browsing. No, I didn't, but I'm going to look for it now. I've been looking for a Canadian publisher, but it's tough to beat Amazon's reach, easy of publishing, and royalty rates. Usually it's the hardcover that's the bargain while they are still on the New York Times Bestseller List. Then, a year later, the paperback would come out and cost a few dollars more than the book cost as a hardcover just one year before. I guess the Kindle and Nook have changed everything.

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"While Donald Trump took questions from the press at the White House Monday afternoon, the stock market plummeted, and Fox News displayed a graphic showing the dip while carrying Trump\u2019s remarks live.\u00a0 Trump told reporters that he planned to enact his long-threatened 25 percent tariffs against goods from Mexico and Canada and 10 percent tariffs against goods from China starting Tuesday, to which the Dow Jones, Nasdaq, and S&P 500 did not respond well. Fox News, along with their usual breaking news chyron, also had the Dow index displayed while Trump was speaking, showing a fall of more than 650 points.  Fox now displaying a ticker showing the stock market tanking while Trump is talking about tariffs pic.twitter.com\/BmNlNvkCTz Trump\u2019s remarks were preceded by his early afternoon announcement on Truth Social addressed to \u201cthe Great Farmers of the United States.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cGet ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States. Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!\u201d Trump posted. But it seems that there was little fun to be had in the stock market based on the fears of higher prices and other\u00a0 negative ripple effects. This, coupled with fewer food imports from three of America\u2019s largest trading partners, will ultimately lead to higher food prices across the country, something that Trump campaigned against during the 2024 election and that ultimately played a factor in his victory. Plus, the prices of various other goods, from cars to electronics to over-the-counter pills, also will likely see a sharp increase.\u00a0 Don\u2019t expect Trump to take responsibility for a sinking stock market or higher prices, though. He\u2019s already saying that rising inflation isn\u2019t his fault and has tacitly admitted that his tariffs will cause prices to go up. His administration is even discussing how to juke economic numbers to try and hide how badly Trump\u2019s radical changes, including those from Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, are hurting the economy. It looks like our wallets are about to have a rough spring.  Donald Trump is scheduled to speak with several Cabinet members Monday regarding Ukraine policy and the possibility of ending military assistance to the beleaguered Eastern European nation. That could include withholding equipment, such as ammunition and radars, as well as limiting the amount of intelligence shared with the Ukrainian military, according to a U.S. official who spoke with The Washington Post. The meeting will involve Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, and special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, the last of whom met with Russian officials last month regarding a potential peace deal.  During a White House press conference earlier Monday, Trump repeatedly ducked reporters\u2019 questions as to whether his administration\u2019s actions had aligned U.S. policy with Moscow. Rather than saying \u201cno,\u201d Trump went on a breathy rant claiming that the war never would have happened if he was in office at the onset of the conflict. \u201cI wanna see it end fast. I don\u2019t want to see this go on for years and years. Now, President Zelenskiy supposedly made a statement today in AP\u2014I\u2019m not a big fan of AP, so maybe it was an incorrect statement\u2014but he said he thinks the war is gonna go on for a long time, uh, and he better not be right about that, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying,\u201d Trump said. Russian forces crossed the Ukrainian border on February 24, 2022, which Russian President Vladimir Putin tried to justify by falsely claiming that he needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine. The U.S. and Russia opened discussions at a meeting in Saudi Arabia last month, seeking a conclusion to the three-year war, but the assembly conspicuously excluded Ukrainian leadership. When asked whether he had discussed the ending of military aid to Ukraine, however, Trump said that \u201cthings\u201d were happening \u201cas we speak.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t even talked about that right now,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cI mean, right now, we\u2019ll see what happens. A lot of things are happening right now, literally as we speak.\u201d On Friday, Trump and JD Vance overtly showed where their loyalties lie: Seated in front of the press in the White House, the pair refused to let Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy speak, allowed a conservative reporter to mock Zelenskiy\u2019s wartime attire, and effectively leveraged the critical meeting for measly political gain by defending Putin at the cost of denigrating former American officials. And in doing so, they challenged America\u2019s strongest alliances while ceding the world stage to its adversaries. Donald Trump buffered while trying desperately to talk around a direct question Monday about aligning U.S. foreign policy with Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s designs for Ukraine.\u00a0 During a press conference, Trump was asked whether he was \u201cconsidering canceling military aid to Ukraine\u201d after his disastrous meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy Friday.\u00a0 Trump and Vice President JD Vance put on an outrageous display berating the wartime president for failing to prostrate before them as they demanded he pay the U.S. back for aid, imploding negotiations with Ukraine to the delight of the Kremlin. \u00a0 The president was also asked to respond to concerns that he was moving the \u201cU.S. worldview in alignment with Moscow.\u201d In response, Trump rattled off a list of everything that \u201cwould have never happened\u201d if he\u2019d won the presidential election four years ago.\u00a0 Trump\u2019s nonanswer, which veered further and further off-topic, included the October 7 massacre, \u201cIsrael,\u201d inflation, the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, and China possessing the Bagram Air Base (the Taliban has denied that China controls the former U.S. base). Finally, he circled back to Ukraine\u2014but only to complain, not to actually answer the question.\u00a0 \u201cI wanna see it end fast. I don\u2019t want to see this go on for years and years. Now, President Zelenskiy supposedly made a statement today in AP\u2014I\u2019m not a big fan of AP, so maybe it was an incorrect statement\u2014but he said he thinks the war is gonna go on for a long time, uh and he better not be right about that, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying,\u201d Trump said. Trump doesn't answer a question asking him about if he's bringing US policy in alignment with Moscow pic.twitter.com\/bACfEmMNkZ Zelenskiy was quoted Monday saying that peace with Russia \u201cis still very, very far away,\u201d following his talk with the U.S. president. Trump called the quote \u201cthe worst statement that could have been made,\u201d in a post on Truth Social. Trump was also asked whether Americans should be disturbed that Kremlin officials said his foreign policy was \u201clargely in line\u201d with Russia\u2019s vision. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you what, I think it takes two to tango,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cAnd you\u2019re gonna have to make a deal with Russia, and you\u2019re gonna have to make a deal with Ukraine. You\u2019re gonna have to have the, uhhhh, assent and you\u2019re gonna have to have the consent from the European nations, \u2019cause I think that\u2019s important\u2014and from us. I think everybody has to get into a room, so to speak, and we have to make a deal. And the deal could be made very fast. It should not be that hard a deal to make. It could be made very fast.\u201d\u00a0 Trump previously claimed that he could resolve the war within 24 hours of entering the White House.\u00a0 Then the president pivoted to continue whining about Zelenskiy: \u201cNow maybe somebody doesn\u2019t want to make a deal, and if somebody doesn\u2019t want to make a deal, I think that person won\u2019t be around very long. That person will not be listened to very long. Because I believe that Russia wants to make a deal. I believe certainly the people of Ukraine want to make a deal\u2014they\u2019ve suffered more than anybody else. We talk about suffering, they suffered.\u201d \u201cBut if you think about it, under President Bush they got Georgia, right? Russia got Georgia. Under President Obama they got a nice big submarine base, a nice big chunk of land where they have their submarines. You know that, right? Crimea,\u201d Trump said, inhaling heavily.\u00a0 It\u2019s worth remembering that Trump had been a cheerleader for Putin following Russia\u2019s invasion of Crimea in 2014, claiming that Crimeans \u201cwould rather be with Russia.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cUnder President Trump they got nothing. And under President O\u2019Biden they tried to get the whole thing,\u201d Trump said, garbling his predecessor\u2019s name. \u201cThey tried to get the whole big, uh, big Ukraine. The whole thing. If I didn\u2019t get in here, they would have gotten the whole thing.\u201d Trump\u2019s support for the foreign dictator emboldened Russia, and his lack of support for Zelenskiy weakened the country, making way for Russia to launch its ground offensive in 2022. With Trump in office, Russia wouldn\u2019t walk away empty-handed.\u00a0 The White House instructed the State and Treasury departments Monday to draft a plan lifting U.S. sanctions on Russian individuals and entities, including oligarchs, who Trump recently claimed \u201care very nice people.\u201d It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what the U.S. would receive in return for sanctions relief. And earlier this month, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth suggested that Kyiv should abandon hopes of restoring its illegally seized territory from Russia. A leading spokesperson in the Department of Health and Human Services announced his resignation Monday after stark disagreements with Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over how to manage the growing measles outbreak. Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Thomas Corry resigned effective immediately on Friday only two weeks after starting the job, he posted on LinkedIn, wishing his colleagues in the department \u201cthe best and great success.\u201d Corry reportedly butted heads with Kennedy and Kennedy\u2019s principal deputy chief of staff, Stefanie Spear, over how to manage the department, according to Politico. Specifically, Corry was not happy with Kennedy\u2019s initial response to Texas\u2019s growing measles outbreak, which has infected at least 146 people and caused the first measles death in the United States in 10 years. Last week, Kennedy said during a Cabinet meeting that measles outbreaks were not unusual, despite the fact that measles had been declared eliminated in 2000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since then, Kennedy said that HHS was helping health officials in Texas respond to the outbreak and spoke approvingly of the measles vaccine, but has still stopped short of calling for everyone to get vaccinated, writing Sunday in a Fox News op-ed that \u201cthe decision to vaccinate is a personal one.\u201d \u201cParents play a pivotal role in safeguarding their children\u2019s health,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAll parents should consult with their healthcare providers to understand their options to get the [measles, mumps, and rubella] vaccine. Corry is a Trump administration veteran, having served during the president\u2019s first term as senior adviser and communications director at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, so his resignation so soon into Trump\u2019s second term is sure to arouse suspicion. Kennedy has long had a reputation for being anti-vaccine, although he tried to deny his previous comments during his confirmation hearings. Since his confirmation to lead HHS, Kennedy\u2019s actions have not been reassuring. He has paused multiple vaccine developments in the department and on his first day fired critical employees, including members of the CDC who respond to outbreaks. Only a couple of years after a global Covid-19 pandemic, Kennedy is applying the wrong lessons and is not proving himself to be up to managing the country\u2019s public health.  In a move to further castigate the Ukrainian president, Trump reportedly wants Volodymyr Zelenskiy to formally apologize for his behavior before any rare earths deal goes forward. \u201cI have been told by a senior official here that nothing\u2019s gonna happen with this minerals deal until Zelenskiy goes in front of cameras and makes an explicit public apology for the way that he behaved himself in the Oval Office,\u201d said Fox\u2019s Peter Doocy on Monday. This is more fallout from the disastrous meeting that Zelenskiy, Trump, and Vice President JD Vance had on Friday, in which the president and his sidekick berated the weary Zelenskiy to his face, chiding the Ukrainian president for not respecting them enough and not appearing gracious enough while he deals with Russia\u2019s unprompted assault\u2014which Trump also blames him for. Trump later kicked him out. Trump has been particularly obsessed with these minerals in the past weeks, making a deal a prerequisite for any further aid to Ukraine. Now it\u2019s looking like the U.S. will waltz in and seize control\u2014with the Kremlin\u2019s help.  Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency is once again reorganizing its wall of hunting trophies from supposedly slain government contracts. This time, it has quietly removed five of its seven largest kills from last week, erasing $4 billion in supposed savings. The New York Times reported Monday that the night before, DOGE erased or altered 1,000 claimed savings, or roughly 40 percent of entries into its \u201cwall of receipts,\u201d which has previously proven to be exaggerated or fraudulent. That appears to have been the case with the contracts that were removed Sunday. The removals included the site\u2019s biggest trophy, a canceled contract with Centennial Technologies for technical support for the IRS, which was supposedly worth $1.9 billion. Although DOGE had bragged about the \u201cincredible job\u201d the U.S. Treasury had done in identifying the waste, the Times reported earlier last month that the contract had actually been canceled in November, during the Biden administration. On Sunday, it disappeared from the wall.  Another vanished entry claimed $133 million in savings from canceling a contract between USAID and development firm Chemonics International in Libya, but a LinkedIn post revealed that the contract had ended last year. In some cases, it seems that DOGE didn\u2019t even earn its biggest hunting trophies. Other entries were removed due to obvious accounting mistakes that appeared to be the product of human error. One claimed $149 million in savings from a canceled contract to provide administrative support to the Department of Health and Human Services. But DOGE\u2019s website linked to the wrong contract, which didn\u2019t list the correct company, purpose, or value.  Even after the latest round of deletions, errors still persisted on the site. DOGE still claimed that it had saved $106 million by canceling two contracts for administrative support to the U.S. Coast Guard\u2014but in reality, those contracts were completed during the Bush administration.  This isn\u2019t the first time that this has happened. DOGE\u2019s website, which was once meant to showcase the organization\u2019s major victories, has turned into a hall of humiliation, subject to constant reorganization and worthy of extreme doubt. The latest massive deletion has yet to be acknowledged by DOGE.  Just last week, DOGE deleted the top five highest savings from its website, after various news outlets documented the multiple errors in its accounting, including a $232 million cut to the Social Security Administration that was actually only $560,000, an $8 billion cut at Immigration and Customs Enforcement that was worth about $8 million, and three supposedly $655 million cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development that amounted to only $18 million. Despite the rescission of some of the group\u2019s largest cuts, the website now boasts to have saved $105 billion, as a \u201ccombination of asset sales, contract\/lease cancellations and renegotiations, fraud and improper payment deletion, grant cancellations, interest savings, programmatic changes, regulatory savings, and workforce reductions.\u201d The Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s wide-ranging and haphazard cuts to the federal government have reached the nation\u2019s nuclear safety programs. Just before Valentine\u2019s Day, at the direction of Elon Musk, the Trump administration nixed 17 percent of the National Nuclear Security Administration\u2019s workforce despite the objections of senior officials, The Washington Post reported Monday.  \u201cThe president said workers critical to national security would be exempt from the firings. But then there was an active decision to say these positions are not critical to national security,\u201d one unidentified official at the agency told the Post. \u201cIt is so absurd I don\u2019t even know what to say.\u201d Previous reporting had revealed that the staff reductions at the nuclear agency were part of a larger layoff by DOGE directed at the Department of Energy that sought to ax up to 2,000 employees. DOGE pledged that the mass firing only affected noncritical employees who \u201cheld primarily administrative and clerical roles,\u201d but that was little more than a bold-faced lie. One of the staffers forced out of his position included acting Chief of Defense Nuclear Safety James Todd, a senior executive official and the \u201ctop authority for all nuclear-safety matters in the agency,\u201d The Bulwark reported last month. Other critical employees dismissed in the purge included staffers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, which is responsible for maintaining and minimizing radiation and potential damage from accidents at the nuclear site. The cut workers included an emergency preparedness manager, a radiation protection manager, the security manager, the fire protection engineer, and two facility representatives. The losses were considered so ill-advised and extreme that the semiautonomous National Nuclear Security Administration reversed course on the hatchet job, welcoming the affected employees back to their jobs. The White House also walked back the decision after it received a \u201cstream of panicked calls\u201d from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who demanded the immediate reinstatement of some 314 nuclear staff workers, including engineers, technicians, and managers, according to the Post.  \u201cThese are jobs directly tied to keeping bad things from happening at facilities in places like Tennessee, Texas, New Mexico, Nebraska, and Kansas City, Missouri,\u201d another anonymous official who recently left their job told the newspaper. \u201cA lot of them are in red states. These lawmakers are not thrilled by the potential for bad things happening in their communities.\u201d But the process wasn\u2019t as simple as an invite back to the office. Instead, dejected and \u201cshell shocked\u201d employees at the NNSA are considering early retirement or looking for work in more stable sectors, unsure of if or when the Trump administration might try to dismiss them again, according to The Bulwark. Musk\u2019s rapid-fire cuts at the NNSA serve as another monstrous example that Silicon Valley\u2019s \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d philosophy can\u2019t be easily adopted or translated into a federal bureaucracy providing critical services. The tech billionaire has similarly had to walk back cuts that his juvenile team made to the nation\u2019s disease-prevention programs, as well as Food and Drug Administration teams responsible for reviewing AI-assisted surgery protocols and food safety, among other layoffs. Further still, DOGE has not lived up to its promises. The organization has had to rescind claims that it saved the government billions of dollars, deleting details from the group\u2019s \u201cwall of receipts\u201d after journalists fact-checked that the programs they slashed never actually tallied up to the bold savings. Trump issued an ominous message to American farmers as he announced his planned kneecapping of their most profitable market: foreign exports. \u201cTo the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday. \u201cTariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!\u201d This will have a massive, direct impact on how much money farmers\u2014many of whom are still reeling from the tariffs (and subsequent bailout) from Trump\u2019s first term\u2014will make from the products they grow. Agricultural exports like soybeans, grains, fruit, vegetables, and livestock products provided U.S. farmers with about $180 billion in annual revenue in the 2023 fiscal year. It\u2019s unlikely that the farmers will see the \u201cfun\u201d in having to radically readjust their processes for less revenue. This coincides with Trump\u2019s tariff war, as he plans to levy massive 25 percent tariffs on imported goods from Canada and Mexico and 10 percent on goods from China. Chinese state media over the weekend reported that China planned to retaliate with tariffs on U.S. agriculture\u2014perhaps leading Trump to decide to destroy American farmers himself. Donald Trump is celebrating his administration\u2019s move to ignore a law that targeted money laundering. On Sunday, the Treasury Department announced that it would stop enforcing \u201cany penalties or fines associated with the beneficial ownership information reporting rule under the existing regulatory deadlines, but it will further not enforce any penalties or fines against U.S. citizens or domestic reporting companies or their beneficial owners after the forthcoming rule changes take effect either.\u201d In effect, the government will no longer require shell companies to disclose their owners and beneficiaries, allowing wealthy corporations and individuals to hide their profits from the public. The rule was part of the Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA, passed in 2021, which required some businesses to report information on people who own or control a company, indirectly or directly, to the department\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Trump quickly took to Truth Social after the Treasury announcement, posting, \u201cExciting News!\u201d \u201cThis Biden rule has been an absolute disaster for Small Businesses Nationwide,\u201d Trump\u2019s post read. \u201cFurthermore, the Treasury is now finalizing an Emergency Regulation to formally suspend this rule for American businesses. The economic menace of [Beneficial Ownership Information] reporting will soon be no more.\u201d Republicans have long opposed the CTA, claiming that the requirements are too steep for small businesses and companies to fulfill. The rule on beneficial ownership was supposed to go into effect in January, but a federal court order froze enforcement of the rule. The CTA was passed by the Biden administration to tackle tax evasion and corporate cronyism, which, unsurprisingly, is at odds with the Trump administration. Since his inauguration, Trump has gone after financial regulation as well as government agencies that seek to curb corporate power, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Earlier this month, the president also issued an executive order freezing enforcement of the 48-year-old Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits any person or company tied to the United States from paying money or offering gifts to foreign officials to help their business. It seems that Trump wants his friends in the corporate world, as well as his own businesses, to be able to rake in profits with much less restrictions, and if they so choose, hide them from the public. It will now be easier for a business with unpopular practices, or a president with shady business interests, to avoid scrutiny.  The Democratic National Committee has decided to double down on the same losing strategies that lost it the last election. Newly elected DNC Chair Ken Martin on Monday named Roger Lau as executive director of the committee. Lau has been serving as the DNC\u2019s deputy executive director since 2021, joining the committee after running Elizabeth Warren\u2019s unsuccessful 2020 presidential campaign. Politico\u2019s Lisa Kashinsky noted that Lau\u2019s appointment was a sign that the party is \u201ctaking a stay-the-course approach to staffing despite the party\u2019s losses in November.\u2026 Their selections reflect the DNC\u2019s post-election preference for experienced operatives over shaking up the party apparatus on South Capitol Street.\u201d Former DNC chief of staff Libby Schneider will become deputy executive director, after previously serving as a senior adviser and national rural political director. Jessica Wright, who worked most recently as Biden\u2019s State Department chief of staff for operations, will also join the DNC as deputy executive director as well as the new chief of staff to the chair. Ohio Representative Joyce Beatty, Washington State Democrats Chair Shasti Conrad, and union chief Stuart Appelbaum will be associate chairs.  The party faces a crossroads between business-as-usual moderate liberalism and a more aggressive attempt at large, progressive policy. It seems clear that it\u2019s chosen the former, as centrists gather behind closed doors to blame identity politics for their loss and the party picks Senator Elissa Slotkin to respond to Trump\u2019s joint congressional address on Tuesday. Only time will tell how far this 2016-esque approach to politics will get the party. Right now, it\u2019s mostly just resulted in political failure. ","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"     From Barbie to Barcelona for Mobile World Congress 2025 -- Finnish phone-maker HMD knows how to appeal to music lovers, football fans and teens.    HMD brought a plethora of new phones to MWC 2025. Hot on the heels of last year's Barbie flip phone, HMD is back with more niche phones to appeal to those whose preferences and needs fall outside the regular iPhone\/Android flagship binary. Some companies rocked up at Mobile World Congress 2025\u00a0here in Barcelona with no new phones to show off -- but not HMD. It brought its A-game to the mobile show, with a shed-load of fresh products. HMD, short for Human Mobile Devices, is best known for making Nokia phones. Perhaps it's no surprise that the company is once again releasing an update of the classic Nokia phone -- the 3210 -- but this time in the colors of Barcelona Football Club. Read more: MWC 2025: All the Phones, Wearables, Robots and AI Live From Barcelona HMD's partnership with Barcelona has resulted in a number of special edition phones. The company has an ongoing partnership with the elite European soccer team, announcing its first FC Barcelona-themed device last year. This latest update to the 3210 includes hidden messages from players, custom wallpapers and the classic mobile game Snake, this time played on a football pitch. I took it for a whirl at HMD's launch event at Barcelona's Camp Nou Stadium, and it turns out I'm just as bad as ever at the simple but addictive game. The HMD Bar\u00e7a Fusion, meanwhile, is a collector's edition smartphone engraved with the signatures of 11 of the club's star players. HMD also promises Easter eggs that will appeal to fans, and you can even be woken up by the voice of one of your favorite players in the morning. The HMD Bar\u00e7a 3210 will cost \u00a379 in the UK (around $100 converted), and the HMD Bar\u00e7a Fusion will cost \u00a3229 ($290), with exact availability dates and countries still to be confirmed. Read more: MWC 2025 Products You Can Buy Right Now Not a Barcelona fan? One of HMD's other phones might be a better fit for you. The Fusion X1 is the company's first smartphone for teens, created off the back of its Better Phones Project -- an effort to bring families into the process of designing devices. The Fusion X1 allows parents control over kids' phones with a monthly Xplora subscription. This allows parents to control internet browsing and social media, in addition to a School Mode. The subscription also provides continuous location tracking at 20-second intervals with safe zones, emergency SOS calling, low battery alerts and remote device access -- your teen will be thrilled. The Fusion X1 is available for preorder now for \u00a3229 ($290) and will be available from May. The Fusion X1 is a smartphone, but HMD is best known for making feature phones. The feature phone market is declining, but the company says it has defied the overall trend, and last year, it not only gained market share but saw double-digit growth. No wonder, then, that it's back at the show this year with a handful of feature phones. Read more: All the Strange, Bizarre and Wonderful Gadgets and Concepts From MWC Along with the HMD 2660 -- a classic flip phone -- the company unveiled two phones for music lovers. The big selling point of the HMD 150 and 350 is their retro feel, combined with prominent speakers, FM radios and long battery lives make them feel like the perfect festival phones. Let's just hope no one uses those statement speakers to play music on public transport. The HMD 2660 is available now for the low price of \u00a369 ($90), and the HMD 350 and 150 will cost even less, at just \u00a329 ($40). Read more: Best Flip Phones for 2025","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"ByDavid Trainer  ByDavid Trainer , Contributor.  Bank corporate finance building seen from below. The sign \"bank\" visible close. Sky reflecting in ... [+] the glass facade. More Facade pictures below I first made Royal Bank of Canada (RY) a Long Idea in April 2018 and most recently reiterated my bullish thesis on the stock in September 2023. The market isn\u2019t fully appreciating the strength of this business, and its stock remains undervalued. My thesis highlighted Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s diversified business, position as an industry leader, growing net interest margins, and attractive valuation. Today, the company continues to grow its deposits and loans, as well as net interest income and net interest margins. Meanwhile, I think the valuation of the stock is cheap and offers attractive risk\/reward. Royal Bank of Canada has maintained its position as the market share leader in all \u201ckey personal and business banking product categories across Canada\u201d. It is also the #1 ranked investment bank in Canada, the #1 ranked Canadian investment bank in the U.S., and the 10th largest global investment bank based on global investment banking fees according to the company\u2019s fiscal 2024 annual report. As a full-service wealth advisory firm, Royal Bank of Canada is the 6th largest firm in the U.S. when measured by assets under administration (AUA). Last time I wrote about Royal Bank of Canada, the U.S. treasury yield curve was inverted, showing signs of a recession, yet I believed Royal Bank of Canada would be able to maintain its strong net interest margins anyway. Royal Bank of Canada managed to do just that. Now, with inflation decreasing and the U.S. treasury yield reverting to a normal curve, the bank\u2019s net interest margins have increased. At a basic level, a bank makes money when it generates more interest than it pays out. This standard function of a bank grew more difficult in recent years, as interest rates in both the United States and Canada increased. However, Royal Bank of Canada was able to effectively manage its asset base and the rising cost of deposits. In 2024, Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s net interest income (NII) rose to 11% year-over-year (YoY) in fiscal 2024. The bank\u2019s net interest margin followed suit, rising 4 basis points YoY to 1.54%. See Figure 1. As the Bank of Canada and The Federal Reserve consider further rate cuts, any decrease in the cost of deposits could bode well for future increases to the company\u2019s NIM. Figure 1: Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s Net Interest Margin and Net Interest Income: Fiscal 2021 \u2013 Fiscal 2024 RY Net Interest Income And Margin 2021-2024 The success of the business doesn\u2019t come from just one segment. For instance, Royal Bank of Canada grew reported 2024 net income YoY in its Personal Banking, Commercial Banking, Wealth Management, Insurance, and Capital Markets segments. Not only has Royal Bank of Canada improved its net interest margins over the last few years, but the bank is also growing its loans and deposits. In other words, Royal Bank of Canada isn\u2019t just improving its net interest margin on a stagnant balance sheet, it is doing so while growing its book of business. Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s net loans increased from $470 billion in fiscal 2019 to $704 billion in fiscal 2024, or 8.4% compounded annually. Over the same time, the bank\u2019s total deposits grew from $673.3 billion to $1.0 trillion, or 8.5% compounded annually. Figure 2: Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s Net Loans and Deposits: Fiscal 2019 \u2013 Fiscal 2024 RY Loans & Deposits 2019-2024 The strength of Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s business also manifest in the bank\u2019s strong capital ratios. Over the past three years, the bank has averaged a tier 1 common equity (CET1) ratio of 13.4% and averaged a 13.3% CET1 ratio over the past five years. Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s CET1 ratio did fall from 14.5% in fiscal 2023 to 13.2% in fiscal 2024. However, the decrease in the bank\u2019s CET1 ratio is a direct result of the company\u2019s acquisition of HSBC Canada in March 2024, which resulted in a 240-basis point decline in the overall company\u2019s CET1 ratio. This decline was partially offset by an increase in internal capital generation and shares issuances under the company\u2019s dividend reinvestment plan. Longer-term, Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s CET1 ratio has improved from 9.9% in fiscal 2014 to 13.2% in fiscal 2024, per Figure 3. Figure 3: Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s CET1 Ratio: Fiscal 2014 \u2013 Fiscal 2024 RY CET 1 Ratio 2014-2024 Since fiscal 2019, Royal Bank of Canada has paid $28.7 billion (17% of market cap) in cumulative dividends and has increased its quarterly dividends from $0.73\/share in January 2019 to $1.05\/share in January 2025. The company\u2019s current dividend, when annualized, provides a 3.4% yield. The bank also announced a new share buyback program that authorizes the repurchase of 30 million shares June 2024 to June 2025, though repurchases up to this point have been minimal. In fiscal 2024, Royal Bank of Canada repurchased $140 million worth of shares. A similar sized repurchase in 2025 would equate to just 0.1% of the current market cap. Not only does Royal Bank of Canada provide an attractive dividend yield, but its free cash flow (FCF) easily exceeds its dividend payments. Since fiscal 2019 Royal Bank of Canada has generated $29.4 billion in FCF. Longer-term, Royal Bank of Canada has generated a cumulative $58 billion in FCF since fiscal 2014, which represents 32% of its enterprise value. Figure 4: RY Free Cash Flow: Fiscal 2014 \u2013 Fiscal 2024 RY Cumulative FCF 2014-2024 Although inflation has fallen from recent highs, inflationary pressures haven\u2019t disappeared completely. The Fed is taking a slower approach to cutting interest rates. High rates for longer could translate to less financial activity in the economy, which creates a headwind across the entire banking industry. However, at least in the U.S., experts are predicting a much more favorable environment for mergers & acquisitions under the new presidential administration. Such deals could offset any persistent inflation and reduced loan activity in other segments of Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s business. The good news remains that Royal Bank of Canada has proven its ability to generate profits amidst all economic cycles. Even when inflation was higher and economic activity was slower than it is today, Royal Bank of Canada was still growing its loan portfolio while maintaining its margins. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze the future cash flow expectations for different stock price scenarios for Royal Bank of Canada. At its current price, RY\u2019s price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio is 1.0, which means the market expects its NOPAT to never grow from current levels. For reference, Royal Bank of Canada has grown NOPAT 4% compounded annually over both the past five and ten years. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume: the stock would be worth $123\/share today \u2013 nearly equal to the current stock price. In this scenario, Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s NOPAT grows just 1% compounded annually from fiscal 2025 \u2013 fiscal 2034. For reference, Royal Bank of Canada has grown NOPAT by 4% compounded annually over the last decade. If I instead assume: the stock would be worth $151\/share today \u2013 a 24% upside to the current price. In this scenario, Royal Bank of Canada\u2019s NOPAT would grow just 3% compounded annually from fiscal 2025 to 2034. Should the company\u2019s NOPAT grow more in line with historical levels, the stock has even more upside. See Figure 5.

Thing is we have plenty of space for everyone. We're doing pretty well: https:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-... [bbc.co.uk] problem is most of the space is owned by wealthy people leaving no room for everyone else. This is not a problem of supply, it's a problem of wealth concentration. We are NOT going to solve the housing crisis by letting rich people further shit on the environment by concreting over green belt land at knock down prices. Wealth concentration is a huge problem, but so is the poor quality of much of Britain's housing stock, and the unsuitability of it for modern living. We should build on green belt more, but build nice new villages and towns, for first time buyers. Detached spacious homes, passivhaus standard, modern construction methods, fitting in with the landscape. They have a lot of them in Japan and they are fantastic places to live. Once the housing crisis lessens we can look at returning some parts of cities that become under-populated to green spaces. We won't do that of course, but we shouldn't set our sights as low as just making do with the rubbish that we have.   If you want to know why Leeds has no metro it's not because of planning restrictions it's because of a lack of regional government powerful enough to get the money needed to build it.  Also because the conservatives who have historically had an outsized share of power hate anyone who doesn't drive, and frankly Labour isn't far behind. Cars in this country are regarded as the absolute prime form of transport and other forms of transport are ignored at best and demonised at worst.  Meanwhile London looks like it This sounds suspiciously like anti-London shite to me. It's not meant to be anti-London, it's meant to be pointing out that there is a significantly growing divide between London and the rest of the UK. I don't blame Londoners for this - everyone should be advocating for their regions needs since they know them best. I blame the UK government that keeps all power to itself and, being based in London, is only really aware of London's needs.Maybe London should pay for London stuff and everyone else would should pay for their own stuff. That would work great if everyone had been treated roughly equally for the past several decades but they have not. The UK government has been focussed on building the London economy over and above the rest of the country. The result is that London is doing great while elsewhere not so much. This builds resentment on both sides: Londoners asking why they should fund transit projects outside the capital while those outside ask themselves why their taxes should be funding projects in London when their region is getting nothing.Londoners drive less than just about anywhere else, which means this is transportation support for the entire rest of the country. Yes but think for a moment why that is. The only place in the UK with great public transport is London and that's because successive UK governments have supported and built a fantastic public transit system there. If places like Leeds had a transit system that good the chances are that there would be far more people using public transport over driving but there are not because the London-centred government isn't aware of the needs in the different UK regions. The one powerful regional government, the Scottish parliament, has invested millions in improved public transit in Scotland and the result is a better transit system in Edinburgh, Glasgow and between other scottish cities than in Northern England. Try taking the transpennine service sometime - at one point it had about 50% of its trains being cancelled - is it any wonder that people take cars when the trains are that bad?People outside of London consistently vote for cars cars cars cars  As you pointed out both Labour and the Tories are very much car-centric parties so who can you vote for that is not car-centric? Even then when you have no public transit and no money to build any what alternative is there? As I pointed out above, the one powerful regional government that the UK does have has dramatically improved public transit in its region. I suspect that if the UK were to actually devolve power to the regions like every other modern western democracy we'd see far better transit everywhere and far more support for national projects to connect them together, like HS2. As part of that London would definitely still get more transit funding as befits a treasured national capital and transport hub but, funding London exclusively is damaging and divisive to the UK as a whole in a way that, as Brexit showed, goes far beyond just transit. This sounds suspiciously like anti-London shite to me.  It's not meant to be anti-London, it's meant to be pointing out that there is a significantly growing divide between London and the rest of the UK.

Maybe London should pay for London stuff and everyone else would should pay for their own stuff.  That would work great if everyone had been treated roughly equally for the past several decades but they have not. The UK government has been focussed on building the London economy over and above the rest of the country. The result is that London is doing great while elsewhere not so much. This builds resentment on both sides: Londoners asking why they should fund transit projects outside the capital while those outside ask themselves why their taxes should be funding projects in London when their region is getting nothing.

Incorrect. The UK spends more on the roads than it receives in fuel duty receipts. That means none of it goes towards paying for pollution related healthcare costs, or cost of administering drivers and cars. In other words, cars and drivers are subsidized in the UK.

The problem with Brexit was it was never defined what it meant or what the plan was but was pitched as the cure to all these problems we blamed on the EU but were entirely our own doing. Bendy bananas all the way down or something.Well Brexit was famously defined in three simple words: \"Brexit means Brexit\" [bbc.com] which is funny if only because it is an infinite recursion. Having said that, the UK will reap nothing but benefits from marinating in the consequences of Brexit for a generation or two.

The British have had the idea of Brexit buzzing around in their heads since the 1st of January 1973 and they should be given plenty of time to fully explore every conceivable facet of it. Brexit was an additional anvil on the pony's back, but the basic problems were not rebuilding the heavy industrial economy into a high-tech industrial economy (the US hasn't been totally successful at this but has done much better than England*) and transferring most of their wealth into the financialization center of the City.  The latter is the most devastating long-term: whatever financialization and investment capital run by the 0.5% touches it destroys. And it touched most of England. [*] yes, I do mean  Nope, they don't blame Brexit.  They blame land use policy for a lack of private investment. There is no such thing as \"overregulation\" in terms of \"there is some numerical amount of regulations that make it overregulation\", it's just self-actualizing talking points. Everybody has regulations they agree with (Easy one, I think we all agree our water supplies should be tested for lead and bacteria and the law should say they are not acceptable in the potable water supply) and we can all come up with some we don't (for me that is a lot of these that clamp down on housing expansion, minimum parking req  Twice the size of Russia at half the population.

People  wallowing in s!lf-loathing is always a problem. It's hard to find individuals who are able to take a balanced look at themselves, especially under public scrutiny. It's next to impossible to find a whole group of them. Unfortunately each one of those people requires acres of farmland to feed plus somewhere to live and reservoirs to supply their water. You cant bulldoze the entire natural enviroment for that or the whole ecosystem collapses. Britain might have a lot of countryside but almost none of it is unused. Even the mountains have sheep farming. Oh and texas is pretty bloody big. At least they have the monarchy. That should carry them forward.They are worth millions in tourist pounds.

There are lots of empty\/cheap houses in undesirable locations already. The demand for housing is primarily centered around london, and housing costs decrease as you get further away and would have to suffer more commuting time. If you spread things out more and encouraged remote working, things would balance out and housing pressure around london would massively decrease. Everyone in England lives in the south. Besides the Manchester-Liverpool rust belt, most of the rest of the country is empty. Yeah right.

But we also have a higher bedroom to population ratio than most of Europe. We're building plenty of stuff, more than enough, but it's more space for rich people, rather than affordable homes for everyone. Green belts aren't the problem. Overpopulation is not the problem. The problem is wealth concentration. Everything else is a distraction. It's worth also pointing out that one of the authors is a former executive director of the Adam Smith Institute and another works at the Centre for Policy Studies, both of which are conservative \"think tanks\" and might therefore be somewhat biased towards the form of \"free market\" that externalises the awkward costs of simple-minded policies for others to pick up. It's mostly because media and politicians who refuse to even acknowledge the concept of urban containment and it's universality, from the smallest village to the largest city ... if it isn't unincorporated, expansion is almost impossible. The boomers living on the edges in houses they bought half a century ago would scream if urban containment was eliminated, but that's easy enough to ignore. No one is made conscious of how land use restrictions and refusal to expand services are destroying their chances of  We've got green activists to thank for that. For some people a niche frogs are more important than houses for thousands. Kids these days... No one wants to admit that turning housing into an investment causes this.Overregulation certainly didn't help. And an increase in population didn't either. True, we are in something of a trap where we need to increase housing density but that would in turn drive down home prices and existing homeowners are not going to vote for people or support policies that will drive their \"investments\" down, especially for people who purchased homes during higher market peaks and a loss in value would put them upside down.  They have a personal incentive to keep housing stock limited even though for the communities as a whole it's a degradation. My personal feeling is to ge  This is an interesting paper on BTL house prices in particular:   https:\/\/www.bankofengland.co.u... [bankofengland.co.uk]  There's a pretty depressing diagram illustrating the relationship BTL has on the wider economy in \"6: How do pressures on the BTL sector matter for financial stability?\" that shows pretty much any attempt to use policy to lower prices will amplify economic downturns.  We're hooked on housing, essentially.  Unless the build quality is better, tower blocks will be seen as squalid and inconvenient - because they are.  And carrying a baby and the shopping up eleven flights of stairs because the lifts don't work from Friday to Monday is no fun - I speak from experience here. And further increase congestion in the cities... You already have roads which are gridlocked with cars at peak times, and everyone's solution is to cram those people onto trains instead... Only those trains are physically full already at peak times to the extent that you can't physically enter, and if you do manage to get onboard you're packed in so tight that you're physically touching the other passengers. If a couple are both  have low paid and unstable income, then if one loses a job, they get no benefits so long as they live together, and the one that is in a job probably does not earn enough to pay the cost of housing. As a result, it is better for couples to split up so the unemployed one can get benefits,  In Victorian times, several generations of a family would live in a house and spread the risk. A single family member could earn enough to pay the cost of housing. That is not the case today.    A consequence is that the big Victorian house is divided into multiple flats, but ends up housing fewer people, as more of the building is used for kitchens and bathrooms,   People need to understand that the \"benefit scroungers\" are the shareholders of companies which pay so little that their employees are on benefits - and subsidised by the taxes on companies that pay decent wages - while the housing benefits go to the banks (for mortgages) or to the landlords (for tenants) -  who can charge what they like, knowing that housing benefits will pay.    And, of course, not having HS2 reduces the \"risk\" of work moving further north.  Britain is a \"Dimocracy\" - \"Government of the dim, by the dim, for the dim!\" Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the Conservatives rolled back nationalization [socialism] in several areas, such as electricity and gas production. But their efforts to loosen housing policy from the grip of government control was a tremendous failure, especially once it was revealed that Thatcher's head of housing policy himself opposed new housing developments near his home. \"I think housing policy is a major driver of a lot of anti-foreigner, white-supremacist, anti-Black, anti-Muslim attitudes among young people who are frustrated that so-called these people get free houses while they have to live in a bedsit or move somewhere an hour outside the city and commute in,\" Bowman said. US MAGAs are making similar mistakes. NIMBYism is the main cause of difficulty in building new housing*, but slimy politicians blame immigrants and \"socialists\". NIMBYism is simply local democracy in action: locals don't want crowding and get local gov't to invent ways to stop it. Brexit also hurt the UK economy: labor got more expensive as migration was shut down, and trade got more expensive as the EU membership trade discounts are gone. Trump's anti-migrant policies and trade-wars will do very similar. Naive voters fucked themselves.  Morons are getting what they deserve, but unfortunately pull the rest of us with them. * Too bad we can't find a way to distribute population instead of try to stuff everybody and their dog into a few favorite cities. It's a Catch-22 in that the jobs are where the people are, and people go where the jobs are.   US MAGAs are making similar mistakes. NIMBYism is the main cause of difficulty in building new housing*, but slimy politicians blame immigrants and \"socialists\".

[bbc.co.uk]  We have a pretty good ratio of bedrooms to people. Problem is the rich people have all the rooms. Building more of the same is not going to help much at all. E Hell yeah Land Value Tax [wikipedia.org] supporters rise up reads like there is no practical limits on land expansion.  Just keep on taking more, who cares about leaving room for nature.  And makes it sound like energy efficiency as a bad thing!  It's scary head-in-the-sand stuff. I have no idea how accurate that show was... but if it was even remotely accurate.... oh boy... Self inflected scarcity: the real austerity suffered by the non-rich. I think reality TV is about the worst place to go to learn about reality. Also Clarkson is a well known cranky-conservative so I expect all that to get played up on the show, not that it doesn't exist as a problem but we shouldn't accept it as a fair narrative on it's face. Only if you consider it a problem that millions of people have to choose between heat and food. But since you sound like a greenie, you probably think that's OK. There is no shortage. The lights stay on, we don't get brown-outs or rolling blackouts. Our grid is stable. The main issue is the cost, which is forced up by gas prices. Under our system producers bid to supply electricity a day in advance, based on projected demand. The grid buys from the cheapest sources first, which are often renewables that bid zero, and then works its way up to more expensive sources until the demand is met. Then every producer gets the amount bid by the most expensive source, which is  Urban containment has been a left\/right double asskicking of the lower classes. Britain is nothing special, it's hitting Netherlands and Belgium even harder ... with a nice dose of \"just die\" NOx emission and surface water quality laws from the EU to make it worse. Electricity cost is worse too. As I read it, it blamed Thatcher for being a hypocrite: touting the removal of regulations in general, but leaving them in place for housing because the rich, her base, didn't want crowding. AKA: NIMBYism. Because Britain isn't running out of homes for native Brits. In fact, they're running out of native Brits. Most of their population growth is imported - the most popular baby boy name in the UK last year was Mohammed. So are they short on houses for the British, or are they short on homes to put immigrants in, and this is actually an overimmigration problem? Go live in india for a month then tell them you're a native and see how well it goes down. You fucking naive idiot, just like all the rest. The housing problems have little to do with post-war \"green belts\". There are plenty of derelict industrial estates within London proper that could be rehabbed into housing. The problem is the real-estate and banking industry itself, just like it is in the US. We have no shortage of housing, we just don't have affordable housing.A house used to cost 2 years wages for the average worker (1970's) Now the lowest priced houses cost 10-20 times that amount, and the average worker's pay has not increased. It's not a shortage of housing, it's artificial scarcity. It's because people buying up affordable housing not to live there, but to flip for a profit in a year while the market gets hotter. The flippers, real-estate agents, private equity and people who look to suck as much profit out of everything are the problem. There should be rules about buying houses as investment vehicles, especially in middle-class areas. Let the investors buy up the multi-million dollar mansions and industrial properties and make a profit on them. Stay out of the middle-class housing market.https:\/\/www.derelictlondon.com... [derelictlondon.com] I wouldn't mind seeing a 'you have to live in it to own it' rule.  Imagine if apartment building owners had to live in one of the units... they might have themselves a nice penthouse, but they'd be plenty motivated to ensure the entire building was well kept.  Corporations wouldn't be able to own multiple properties, because a corporation is incorporeal. I'm looking at what seem to me like a single article self published blog.

We were promised if we kicked out the illegals or put them in concentration camps, we could take their houses and jobs. Yet unemployment seems to be rising and the cost of housing is even more unattainable for young people. It seems the Nazi formula of putting people in camps or getting rid of them to create short-term jobs didn't work this time around. (Maybe it has something to do with the fact that productivity creates jobs). California declared itself a sanctuary state where none of that is happening at all, yet the problems you're talking about particularly pronounced here. Housing, unemployment, you name it. But don't let me stand in the way of you deciding who is a Nazi as if you're Himmler or something. \"California declared itself a sanctuary state where none of that is happening at all\" That's not what a sanctuary state is. So what is your assertion? California is kicking out illegals? California is rounding them up into concentration camps? Do tell. That's not what a sanctuary state is.You forgot to define it. That would be helpful when trying to refute someone else's assertion. This [ca.gov] site is an example of what California means when it declares itself a \"sanctuary state\".

As long as everyone knows to expect this it is all good, but I suspect many people do not. Well that's fantastically simple and naive. Here's what really happens, backed by a real-world example:  a few years back, my state passed a law saying that farms must pay minimum wage if the worker doesn't at least make minimum wage through piecework (weight of fruit picked) - I think that's something that we ideally would like to see.  However, the actual result of this policy is that there are no more large strawberry growers in the state, which used to be a plentiful and active segment of agriculture, be    If strawberries require less than minimum wage workers, then their cost needs to be adjusted, not labor laws.    This makes the assumption that people are willing to pay any price for strawberries, which is not true.   If strawberries are $12\/lb many fewer people will buy them and the strawberry growers will go out of business.   Now perhaps that is the correct outcome - If strawberries cannot be sold at a price that allows a fair wage for the pickers then the commodity should not be available - But to simpl It still doesn't excuse exploiting people based on their citizenship status.Paying foreigners pennies to build you widgets overseas is not much ethically different from paying foreigners pennies to pick your vegetables locally, other than the former perhaps being more out of sight out of mind.  A more charitable question might be whether these jobs make their lives better or not, and that is much more situational. It still doesn't excuse exploiting people based on their citizenship status.

Vast amounts of money are sucked into dealing with them, and if they earn anything themselves a lot of the earnings are sent back to where they came from.

This article provides a comprehensive outlook on Nio's stock for the coming year, analyzing both opportunities and challenges ahead. Founded in 2014, Nio has quickly established itself as one of China's leading premium electric vehicle manufacturers. The company stands out through its innovative battery-swapping technology, which allows drivers to \"refuel\" their vehicles in minutes rather than hours spent charging. This battery-as-a-service (BaaS) model addresses range anxiety while reducing upfront purchase costs, giving Nio a unique advantage in the competitive EV landscape. It was initially invented in Israel by car manufacturer \u201cBetter Place\u201d and then reinvented using modern battery technology in China a decade later. Nio's product lineup has expanded significantly since its first ES8 premium SUV launched in 2018. The company now offers several models, including the ES6 and EC6 SUVs, the ET7 and ET5 sedans, and the ES7 mid-large SUV. These vehicles target the premium segment, competing directly with offerings from Tesla and traditional luxury automakers while maintaining distinctly Chinese design and technology integration. Beyond vehicles, Nio has created an ecosystem approach through Nio Houses (premium clubhouse-style showrooms), battery swap stations, charging networks and mobile service solutions. As the company continues expanding into European markets, including Norway, Germany, and the Netherlands, this holistic approach to customer engagement is a key differentiator in an increasingly crowded marketplace. Nio's financial trajectory shows promising growth yet serious ongoing challenges as the company invests heavily in expansion and technology development. Nio's financial metrics reflect significant challenges, particularly in profitability and debt management. The company reported a net margin of -38.02% and an operating margin of -41.83%, highlighting its struggle to generate sustainable profits. With negative earnings per share (-13.74 EPS for FY 2023), Nio remains deeply unprofitable, though analysts estimate improvement in 2024 (-7.45 EPS). The company also carries a high debt load, with total debt to total equity at 197.21% and long-term debt to total capital at 30.47%, suggesting a reliance on borrowing to fund operations. While its current ratio (1.22) and quick ratio (1.12) indicate it can cover short-term obligations, the company's cash burn rate raises concerns about future liquidity. From a valuation perspective, Nio remains in a difficult position. Due to continued losses, the stock has no P\/E ratio, and its price-to-sales ratio of 2.04 suggests it is valued moderately relative to revenue. However, its enterprise value to EBITDA of -3.28 and return on equity of -85.09% indicate serious inefficiencies in capital deployment. Revenue per employee stands at $1.87 million, but income per employee is troubling - $711,985, reinforcing how unprofitable its operations remain. Despite a modest gross margin of 2.98%, weak asset turnover (0.52) and heavy capital expenditures ($9.32B) make profitability an uphill battle. Unless Nio significantly scales revenue while cutting costs, its financial health will remain fragile, with dilution or further debt likely necessary to sustain operations. Despite its ambitious expansion in the EV market, Nio's financial health remains precarious. The company reported $2.6 billion in revenue last quarter, but a $721 million net loss highlights its ongoing struggle to achieve profitability. With $6 billion in cash and equivalents, Nio has the liquidity to sustain operations in the short term. Still, its cash burn rate may require additional funding within 2-3 years, raising the risk of shareholder dilution. Additionally, J.P. Morgan recently cut revenue and earnings forecasts for 2025 by 7-13%, reflecting concerns over slower-than-expected vehicle deliveries and Nio\u2019s ability to scale. While the company aims to double sales to 440,000 units in 2025, analysts estimate a more conservative 334,000-unit target, suggesting potential shortfalls ahead. Despite these financial pressures, Nio is betting on new product launches to drive growth, including its high-end ET9 sedan, mass-market ONVO SUVs, and budget-friendly Firefly models. The company\u2019s battery-swapping technology differentiates it from competitors, potentially giving it a strategic edge. However, the broader EV market is becoming increasingly competitive, with BYD, Xiaomi, Geel, and Xpeng emerging as stronger players. J.P. Morgan downgraded Nio to Neutral and slashed its price target to $4.70 from $7, reflecting a more cautious stance. Ultimately, Nio\u2019s financial stability depends on its ability to scale profitably and reduce cash burn\u2014if it fails, further stock price declines could follow. Nio\u2019s stock performance over the past 12 months has been brutal for investors, reflecting ongoing financial struggles and weakening market confidence. The stock has plunged nearly 50% as disappointing earnings, downward revenue revisions, and concerns over cash burn have weighed heavily on sentiment. Analysts have slashed 2024 EPS estimates by 63% and cut revenue forecasts by 19%, reinforcing doubts about Nio\u2019s ability to scale profitably. J.P. Morgan recently downgraded the stock to Neutral and lowered its price target to $4.70 from $7, citing weaker-than-expected delivery growth and increasing competition from Chinese EV giants like BYD and Xiaomi. With the stock down 93% from its 2021 peak, investors remain skeptical about whether Nio can turn its fortunes around or if further declines are ahead. Several key factors will likely influence Nio's stock performance in the coming year, from industry-wide trends to company-specific developments. Global EV sales are projected to reach over 20 million units in 2025, with China remaining the world's largest market. Government policies worldwide continue supporting the transition to electric mobility, creating favorable conditions for Nio's domestic and international expansion plans. China's ongoing support for new energy vehicles and Europe's stricter emissions standards provide tailwinds for Nio's core markets. The company's premium positioning may help insulate it from subsidy reductions while allowing it to capture increasingly EV-friendly consumer preferences. Nio's next-generation battery technology and autonomous driving capabilities represent potential catalysts for 2025. The company's continued investment in battery swap infrastructure provides a unique selling proposition, particularly as charging speed and convenience remain key consumer concerns. Advancements in Nio's autonomous driving platform could create additional value through software subscription services, potentially improving margins and creating recurring revenue streams beyond vehicle sales. The premium EV segment continues growing more competitive, with traditional luxury automakers accelerating their electric offerings while Tesla maintains its dominant position. Nio's current market share in China's premium EV segment stands at approximately 20% , and maintaining this position while expanding internationally will be crucial. Nio's unique battery swap network and brand loyalty may provide competitive advantages. Still, the company faces challenges from domestic competitors like XPeng and Li Auto and international brands like BMW and Mercedes-Benz introducing compelling electric vehicles. Despite its ongoing losses, analysts remain cautious but optimistic about Nio\u2019s long-term potential. The stock currently has an \"Overweight\" rating. Earnings projections suggest deep losses ahead, with 2024 EPS estimated at -$7.45, improving to - $4.56 in 2025 and - $2.84 in 2026. While some high-end estimates forecast a return to profitability by 2026 ($3.71 EPS), lower-end projections show continued heavy losses. Given its history of earnings misses and downward revisions, investors remain wary about Nio\u2019s ability to turn around its financials. Further downward revisions could follow if it fails to control cash burn and meet delivery targets. Despite its growth potential, Nio faces several significant challenges that investors should consider. Evolving regulations in both China and international markets present both opportunities and risks. China will continue its electric vehicle (EV) subsidy program in 2025. The government has renewed its auto trade-in subsidies, allowing consumers to receive up to 20,000 yuan (approximately $2,650) when exchanging old vehicles for new energy vehicles. . Meanwhile, European data security regulations and emissions standards could impact Nio's expansion strategy and compliance costs. Trade tensions between China and Western markets also pose potential challenges for Nio's international ambitions, particularly regarding technology export controls and tariffs. Access to critical battery materials and semiconductors remains a potential constraint on production. While extreme shortages have eased, price volatility for lithium, nickel and other key materials could pressure margins. Nio's advanced driver-assistance systems require sophisticated chips, making the company vulnerable to industry-wide supply constraints. Macroeconomic uncertainties, including inflation pressures and potential recession risks, could impact consumer demand for premium vehicles. Rising interest rates have already pressured growth stock valuations and further monetary tightening could disproportionately affect companies like Nio that aren't yet profitable. As a Chinese company with growing international operations, Nio also faces currency risks that could impact reported financial results and operating costs across its markets. Nio faces a make-or-break year in 2025 as it battles intense competition, ongoing financial struggles, and the need to scale profitably. While China\u2019s renewed EV subsidies could provide some support, Nio must prove it can grow sales without excessive cash burn. Deliveries are expected to increase, driven by new models like the ONVO L60 SUV and the Firefly compact sedan, but profitability remains a challenge, with continued losses projected. With competition from BYD, Xiaomi, and Xpeng heating up, Nio must execute flawlessly to regain market confidence. If it fails to improve efficiency and control spending, further financial strain and potential dilution could be on the horizon. Bottom Line Nio stands at a critical juncture heading into 2025, balancing significant growth opportunities against challenges in an increasingly competitive industry. The company\u2019s premium positioning, innovative technology, and expanding global footprint provide a foundation for potential outperformance if execution remains strong. However, investors should weigh these positives against profitability concerns and macroeconomic uncertainties. For those accepting the inherent volatility, Nio offers exposure to global mobility transformation\u2014but requires patience and a long-term perspective. Nio\u2019s growth stems from its premium brand positioning, innovative battery swap technology and ecosystem approach that extends beyond vehicle sales to include charging infrastructure and community building. Nio differentiates itself through battery swap technology, premium customer service and community focus, while Tesla maintains manufacturing scale and software advantages. Unlike traditional automakers, Nio benefits from purpose-built EV architecture without legacy system constraints. Key risks include continued unprofitability, intense competition, regulatory challenges in China and international markets and macroeconomic factors affecting premium vehicle demand and growth stock valuations.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"ByDavid Trainer  ByDavid Trainer , Contributor.  Munich, Bavaria Germany - December 11 2022: Amazon Deutschland Services GmbH e-commerce german ... [+] headquarters office building with glass green trademark logo. Ultra HD During a recent client meeting, I talked about Amazon (AMZN) and did a deep dive into its valuation. The results were shocking. When you look under the hood of the stock\u2019s valuation, you see that the market\u2019s expectations for future cash flows are shockingly high. Shocking. Let\u2019s get specific Expectations Investing Analysis on AMZN As I do for all of my Reverse DCF Case Studies, I use my firm\u2019s valuation models to quantify the future performance of the company required to justify its current stock price. Specifically, my model shows that to justify ~$239\/share Amazon would have to: Let\u2019s put some context around those expectations. Benchmarking Expectations for AMZN First, growing revenue at 10.9% CAGR for 39 years means Amazon\u2019s revenue would be $32.2 trillion in 2063. $32.2. trillion is 26% greater than the United States\u2019 GDP in 2024. $32.2. trillion would also rank Amazon as the third largest GDP in the world in 2063. See Figure 1 for details. Figure 1: Comparing Amazon\u2019s Revenue to the GDP of the Largest Countries in the World Comparing AMZN Revenue To GDP Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings. 2024 GDP stats from Global PEO Services  *2063 GDP values assume a 4% nominal compounded annual growth rate. It is important to note that the stock price embeds expectations for revenue reaching $32.2 trillion while Amazon \u2013 also \u2013 increases its ROIC from 14% to 64%. I think there are several reasons why the expectations embedded in Amazon\u2019s current stock price are too high. Competitive Realities Large revenue growth, like what\u2019s embedded in Amazon\u2019s stock price, implies significant market share gains. I note that market share gains are typically won with lower prices, which are not possible with a company that must also increase its ROIC to very high levels. Specifically, a 14% ROIC ranks 135th in the S&P 500 while a 64% ROIC ranks 11th, behind firms like Apple (AAPL), Mastercard (MA) and Nvidia (NVDA). In other words, Amazon\u2019s stock price is implying a doubly-incredible future where the company enjoys huge revenue growth and ROIC improvement as well. Currently, only one company, Apple, ranks in the top 10 of the S&P 500 for ROIC (7th) and revenue (3rd). Amazon\u2019s trailing 12 months revenue ($620 billion) ranks #2 in the S&P 500, just behind Walmart (WMT) at $674 billion. For reference, Walmart\u2019s ROIC is 11%. So, hypothetically, Amazon would only need to dramatically improve its ROIC rank to join Apple as one of the few companies to rank so highly for ROIC and revenue at the same time. Expectations Investing Applied Too few investors have the tools to unveil the details behind stock valuations. I make it clear and easy. Math is math. It\u2019s not supposed to be hard. Wall Street wants to keep you in the dark by making you think it is too hard to get the truth about valuation. I shed light into the dark corners of the market and make them into opportunities to profit. I think the MOMO, YOLO, SPAC, NFT, meme stock and meme coin trading ploys are bad for investors, bad for our stock market, and bad for our country. I\u2019m here to give you proven-superior investment research that is good for the long-term health of your portfolio and your peace of mind.","label":1}

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"Take this quick survey to help Digiday improve our products & be entered to win a $50 gift card. In recent weeks, the ad tech sector\u2019s leading lights have issued their financial results for the closing quarter of 2024 \u2014 traditionally, the big-money period of the financial year \u2014 and while almost all reported numbers that were up and to the right, the markets reacted negatively. The year 2025 has been widely touted as a comeback year for mergers and acquisitions, and even some initial public offerings, in ad tech, although Wall Street\u2019s reactions to the latest round of earnings calls from companies in the sector will likely prove a drag on valuations. For example, revenues for the sector\u2019s big two, i.e., AppLovin and The Trade Desk, issued double-digit annual revenue increases (44% and 26%, respectively), but the slings and arrows of the public markets resulted in precipitous price declines in recent weeks. In the case of The Trade Desk, falling short of its earlier earnings guidance meant its market capitalization lost billions of dollars in value in the space of a day, and in recent weeks, with its plan to regain momentum likely to stimulate many talking points in the year ahead. And in the case of AppLovin, the gravitational pull on its stock price came from different means. The company\u2019s stock price reached an all-time high after it issued its latest quarterly earnings, with the company\u2019s advertising division doing so well that it announced plans to sell its app development division for $900 million to focus on media, which boomed 73% in Q4.However, the stock declined by as much as 20% in the days after reports from short-seller firms Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research alleging unethical practices, including ad fraud and data theft \u2014 AppLovin denies these claims. Meanwhile, Taboola\u2019s market fortunes experienced a similar pattern to The Trade Desk\u2019s in recent weeks, issuing 23% full-year revenue growth for 2024. But its forecasted earnings for 2025 fell below expectations, resulting in a double-digit price decline in the days afterward. This is despite Taboola expanding its operations, with the company (which founded its business on native ad units) telling Business Insider that it is going to enter the display advertising business in the year ahead, giving it a total addressable market value of $55 billion in its own estimation. Elsewhere, the recently disclosed earnings of Magnite and PubMatic are a likely indication of why the public markets aren\u2019t necessarily thrilled by the fortunes of display advertising right now. Both companies issued single-digit revenue increases for the closing quarter of 2024 last week \u2014\u00a0Magnite\u2019s revenue increased 4%, while PubMatic\u2019s was up 9%. Although an observed \u201ccratering\u201d of Magnite\u2019s CPMs during the period prompted one analyst to ask, \u201cIs the open internet healthy?\u201d DoubleVerify has unveiled policy and product updates as part of its News Accelerator program to reduce the impact of keyword blocklists on publishers.

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"     RealMe's concept blurs the line between a phone and a professional camera.    This RealMe concept phone has a large camera lens as it is, but you can swap in an even bigger one. For many people, buying a phone is equivalent to buying a personal camera. But Chinese phone-maker RealMe is blurring that line with a concept device that lets you change the lens on the phone, much like on a high-end mirrorless camera. RealMe's Interchangeable-lens concept phone does exactly what the name implies and is on display at\u00a0Mobile World Congress 2025\u00a0in Barcelona. You can attach a full-frame mirrorless lens directly onto the device, letting you enhance the zoom or use different lenses for creative shots. The RealMe phone has an adapter that allows you to mount professional-level lenses that attach to much more expensive standalone cameras like a Leica M11 or Canon R6. You could even use some old DSLR lenses if you have any still around. RealMe's Interchangeable-lens concept allows for DSLR lenses to be attached to the phone for enhanced photography. RealMe says the concept uses a 1-inch type customized Sony sensor (the sensor isn't actually an inch in size) paired with a proprietary lens mount system. If such a phone ever comes to the market, it could allow for high-quality photography that can be quickly edited or backed up to cloud services using the phone. The sensor is similar to the one used in the Xiaomi 15 Ultra\u00a0and RealMe's concept is like the one Xiaomi showed off in 2022 with the 12S Ultra's 1-inch type sensor. This year at MWC, Xiaomi showed off a new concept of a full-sized camera lens that houses an even larger image sensor and attaches magnetically to the back of a Xiaomi 15 phone. The concept is similar to the\u00a0QX100\u00a0lens\/sensor combo that Sony sold in 2013 that could clip to the back of a phone. Relatedly, RealMe is also showing off an AI voice-based image retoucher, which promises to let you edit a photo by speaking with a voice assistant. The Interchangeable-lens concept also reminds me of the Samsung Galaxy Camera from over a decade ago, which put Android inside of a point-and shoot camera. However, we haven't seen any similar devices crop up since, with Samsung instead reserving its highest-end camera ambitions for phones like the $1,300 Galaxy S25 Ultra.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"     These new cheap phones get specs like a 108-megapixel camera that is normally seen on more expensive phones. Here's everything to know about the TCL 60 series of phones.    The TCL 60 NxtPaper includes a 108-megapixel main camera. The TCL 60 series of phones is expanding, the company revealed Monday at Mobile World Congress 2025. TCL highlighted its plans internationally for\u00a0lower-cost phone models that have a 108-megapixel main camera, more NxtPaper displays that mimic e-readers and big 5,200-mAh batteries with 18-watt wired charging. The TCL 60 series first debuted in January at CES 2025 with the $200 TCL 60 XE NxtPaper 5G that will head to the US market later this year. The TCL 60 XE will be joined by several variations of both TCL's NxtPaper devices and phones with traditional displays that are set for release in Asia, Europe and Latin American markets. Read more: MWC 2025: All the Phones, Wearables, Robots and AI Live From Barcelona The TCL 60 SE NxtPaper 5G. The TCL 60 SE NxtPaper 5G has a 6.7-inch display, 5,200-mAh battery, support for AI tools like a writing assistant, an IP54 rating for splash and dust resistance and 18GB of memory paired up with 256GB of storage. That phone will cost 189 euros, which roughly converts to $195. The TCL 60 NxtPaper -- without any additional letters in its name -- has a larger 6.8-inch display, a 108-megapixel main camera (which we rarely see in these price ranges) and up to 512GB of internal storage. Like the SE phone, it will also include 18GB of memory and a 5,200-mAh battery. That phone will cost 199 euros. TCL's NxtPaper phones change to an eReader-like mode by tapping a button. TCL's non-NxtPaper devices range in price from 109 euros to 169 euros. On the low end of this price range is the TCL 605 which has 128GB of storage, a 50-megapixel main camera and a 5,200-mAh battery. While on the higher-end are the TCL 60 5G and TCL 60 SE. The 60 SE has a 6.67-inch display, a 50-megapixel main camera, 8GB of memory and 512GB of storage. The 60 5G -- without any additional letters -- gets a 6.8-inch display with a 120Hz refresh rate, runs on a MediaTek Dimensity 6300 processor and has 6GB of memory along with 256GB of storage. The entire TCL 60 series unveiled at MWC 2025. While most of these phones aren't coming to the US, this lineup does give a few hints about what could be coming to phones that cost $200 and less from TCL and other phone companies. For the last few years, phone batteries in these lower-cost phones have kept to 5,000 mAh -- which as it is often last a full day -- but companies like OnePlus are starting to push those capacities even higher in more expensive phones. Its promising to see that lower-cost devices can start bumping up the battery capacity. Read more: 5 MWC 2025 Products You Can Actually Buy Right Now","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"Some of our devices look like they\u2019re straight out of hacker movies. For instance, how about a small board you plant behind an RFID reader, collecting access card data and then replaying it when you next walk up the door? [Jakub Kramarz] brings us perhaps the best design on the DIY market, called The Tick \u2013 simple, flexible, cheap, tiny, and fully open-source. Take off the reader, tap into the relevant wires and power pins (up to 25V input), and just leave the board there. It can do BLE or WiFi \u2013 over WiFi, you get a nice web UI showing you the data collected so far, and letting you send arbitrary data. It can do Wiegand like quite a few open-source projects, but it can also do arbitrary clock+data protocols, plus you can just wire it up quickly, and it will figure out the encoding. We could imagine such a board inside a Cyberpunk DnD rulebook or used in Mr Robot as a plot point, except that this one is real and you can use it today for red teaming and security purposes. Not to say all applications would be NSA-catalog-adjacent pentesting \u2013 you could use such a bug to reverse-engineer your own garage door opener, for one. Simple replay attacks don\u2019t work on any modern \u2018real\u2019 access card system any more, which use a credential and key exchange and crypto processor in the card. So, using one of these, how long would it take to crack the crypto on, say, a middle-of-the-road HID iClass card? (asking for a friend\u2026) Sometimes you don\u2019t really have to try that hard. We once had a brand new intern who was tasked with documenting all of the computer hardware currently present in a building just down the street from our main facility. Off he went, by himself, badge in hand to a location he\u2019d not been to before. Upon his return, we were puzzled by some of the assets recorded on his list as they were a brand that we didn\u2019t buy. Later in the day, one of our regular employees noticed a police presence around the next suite over from ours in the same building where the intern had dutifully walked around earlier and recorded the brand, model, and serial number of the computer equipment. This other suite housed a secure logistics operation of some sort. Upon conversing with the police, our guy found out that some unknown person had, earlier that day, been observed walking around in their facility taking notes. Upon putting two and 2 together, and getting the intern\u2019s account of his morning\u2019s activities, our guy brought the intern\u2019s badge to the other company\u2019s main door and effortlessly scanned in. He then proceeded to do the same with his own badge as well as one of our other employee\u2019s badges. That\u2019s what happens, I guess, when you configure your access control system to open the door in the presence of any badge. I don\u2019t really remember who the intern was at this point, but I\u2019ll bet after his conversation with the local constabulary, he remembers us. (Nothing happened to the kid as his only mistake was not reading the suite number. It was a fairly short conversation, since our guy demonstrated that any old badge of the correct type opened the door. I\u2019m sure eyes were opened at the logistics company.) Many years ago, I was attending a demonstration of a new OS given by a certain company whose name might be the opposite of \u2018macro\u2019 and \u2018hard\u2019. In the next room, they had several server racks behind a large glass window, clearly designed to wow business clients. These were protected by a single door and a badge reader. One of my coworkers walked up to the door and used his badge, which caused the reader to happily admit him access to the racks. No, we were not employees of said company \u2013 our employer was just one of many customers of theirs. Long ago, deep in a forgotten forest, an ancient witch bestowed upon me a gift\u2014a rod, carved from the heart of a fallen thunderstrike oak, humming with unseen power. \u201cThis will open any door bound by lightning\u2019s touch,\u201d she whispered before vanishing into the mist. I thought it nonsense\u2014until I found myself before a towering steel door, its badge reader glowing like an unblinking eye. With nothing to lose, I tapped the rod against it. A spark danced, the light blinked green, and the door slid open with a silent bow. One by one, barriers fell before me. Server rooms, vaults, entire fortresses of glass and steel\u2014all yielded to the witch\u2019s gift. No alarms rang, no guards stirred. I walked through the world as if it had never learned to say no to me. Often enough it was like this in the late 80s \u2013 early 00\u2019s. People were sold on cheap access to security systems used by the military!11!, it must be better!, right? Only without the same protocols and trying to underpay on implementation yields predictable results. Ever been in a secure location when an unaffiliated employee accidentally wanders in from a utility access they were working inside? It was actually that bad. You may have heard of a group of notorious military penetration testers, their stories were enabled by this kind of thing, when base administrators made the same mistakes a decade earlier. I\u2019ve worked with access control and I\u2019ve seen this happen. You don\u2019t need to \u201cprogram\u201d anything, it\u2019s a simple misconfiguration, at least sometimes, may a stray checkbox. And you may not notice it because, hey, you grant people access and they get in, so what\u2019s the problem? Until you try to turn somebody\u2019s access off, which is when you find out. IIRC it\u2019s not just any old card, but a compatible one (obviously) with the right facility code: anybody who seems to be associated with your facility can access certain doors, no questions asked. 125 kHz HID Proxcards are still in wide use \u2013 hell, my current employer uses them. I\u2019m fully aware of what they\u2019re using, given that I have my badge stored on my FZ, and the FZ works to let me into the office (got to keep the dolphin happy! ;) ). This device appears to be aimed at these common access controls. Most environments I\u2019ve ever tested in recent years still use good ol\u2019 fashion Wiegand, totally unencrypted.  The protocol does not have any notion of a nonce\u2019s or replay protection.  There are newer, encrypted protocols and most modern badge readers even support them, but they are almost never configured because the cert configuration \/ management is a pain in the ass. Project author here. In the photos you can see the implant attached to quite modern HID iCLASS SE reader, supporting HID SEOS credentials thanks to its embedded iCLASS SE Processor. The reader does establish cryptographically secure channel with the card, performs cryptographically strong authentication and decrypts cryptographically secure credential from the modern card and then, proceeds to send it unencrypted over the wires using Wiegand protocol. To mitigate you can buy an OSDP backpack and replace half of your EACS system to support OSDP or switch to new Signo line. In a proper installation any keycard access is answered by both the system and a person inside with at least a camera view of you. The keys you are asking abought are between card and reader. This goes between reader and door controller where the data is plain text. Similar devices have been on the market for some time and are relatively inexpensive. Definitely not the case here.  HIDglobal states the encryption is end-to-end, from the card to the remote (and secure) server.  The reader passes encrypted data, and does not perform the authentication itself. I\u2019d say there are already 4 or 5 similar public projects, and the first one was released almost 20 years ago. The difference? Most will go into magic smoke when connected to a 24V long-range reader, unless connected through additional DC-DC converter. I wonder how many projects are called \u201cThe Tick\u201d  we built one at my last company that was designed to allow us to spin a shaft until the index on the encoder kicked.  then it would count ticks and display where the shaft was in its rotation. Between the blog title, color of the stains on the hot plate, the color of the pcbs, and the name of the device, I thought this post was about a device that was implanted under someone\u2019s skin to perform espionage.  I\u2019m glad I was wrong because implanting those boards would be painful. I thought this too. Maybe it was a suppository? Almost: the stains are permanently embedded leftovers of some card reader, that served as parts donor for other project. You can follow that other journey on Iceman\u2019s discord server.

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4060 has officially become the most widely used graphics card among gamers on Steam, thanks to its affordable price and solid performance for 1080p gaming. According to the latest Steam Hardware and Software Survey, the budget-friendly GPU has steadily gained traction since its mid-2023 launch, appealing to casual gamers, esports players, and budget-conscious PC builders. For years, older budget GPUs like the GTX 1650 and RTX 3060 dominated Steam\u2019s charts. However, the RTX 4060 has now surpassed both, securing the top position with an 8.57% market share in February 2025. Its rise can be attributed to competitive pricing (around $300-$350), low power consumption, and modern gaming features like DLSS 3 and ray tracing support. Compared to its predecessor, the RTX 3060, the RTX 4060 offers improvements in ray tracing, DLSS 3 frame generation, and overall efficiency. While some criticized its 8GB VRAM and narrower memory bus, it remains a solid choice for 1080p gaming, which aligns with the majority of Steam users\u2019 setups. At the time of writing, the RTX 4060 is available anywhere from $300 to $350, which is similar to the RTX 3060. The RTX 3060, previously a dominant choice, now holds 6.87% of the market, reflecting a 1.67% increase from the previous month. The RTX 4060 Ti has also seen significant growth, rising by 3.11% to reach a 6.56% share. Similarly, the RTX 4070 experienced a 2.54% increase, bringing its total to 5.43%. The latest survey results highlight Nvidia\u2019s overwhelming control of the PC gaming GPU market. The company occupies nearly all of the top spots, with AMD and Intel struggling to make significant gains in the consumer segment. Even as Nvidia moves forward with its RTX 50-series launch later this year, the affordability and accessibility of the RTX 4060 keep it relevant for budget-conscious gamers. As newer graphics cards hit the market, including the RTX 50-series and AMD\u2019s Radeon 9000 range, it will be interesting to see if the RTX 4060 can maintain its lead or if another mid-range option will dethrone it in the coming months. Buying a new GPU in this generation is a bit of a tricky minefield of graphics cards to steer clear of. Sometimes, the performance is there, but the value is not; other times, you could get something much more capable for the same amount of money. While Nvidia makes some of the best GPUs, it's certainly no stranger to that performance vs. value dilemma. Below, I'll show you three Nvidia graphics cards you're better off avoiding right now and tell you their much better alternatives. RTX 4060 Ti AMD and Nvidia are always competing when it comes to producing the best graphics card of the year. It's safe to say that they both always try, but AMD's latest attempt feels like it may seriously backfire. The new RX 7600 XT feels like an attempt to fix problems with the original RX 7600, but it ends up being something that Nvidia should be sending AMD a fruit basket for. AMD repeated Nvidia's mistakes Nvidia's RTX 40-series is, for the most part, a success. The addition of DLSS 3 made the lower-tier cards really pop, and the flagship RTX 4090 offers a massive generational uplift. But Nvidia made a couple of mistakes with this generation, and surprisingly, AMD repeated them both with the RX 7600 XT. The RTX 4070 Ti Super and RX 7900 XT are unlikely rivals when shopping for the best graphics card in 2024. Price shifting and market repositioning have placed these two GPUs in direct competition, both targeting gamers looking for a premium 4K gaming experience without spending over $1,000. Both graphics cards hit the mark, offering a smooth frame rate at 4K with all the settings cranked up. The differences between them lie in features and pricing.

When you use accelerated video, you have to move to grabbing the final framebuffer directly instead of the one that doesn't have the video composited on top of it. GPUs normally allow you to do this. Apple's GPU driver might not permit it at all. This is why disabling video acceleration in Chrome allowed you to screenshot videos played there. Apple is presumably always using GPU acceleration and may even be processing the DRM itself on the GPU. This is abusive to the user and it prevents you from exercising your fair use rights, and it's also probably intentional. But Apple also didn't have to go out of their way to accomplish it. All they had to do was not go out of their way to enable you to exercise your rights, in the name of 1) simplicity and 2) protection of the interests of others who are not you. As TFS says, Microsoft does problematic things around DRM as well, and will only continue to ratchet that up over time.

You'd implied previously that Apple might not allow any screen shots of hardware-accelerated video.  I took that screen shot while the video was playing, and I know that app uses hardware playback because software rendering chews through the battery like nobody's business.So, the capability is absolutely there.

So, the capability is absolutely there.  Apple is specifically just not allowing it for DRM content. Does it matter? Your premise was that this was potentially unintentional result of hardware acceleration. If it's blocked for one hardware accelerated form of content and not the other then it's not the result of hardware acceleration. No we do care about the reasons, you're just moving the goalposts around. You're saying one then and then pretending you said another. The reason you postulated: hardware acceleration is clearly not the reason. You haven't shown that at all, you've only shown that you don't know how the system works. The question is, does the driver prevent grabbing the final frame buffer does the hardware not allow a way to get with  DMA. Unless I am mistaken Apple does not package their 'GPU' in a non-integrated part so it seems possible there might be some restrictions, not necessarily put there to block or prevent anything but because it simplified the design, and they don't need flexibility because they don't have to work with anyone else's parts. According to Apple's FairPlay developer documentation [apple.com], once decrypted the content is passed through the same decoder as if you were playing back non-DRM content.  The difference is that with DRM content a HDCP flag is set, which is likely what Apple is checking for, and if it is present, the screen capture function returns a big ol' picture of nothing.

Remember how back in the day if you transferred your music to an iPod there was no functionality built into iTunes to send the music files back to your computer?  That ended up biting some people in the ass when they mistakenly believed the iPod doubled as a backup for their music collection.  Yeah, I know third party software eventually made it possible, but we're talking about people who bought a device expecting everything to \"just work.\" Of course, when you factor in that Apple basically has to stay in the good graces of the RIAA and MPAA lest the terms of their licensing deals be altered (think Darth Vader style), it's not surprising that they've taken a heavy-handed approach to what you're allowed to do with DRMed content. Ironically, the protection behind all this content has been quite broken for some time.  Pick up a generic HDMI splitter and one of the various cheap HDMI capture cards capable of 1080p60 capture and you can literally record whatever you want.  Most people don't bother with this method though, because the actual scene group pirates have tools for directly ripping streams, and then it's up for grabs as a torrent.  Being able to record from a streaming service can still be useful, if for example, for some strange reason you're the only person who wants a copy of an extremely unpopular Disney movie and Disney Plus is the only service that has it in HD.  .

My experience with DisplayLink is hit and miss - I had an ancient USB 2 -> DVI that worked with everything. But my latest USB 3 -> HDMI one, Linux detected it somewhat but I had to download and compile a kernel module via DKMS to get audio out. It didn't work correctly with Windows 11, even with the official driver download - would detect the monitor but display nothing on screen. Funnily enough it works okay (mirroring) on Android. I have no experiences on Mac with DisplayLink but drivers aren't quite  Those DisplayLink adapters have always been kinda janky on Mac, probably due to the drivers (which come from DisplayLink, not Apple). Very touchy, tending to go wonky every time there's an update to the system software, and then you have to wait until they release new drivers to compensate. I stay away from them whenever possible. Just don't use macos, then you don't need shitty displaylink. All of the non-novelty OSes support MST. Apple owns a streaming service; Microsoft does not. For 30+ years I've watched PC makers and the movie etc. industries try to stop people watching things they have legitimately purchased a licence to watch because some people use those avenues to piracy. Everything from Macrovision to DVDCSS, to HDMI blacklisting to this nonsense where content won't show on secondary monitors, etc. Hilariously, not once in those same 30 years, have those who pirate not been able to get a perfect copy of whatever content they want, even if that was a few months after the release. The amount of money poured into this junk is just not worth it.  The day a thing is released in the cinema, or Netflix or whatever, it's available online.  They're literally punishing billions of people, for the sake of slightly hindering a few tens of people who pretty much aren't affected by such measures at all. The longer I live, the more derivative, formulaic, and frankly, shitty, mass produced entertainment gets. Movies, television, online, whatever, it all sucks throbbing purple donkey dick. It's not worth paying for, certainly, and even free is overpriced. It's not worth the time to watch unless they pay me, and I'm expensive. So in the end, to borrow from The Eight Deadly Words [tvtropes.org], I don't care what happens to these companies. Hilariously, not once in those same 30 years, have those who pirate not been able to get a perfect copy of whatever content they want, even if that was a few months after the release.Actually we have ample evidence that DRM has worked effectively for quite some significant durations in more recent iterations.  Look to example BD+. It was not only nearly a full year between BluRay's release and the first example of someone playing a copy, but it wasn't even cracked and relied on a specific piece of broken software which then only worked for some specific titles and was patched in future releases shortly after. It was several full years before the playback of BD+ protected titles were pos  Hilariously, not once in those same 30 years, have those who pirate not been able to get a perfect copy of whatever content they want, even if that was a few months after the release.

If it's just to cover that little release-to-compromise window, then you could argue it was cost-effective, but that's NOT what it's for.  It's to control and profiteer off all content. Which is why every certified HDMI device of a thousand different kinds have HDMI blacklisting, why every PC and tablet have TPMs and why every single DVD made after a given time includes CSS for no real reason - even movies that literally never made it onto DVD until long after the format was obsolete. Also, after BD was compromised they came up with BD+, and that was compromised (how doesn't matter, it was compromised) and then from then on - 4K versions of those movies (some of which were decades old) were available forever. It's nothing to do with the release window.  It's to do with controlling literally everything from the day of release to decades after the format is obsolete.  It is - again - punishing billions of people in perpetuity for the few pirates who honestly couldn't care less anyway. Gaming is no different.  There are some games that removed Denuvo only YEARS after the games were utterly compromised and widely available on illicit channels, but many didn't.  Some still haven't done so. It's handing control in perpetuity to something that was broken long before most people ever bought that movie \/ game anyway, and modifying literally every device that COULD touch it in any way to facilitate that functionality, even if it's a hindrance (e.g. Denuvo has been recorded with STUPENDOUS performance degradation to the game, and again the pirated versions didn't have that). It is ludicrous that we have allowed things like HDMI ports on every machine in existence to take part in this profiteering - and we're paying for that to be there on behalf of the industry through licensing fees on every port \/ chip - when not one title out there is \"uncopyable\". So tell me... at what point after it's pirated do they turn that stuff off (they don't)Of course they don't. Why would they? They've already spent money on putting DRM in, why spend more money to pull DRM out after it is broken? It's like the opposite of sunk cost fallacy, you're actively trying to spend as much as possible for no benefit.If it's just to cover that little release-to-compromise window, then you could argue it was cost-effective, but that's NOT what it's for. It's to control and profiteer off all content.Thats... that's the same thing. They are trying to profit. They put DRM in to profit in the release window. They don't remove it because that's an expense they couldn't be fucked going through. Your point makes no sense. If it is about control alone then all  So tell me... at what point after it's pirated do they turn that stuff off (they don't) Of course they don't. Why would they?

We will do whatever we want with it. Don't like it? Create your own shit. And here we are with neither side backing down. It's not just punishing billions, it's literally punishing the paying customers, and only the paying customers. Arr, me first mate never sets ye \"disallow screenshots\" flag, matey. I almost agree, but that's not the purpose of DRM. It's about putting up little obstacles to keep the sheep in line. Convenience is king, and if it takes more than a few minutes effort to get around an obstacle they'll just take the easier path even if it means paying $17.99. Remember back in the heyday of music piracy, using Napster was a real pain. It often took hours to get a good copy of a song, let alone a whole album, but it was far easier than going to a record store and browsing through CDs. Now the    Hilariously, not once in those same 30 years, have those who pirate not been able to get a perfect copy  I believe the feature was never about stopping pirates.   It is to deter casual copying. They want to make sure the average consumer can't easily make a copy and share it with your neighbor, etc.     Determined people can always find things ripped online and prepared by other pirates,   but they also send lawyers after downloaders too sometimes.

Since videos are a combination of several still frames and an audio track  No.  Videos are a combination of audio track and numerous groups of ordered frames. Only some frames in the video file called keyframes record the whole image, and most frames are only the differences from the last keyframe.    The encoding process is ABSOLUTELY critical. The storage requirements would be absolutely astronomical if the video was not encoded in this way.     Your idea of screenshotting every frame if it were theoretical This is one of many reasons you should never update your Apple OS after the major release the device came with. If you fail or refuse to update you do eventually reach a point where the DRM engine forces you to update before you are able to watch any more DRM-protected video content. How else would they prevent pirates from just rolling back to earlier versions or declining updates  in order to Evade the \"hardware blacklist\" feature of HDCP? Pretty cute idea, but I think no...   My guess would be \"Screenshotting DRM-protected videos\"   was never designed nor intended to be a feature that would be a thing.      Playback of most DRM content types at 4k requires hardware acceleration.     The video is decoded and rendered directly on the GPU so software never sees it.     Same reason Netflix doesn't work over a screensharing session even in Windows. I am not sure why   Microsoft would go through extra efforts  to restore screenshot functionality  f  This, in fact, used to be a viable way to capture video assets when there was no other obvious solution. You'd script a player or an app to advance one frame at a time, grabbing screens, then use something like AfterEffects or DeBabelIzer to turn the stills into a video track, then separately record the audio, analog through the headphone jack if you had to, and lay back the audio onto the video. Of course, this would often fall out of sync due to problems with 29.97\/30 fps, and you'd have trouble with things   Hmmm, doesnt sound like a huge problem really. Sounds exactly like the kind of thing that someone could write a script to do. Chatgpt could probably write the code for you. Chatgpt could probably write the code for you. Last time I asked Chatgpt to help me bypass encryption it refused to help and was an extremely rude and threatening chatbot. I'm afraid that if you told it that \"Write code to bypass digital rights management by playing a video file;  capture the audio,  screenshot each frame, and reassemble them into a new video file\"   ChatGPT would instead  report you to the MPAA By premium Apple laptop for 4k Euros.

Need IT expertise and FOSS demons\/services installments to reclaim play button and stop iCloud ads, like on some cheap-ass discounter Windows trash top. Unacceptable. They've lost me as a customer. And expected the first comment being an explanation of how this works. Accelerated hw decoding happens from buffer to buffer, the destination buffer can be (and usually is) in vRAM. vRAM buffers can be encrypted, it's just a flag at buffer allocation. Those encrypted buffers can't be read out of the GPU without knowledge of the key.

[phoronix.com] It's evil, it's crappy, but it's required by the MAFIA Despite all this DRM, it seems like pirates find it incredibly easy to capture an entire video stream and save it as an unencrypted video file, which then ends up on file download sites, torrent sites and, yep, pirate streaming sites that stream it without DRM. Once it's available as a normal video file, it's then trivial for the end user to run a video player, pause it and screenshot any frame they like on any device they can play video on.

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"The gaming landscape has changed quite a bit over the last decade, and over the years we\u2019ve seen a dramatic shift both within the industry and overarching culture of the business \u2013 the console wars have more or less ended, handheld PC gaming continues to gain more fans, and then there\u2019s Microsoft\u2019s rather quirky pivot towards cloud-based gaming. READ: Nintendo Finally Confirms a Schedule for its Switch 2 Reveal In the thick of it all however, Japanese gaming veteran Nintendo has remained a constant presence within an ever-changing market. In fact, the Nintendo Switch has just turned eight years old as of today, making it one of the longest-supported consoles in Nintendo\u2019s history. It\u2019s also been one of the best-selling systems from the company, and as of February has sold more than 150 million units in its lifetime, inching on the previous record held by the Nintendo DS. The Switch\u2019s arrival back in 2017 was a follow-up to the innovative but ultimately doomed Wii U, with Nintendo promising a unique gaming experience that combines console and portable gaming, the latter of which has been one of the company\u2019s biggest strengths. It\u2019s even proved popular enough to the point that it\u2019s been adopted by devices from other manufacturers, such as the Lenovo Legion Go for example. The Switch was generally well-received during its initial debut thanks to strong launch titles like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and other popular franchises such as Mario and Pokemon helped propel its popularity even further. It should be noted though that the console is far from perfect.  Problematic controls aside, perhaps one of the biggest complaints that the Switch received was its overall hardware and performance especially when compared to rival systems from Sony and Microsoft, both of which excelled in terms of raw power. The thing with Nintendo though is that this was never really in its playbook \u2013 as seen with the NES and the original Gameboy, Nintendo\u2019s main objective has always been to offer customers entertaining gaming experiences despite falling a bit behind the competition, at least when it comes to high-end hardware. Nintendo\u2019s main objective has always been to offer customers entertaining gaming experiences despite falling a bit behind the competition, at least when it comes to high-end hardware. Eight years later, and it\u2019s probably safe to say that this strategy has worked nicely in the Switch\u2019s favor. With three different models available for buyers, the system has now amassed an expansive library of titles from first-party originals to ports and even remasters of older classics, and even with the Switch 2 arriving soon, we\u2019re bound to see a few more years of support for the console in the way of newer games and with system updates.  Having owned all three variations of the Switch myself, I can confidently say that Nintendo\u2019s first-ever hybrid handheld console ranks among my most favourite gaming systems. It\u2019s certainly got that \u201cit factor\u201d that we also saw with the 3DS, which likewise stayed in store shelves for almost a decade after its launch. Sure, it\u2019s old now, but it still shines thanks to a solid library and uniqueness that even after all these years, manages to stay strong.

[+] campus of Eli Lilly and Company on March 17, 2024 in Indianapolis, Indiana. Lilly, a pharmaceutical company, employs more than 12.000 people in Indianapolis and more than 42,000 worldwide. (Photo by Scott Olson\/Getty Images)   Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) recently announced its plans to invest $27 billion in four new U.S. manufacturing plants over the next five years, creating thousands of jobs. This move comes at a time when the pharmaceutical industry is facing potential import tariffs on medications under the Trump administration.  LLY stock has fared well so far this year, up around 20%. At its current levels of $920, LLY looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with LLY stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is extremely high. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of LLY stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Eli Lilly along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. Separately, see \u2013 What\u2019s Happening With XRP\u2019s Price? Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, LLY stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. \u2022 Eli Lilly has a price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 17.8 vs. a figure of 3.1 for the S&P 500   \u2022 Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P\/EBIT) ratio is 48.2 compared to 24.4 for S&P 500   \u2022 And, it has a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 120.8 vs. the benchmark's 24.4 Eli Lilly's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. \u2022 Eli Lilly has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 11.9% over the last 3 years (vs. 9.8% for S&P 500)   \u2022 Its revenues have grown 27.4% from $32 Bil to $41 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. change of 5.6% for S&P 500)   \u2022 Also, its quarterly revenues grew 20.4% to $11 Bil in the most recent quarter from $9.5 Bil a year ago (vs. 7.2% change for S&P 500) Eli Lilly's profit margins are higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. \u2022 Eli Lilly's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $15 Bil, which represents a high Operating Margin of 37.0% (vs. 12.6% for S&P 500)   \u2022 Eli Lilly\u2019s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $6.0 Bil, pointing to a moderate OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 14.8% (vs. 14.4% for S&P 500) Eli Lilly's balance sheet looks strong. \u2022 Eli Lilly's Debt figure was $31 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $828 Bil (as of 2\/28\/2025). This implies a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 4.3% (vs. 19.7% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable]   \u2022 Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $3.4 Bil of the $79 Bil in Total Assets for Eli Lilly. This yields a poor Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 4.7% (vs. 14.1% for S&P 500) LLY stock has seen an impact that was slightly better than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on LLY stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Eli Lilly Stock Go In A Market Crash? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. \u2022 LLY stock fell 17.0% from a high of $374.76 on 4 December 2022 to $311.22 on 28 February 2023, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 13 April 2023   \u2022 Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $960.02 on 2 September 2024 and currently trades at around $920 \u2022 LLY stock fell 16.9% from a high of $143.20 on 17 March 2020 to $119.05 on 23 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 8 April 2020 \u2022 LLY stock fell 53.1% from a high of $58.55 on 9 October 2007 to $27.47 on 5 March 2009, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 26 February 2014  In summary, Eli Lilly's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: \u2022 Growth: Extremely Strong   \u2022 Profitability: Strong   \u2022 Financial Stability: Strong   \u2022 Downturn Resilience: Strong   \u2022 Overall: Very Strong Hence, despite its extremely high valuation, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that LLY is a tricky stock to buy. Not too happy about the volatile nature of LLY stock?

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"A well priced Alienware PC? If you\u2019ve been trying to buy an RTX 5080, you already know it\u2019s nearly impossible to find. Nvidia\u2019s new GPU has been selling out instantly, with standalone cards unavailable or listed at outrageous resale prices. That\u2019s why this deal from Dell is worth a look. The Alienware Aurora R16 gaming PC includes an RTX 5080 for just $2,399.99 right now. $2,399.99 See here Alienware pre-builts have a bit of a reputation, I get it. They've been called overpriced, difficult to upgrade, and a bit pants when it comes to airflow. But Aurora R16 has made some noticeable improvements. It features an Intel Core Ultra 7 265F processor with 20 cores and a 5.3GHz turbo boost, a solid choice for gaming, streaming, and multitasking. 16GB of DDR5 RAM (5200MHz) and 1TB NVMe SSD offer fast load times and decent performance, though 16GB of RAM is a little underwhelming at this price. It can be bumped up to 64GB if you need more memory down the line. RTX 5080 is the real reason to consider this PC. It\u2019s not a massive leap over the RTX 4080, but it does come with DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation, which helps boost frame rates in supported games. If you\u2019re upgrading from an RTX 30-series card or older, you\u2019ll see a big improvement. The main issue is availability. Standalone RTX 5080 cards are either out of stock or going for over $2,000 (RRP is around $1,300), making this one of the few ways to get one without dealing with scalpers. Other prebuilt systems with this GPU are priced above $4,000, so this is one of the better deals right now. Alienware has also stepped up its cooling with a 240mm liquid cooler, which is a welcome improvement. That said, airflow isn\u2019t as optimized as it would be on a custom-built PC with multiple intake fans. The 1,000W 80PLUS Platinum PSU is more than enough, pumping stable power delivery for high-performance gaming. One downside is that Alienware still uses some proprietary parts, which can make upgrading trickier than with a custom build. At $2,399.99, this is one of the best ways to secure an RTX 5080 without getting ripped off. It\u2019s not perfect, but considering the state of the GPU market it\u2019s a solid option. If you\u2019ve been waiting for a high-end prebuilt with the latest hardware at a reasonable price, here it is.

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has projected it would have a cost-profit margin of 545% for its AI models \u2014 provided everyone currently using them would pay.          In a GitHub post on Saturday, DeepSeek said its largely free V3 and R1 models had a daily running cost of $87,072 over a 24-hour period at the end of February, based on leasing Nvidia chips at $2 per hour.                If usage over that period was billed at DeepSeek-R1's pricing, it would generate daily revenue of $562,027, with a \"cost profit margin of 545%,\" the post said.                 Under those parameters, it would imply annual revenue exceeding $200 million.               However, DeepSeek said just a \"subset\" of its services are currently monetized, meaning its theoretical figures would require all users to switch to a paid plan \u2014 something that none of its rivals has achieved.                The assumption that everyone would pay isn't the only part of the post that brings the figure into doubt.               The startup said the cost-profit figure only applies R1 billing pricing and does not factor in the \"significantly lower\" V3 pricing.               Notably, DeepSeek also applies off-peak pricing, which adds a further asterisk to its theoretical financials.                   Day 6 of #OpenSourceWeek: One More Thing \u2013 DeepSeek-V3\/R1 Inference System OverviewOptimized throughput and latency via: Cross-node EP-powered batch scaling Computation-communication overlap Load balancingStatistics of DeepSeek's Online Service: 73.7k\/14.8k               \u2014 DeepSeek (@deepseek_ai) March 1, 2025           During peak daytime hours, its Nvidia H800 chips focus on inference, which is when AI models conduct tasks. During lower-demand nighttime hours, it reallocates those chips to focus on research and training.                Because of this cost-saving mechanism, DeepSeek said it automatically applied nighttime discounts for developers, which would also bring down its actual revenue.                 Despite the disclaimers, it's the first time the Hangzhou-based company has disclosed details about its financials from inference tasks.               It provides fresh insight into DeepSeek more than a month after it launched a powerful AI model at a seemingly lower cost, shocking Silicon Valley and causing a sell-off in tech stocks.                The market rout was partly fueled by the company's claim that it trained its models using less than $6 million worth of Nvidia H800 chips \u2014 a fraction of the spending by other US AI giants like OpenAI.               Since the H800 chips are less powerful than the chips used by many tech giants, DeepSeek's success raised further questions about the necessity of billion-dollar AI infrastructure expenditures.               However, DeepSeek's cost claims have drawn scrutiny from tech giants, researchers, and regulatory authorities.               Last month, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis called the buzz around DeepSeek's low-cost model \"exaggerated.\" He said that DeepSeek's claim of training its AI model for just $5.6 million likely only accounts for the final training phase, overlooking the broader investment in development and infrastructure.

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"Essay The chances are you\u2019ve heard of Google Chrome. It\u2019s currently the biggest browser in the world, but that comes with issues. Issues that I think need addressing. However, it\u2019s crucial to examine how we reached this stage to form comprehensive opinions. Let\u2019s start at the start with the birth of the first browser. In 1990, WorldWideWeb (later known as Nexus) was released by Tim Berners-Lee for the NeXTSTEP operating system exclusively. This was the first web browser and the sole way to see the web. In 1992, the first stable version of the Line Mode Browser was released, with support for the more widely used X Window System. Following that were many more browsers, such as Erwise and ViolaWWW, and later Cello and Lynx, but there was one that really stood out. Releasing in 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications\u2019 Mosaic came with big changes and huge influence. Mosaic was a marked shift. It was the first browser to display images in line with the rest of the content and was notably easier to set up. As with all things in this early stage of the web, it didn\u2019t stay stagnant for long. Towards the end of 1994, Mosaic began losing its dominance to a new player. Netscape. Inspired by the success of Mosaic, Netscape very quickly made a name for itself in the browser arena. It introduced showing content as it downloaded, which made it preferable for the average dial-up user who previously had to wait for the entire page to load before it would display. Its flagship browser, Netscape Navigator, was one of the first to support JavaScript. Around this time, Opera emerged. It entered the market with its own proprietary layout engine, titled Elektra. Microsoft took notice of Netscape\u2019s success and saw the internet as a profitable market. They created the now infamous Internet Explorer. Initially considered inferior by many, Explorer began to slowly claw away some market share for itself, gradually chipping away at Navigator and its competitors. Netscape Navigator came in two editions: Gold and Standard. With the release of version 4, the Gold Edition (which was notable for having many extra functions that negatively impacted stability) was rebranded to Netscape Communicator. This name change was a shot in the foot that affected their brand recognition and, bundled with performance slower than Microsoft\u2019s new Internet Explorer 5, spelt their demise. By the time the new millennium rolled around, many new browsers had launched (such as KDE\u2019s Konqueror), Netscape was on its deathbed, and Explorer was thriving, with a peak market share of 95%. Google also began showing some interest in the browser market with the release of Google Toolbar for Internet Explorer. It wasn\u2019t all sunshine and rainbows for Microsoft\u2019s browser, though. Microsoft was accused of leveraging its dominant position in the market to unfairly promote Internet Explorer over other browsers to stifle competition. This came to a head in 2001 with the ominous-sounding United States of America vs Microsoft Corporation. It concluded with Microsoft drafting a settlement proposal that permitted PC manufacturers to use non-Microsoft software. Shortly after this lawsuit, in 2003, Apple released their own browser, Safari, which quickly gained popularity on their Macs, although they initially failed to release it elsewhere. Safari used the WebKit engine, a fork of the KHTML and KJS libraries from KDE\u2019s browser, Konqueror. Also in 2003, Opera 7 released with a large rewrite and a new layout engine, titled Presto. By the time 2004 rolled around, a product concocted by a small group formed by Netscape in 1998 had materialised. The product became Firefox, and the group became the Mozilla Foundation. The same year, rumours began swirling that Google was building a browser of its own. Firefox was free, leaving little barrier to entry, and people were more than interested in leaving Internet Explorer, which had gained a reputation for poor security and questionable support for web standards. Firefox also used a unique rendering engine called Gecko and was open source. Upon release, Firefox immediately challenged Explorer\u2019s dominance. Within a mere nine months, the browser had amassed in excess of 60 million downloads. It continued to grow until its peak in 2009, with just over 30% market share. Apple realised that they were limiting themselves by only including their browser on their own OS. As such, they released a version for Microsoft Windows. Unfortunately, this couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time, as the next year Google finally entered the browser market and released Chrome. Despite initial reluctance from Google CEO Eric Schmidt to enter the browser wars, he eventually relented, and in 2008, Google Chrome released. Using components from Firefox and Apple\u2019s WebKit, it was built upon Chromium, an open-source base also developed by Google. The release was marked with a short comic by Scott McCloud. It didn\u2019t see success as instant as Firefox, but instead slowly crept up, to the point that by 2012 it was beating all other major browsers. From that point on, it only continued to grow and has taken complete dominance. In 2012, Safari was discontinued for Windows, where its market share had been decimated. However, it\u2019s continued to remain a popular choice on Apple operating systems. The following year, Opera announced its intention to switch from Presto to WebKit, although around the same time, Google announced they would be forking WebKit, to which they were already the largest contributor, to create Blink. Following this, Opera revised their plans and moved to Blink. With 2015 came Microsoft\u2019s attempt to reaffirm their place in the browser market. They unveiled Edge, a new browser built from the ground up with their own engines \u2013 the proprietary EdgeHTML browser engine and open-source JavaScript engine Chakra. Following this unveiling, they announced plans to sunset Internet Explorer and subsequently adopted Edge as the new default browser in Windows. Unfortunately for Microsoft, Edge wasn\u2019t much liked upon release. While praised for performance, it was slandered for its lack of features and poor design choices, among other issues. Microsoft saw this and announced in 2018 that it would rebuild Edge as a Chromium-based browser. This move was completed in 2020 and was seen much more favourably. This left the web with three major engines: Google\u2019s Blink, Mozilla\u2019s Gecko, and Apple\u2019s WebKit. Almost every browser currently in existence relies on one of these three engines. Apple\u2019s WebKit sees significant use on its own devices. Safari is the browser of choice for most macOS users, as it\u2019s preinstalled. WebKit also sees unanimous use on both iOS and iPadOS, where all browsers are relegated to merely a front for it. It also sees a degree of use in embedded applications thanks to its performant nature and in some other browsers. Mozilla\u2019s Gecko sees very minimal use outside of Firefox. It is used by a few Firefox forks, but very little beyond that. Google\u2019s Blink sees the most use by far. This is what this article has been building up to and where the issues lie. Almost everything uses Blink. Microsoft Edge? Blink. Opera? Blink. Opera GX? Blink. Vivaldi? Blink. Brave? Blink. Samsung Internet? Blink. UC? Blink. Amazon Silk? Blink. Arc? Blink. Yandex? Blink.  If you\u2019re wondering, the browser you\u2019re reading this article in isn\u2019t Chromium-based.  But it goes beyond that. It\u2019s not only the engine used by most of the most popular browsers; it\u2019s also the engine that powers Electron. Thus, the desktop applications for Discord, VS Code, Figma, Obsidian, Signal, Slack, etc, are all using Blink. It is also the engine used by the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF), which is used by a further huge number of applications, including behemoths such as Steam, Spotify, GOG Galaxy, and a decent portion of Adobe\u2019s offerings. Android\u2019s System WebView, which allows developers to embed web content in native Android applications, is also based on Chromium, which means it is integrated throughout Android as well. All these integrations also place it in car infotainment systems and smart televisions. It\u2019s everywhere! There is no choice in the browser market. It\u2019s all just Blink, and Blink is Google. This means that Google has near-complete and absolute control over the browser market. Bundle this with the most popular search engine, and they have near-complete control over the web. This simply isn\u2019t acceptable. The web, at its core, is open. That is what was defined when it was created, and that is how it must stay. Almost everyone on this planet relies on the web in some way or another, and the idea that a single entity can control the entire thing is preposterous. If you\u2019ve been reading attentively, you may remember the comic I mentioned that was released alongside Chrome. Well, in 2022, a parody released with a few changes. It outlines a few of the things that Google is doing within Chrome that have far-reaching implications. Beyond all the spying, the comic touches on something of particular interest: the advent of Manifest v3 and its implications. Most browsers have support for the WebExtensions API, which is a system for developing extensions that can be used across browsers. These extensions require a file called manifest.json that defines metadata, behaviour, and an assortment of other information. Naturally, this specification has evolved over time. The latest iteration is Manifest v3. It attempts to address issues regarding privacy, security, and performance. Namely, it embraces service workers, prevents remotely hosted code, and depreciates the webRequest API. This is, in general, a good thing. Extensions are a huge attack vector with potential for malicious use, and the changes introduced by Manifest v3 act to lessen their potential impact. Unfortunately, these changes also restrict the capabilities of extensions, especially content blockers. Blocking adverts, trackers, and the likes isn\u2019t just a nice-to-have anymore \u2013 it\u2019s near on required for safe web browsing. Even the United States\u2019 FBI recommends you use an ad blocker. Content blockers are severely restricted in functionality under Manifest v3 as a result of the depreciation of the webRequest API, which is used to block content prior to it loading. uBlock Origin, one of the most popular content blockers around, released a \u2018lite\u2019 version with lesser functionality as a result of these changes, and many other extensions, mainly those that boost privacy and reduce data collection, are hit the hardest. Google is a company that makes the bulk of its revenue through advertising and data collection. Perhaps it\u2019s conspiracy to think that they\u2019re making these changes to bolster their income, but it certainly isn\u2019t hurting it. This is a change that is being pushed by Google and a change that Google has the most to gain from. Manifest v3 is also being adopted by Firefox to ensure interoperability, though they don\u2019t intend to phase out v2 for the foreseeable future. Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) is another excellent example of the problems with Google having power. AMP is a framework that aims to improve the performance of web content, particularly on mobile. It improves speed by restricting certain elements and optimising content delivery. While these are great intentions, they\u2019ve seen much good criticism. One large criticism is that it gives Google a huge amount of control over the way content is displayed on the web, which influences how things are built and monetised. It also has impacts on privacy and security. Another criticism is that Google prioritises AMP links above others, potentially impacting the visibility of non-AMP content. Google\u2019s \u201cTop Stories\u201d section, which is located above the main search results, exclusively displayed AMP links. This more or less forced publishers into using AMP if they wanted any exposure. They only removed the AMP requirement in 2021 after facing legal threats. AMP is just another way that Google has shown that they are not content with simply existing within the web but instead wish to control it. If you\u2019d like to read more about AMP and its impact, then I\u2019d suggest this Reddit post from the creator of the Amputator bot. In April of 2023, some Google engineers created a GitHub repository explaining the details of a proposal for Web Environment Integrity (WEI). Despite huge negative feedback, code started being implemented into Chromium in preparation for implementation. Fortunately, the proposal was abandoned in November, and what had been implemented was removed, although a replacement for Android WebViews titled \u201cAndroid WebView Media Integrity API\u201d was swiftly proposed and looks to enter testing in early 2024. You may be wondering exactly what it is. WEI is more or less a way to verify that a site is \u2018genuine\u2019. It can be best described as Digital Rights Management (DRM) for the web and, wouldn\u2019t you know, could\u2019ve also impacted ad blockers if they were found to be altering the web environment\u2019s integrity. Perhaps the impact of WEI most relevant to this article is the fact that browsers, especially those out of the mainstream or that offer unique or uncommon features, might have found themselves considered \u2018untrusted\u2019 and therefore severely limited. I could continue with further examples, but I think the point is made, and I expect you\u2019ve gathered the picture. The web is dominated by Chrome, and something needs to be done about it. As Bryce Wray illustrates in his article \u201cFirefox on the Brink?\u201d the US Web Design System mandates official support for browsers exceeding 2% usage on US government-run websites. A similar requirement is set by the British government. As he suggests, it may be a lot sooner than we expect that Firefox loses consideration for compatibility during development. I very much recommend reading his article for discussion on the topic. You\u2019re likely wondering what you can do. The answer is simple: support healthy competition and use a browser based on something other than Chromium. The best bet would be using Firefox or something based on it. Firefox is free, open-source, available on most platforms, and Mozilla has largely shown a commitment to both the user and the web (though not without their stumbles). If you\u2019re coming from one of the more flashy \u2018cutting edge\u2019 Chromium browsers like Arc or Opera GX, then Zen will provide a very similar experience. If you\u2019re looking for something with privacy in mind like Brave or the DuckDuckGo browser, then you can try LibreWolf or Mullvad Browser. If you require anonymity or need to avoid censorship, then you might consider the Tor Browser. Otherwise, you can also check out Waterfox, IceCat, Pale Moon, Floorp, Mercury, and all the other assorted forks that exist. If WebKit is more your style, then Kagi\u2019s Orion Browser is looking promising and has native extension support. You can also check out GNOME Web (Epiphany). As the web\u2019s future depends on diversity in browser engines, you might also consider supporting the development and growth of projects that aren\u2019t built on the big three existing engines: Servo is a web rendering engine started by Mozilla back in 2012 that is now handled by the Linux Foundation. It\u2019s pretty far along in development and is beginning to see real-world deployment, such as use in embedded applications. Ladybird is a very ambitious project intending to build out a full web browser complete with its own rendering and JavaScript engines. Dillo is a very small and fast little browser with its own little engine and no scripting support. It doesn\u2019t aim for a complete web experience but excels as a quick, lightweight one. \u00a9 Declan Chidlow. All rights reserved.","label":0}

Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ: URBN), a lifestyle retailer targeting young adults and teenagers, closed the year with an outstanding fourth-quarter performance, achieving record sales of $1.6 billion that exceeded expectations with a 10% year-over-year (y-o-y) increase. The company\u2019s earnings per share also surpassed projections, coming in at $1.04 (up 51% y-o-y) compared to consensus estimates of $0.94. In addition, URBN\u2019s gross margin expanded by 300 basis points to 32.3% in Q4, driven by improved initial merchandise margins and the effective execution of cross-functional brand initiatives across its three segments \u2013 Retail, Wholesale, and Nuuly. Furthermore, the retailer\u2019s smaller brands, FP Movement and Nuuly, are fueling growth, with Nuuly recording a 50% surge in subscribers during the quarter. Notably, the company\u2019s stock has risen 60% since the beginning of 2024, compared to a 23% increase in the S&P 500 index. In contrast, URBN\u2019s peer American Eagle Outfitters(NYSE: AEO) saw its stock decline by 36% over the same period. Separately, Should You Buy AVGO Stock After A 7% Fall? Urban Outfitters has set forth its strategic objectives for fiscal 2026, aiming for mid-single-digit sales growth and a 50-100 basis point improvement in gross margins. Key initiatives include opening 58 new stores, closing 19 underperforming locations, and executing a $240 million capital expenditure program. Moreover, the company plans to expand its Nuuly subscription service with a revenue target of $500 million. Additionally, if you prefer an investment with less volatility than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and recorded returns of over 91% since inception. Overall, URBN\u2019s current price of $57 aligns with Trefis\u2019 valuation for Urban Outfitters\u2019 Valuation. This valuation is based on an expected EPS of $4.55 and a 12.7x P\/E multiple for fiscal year 2026. We project URBN revenues to reach $5.9 billion in fiscal year 2026, marking a 7% year-over-year increase. Urban Outfitters\u2019 fourth-quarter results concealed underlying challenges, with the flagship brand experiencing its eleventh consecutive quarter of negative growth. Notably, while Free People and Anthropologie posted comparable retail sales growth of 8% and 8.3%, respectively, Urban Outfitters\u2019 comparable sales declined by 3.5%. This trend mirrors the previous quarter (Q3), during which Free People and Anthropologie recorded growth of 5.3% and 5.8%, respectively, while Urban Outfitters\u2019 sales dropped by 8.9%. Nonetheless, the Urban Outfitters brand did show some quarter-over-quarter improvement. URBN stock's performance over the past four years has been inconsistent, with annual returns displaying considerably more volatility than the S&P 500. The stock achieved returns of 15% in 2021, -19% in 2022, 50% in 2023, and 54% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, is notably less volatile and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why is that?Overall, the HQ Portfolio stocks delivered better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, as reflected in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"Nvidia shares fell Monday, diving further into correction territory despite reporting stronger-than-expected headline earnings last Wednesday, as the artificial intelligence leader headlines broader stock market losses as investors reassess risks tied largely to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. Traders work on the New York Stock Exchange floor Monday. Nvidia stock fell 8.7% to about $114 per share, closing at its lowest share price since mid September. Catalyzing the Monday drop was a report from The Wall Street Journal on Chinese buyers skirting U.S. export controls on Nvidia\u2019s highly sought after AI chip technology, with Trump\u2019s afternoon vow to implement 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports accelerating an across-the-board selloff Monday. Nvidia led broader losses Monday, as the benchmark S&P 500 fell 1.8% and the tech-concentrated Nasdaq dropped 2.6%, with most of the losses trailing Trump\u2019s afternoon announcement that the tariffs will take effect Tuesday. The S&P closed Monday at its lowest level since Jan. 14, the Nasdaq notched its lowest close since Nov. 4 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which declined 1.5% (640 points) Monday, sank to its lowest price since Jan. 16. The S&P and Nasdaq are down 4.8% and 8.5% from their respective all-time closing highs set Feb. 19. Monday was the S&P\u2019s biggest percentage loss of 2025. The bellwether S&P has given up almost all of its post-election gains, closing just 1.2% above where it stood Election Day, excluding dividends. The index is down 2.5% from Trump\u2019s second inauguration. More than $600 billion. That\u2019s how much market capitalization Nvidia has lost since Feb. 19. Nvidia lost its mantle as the world\u2019s second most valuable public company Monday, slipping behind Microsoft. Nvidia is worth about $800 billion less than Apple, which has a market capitalization of $3.6 trillion. Nvidia was worth more than Apple as recently as January. Nvidia cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s net worth fell by $10 billion to $99 billion Monday, according to our estimates. Huang, who is the 16th-richest person in the world, has gotten about $24 billion poorer since Feb. 20, when he was the 11th-wealthiest person. Shares of Nvidia have declined 13% since last Wednesday\u2019s earnings report and 18% since Feb. 19, before the U.S. stock market began to deflate. The poster child of 2023\u2019s and 2024\u2019s bull market, Nvidia has become the face of the recent pullback as Wall Street\u2019s risk appetite weakens. Nvidia exceeded consensus estimates for fourth-quarter profit and revenue and guided for higher sales during the current quarter than analysts expected. But the report left investors \u201ca couple things to pick at,\u201d noted UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri, including weaker gross profit margins. And pick they did, as Nvidia stock declined 8.5% in the first trading session following earnings. Nvidia is the undisputed market leader in designing the semiconductor technology powering the generative AI revolution, but it received a significant ding in the eyes of investors in January as the release of the efficient DeepSeek AI model from China stoked fears about softer demand for Nvidia\u2019s expensive technology.

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"ByMatthew F. Erskine, JD  ByMatthew F. Erskine, JD , Contributor.  Tariffs - just ahead Recently, Michael Sonnenfeldt \u2014 the founder of TIGER 21, a peer network of ultra-high-net-worth investors \u2014 discussed with Crain Currency how members of his organization are positioning their portfolios in response to tariffs and market volatility. With new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, an increasingly protectionist trade environment, and market volatility shaking investor confidence, many industries are bracing for impact. He highlights the importance of diversification, assesses sector-specific risks, and discusses the historically low cash reserves among wealthy investors, which could signal either confidence or market overvaluation. The discussion on the carried interest tax loophole adds a policy dimension to investment considerations. While fine art and collectibles have long been considered alternative assets, these economic shifts could pose fresh challenges for artists, collectors, and dealers alike. For those who buy, sell, or invest in art, understanding how these macroeconomic trends might shape the market is essential. From rising costs and regulatory hurdles to shifts in investment behavior, the art market is at an inflection point. But with the right strategy, it\u2019s possible to navigate these turbulent waters and even find opportunities amid the uncertainty. At first glance, tariffs on steel and aluminum might not seem like they would impact the art world. After all, paintings and sculptures aren\u2019t exactly raw industrial materials. But dig a little deeper, and the ripple effects become clear. For artists who rely on imported materials\u2014such as rare pigments, high-quality canvases, or sculpting stone or metals\u2014costs could rise, increasing the price of production. Galleries and auction houses that import artwork from overseas may see higher tariffs on art and antiques, making international acquisitions more expensive. Even logistics costs for transporting art could be affected by broader trade restrictions, impacting collectors who buy and sell globally. Currency fluctuations also play a role. If tariffs and market instability weaken the U.S. dollar, foreign buyers may find American art more attractive, boosting sales for domestic artists. On the flip side, a stronger dollar would make imported artwork more expensive, potentially dampening enthusiasm for European or Asian art among U.S. collectors. Sonnenfeldt\u2019s analysis reveals an interesting trend: Wealthy investors are doubling down on traditional long-term assets like real estate and private equity, with a historically low allocation to cash\u2014a level not seen since 2007, just before the financial crisis. This could be interpreted in two ways. On the one hand, it signals confidence in the economy, suggesting that investors are willing to take risks. On the other, it could be a warning sign\u2014historically, overconfidence has preceded major market corrections. For the art world, this matters. While fine art has long been a favored alternative asset, it competes for capital with other investments like real estate, private equity, and stocks. If wealthy investors are allocating more to traditional assets and less to collectibles, speculative art investments may see a slowdown. This means that emerging artists and contemporary art markets\u2014which thrive on speculative buying\u2014could face headwinds. Conversely, established artists and blue-chip collectibles may remain attractive as a hedge against inflation. With international transactions becoming more complex, artists and dealers should focus on strengthening domestic and regional markets. Exploring digital platforms such as NFTs, online galleries, and fractional art ownership models can also help expand reach beyond traditional collectors, but are still untested markets for any downturn. For artists and galleries, sourcing materials locally can help avoid tariff-related price increases. Dealers should negotiate better shipping and insurance terms and explore bonded warehouses or freeports to defer import taxes until a sale is made. Since many ultra-wealthy investors are focusing on real estate and equities, dealers and art advisors should position fine art as a stable long-term investment. Highlighting historical appreciation trends and drawing comparisons to other tangible assets can attract capital that might otherwise go to real estate or private equity. Additionally, artwork can be seen as an enhancement for real estate investments when it is placed on display. New tariffs, taxation policies, and import\/export restrictions could reshape art transactions. Collectors and dealers should work closely with customs brokers and legal advisors to ensure compliance and mitigate unforeseen costs. One often-overlooked consequence of economic shifts is their impact on estate and succession planning for artists and collectors. As artwork appreciates over time, proper planning becomes essential to preserve both artistic legacies and financial assets. For collectors, new tax policies or estate tax reforms could significantly impact how art is passed down to heirs. Without proper structuring, heirs may face massive tax liabilities, forcing them to sell pieces they might have otherwise kept in the family. Strategies such as trusts, estate freezes, or fractional gifting can help mitigate estate tax burdens while ensuring a smooth transition of ownership. For artists, estate planning is crucial both to minimize current income tax from the sale of self-created artwork and estate tax on the transfer of artwork, all while maintaining control over their work posthumously. Estate plans must have clear instructions, how to resolve disputes over copyrights, reproduction rights, and ownership to avoid lengthy legal battles\u2014as seen in the estates of artists like Picasso and Basquiat. Setting up artist-endowed foundations, licensing agreements, and trusts can safeguard an artist\u2019s work and ensure their legacy is managed according to their wishes. While tariffs and economic volatility introduce new challenges, they also present opportunities for those willing to adapt. A downturn in the value of artwork may be an opportunity to transfer artwork or collectibles at a significant discount to its long-term value. The art market has weathered recessions, booms, and financial crises before \u2014 most recently during the Great Recession of 2008\u2014and it will again. By staying informed, diversifying strategies, and planning, artists, collectors, and dealers can position themselves for success in this evolving landscape. Whether through embracing digital transformation, strengthening local networks, or proactive planning, those in the art world have an opportunity not just to survive but to thrive in the face of change. After all, history has shown that in times of uncertainty, art endures.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  From long lines outside Costco to sticker shock in supermarkets, many shoppers in the US have seen the effects of rising egg prices in stores \u2014 and their wallets.          Between December and January, egg prices rose by a whopping 15.2%, the largest month-over-month increase since June 2015. The average price for a dozen eggs is now $4.95, though many shoppers have reported paying far more.               To be honest, though, I didn't even realize prices had gone up because I've never purchased a carton of eggs in my life.                However, my egg-free existence was never by choice, as I was diagnosed with life-threatening allergies to dairy and eggs when I was around 9 months old.               Although millions of Americans are now in a panic over the price of eggs, many people like me have been living without them for decades \u2014 and it's not as difficult as you may think, especially in 2025.               As a child of the '90s, I found that allergy awareness simply wasn't as prevalent then as it is now.               I frequently had to explain to adults that I couldn't eat a bite out of the snacks they were offering me at day care or summer camp, even after my parents thoroughly explained my allergy to them.       Egg-free options were rare. I could eat snacks like Teddy Grahams and Oreos, but most pastries, bread, and pasta were off-limits.               At the time, there were no crowdsourced Reddit threads I could reference for suggestions for egg substitutes, and plant-based eggs wouldn't be widely available for another few decades.               Eager to ensure I didn't feel left out at birthday parties, my mom once tracked down an egg substitute \u2014 Ener-G Egg Replacer. The powder, a mix of starches and leavening agents, could replace egg whites or egg yolks in baking. She'd find a Duncan Hines cake mix and substitute milk with soy and the eggs with egg replacer.               Luckily, her \"rare\" find back then is fairly common and accessible today.               In recent years, my reality has shifted in a way I never would have imagined in childhood. I haven't outgrown my allergies, but the public has grown more aware of how to accommodate people like me.               Although my mom had trouble finding egg-free alternatives in the '90s, the options today are abundant, thanks in part to the rise in vegan and plant-based diets.               I still remember how emotional I felt last year when I found a vegan bakery in Paris with fresh croissants, pain au chocolat, macrons, and other treats. At last, I could finally order whatever I wanted.               Ordering delicious meals and desserts at restaurants, once a far-off dream, has now become a possibility for me as well. When I was a kid, I was often stuck with bland chicken and veggies when we'd go out to eat.               But recently, I was able to participate in a dessert-only fine-dining experience at Nicosi in San Antonio, and a full meal at Mixtli, a Michelin-starred restaurant.               Even better, egg substitutes feel way easier to research and access at grocery stores, and there are numerous egg replacers on the market.                It's also easy to find egg-free baking recipes online that use substitutes like unsweetened applesauce, bananas, flaxseed, and even aquafaba (the liquid left over from cooked chickpeas).               When I tell people about my allergies (or jokingly ask them what an egg tastes like), they often look at me with pity.                Although I'd love to know the joy of a fresh omelet or what a certain pastry tastes like, an egg-free life isn't nearly as difficult as people often assume.               Plus, on the bright side, I don't have to experience the pain of adding a $7 carton of eggs to my shopping cart.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

The 566-piece recreation of Moana's rooster companion is already on backorder at the Lego Store, but it's still in stock at Amazon. By      Steven Petite    and      Jon Bitner    on March 3, 2025 at 2:36PM PST  Moana 2 Heihei Lego Figure (566 Pieces)   $40 | Released March 1    Lego's series of Moana 2 playsets has expanded with arguably the most exciting building set in the lineup. For $40, Disney fans can build a 10.5-inch model of Heihei, Moana's adorable companion from the films. As you'll see below, Heihei's brick-built form has retained the bewildered expression he is known for. Lego's Heihei building set hit store shelves on March 1; it's the third Moana 2 Lego set released this year.  We've rounded up all of the Moana 2 Lego sets below. If you're interested in adding the new Disney film to your collection, check out our Moana 2 Blu-ray preorder guide. The sequel releases on 4K and standard Blu-ray on March 18, and the Limited Edition Steelbook is currently discounted at Amazon and Walmart.   When fully built, you can move Heihei's head, wings, and tail feathers to create different poses. Heihei can stand on his own for playtime, or you can display Moana's loyal buddy on the buildable stand featuring flowers and a display plate. When connected to the stand, this 566-piece Heihei figure is roughly 10.5 inches tall. As of March 3, Heihei is the No. 1 best-selling new Lego set on Amazon. It's already on backorder at the Lego Store and won't ship for 60 days, so it wouldn't be surprising to see Amazon and Target run out of stock. Moana's Adventure Canoe is essentially the updated version of the existing Wayfinding Boat. A larger set with 529 pieces, the boat is modeled after its appearance in Moana 2 and is crewed by mini-doll figures of Moana and two of the new supporting characters in the sequel: Loto and Moni. Pua the pig is also included, and he also gets his own little house. The boat's deck can be removed, so the mini-dolls can rest or play in the room below. Moana's Island Fun is the smallest playset of the bunch, but it's also the only one that includes figures of Moana and her little sister Simea. These are Lego micro-dolls, which are closer to minifigure size than mini-dolls. This 175-piece playset builds two shelters, a waterfall slide, a small sailboat, and comes with a few surprises. Pua the pig is once again included, because he never wants to be left out of the fun. Moana's Flowerpot looks like it's part of the Lego Botanical Collection--but open up the woven-inspired flowerpot, and inside you\u2019ll find two detailed rooms. It comes with a Moana mini-doll, Pua the pig Lego figure, and numerous removable accessories, including a sailboat and fruit chest. This is a fairly intricate build at over 600 pieces, and the flowerpot stands over 8 inches tall. Moana's Flowerpot is exclusive to Target and the Lego Store  Moana 2 Limited Edition Steelbook on 4K Blu-ray   $45 (was $66) | Releases March 18   Moana 2 on Blu-ray   $28 (was $41) | Releases March 18    More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  When BrianNiccol stepped into the top job at Starbucks in September, he had a game plan to turn things around.          \"We're refocusing on what has always set Starbucks apart \u2014 a welcoming coffeehouse where people gather, and where we serve the finest coffee, handcrafted by our skilled baristas,\" Niccol wrote in an open letter at the time. He dubbed it the \"Back to Starbucks\" plan.               The brand was facing various challenges, including long wait times, flaws in the customer experience, and issues with its mobile ordering system. As Niccol saw it, mobile ordering had chipped away at the brand's soul.               Starbucks' global comparable sales slid by 7% in the fourth quarter of 2024 compared to the same period a year before. Its performance was slightly better in the first quarter of 2025, when global comparable sales decreased by 4% year-on-year.               \"It was trying to command a premium price for an experience that had rapidly deteriorated to being sub-premium, and hence, customers fled,\" Dipanjan Chatterjee, avice president at the New York-based market research company Forrester, told Business Insider.               Six months into the job, retail and marketing experts say Niccol is getting a lot right.               Jeffrey Towson, the founder of theUS and China-based retail consultancy TechMoat Consulting, said Niccol is \"revamping the entire customer journey,\" which is the \"right strategy.\"               He said Starbucks already has one big advantage \u2014 its retail footprint \u2014 but now, it needs to \"revitalize the customer experience and its reputation.\"               \"Real estate trumps brand in retail coffee. Nobody walks an extra two blocks to go to a Tim Horton's versus a Starbucks. They go to the closest one,\" he said.               Niccol is trying to rebrand Starbucks as a cozy local coffeehouse where people can hang out.               He hasbrought back ceramic mugs in store for hot drinks, which he said would improve the caf experience, and re-introduced self-serve condiment bars.               He's asking baristas to personalize the experience by writing notes to their customers on the cups. Customers are being given refills of brewed coffee.               To reduce customer wait times, Niccol has eliminated 30% of its menu offerings and introduced a new mobile ordering system.His goal is to cutwait times to four minutes or less.               Chatterjee told BI that due to its size, Starbuckswill likely not be able to get to a point where every store feels unique and local. But it's making the right move by trying to adopt elements from small coffee shops, Chatterjee said.               \"Lifting elements of the coffee house experience and weaving them into the Starbucks journey, like the ceramic mugs and the doodling, does enough to reduce the sterility of a chain store,\" he said.               Niccol has also made staffing changes. On Monday, the company announced it would be laying off 1,100 employees. In an open letter, Niccol wrote that Starbucks is \"simplifying our structure, removing layers and duplication and creating smaller, more nimble teams.\"               A Starbucks representative told BI that the brand is testing changes to its staffing, processes, and new mobile ordering algorithm to improve its wait times.               The representative added that the chain would add more seating to its cafs to improve the in-store experience and start introducing shelves and risers to separate the caf and mobile ordering sections.               Hal Hershfield, a professor of marketing, behavioral decision-making, and psychology at UCLA, said the success of Niccol's plan willhinge on how well it's executed.               \"Ithas to be more than just a marketing gimmick, and something that gets executed at a deeper level,\" he said.               Starbucks' attempts to emulate the feel of a neighborhood coffeehouse will work \"only if it can actually foster more of a sense of belonging,\" Hershfield added.               Mrio Braz de Matos, the cofounder of the Singapore-based branding consultancy agency Flying Fish Lab, said Niccol's changes would require \"consistent execution across Starbucks' vast network of stores in the US,\" so employee training will be critical.               Starbucks faces broader challenges, like competition from local coffee chains and evolving consumer preferences, which may limit its ability to attract new customers, he said.               In global markets like China, Starbucks faces \"stiff competition\" from competitors like Luckin Coffee, he said.               \"Additionally, the brand's ubiquity in markets like the US means it has fewer untapped customer segments to target,\" he added.               The remaking of the Starbucks brand will take time, Chatterjee said \u2014 and as the brand works to build up more of a caf vibe, it can't afford to lose the speed and efficiency that some customers desire.               \"Sometimes, you want to linger and soak in the atmosphere, and other times, you need to grab and go,\" he said. \"Starbucks needs to win both those occasions.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

Low p\/e stocks Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve noticed that AI-related stocks like Arista Networks, Nvidia, Service Now, C3.AI and others have been selling off lately, sometimes in dramatic fashion. You\u2019ve considered the amount of intense hype surrounding artificial intelligence claims and you\u2019ve decided to at least diversify out of the sector. For something completely different, some investors have been picking up value stocks rather than fantasizing about the possibilities of Silicon Valley\u2019s dream world. Names with low price-earnings ratios don\u2019t always make the front page but a few possess no (or almost no) debt, a quality factor of the old school. And some pay dividends, too. These four seem to possess value stock qualities and may be candidates for further research. Cal Maine Foods (NYSE: CALM) Cal-Maine weekly price chart, 3 3 25. The stock peaked at near $115 in January 2025 and now goes for $89, a drop of 22% in about two months. Note that the 50-week moving average crossed above the 200-week moving average in June 2022 and has remained above it since then. Both moving averages continue to trend upward although the 50-week looks to be slowing. The price-earnings ratio is 7.03 which compares favorably (in terms of valuation) to the p\/e of the S&P 500 now at 37.53. Cal-Maine, with a market cap of $4.43 billion, is a member of the Russell 2000 ETF. The Mississippi-based food products company has no debt, long-term or otherwise. The short float is 11.50%, which is on the high side: a factor that could lead to a short-covering rally of some strength. Cathay General Bancorp (NASD: CATY) Cathay Bancorp weekly price chart, 3 3 25. The stock peaked in late November 2024 and has backed off that high but remains well above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. You can see on this chart how the 50-day has stayed above the 200-day for the entire period shown. There are no guarantees that this will continue, of course, but it\u2019s a solid pattern.

This is the final look at local markets in January.  The big story for January was that existing home sales increased year-over-year (YoY) for the fourth consecutive month following year-over-year declines every month since July 2021. However, sales in January, at 4.08 million on a seasonally adjusted annual rate basis (SAAR) were down from December and still historically low. Sales averaged almost 5.5 million SAAR in the January 2017-2020 period. So, sales were still about 25% below pre-pandemic levels. ... Here is a look at months-of-supply using NSA sales.

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"ByRobert Daugherty  ByRobert Daugherty , Contributor.  In the shadow of recent White House tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, coupled with the new administration's aggressive tariff policies, global investors are reassessing their portfolios. As U.S. equity markets experience a notable rotation from growth to value, Europe emerges as a compelling destination for value-oriented investors seeking both stability and opportunity. The European market has long been overlooked by international investors focused on high-flying American tech stocks. However, as growth stocks lose momentum in the face of economic uncertainty, Europe's value-rich landscape offers a refreshing alternative. European equities currently trade at significant discounts compared to their U.S. counterparts, with price-to-earnings ratios approximately 30% lower on average. This valuation gap isn't merely a reflection of slower growth\u2014it represents a potential opportunity for investors willing to look beyond short-term market narratives. European companies tend to offer higher dividend yields, stronger balance sheets, and more conservative accounting practices than many of their American peers, creating a solid foundation for value investment strategies. As diplomatic efforts intensify to find a resolution to the conflict in Ukraine, Europe stands poised to benefit from the inevitable reconstruction efforts. Germany and France, as the economic powerhouses of the European Union, are particularly well-positioned to lead this process. German engineering firms, with their expertise in infrastructure and energy systems, will likely play a crucial role in rebuilding Ukraine's damaged cities and industrial capacity. French companies, meanwhile, bring strengths in construction, transportation, and urban planning that will be essential for comprehensive reconstruction. The European Commission has already signaled its commitment to supporting Ukraine's recovery with substantial financial packages, creating a potential multi-year tailwind for European businesses engaged in everything from construction to telecommunications. Among the most compelling investment opportunities in Europe today is BNP Paribas, France's largest bank and a global financial powerhouse. Trading at a price-to-book ratio significantly below its historical average, BNP Paribas offers exposure to both European economic recovery and international banking operations. The bank has demonstrated remarkable resilience through various economic cycles and continues to maintain strong capital ratios despite market volatility. Beyond banking, Siemens AG represents another undervalued European giant. This German industrial conglomerate trades at attractive multiples while offering exposure to critical growth sectors including automation, digitalization, and sustainable energy. Siemens stands to benefit substantially from European infrastructure investments and the broader transition toward greener economies. Similarly, Total Energies presents an interesting value proposition. The French energy major has been more progressive than many peers in transitioning toward renewable energy while maintaining significant hydrocarbon assets. Trading at a discount to both historical valuation metrics and global competitors, Total offers both value and a strategic positioning for energy transition opportunities. Of course, investing in Europe isn't without challenges. Political fragmentation, demographic headwinds, and regulatory complexity have historically dampened investor enthusiasm. However, these concerns are increasingly reflected in asset prices, creating a margin of safety for new investments. The European Central Bank's monetary policy also appears more accommodative than the Federal Reserve's current stance, potentially creating a more favorable environment for European equities in the near term. FRANKFURT AM MAIN, GERMANY - OCTOBER 01:   (Photo by Hannelore Foerster\/Getty Images) For U.S. investors in particular, European exposure offers valuable portfolio diversification beyond the potential for individual stock returns. As trade tensions increase and global supply chains realign, having investment exposure across multiple economic regions reduces portfolio vulnerability to isolated shocks. The currency dynamics also merit consideration. After a period of dollar strength, many analysts anticipate a more favorable environment for the euro, potentially enhancing returns for dollar-based investors in European assets. While headline risks and historical underperformance have kept many investors away from European markets, the combination of compelling valuations, reconstruction opportunities, and quality businesses makes Europe increasingly difficult to ignore. As the global investment landscape shifts away from high-flying technology growth toward durable value, Europe's moment may finally have arrived.","label":1}

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"ByRichard Kestenbaum  ByRichard Kestenbaum , Contributor.  She doesn't shop the way her mom did.  The beauty industry boomed in 2022 and 2023, with foot traffic to beauty retail stores growing faster than in any other kind of retailer. That\u2019s what R.J. Hottovy, Head of Analytical Research at location analytics firm Placer.ai said at a recent Coresight event. From 2021 to 2023, in-store sales of beauty products grew at an average of 6.8% annually, according to a new report from NielsenIQ. That growth in foot traffic to stores has stabilized and is now declining, according to Hottovy. In December 2024 and January 2025, in-person visits to U.S. beauty stores declined by approximately 2% year-over-year he said. Even before the drop, in-store sales were rising no more than the inflation rate according to NielsenIQ. The decline in foot traffic doesn\u2019t spell trouble\u2014it signals a shift in beauty shopping behavior. According to NielsenIQ, 41% of all beauty and personal care product sales now happen online and Amazon dominating the shift. Mostly 1\/3 of Amazon\u2019s beauty growth came from consumers who moved away from beauty specialty stores and mass retailers like Walmart and Target, according to NielsenIQ. More transformative is the rise of social commerce. Though still a small segment, trends indicate it won\u2019t stay that way for long. Global Industry Cosmetics Magazine reports that 6.2% of beauty sales now come from social selling platforms, with TikTok alone capturing 2.6% of the market\u2014despite launching its commerce platform less than 18 months ago. Social commerce isn\u2019t just about sales\u2014it\u2019s reshaping consumer psychology. More than two-thirds of social commerce purchases are impulse-driven, and TikTok, despite past concerns over data trust security because of its Chinese ownership, is now considered more trusted by beauty shoppers than Facebook or Instagram, according to NielsenIQ. Most important, consumers like the social commerce experience. NielsenIQ says 84% of beauty shoppers who made a purchase via social commerce reported a good or excellent experience. Put it together and it means that social commerce is only just starting to take market share in the beauty industry. It\u2019s not just in where consumers are shopping that\u2019s changing, it\u2019s what they\u2019re buying. According to NielsenIQ, the top 10 beauty brands grew by an average of 2.2% in 2024, the top 20 brands saw 2.7% growth but the brands outside the top 20 grew at 6.9%. Consumers are actively looking for niche, independent, and innovative beauty lines over mainstream, legacy options. Sustainability is a major purchase driver because consumers want brands that align with their values. 55% of consumers say they\u2019re willing to pay more for environmentally-friendly beauty products. And brand loyalty is slipping, dropping by 20% over the past two years according toNielsenIQ. For brands and retailers, success in this evolving landscape requires agility. Winning in beauty today means: There aren\u2019t as many store openings now and some retailers are opening in smaller cities, often below 100,000 population, where competition is less intense. Second-tier cities in southern locations have become attractive growth opportunities, according to Hottovy of Placer.ai. There\u2019s plenty of opportunity and the beauty industry is still growing but the way it\u2019s growing is changing dramatically.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"After this final batch of Japanese cars, Nissan will pull the plug on the R35 for good After nearly two decades of embarrassing supercars, Nissan has officially stopped taking orders for the indomitable\u00a0R35 GT-R in Japan. That's its last surviving market, following its\u00a0retirement in Europe in 2022 and the U.S. in 2024. A statement on Nissan\u2019s Japanese website reads: \u201cWe have received many orders for the GT-R and have now finished accepting orders for the planned production quantity. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all our customers for their support since its release in 2007.\u201d That big lump you're feeling in your throat is because the R35 lived such a full life. Over its tenure, the 3.8-litre twin-turbo \u2018VR38\u2019 six-cylinder went from 474bhp to over 600 in the later\u00a0Nismo models. Paired with its trusty all-wheel-drive system and clever tech, the R35 lapped the N\u00fcrburgring some six seconds faster than\u00a0an Enzo back in 2013. As such, the R35 also went on to win big in motorsport, snatching titles in the GT1, Super GT and GT3 series\u2019 - the latter being closely associated with\u00a0Jann Mardenborough\u2019s rise in the\u00a0racing world. Mustn\u2019t forget its\u00a0conquering of many drag strips either. The R35 even found fame on the big screen, making several appearances in the Fast and Furious franchise. From battling\u00a0Dodge Challengers up twisty coastal passes to replicating\u00a0that\u00a0crouch-below-truck manoeuvre, the R35 took to Hollywood just as well as its predecessor did.

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"Even with a significant lead in the AI landscape with Siri, Apple is seemingly having trouble matching Microsoft and OpenAI's advanced efforts.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  The emergence of generative AI has propelled Microsoft and NVIDIA to the seat, each having briefly tasted the coveted world's most valuable company crown, with over $3 trillion in market capitalization. However, Apple seemingly kept the AI bubble at arm's length, sticking to CEO Tim Cook's \"not first, but best\" mantra. As you may know, Apple often attempts to stand out from the masses by developing well-crafted products rather than rushing to be the first in the market with a new product. As is the case with Apple Intelligence. The iPhone maker unveiled its AI strategy \u2014 Apple Intelligence late last year to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, and Google's Gemini. Interestingly, the AI strategy showed great promise at launch, propelling Apple to become the world's most valuable company ahead of Microsoft and NVIDIA with over $3 trillion in market valuation. However, a report highlighted concerns by Apple insiders, indicating that Apple Intelligence could be two years behind OpenAI's ChatGPT. Now, a new report by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman sheds more light on issues riddling Apple's AI strategy.  Apple unveiled its AI strategy in June 2024, and it features exciting features, including writing tools, voicemail transcriptions, Genmoji, and the Image Playground app. However, its release has been somewhat of a slow burn, rolling out in waves, potentially rendering the entire plot redundant. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Apple is seemingly playing it safe with AI, and for a good reason too. Generative AI has been riddled with critical issues, including security and privacy, which has prompted most users to refrain from leveraging its next-gen capabilities. On the other hand, OpenAI's ChatGPT is enjoying significant success in the AI landscape, quickly becoming a favorite among most iOS and Android users. Interestingly, Apple partnered with OpenAI to integrate its technology into Siri to complement its AI efforts. However, Apple Intelligence has seemingly reported underwhelming results. According to Apple insiders, users are seemingly struggling to adopt Apple Intelligence. And while the company claims iPhone sales are extremely high in regions where it offers the AI features, internal data shows that real-world usage is at an all-time low. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman: \"The feature feels like an afterthought and lacks conversational abilities.\" Apple showed great promise in AI, especially after unveiling its Siri digital assistant in 2011. However, it seemingly failed to keep up with the ever-evolving trends in the space, lagging behind its competitors' offerings. The launch of Apple Intelligence could have potentially presented the company with an opportunity to drive iPhone sales amid the depressed Chinese market. However, the company's slow rollout and lackluster features have made the situation worse. As you may know, Apple was criticized after its AI summaries feature was spotted generating erroneous news alerts. This forced the company to temporarily disable it while it worked on a permanent fix. Like Microsoft and Google, Apple has a broad user base, predominantly because of its versatile ecosystem. However, it has failed to leverage this competitive advantage to catch up with its competitors. However, Apple could redeem itself via a new software update, slated to be released in May. The update will reportedly ship with a next-gen version of Siri, which, unlike its predecessor, has a unified brain. The current version of Siri ships with two brains. For context, the first brain handles mundane tasks like setting timers and making calls, while the other handles more advanced and complex tasks. Initially, Apple Intelligence was supposed to ship in this format, but Apple was pressed on time to deliver the product in this form. However, Gurman claims that Apple could potentially ship its AI strategy as first intended via its iOS 19 software update. According to Mark Gurman: \"Apple\u2019s plan is to merge both systems together and roll out a new Siri architecture. I expect this to be introduced as early as Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference in June of this year \u2014 with a launch by spring 2026 as part of iOS 19.4. The new system, dubbed \u201cLLM Siri\u201d internally, was supposed to also introduce a more conversational approach in the same release. But that is now running behind as well and won\u2019t be unveiled in June.\" Following Apple's miscalculations with its AI strategy, insiders have highlighted concerns, indicating \"a true modernized, conversational version of Siri won\u2019t reach consumers until iOS 20 at best in 2027.\" This means Apple is approximately five years behind its competitors in the AI landscape. While Apple's AI strategy seems shaky at best, the software giant seems to be in more trouble. Insiders claim the company faces critical issues, including a shortage of advanced GPUs to power its advanced AI efforts as tech giants like Microsoft and OpenAI's demand for NVIDIA chips continues to rise. While the company is working to solve this issue with homegrown entries via its chips team, there are indications that rival firms are scouting and poaching talent from Apple, making the situation dire. Elsewhere, Apple recently transitioned veteran project manager Kim Vorrath into its Siri and AI division to bolster its efforts by \"whipping artificial intelligence and Siri into shape.\" Per the leaked memo from Apple AI lead John Giannandrea, the AI division will be focused on overhauling Siri\u2019s infrastructure and improving the company\u2019s in-house AI models.

{"date":"2025-03-03","content":"BySimon Moore  BySimon Moore , Senior Contributor.  Jerome Powell, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, during a House Financial Services Committee ... [+] hearing in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Feb. 12, 2025. The Fed has seven remaining meetings remaining in 2025 with the expectation that interest rates will likely be cut in in late summer assuming a degree of disinflation from upcoming CPI and PCE inflation reports. Photographer: Daniel Heuer\/Bloomberg The Federal Open Market Committee has seven remaining scheduled meetings for 2025 with the next on March 19. The expectation of fixed income markets is that interest rates will be cut in 2025 most likely two or three times. However, these cuts may be weighted towards later in the year, with the next interest rate cut most likely in June. There was no change in interest rates when the FOMC met in January. The FOMC\u2019s next two interest rate decisions on March 19 and May 7 are seen as less likely to deliver interest rate cuts with short term rates likely remaining at the current level of 4.25% to 4.5%. There\u2019s a very slim chance of a March interest rate cut currently. However, fixed income markets project that by June 18 or July 30 one, or possibly even two, interest rate cuts become more likely. Markets have less clarity for the remaining three meetings of the year with plenty of economic data incoming. Nonetheless, the final three scheduled interest rate decisions of September 17, October 29 and December 10 are expected to bring at least one or perhaps two more interest rate cuts compared to the earlier meetings. Overall, the view of the market is that interest rates are almost certainly coming down in 2025, with the main question being by how much. For example, Jerome Powell framed the question as not whether rates are going lower but how fast. \"With our policy stance now significantly less restrictive than it had been and the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance. We know that reducing policy restraint too fast or too much could hinder progress on inflation,\" at Senate testimony on February 11. However, in the view of markets the extent of lower interest rates spans a broad range with one to four interest rate cuts all quite possible and a slim chance of additional cuts later in 2025. The FOMC expect that inflation will trend closer to its 2% annual target over the remainder of 2025. Tariffs have the potential to complicate that picture by raising prices on imported goods. Nonetheless, the FOMC may chose to look through what could be a one-time increase in prices. Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler hinted at this saying, \"The potential net effect of new economic policies also remains highly uncertain and will depend on the breadth, duration, reactions to, and, importantly, specifics of the measures adopted,\" at a speech on February 20. The FOMC does not just look at inflation, and the market is perhaps becoming a little concerned that the Fed may need to act to help maintain employment levels. A recent wildcard are some early hints that the consumer may be softening and the jobs market might be losing a little momentum. This data is hard to parse as some of it appears to stem from consumer and business fears about tariffs rather than hard data on current economic realities. Nonetheless, sometimes economic fears can be self-fulfilling if they lead to tangible actions such as households trimming budgets and firms delaying expenditures. Overall though, the FOMC may cut rates if there\u2019s disinflation bringing inflation closer to target or if there\u2019s slowing jobs growth and a potential need to bolster the economy. One of these is a relatively rosy economic scenario, the other less so, nonetheless, either or both would likely see rate cutting by the FOMC. Ultimately it appears likely several interest rate cuts are coming in 2025. As Fed Governor Christopher Waller said in a speech on February 18, \"Waiting for economic uncertainty to dissipate is a recipe for policy paralysis.\" Nonetheless, what the economic data reveals over the coming months will inform how aggressive the FOMC is in cutting rates in 2025.","label":0}

Here's which iPhone is best for you in early 2025, depending on your budget. \r When Apple updates its main iPhone releases, it causes massive changes to the overall catalog, with model pricing shifts and older models disappearing from view. In the spring of 2025, another launch affected the product range in a different way. \rApple's introduction of the iPhone 16e did away with the iPhone SE line in favor of something closer to the main iPhone releases. It also made it tougher for those in the market for an iPhone to go for the cheapest option, as the pricing is now much closer between the variants. \rEven so, how much money you have available to spend is the first question. The second is what features are a must-have for you.\rHere are AppleInsider's recommendations for the iPhone you should strongly consider buying, based on your budget. \riPhone buyer's guide - Price rangesApple's iPhone lineup starts from $599 for the cheapest, rising up to $1,599 for the most expensive. The cheapest model is the newest iPhone 16e, while the most expensive configuration is the iPhone 16 Pro Max with the highest amount of storage. \r  iPhone 16e  \r        Apple's iPhone 16e has a 6.1-inch OLED Super Retina XDR display and supports Apple Intelligence.\r        Buy at AT&T   Buy at T-Mobile   Buy at Best Buy  There's a price range of $1,000 between the cheapest and most expensive models. When the iPhone 15 lineup came out, that price variance was $1,170, larger due to the cheaper third-gen iPhone SE that has been discontinued. \r The full range of iPhone pricing as of early 2025The vast majority of models stem from the iPhone 16 family, with two exceptions. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are survivors from the previous generation, taking the place in the range previously occupied by the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. \rThe inclusion of these previous-gen models had offered consumers a few more price points to consider in previous years. With the now more-expensive entry-level iPhone 16e in the list, the iPhone 15's appearance is more to offer more variations of features for your budget. \rAt the lower end of the scale, it's now a bit more condensed, so selecting based on budget alone is a bit harder. \rFor the purposes of this article, we will be splitting up the range into two sub-ranges: Under $1,000, and Above $1,000. \riPhone buyer's guide - The cost of storageA big thing to consider when looking at which iPhone to buy is storage capacity. Sure, you could get away with the basic storage option for a particular model, but you may run into problems eventually surrounding storage of apps, videos, and photos on the device.\rDepending on the model, consumers have between three and four storage options available. For most models, that's a choice between 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB of storage.\r Storage upgrade costs for iPhones, as of early 2025The exceptions to this range are at the more expensive end of the scale. The iPhone 16 Pro adds a 1TB option, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max adds 1TB but removes 128GB. \rAs for the actual cost of the upgrades, here's the charges to go between the levels: \rUpgrading from 128GB to 256GB costs $100 more. Upgrading from 256GB to 512GB costs $200 more.  Upgrading from 512GB to 1TB costs $200 more. iPhone buyer's guide for under $1,000The cheapest model is the $599 iPhone 16e with 128GB of storage. It's the only option available, but you do get a lot for your money. Packing the A18 chip, you get the 6.1-inch display, a 48MP Fusion camera with the fake telephoto zoom, and a massive 26 hours of battery life for video playback. \rYou gain an edge-to-edge display with Face ID, which is a massive step up from the iPhone SE. But you do have to live with the Notch instead of Dynamic Island. \r iPhone pricing below $1,000At $699, you could get the 256GB iPhone 16e, or you could get the 128GB model of iPhone 15. It's the older A16 chip here, so less performance and no Apple Intelligence, but there are two physical cameras including an Ultra Wide option, but the iPhone 16e is probably better here. \rGoing to $799, things get very interesting, as there are two more variants to consider, along the 256GB versions of iPhone 16e and iPhone 15. The iPhone 15 Plus turns up with its 6.7-inch display, but there's the iPhone 16 to consider. \rThe iPhone 16 has a 6.1-inch screen, a slightly graphically better A18 variant, dual cameras including Ultra Wide, the Camera Control button, and MagSafe. Battery is marginally less useful at 22 hours, but it is best buy of the group at this price. \rRising to $899, there are now a total of five options to seriously consider. There's the 512GB iPhone 16e, the 256GB iPhone 15 with a $100 saving, the 256GB iPhone 15 Plus, the 256GB iPhone 16, and the 128GB iPhone 16 Plus. \r  iPhone 16  \r        Apple's iPhone 16 is powered by the A18 chip and is built for Apple Intelligence.\r        Buy at AT&T   Buy at Verizon   Buy at T-Mobile   Again, it's really best to consider the iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Plus here, unless you desperately need higher levels of storage but less performance. \rHitting $999, the choice shifts up one step again. The iPhone 15 reaches its maximum capacity of 512GB, the iPhone 15 Plus and iPhone 16 stay at 256GB with a $100 saving, and the 256GB  iPhone 16 Plus is joined by the 128GB iPhone 16 Pro. \rThe Pro models offer a bit more than the non-Pro, with the iPhone 16 including a larger 6.3-inch display, titanium frame, a better A18 Pro chip, and more battery life. Even more importantly, there's the triple-camera system on the rear, with 48MP Fusion and Ultra Wide joined by a proper Telephoto camera, complete with the Tetraprism lens. \rAt this level, the decision is whether consumers should go for the much better camera or enjoy most of the performance but higher storage capacities. If you're into videography or photography, then the Pro is the better option, otherwise you may stick to the iPhone 16 or Plus models here. \riPhone buyer's guide for over $1,000After $1,000, the decision-making process largely boils down to two questions at each price point, beside capacity concerns. First, the previously-mentioned camera situation, which is quite important for some users. \rThe other is size, as sometimes having a larger display can be more desirable. \r iPhone pricing above $1,000At $1,099, the choice is either the iPhone 15 Plus or iPhone 16 at 512GB of storage, the iPhone 16 Plus at 256GB and a $100 saving, or the iPhone 16 Pro at 256GB. Really speaking, 256GB of storage is a decent amount, so the Pro is the best choice here. \r  iPhone 16 Pro  \r        Apple's iPhone 16 Pro has a Grade 5 titanium design and a 6.3-inch Super Retina XDR display.\r        Buy at AT&T   Buy at Verizon   Buy at T-Mobile  When we get to the $1,199 level, we have the last addition to the list. The iPhone 16 Pro Max steps in, complete with its 6.9-inch screen and skipping 128GB to start at 256GB. \rSpeaking frankly here, your main choices at these price levels are going to revolve around which Pro model you'll get. It's doubtful that many users will really capitalize on using 512GB of storage on the iPhone 16 Plus, and those who do will probably benefit from the USB 3 speeds of the Pro models against USB 2 for cable-based data transfers. \rAt $1,299, you're either going for the 512GB iPhone 16 Pro or the 256GB Pro Max and saving $100. It's a question of screen size versus storage at this point forward, as there's only two options available. \rThis carries on to $1,399 with 512GB of storage for both, but you'd save $100 on the Pro against the Pro Max. At $1,499, you could get a 1TB Pro, or save $100 on the 512GB Pro Max. \rLastly, at the highest point of the range, $1,599 gets you the iPhone 16 Pro Max with 1TB of storage. You should ask yourself if you really need so much storage, and if you could get away with saving a bit of money. \r  iPhone 16 Pro Max  \r        Apple's iPhone 16 Pro Max has a Grade 5 titanium design and a 6.3-inch Super Retina XDR display.\r        Buy at AT&T   Buy at Verizon   Buy at T-Mobile   iPhone buyer's guide - Storage or features?While less of a concern lower down the range, the choice between storage and features is a big one at the higher end. But, it is still a factor that should be considered throughout the range. \rRemember that a $100 or $200 capacity change can mean the difference between models or generations of iPhone available to you. In many places in the range, you could get a newer iPhone with better features for lower capacity, or you could secure more capacity for a lower specification elsewhere. \rA lot of the time, this can be seen with the cameras, with the Pro going for three physical sensors, and the iPhone 16e going for just one. If storage is important, you could feasibly get the iPhone 16e with the single camera and 512GB of storage for $899, saving $100 versus the iPhone 16 Pro with three cameras. \rThere is the temptation to avoid the iPhone 16e for the iPhone 15 line, just so you don't go for the dreaded \"e\" model or to avoid the display notch. However, the chip performance of the iPhone 15 means you will miss out on Apple Intelligence, which the cheaper model actually benefits from. \rIt's also arguable that storage is less of a concern now than it was before. In previous generations, consumers could get iPhones with 64GB of storage, or even less going further back. \rStarting with 128GB of storage puts even entry level users in a good position capacity-wise, with less of a need to consider external storage or cloud storage options. \rWith that line of thinking in mind, storage is less of a concern in 2025, and features should be more of a priority for you. \riPhone buyer's guide - Paying for it allThe information above is based on buying the models brand new and paying for them outright. While you can use third-party retailers with various offers to take advantage of, we have used the relatively standard pricing as if you were to buy from Apple directly. \rIf you can afford it, buying the handset outright is a great way to upgrade an iPhone. However, there are other ways if that's not an option. \rInstallment plans with carriers continue to be popular, but you can also do similar things with Apple directly. \rThere are options to buy from Apple and to finance the purchase over time. There's also the iPhone Upgrade Program, which lets you get a new iPhone every year and get coverage from AppleCare+ too. \rIf you have an existing iPhone that you're replacing, or another device, you can usually trade it in for credit towards your new model's purchase. Apple operates its own program for trade-ins, but you can still shop around to find the best trade-in value. \rWhere to buy Apple's iPhoneThe best way to save on a new iPhone is to check out wireless carrier deals, with the service providers offering incentives via bill credits and trade-in promotions that can sometimes bring the device down to free (applicable taxes do still apply).\rYou can hop straight to the carrier offers below. We also cover the best iPhone deals in our dedicated roundup.\rSave on iPhones at wireless carriers AT&T Wireless: Grab an iPhone for as low as $0 per month* with bill credits and trade-in offers Verizon: iPhones start at $0 per month* with incentives T-Mobile: Get up to 50% off* iPhones *Terms and conditions pertaining to each offer can be found on the specific carrier's site.

When Apple updates its main iPhone releases, it causes massive changes to the overall catalog, with model pricing shifts and older models disappearing from view. In the spring of 2025, another launch affected the product range in a different way. \r Apple's introduction of the iPhone 16e did away with the iPhone SE line in favor of something closer to the main iPhone releases. It also made it tougher for those in the market for an iPhone to go for the cheapest option, as the pricing is now much closer between the variants. \r Even so, how much money you have available to spend is the first question. The second is what features are a must-have for you.\r Here are AppleInsider's recommendations for the iPhone you should strongly consider buying, based on your budget. \r Apple's iPhone lineup starts from $599 for the cheapest, rising up to $1,599 for the most expensive. The cheapest model is the newest iPhone 16e, while the most expensive configuration is the iPhone 16 Pro Max with the highest amount of storage. \r There's a price range of $1,000 between the cheapest and most expensive models. When the iPhone 15 lineup came out, that price variance was $1,170, larger due to the cheaper third-gen iPhone SE that has been discontinued. \r The vast majority of models stem from the iPhone 16 family, with two exceptions. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are survivors from the previous generation, taking the place in the range previously occupied by the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. \r The inclusion of these previous-gen models had offered consumers a few more price points to consider in previous years. With the now more-expensive entry-level iPhone 16e in the list, the iPhone 15's appearance is more to offer more variations of features for your budget. \r At the lower end of the scale, it's now a bit more condensed, so selecting based on budget alone is a bit harder. \r For the purposes of this article, we will be splitting up the range into two sub-ranges: Under $1,000, and Above $1,000. \r A big thing to consider when looking at which iPhone to buy is storage capacity. Sure, you could get away with the basic storage option for a particular model, but you may run into problems eventually surrounding storage of apps, videos, and photos on the device.\r Depending on the model, consumers have between three and four storage options available. For most models, that's a choice between 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB of storage.\r The exceptions to this range are at the more expensive end of the scale. The iPhone 16 Pro adds a 1TB option, while the iPhone 16 Pro Max adds 1TB but removes 128GB. \r As for the actual cost of the upgrades, here's the charges to go between the levels: \r The cheapest model is the $599 iPhone 16e with 128GB of storage.

While we mentioned the Bitcoin strategic reserve, it appears the U.S. government plans to establish a much broader cryptocurrency portfolio beyond just Bitcoin. President Trump recently revealed on his Truth Social platform that his cryptocurrency strategic reserve will encompass BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, and ADA. This presidential announcement sparked significant market movement across the cryptocurrency sector. Bitcoin appreciated approximately 10% to exceed $94,600, Ethereum climbed 15% to $2,530, Solana jumped 25% to $178, and XRP experienced the most dramatic increase, surging over 33% to reach $2.90. Separately, see \u2013 Eli Lilly Stock: Should You Buy After A 20% Rise? Governments maintain strategic reserves of vital resources for national security, economic stability, and emergencies.These stockpiles, like the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve or central bank foreign exchange reserves, ensure supply during crises and stabilize prices. A cryptocurrency strategic reserve would function similarly, involving government acquisition of digital assets to manage markets, prepare for financial emergencies, or establish digital economic sovereignty. While the recent announcement has benefited all five cryptocurrencies mentioned by the president, XRP has demonstrated the strongest performance. Among various factors potentially supporting its long-term upward momentum, the most significant would be a positive update on its legal dispute with the SEC. Our earlier take on \u2013 What\u2019s Driving The XRP Rally? \u2013 has more details. Any favorable developments regarding XRP makes investors wonder if Ripple is progressing toward overcoming its regulatory challenges. While Mark Uyeda is the acting chair of the SEC, a crypto-friendly figure - Paul Atkins - is expected to assume that position, potentially creating a positive environment for cryptocurrencies broadly, particularly XRP. It is important to note that cryptocurrencies represent high-risk assets, and the potential for price appreciation is contingent upon the realization of these outcomes, thus rendering such investments speculative in nature.
