Gold subscribers can sign up for a checking or savings account through Robinhood later this year. by  Emma Roth If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Robinhood is getting closer to becoming a full-fledged financial service. On Wednesday, the company announced a wholly online banking platform that will offer checking and savings accounts to Robinhood Gold subscribers when it launches this fall. The platform, called Robinhood Banking, will let users access their accounts, as well as send and receive money through a dedicated app. It even attempts to make up for not having a physical location by having physical cash \u201cdelivered on-demand right to your doorstep.\u201d There still aren\u2019t many details about how this will work, but Robinhood says \u201ccoverage varies based on geographic location.\u201d Robinhood Banking promises a 4 percent annual percentage yield (APY) and FDIC insurance of up to $2.5 million on accounts. The company notes that since it\u2019s not an FDIC-insured bank, it\u2019s offering \u201cpass-through\u201d insurance provided by FDIC member Coastal Community Bank. Pass-through insurance involves insuring people\u2019s funds by holding them \u201cat an FDIC-insured bank through a third party,\u201d according to the FDIC. The service will offer individual and joint banking accounts at launch, along with options to create children\u2019s accounts. Deepak Rao, Robinhood Money\u2019s general manager and vice president, says the platform is designed to \u201csolve many of the challenges presented by legacy banks.\u201d In addition to a bank account, Robinhood is launching a new wealth management platform called Robinhood Strategies. It will offer access to a mix of single stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which \u201care actively managed to provide access to more opportunities.\u201d The funds have a 0.25 percent annual management fee, with a yearly cap of $250 for Robinhood Gold members.  Robinhood Strategies is available to Robinhood Gold members today, but it\u2019s coming to all customers next month. Robinhood Gold is the company\u2019s $5 per month (or $50 per year) subscription program that offers features like margin investing and larger instant deposits.  Later this year, Robinhood also plans to launch an AI-powered investment tool called Cortex for Gold subscribers. It will provide analyses and insights about the current market, such as why a particular stock is going up or down, as well as which stocks to consider trading. Over the years, Robinhood has transformed itself from a simple investing app into an all-in-one hub for users\u2019 finances. The company launched a credit card in 2024 as part of efforts to encourage people to keep their money within the widening Robinhood ecosystem, where they\u2019ll now be able to store and withdraw cash to make investments on the app, too.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"The major stock indexes closed down on Wednesday. President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday plans to slap 25% tariffs on all imported cars, escalating a global trade war just weeks after previous tariffs touched off a market rout and triggered concern about a possible recession. \"I think our automobile industry will flourish like it hasn't before,\" Trump said. The 25% tariffs will be applied to imported passenger vehicles, including cars, SUVs, minivans, cargo vans and light trucks, according to a White House fact sheet released after Trump's Oval Office remarks. The tariffs will also be applied to key imported auto parts, including engines, powertrain parts and electrical components. The White House noted that 50% of the roughly 16 million cars purchased in the U.S. last year were imports. Of the 8 million assembled in the U.S., the White House estimated those cars only have roughly 50% domestically produced content. \"Therefore, of the 16 million cars bought by Americans, only 25% of the vehicle content can be categorized as Made in America,\" the White House argued in its fact sheet. The tariffs on autos are set to go into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 3 -- one day after Trump's planned reciprocal tariffs kick in. The tariffs on auto parts are set to go into effect no later than May 3, according to the White House proclamation. The White House fact sheet said Trump is imposing the tariffs to protect the U.S. auto industry, \"which is vital to national security and has been undermined by excessive imports threatening America's domestic industrial base and supply chains.\" The U.S. already imposes a 2.5% tariff on passenger car imports and a 25% tariff on imported pickup trucks. The auto tariffs are set to target a sector that employs more than a million U.S. workers and relies on a supply chain intricately intertwined with Mexico and Canada. Tariffs placed on the auto industry risk raising car prices for U.S. consumers, experts previously told ABC News. Of the 16 million new cars sold in the U.S. in 2024, about 8.7 million -- or 54% -- were made in the U.S., according to Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst covering North and South America for the Auto Intelligence service at S&P Global Mobility. About 7.3 million -- or 46% -- were imported. Brinley predicted prices will go up after dealers sell through current inventory, in about 1 and \u00bd to 2 months, but customers won't see a direct line-item charge for tariffs on the sticker price because carmakers and dealers have some wiggle room to maneuver across product lines and inventory. However, prices are expected to go up across the board. In addition, used car prices are poised to increase, tracking the rise in new car prices and because supply is already limited. Car insurance premiums are also about to become more expensive, experts say. The average cost of a new imported car is expected to jump $6,000 according to Cox Automotive. And experts say the entire auto market in the U.S., even for cars made here, are expected to see price increases. Many of the more affordable vehicles sold in the U.S. come from Mexico. The move upends decades of free trade between the U.S., Mexico and Canada. Mexico and Canada make up the top two U.S. trading partners for both finished motor vehicles and car parts, according to an analysis of data from the U.S. International Trade Commission by Cato Institute, a right-leaning think tank. In 2023, Canada and Mexico accounted for nearly $120 billion worth of U.S. motor vehicle imports, which totaled about 47% of all such vehicles imported that year. Canada and Mexico made up nearly the same share of auto parts imports that year, the Cato Institute analysis showed. When it comes to auto parts that are covered under the free trade United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), importers will have the chance to \"certify\" the U.S. content, according to the White House fact sheet. The 25% tariff will only apply to the value of non-U.S. content -- and only after the Commerce Department and U.S. Customs and Border Protection come up with a process to apply those tariffs, according to the fact sheet. During a press conference held at the Ambassador Bridge, new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called the measure \"a direct attack on our workers\" and said he would convene a meeting of his cabinet on U.S. relations to discuss trade options. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce said in a statement: \"The consequences of today's escalation in this destructive tariff war will not be contained to Canada, as much as the U.S. administration would like to pretend. Throwing away tens of thousands of jobs on both sides of the border will mean giving up North America's auto leadership role, instead encouraging companies to build and hire anywhere else but here. This tax hike puts plants and workers at risk for generations, if not forever. \" Trump announced tariffs earlier this month on a large share of U.S. auto imports when he slapped 25% duties on Mexico and Canada, but the president soon afterward issued a delay of auto-related duties associated with that policy. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt previewed the fresh auto tariffs in remarks on Wednesday afternoon, sending U.S. stocks lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 130 points, or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 dropped 1.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 2%. Shares of U.S. automakers also fell. Tesla, the electric carmaker led by Trump-advisor Elon Musk, closed down 5.5%. Shares of General Motors dropped 3%. The announcement of auto tariffs arrives days before Trump is set to issue a new round of duties on April 2. Trump has repeatedly referred to that date as \"liberation day,\" saying a wide-ranging slate of reciprocal tariffs would rebalance U.S. trade relationships. Speaking at the White House on Monday, Trump softened his posture, saying the reciprocal tariffs could fall short of the rate that target countries impose on U.S. goods. \"I may give a lot of countries breaks,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"I'm embarrassed to charge them what they've charged us.\" South Korea, Japan, Mexico and Canada do not impose tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles. The auto tariffs follow a flurry of duties imposed earlier this month. Trump slapped tariffs on China in early March, raising taxes on goods from that country to 20%. Days later, Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on all aluminum and steel imports. The moves prompted retaliatory tariffs from China, the European Union and Canada, setting off a trade war that roiled the stock market and prompted warnings from Wall Street of a potential recession. Economists widely expect tariffs to raise prices for consumers, since importers typically pass along a share of the tax burden to shoppers. Speaking at a press conference in Washington, D.C., last Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell faulted tariffs for a \"good part\" of recent inflation. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":1}
{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Business Insider Edition  It's been a rough year for Tesla \u2014 and a very good one for its Chinese rivals.          While Tesla's stock has climbed a little in recent days, it is down 40% since mid-December. By contrast, its Chinese rivals' share prices have surged on the back of booming sales and breakthroughs in autonomous driving and EV charging.               BYD's share price has risen almost 40% so far in 2025 and hit a record high last week after it unveiled new charging tech it says can charge an EV in five minutes.               EV startup Xpeng has seen an 85% rise in its share price in the first three months of the year, while Nio and automotive conglomerate Geely \u2014 which owns EV startup Zeekr and others \u2014 have also enjoyed double-digit share price rallies.               The stock divergence comes as Tesla faces numerous challenges in China, its second-largest market behind the US.               Once the most innovative player in the world's largest car market, Elon Musk's automaker has lost market share as local rivals have undercut Tesla on price with a wave of affordable EVs and hybrids.               The likes of BYD, Xiaomi, and Xpeng are now eyeing up Tesla's tech crown too, packing their cars with new autonomous driving and AI features and branching out into humanoid robots and flying cars.               As warning lights flash across Elon Musk's EV empire, here are four reasons the billionaire should be most worried about China.               Tesla has seen sales plunge around the globe this year \u2014 but the drop in China comes as its local rivals enjoy a sales boom.               Sales of Teslas manufactured in China dropped nearly 50% in February compared to the previous year, even as BYD saw its own sales rise by 161%.               This week, BYD released its 2024 annual results, revealing that it had surpassed Tesla in overall revenue. It reported revenues of 777 billion yuan, equivalent to around $107 billion at the latest exchange rate. By contrast, Tesla had revenue of $97 billion in 2024.               The 30,688 vehicles Elon Musk's company shipped from its Shanghai plant was the lowest since August 2022, and was only narrowly ahead of rival Xpeng.               Tesla's sales will likely get a boost in the coming months from the rollout of an upgraded version of its best-selling Model Y, with deliveries beginning this month.               But the company still faces a raft of competition from more affordable alternatives such as smartphone-maker Xiaomi's SU7 electric sedan, prices of which start around $6,000 cheaper than Tesla's new Model Y.               After years of waiting, Tesla owners in China have finally got access to some of the company's 'Full Self-Driving' features.               The company began rolling out limited driver-assist features last month to Chinese users who have paid about $8,800 extra for access.               That sum is only slightly less than the cost of BYD's cheapest car \u2014 the $9,500 Seagull EV \u2014 and it came after Tesla's Chinese rival announced it would install its own autonomous driving tech on its entire model lineup for free.               BYD's announcement set off a ripple effect across the industry.               Other EV makers, like Xpeng and Zeekr, quickly announced they would include driver-assist features on upcoming models. Zeekr CEO Andy An told CNBC that the EV startup would follow BYD's lead by offering the features at no extra cost.               Weeks after unveiling its \"God's Eye\" autonomous tech, BYD made headlines around the globe again as it announced a new EV charging system that promised to charge an electric vehicle in five minutes.               The automaker says its new 1,000 kW chargers can add 250 miles of range in five minutes, outstripping Tesla's current superchargers, which can add 200 miles of range in 15 minutes.               The unveiling of BYD's \"super e-platform\" last Tuesday sent the company's stock surging to a\u00a0record high, pushing Tesla's share price down on the same day.               Tesla's supercharger network has been crucial to the company's EV expansion, but BYD's announcement suggests the Chinese firm has taken a key technological lead over its rival.               Right now, the pressures Tesla is facing from its Chinese rivals are confined to China \u2014 but that may not stay the case for very long.               China's EV makers are increasingly going global as they look to expand beyond the country's hyper-competitive domestic market.               Exports of EVs and hybrids from China hit a record high in January, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, and BYD reported successive record overseas sales in January and February.               While China's EV giants are blocked from competing with Tesla in the US thanks to high tariffs, the likes of BYD, Xpeng, and Zeekr are expanding rapidly in Europe, where Tesla's sales have plummeted in the first few months of the year.           In the UK, which has no tariffs on Chinese EVs, BYD outsold Tesla for the first time in January, and Tesla's sales in Europe were also overtaken by Chinese state-owned manufacturer SAIC Motor.               Competition from Chinese brands is likely to grow, with Xiaomi president William Lu confirming that the company plans to sell EVs globally \"within the next few years\" earlier this month.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Universities could face multi-million-pound fines for breaches of freedom of speech rules, the Office for Students (OfS) said. The University of Sussex was fined \u00a3585,000 after the OfS said its equality policy - which included rules to \"positively represent trans people\" - could prevent staff and students voicing opposing views. Sussex was investigated after Prof Kathleen Stock left the university in 2021 accused of transphobia. Arif Ahmed, OfS director for freedom of speech, said the fine could have been as high as \u00a33.7m and there was \"potential for higher fines in the future\". Universities have told the OfS they were concerned about how to uphold free speech while preventing hate speech. The University of Sussex was the first to be fined under new powers given to the OfS in January. The higher education regulator's investigation examined the university's trans and non-binary equality policy, which said that course material must \"positively represent trans people and trans lives\" and also said \"transphobic propaganda... [would] not be tolerated\". The watchdog said the \"chilling effect\" this would have on anyone wanting to voice an opposing view meant the university failed in its duty to uphold freedom of speech on campus. Prof Kathleen Stock, who left the university in 2021 after being accused of transphobia for her views on sex and gender issues, has said other universities should pay attention to the record fine issued to Sussex. Writing for the website Unherd, she said she tried hard to \"raise the alarm\" about the impact of trans policies at universities on free speech, but added many were still in place, describing them as \"dim witted and claustrophobic\". The University of Sussex plans to legally challenge the OfS findings, vice-chancellor Prof Sasha Roseneil said. The OfS investigation into the University of Sussex started with the case of Prof Stock in 2021. The OfS report concluded that Prof Stock \"felt unable to teach certain topics\" and feared disciplinary action as a result of the university's policy. Describing the judgement as an \"unreasonably absolutist definition of free speech\", the university said the ruling would leave institutions \"powerless to prevent abusive, bullying and harassing speech\". The OfS, it added, had pursued a \"vindictive and unreasonable campaign\" against the university. It also said the OfS had failed to respond to the university's requests to engage with its staff in person, with Prof Roseneil describing the investigation as a \"trawl of documents\". But Dr Ahmed defended the investigation and its ruling on Wednesday, saying that \"we communicated with them and they communicated with us\". He added: \"I think universities should be looking at their policies and thinking carefully about what they need to do to comply with the law and to comply with regulatory requirements.\" The report said maximum penalties for universities would be capped at whichever is higher: 2% of a university's annual \"qualifying income\" - the amount they receive from tuition fees and OfS grants - or \u00a3500,000. Many universities post incomes in the hundreds of millions every year, meaning maximum fines could comfortably reach seven figures. The University of Sussex fine was capped at \u00a34.6m, the OfS said, adding that an \"appropriate deterrent\" against future breaches could be achieved with the lower fine. \"Clearly, future cases will not be the first case of their kind, so there will be a potential for higher fines in the future,\" Dr Ahmed said on Wednesday. The OfS was given the power to issue fines where freedom of speech was not upheld at a university in January. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson described free speech and academic freedom as \"non-negotiables\" in universities, adding that the OfS would get stronger powers to handle such cases so that students and academics are not \"muzzled\" by restraints on free speech. Police in London say PhD student Zhenhao Zou's \"offending group is far greater\" than they had realised. The University and College Union says up to 1,000 jobs will be put at risk by planned cutbacks. Critics say the Seren scheme focuses too much on Oxbridge and takes money and talent away from Wales. CEO Sara-Jane Watkins says the move to Pershore will provide a better learning experience for students. Yukun Tao says his adventure has motivated others as he prepares to drive back later this year.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Business Insider Edition  Wall Street's \"barbarians at the gate\" are slowing down after nearly 25 years of beating the stock market. This has big implications for anyone contemplating a career in private equity.          Earlier this month, the investment firm Hamilton Lane issued a report showing that the MSCI World Index, a leading stock market indicator, beat out private equity returns for the first time since the dot-com bubble burst in 2000. Hamilton Lane's data represents performance through September 2024 for buyout funds that started investing in 2022.               Prior to this, the leveraged buyout industry, also known as private equity, had been on a tear. Sure, it felt some pain during the housing crash and the following recession, but that also meant that interest rates stayed lower for longer \u2014 paving the way for cash-rich companies like Blackstone to pick up assets on the cheap, which helped drive returns and more investors. In July 2023, Blackstone became the first private equity firm to manage $1 trillion in assets \u2014 three years ahead of the company's prediction to investors.               As Apollo CEO Marc Rowan said at a presentation last year, much of the industry's returns over the past 15 years (he excluded Apollo's) \"was not the result of great investing, but as a result of $1 trillion in money printing.\"               \"Well, guess what?\" he continued. \"We stopped printing that magnitude of money.\"               Indeed, since interest rates started ticking higher, financial sponsor dealmaking has slowed, IPOs have ground to a halt, and dry powder (industry speak for money yet to be invested) has stood at near all-time highs even as fundraising slowed by almost half from its 2021 peak.               That's not to say that the industry broadly known as \"private equity\" is dead \u2014\u00a0or that all buyout funds have underperformed stocks in recent years. Quite the opposite. Firms such as Blackstone and Apollo have been busy issuing loans and investing in large infrastructure projects (think data centers). Indeed, Apollo's lending business is now nearly 10 times the size of its traditional buyout business.               What does it all mean for budding masters of the universe looking for a career in private equity? We spoke with a range of experts, including industry insiders, consultants, and recruiters, to understand what is ahead for professionals looking to break into the lucrative field of private-market investing.       \"Private equity was able to get lazy because of ZIRP.\"           They said there was no shortage of opportunities for aspiring financiers who know where to look. Private equity's loss has been private credit's gain, and within private equity, there are more opportunities than ever for pure-play operations experts skilled at running businesses.               As Robin Judson, the founder of the recruiting firm Robin Judson Partners, put it: \"I think that people who want to do private equity will pursue it, while people who just want to invest may look toward other strategies.\"               Here's a guide to a career in private equity as the golden age of corporate buybacks gives way to private credit and other types of dealmaking.               When interest rates started rising in 2022, company valuations remained aloft, making it harder for buyout firms, which rely heavily on debt to make purchases, to find deals that could generate returns. This has led to a shift in demand for professionals who know how to drive returns by changing how a business is run, said Glenn Mincey, KPMG's head of US private equity.               \"This recalibration has given professionals in the industry new focus outside of buying and selling companies,\" Mincey told BI.               Indeed, these pros used to be called in to help manage a company after it was purchased. Increasingly, they are getting involved in advance of an acquisition because they are often best positioned to know how to maximize performance through operational improvements.               The largest firms will hire teams of operational pros with expertise such as technological transformation, supply chain and logistics, or talent acquisition and management. Even traditional deal professionals have become more operationally focused.               \"Private equity was able to get lazy because of ZIRP,\" a VP at a mid-market private equity firm told BI, referring to the acronym for the Federal Reserve's zero interest rate policy response to financial crises starting in 2001. \"That's gone away \u2014 you have to know your shit now,\" this person added.               This hands-on, entrepreneurial approach can be seen in the growing rise of so-called search funds. Sometimes described as mini-private equity, a search fund is a small private equity fund run by one or two people that is focused on purchasing one small business like a carwash or an HVAC company. Once purchased, the fund works on streamlining operations and creating value.               A 2024 Stanford Business School study found that search fund creation hit an all-time high in 2023, the latest year with data, with more than 90 first-time search funds raised. This strategy is attracting a younger group of professionals right out of business school, or even before business school, with Stanford finding that nearly 80% of first-time fundraisers in 2023 clocked in at 35 or younger.               The same high interest rates and global uncertainty that have dampened the traditional private equity industry have made nonbank lending, also known as private credit, more attractive.               Even in a tough economy, \"companies still need capitalization,\" explained Judson. And with banks pulling back on riskier lending, private investors have stepped in to offer \"more creative financing solutions,\" she said.               Blackstone, which made its name in private equity and then real estate investing, saw its credit business grow to become the largest business in its portfolio by assets under management last year. Apollo now counts more than 80% of its $751 billion in assets under management as private credit.               As Kevin Desai, the leader of PWC's private equity advisory practice, told BI in January, the private credit job market is hot in part because there simply aren't enough people with direct experience to fill lenders' needs. One reason is that private credit firms want professionals with lending experience.               That means recruiting from the debt-raising or trading arms of investment banks \u2014 or really anyone with lending knowledge who can be trained.               Nelson Chu, the CEO and founder of the private credit investment marketplace Percent, told BI that his firm had also recruited talent from debt rating agencies like Morningstar and Moody's. Its often worked out so well that the firm has seen its workers get quickly poached after they get up to speed, he added.               Anthony Keizner, the cofounder and managing partner of Odyssey Search Partners, told BI that hiring was \"very buoyant\" in certain private equity businesses, including the popular and dry-powder-rich niches of secondaries, buying and selling of stakes in other private funds, and infrastructure.               The slowdown in the traditional private equity business of buyouts is felt most acutely in midlevel and senior positions, he said.               \"Most buyout firms have slowed their hiring plans in 2025 compared to the recent boom years,\" he said. \"Many private equity firms feel they are adequately staffed at current deal volume levels.\"               Hiring at the junior level remains active, he said \u2014 a sentiment echoed by Tim Roth, a partner at the advisory firm Armanino Advisory.               \"I don't believe junior hiring is decreasing, but I think it's becoming more competitive to get a shot,\" Roth told BI, noting that AI could exacerbate the challenge.               For professionals who have already broken into the business, there's less pay but not a lot of eagerness to jump ship either. One reason is that PE firms still have a ton of dry powder to invest and portfolio companies to sell when the time is right.               \"I tell candidates not to leave their jobs right now without having another job,\" Judson said. \"If you have a job, assuming the portfolio is sustainable, you will eventually get paid.\"               The private equity VP agreed. \"I haven't heard of many people at my level looking to run for the exits,\" he told BI. Even with realizations, and therefore carry and bonuses lower, the industry still offers \"the highest upside\" for compensation, he said.       Private equity, with its tie to interest rates and the overall health of the economy, is a cyclical business. Previous golden ages, like the 1980s or the early 2000s, also ended, and new ones rose up in their stead.               \"The key word right now is stagnation,\" Judson said. \"Nobody knows how long this uncertainty is going to last. Is it going to last for months or years?\"Do you work in private equity? Looking to join the industry?

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Business Insider Edition  Shopping for homes online once had the feel of an open-air market: crowded and sweaty, maybe, but free for anyone to drop by and see what's for sale. The experience these days, though, is quickly turning into that of a nightclub, with the hottest new listings sequestered behind velvet ropes. If you want to party with the cool kids \u2014 in this case, score access to homes before regular folks \u2014 you better know a guy.          The wide-open nature of the housing market has been breaking down for a while. Most real estate agents have traditionally taken a maximalist approach to marketing homes, sharing listings widely through local databases known as multiple listing services. Agents browse the MLS to get details on homes available for sale, while search portals like Zillow pull the data onto their own websites for regular home shoppers to scroll through. The thinking is simple: More eyes on a listing means more potential bidders, giving a homeowner the best chance of selling quickly and lucratively.               This model is even backstopped by the National Association of Realtors, a powerful industry group that sets the rules for most MLSes around the country. NAR instituted a rule in 2020 known as the clear cooperation policy, which says that once a real estate agent starts marketing a home publicly \u2014 on a website, through an email blast, or even with a \"for sale\" sign in the front yard \u2014 they must list it on the MLS within one day. The rule was meant to prevent freeloading and encourage participation in the MLS, keeping listings in one place for other agents and their clients to see.               In recent years, however, the clear cooperation rule has been challenged by some of the biggest players in the game, who want to act as the new bouncers for VIP rooms filled with exclusive home listings. In particular, Compass, the country's largest real estate brokerage by sales volume, wants to take charge of the aforementioned velvet rope. Compass agents are increasingly hoarding their listings internally, shunning the MLS and making homes available only to buyers who work with other Compass agents. The company's founder and CEO, Robert Reffkin, has also been crusading against the clear cooperation policy. Reffkin argues that sellers should reject the one-size-fits-all approach of the MLS and exert more control over how their home is marketed. His campaign has stoked fierce infighting among real estate agents and raised a fundamental question: Who should be able to see the homes for sale in the US?               For now, the fight is ongoing. After months of debate, NAR said Tuesday it would leave the clear cooperation policy intact while adding another rule that functions as a small concession to Compass. The apparent attempt at compromise will probably end up pleasing no one. But while clear cooperation remains in place for now, the housing market continues to hurtle toward a decidedly uncooperative future.               Those in favor of clear cooperation argue the rule is responsible for America's uniquely transparent housing market \u2014 the reason you can hop on Zillow or Realtor.com and get the lay of the land. The policy was supposed to stem the rise of so-called \"pocket listings,\" homes marketed for sale but unavailable on the MLS. If agents stop contributing listings to the shared databases, many in the industry warn, a once unified housing market could break up into silos, with home listings distributed among clubby groups of brokers known as \"private listing networks\" or gatekept within brokerages like Compass.               In this world, some agents will have access to a lot more properties than others. Pick the wrong rep, and you could unknowingly miss out on your dream home. And while there are good reasons someone might not want their house touted on the MLS \u2014 a celebrity like Brad Pitt, for instance, probably doesn't want their business aired out for everyone to see \u2014 conventional wisdom says sharing a home widely is the best way to get top dollar.               \"Everybody benefits when we all pool our listings, and we do so in a timely manner,\" Saul Klein, a longtime real estate executive who's the CEO of the San Diego Multiple Listing Service, previously told me. \"And people are hurt, potentially, when we don't do that.\"               But it's become increasingly clear that the advocates for the open system are losing. Yes, NAR kept the clear cooperation rule in place, but it also introduced an option for privacy-conscious sellers to list on the MLS while delaying their listings from popping up on sites like Zillow or the landing pages for other brokerages. The idea is to give sellers more flexibility to market their homes as they see fit, catering to those who may prefer to \"premarket\" their home before blasting it out widely. The move doesn't go nearly as far as Compass would have liked, but the company still frames this as a validation of its rallying cry for more seller choice.               \"With NAR introducing a new MLS policy to 'expand choice for consumers,' they acknowledged the clear cooperation policy restricted home seller choice,\" Reffkin said in a statement. \"Expanding choice means that NAR is still not letting homeowners choose precisely how to market their homes, but this is a small step in the right direction.\"               Compass may not be totally happy with NAR's most recent decision, but the company has already succeeded in shaking up the real estate landscape. The brokerage has made plenty of hay by exploiting a glaring loophole in the clear cooperation rules. While an agent has to add the listing to the MLS database once they publiclyput the home up for sale, the rule allows agents to share new properties within their brokerages without adding them to the MLS. This method, which Compass dubbed the \"Private Exclusive\" route, essentially creates a walled garden with homes that can't be found anywhere else. Compass drives traffic to its website, collects a commission from both sides of the deal, and can lure both agents and clients by offering access to its inventory. Private exclusives have become a key strategy for the brokerage giant: Reffkin told analysts in February that 35% of the company's active listings nationwide were only available by working with a Compass agent or visiting Compass.com.               This isn't just some self-serving maneuver, either, Compass execs argue. They say sellers benefit from spurning the MLS and marketing their homes within the safe confines of the Compass network. The MLS and search portals like Zillow show how long a house has been on the market and whether the price has been slashed, data points that buyers can use to put pressure on homeowners in negotiations. The Compass website doesn't show price cuts or days on the market, theoretically allowing a seller to test their ideal price without any repercussions if they have to backtrack. And if they don't sell that way, they can always turn to the MLS and go the conventional route for maximum exposure. Compass likens this strategy to beta testing a product with a smaller audience before launch.               \"We firmly believe that homeowners should have full control and flexibility in choosing how they market their home, period, full stop,\" Ashton Alexander, the head of strategy at Compass, tells me.               Brian Boero, the CEO of 1000Watt, a brand and marketing agency for real estate companies, doesn't buy it. Compass, he says, is really after control. Under the existing rule, the company may be free to pursue its \"Private Exclusives\" strategy, but it can't, for instance, publicly market a home on its website without also contributing to the MLS.               \"They want to make Compass.com a destination where they control the inventory publicly, and they want to have free rein to continue to expand their private listings program,\" Boero tells me. \"So they didn't get what they wanted.\"               Compass is far from the only large brokerage to employ this kind of strategy \u2014 Coldwell Banker, for instance, has \"Exclusive Look,\" Howard Hanna has \"Find It First,\" and one large Keller Williams franchise, KW Go, has dubbed its offering \"Private Collection.\" More companies have threatened to follow the lead and keep listings off the MLS if it helps them compete for agents and clients. The clear cooperation policy has always been tough to enforce, too, with the onus placed on local MLSes to keep agents in line. Some MLSes, fearing litigation, have already backed off enforcement, tacitly allowing agents to market homes however they like. This could enable private listing networks \u2014 groups of typically high-achieving agents from different brokerages who share off-MLS listings among each other \u2014 to flourish.               NAR's decision to keep clear cooperation is a small victory for those who favor the status quo, but it will hardly end the practices fracturing the housing market. Compass hasn't ruled out the possibility of litigation over the rule, either. For now, the real estate industry is stuck in a sort of limbo. No one doubts that secret listings will continue to rise, but the fight over the clear cooperation policy isn't going anywhere.               \"Everybody loses here, in a way,\" Boero tells me. \"Nobody's happy.\"       James Rodriguez is a senior reporter on Business Insider's Discourse team.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Business Insider Edition  Good morning. A fitness influencer went viral for his elaborate morning routine \u2014 and his penchant for Saratoga spring water. It's not just for drinking. Oh no. He uses it to fill a bowl of ice water and then repeatedly dunk his face into it.          While I won't be adopting the morning routine myself, one person told BI they thought it was \"amazing:\" Saratoga water's CMO.               In today's big story, the climate of private equity is changing. Experts told BI what it means for your career.       What's on deck   Markets: The Trump family is getting into another corner of the crypto scene: stablecoin.       Tech: Military social media is roasting officials' use (or misuse) of Signal.       Business: Big real-estate brokerages want to gatekeep your next dream home.               But first, looking for a career in private equity?       If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.           Higher interest rates have slowed private equity way down. Dealmaking has slumped, initial public offerings have all but ground to a halt, and the uninvested money firms are sitting on is at a high \u2014 even as fundraising has fallen off a cliff from the heady days of 2021.               That's not to say that private equity is dead \u2014 or that all buyout funds have underperformed stocks in recent years. Quite the opposite, BI's Alex Nicoll writes.               The same high interest rates and global uncertainty that have dampened the traditional private equity industry have supercharged nonbank lending, also known as private credit. Apollo now counts more than 80% of its $751 billion in assets under management as private credit.       What does it mean for those looking for a career in private equity?           A range of experts, from industry insiders to consultants and recruiters, told BI what's ahead for professionals looking to break into or move up in the lucrative field of private-market investing.               \"This recalibration has given professionals in the industry new focus outside of buying and selling companies,\" said Glenn Mincey, KPMG's head of US private equity.               Hot opportunities still abound if you know where to look, including the portfolio operator and those who go it alone through search funds.       1. Goldman Sachs to investors: Buckle up. News of Trump potentially softening tariffs next month had the stock market jumping for joy on Monday. But Goldman Sachs outlined two reasons investors should still brace for a negative surprise.       2. Consumer sentiment is plunging, and that's not good for stocks. Americans aren't feeling great about the economy, with the Consumer Confidence Index dropping to its lowest level since early 2021. Wall Street is eyeing the risk of weaker corporate earnings as consumers pull back.       3. Trump's got a new digital asset. World Liberty Financial, the crypto venture backed by the president and his sons, is getting into the stablecoin game with a new token. It'll be backed by short-term Treasuries, dollar deposits, and cash equivalents, the firm said in a press release.       1. Traditional media is losing older people to YouTube. According to Nielsen data, YouTube beat out Netflix and Disney last month in total US TV watching, and that's partly thanks to viewers 50 and older. It's yet another alarm bell for Hollywood.       2. Military social media had a field day with the Signal fiasco. Veterans roasted the top Trump officials involved in Signalgate, flooding the internet with memes of Pete Hegseth and JD Vance.       3. Napster is making a comeback. Is it 1999? Yes, it still exists, much to many millennials' surprise. The OG music-sharing platform was sold for $207 million to Infinite Reality, which seems to be planning to use it for a metaverse play involving virtual concerts.       1. It's about to get a lot harder to find your dream home. A key real estate market rule that keeps home listings transparent is being challenged by some of the industry's biggest players. Home listings could soon be gatekept by big brokerages, meaning some people will see many more options than others.       2. Another hybrid work policy bites the dust. Boutique investment bank Moelis & Co. is ending its remote work allowance and calling all employees back into the office five days a week starting in May. RIP, WFH.       3. Anxious retirees are calling the AARP in droves. The AARP has seen a surge in calls from seniors worried about the Trump administration's cuts to the Social Security Administration. They're concerned about how it will affect their Social Security benefits \u2014 and they have reason to be.       The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Instead of cheap squircle Moto Watches or wearable smartphone gimmicks, I just want the Moto 360 with modern hardware and Wear OS 5.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.   My weekly column focuses on the state of Wear OS, from new developments and updates to the latest apps and features we want to highlight. I don't regret being late to the Wear OS party, missing years of buggy updates and terrible battery life. But my colleagues keep bringing up the gorgeous Moto 360 like it's the smartwatch holy grail. Now, I'm waiting impatiently for Motorola to follow in OnePlus and Xiaomi's footsteps and jump back on the Wear OS train. I haven't spent that much time with Motorola phones, aside from the Razr Plus (2023) that I used to tempt my now-fiancee away from her iPhone. I enjoyed the foldable gimmick, but it's hard to stay too invested without a compelling Motorola smartwatch to pair with one. Since I joined Android Central, Motorola has stuck with cheap squircles like the Moto Watch 40 and budget-minded circular models like the Watch 120, with the generic health tracking, week+ battery life, and basic smarts you'd expect in the $70\u2013140 price range. I don't blame Motorola for leaving the old version of Android Wear behind. But 2025 should be a transformative year for Wear OS, and even if a new Moto 360 will provide a very stock Wear OS experience, I think it's important for the brand to offer a more complete device package if it wants to stay competitive.  My Moto 360 perspective is entirely second-hand, as no one on staff has one anymore. But our original Moto 360 review gushed about its traditional round look at a time when the LG G Watch and Samsung Gear Live were square; this watch and the original Huawei Watch helped define \"round\" as the default Android watch look. It was far from perfect. It had a chin bezel for the ambient light sensor, a lower PPI than other watches at that time, battery life that required nightly charges \u2014 a full day wasn't a guarantee \u2014 and the limitations of early Wear software across brands. The 2nd-gen Moto 360 (2015) added a crown, slimmed down the bezel (though it kept the sensor chin), improved the battery life, and stuck to the style and sensors that stood out among Wear watches. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Then Motorola bowed out of the smartwatch game, licensing out the Moto 360 (3rd Gen) to be made by a company called eBuyNow. It had a thick steel design (see below) that didn't quite stand out among Wear OS watches the way its predecessors did. It relied heavily on Google Fit software and reportedly had poor battery life and connectivity issues.  I believe the biggest issues were outside of Motorola's control. It depended on Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear hardware and Google's Android Wear software, both of which had significant and documented issues in that early era. While I don't have any insider account on Motorola's Wear perspective, we know 2020 was around the time OnePlus's CEO said they tried to \"work with Google to try to improve\" Wear OS for \"better device interoperability\" between phones and watches, but it gave up and used a proprietary OS for the first OnePlus Watch. You also have Xiaomi trying out Android Wear on the Mi Watch in 2019, then leaving it behind until its Watch 2 Pro in 2023. The common thread is that Google's 2021 Wear OS partnership with Samsung \u2014 and much-improved Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 hardware \u2014 righted a sinking ship and brought OEMs back into the fold. But Motorola remains a missing link.  Out of the Android OEMs that made Wear watches but haven't used Wear OS 3+ \u2014 ASUS, Huawei, LG (RIP), Motorola, OPPO, and ZTE \u2014 Motorola feels like the most natural fit with unfinished Wear OS business. Parent company Lenovo owned a substantial 5% of the global 2024 smartphone market (per Canalys), while Motorola, Honor, and Huawei were the \"fastest-growing OEMs among all the top 10 brands\" in 2024 (per Counterpoint). Assuming Motorola phones aren't banned next month, they'll keep their substantial footprint. Foldables like the Razr Plus 2024 are catnip to Android power users, but I suspect they get most of their business from well-made budget phones like the Moto G Power 2025. Either way, these users are stuck choosing between Wear OS watches with exclusive features that won't work on Motorola phones, fitness watches without proper messaging, or cheap Moto Watch models that still rely on Google Fit and the most basic health tracking. Only one, the Moto Watch 120, has Bluetooth calling with no LTE and only supports a passthrough version of Google Assistant from your phone.  Moto 360 watches were held back by the crappy hardware of their time. Now, picture one with the new Snapdragon chip likely coming this year, enhanced with newer cores and AI capabilities, with battery life that consistently lasts a couple of days per charge. Then pair it with Wear OS 5 \u2014 since Google and Samsung will probably keep Wear OS 6 to themselves until 2026 \u2014 and give Motorola users access to proper wearable apps, with the rumored Gemini-on-Wear-OS update arriving soon after. And now that Masimo is handling biosensing tech for Wear OS, Motorola could dive right into the ecosystem with a higher standard of health tracking rather than having to play catch-up.  Most OEMs wouldn't be interested, but Motorola still relies on Google Fit for its RTOS watches, even though the API shuts down this year. I think if Motorola had the option to let Google handle the fitness software and could focus on wearable tricks, it would. As it is, Motorola is spending a lot of R&D toying with wearable phones like the ones above that are fun to try out but very impractical and not anything you'd call stylish. It's the exact opposite of the principle that defined the original Moto 360: stepping away from the squarish watches of the time and blending in with traditional accessories. Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, I'd be perfectly happy to see a budget Moto Wear OS watch. It could follow the template of the OnePlus Watch 2R and Galaxy Watch FE, cheap Android watches that would appeal to the same group that buys $200\u2013400 phones. In particular, the 2R has that multi-day battery life that practical Moto fans love. Motorola, give us a stock Moto Wear OS watch with Google software that unleashes more smarts, health insights, and fitness tools to Motorola users \u2014 and evokes a classic round watch look. Until we get more hybrid smartwatches, we need this brand to come back and fill Fossil's niche, bringing a little more style and class to Wear OS.

The 256GB version is also on sale at $845 down from $1,099. See 512GB MacBook Air at Amazon See 256GB MacBook Air at Amazon With 16GB of unified memory and 512GB of built-in storage and that red-hot M3 processor chip, the MacBook Air is an elite-level laptop for work or play. Released just over a year ago, it brings 18 hours of battery life to all of its considerable features, including an 8-core CPU, 10-core CPU, and the amazing Apple Intelligence tech that will help you do everything from write emails to search your files. The 2024 MacBook Air with the M3 chip cooks along at absurdly fast speeds, 1.6 times faster than the previous-gen M1 MacBook Air, which was no slouch in the speed department. That formidable processing power combines with two Thunderbolt ports for external monitors or portable hard drives for backing up your files. The M3 MacBook Air supports one external monitor with up to 6K resolution at 60Hz, or you can close the laptop lid and connect two external monitors with up to 5K resolution at 60Hz. Of course, the screen of the MacBook Air itself is a true work of art, as most Apple laptops are. It\u2019s Apple\u2019s famous Liquid Retina screen, which supports 1 billion colors and can shine as brightly as 500 nits at 2560 x 1664 resolution. Pair that gorgeous screen with the 1080p HD FaceTime camera, three microphones, and four speakers with Spatial Audio, and you\u2019ll quickly see why the 2024 M3 MacBook Air is one of the best laptops on the market for videoconferencing. If you\u2019re a streaming enthusiast or you just want to have some entertainment during a trip, the 2024 M3 MacBook Air should be at the top of your wish list. That beautiful Liquid Retina screen is perfect for movies or TV shows, and with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 connections, your entertainment will flow through that screen without lag, hiccups, or the dreaded spinning beachball icon. No matter how you decide to put the 2024 MacBook Air to work (or play), you won\u2019t have to keep your eye on that battery icon to make sure it\u2019s not about to conk out on you. This model of the MacBook Air has a robust 18-hour battery life, more than ample for a full day of activity. Amazon\u2019s Big Spring Sale is living up to its name with deals like $300 off the 2024 M3 MacBook Air, matching its all-time lowest price. You\u2019re just a click away from upgrading your laptop game for years to come.

Since Amazon\u2019s theme of the week is \u201cBig,\u201d as in Big Spring Sale, it\u2019s only fitting that one of their hot tech deals aims to bring big storage and big speed to your PC. Whether you\u2019re looking for a faster and more responsive work PC, glitch-free streaming, or a primo gaming experience without lag, replacing your internal hard drive with the 2TB Samsung 990 PRO Gen 4 solid-state drive for just $169 (down from $249) is a big win waiting to happen. Both 1TB ($99 down from $159!) and 4TB ($279 down from $464) are also on sale, almost 40% off. See 1TB internal SSD at Amazon See 2TB internal SSD at Amazon See 4TB internal SSD at Amazon This 40% off Big Spring Sale deal on a pro-level internal hard drive for your PC works out to be a massive savings, and an easy and economical way to upgrade your PC, laptop, or gaming rig. It\u2019s the fastest SSD in the Samsung stable, which is saying a lot considering Samsung\u2019s lofty status as the world\u2019s leading flash memory brand. If you\u2019re a PC gamer, this SSD is basically a built-in cheat code. The 990 PRO Gen 4 isn\u2019t just an upgrade over your existing internal hard drive, it\u2019s even a huge leap forward from its predecessor model, the highly rated 980 PRO. The 990 PRO is a full 50% improvement in performance over that previous-gen hard drive, and it\u2019s far more power-efficient, so all that speed and processing might is produced while using even less power. See 1TB internal SSD at Amazon See 2TB internal SSD at Amazon The Samsung 990 PRO is so powerful, in fact, that it reaches nearly the absolute max performance level of PCIe 4.0. What does that mean, exactly? Long story short, PCIe is the high-speed interface standard used to connect your SSD and other important items like your graphics card to the PC\u2019s motherboard. PCIe 4.0 is the newest and fastest standard, and the 990 PRO is potent enough to reach the highest speeds possible in PCIe 4.0. Gaming, video and photo editing, streaming, and data-intensive apps take to this SSD incredibly well. All that white-hot processing speed and power, however, does not result in a white-hot PC, which is good because excessive heat is the sworn enemy of the delicate inner workings of your computer. The Samsung 990 PRO comes equipped with smart thermal control in the form of a nickel-coated controller that keeps the temperature down and the fan noise to a minimum. If you want to check for yourself, just open up Samsung\u2019s Magician Software, which continuously monitors the drive\u2019s health and metrics while protecting your data and self-downloading and installing firmware updates for the 990 PRO. Grabbing the 2TB Samsung 990 PRO Gen 4 internal SSD while it\u2019s just $166 during Amazon\u2019s Big Spring Sale is like putting a massive-horsepower engine under the hood of your modest ride for a ridiculously low price. The gains in speed and overall performance you\u2019ll see in your laptop or gaming rig when you do this economical upgrade will shock you.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Business Insider Edition  Google employees recently got their new compensation packages, and some say they've once again seen smaller pay bumps.          The issue was raised in a company all-hands on Tuesday, according to a transcript of the meeting shared with Business Insider.               At Google's monthly TGIF (Thank God It's Friday) meetings, employees can submit questions and vote for the ones they want to ask the most. One of the top-voted questions this week asked why some employees had seen a decrease in their refreshed stock grants and overall compensation despite Google's recent strong financial performance.               John Casey, Google's vice president for global compensation and benefits, told employees that more than 80% of staff saw a year-on-year increase in their 2025 compensation. He added, however, that some Googlers in less technical roles in some locations received smaller equity packages this year to calibrate pay to local markets.               Google's compensation packages typically consist of a base salary, equity awards, and, in some cases, bonuses. The actual amount a Googler makes varies based on performance.               Casey said that Google wanted to pay employees who made an impact and that the compensation structure was set up to reward high performers.       BI previously reported\u00a0that many Googlers saw smaller compensation packages in 2024.               A Google spokesperson told BI that its 2025 compensation cycle was similar to last year's and that Google continued to align its pay to local markets overall.       Have something to share?

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Business Insider Edition  In talks to negotiate a cease-fire between Russia and Ukraine, President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are painting the prospect of a bright \u2014 and lucrative \u2014 future for US-Russia relations.          After their phone call last week, the White House said the two leaders discussed the \"enormous economic deals\" that could result from better US-Russia relations, with joint Arctic economic exploration, space projects, and mining all areas mentioned.               If the US lifts sanctions on Russia, its economy, the world's 11th largest, could again open up to American businesses and investors.               It's a prospect likely to appeal to Trump, a businessman known for his transactional approach to diplomacy who has also mused about his desire to win a Nobel Peace Prize.           US trade with Russia dropped sharply after Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with exports shrinking from $6.4 billion to $1.7 billion, while imports dropped to $14.4 billion, from almost double that.               However, some analysts warn that the deals Trump craves appear to be a long way off, and question the sincerity of Putin's overtures.               \"Putin is happy to talk up business opportunities with Trump because he knows that they are good buttons to press to distract the administration from Russia's immediate goals in Ukraine,\" John Lough, an associate fellow in the Russia & Eurasia Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London, told BI.               He said that Russia will use prolonged negotiations to try to pursue its objectives, such as making sure Ukraine doesn't get security guarantees from its Western allies.               Putin has reoriented the Russian economy over the last few years, with 8% of the country's GDP and 40% of government spending now tied to the military.               But cracks are emerging in an economy heavily propped up by the Kremlin's defense budget, with inflation and labor market shortages becoming increasingly problematic.               This means Putin may see benefits in the possibility of economic deals with Trump, particularly those that enable Russia to access the global financial system.               An end to or loosening of sanctions could see Russia open up to US investment and businesses, and also seek tech parts and other components vital to industries such as aviation or tech manufacturing.               In discussions in Saudi Arabia this week, US, Ukrainian, and Russian officials brokered a potential agreement to halt attacks in the Black Sea.               As part of this, the US said it had agreed to \"help restore Russia's access to the world market for agricultural and fertilizer exports, lower maritime insurance costs, and enhance access to ports and payment systems for such transactions.\"               The move signaled an openness to break Russia's isolation from the global economy.               Even so, Paul Cormarie, a policy analyst with Rand Europe, told BI that Putin would struggle to transition Russia away from its wartime economy.               \"As soon as the music stops, all the other factors aggravating Russia's economy will suddenly appear in the daylight,\" he told BI. \"So there will have to be some sizable transition from a wartime to a peacetime economy that will be difficult if there are no opportunities for growth other than defense equipment.\"               Putin has praised Trump for seeking peace in Ukraine. But he's also restated Russia's goals that Kyiv says amount to an erasure of Ukrainian sovereignty.               And despite attempts by the Trump administration to reset Russia-US relations, Lough said it's \"hard to say how sustainable this situation will be.\"               \"The Kremlin will remain suspicious of Washington's motives,\" he added.               Another serious obstacle to a proposed US-Russia economic bargain is China.               Trump has openly mused about pulling Russia away from China, which the Kremlin has relied on economically during the war. It's been a vital market for sanctioned Russian oil, and a source of consumer goods and tech \u2014 as well as diplomatic backing.               Putin and China's President Xi Jinping also share a long-term goal of overtaking US global power. Any moves by Russia to draw closer to the US are unlikely to be part of a long-term shift.               \"In Moscow, Trump is seen as an anomaly for the US establishment from whom it might be possible to extract some short-term gains,\" Temur Umarov, a fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, wrote in March.               But he's also seen as someone who \"it would be foolish to plan a long-term foreign policy shift\" around, Umarov said.               Lough agreed, adding \"Moscow is happily banking Trump's concessions on Ukraine but has no reason so far to believe that the US will cease to be a long-term challenge to Russian interests.\"               Ultimately, a major shift will have to go far beyond the level of words and discussions of potentially lucrative deals.               \"That point will only be reached if newly established dialogue leads to the conclusion of a range of agreements,\" said Lough, including in areas of arms controls mirroring those brokered toward the end of the Cold War.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) were down by around 6% during mid-day trading on Wednesday after a report that its business in China could be negatively impacted by new government rules. The stock traded around\u00a0$113.48 as of 3:20 p.m. New York Time. China\u2019s National Development and Reform Commission has asked firms in the country to use energy-efficient chips in new data centers and those that are being expanded, the Financial Times reported, citing documents reviewed by the publication.  The H20 chip, which was developed by Nvidia to comply with U.S. export controls, reportedly does not meet the new requirements introduced by the economic planning agency. Nvidia executives are reportedly seeking a meeting with Zheng Shanjie, the chair of the commission, to discuss the rules. It has also reportedly adjusted the chip to meet the energy efficiency rules. People told the Financial Times that companies such as Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY) have been advised by the commission to not buy the less-powerful Nvidia processors. However, the people said that H20 sales are not currently being impacted, because the rules have yet to be strictly enforced. Meanwhile, Chinese tech giants have reportedly increased orders for the H20 chips after Chinese AI startup DeepSeek sent shockwaves through the industry with its R1 reasoning models in January.  China and Hong Kong are the chipmaker\u2019s fourth-largest market, representing about 13% of its annual revenue \u2014 or $17.1 billion \u2014 for fiscal 2025, according to Nvidia\u2019s Form 10-K. \u201cOur products provide superb energy efficiency and value in every market we serve,\u201d Nvidia said in a statement to the Financial Times. \u201cAs technology moves rapidly, export control policy should be adjusted to allow U.S. firms to offer the most energy-efficient products possible, while still achieving the Administration\u2019s national security goals.\u201d Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Apple today announced the official release date of its iPhone 16 lineup in Indonesia, after the country lifted a ban on its sale following Apple's more than $300 million investment plan. The iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max, and iPhone 16e will launch in the Indonesian market on April 11. The announcement indicates that the iPhone 16 series has passed the Indonesian telecommunications equipment certification \u2013 the final hurdle in the approvals process. Previously, the iPhone 16 models also obtained the local component content (TKDN) certification issued by the Indonesian Ministry of Industry, with a standard rate of 40%, exceeding the current minimum requirement of 35%. Indonesia blocked iPhone 16 sales in October after determining that Apple had not met the country's 40% domestic content requirement for smartphones. Beyond the monetary investment, Apple has reportedly committed to training local talent in research and development, so that Indonesians can develop software and design their own products. The pledge addresses one of the government's key demands for Apple to establish R&D facilities in the country. The agreement also includes plans for a manufacturing plant on Batam island that will produce AirTags, Apple's device tracking accessories. This facility will be operated by Apple supplier Luxshare Precision Industry, and is expected to eventually account for 20% of global AirTag production. Another manufacturing facility is planned for Bandung, about three hours from Jakarta, which will produce other types of accessories. Part of the investment will also fund Apple academies to equip Indonesian students with tech skills like coding. Despite the substantial concessions, recent reports indicate that Apple has no immediate plans to manufacture iPhones in Indonesia. That means Apple remains the only brand in the country allowed to sell imported smartphones without local manufacturing. In contrast, other manufacturers must comply with TKDN regulations by producing devices locally or contributing through software development. Get weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Business Insider Edition  There are some unusual signs that could suggest we're headed into a recession. Take lipstick or diaper rashes, for instance.          While not as frequently cited as the bond market or household spending, some economists and executives have pointed to such informal indicators as signs that a downturn could be on the horizon.               Of course, nothing is certain. Some of these theories have obvious holes in them or might simply reflect a pullback in consumer spending \u2014 an ominous sign, but far from a guarantee that a recession is close.               That doesn't mean they're any less fascinating to examine.               Here are nine less conventional signs to watch.               There's some evidence that people buy fewer snacks \u2014 and other types of food \u2014 when a recession hits. One review of studies found that the Great Recession of 2008 reduced the consumption of snacks, as well as other foods from fast food to fresh produce.               Today, consumers are snacking less, and it may have to do with uncertainty about the future of the economy.               General Mills, the company that makes Chex Mix and Nature Valley granola bars, reported last week that its third-quarter net sales fell by 5%.               It wasn't just human snacks that took a hit, CEO Jeff Harmening said on the company's earnings call. General Mills' sales of pet snacks were also down, he told analysts.               \"Our view is that a lot of that has to do with consumer confidence,\" Harmening said.               Another theory is that shoppers cut back on alcohol purchases when they're concerned about finances and the economy. Instead of buying full bottles of booze, drinkers go for the small ones you'd find on airplanes or in hotel minibars.               Brown-Forman, the company behind Jack Daniels whiskey and Herradura tequila, has said that consumers are buying more small bottles lately.               \"The reason small sizes are doing well is more because of the cyclical inflation and it's a consumer that's pinched,\" CEO Lawson Whiting said during an earnings call earlier this month.               The creation of the lipstick index is widely attributed to Leonard Lauder, one of the billionaire heirs to the Este Lauder cosmetics fortune.               Back in 2001, when the US economy was in the throes of a recession, Lauder noticed that lipstick sales were actually rising, not falling. Lauder's theory was that lipstick sales and the health of the economy were in inverse proportion to one another \u2014 essentially, as the economy got worse, lipstick sales got better \u2014 because consumers considered lipstick an \"affordable luxury.\"               Lipstick sales at mass retailers were up 11% back when Lauder invented the index. Some of the world's biggest cosmetics brands reported a sales boost in 2008 as the US headed into a recession. And more recently, beauty sales have boomed as inflation has remained high over the past several months.               Still, lipstick probably isn't a reliable recession indicator \u2014 there are plenty of times when cosmetics sales have boomed during times of relative economic prosperity \u2014 and dipped during downturns.               The former Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan popularized the \"men's underwear index,\" which posits that when the economy is in decline, men will stop buying new underwear since it's a garment most people won't see on a daily basis. When the economic outlook improves, they'll start replacing their boxers or briefs again.               It's not foolproof, but there are instances where Greenspan's theory was correct. Men's underwear sales dipped in 2008 and 2009, during the Great Recession, and rose between 2010 and 2015, Euromonitor data found. US sales of men's underwear also dipped dramatically in 2020 amid the uncertainty of the pandemic before rebounding in 2021, Bloomberg data found.               Developed in the 1920s, the hemline index asserts that skirts and dresses get shorter when the economy is doing well and longer during a downturn.               While it might not be a reliable indicator, there are some recent examples.               The miniskirt became trendy in the 1960s when the economy was booming, but when the oil crisis hit in the 1970s, skirts got longer again, as Bloomberg reported. And in early 2022, the ultra-miniskirt, also called the micromini, was the \"it\" item before inflation rose and the ankle-length maxi skirt came into vogue.               The thinking goes that cardboard boxes can act as a barometer for the health of the economy since they play such a crucial role in transporting goods \u2014 not just to consumers who buy things online, but to stores and warehouses that receive those goods in bulk.               So, if demand for cardboard is slowing, it could mean consumers are buying less stuff.               This indicator may be more accurate than some of the others, as there's a direct correlation between cardboard demand and consumer purchasing. Back in early 2009, as the US was in the midst of a recession, cardboard shipments declined drastically and US cardboard manufacturers' operating rates dipped as well. A similar trend arose in early 2023: The Fibre Box Association, a trade group that represents the industry, reported that cardboard shipments had fallen 8.4% in the fourth quarter of 2022, the steepest decline since the financial crisis.               Diapering a baby is a costly endeavor for parents \u2014 to the tune of $500 to $900 annually \u2014 and during economic hard times, some parents may be forced to ration diapers to save money.               But when you change a baby's diaper less frequently, there's a higher chance the baby will develop diaper rash, leading to increased sales of ointment to treat it. Thus, lower diaper sales and higher ointment sales might serve as a clue that the economy is contracting.               There are examples of this indicator coming into play during periods of belt-tightening. The trend began during tough economic times in 2011, when parents cut back on buying diapers or traded down to cheaper brands at the same time that ointment sales rose 8%, The Wall Street Journal reported at the time.               But the index isn't airtight: Around the same time, the birth rate was declining, while diaper technology had improved so parents could more easily tell if a diaper was wet, and parents began potty training earlier in an effort to cut costs, the Journal reported.               The Champagne index is basically the inverse of the lipstick index: When the economy is bad, people will stop buying pricey Champagne and opt for cheaper alcohol instead.               It's played out before. Before the 2008 recession, US sales of Champagne surpassed 23 million bottles, but by 2009, that number had dipped to 12.5 million, according to an article in UC Berkeley's Business Review.               The index may be tied to societal sentiment more broadly since fewer celebrations mean fewer occasions for bubbly. Indeed, Champagne sales dropped 18% by volume in 2020, CIVC, a Champagne industry trade group, reported at the time. Then, in 2021, as travel and socializing began to resume, sales of Champagne reached a record high of $5.7 billion, 14% higher than the pre-pandemic record.               Exotic dancers are often among the first group of people to warn of a coming recession, Aaliyah Kissick, the CEO of Financial Literacy Diaries and a Gen Z money expert, told BI last year. That lends credence to another predictive theory: the stripper index.           Kissick pointed to strippers' tips as a microcosm for elastic goods. The elasticity of a product refers to how changing prices may or may not trigger changing demand.               Coffee, for example, is an inelastic good. Even as prices rise, people continue to buy it because they just aren't willing to go without it. The fact that caffeine can be an addictive substance means people won't pull back on their coffee consumption even in tough economic times.               But whereas a typical white-collar worker isn't willing to forgo coffee during a recession, he may be more likely to ditch the after-hours entertainment or tip performers less, Kissick said.               The theory could be more broadly applied to any service industry worker who relies on tips, Peter C. Earle, a senior economist at the American Institute for Economic Research, told BI last year.               \"As a lot of people in the food service industry have noticed lately, a decrease in restaurant tipping suggests that consumers are reducing discretionary spending \u2014 whether because of rising unemployment, the debilitating effect of inflation, or both,\" he said.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"        Danielle Kurtzleben                         President Trump announces tariffs on auto imports in the Oval Office on Wednesday.                                                           Mandel Ngan\/AFP                                       hide caption  President Trump said on Wednesday that he will impose 25% tariffs on imported cars and car parts starting next week, using his national security powers to take the action. \"I think our automobile business will flourish like it's never flourished before,\" Trump said in remarks from the Oval Office. The United Auto Workers union praised the move, saying it could mean more shifts for workers at plants with spare capacity. The latest policy is yet another example of the president's tariff-centric second-term economic agenda. Thus far, Trump has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, steel and aluminum, and some goods from Canada and Mexico. Mexico is by far the largest exporter of auto parts to the U.S., followed by Canada, China, Japan, and South Korea, according to Commerce Department data. The list of the biggest vehicle exporters is similar: Mexico far outstrips other countries, followed by Japan, South Korea, Canada, and Germany. The tariffs under the USMCA, a trade agreement ratified during Trump's first term, would be more complicated. Cars imported under the USMCA will be tariffed only on their non-U.S. content, the White House said. In addition, the administration is still deciding how to tariff auto parts imported under the USMCA, an administration official told reporters. The tariffs not only on cars but car parts could have complex effects on the automobile supply chain. As NPR has reported, car parts can cross borders multiple times as a car is assembled. Auto industry analysts told NPR earlier this month that they expect these tariffs to raise car prices for U.S. consumers.  Foreign automakers blasted the new tariffs. \"The tariffs imposed today will make it more expensive to produce and sell cars in the United States, ultimately leading to higher prices, fewer options for consumers, and fewer manufacturing jobs in the U.S.,\" said Jennifer Safavian, CEO of Autos Drive America, a group that represents companies including BMW, Hyundai, and Toyota. Trump also plans a wave of what he calls \"reciprocal tariffs\" to be announced on April 2, which he has called Liberation Day. The taxes on imports have caused plummeting stock markets and consumer confidence, and have left businesses and consumers uncertain about what they want to invest in. The Trump administration has given multiple rationales for these tariffs, but it has emphasized boosting manufacturing as the chief goal. U.S. tariffs are paid to the government by businesses in the U.S. that are importing goods. Studies of tariffs imposed in Trump's first term have shown they were overwhelmingly paid by U.S. businesses and consumers. White House officials have said that foreign companies will lower their prices to compensate for tariffs, essentially eating the cost. However, when asked by NPR, the officials provided no data to support this. Trump's tariff policy has been chaotic throughout this presidency. In addition to the tariffs already imposed, he has threatened still more tariffs on a range of goods from around the world, at times announcing a tariff only to then delay or retract it. This week, Trump floated what he called a \"secondary tariff\" of 25% on goods from any country buying oil or gas from Venezuela. The White House has given few specific details on what to expect next week when Trump announces reciprocal tariffs \u2014 though Trump said on Wednesday that they would be more \"lenient\" and \"conservative\" than some might expect.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Business Insider Edition  Labubu, the doll with serrated teeth that has Asia in a chokehold, made its producer a lot of money in 2024.          On Wednesday, the Chinese toymaker Pop Mart, known for selling collectible \"blind boxes\" of mystery toys and figurines, reported annual sales growth of 107% in 2024 compared with the year before.               It made 13.04 billion yuan, or $1.8 billion, in revenue, and its profits rose 204% from the previous year.               The Monsters toy line, which Labubu is part of, was particularly lucrative for the company. Its sales totaled 3.04 billion yuan, or 23% of Pop Mart's total revenue.               \"THE MONSTERS has rapidly gained global popularity and earned widespread fan support worldwide, achieving a significant year-on-year growth of 726.6% in related revenue,\" the company said in its earnings report.               Pop Mart, which is publicly listed in Hong Kong, saw its stock price rise about 11% to 141 Hong Kong dollars, or $18, when markets closed Wednesday. It's up almost 400% compared with a year ago.               Retail analysts speaking with Business Insider in November attributed Labubu's popularity to several factors, including celebrity endorsement.               In April, Lisa, one of the four singers from the hit K-pop band Blackpink,\u00a0posted\u00a0a Labubu on her Instagram, which set off the craze for the product.               \"I think the raging popularity of Labubu lies in its unique designs, emotional connection, exclusivity, and association with Lisa,\" Sory Park, a project manager at the Chinese consumer research firm Daxue Consulting, told BI.               Products in the Monsters collection in the US range from $9 for a 2-inch badge to $180 for its 23-inch plush toy.               The toymaker's footprint is largely concentrated in China \u2014 it had 401 physical stores and 2,190 \"roboshops,\" or vending machines, in China at the end of 2024. Internationally, it had 130 outlets, with new shops opening in Italy, Spain, the UK, and the US.               Representatives for Pop Mart did not respond to a request for comment.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Editorial Fellow Customers shop at the flagship Pop Mart store in Shanghai on Jan. 23, 2025. Editorial Fellow For years, products stamped with a \u201cMade in China\u201d label have been associated with kitschiness, mass production, and poor quality, in part because global demand for cheap generic products turned China into a factory for the world.\u00a0 But for Claire Carrillo, one Chinese branded product is worth travelling distances, waiting hours in lines, and breaking open her wallet for. \u201cIt\u2019s something that makes me happy, like it\u2019s a treat to myself,\u201d the 24-year-old digital marketing consultant from the Philippines tells TIME of Pop Mart\u2019s CryBaby toy\u2014a plush genderless creature with puffy red cheeks, furrowed brows, and welled-up tears around its eyes. Advertisement Advertisement Since discovering Chinese toy company Pop Mart a year ago, Carrillo has bought nearly 100 of its products, many of which she gives as gifts to friends and family. Her love for the brand has sent her on a hunt for its characters, including travelling to Singapore for just 24 hours in hopes of finding a limited edition or waiting four hours in the rain in Taiwan just to come away with one collectible. And Carrillo isn\u2019t alone. A search of \u201cPop Mart\u201d on TikTok renders hundreds of thousands of hauls and unboxing videos. Fans have flocked overseas to look for sold out or exclusive products at different Pop Mart stores, roboshops (vending machines), or pop-ups; and groups on Facebook and WeChat trade updates on when the brand comes out with new lines or restocks its products. That virality has translated into a recent boom for the company, which was founded by 38-year-old entrepreneur and now-billionaire Wang Ning in 2010: last year its shares shot up by almost 370%, ahead of most members on the MSCI China Index. In mainland China alone, Pop Mart has over 46 million members, consumers who sign up to collect points for purchases, as of December 2024, and even opened Pop Land, an amusement park spanning 40,000 square meters in Beijing, in September 2023. But it\u2019s outside China where Pop Mart is really taking off. Over 130 of the company\u2019s more than 530 stores worldwide as well as over 190 of more than 2,490 roboshops, as of December 2024, are located outside mainland China, and its non-mainland revenue grew by 375% to 5 billion yuan (about $700 million) in 2024, accounting for nearly 40% of its approximately $1.8 billion total revenue, according to the company\u2019s 2024 annual report, which was released on Wednesday. Some might say Pop Mart is riding a wave. One could argue, however, that it is making the wave. While the rest of China\u2019s economy slowed and youth unemployment spiked last year, its guzi\u2014goods, specifically character-based merchandise and collectible toys\u2014market continued to soar, with Pop Mart leading the way. China\u2019s designer toy industry is projected to reach more than 110 billion yuan, or US$15 billion, in retail sales in 2026\u2014more than 1500% increase from 2015, when retail sales were just US$890 million. Worldwide, the toy and figurine market is projected to reach a market value of $49 billion by 2034, up from $26 billion last year. \u201cI go Pop Mart everywhere,\u201d Lisa, the mega famous Thai actress-singer and member of K-pop group Blackpink, told Vanity Fair in a \u201cmy secret obsession\u201d video in November. \u201cIf I fly to New York, I go to Miami, I try to find Pop Mart there, Paris, you know, everywhere. Kind of like a treasure, finding treasure.\u201d Here\u2019s what to know about how Pop Mart took over the world. Where Pop Mart distinguishes itself from both domestic and international competitors is in reading the mood of its consumers, Ashley Dudarenok, who runs a China and Hong Kong-based consumer research consultancy, tells TIME. Whether it\u2019s rebelliousness, a desire to escape, or exhaustion from work or school, Pop Mart customers are buying more than just a toy, they\u2019re buying a symbol of themselves. They\u2019re often essentially useless, says scholar Erica Kanesaka, an assistant professor of English at Emory University specializing in the politics of cuteness in Asian American literature, but they \u201cadd a sense of vibrancy and imagination to our mundane activities and environments.\u201d Relatability seems to be a big part of cultivating fandoms for different characters. Carillo says she is drawn to the CryBaby series because she thinks of herself as a cry baby. Ashley Jane Leow, a 25-year-old filmmaker in Singapore, collects figurines of Hirono, an angsty-looking boy with tousled hair, and Nyota, an introverted girl with wide eyes and short bangs, because they remind her of herself and her boyfriend. \u201cIt got so bad that I was dreaming about it at one point,\u201d Leow tells TIME. Pop Mart\u2019s strengths fit into a broader client-centric marketing model several Chinese brands have begun to adopt that incorporates client psychology and storytelling. \u201cWhat truly matters is how a brand makes clients feel,\u201d luxury brand strategy expert Daniel Langer wrote in Jing Daily last August. Creating a following for a brand typically used to rely on products being a status symbol, such as designer handbags. But the proliferation of cheaper \u201cdupes\u201d made easily available on Amazon, TikTok Shop, and Shein have taken some of the allure away from such products. Increasingly, Langer observed, many of the rising Chinese luxury brands that are now excelling globally have moved away from a traditional 4P model (Product, Price, Place, Promotion) to a 4E model (Experience, Exclusivity, Engagement, and Emotion). While Pop Mart doesn\u2019t market itself as a luxury brand, it resembles one for a new generation of consumers, and its prices range from US$5 for a small accessory to more than US$1,500 for a 30-inch figurine, while it\u2019s even made a foray into jewellery. To stand out in an international market, Pop Mart is pushing art and innovation to the forefront of its public image, Eva Zhao, the head of international marketing at Pop Mart, tells TIME. By platforming its individual designers and artists hailing from around the world, the company creates a sense of individuality in its products, a far cry from the stereotypes of mass production and copycat products often applied to Chinese brands. That also means it can partner with legacy brands that would otherwise be competitors, like Disney and Sanrio, for toys of their characters in Pop Mart\u2019s unique style and with artists in different countries whose art might have wider appeal to customers overseas, Zhao said. Labubu, a Nordic monkey-like forest elf with a devilish grin designed by Netherlands-based artist Kasing Lung, went viral outside of China last year for being \u201cugly-cute\u201d\u2014but it isn\u2019t Pop Mart\u2019s most popular character in mainland China (that\u2019s Molly, a little girl with cat-like emerald eyes and a distinct pout designed by Hong Kong-based artist Kenny Wong). Instead, Labubu is Pop Mart\u2019s bestselling IP globally\u2014in part fueled by Lisa, who posted an Instagram story to her more than 100 million followers last April hugging a giant Labubu plush toy and with a Labubu bag charm. In 2024, The Monsters IP (which includes Labubu) generated 3 billion yuan (US$419 million) in revenue\u2014a year-on-year growth of 726.6% in related revenue, according to the annual report. Pop Mart shares the biographies of its artists on its website or social media and posts background stories and additional content for characters to try to foster deeper connection with consumers. For example, Los-Angeles based artist Libby Frame who designed Pop Mart\u2019s Peach Riot, a punky fictional three-member girl band, also creates songs for the band. The emphasis on the artists behind each character resonates with Leow. On a visit to the Pop Mart store in Taipei, Leow was struck by the fact that an entire floor had been turned into an exhibition of the art behind one of Pop Mart\u2019s figurines, Pucky\u2014a stubby, chubby sprite named after Puck from Shakespeare\u2019s A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. \u201cI was like, you know what?,\u201d recounts Leow, \u201cSupport an artist, I see the vision, so I bought it.\u201d While Pop Mart sells large busts, figurines, and accessories, their toys most commonly come in a \u201cblind box\u201d format. Pop Mart\u2019s blind boxes are themed by character and series, but similar to Gashapon machines in Japan (which churn out a surprise toy inside a capsule), exactly which toy you\u2019ll get is a mystery when you buy it. #unboxing time! \u2728\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb \u2014 #popmart #crybaby #fyp #foryou #relatable  Japan has long dominated the global \u201ccute\u201d market, going as far back as the late nineteenth century when Japan was a major exporter of children\u2019s toys, says Kanesaka. That was cemented by the \u201cexplosion\u201d of kawaii (Japanese for \u201ccute\u201d) culture in the second half of the twentieth century\u2014reinforced by the \u201cCool Japan\u201d campaign, a deliberate effort by the Japanese government to promote Japanese popular culture overseas. Hello Kitty, Pikachu, Kirby, and many other kawaii characters are \u201cnow firmly embedded in the global culture,\u201d says Kanesaka, the Emory professor. Dreams Inc., a Japanese company, makes blind box Sonny Angels and Smiskis, which are also incredibly popular worldwide, with sales last year three to four times higher than in 2022. But Kanesaka doesn\u2019t find it unusual that a Chinese company can also now break into that market. Online shopping and social media have \u201copened up the flow of information about [Chinese] goods and about the racialized logics that attach China to counterfeits and second-rate products that are merely derivative,\u201d she says. Dudarenok, the consumer research consultant, sees Pop Mart\u2019s global success as more than just an ebbing of stigma against Chinese manufacturing; instead it\u2019s a direct result of the company\u2019s ability to navigate and succeed in the Chinese market. \u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise that this kind of company comes out of China,\u201d says Dudarenok. That\u2019s because \u201cChina is the world\u2019s most competitive digital market, with maybe the most spoiled consumer in the world that wants things fast, cheap, and good.\u201d Pop Mart understands those consumer needs, according to Dudarenok, and the Chinese domestic market lets companies \u201cfail fast and succeed fast\u201d to figure out what consumers really want. One way Pop Mart distinguishes itself from Japanese competitors is through its stores. By contrast, Dreams Inc. largely sells its toys online or through distributors like Kiddy Land, Kinokuniya, and Urban Outfitters. Pop Mart, on the other hand, turns its own stores into an experience\u2014with each modeled after one of its characters\u2014fuelling customers like Carillo and Leow to plan travels around visiting different Pop Mart stores. They\u2019ve also capitalized on the blind box craze through their roboshops vending machines that make buying their blind boxes all the more accessible. For some, the model has actually generated interest in visiting China\u2014just to visit the various Pop Mart stores and attractions there. After visiting Pop Mart stores in London, Tokyo, Singapore, and Melbourne, Samantha Todd, a 30-year-old content creator from North Brisbane, Australia, now has her sights set on the global flagship store in Shanghai, which spans more than 500 square meters with two floors and 10 rooms designed to look like a futuristic spaceship. It\u2019s a trip she never thought of making before discovering Pop Mart. Todd is one person who has found social media fame through unboxing her blind box toys. Todd discovered Pop Mart last year after posting a TikTok about how she didn\u2019t get the allure of Sonny Angels. Her followers suggested she look at Pop Mart instead, and she \u201cjust fell in love.\u201d Todd has since amassed dozens of Pop Mart toys\u2014many of whom accompany her on her overseas travels in a large brown knapsack\u2014and nearly 250,000 followers who watch her unbox her toys and visit stores in search of limited editions. One video posted in January this year chronicles her weeklong quest to get a specific Labubu from a Pop Mart vending machine, even skipping her gym classes to be first in line. It raked in more than two million views and 200,000 likes. \u201cChoosing labubu over gym is totally something I would do too,\u201d one commenter wrote. \u201cDon't know what a labubu is Or a pop mart Or the strength it requires to go to the gym more than once a year. But I'm invested,\u201d another wrote. Other commenters said they couldn\u2019t wait to see her unbox the toys, or they wished there was a Pop Mart near them, while others still said the video had inspired them to begin their own \u201cLabubu journey.\u201d The blind box format lends itself to unboxing videos in large part because creators and viewers share in the feeling of rooting for a certain item and reacting to what they find\u2014unlike other social media shopping haul videos, the creator doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re getting, making the unboxing a kind of game or gamble as much as it is showing viewers the product, and potentially spurring viewers to buy their own and take a chance on getting the character they want. And the elements of surprise and collecting inherent to blind box toys \u201cprovide a small way to introduce magic into the ordinary and to find community through sharing, trading, and displaying them with other people,\u201d particularly at a time when many might feel disconnected or alienated by hyper-digitalization, says Kanesaka. That\u2019s exactly what draws 26-year-old Amanda Lee, who works in digital marketing in Singapore, to Pop Mart. When Pop Mart started trending in Singapore last year, where the company has 10 stores, Lee and her colleagues decided to open CryBaby Powerpuff Girls blind boxes together in the middle of the workday. Since then, they\u2019ve made it a frequent lunchtime habit, typically all buying blind boxes from the same character line and occasionally bringing back blind boxes from one of their trips overseas to open together. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fun little thing that we get to do together during our lunch breaks to relieve some stress,\u201d she tells TIME. On her desk sits a CryBaby called \u201cStarboy,\u201d which has a turquoise ombr\u00e9 head capped with a matching party hat, a translucent blue body with mini baubles inside and a star on its chest, and glittery tears welling up in its eyes. Because of the element of mystery, the blind boxes have a similar allure to gambling, so much so that China regulates sales of blind boxes to children. But there\u2019s no risk, like gambling, says Dudarenok. You\u2019re guaranteed to get something cute for a relatively affordable price, she tells TIME: \u201cIt\u2019s happiness in a box.\u201d \u00a9 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

The prices of the best graphics cards are through the roof, and frankly, even the worst GPUs we\u2019ve seen in the last few years are expensive. Every single card from the current generation is selling well above the recommended list price (MSRP), and unfortunately, what little remains of the previous gens is pricey, too. If you\u2019re struggling to\u00a0buy a GPU right now, I can relate. I\u2019ve been through this myself in the last cryptocurrency mining-fueled GPU shortage when my old GTX 1060 was on its last legs and I was desperate to snag a new card. Here\u2019s what\u2019s happening right now and what you can do to still buy a graphics card right now. Tom\u2019s Hardware compiled a comprehensive report on the current state of GPU pricing, covering both this generation and the previous one. The report includes AMD, Intel, and Nvidia, so it gives us a solid look at the current state of things. Long story short: It\u2019s not good. Across the board, current-gen graphics cards are selling well above their MSRPs. This is true even for smaller players and more budget cards, like the Arc B580. Intel received a lot of praise for the card upon launch, because its performance per dollar was truly excellent \u2014 but it\u2019s a whole different story now that the GPU costs $396 instead of $250. Of course, the situation with Nvidia GPUs is quite dire, as highlighted in the report. The cheapest RTX 5090 that the publication was able to find costs a whopping $3,999, which is literally twice the amount of money we were supposed to have to pay for it. Finding it in stock is another issue. Even AMD, which heavily emphasized offering GPUs for the mainstream market (which, according to AMD, means prices below $700), is struggling to supply cards at MSRP. The cheapest RX 9070 XT on Amazon currently costs $940, which is a whopping $340 above MSRP. Tom\u2019s Hardware also scoured eBay, as that\u2019s a better source of GPUs these days when retailers offer little more than empty shelves. The 30-day eBay sale average for the RTX 5090 sits at a staggering $4,222 \u2026 so while those GPUs are available, they cost a fortune. Shopping last-gen is not a solution here, at least not often. Only a select few cards are selling near their MSRP. Most cards are selling for more, with GPUs priced at anywhere from 3% to 111% above their MSRP; on average, eBay GPUs cost 24% more than the recommended list price. Things are looking bleak, but not entirely hopeless. If I were to buy a GPU right now, here\u2019s what I\u2019d try to do. I\u2019m not usually a big fan of buying used GPUs, but the truth is that right now, it\u2019s a better option than many others. Obviously, this will not get you a current-gen card, as those are only a couple of months old right now \u2014 but you should be able to find plenty of RTX 40-series and RX 7000 GPUs for sale on the second-hand market, not to mention even older cards. People who have the funds or the drive to buy a current-gen GPU will try to sell off their GPUs to make some of that money back first, so you might be able to score a decent deal. Check local marketplaces or eBay for these, but be careful \u2014 there are lots of scammers online. Massive retailers and e-tailers are an obvious choice when you want to buy a GPU, but they\u2019re not the only option. While waiting for restocks at Best Buy is a legitimate strategy, those GPUs will be snapped up in no time. Instead, you might be better off checking a local store and trying to come to some sort of an understanding. Smaller retailers will often add a premium on the GPU, but it\u2019ll still be less than scalper prices. If you know of a local store, ask about waiting lists and things like that \u2014 being patient might net you a GPU. Few places guarantee cards at MSRP, but some of them do. Nvidia, for example, will sell its own Founders Edition cards at MSRP, so that\u2019s a good option. In general, FE cards are pretty much the only safe bet when it comes to buying at MSRP right now. AMD hasn\u2019t made its own versions of the RX 9070 XT (also known as Made By AMD, or MBA), so the prices of those GPUs are up to AMD\u2019s partners. Nvidia\u2019s own GPUs are locked to MSRP until that\u2019s officially raised. As mentioned above, eBay\u00a0can be a source of GPUs \u2014 but they\u2019re expensive. Retailers are largely sold out outside of restocks here and there, and those cards later end up on eBay (thanks, scalpers). If you\u2019ve got the money to spare and don\u2019t mind paying extra, eBay is probably the fastest option, but keep in mind that there are a lot of scams, too. I\u2019ve seen things like a $6,000 printed photo of the RTX 5090 being sold, or listings where the cards will ship in two to four weeks. Steer clear of those, and if something doesn\u2019t look right, avoid that listing. Buying last-gen cards is usually a good strategy in situations like this, but not this time. Both AMD and Nvidia appear to have ceased producing last-gen cards at just the right time for the market to start drying up. The vast majority of Nvidia\u2019s RTX 40-series is selling above MSRP, with the RTX 4060 and the RTX 4060 Ti being the only options that are somewhat close to it. AMD has a few cards close to MSRP, such as the RX 7600 or the RX 7800 XT. Again, this isn\u2019t my favorite solution, but it works. In times of GPU shortages, system manufacturers (OEMs) get some kind of supply of GPUs independently of the rest of the market. As a result, you\u2019ll find prebuilts with the RTX 5090 or the RX 9070 XT readily available, even if the prices might be high. From that point on, you can either just use the GPU and sell the rest of the parts or use the whole PC as is. If a GPU is yet to be announced, can we consider it to be delayed? Maybe, maybe not, but if you trust leakers, Nvidia's upcoming best graphics cards for gamers on a budget are seemingly stuck in limbo. The RTX 5060 and the RTX 5060 Ti are said to be delayed once again, and gamers might have to wait for quite a long time to get their hands on one of the new RTX 50-series GPUs. This grim update comes from Board Channels, which is a website frequented by people who claim to be affiliated with Nvidia's add-in board (AIB) partners. According to the report, the RTX 5060 Ti (in both its iterations, meaning the 8GB and the 16GB models) will now launch in mid-April, followed by the RTX 5060 in mid-May. Nvidia is said to have notified its AIBs about these delays. AMD's RX 9000 series quickly joined the ranks of the best graphics cards, and it appears that its success came as a surprise to everyone -- yes, even AMD itself. At a recent roundtable in Japan, the company revealed that its market share skyrocketed recently, reaching a whopping 45% in Japan. Although this refers to Japan, it's easy to imagine that AMD is gaining on Nvidia globally, too, although there are a few things to consider here. AMD's Yoshiaki Sato and Saki Suzuki shared a couple of updates during a Team AMD Roundtable held in Japan, which was later shared by ASCII. AMD was joined on stage by representatives of its many board partners, including ASRock, Asus, Gigabyte, MSI, PowerColor, and Sapphire. AMD's add-in board partners (AIBs) reportedly shared that they wanted to make and sell more Radeon graphics cards, but were being held back due to a lack of GPUs. To this, AMD's Sato replied: \"AMD isn't used to selling [this many] graphics cards.\" Nvidia is soon set to expand the list of its best graphics cards, and the first price leaks are already here. Although the company is still yet to announce the RTX 5060 Ti and the RTX 5060, someone spotted those cards listed for sale at a Chinese retailer. Their prices are staggering, but there's one spec update that I really hope turns out to be true. Before we dive in, obligatory disclaimer: All of the following is just a rumor right now. Someone sent an anonymous tip to VideoCardz with a screenshot from said retailer, but we haven't been able to verify this ourselves, so keep that in mind.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"There has been some unease in Labour's ranks over the planned savings in the welfare budget. The government's newly published assessment of the impact of the changes has increased that anxiety. The contents \u2013 with its estimates of increased poverty levels - show that talk of difficult decisions is not mere ministerial sloganeering. While polls suggest tackling the benefits bill is popular, voters and Labour MPs tend to be more squeamish when cuts affect disabled people. The scale of those cuts has led some Labour MPs publicly to declare for the first time today that they won't vote for the welfare changes \u2013 though any rebellion is ultimately likely to be unsuccessful. Perhaps of greater concern to Chancellor Rachel Reeves is that MPs on her own side are openly challenging her approach,  and putting forward alternatives. Those around the chancellor had believed that any argument over her iron-clad fiscal rules on debt and borrowing had been won well before polling day. Many of the new MPs were regarded as leadership loyalists, and it was assumed that they bought the argument that Labour had to kill off any impression that it would tax too highly and spend too much. It was also assumed they were aware that any major change to rules on borrowing and debt would invite unflattering comparisons with the short-lived regime of former prime minister Liz Truss. But some Labour MPs are finding an increasing number of difficult decisions are, well \u2013 increasingly difficult.  In the Commons on Wednesday,  the Labour chair of the cross-party work and pensions committee, Debbie Abrahams, supported moves to get people back into work. But she suggested that some of the changes to benefit levels would undermine rather than bolster elusive growth. She asked bluntly:  \"How will making people sicker and poorer help in driving our economy up?\" And left-wing MPs are publicly promoting alternatives. Bradford MP Imran Hussain called for a wealth tax and former frontbencher Andy McDonald demanded a hike in capital gains tax. Big Labour-supporting unions such as Unite take a similar view. Privately an MP regarded as being on the right of the party is advocating a temporary tax on wealth until the economy picks up. And a prominent Labour backbencher \u2013 who chaired a cross-party committee \u2013 had a range of possible options for bringing in more revenue. They included a council tax revaluation; less pensions tax relief for the better off;  a land tax; a new tax on property owners and not tenants. That backbench MP was none other than Rachel Reeves herself \u2013 in The Everyday Economy, a pamphlet she penned in 2018. Think tanks - such as the centrist Social Market Foundation \u2013 have also pushed alternative options such as cancelling the Lower Thames Crossing, taxing empty property, and taking another look at the triple lock, which can lead to inflation-busting increases in state pensions. But as well as ignoring her younger self,  the current debate the chancellor would really like to extinguish is whether to change - or bypass - her fiscal rules. These can lead to a spending squeeze in order to convince the Office for Budget Responsibility she's on course to have debt falling and day-to-day spending in balance by the end of the Parliament. What ignited - or at least re-ignited - the debate was the decision of the German parliament to exempt defence and infrastructure investment from their equivalent rules. So it's no longer just those on Labour's left who are calling for more flexibility. Some serving ministers privately believe that if \u2013 as the chancellor says \u2013 \"the world has changed\", then her rules can change with it. One of former prime minister Tony Blair's closest former advisers \u2013 John McTernan \u2013 has advocated an exemption for defence in the New Statesman. The Fabian Society \u2013 a think tank affiliated to Labour \u2013 has said that if the UK faces further fiscal pressure, the government must look again \"at how it can raise revenue progressively to protect our public services and support the vulnerable\". Rachel Reeves made it clear in her Spring Statement that her rules \u2013 which she tweaked at the Budget \u2013 were \"non-negotiable\". And the Treasury insists that following Germany's lead would push up the cost of borrowing \u2013 and therefore mortgages \u2013 even further. The chancellor has insisted that to ensure economic stability, there is no alternative to her approach. With fears that stubbornly sluggish growth will lead to more difficult decisions at the autumn Budget, some voices on the left and centre-left are now begging to differ. Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Business Insider Edition  Recession fears, DOGE cuts, broad layoffs \u2014 It's a tough time to be looking for a job.          But it's definitely not impossible, and there are certain steps you can take to make sure your next job is more resilient to volatile economic conditions, according to career coach Marnie Lemonik.               Big companies like Meta and Blackrock have announced plans to cut down their workforce numbers this year. Unemployment has ticked up slightly from 3.9% a year ago to 4.1% now. And while DOGE layoffs didn't lead to a spike in unemployment claims in February, they could start showing up in next month's data, according to Shruti Mishra, an economist at Bank of America. Uncertainty around DOGE and tariffs could also lead some employers to pause hiring, Mishra added.               The choppy economic environment doesn't paint a rosy picture for those who are looking for a new job. However, it hasn't deterred some people \u2014 namely, Gen Z workers. In fact, the prevalence of layoffs might further incentivize some workers to start recruiting.               \"The sentiment that I'm hearing from clients is 'I don't really feel a lot of stability,' and so that loyalty to a company for any given amount of time or reason is just less relevant because no one feels like they're getting that loyalty from the employer side,\" Lemonik said.               Here's the advice Lemonik gives her clients who are looking for jobs right now.               Lemonik's clients are exercising more caution in today's job market than they did in previous years.               Last year, it wasn't uncommon for Lemonik to see burnt-out clients quit their jobs with nothing lined up.               \"Even a year ago, I felt like I was working with more people that were like, 'I'm really burned out at my job, and if I don't have another job in 3 months, I think I'm still going to take a break,'\" Lemonik said.               Now, she's seeing more hesitation from her clients. \"It's less so that people are gripping to the job that they have, but more so that they're not willing to take that risk of leaving without another job,\" Lemonik added.               One of the most common questions Lemonik's clients ask her when they interview for jobs is how they can determine if the job is safe from layoffs.               The biggest takeaway that Lemonik shared? You can't definitively predict if a job is \"stable\" or \"safe.\"               \"I think we all have to have some stability within ourselves in the way that we build our own career paths and financial safety nets because you can't put your stability or safety in any employer. This is my honest take that I give people,\" Lemonik told BI.               That's why it can be helpful to build up an emergency fund and evaluate your current budget to see where you can cut back on spending. Upskilling and investing in your career can also be ways to negotiate your salary at your next job and preserve job security in an economic downturn.               Lemonik tells her clients to take advantage of the opportunity to do their due diligence on a job when hiring managers ask, \"Do you have any questions for me?\"               \"Could this be a department that's cut? Is this a smart type of role to be getting? Are these the first people out when there's no more budget left? These are the things people are trying to figure out,\" Lemonik said.               Asking the interviewer certain questions at the end of the interview can give you insights into how insulated the role is from economic volatility. Lemonik recommends asking about the direction of the company, as well as situational questions about how the company has dealt with challenges in the past.               She provided the following examples:               These questions allow you to examine if the role you're interviewing for has long-term growth potential. They also highlight what to expect from company leadership.               \"I think anything you can do to explore how the leaders of the company operate when things are not as certain is a good indicator of how the company is going to react to potentially inevitable changes,\" Lemonik said.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"ByBilly Bambrough  ByBilly Bambrough,  Senior Contributor.  03\/26 update below. This post was originally published on March 25 Bitcoin has surged over the last week as traders bet U.S. president Donald Trump could be pulling back from his threat of global trade tariffs (though fears are swirling over a new, mystery threat). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes\u2019 CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can \"uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!\" The bitcoin price has added around 10% since its early March lows but remains well off its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin set in January despite a a White House official revealing how Trump could spur the bitcoin price higher. Now, as a BlackRock executive predicts a \u201cbig catalyst\u201d for bitcoin could be on the horizon, traders are braced for meme stock darling GameStop to make a bitcoin-related announcement when it reports fourth-quarter results after Tuesday\u2019s market close\u2014potentially following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex\u2014A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump hosted bitcoin and crypto company executives, including Strategy's ... More Michael Saylor, at a White House bitcoin and crypto summit. Last month, GameStop received a proposal from Strive Asset Management recommending that the brick-and-mortar video game retailer convert its $5 billion in cash reserves into bitcoin, a move it claims would transform the company into the \"premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector.\" Strive Asset Management chief executive Matt Cole told GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen that he \u201chas an incredible opportunity.\" \u201cLetter received,\u201d Cohen then posted to X. Just weeks earlier, Cohen set social media alight when he posted a picture of himself with Michael Saylor, the founder of software company turned acquisition vehicle Strategy. 03\/26 update: GameStop has followed through with teased plans to adopt bitcoin, aping Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy that\u2019s built up the world\u2019s biggest corporate stash of bitcoin\u2014with self-styled \u201cbitcoin historian\u201d Pete Rizzo telling traders to \u201cbuckle up.\u201d While GameStop has $4.75 billion in cash and said it plans to use some of this cash as well as future debt or equity issuances to buy bitcoin, it didn't commit to an amount, somewhat disappointing those who had hoped the company would reveal a firm bitcoin-buy. GameStop's \"investment policy permits investments in certain cryptocurrency assets, including bitcoin and U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, and if the company acquires bitcoin or U.S. dollar denominated stablecoins, the company will be exposed to certain risks associated with bitcoin or stablecoins, respectively,\" the company's fourth-quarter earnings report read. GameStop\u2019s stock has climbed almost 20% overnight after the announcement, though it remains well below the sky-high levels it reached in 2021. Meme stock traders, unofficially led by Keith \"Roaring Kitty\" Gill, helped send the stock price of companies, including GameStop and cinema chain AMC, to astronomical levels alongside cryptocurrencies like dogecoin. Traders are betting GameStop could become the next Strategy, which has seen its stock explode 3,000% since it started buying bitcoin in the summer of 2020. \"Welcome to team bitcoin, Ryan Cohen,\" Saylor posted to X along with the photo of their pair. That growing team includes Metaplanet and Semler Scientific, both of which have adopted so-called bitcoin treasury strategies. \u201cOverall, news about crypto initiatives could make GameStop stock even more susceptible to sharp movements,\" analysts at crypto payments platform B2BinPay, said in emailed comments.  \u201cIn the short term, this has already acted as a positive decision, as reflected in the company\u2019s stock growth, however, it also carries risks of volatility. Stablecoins, of course, won\u2019t carry those risks, but bitcoin can go both ways \u2014 offering potential for growth but also for a drop. So if the crypto market takes a big hit, it could negatively affect GameStop\u2019s financial standing.\u201d Sign up now for CryptoCodex\u2014A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher over the last year, recently falling back from its all-time ...

Nope. Absolutely not. Which is why I never leave this country without a universal travel adapter. Basically, it\u2019s six plug adapters in one. Depending on which one you get, it might come with USB ports so you can charge multiple devices in one outlet. Granted, it\u2019s bulkier than buying one or two specialized adapter plugs, but if you\u2019ve got a multi-continent itinerary, it\u2019s a game-changer. What I like about this one from Epicka is that it comes with a spare fuse in case things go sideways with voltage. The only caveat is that, although it says \u201cuniversal,\u201d it\u2019s technically only the four most common types of plugs. That\u2019ll get you by in most countries, but it\u2019s not a guarantee in places like Brazil, South Africa, or India. Even so, I\u2019ll take this over price gouging at airport electronics shops or having to take time out of my schedule to visit a local hardware store. \u2014 Victoria Song, senior reviewer This all-in-one 20W power cube boasts three AC outlets, two USB-A ports, and one USB-C port. Nobody wants to carry a power strip or an extension cord with them on their vacation. It\u2019s probably unnecessary if you\u2019re staying in relatively modern buildings and definitely unnecessary if you\u2019re camping. But sometimes you want to stay in a charming historical hotel or a lovely cabin in the woods, and it\u2019s only when you go to charge your devices at night that you realize that the only electrical socket in the bedroom is in the corner farthest away from the bed and there are already two lamps plugged into it.  Older buildings especially suffer from what I can only describe as loose socket syndrome, where those very convenient modern boxy socket extenders with five different USB and USB-C charging ports simply cannot stay in place and fall right out of the wall because they\u2019re too heavy. After one (totally pleasant) vacation where I had to charge my phone, watch, AirPods, and laptop in a weird corner of my room with the plug-in charging hub propped up on a strategically balanced mountain of books and sham pillows, I bought this Anker combination extension cord \/ power strip. It\u2019s not a full power strip \u2014 just a cube with a few sockets along with USB and USB-C charging ports at the end of a five-foot cable. I\u2019ve brought it on a few trips since then. It takes up extra space in my suitcase but each time has left me feeling vindicated about the purchase.  The three prongs at the end of the cable are static, rather than folding flat for easy packing. This is key because the loose sockets of older buildings reject the beautiful convenience of folding prongs. There are more than enough sockets for one person, and with some finagling (and maybe an extra charging brick), it can accommodate two people\u2019s devices. If you\u2019re traveling overseas, don\u2019t forget to purchase a different plug type. \u2014 Sarah Jeong, deputy features editor Meross makes a handy add-on that can transform a variety of garage door models into smart doors that you can open remotely. It works with Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings. Most of the things I own are, frankly, just unreliable enough to be annoying. All except for one or two, and of those, the one I love most of all is the Meross Smart Wi-Fi Garage Door Opener for HomeKit. And my love for it isn\u2019t just about its rock-solid performance \u2014 it\u2019s because, as far as I can tell, it\u2019s compatible with almost any garage door opener on the market and across time itself. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an exaggeration, either. The chunky mustard yellow all-metal box that cranks my garage door open \u2014 the Model 455 by Automatic Doorman \u2014 was made, by my loose estimation, sometime between the fall of Rome and 1975.  But Meross\u2019 adapter was $30 \u2014 and to my amazement, after a very simple installation, it worked and continues to do so almost every time I need it to. Best of all, I don\u2019t have to carry the chunky remote with me on my bike when I leave because I can just talk into my Apple Watch when I return and coast right in. \u2014 Wes Davis, weekend editor Hoto\u2019s electric screwdriver is perfect for making small- to medium-sized repairs around the house. In addition to a USB-C port, the screwdriver comes with a magnetic case and 25 steel bits. I picked up Hoto\u2019s electric screwdriver because my former boss at The Verge, Dan Seifert, would often pitch it around gift guide season. I\u2019m glad I did, though, because it now sits alongside a handful of tools I use on an almost weekly basis. I wouldn\u2019t suggest using it for real household projects that require some serious torque, but it\u2019s incredibly handy for tightening the legs on my desk, assembling furniture, and making sure my bike seat isn\u2019t going to come off mid-ride. It\u2019s also equipped with a USB-C port for charging, a nifty LED light that lets you ditch the headlamp, and a case for housing the 25 steel bits. Oh, and it really does make for a great little gift. I guess Dan was right. \u2014 Brandon Widder, senior commerce editor A fantastic silent linear mechanical switch for Cherry MX-compatible keyboards. Islets are smooth and quiet, with a long spring that gives them a top-heavy, almost tactile force curve. They\u2019re 3-pin switches, so they work with most hot-swappable mechanical keyboards that take 3- or 5-pin switches. These are my current favorite switches. The Kailh Deep-Sea Silent Pro Islets are nearly identical to the fantastic switches in the HHKB Studio, just much less expensive. The Islets are silent linear switches, with an extra-long spring, so the actuation force curve is strongest right at the beginning and then smooth the rest of the way, giving them an almost Topre-like tactile sensation. (Pitchforks down; I said almost.) They\u2019re an instant upgrade for any hot-swappable keyboard that takes Cherry MX-compatible switches, and I\u2019ve been using them as my daily drivers for a while. There\u2019s also a tactile version, which I don\u2019t like as much.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Business Insider Edition  Warren Buffett is off to a roaring start to 2025 with shares of his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate up 16%, trouncing the benchmark S&P 500's 2% decline.          The stock surge has boosted Buffett's net worth by an unmatched $23 billion, vaulting him past Bill Gates into sixth place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a $165 billion fortune.               The 94-year-old business icon and his company are riding high as investors seek shelter from roiling markets, trusting the legendary bargain hunter to pounce if asset prices crash and the economy tanks.               They're also cheering a rebound at Geico, which is owned by Berkshire, and banking on Buffett's planned successor to deliver when the time comes.               \"Berkshire is a stable, solid ship in a sea of uncertainty right now,\" Paul Lountzis, the president and founder of Lountzis Asset Management, told Business Insider.               The longtime Berkshire shareholder pointed to the company's \"rock of Gibraltar\" balance sheet, which boasted more than $320 billion in cash, Treasurys, and other liquid assets at the end of December, and stocks worth more than $270 billion.               During his 60 years in charge, Buffett has transformed Berkshire from a failing textile mill into a\u00a0$1 trillion juggernaut. He's acquired scores of businesses across myriad industries, including See's Candies, Precision Castparts, and the BNSF Railway, and built multibillion-dollar stakes in blue-chip stocks such as Apple, Coca-Cola, and American Express.               Berkshire stock has soared in value by more than 5,500,000% during Buffett's tenure, crushing the S&P's roughly 39,000% gain over the same period. The stock has compounded at about 20% a year for six decades \u2014 almost twice as fast as the benchmark.               The billionaire philanthropist is also known for prudently managing Berkshire, prizing long-term success over short-term gains.               \"In an uncertain world, investors place a higher value on the certainty that Berkshire offers,\" Darren Pollock, a portfolio manager at Cheviot Value Management and another longtime shareholder, told BI. \"Consistency and reliability often get a bid when froth exits financial markets.\"               Cathy Seifert, a senior vice president at CFRA Research and a longtime Berkshire analyst, said there's been a \"flight to quality amid an upswing in market and geopolitical volatility,\" and investors see Buffett's sprawling empire as a safe haven.               Buffett is a value investor who specializes in spotting and scooping up stocks and businesses at a discount. The best time to do that is when prices tumble and the pool of buyers dries up.               \"Warren Buffett has often demonstrated he is at his best with capital allocation with more challenging conditions,\" Macrae Sykes, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, told BI. He's \"shown a unique ability to see through the noise and find value.\"               For example, the legendary investor struck lucrative deals with Goldman Sachs, General Electric, Mars, Dow Chemical, and Swiss Re during the financial crisis.               He deployed more than $21 billion across those five transactions between 2008 and 2009, securing positions worth a combined $26 billion \u2014 and yielding $2.1 billion in yearly interest and dividends \u2014 by the end of 2009.               Fast-forward to today, and Berkshire's huge \"cash cushion\" gives it \"tremendous firepower for bargain hunting should opportunities arise,\" Pollock said.               Buffett's patience, discipline, and refusal to buy into bubbles and trendy stocks have paid off in the past. When the dot-com bubble burst and the S&P fell by an average of 14% a year between 2000 and 2002, Berkshire shares rose by 10% on average during those three years as investors dumped expensive tech stocks and returned to tried-and-true names.               Under Buffett's leadership, Berkshire stock \"substantially outperformed\" the market in 10 of the 12 years the S&P declined, David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland who's followed Buffett for four decades, told BI.               Berkshire's business performance has also made it a draw for investors. The company has some \"fundamental momentum,\" Sykes said, noting it generated about $30 billion in operating cash flow last year, or about $600 million a week.               Geico's profits soared last year as Todd Combs, the car insurer's CEO and one of Buffett's two investment managers, boosted efficiency and updated its underwriting practices.               Buffett described Geico as a \"long-held gem that needed major repolishing\" in his latest annual letter and hailed its recent performance as \"spectacular.\"               The recovery helped lift Berkshire's operating earnings by 71% year-over-year last quarter. Kass said that was a key reason its shares have outpaced Magnificent Seven stocks such as Microsoft and Alphabet this year.               Seifert said the Geico turnaround should \"significantly aid\" Berkshire's profit growth given it's one of the company's most important business units. She also noted the Federal Reserve's hikes to interest rates since 2022 have made Berkshire's mountain of bonds more lucrative.               Buffett's company raked in nearly $22 billion in interest, dividend, and investment income last year, up from less than $16 billion in 2023 and about $10 billion in 2022.               Buffett and Berkshire have become virtually synonymous, making it hard to imagine another CEO filling his shoes. Yet the demise of his longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, a few weeks shy of his 100th birthday in late 2023, underscored the Buffett era is nearing an end.               Buffett has carefully planned for his departure and worked to build shareholders' comfort with Greg Abel, the head of Berkshire's non-insurance businesses and his chosen successor.               A final reason for Berkshire's stock gains this year is \"growing confidence\" in Abel's ability to make Berkshire's subsidiaries sing and shrewdly allocate the company's capital, Sykes said.               Buffett has \"done a great job preparing the firm for a future without him,\" Lountzis said. \"There is not much more he could do \u2014 though I do wish he could clone himself and Charlie to keep running it for another 60 years.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Business Insider Edition  Closing arguments began Wednesday morning and stretched into the early evening in the Charlie Javice fraud trial in New York \u2014 with one word playing a starring role.          That pivotal word is \"user.\"               Federal prosecutors say that almost four years ago, Javice defrauded the nation's largest bank, JPMorgan Chase, out of $175 million, the price the bank paid for her financial aid website, Frank.               \"Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar sold Frank for $175 million worth of lies,\" prosecutor Nicholas Chiuchiolo told jurors, beginning his closing argument against the website founder and her lieutenant-turned-codefendant.               The pair consistently assured JPMorgan \"that Frank had over 4 million users and that a user was someone who'd started an account by providing their first name, last name, phone number, and email,\" Chiuchiolo said.               These users never existed, the prosecutor told jurors. At most, the website had collected names, phone numbers, and emails for 300,000, the prosecutor said.               Instead, Javice and Amar \"generated fake data for 4 million people who did not exist\" and passed it off to the bank as real to clinch the deal and become multi-millionaires, he said. \"The names, phone numbers, emails? All were fake.\"               Prosecutors say Javice tricked bank executives into thinking that if they purchased Frank, they would become the new owners of the names, emails, and addresses of all 4 million of these Frank users, all of whom had used the site to at least begin filing out a federal financial aid form.               They were \"at the start of their financial journeys,\" the prosecutor said. JPMorgan could use Frank's data \u2014 those names and other contact information \u2014 to reach these \"users\" directly, selling them their very first checking accounts, credit cards, and car loans.               In five weeks of testimony, and in closing arguments Wednesday, lawyers for Javice sought to show that this is not what she had meant by users at all.               Instead, her lawyers say, she told the bank that 4 million people had merely visited the website and clicked around a bit, a number supported by Google Analytics.               There's no way the nation's largest bank would have ever believed that four million people had created Frank website accounts and begun filling out federal financial aid forms, Javice's lead defense lawyer, Jose Baez, told jurors.               \"If 4.25 million people went to that website, there's no way they all filled out FAFSAs,\" Baez said, referring to the Free Application for Federal Student Aid filled out by 17 million students a year.               \"I'm going to tell you straight up \u2014 they knew,\" Baez said of the bank, which he said had conducted its own investigation into Frank. \"They knew exactly what they were buying,\" he said.               \"'User' means many things, including a website visitor,\" read a slide used in closing arguments for Amar. His defense lawyer, Matthew I. Menchel, complained to jurors that prosecutors are unfairly trying to \"lump together\" Amar and Javice.               Amar was out of the loop for what prosecutors are calling key moments in their alleged conspiracy and actually urged that some incorrect traffic statistics be corrected during negotiations, the lawyer argued.               \"That's inconsistent with someone who is trying to defraud somebody, and it's inconsistent with their working together,\" Menchel told jurors.               Throughout five weeks of testimony, Javice's defense lawyers have pushed the theory that she was a young and promising microfinance star. The bank wanted her, not her data, and only cried \"fraud\" months later out of buyer's remorse, Baez told jurors Wednesday.               Baez, who delivered closing statements as lead lawyer in the acquittal of Casey Anthony, frequently used humor to convince jurors it was laughable to think JPMorgan Chase was ever bamboozled.               \"Somebody robbed the bank!\" he mocked, of the bank's reaction in firing Javice and shuttering Frank a year after the merger. \"It was Charlie the Kid!\"               At another point, Baez joked that to JPMorgan, $175 million was \"Not a lot of money at all. This was Monopoly money.\"               And who was the banker the Monopoly game was based on, he asked hypothetically, answering his own question to laughter in the courtroom: \"JPMorgan himself.\"               A central dispute in front of jurors \u2014 as they listened to closing arguments by attorneys for the government, for Javice, and for her co-defendant \u2014 is this: How did Javice, 32, and Amar, 50, define \"user\" in negotiations with JPMorgan? As a nameless clicker? Or as a potential Chase customer whom the bank could email and text?               US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein raised this question in court on Tuesday as part of his preparation for instructing the jury on the law before deliberations.               \"What about the argument that by telling Chase that 'We have 4.25 million users,' that they were telling the truth?\" he asked Georgia Kostopoulos, an assistant US attorney.               \"It was a lie,\" the prosecutor quickly answered.               \"But we have a number exactly the same as the number of users that visited the website,\" the judge pushed, referring to the Google Analytics total. \"And they're called users.\"               Kostopoulos countered that both Javice and Amar were present at a July 21, 2021, meeting where Javice assured JPMorgan executives that a user was someone who had provided Frank with their name and other personal identifying information as part of signing up for a website account.               The judge limited closing arguments to two hours per side.               The government presented its arguments first, followed by Javice's. After lunch, jurors heard arguments on behalf of Amar, followed by a brief rebuttal statement by the government.                The two co-defendants are charged with conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud, along with separate counts of wire, bank, and securities fraud. They face potential maximum sentences of 30 years in prison.       March 26, 2025: This story was updated throughout the day on Wednesday to include details from daylong closing arguments.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"A key designer behind the Pentax 17 half-frame film camera has left Ricoh Imaging, as the company says it is pausing the Pentax film project to evaluate the market.  Kosmo Foto reports that the designer Takeo Suzuki, who goes by the moniker TKO, made the announcement on Instagram yesterday (Tuesday, March 25).  \u201cI have decided to leave Ricoh Imaging: the beloved and glorious brand Pentax in March,\u201d TKO writes. \u201cSince joining the company, I have been involved in the design and planning of many digital cameras, and especially in the past few years, in the world of analog cameras.\u201d  \u201cIt has been an irreplaceable asset and happiness for me to have been able to interact with many people involved and fans,\u201d he continues. \u201cI have been very busy for several years, so I would like to take a break for a while.\u201d The Pentax 17 camera he worked on was one of the most-hyped cameras of last year which undoubtedly would have been a stressful time for the production team. TKO says he wants time to \u201cread books, draw pictures, and, of course, take photos.\u201d   In response to the news, Ricoh Imaging Europe tells Kosmo Foto that it is still gauging the response to the Pentax 17 and is not rushing a decision on future film projects.  \u201cTKO contributed significantly to Pentax design and development throughout his career, most recently playing a key role in the launch of the Pentax 17. We remain grateful for his valuable input and wish him the best as he moves on to new endeavors,\u201d Ricoh tells Kosmo Foto.  \u201cOn the business side, film cameras currently play a smaller role than our established GR line. Because this is our first new film camera in more than 15 years, we need time to gather feedback, meet with customers, and learn what they appreciated \u2013 or felt was missing \u2013 before making decisions on future film products.\u201d  Ricoh adds that \u201cwhile TKO played a significant role in the Pentax Film Project, his departure does not affect the possibility of future film models.\u201d  Become a PetaPixel Member and access our content ad-free. \u00a9 2025 PetaPixel Inc.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Growing economic uncertainty is going to take a toll on the advertising industry this year. Overall ad revenues are still expected to rise, but at a slower pace than previously projected, according to the media intelligence firm MAGNA (IPG). In its spring 2025 forecast, the firm revised its ad revenue growth estimate to 4.3%, down from an earlier projection of 4.9%. The downward adjustment follows a record year in 2024, when political advertisements and the Summer Olympics helped push  ad sales to $380 billion \u2014 a 12.4% increase and one of the strongest performances in 25 years, second only to the post-pandemic rebound of 2021. While MAGNA had already anticipated a slowdown, the firm cited recent \u201ceconomic uncertainty\u201d as a reason for its further downward revision. \u201cMAGNA anticipates that the lack of visibility and risk of a trade war may cause marketing and advertising budgets to face freezes or cuts in industries that are most vulnerable to global trade, supply chain disruptions, and consumer confidence issues,\u201d the report stated. Among the key factors behind the adjustment include the recent stock market sell-off, concerns over rising food prices \u2014 such as spikes in essentials such as eggs \u2014 and the potential for trade disputes and supply chain disruptions. Such challenges could put pressure on sectors that typically fuel ad spending, including quick-service restaurants, consumer-packaged goods, and autos. \u201cThe current \u2013 hopefully temporary \u2013 dip in confidence has already dampened the dynamics of the ad market, prompting us to revise our growth forecast for 2025,\u201d said MAGAN executive vice president of global market intelligence Vincent L\u00e9tang in a statement.\u201cWhile total ad spend is still expected to grow in the mid-single digits, digital media ad sales will continue to experience high-single-digit growth. In contrast, most traditional media channels may face stagnating ad revenues this year.\u201d Traditional media owners are expected to take the biggest hit, with revenues declining 7.2% year over year. Linear television, including cable and satellite, is projected to fall by 5.9%, though streaming is helping to offset some of those losses, growing 14.3%.  Digital advertising, including search and social media, also remains resilient, with spending in those categories expected to climb 9.1%.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Business Insider Edition  Investors who think a recession is in the cards this year should brace for a double-digit correction to rattle the stock market, according to Bank of America.          Strategists at the bank said they see the S&P 500 potentially dropping to as low as 5,000 in the event unemployment\u00a0rises and the economy tips into a downturn. That implies the benchmark index dropping another 12% from levels on Wednesday.               After dropping to 5,000, the bank thinks the index could rebound, ending the year around 5,500.                The index is down more than 3% year-to-date. Fresh tariff concerns on Wednesday sparked a sell-off late in the session as traders reacted to news from the White House that President Donald Trump would announce auto tariffs at 4:00 p.m. ET. The S&P 500 dropped more than 1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 2%.                \"US labor market is gradually weakening. Eventually it accelerates to the upside and initial thrust tends to dent stocks. The US yield curve is steepening from inversion,\" the bank said, pointing to the inversion in the 2-10 Treasury yield curve, a notoriously accurate gauge for a coming recession.               That said, Bank of America's base case is for stocks to end the year higher. Strategists said they saw the benchmark index trading between 5,885 and 6,175, implying as much as 7% upside from current levels.       A recession is on the radar of more Wall Street forecasters lately. Fears of a downturn have climbed in recent weeks, particularly as markets digest weakening economic data and fret over the impact of tariffs.               The median market-implied recession odds across 20 asset classes and sectors climbed to 33% last week, up from a 0% market-implied probability in November, according to an analysis from David Rosenberg, economist and the president of Rosenberg Research.               GDP, meanwhile, is expected to shrink 1.8% this quarter, according to the latest Atlanta Fed GDPNow reading.               \"The implication for investors, as GDP estimates get ratcheted lower, is to reduce overall portfolio risk until more clarity emerges on the path ahead. We recommend tactically increasing defensive sector exposure in the equity portfolio, while simultaneously overweighting fixed income relative to stocks,\" Rosenberg wrote in a note last week.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"AI hyperscaler's IPO could raise $2.5 billion, but Jeffrey Emanuel says it's a turkey  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Towards the end of January 2025, Jeffrey Emanuel, Founder and CEO of Pastel Network, wrote an interesting and insightful essay about Nvidia. More specifically, he discussed what he saw as its overvaluation and the threat it faced from a small Chinese startup called DeepSeek. noting, \u201chistory shows that markets eventually find a way around artificial bottlenecks that generate super-normal profits,\u201d and that, \u201cNvidia faces a much rockier path to maintaining its current growth trajectory and margins than its valuation implies.\u201d That article, which went viral, helped cause the largest-ever single-day drop in the stock market, wiping $2 trillion off global markets and slashing Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization by $600 billion. The latest target of Emanuel\u2019s observations is Roseland, New Jersey-based CoreWeave, which offers cloud infrastructure optimized for Nvidia GPUs and is expected to go public in the coming weeks in what will be a closely watched IPO. In his takedown of the company, Emanuel described it as the \u201cWeWork of AI,\u201d referring to the infamous flexible office space startup that was once valued at $47 billion but overexpanded, mismanaged funds, and collapsed after a failed IPO. As Emanuel wrote two weeks ago, \u201cIf it [CoreWeave] really IPOs for $30b+ then it\u2019s a much better short than NVDA ever was. They have absolutely no durable moat and will soon be structurally disadvantaged on the cost curve for inference for specific LLM models versus hyperscalers like AWS, which have their own proprietary silicon (because clearly CoreWeave doesn\u2019t know the first thing about making custom silicon, and won\u2019t anytime soon).\u201d MarketWatch picked up on this and cautioned investors. The site wrote, \u201cCoreWeave set an estimated price range of $47 to $55 a share for its initial public offering, and an offering size of 49 million shares. Based on the midpoint of the estimated range, CoreWeave\u2019s IPO would raise $2.5 billion for the company. That would make its IPO the fourth since 2022 to raise at least $2.5 billion, after Lineage, Arm Holdings, and Kenvue, according to Renaissance Capital.\u201d Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! \u201cCoreWeave would have a market cap of about $25 billion based on the midpoint of the estimated pricing range,\u201d the site added. While that\u2019s far less than the $35 billion many market watchers have been predicting, Emanuel says, \u201cthat\u2019s still at least $20b too high for this turkey!\u201d Thanks to Steve Gelsi at @MarketWatch for helping me warn investors about the CoreWeave IPO. Luckily, they've already had to reduce the valuation by $10b from the initial price talk of $35b, but that's still at least $20b too high for this turkey! https:\/\/t.co\/fnJorj87NkMarch 20, 2025 Wayne Williams is a freelancer writing news for TechRadar Pro.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"  \t\t\t\tFailures\t\t\t  Instead of doing things like protecting consumers or market competition, Trump FCC boss Brendan Carr has spent his first few months in office abusing agency authority to threaten companies that refuse to kiss the Trump administration\u2019s ass. A cornerstone of those efforts has been to leverage merger approvals to get companies to support core administration policies like\u2026 being more racist.  For example, he\u2019s launched phony inquiries into Verizon because the company wasn\u2019t racist enough for Carr\u2019s liking. He\u2019s launched similar \u201cinvestigations\u201d into Comcast because the company still paid fleeting lip service to the value of diversity in hiring. And he\u2019s harassed CBS\/Paramount with fake investigations based on completely bogus accusations of being \u201cbiased against Conservatives.\u201d All three companies have something in common: they\u2019re hoping the FCC approves planned mergers and further (usually harmful) market consolidation. Verizon\u2019s looking for approval for its $20 billion merger with Frontier. Comcast is broadly rumored to be eyeing a merger with either T-Mobile or Charter (or both). CBS\/Paramount is looking for regulatory approval of its $8 billion merger with Skydance. Carr\u2019s been pretty cocky since he got into office. Normally if you\u2019re going to abuse government power like this you\u2019d apply a little subtlety to it. But in this case Carr is openly crowing to the press that they have to bow to Trumpism if they want their (often pointless and shitty) mergers to be approved. Again, for now that mostly involves demands that they be more racist: \u201cAny businesses that are looking for FCC approval, I would encourage them to get busy ending any sort of their invidious forms of\u00a0DEI\u00a0discrimination.\u201d U.S. media giants, hopeful of getting tax cuts and deregulation and merger approvals (and afraid of losing access), are more than happy to oblige. That involves cheerfully couching a blatantly racist attack on popular civil rights under the nomenclature of \u201cDEI\u201d: Trump authoritarians hijacked the \u201cDEI\u201d term because they\u2019re hoping to conflate the elimination of bare-bones corporate inclusivity initiatives with the elimination of popular civil rights reforms. It allows them to normalize their bigotry and disguise it as an act of essential efficiency. And our biggest consolidated media companies, looking for favor, access, deregulation, and tax breaks, are more than happy to comply.  All three investigations into all three companies are utterly baseless harassment. Not a single one of the three have actually done anything wrong. But when you read through any major outlet story on this subject, that\u2019s not made clear, and Carr and the Trump administration\u2019s racism are framed as ordinary and valid complaints. The normalization is on display pretty much everywhere you look, and it\u2019s embarrassing. Carr of course tries to pretend all of this bullshit is serious, legal, adult policy making, and the press is generally happy to play along. See how Deadline frames the issue, for example: \u201cUnder the law, Carr said, the FCC can only \u201cmove forward and approve a transaction if we find that doing so serves the public interest,\u201d Carr said. \u201cIf there\u2019s businesses out there that are still promoting invidious forms of DEI discrimination, I really don\u2019t see a path forward where the FCC could reach the conclusion that approving the transaction is going to be in the public interest.\u201d That\u2019s where a useful journalism organization would indicate that Carr doesn\u2019t really have a history of \u201cserving the public interest.\u201d He\u2019s generally been the textbook definition of regulatory capture, constantly rubber stamping the policies of the giant companies he overseas (like AT&T) and undermining consumer protection. It\u2019s also where a functional journalism industry would point out that Carr\u2019s claim that civil rights reforms are \u201cinvidious discrimination\u201d are bullshit, and the motivation is rank bigotry.  Instead, they cower like little frightened deer, much to Carr\u2019s delight. It is a conscious choice for media organizations and journalists to parrot bad-faith clowns entirely unskeptically and frame their actions as \u201cserious policy.\u201d  As I predicted repeatedly, unconstrained by re-election and more fully propped up by our broken court system, Trump 2.0 is so much, much worse than Trump 1.0.  Trump 1.0 involved \u201cboring\u201d old captured regulators rubber stamping all manner of shitty mergers (usually without reading or caring about the actual market harms). Trump 2.0 involves approving those same mergers, but not before abusing the approval process to demand companies be even shittier than they already were. Feckless giants like Comcast will be particularly happy to oblige.    \tFiled Under: approval, bigotry, brendan carr, civil rights, competition, dei, fcc, journalism, media, mergers, racism, regulators   \tCompanies: comcast  The party of small government, folks. typo: onstantly rubber stamping the policies of the giant companies he oversees (like AT&T)\u2026 Is this going to require a revision of form 10-K? Instead, they cower like little frightened deer, much to Carr\u2019s delight. It is a conscious choice for media organizations and journalists to parrot bad-faith clowns entirely unskeptically and frame their actions as \u201cserious policy.\u201d If all you do is parrot unchallenged or investigated what someone tells you then you\u2019re not a journalist or doing journalism, you\u2019re just a PR stooge cosplaying as one. With many of the bigger news outlets in the hands of a few billionaires one should look hard to find independent journalism. (Thanks Mike!) And if the boss is expecting to gain by giving a platform to political clowns (apologies for offending real clowns) then you can expect that your employer is hiving them that platform. Welcome to the world where fake-news is presented as the real deal. The right thing: No ass-kissing, and no mergers. What will happen? Probably both of those very bad no-good options. What the fuck does the FCC have to do with company policies? Can you even imagine anyone in the past pulling this shit over anything at all \u2013 never mind the rubber-stamping. Aneurysms would have been had over anything remotely near the edge of, e.g., the FCC\u2019s, bailiwick. Hell, the FCC wasn\u2019t even allowed to do blatantly FCC things. What authority will the FCC have to block mergers though? Whatever authority they claim and whatever the courts refuse to correct. This is rule by wall spaghetti. They\u2019ll just keep throwing.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Business Insider Edition  23andMe cofounder Linda Avey is mourning what the biotech company could have become.          Avey reflected on 23andMe \u2014 and criticized former CEO Anne Wojcicki \u2014 in a LinkedIn post on Wednesday, saying that \"it was time to express my views on the company, after witnessing the downfall of an idea and brand that could have become the world's leading digital health platform.\"               On Sunday, 23andMe filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and announced Wojcicki's resignation. Avey worked alongside Wojcicki and Paul Cusenza to launch the biotech company in Silicon Valley nearly twenty years ago. The company makes direct-to-consumer DNA test kits and explores genetic research. Avey served as co-president from 2006 to 2009 and remained a company board member until 2011.               In the post, Avey said the idea for 23andMe sparked after working in life science research for years.               \"A lightbulb went on \u2014 if I was interested in accessing my own data, wouldn't others feel the same way? Getting deeply personalized information about what makes us 'us' seemed undeniable. It didn't take long for the concept to unfold,\" she said.               Avey said she pursued this goal under 23andMe until 2009, when her time at the company was \"cut short.\"               \"My time at the company was cut short in 2009, when my co-founder Anne convinced the board that she should run the company. And I must be honest, I was frustrated with the direction the company took after that point,\" Avey said. \"After my departure, she architected a majority vote for herself that eliminated board governance, even as the board expanded over the following funding rounds. For better or worse, the buck stopped with her. It came as no surprise when the board resigned last year.\"               Avey said that 23andMe \"was in a unique position\" initially, and it's \"painful to think what could have been.\"               \"The company has amassed one of the largest genetic data collections in the world, and to Anne's credit, created a terrific consumer brand. We can only imagine the importance of the dataset that could have been built, combining blood work, deeper gene sequencing, wearable data, and providing actionable insights,\" Avey said. \"Now, the market is fragmented with data siloed in many different companies.\"               Avey said 23andMe \"lost its way\" without \"consumer-focused product development\" and \"proper governance.\"               \"The 14+ million people who bought into the concept deserve to see their data moved to a secure platform with new leadership and vision,\" Avey said.               Avey rounded out her statement by emphasizing the importance of a balanced C-Suite.               \"There are many cautionary tales buried in the 23andMe story. Striking a balance between the desire for founder control and board oversight is essential; otherwise, why have a board at all?' Avey said. \"It's a familiar trope in Silicon Valley that wealth translates into unquestionable business savvy. But no matter how great an idea, the importance of the dynamics of the founding team and their ability to listen to feedback is key.\"               Avey told BI it \"seemed inevitable\" that 23andMe would file for bankruptcy but she's \"hopeful the data land in a good home.\"               Wojcicki and representatives for 23andMe did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.               23andMe has weathered several storms since 2023.               Although privacy concerns have bogged down the company for years, criticism spiked that October over news that some user data had been compromised. Hackers claiming access to the data, including birth details and names, were selling it on the dark web. 23andMe told BI the ancestry data for almost 7 million users were accessed. Following a class action lawsuit, the company agreed to a $30 million settlement last September.               That same month, the independent directors of 23andMe's board resigned in a letter addressed to Wojcicki, saying it's \"clear that we differ on the strategic direction for the Company going forward.\"               23andMe announced three new independent board members in October 2024 and added another member this month.               Wojcicki landed in the hot seat in 2024 when an SEC filing said she \"would be open to considering third-party takeover proposals.\" After consumers expressed concerns over what could happen to their personal data, Wojcicki reversed course.               The cracks at 23andMe deepened last November when the company announced it was restructuring its business, laying off roughly 40% of its staff, and ending further development of its therapeutics program.               Most recently, 23andMe said it will continue to operate while seeking a buyer.               \"After a thorough evaluation of strategic alternatives, we have determined that a court-supervised sale process is the best path forward to maximize the value of the business,\" chair Mark Jensen said in a press release. \"We expect the court-supervised process will advance our efforts to address the operational and financial challenges we face, including further cost reductions and the resolution of legal and leasehold liabilities.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Business Insider Edition  As Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang gave his keynote address at the company's annual GTC conference to an audience of roughly 17,000 people in San Jose, California, last week, dozens of companies sat on the edge of their seats to find out if they'd get a mention. Some had a glimpse of the slides ahead of time, but no one knew for certain until the words came out of Huang's mouth.          DataDirect Networks, or DDN, was one of the lucky ones to leave the arena happy. Huang named the company alongside Dell, HP Enterprise, Hitachi, and IBM. But while those firms have enjoyed broader name recognition in the tech world for decades, DDN was invited on the rocket ship that is Nvidia just a few years ago \u2014 and everything changed.               DDN makes hardware, but more importantly software that allows GPU users to access their stored data fast. It cuts down on latency, which is the industry term for lag in AI systems that can delay, for example, the answer to a question asked of a chatbot like ChatGPT.               When Nvidia sells $100 worth of GPUs, DDN's opportunity is $5-10 dollars.               \"You have to have the right amount of performance, reliability, and stability to extract your data at full speed, real-time, to feed the GPUs,\" Paul Bloch, DDN's 64-year-old President, told Business Insider.               The company has been working with Nvidia for about eight years. Before that, it served the stable, but much smaller industry of supercomputers for decades.               Bloch and CEO Alex Bouzari are fixtures of the supercomputing world. Before the AI boom, top research universities, government labs, and the oil and gas industry knew them well. But mainstream data centers didn't need them. They do now.               \"For the very first time, your storage system will be GPU-accelerated,\" Huang said at GTC.               As data sets grow larger and AI is used at scale for data-heavy applications like real-time video, Bloch can see a day when the company scales independently of Nvidia.               \"All of a sudden it's much easier to deliver the value in AI because we've already done it in the past with similar market,' Bloch said. \"That's why the success of the company has gone exponential.\"               DDN has found a new gear in the age of AI. Conversations, fixes, new features, and deals that used to take weeks and months now take days. And Bloch and his team are learning to work at Jensen Huang's pace \u2014 what he calls the \"speed of light.\"           \"Jensen's emails are fantastic. They are 10 words or less,\" Bloch said.               Moving into the era of AI has taken some adjustments, but today, DDN and its competitors are essential to the parallel computing that enables AI. When a company seeks to set up a GPU cloud, it has to have a version of DDN's tech. And DDN is part of Nvidia's reference architecture, which is the recommended setup for maximal GPU performance.               Not all of Nvidia's customers choose to use these instructions, but the mere fact has brought DDN new customers. Hyperscalers have traditionally preferred to use their own recipes of parts and players in their data centers, but Bloch said that in the era of Nvidia's Blackwell, they are starting to come around.               Now it's preparing for a blockbuster third decade. In January, the company raised $300 million in growth funding from Blackstone at a $5 billion valuation, and Bloch got a congratulatory email from Huang at 6:30 a.m. the morning of the announcement, he said.               \"DDN does not need the money, per se,\" Bloch said. \"We're profitable.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"ByCatherine Brock  ByCatherine Brock,  Contributor.  Curating reliable investing tools that fit your needs can be time-consuming and frustrating.  The internet delivers a wealth of investing tools and information. Still, curating reliable investing resources that fit your needs can be maddening. You hit paywalls, dated or unverifiable information and technical data dumps without context. As a novice trader, you may not be ready for a paid service\u2014or willing to spend hours trying different tools in search of the right one. Fortunately, the trial-and-error work has been done for you. Six free and reliable investing tools for new investors are introduced below, with tips for using each one. You can forecast long-term wealth creation with a compound interest calculator like this one from SEC.gov. You input your current investment balance, monthly contribution, average annual interest rate and timeline to forecast an ending account balance. For example, you can estimate the growth of a $500 monthly investment over 20 years. Assuming your investment will appreciate in line with the stock market, which averages about 7% net of inflation annually, you'll amass more than $240,000. Increase the monthly amount to $600 and your wealth potential rises to almost $300,000. Stockanalysis.com and Tradingview.com have robust and free screeners for identifying appropriate investment opportunities. Stockanalysis.com is more user-friendly. It includes a stock screener, stock comparison tool and an ETF screener, among other things. Tradingview.com is focused more on stocks and technical data. Both sites allow you to create watch lists. Adding prospective stocks to a watch list before you buy is a great, no-risk way to improve your investing skills. You can try out different sets of investing parameters and add the resulting picks to watch lists for observation. If your picks are too volatile or too conservative over time, tweak the parameters and try again. Remember to evaluate your watch list stocks relative to their peer companies and the overall stock market. After all, any value change\u2014positive or negative\u2014can be good or bad, depending on what's happening in the industry, economy and financial markets. Stock dividend data, particularly yields, can be skewed when companies make irregular payouts or change their dividend amount. The best dividend data providers share actual dividend payment histories, so you can calculate yield yourself. Marketbeat.com is a good resource for dividend investors. The site appears to exclude special or non-recurring dividends from the yield calculation. Not all sites follow this practice, but this approach provides a more realistic yield value. You can and should double-check dividend yield so your income expectations are appropriate. If the company pays a consistent dividend, simply annualize the most recent regular payment and divide that amount by the stock price. Marketbeat also publishes a company's dividend growth record in years and its annualized three-year dividend growth rate. This data focus on dividend growth is somewhat unique. Want to know what\u2019s in the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) stock portfolio? Or what Bridgewater Associates is betting on right now? You can find this information on the SEC's website, but Whale Wisdom's reports are far easier to digest. For every portfolio, Whale Wisdom publishes shares held, market value, portfolio weighting and whether the number of shares held changed in the prior quarter. You can also drill down into specific stocks for some basic metrics, including market cap, P\/E ratio, operating cash flow growth and more. The SEC provides free, searchable public access to official company filings via its EDGAR database. You can look up quarterly and annual reports, insider trades, executive compensation, proxy statements for shareholder meetings and more. You can also find registration statements, shareholder reports and proxy statements for mutual funds. You can use SEC filings to verify corporate earnings and ownership information you find elsewhere online. These filings that may support your research: You can search for filings by company name. There is a separate search form for mutual fund and ETF information. The right resources can make investment research easy and fun. And when those right resources are free, you can spend time exploring features and expanding your investing know-how without feeling rushed. You will develop your own forecasting, screening and researching methods\u2014and these six investing tools make for a great starting point.","label":0}

This is the final look at local markets in February.  The big story for February was that existing home sales decreased year-over-year (YoY) following four consecutive months with a year-over-year increase.  Sales at 4.26 million on a Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate (SAAR) basis were above the consensus estimate; however, this was primarily because of the seasonal adjustment for February.   Housing economist Tom Lawler\u2019s estimate was very close (as usual).  Sales averaged over 5.5 million SAAR for the month of February in the 2017-2020 period. So, sales were still about 23% below pre-pandemic levels. ... Here is a look at months-of-supply using NSA sales. Since this is NSA data, it is likely months-of-supply will increase into the Summer.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Shares of American artificial intelligence leaders Nvidia and Tesla tumbled Wednesday, shedding hundreds of billions of market value and leading a broader selloff across big technology stocks, which have struggled throughout 2025. Jensen Huang, left, and Elon Musk appear together last decade. Nvidia stock and Tesla stock each dove nearly 6%, contributing heavily to a more than 1% decline in the benchmark S&P 500 and more than 2% drop for the tech-concentrated Nasdaq. AI chip designer Nvidia (about $170 billion) and electric vehicle maker Tesla ($52 billion) lost a combined $222 billion in market capitalization, a loss greater than the total valuation of General Electric, the U.S.\u2019 35th-largest public company. The historically volatile stocks of Nvidia and Tesla have frequently been among the biggest movers as investors digest the latest foreign policy of President Donald Trump during his nascent second term, and Wednesday was no exception. The losses came as the market\u2019s rally based on Trump\u2019s tariffs being less impactful than feared lost steam \u2013 CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street\u2019s fear gauge, spiked by 8% \u2013 as Trump reportedly prepares to announce a new slate of tariffs on car imports hours after his administration blacklisted dozens of Chinese tech companies from receiving American technology. Both Tesla and Nvidia are particularly hit hard by the potential of retaliatory trade actions from abroad, including from China, which accounts for more than 10% of both firms\u2019 revenues. Shares of Tesla\u2019s less valuable automaker rivals General Motors, Rivian and Stellantis declined at least 2% apiece, and shares of Nvidia\u2019s smaller chip competitors Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company each fell by more than 4%.  Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are among the richest people on the planet, but both tech executives lost billions Wednesday. The world\u2019s wealthiest person Musk\u2019s net worth slid $11 billion to $346 billion, while Huang\u2019s fortune slipped $6 billion to $100 billion, knocking him from 12th to 15th on Forbes\u2019 real-time billionaires rankings. Both Tesla and Nvidia enjoyed explosive stock market gains in 2023 and 2024 as leaders in the AI revolution, but have flailed during 2025\u2019s first three months. Shares of Nvidia and Tesla are down 15% and 33% year-to-date, respectively. Driving much of Nvidia\u2019s losses was a record-breaking selloff as investors fretted over whether Chinese generative AI breakthroughs would lead to less demand for Nvidia\u2019s pricey AI chips, while leading Tesla stock\u2019s slump are concerns Musk\u2019s polarizing role under Trump will ding sales of the company\u2019s electric cars; Tesla new vehicle registrations are down 49% year-over-year through 2025\u2019s first two months.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"ByMarco Chiappetta  ByMarco Chiappetta,  Contributor.  Synopsys headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif. Over the last few weeks, silicon and system design leader Synopsys, has introduced a plethora of new platforms and tools in their hardware-assisted verification (HAV) and virtual prototyping portfolios meant to streamline workflows and accelerate time to market for chips, systems and software across virtually all markets. Synopsys introduced its latest HAPS prototyping and ZeBu emulation systems \u2013 the HAPS-200 and ZeBu-200 \u2013 featuring AMD\u2019s latest Versal Premium VP1902 adaptive SoC, which deliver vastly improved capacity and better performance, compile times, and debugging capabilities. And just a couple of days ago, the company also introduced Virtualizer Native Execution on Arm Hardware, which is a comprehensive virtualizer suite supported on Arm server hardware, whether running in the cloud or on-premise, for modeling, simulation, debug, and analysis for Arm-based devices. The latest HAPS-200 prototyping and ZeBu-200 emulation systems are built on new Synopsys Emulation and Prototyping (EP-Ready) Hardware and target leading-edge chip and system designers and architects. Though the systems have some fundamental underlying similarities, each is tuned for specific workloads \u2013 either prototyping or emulation \u2013 and both offer significantly increased capacity and higher performance than its predecessor, to accelerate the development of today\u2019s larger and more complex chips, systems and software. HAPS-200 offers comprehensive prototyping, which enables early software development and validation, and ultimately affords users better hardware-software integration. ZeBu-200 on the other hand is for broad, rich emulation, for thorough verification of complex chips and SoC designs with extensive debug capabilities. \"With the industry approaching 100s of billions of gates per chip and 100s of millions of lines of software code in SoC and multi-die solutions, verification of advanced designs poses never before seen challenges,\u201d said Ravi Subramanian, chief product management officer, Synopsys. \u201cContinuing our strong partnership with AMD, our new systems deliver the highest HAV performance while offering the ultimate flexibility between prototyping and emulation use. Industry leaders are adopting Synopsys EP-Ready Hardware platforms for silicon to system verification and validation.\" Synopsys HAPS-200 and ZeBu-200 Systems. The new HAPS-200 and ZeBu-200 are complementary systems, but each excels at different things. HAPS-200 has been updated and enhanced with more powerful platform hardware and offers approximately 4 times the performance of the company\u2019s previous-gen system for pre-silicon hardware debugging. I should note, however, that the HAPS-200 still integrates with previous-gen systems. In fact, it leverages the existing HAPS-100 ecosystem and supports mixed HAPS-200\/100 setups. The HAPS-200 is scalable from single FPGA to multi-rack configurations as well, with capacities of up to 10.8 Billion Gates (BG). The Synopsys ZeBu-200 emulation system has been updated and upgraded as well, to support a design capacity of up to 15.4 BG, with up to double the runtime performance compared to the previous generation ZeBu EP2. The ZeBu-200 also offers faster compile times and up to 8X better debug bandwidth. Synopsys claims the ZeBu-200 offers up to 200 GB debug trace memory per module, with improved job scheduling and relocation too. All of this essentially equates to reduced turnaround times and increased development productivity \u2013 something all chip makers sorely need. Before sending any chip design off to the fab, it requires extensive qualification and testing \u2013 it is not cheap to re-spin a chip. HAPS and ZeBu help ensure optimal quality, before committing to fabrication. Synopsys isn\u2019t just about hardware and chip innovations, however. Its new Virtualizer Native Execution on Arm-based hardware will do for software development, what its HAPS and ZeBu systems do for prototyping and emulation. The Synopsys Virtualizer Native Execution on Arm will effectively accelerate software development for edge devices by improving capabilities and productivity of teams building software-defined products that leverage Arm architectures and instruction sets. As most of you probably know, Arm is near ubiquitous in the automotive, mobile, High-Performance Computing (HPC), and Internet of Things markets. Synopsys HAV Systems. \u201cSoftware-defined products are driving a re-engineering of product development from silicon to systems,\u201d said Ravi Subramanian, chief product management officer, Synopsys. \u201cVirtualizer Native Execution on Arm accelerates hardware\/software co-design by enabling new agile software development methodologies for Arm-based edge and high-performance computing applications.\u201d These kinds of performance increases across virtually every design and development stage are key for chip, system and platform designers in the current AI era, to remain competitive, reduce turnaround time and help speed time to market. A multitude of companies, from NVIDIA and AMD to smaller start-ups, have all committed to yearly updates for some new product releases. That is a tall order for any tech company, and tools like these offered by Synopsys are practically a prerequisite to achieve those goals in the current landscape. Chips and systems are getting more complex and there is a shortage of humans with the experience and expertise to design and build them. Faster, more capable, intelligent tools are paramount to ensure quality and ensure optimal time to market. The Synopsys HAPS-200 prototyping system and Virtualizer Native Execution on the Arm hardware suite are available now. The Synopsys ZeBu-200 emulation system, however, is available for early access customers only at this time.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"AP A ghost gun that police seized from an organized shoplifting crime ring in New York City, Nov. 26, 2024. AP WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a Biden administration regulation on the nearly impossible-to-trace weapons called ghost guns, clearing the way for continued serial numbers, background checks and age verification requirements to buy them in kits online. The 7-2 opinion found that existing gun laws allow regulation of the kits increasingly linked to crime. It comes after President Donald Trump ordered a review of federal gun policy that could undermine or reverse regulations championed by his predecessor. Advertisement Advertisement Sales of the homemade firearms known as ghost guns grew exponentially after kits came onto the market that let people easily build them at home, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in the majority opinion. \u201cSome home hobbyists enjoy assembling them. But criminals also find them attractive,\u201d he said. The number of ghost guns found at crime scenes around the country has also soared, according to federal data. Fewer than 1,700 were recovered by law enforcement in 2017, but that number grew to 27,000 in 2023, according to Justice Department data. Read More: For Most of U.S. History We've Had Both Gun Rights and Gun Regulations Since the federal rule was finalized, though, ghost gun numbers have flattened out or declined in several major cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Baltimore, according to court documents. Manufacturing of miscellaneous gun parts also dropped 36% overall, the Justice Department has said. Ghost guns are any privately made firearms without the serial numbers that allow police to trace weapons used in crime. The 2022 regulation was focused on kits sold online with everything needed to build a functioning firearm \u2014 sometimes in less than 30 minutes, according to court documents. Ghost guns have been used in high-profile crimes, including a mass shooting carried out with an AR-15-style ghost gun in Philadelphia that left five people dead. Police believe a ghost gun used in the slaying of UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO in Manhattan was made on a 3D printer rather than assembled from a kit of the kind at the center of the Supreme Court case. Finalized at the direction of then-President Joe Biden, the \u201cframe and receiver\u201d rule requires companies to treat the kits like other firearms by adding serial numbers, running background checks and verifying that buyers are age 21 or older. Gun groups challenged the rule in court in the case known as Garland v. VanDerStok. Most crimes are committed with traditional firearms, not ghost guns, they argued. It's legal for people to build their own firearms at home, the challengers said, arguing that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives overstepped its authority by trying to regulate the kits. The Supreme Court majority disagreed, pointing out that the law gives the ATF the power to regulate items that can be quickly made into working firearms. \u201cThe \u2018Buy Build Shoot\u2019 kit can be 'readily converted' into a firearm too, for it requires no more time, effort, expertise, or specialized tools to complete,\u201d Gorsuch wrote, referring to a specific product. Some kits may take more time to build into guns and therefore fall outside of the ATF\u2019s power, he wrote, but many of the most popular kits are subject to regulation. In response to the ruling, a Justice Department spokesperson said the administration would \u201ccontinue to support and defend the Second Amendment rights of all Americans.\u201d Gun safety groups celebrated the ruling, with Everytown Law executive director Eric Tirschwell saying the rule also had broad support from law enforcement. \u201cFundamentally, today's decision confirms the ghost gun industry is dead as a viable business model,\" he said. A Michigan woman whose son lost an eye when he was accidently shot by a friend who bought a ghost gun before he was old enough to legally buy a typical weapon also applauded. \u201cWe are deeply relieved by today\u2019s ruling, which will help ensure that a tragedy like ours never happens again,\u201d she said. New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin said the ATF policy is a major factor in two years of record-low numbers of shootings in his state. \u201cThese are common-sense regulations on ghost guns that all too often end up in the hands of felons,\u201d he said. The court previously expanded Second Amendment rights with a finding that modern gun regulations must fit within historical traditions. The justices also struck down a firearm regulation from President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration, a ban on gun accessories known as bump stocks that enable rapid fire. In a dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the ghost gun rule should meet the same fate. The kits, he wrote, are only firearm parts and shouldn't be subject to a regulation that could open the door to rules on other popular weapons. \u201cCongress could have authorized ATF to regulate any part of a firearm or any object readily convertible into one,\" he wrote. \u201cBut, it did not.\u201d Justice Samuel Alito also filed his own dissent. \u00a9 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Published onMarch 26, 2025 I have been testing all kinds of power stations lately. The thing about these is that you really need to pick the right one for your needs. Some are very powerful but kind of expensive and large. Others are portable and affordable but not powerful enough. If you want something in the middle that is powerful enough to run most appliances but not too huge and expensive, today we have some really nice power station deals from Anker, Jackery, and DJI. Buy the Anker SOLIX C1000 Portable Power Station for $449 ($550 off) Buy the Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 Portable Power Station for $449 ($350 off) Buy the DJI Power 1000 Portable Power Station for $419 ($580 off) All of these offers are available from Amazon. They are labeled as \u201cBig Spring Deals.\u201d This sales event is ending on March 31, 2025, so we can only assume the prices will return to normal then. Anker is very popular in the power station market. Its products are capable and reliable, and customer service is among the best. That said, its products are usually also pricier than most of the competition. It\u2019s good to catch a deal on them, and this one is pretty nice, saving you 55% off the retail price. Remember, this is commonly a $999 power station, so it is pretty powerful. It has a 1,056Wh battery capacity. If you aren\u2019t sure what that means, it\u2019s enough juice to charge a phone about 92 times. Just to put things into perspective. This unit has a max output of\u00a0 1,800W and supports surge peaks of 2,400W. This means it can handle more powerful electronics, such as coffee makers, electric grills, fridges, and more. It can even power many drills, saws, and other power tools. The only way to reach the maximum watt output is through the AC outlets, which are one of the power station\u2019s highlights. It has six AC outlets! Even the much bigger and more expensive units don\u2019t always get these many AC outlets. Additionally, the power station comes with two USB-C ports, one with a 100W output and one with a 30W capacity. Then, there are two 12W USB-A connections and a car socket. Oh, and we can\u2019t forget the integrated light! It\u2019s a nice touch for campers or anyone who will be using the Anker SOLIX C1000 in the dark. A great thing about power stations is solar input support, and this one can take in up to 600W of solar panel charging. Jackery is another giant in the power station market. It was founded in 2012 and has made a name for itself in the industry since then. The brand is very respected and easily recognizable because of its unique orange accents. It\u2019s a safe bet to go with a Jackery power station, both because of quality and customer support. In this case, the Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 is pretty capable. It sports a 1,070Wh battery capacity, which is about the same as the Anker unit listed above. You will get a 1,500W output with support for 3,000W surges. While the stable max wattage is lower, that\u2019s still enough to power fridges, kettles, microwaves, and more. The port selection is the one downside of the Jackery Explorer 1000 V2, at least when compared to the Anker SOLIX C1000. This one comes with three AC outlets. It also has two USB-C ports, a 100W one and a 30W one. It also has a single 18W USB-A port and a car socket. If you want to charge it off the grid, this one supports up to 400W of solar panel input. Now, if you really want to save, and don\u2019t mind making some sacrifices while keeping about the same amount of power, the DJI Power 1000 Portable Power Station is a whopping $580 off, slashing the price to $419. It is the cheapest power station on this list, yet it still has a 1,024Wh battery capacity. The output is also very nice, at 2,200W, and it supports 2,600W peak surges. As mentioned above, that is more than enough to power most appliances, like refrigerators, microwaves, kettles, coffee makers, TVs, and more. Very few appliances need more than this. Port selection is a bit limited if you want to use AC outlets to get the maximum output. It only sports two of them. That said, this one has its benefits. Both USB-C ports can output 140W, which none of the other options above can do. The other two USB-A connections can reach 24W. Of course, DJI is all about its drones, and if you are too, that\u2019s where this power station has some benefits. This power station comes with SDC and SDC Lite ports, which can more efficiently power supported DJI products. They can also be used to include add-ons. And if you care for solar power, this one supports up to 800W in solar input. Remember, these are part of Amazon\u2019s \u201cBig Spring Deals,\u201d which are ending pretty soon. Not to mention, there is always a chance the stock will run out! You might want to get these deals soon if you\u2019ve made up your mind already.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"ByBernard Marr  ByBernard Marr,  Contributor.  Quantum computing is poised to revolutionize industries from drug development to cybersecurity, with ... More the global market projected to reach $15 billion by 2030. Quantum computers represent a breakthrough comparable to the move from valves to transistors in computer engineering. It doesn't just mean processing data faster; it means processing data in ways that redefine our understanding of what data is and what can be done with it. Nature, the world around us, the universe and the physical forces that make it all possible aren\u2019t digital in nature. So to get closer to understanding, modeling and predicting their vast, chaotic complexity, \u201cclassical\u201d binary computing won\u2019t ever be good enough. Enter quantum computing and its mind-bending ability to harness strange quantum properties, such as tunneling and superposition, in order to solve certain complex problems in seconds rather than eons. For example, classical computers are limited, due to their classical\u201d electronic architecture, to storing and processing data in \u201cbits\u201d of one or zero. This is because, fundamentally, their architecture consists of simply a huge number of on\/off switches. A quantum computer, on the other hand, stores and processes data as \"qubits\" \u2013 quantum bits that can, somewhat spookily, exist in both states simultaneously \u2013 as well as any of the infinite number of points in between them. Quantum computing is already being applied in drug and chemical research, material sciences, logistics, finance, cryptography and cybersecurity. Unlike the move from valves to transistors, quantum computers won\u2019t immediately replace today\u2019s \u201cclassical\u201d computers. Quantum computers will be reserved for specialist and niche applications that classical computers either wouldn\u2019t be able to handle or would take a literal age to complete. The global market for quantum computing services is predicted to grow to $15 billion by 2030 as early adopters get started. This will come from hardware, tools, applications, and cloud-based quantum-as-a-service. If you\u2019re wondering how it will affect your industry, business or profession, these are the key players you should be keeping up with: IBM IBM was an early pioneer in both valve and transistor-based computing, so it\u2019s no surprise that it\u2019s also pioneering quantum computing. It developed some of the first superconducting qubits and was also the first to offer quantum-as-a-service in the cloud. Last year, it launched the Condor chip, currently one of the most powerful quantum processors available, with over 1,000 qubits. Google Quantum AI The quantum development and commercialization arm of Alphabet has distinguished itself with breakthroughs including claiming the first \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d moment. This happened in 2010 when its 53-qubit Sycamore system solved a problem that wasn't thought to be possible with classical computer architecture. The claim was, however, retroactively annulled years later when a University Of Science And Technology Of China team showed that it actually could be done. In 2024, Google once again claimed they had achieved quantum supremacy with an updated 67-qubit Sycamore. Google\u2019s latest Willow quantum chips have 105 qubits but, more significantly, greatly improved error correction. This potentially overcomes problems around instability, which has so far limited the potential of quantum computing for some applications. Microsoft Azure Quantum Microsoft builds its latest quantum processors\u2014known as Majorana 1 \u2013 around a method of quantum computing known as topological qubits. This is another way of (theoretically) improving stability and making quantum accessible for a wider range of tasks. Utility-wise, its strategy, similar to Google, is to provide businesses and research organizations with a suite of cloud-based quantum tools through its Azure platform. University Of Science And Technology Of China A leading Chinese technology research center, USTC researchers are responsible for some of the most significant quantum computing breakthroughs to date. Notably in 2023, its Zuchongzhi-2 quantum computer completed the \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d task demonstrated by Googe\u2019s Sycamore in 2019 in just 20 seconds compared to Sycamore\u2019s 200 seconds. Its successor, Xuchongzhi-3, has just been unveiled, and with 105 qubits, it is believed to be one of the fastest quantum computers built so far. D-Wave Beginning as a Canadian research startup, D-Wave was one of the first groups to capitalize on the commercial implications of quantum computing. It launched the first commercially available quantum computer \u2013 D-Wave One \u2013 in 2011. D-Wave\u2019s approach to building quantum machines is slightly different, focusing on a technology called quantum annealing that's highly efficient for solving optimization problems. This is particularly significant for businesses because these solutions\u2014finding the most efficient routes for multi-drop drivers or the most effective combination of ingredients to make medicines\u2014can unlock big efficiencies. Intel Intel is known for chips, particularly processor chips, so as with other tech companies here, moving into quantum computing was a natural next step. Like Microsoft, Google and IBM, its involvement demonstrates how important big tech believes quantum computing will be in the future. Intel\u2019s quantum technology centers on its Tunnel Falls processor, which uses silicon spin qubits. These are built on classical semiconductor infrastructure, which is still far more scalable and cost-effective than other more exotic quantum technologies right now. Quantinuum Quantinuum was formed from a merger between Honeywell\u2019s quantum computing research division and Cambridge University-backed startup Cambridge Quantum. Although it has developed some of the most cutting-edge quantum computers, such as the first 56-qubit trapped-ion quantum processor in 2024, has also developed some of the most mature packages and platforms for enterprise. It offers combined hardware and software solutions and is focused on facilitating the move of quantum computing from research lab to industry. Rigetti Computing Rigetti focuses on delivering business-ready, hybrid classical\/quantum systems that customers can start using today rather than hitting theoretical goals like quantum supremacy. It takes the same conventional, superconducting-qubits approach to quantum computing engineering as big players like IBM and Google. This is because its strategy is to focus on reducing the time its customers take to start getting value from their investment in quantum computing. It delivered one of the first cloud quantum-as-a-service offerings, and customers include enterprises, government agencies and research organizations. China Telecom Quantum Group Another Chinese leader, CTQG, developed a 504-qubit quantum computer called Tianyan-504. In terms of qubits, this is the largest and most powerful quantum computer China has produced so far. Developed in partnership with the Chinese Academy Of Sciences, it will be integrated into Tianyan\u2019s quantum cloud platform to provide quantum-as-a-service to its customers. CTQG also acquired QuantumCTek, an early Chinese quantum computing pioneer distinguished for its work in quantum communications and security, and has developed commercial services around these capabilities. IonQ Another quantum-native startup that\u2019s found big-time success in the emerging market for quantum services is IonQ. It has pioneered a quantum computing technology known as trapped-ion, which uses super-stable atoms suspended in electromagnetic fields as qubits. Because they are isolated from other atoms, they remain coherent for longer, resulting in fewer errors. This makes it particularly suited for high-precision simulations needed in many quantum-friendly tasks such as financial modeling and drug discovery. Are You Quantum Ready? So, not everyone needs to use quantum computers right away. Their enormous power and relatively high expense mean that classical computers will still be sufficient for many everyday computing tasks for the foreseeable future. However, businesses, industries, and professionals working in fields where quantum computing will make a difference can\u2019t afford to overlook the opportunity. Staying up to speed with developments, including the latest moves by the key players mentioned here, is critical for anyone who doesn\u2019t want to get left behind.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-26","content":" \t\t\t\t\tBy Dade Hayes  Business Editor  Advertising firm Magna, part of media giant Interpublic, has trimmed its 2025 forecast due to recent declines in consumer confidence.  \tThe new outlook calls for growth of 4.3%, down from a prior expectation of 4.9%. Excluding cyclical events like the election and the Olympics, Magna is now looking for 6.7% growth, down from 7.3%. Digital ads will remain strong, posting high-single-digit gains, while legacy categories like linear TV are expected to stagnate.  \tIn part, the adjustment also reflects difficult comparisons with 2025. U.S. ad sales hit $380 billion last year, with the growth rate of 12.4% the highest of any year in the past two-and-a-half decades except for the 2021 rebound from Covid.   \t            \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t \t              \tNews \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tAd-Supported Streaming Tiers Gain Traction, FAST Fascinates Gen Z And Millennial Viewers - Study\t\t \t\t\t                \tNews \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tYouTube Brandcast Regulars Like MrBeast And Dude Perfect Slated For Separate Creator Upfront\t\t \t\t\t        \tEven after the reduction, Magna called its updated numbers \u201cstill solid by historical standards.\u201d     \t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t       \tThe firm issues a report at the start of each year, laying out key targets, and then provides periodic updates and tweaks to the numbers.  \tVincent L\u00e9tang, EVP, Global Market Intelligence at Magna and co-author of the updated report, said \u201cmost economic fundamentals\u201d are still healthy. \u201cHowever, confidence plays a crucial role in marketing and advertising investment decisions. The current \u2013 hopefully temporary \u2013 dip in confidence has already dampened the dynamics of the ad market, prompting us to revise our growth forecast.\u201d  \tDuring the first quarter of the year, which will come to an end on Monday, consumers have been confronted by a flurry of announcements about tariffs, which in turn have rattled financial markets. Amid the stock market gyrations and stubbornly elevated inflation levels, the Conference Board reported Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9. That marks four consecutive months of decline and the lowest figure since January 2021.\u00a0  \tTech giants like Google, Meta, Amazon and Spotify as a group will post advertising gains of 9.6%, reaching $293 billion, Magna said in its revised report. Traditional media companies, whose portfolios include television, premium long-form streaming, audio, publishing, out-of-home and cinema advertising, \u201cmay face challenges in this uncertain environment,\u201d the firm cautions. Traditional companies will collectively register a drop of 1% this year, settling at $103 billion in revenue, Magna projects.  \t           \tCross-platform national TV sales (linear plus streaming) are expected to remain stable at around $46 billion, as continued growth in ad-supported streaming (+14%), helps offset a decline in linear viewing and ad sales (-7%).

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Business Insider Edition  Barclays slashed its Samp;P 500 target to the lowest among the major banks, predicting that the index will end the year at 5,900.          Before Wednesday, the firm held a 6,600 target but cut its outlook amid deteriorating economic data and tariff disruptions, which have paralyzed markets so far this year.               RBC and Goldman Sachs have also downgraded their price targets this month, they expect the S&P to reach 6,200 \u2014 implying a record high by year-end. Meanwhile, Citi and HSBC this month downgraded their outlooks of US stocks to \"neutral\" without slashing price targets.                Barclays' outlook suggests that the index has already peaked this year. The 5,900 target would deliver a meager 0.3% gain for the year.                \"Our base case assumes that earnings take a hit as tariffs (higher China tariffs stick but do not escalate, reciprocal tariffs amount to 5% on RoW) contribute to material slowing in US activity that nonetheless stops short of outright recession, allowing valuations to gradually recover (60% probability),\" Barclays analysts wrote on Wednesday.               The Trump administration has made tariffs the centerpiece of its trade policy. Since taking office, duties on imports have kicked in on good from China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union. President Donald Trump has said reciprocal tariffs will begin on April 2, and the president announced new auto tariffs would be unveiled on Wednesday.               Barclays expects Chinese and reciprocal tariffs to drag S&P 500 earnings per share down 1.6%. If countries retaliate with their own duties \u2014 as has already happened \u2014 earnings would fall another 0.7%.               Earnings growth is the biggest driver of stock market gains. Barclays has repeatedly warned about a drag on EPS from escalating tariffs and warned in December that a full-blown trade war would slash EPS by 2.8%.               But the scope and severity of the White House tariffs will matter. If Trump walks back tariffs, S&P 500 valuations could surge.               \"However, in our bear case, the full impact of Canada and Mexico tariffs, in tandem with reciprocal and China tariffs, creates a much larger direct drag on SPX EPS growth, with second-order effects likely pushing US GDP into contraction and the S&P 500 into a bear market down to 4400,\" Barlays said, citing 15% odds of this outcome.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Dollar Tree (DLTR) said Wednesday that it would sell its Family Dollar business to a pair of private equity firms for $1 billion, a fraction of the amount it paid for the struggling unit several years ago.  Brigade Capital Management and Macelleum Capital Management are the two firms set to buy the budget retailer. Macelleum has led acquisition investor campaigns at Bed, Bath & Beyond and Kohl\u2019s (KSS). Dollar Tree originally paid $9 billion to acquire the 65-year-old business in 2015. The company has struggled to grow Family Dollar, announcing in 2024 that it would close some 1,000 locations as inflation, retail theft, and other issues took a toll. In June, Dollar Tree had said it would review whether to sell or spin off the brand.  \u201cThis is a major milestone in our multi-year transformation journey to help us fully achieve our potential,\u201d Dollar Tree CEO Mike Creedon said in a statement. \u201cUnder the experienced, dynamic leadership of Family Dollar President Jason Nordin, and with the financial support of Brigade and Macellum, Family Dollar will be well-positioned for growth as a private company,\u201d he added.  Dollar Tree shares rose as much as 7% in pre-market trading, before paring back some of those gains. The stock is currently up almost 4%.  On Wednesday, the discount retailer also posted net sales of $5 billion from its fourth quarter, which ended on Feb. 1, a small increase from $4.96 billion last year. That\u2019s excluding sales from Family Dollar stores. Dollar Tree expects 2025 net sales from its continuing operations to be in the range of $18.5 billion and $19.1 billion. The company expected first-quarter 2025 sales to be between $4.5 billion and $4.6 billion, based on same-store sales growth of between 3% and 5%. It forecasts adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $1.10 and $1.25.  Full-year earnings will be hit by between 30 cents and 35 cents per share, due to costs associated with maintaining Family Dollar\u2019s operations, according to the company. Its forecast for adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at between $5 and $5.50. The proposed sale is subject to regulatory approval. The company said it is expected to close during the second quarter of 2025. The sale is expected to deliver net proceeds of about $804 million with the economic impact of tax benefits from losses on the sale reaching $350 million, Dollar Tree said.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"Business Insider Edition  The US exceptionalism trade looks likely to persist, despite fears that America's stock market dominance is waning as international stocks outperform the Samp;P 500 this year.          That's according to Goldman Sachs, which highlighted a key advantage American companies have over their international peers: returns on investment in research and development and other areas meant to grow their business.               David Kostin, the chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, highlighted that firms within the S&P 500 had a growth investment ratio nearly double that of other global equity markets.               Those staggering research and development costs can unlock significant growth down the road.               \"The Growth Investment Ratio is greater in the US (42%) than Rest of World (26%) and the gap has been steadily widening in recent years,\" Kostin said.               Kostin calculates the growth investment ratio by adding growth capex, which is capital expenditures less depreciation, to R&D costs as a share of cash flow from operations.               In addition, the return on investment for US-based companies is higher than that of their international peers, at 80% compared with 73%.               In other words, American companies are investing more in their future and getting a better return on their investments than their overseas peers.               That's key to continuing the American exceptionalism trade, as the US continues to lead in the biggest industries and in cutting-edge technologies, including AI, quantum computing, and biotech research.               \"Maintaining US equity market exceptionalism will require both the magnitude of growth investment and the returns on those investments to remain elevated during the next several years,\" Kostin said.               The call from Goldman Sachs contrasts with other Wall Street firms that are worried about the economic impact of President Donald Trump's uncertain trade policies.               Earlier this month, Citi strategists recommended that investors take profits in US stocks and load up on Chinese stocks because of the expected unraveling of the US exceptionalism trade.               But Morgan Stanley also noted this week that a resurgence of US tech stocks could ultimately pave the way for a refresh of US stock market dominance.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"YouTube Music is adding flexibility to its relatively fresh AI \u201cradio\u201d feature. You can now tune your \u201cAsk Music\u201d stations to align better with your interests. This is just one of the new features coming to iOS. First introduced last year as a quasi-alternative to Spotify\u2019s AI Playlist feature, \u201cAsk Music\u201d lets you create custom playlists or \u201cradio\u201d stations by typing or speaking what you\u2019d like to hear. From there, YouTube Music will generate playlists based on moods, genres, activities, or descriptions. You can save the generated playlists to your library. Now, there are also follow-up prompts. For example, using Ask Music, I\u2019m looking for \u201cfun songs for a Wednesday afternoon.\u201d Follow-up prompts include \u201conly pop stars,\u201d \u201cenergetic indie rock,\u201d and more. Currently, Ask Music is limited to YouTube Music Premium users on Android and iOS in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland. As noted by 9to5Google, YouTube Music is also introducing new \u201cMy Mix\u201d titles generated by Gemini, Google\u2019s AI assistant. These titles aim to capture the overall mood of personalized playlists better. Previously, these mixes were only identified by numbers. With this upgrade, they will now have more descriptive names that reflect the genre and artists included in each blend. \u201cMy Mix\u201d is available exclusively to YouTube Premium and YouTube Music Premium subscribers, in the U.S. only. Its algorithmically generated playlists are tailored to individual music tastes, drawing from users\u2019 listening history, liked songs, and overall activity within YouTube Music. Finally, YouTube Music is expanding the topics that are available when you use AI to generate custom playlist artwork. Workout and Instruments themes have been added to Colors, Cycles, Travel, Moods, Nature, Animals, Landscapes, Food and Drinks, and Fantasy. The music streaming market in the U.S. is primarily dominated by Spotify and Apple Music, with Amazon Music and YouTube Music following closely behind. YouTube Music, in particular, is gaining popularity due to its unique combination of music and music videos. It\u2019s encouraging to see new features being added to the service. When it comes to watching videos on the internet, YouTube remains the most common place to do it. It's been around since 2005, delivering a hub for video content and includes everything from the newest music videos, to live-streaming events. While the website itself is free to use, its filled with ads that have a tendency to interrupt your videos at the worst possible time. However, with YouTube Premium you can eliminate those pesky ads, and get back to watching the content you want to see -- without interruptions. The YouTube family of products can be a bit confusing, however. In addition to YouTube Premium, there are other paid services like YouTube Music, YouTube TV, and the now-defunct YouTube Go, plus some free movies on YouTube you don't want to miss. The price of YouTube Premium has changes since launch, and with new services like YouTube Premium Lite, its worth considering which option is right for you. There are even bundling options that could save you some money like the YouTube Premium family plan, or the free trial. Remember when Netflix\u00a0was just a mail-order DVD service? Now that VOD platforms all but rule the world, every big entertainment brand is striving for its shot at streaming stardom. With new apps and services landing regularly, it can be hard to tell what platforms to pay attention to. But heed our words, friends: trust in YouTube TV.\u00a0 Similar to Hulu Plus Live TV, Sling TV, Fubo, and DirecTV Stream, YouTube TV offers linear and on-demand YouTube movies and shows. There are several other perks to enjoy too, and we\u2019ve broken everything down in this complete guide to YouTube TV. Bose has added a new set of noise-canceling wireless earbuds to its lineup, and they're surprisingly affordable at $179. Simply known as the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, the company says they're for folks who want everyday earbuds with great sound and noise cancellation. The new model comes in three colors (black, white, and lilac) and can be ordered starting September 18 at . Bose's QuietComfort lineup of noise-canceling wireless earbuds have traditionally been pretty expensive, with prices that exceed what Apple, Sony, and Sennheiser charge for similar features. This makes the QuietComfort Earbuds something of a radical departure for the company and a welcome change for Bose fans. \r Please enable Javascript to view this content  Upgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"You might think you don\u2019t need a hearing aid, and you might be right. But in general, hearing loss eventually comes to all of us. In fact, you progressively lose hearing every year, which is why kids can have high-pitched ringtones their parents can\u2019t hear. You\u2019d think hearing aids would be pretty simple, right? After all, we know how to pick up sounds, amplify them, and play them back. But there\u2019s a lot more to it. Hearing aids need to be small, comfortable, have great battery life, and cram a microphone and speaker into a small area. That also can lead to problems with feedback, which can be very uncomfortable for the user. In addition, they need to handle very soft and loud sounds and accommodate devices like telephones. Although early hearing aids just made sound louder and, possibly, blocked unwanted sound, modern devices will try to increase volume only in certain bands where the user has hearing loss. They may also employ sophisticated methods to block or reduce noise. Hearing loss is nothing new. Ear trumpets appeared around the 17th century. These were just simple sound baffles that directed sound to your ear and, perhaps, cut some noise out that wasn\u2019t in the trumpet\u2019s direction. The modern hearing aid dates back to the akouphone in 1895. [Miller Hutchison] developed the device for a friend who was deaf from a bout of scarlet fever. It was bulky \u2014 sitting on a table top \u2014 and used a carbon microphone, but it did work. He was also able to sell several models to royalty, many of whom suffered from hereditary deafness. This included Denmark\u2019s Queen Alexandra, who, reportedly, was very impressed with the results. Around 1902, [Hutchison] changed the device\u2019s name to the acousticon, making it more portable with battery power. Despite impressive marketing, not all medical professionals were sold. If you were totally deaf, the device did nothing, unsurprisingly. In addition, the bulky batteries required frequent replacement, and the frequency response was poor. It was still better than nothing, and the invention also led to the massacon and akoulalion that converted sound into vibration for the profoundly deaf. He later sold the rights for the acousticon to [Kelley Turner], who would not only improve the device, but also use the technology to launch the dictograph, which was a well-known office machine for many years.  The Zenith Miniature 75 (photo by [France1978] CC-BY-SA-2.0).Amplified hearing aids appeared around 1913, but they were still large boxes. By 1920, the vactuphone used vacuum tubes to perform amplification. At \u201conly\u201d seven pounds, the vactuphone was considered quite portable. Keep in mind that portable hearing aids in the 1920s was a relative term. Typically, you\u2019d have a unit carried in a bag or hung around your neck. World War II brought advances in minaturization which benefited hearing aids like the Zenith Miniature 75. Transistors, of course, changed everything, including hearing aids. The Sonotone 1010, which appeared in 1952, used both transistors and tubes. Early transistor units were known to fail early due to moisture and heat. Silicon transistors and encapsulation helped. Naturally, all of these hearing aids were analog as were the earliest IC-based devices. However, with the advent of ICs, it was possible to use digital techniques. The path to digital hearing aids was difficult. In the 1970s, large computers could program digital elements in hearing aids to tune the device to set frequency bands and gains. By 1980, several groups were experimenting with real digital hearing aids, although many of them had wireless links to real computers. A fully digital hearing aid first appeared in a 1984 patent, but it wasn\u2019t tiny. Since then, things have gotten smaller and more capable. Hearing aids went from table-top devices, to boxes hanging on necks. Getting smaller devices allowed for small boxes that hug the back of the ear with the earpiece into the ear canal. With even smaller devices, the entire apparatus can be placed in the ear canal. Many of these go so deeply into the ear that they are largely invisible. There are also hearing aids that can surgically attach to your skull using a titanium post embedded in the bone. This can transmit sound even to people who can\u2019t hear sound directly since it relies on bone conduction. Other places to find hearing aids are built into thick glasses frames. Doctors with hearing problems can opt for stethoscopes with integrated hearing aids. Modern hearing aids sometimes have rechargeable batteries. Otherwise, there will be some kind of small battery. There was a time that mercury cells were common, but with those banned in most places, many aids now take zinc-air batteries that deliver about 1.4 V. We hear from an 8th grader that you can make hearing aid batteries last longer by peeling the sticker from them and waiting five minutes before installing them. Apparently, giving them a little time to mix with the air helps them. On the market today are hearing aids that use neural networks, have Bluetooth connections, and use other high tech tricks.\u00a0We\u2019ve looked at the insides of a hearing aid and why they cost so much before. If you want to roll your own, there is an open source design. British comedian Eric Sykes often appeared on TV and in films wearing glasses with no lenses \u2013 that\u2019s because he became profoundly deaf as an adult and his glasses fames contained an early bone-conducting hearing aid. Fun story and not questioning its truth, but just want to mention that a lot of people on TV wear glasses with no lenses.  Glare. They were his trademark almost as much as the Two Ronnies whose into featured a graphic of two pairs of glasses. I\u2019m not sure but I think he might also have coined the gag where he pretends to be cleaning his glasses then passes the cloth right through the frame where the lens should be, he was a master of comedy especially slapstick so it would absolutely fit. Another innovation to modern hearing aids is frequency spectrum compression. When a patient has lost either high frequency or low frequency perception the range they have lost is combined with a segment of their remaining perceivable range  and then compressed so the entirety of the resulting waveform falls within the patients hearing range. That\u2019s really cool! I never knew this Sorry if my words were unclear. Not all modern hearing aids can\/do this. I should have made it clear that its a treatment modality some newer digital processors allow for specific forms of hearing loss. I wonder if it could be done all analog. Seems like it would sound a bit like single-sideband tuned off frequency a little. Yes. That was my first HA design, many years ago. But did not work around any appreciable ambient noise. Next design was based on PJRC\u2019s Teensy 3. Got another hearing test, then did another desing using  the Teensy 3.6, which I still use.  The PJRC audio libraries, plus a little analog signal conditioning, made it a relatively easy design and implementation. The difficult part was finding decent microphones and ear speakers. The only thing that you cannot reliably DIY is your personal audiometry tests. The online stuff is not useful quantitatively, but is a qualitative measure of your freq response. The down-side? I can clearly hear my wife. Every last word. That\u2019s very interesting but wouldn\u2019t the frequency compression cause the sound to \u201csound\u201d different? Does the patient have a learning curve to use this type of hearing aid or what? yes the sound does sound different I am most familiar with this being used in reverse slope hearing loss, or low frequency hearing loss. Frequencies below 2000 hz, mens voices, bass notes, and natural or mechanical rumbling sounds. Hearing these sounds shifted to the 2000-2500hz range is better than not hearing them at all. There isnt really an adjustment, your brain doesnt learn to hear these with the original deepness. I guess the learning is to not laugh at burly men sounding like theyve been huffing helium. Not a learning curve per se, but it does take adjusting on some level. I had mine re-calibrated a couple times before i got fully comfortable with wearing it every day, and i do believe it was partially my brain adapting to being able to perceive these frequencies. Then if youre like me and used to only include one ear in your everyday \u201chearing\u201d (i.e. intuitively turning your better ear to whoever is talking to you, for example) that kind of stuff also takes unlearning. :)) As another commenter said though its all much better than not hearing. What happens when listening to music?  Wouldn\u2019t that cause dissonance?  If so, could the original sounds be shifted into a harmonic? Fun fact: early ceramic microphones used in hearing aids manufactured in Poland during 1980s were produced by the same company, which made infamous brown toilet bowls used in schools and at railway stations. Those bowls were made from brown phyanse ceramic because it didn\u2019t require white enamel and didn\u2019t have to be cleaned so often \u2013 the so called soviet \u201crationalization\u201d policy. soooo\u2026 \u2018it\u2019s not a skid mark if we get the contrast right\u2019 was the design pitch? I suspect it was more of \u2018it isn\u2019t rust\u2019 (if your pipes are rusty and your tank is leaking a bit \u2013 you get white toilet bowl  \u201crusty-colored\u201d in surprisingly little amount of time. When I read the title I was thinking about HIV and how it can be made audible. Then I realized that this makes no sense and that \u201caids\u201d is plural for aid. \ud83d\ude05 Sounds like you should get aides. One sentence: NDA. that would be an acronym not a sentence, in fact it doesnt even represent a sentence but rather merely a noun phrase That would be an initialism, not acronym One word: cryptic I have two words for you: BRUSH YOUR TEETH! There\u2019s a lot of tech to nerd over in hearing aids. Specifically the \u201cloop\u201d radio transmission support for public venues, and it\u2019s imminent replacement; Auracast (bluetooth LE broadcasts). I\u2019ve been experimenting with all the Auracast devices I can get my hands on, but it\u2019s still very early. I\u2019d love to find an open source project that uses something like an esp32 and a bluetooth 5.4 transmitter to create an Auracast relay for public venues. Eventually anyone with hearing aids will be prompted by their phones if they\u2019d like to join a public broadcast when they enter an Airport or sporting event. Finally they\u2019ll have digital audio quality and adoption will be higher than loop ever was, because most bluetooth 5.4+ devices will support it. Couple that with realtime AI translation and it\u2019s going to make public events more accessible for everyone. Or it will have advertisements ;-) Considering that loop radio transmission is harder to set up In the US, it was illegal to sell hearing ads to consumers without a doctor\u2019s prescription until 2017. After over-the-counter hearing aids became legal, prices quickly dropped from hundreds of dollars to tens of dollars. In the early 70\u2019s I had a stereo battery portable cassette and wanted to record live sound. I read up on binaural and spaced omni mics. I attached a pair of spaced cheapo mics to the heavy Koss phones kinda like martian antennae. Within the front hemisphere location of a voice was very good, it fell apart in the whole rear. The rear quadrant for us poor in life. I had a close friend who was somewhat deaf from birth. I let him use the bulky but wearable setup where he could crank it up and balance it for his weak ear and he delighted at what he could hear in 3D. The tech of the time was out of reach and low fidelity. Oh! Nobody would wear headphones in public, so it didn\u2019t mater. I listened to the Watergate hearings on my \u201cwalkman\u201d whilst biking, and wanted to see a pocket stereo cassette player in \u201971. \u201cIn fact, you progressively lose hearing every year, which is why kids can have high-pitched ringtones their parents can\u2019t hear.\u201d I\u2019m sorry, could you type louder, I can\u2019t hear you. One of the true tragedies that anyone with a grandparent can tell you is that hearing decline and cognitive decline often go hand in hand. Denial of hearing loss is a real thing. My dream is that inexpensive technology for hearing loss will be mainstream and accepted my those with even minor hearing loss early, before the cognitive decline really sets in. There is almost nothing worse or more exhausting than shouting at a family member that refuses to believe (simply cannot believe) they are deaf AF. And iffn\u2019 you finally get them hearing aids they can\u2019t tell the difference anyway because they are so cooked otherwise. Thank you for a really interesting article. I have been wearing hearing aids for 6 years now and they have been life-transforming and also allowed me to keep working. Mine use bluetooth to connect to my phone and ipad, so I can use them for telephone calls, music, audiobooks, movies, etc. Crowded rooms are still a nightmare. This from Apple.com which has also been reported in Australia newspapers,  at least \u201cThe Age\u201d and probably others. Apple introduces AirPods 4 and the world\u2019s first all-in-one hearing health experience with AirPods Pro 2 The new AirPods lineup includes a brand-new design for AirPods 4, a new array of colors for AirPods Max, and revolutionary Hearing Protection, Hearing Test, and Hearing Aid features for AirPods Pro 2 \u201cPatent drawing from 1984 \u2014 Hardly portable\u201d This is not  the hearing aid but a setup for measuring the  patient\u2019s hearing parameters. This is what happens when they have daily article quota to fill. Can\u2019t produce enough quality content on time so they use JennyGPT. The evolution of technology is awesome. But what hearing aids really need is cost reduction. There\u2019s so many predators feasting off the handicapped. My Cochlear BAHA cost as much as a decent used car. \u201cWe hear from an 8th grader that you can make hearing aid batteries last longer by peeling the sticker from them and waiting five minutes before installing them. Apparently, giving them a little time to mix with the air helps them.\u201d My pack of hearing batteries from Boots even includes this instruction on the package, but they only state one minute. I should try 5 minutes next time. Thanks to that curious 14 year old for this observation. So, one 14yo makes one observation and claim, and that echoes around the world. Typical social mudia [sic]. Let\u2019s try some critical thinking\u2026 The air will enter whether or not the cell is installed \u2013 so what\u2019s the physics\/chemistry that would support the observation and claim? What is the control group? Battery capacity varies between brands and over age, so what evidence is there that isn\u2019t a sufficient cause of the observation and claim? It\u2019s possible that drawing current from the battery immediately after it is exposed to air reduces the capacity. We need a controlled study. I have Jabra aids from Costco.  They do help with mild loss, but focus on conversations and in restaurants is just plain hype.  The hardware is compact with long battery life.  The software sucks \u2013 randomly drops streaming, nagware, must wait several seconds to connect and do anything,  ineffective three point equalizer, no compressor to lower peaks and boost low volume sounds.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"A conversation with former Marvel head Peter Cuneo on what it takes to shake up a team or organization. When a company, division, or product line has been struggling for some time, it can feel nearly impossible to get things back on track. But big turnarounds are possible, provided you have a team willing to work hard, be creative, and embrace change.\u00a0When he was\u00a0president and CEO of Marvel,\u00a0Peter Cuneo\u00a0oversaw the resurgence and sale of the media company, but even before that he had a long track record for turning around many types of consumer-facing businesses. He shares the strategies that work best for shaking up organizations and teams and boosting their performance. Cuneo is also the managing principal of Cuneo and Company. Key episode topics include: strategy execution, strategic planning, strategy, turnarounds, decision-making, problem solving, entertainment industry HBR On Strategy curates the best and conversations and case studies with the world\u2019s top business and management experts, to help you unlock new ways of doing business. New episodes every week. HANNAH BATES: Welcome to HBR On Strategy\u2014case studies and conversations with the world\u2019s top business and management experts, hand-selected to help you unlock new ways of doing business. Welcome to HBR On Strategy\u2014case studies and conversations with the world\u2019s top business and management experts, hand-selected to help you unlock new ways of doing business. Turning around a struggling business can feel impossible. But Peter Cuneo has proved that it\u2019s not. During his tenure as CEO of Marvel Entertainment\u2014yes, that Marvel of the comic books and superhero movies\u2014he led the bankrupt company\u00a0 to massive success. And he orchestrated similar turnarounds at Black & Decker, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Remington. Cuneo spoke with Alison Beard on HBR IdeaCast in August 2024 about his strategic management style, and how you can apply the lessons he\u2019s learned. Here he is, telling her how he decides if a company or project is even worth saving: PETER CUNEO: Well, I\u2019ve been asked to get involved in a lot of companies that were having problems, and I probably only chose one out of five because it\u2019s difficult. What I try to do is find people who know the company inside to talk to them about what\u2019s going on. What are they hearing? I have found in my turnarounds actually that the most important thing and the thing that was wrong, that was, I like to say, bankrupt, even if they weren\u2019t bankrupt financially, what was bankrupt was the culture of the company. The value system was, in some cases, shockingly wrong. What the company, what the organization, what the employees thought was important to accomplish, and what really was important. And so, always try to kind of attack that first question. The second thing, of course, are the things you can do yourself. There\u2019s looking at an industry, there\u2019s looking at the opportunities for the company within that industry, or even what\u2019s the life cycle of the whole industry. You always assume when you\u2019re going into turnarounds, you are going to make a lot of change. And I always tell people now, \u201cNo matter how much information you get being outside the company, when you get inside on a turnaround, if you know it\u2019s a turnaround, you\u2019re going to find out that it\u2019s always much worse than you thought it was. So be prepared for lots of negative surprises, even on top of the ones you already knew about before you walked through the front door.\u201d ALISON BEARD: But in your evaluation, you have to see a path forward because of the product or the people or the company\u2019s position in the market. PETER CUNEO: Broadly speaking, you can see that, but in the end, it\u2019s all about execution. It\u2019s all about the people. It\u2019s all about having employees, particularly in key positions, that can cope with a turnaround. My experience is that most human beings have a very hard time being inside a turnaround because it\u2019s scary. You don\u2019t know what the future is. And it takes a certain type of person that will be comfortable with that risk, usually because they see what the rewards could be, particularly financially. But it takes a unique kind of person with a unique view of the world and themselves to actually engage in a turnaround on purpose. I think you have to know yourself, be comfortable with that environment. ALISON BEARD: So it seems like you\u2019re saying personnel is a huge piece of executing the turnaround. You\u2019ve managed comebacks for everything from personal care products at Clairol to security hardware at Black & Decker, to international divisions at Remington, to movies at Marvel. Are there universal sort of strategies that you pursue for all of those cases, or does each situation require its own specific solution? PETER CUNEO: On my podcast, I feature something I call the 32 Essentials of Superhero Leadership, and these are one-liners about leadership, about philosophy, behavior, instinct, what have you, that I\u2019ve learned in my career. Many of them, I have to say, the hard way. One of them I actually say is never think you\u2019ve seen it all before because every situation is largely different. Sure, there are certain things you\u2019re going to want to do naturally. For example, the first week I would be in a new turnaround, I would ask all of my direct reports to prepare a one-pager, if you will, on the following, what was wrong with the company, who made the mistakes, and what would they do going forward if they were me? And the one about who was at fault, I put in specifically for a reason because I could pretty much tell right away who were the keepers and who wouldn\u2019t work out long term. So if a person came in, and this would happen, saying, \u201cHere are our problems, I could have done this better, and here\u2019s where I think we can really go,\u201d that was someone I was interested in working with. If someone came in and said, \u201cAll the problems were someone else. My organization, I didn\u2019t make any mistakes, etc.,\u201d I pretty much thought they wouldn\u2019t make the cut long. And that\u2019s generally how it worked out. So right away, I am, if you will, designing who will be on the key team that\u2019s going to run this turnaround and places where I\u2019ll need to find other people from outside the company. It\u2019s usually a melding of both. You will find people inside an organization who are actually quite good and, for reasons of poor leadership in the past, basically were never allowed to flourish. And once they are allowed to flourish, they really show their stuff. \u00a0One of the great pleasures I\u2019ve had, actually, I\u2019ve done seven successful turnarounds, is seeing that happen. ALISON BEARD: And what about financial leavers better managing resources versus strategic \u2013 heading in a different direction? PETER CUNEO: Obviously, if you\u2019re doing a turnaround, what the numbers are and so on are very important. And I always like to be initially very close to the numbers because if you\u2019re going into an industry that you don\u2019t really know, you can\u2019t pretend to yourself that you\u2019re an instant expert. When I went to Marvel, I had no idea how to make a motion picture. I had no idea how to publish a comic book, so I needed to learn the key points of those as quickly as I can. And actually, Marvel is a New York Stock Exchange-listed company, obviously public, and the CFO of the company, when I came, really had his doubts that the company could make it. We\u2019d just come out of bankruptcy. Stock price was super low, and he left the company, and I became the CFO as well as the CEO. Now, today, because of Sarbanes-Oxley, you could never get away with this on a public company, but back then played both roles for two years before I really felt the turnaround was well underway. That\u2019s one of the reasons I learned to understand the makings of making comic books and motion pictures. ALISON BEARD: As you\u2019re thinking about new strategic directions that you want to take, a division or an international group or an entire organization, do you look closely at what successful competitors are doing? PETER CUNEO: When I go to a turnaround, I have only the vaguest macro notion of what the strategic decisions or future directions could be. Again, I know that I\u2019m going to discover things that I don\u2019t know on the outside, and in fact, I might be pleasantly surprised or not. And so I don\u2019t get too wedded to what I think what my vision might be for the company. I\u2019m not pushing my vision very hard to start. I want to learn to make sure I know what I\u2019m talking about, and that takes a little bit of time. And very often, I\u2019ve adopted other people\u2019s vision. Here\u2019s an example at Marvel again. At Marvel, actually, somebody else, a guy named Avi Arad, had really started the motion picture, if you will, strategic approach for the company\u2019s characters. When I showed up the first month I was on the job, I went to the set of X-Men 1. It was already filming. It was the first film that launched Marvel all those years ago on all the success that Marvel has had with film and other businesses. And so I was on the set after two weeks on the job. I admit it. I had no idea, and I was not about to make changes in the script or anything else because I would be the essence of arrogance to say to myself, suddenly, I know how to make a good movie. Pushing movies in our own studio rather than with big studio partners was not me. It\u2019s a guy named David Maisel. And David had a vision, and the more I heard about it and the more I saw, the more I got excited about his vision. And so, eventually, we made history. ALISON BEARD: And as you work with this team of people that have been there who have good ideas and are energized by the prospect of change and new people that you\u2019ve brought in to think about strategic directions, do you think that turnaround efforts have more success when there is sort of close attention paid to the competition and how to do what competitors are doing better or differently or more efficiently? Or is it really more about thinking outside the box toward those kind of blue ocean opportunities? PETER CUNEO: Well, actually you can do both. You certainly want to know a lot about your competition a lot. Understand their behavior, want to understand how they think, you want to understand their cultures as well. But you can do that and take advantage of that at the same time that you\u2019re thinking about radical approaches to the industry or to the business. It\u2019s not an either, or in this case. And I think they\u2019re both extremely important. They\u2019re required actually to affect a turnaround. I was typically on my turnarounds on the job for three years. ALISON BEARD: Three years is a really quick turnaround time. So how do you manage to do it that quickly, given the hurdles that you outlined? Natural resistance to change, for example. PETER CUNEO: One of the things that I think many poor leaders misunderstand is the value of communications. Now, we could say, \u201cOh, of course communications are important, right.\u201d Everyone would say that, but it\u2019s really the quality of the communications that matter. It\u2019s the quality. It\u2019s how often you communicate. It\u2019s how consistently you communicate. It\u2019s also communicating to big groups. If you have a multinational business, you\u2019re going to have to do some of that certainly. But it\u2019s also walking the aisles, just talking to people about their\u2026 how the day is going and talk to them about the business. And believe me, anything you say to that one individual is going to get all around the company in an hour. You have to be consistent, willing to talk. People would rather hear bad news than no news. That\u2019s human nature, believe it or not. That\u2019s what I have found. I had many different ways that I like to communicate, and you may laugh, but one of them was pizza parties. So I would have every week\u2026 ALISON BEARD: I like pizza. I\u2019m not going to laugh at that. PETER CUNEO: Every week or every other week, I would have a pizza lunch for maybe 12 people from the company, and they were at all levels and in all functional areas. And one of the interesting things that I found very often is even though they\u2019re in the same building, maybe even in the same floor when we went around the room introducing ourselves, a lot of the people didn\u2019t know the other people in the room, which told me something again about culture right away. And so this gave me the opportunity to talk about the business, of course, to be optimistic, and you always have to be. In turnarounds, your body language has to be optimistic, what you say has to be optimistic, and so on. And there\u2019s no room for being down ever publicly. If things aren\u2019t going well, you can go home and scream in a pillow. That\u2019s cool. I won\u2019t say that I haven\u2019t done it, but you\u2019re on stage. You\u2019re literally on stage. And even in the case of bad news, you have to be projecting a positive image and optimism, and that you do\u2026 one of the ways you do it. Of course, it\u2019s through effective communications. ALISON BEARD: Is it possible for an existing leader of an underperforming team or product line or business to execute a turnaround also, or does it take an outsider? PETER CUNEO: I think it depends on what kind of turnaround is required. If you\u2019re talking about radical turnarounds, I think it\u2019s very hard for existing leadership to achieve it because they\u2019re wedded to the past. And radical turns, all mine have been radical, I would say. I think you\u2019re going to have to have a different leadership team. One of the turnarounds I did I always think about this, I came in, and usually, the people I\u2019m replacing are no longer with the company. They\u2019re not physically there. But in this particular case, the individual was still there, and he was actually very cordial. He\u2019d been with the company for 30 years, and he had been the CEO for like 15 years. A long time. And he said to me, \u201cPeter, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201d And, of course, I was thinking, there\u2019s no way that he\u2019s happy that I\u2019m here. And he said, \u201cYou\u2019ll make the changes I couldn\u2019t.\u201d And he said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t fire my friends.\u201d It had all become a family to him with all the time he\u2019d been there, and he couldn\u2019t make the hard actions that he knew he had to make because change always upsets human beings. Even, quote, good change. ALISON BEARD: And when you\u2019re overseeing painful change like that, you\u2019re shifting resources from one area to another, you\u2019re perhaps laying off people, you\u2019re cutting costs, how do you get buy-in? How do you keep people still feeling positive? PETER CUNEO: So I\u2019d love to tell you, I\u2019m so wonderful, and I walk through the door, and two weeks later, every employee in a multinational company is on board. Of course, that\u2019s ridiculous. You\u2019re going to have people who challenge you, who don\u2019t believe in your vision, for example, or won\u2019t believe in all the changes that you\u2019re making. And that\u2019s okay. Typically, I give people time, but after a couple of months, if they can\u2019t make the trip with me, frankly, they have to go because they become cancers in the organization. And the organization has to have a single purpose, a single goal, if you will, in mind. So there are times to be very, very tough, and you can\u2019t be afraid to do that. Most human beings do not aspire to leadership simply because they know that they\u2019re going to have to make difficult decisions and changes, and they\u2019re going to be unpopular, and they just don\u2019t want to ever be in a position to be unpopular to hurt other people. And that\u2019s cool. I often say that I think that I\u2019m the outlier. People like me we\u2019re the outliers. I don\u2019t say\u2026 I don\u2019t mean that we\u2019re insensitive. I think that we\u2019re actually very sensitive, but we\u2019re able, for whatever reason, to go ahead and make those changes and believe in them and give people hope. It\u2019s actually better for an organization. Everyone\u2019s worried when you walk in the door, \u201cAm I going to lose my job?\u201d And that\u2019s appropriate. It\u2019s better to make those changes fast and then be able to say to the organization, in your communications, there will be no more personnel changes because then they can really start to think about, \u201cOkay, am I on board or not now that I know I have a job?\u201d Good leaders are, I think, excellent at feeling at the instincts of human behavior, human nature, and being able to cope with those and sometimes even use them. But it\u2019s very important. You have to get the company to a point where everyone\u2019s going to roll the boat in unison. ALISON BEARD: So you\u2019re obviously most well-known for the Marvel turnaround, and I\u2019d love to talk about one big decision that helped pave the way for that. You, along with the Marvel board, agreed to green light Robert Downey Jr. to play Iron Man at a time when his public perception really wasn\u2019t the best. Why was that move so important? How did you know that was the right thing to do? PETER CUNEO: So I mentioned starting Marvel Studios, and the\u2026 I\u2019m now vice chairman of the board. We had, by the way, a very strong board at Marvel. And this is something, again, you\u2019re at a public company or a private turnaround, you want to make sure you have a great board. The board members there deserve a lot of credit for the success because they were believers in radical change, and they could see it and they could support it. Most boards, they don\u2019t want to do anything radical. And so we had started Marvel Studios, and the first film we were going to make is Iron Man 1. And this is going to be very important because we have borrowed $525 million to start this studio. And this first film obviously needs to be a hit. And, of course, the big decision who\u2019s going to play the lead character? Tony Stark. And we\u2019re having a board meeting in New York, and the people running Marvel Studios come in, and they say, \u201cWell, we have someone we really want to cast. We\u2019ve worked a lot with him, and we think he\u2019s ideally the best male actor in Hollywood. We want to cast Robert Downey Jr.\u201d And there\u2019s this silence in the room since his mugshot had been all over everywhere two or three months earlier. And Robert clearly had some personal issues, that\u2019s for sure. And so, to the credit of the people running Marvel Studios, they had gotten him to screen test, and they said, \u201cWe knew you would react this way,\u201d he\u2019d said to the board. \u201cAnd understandable. But we want to show you his screen test.\u201d So the screen test was the first, I think, eight or 10 minutes of the actual movie. He\u2019s in the Humvee with a female Army driver. He\u2019s smoking a cigarette. He\u2019s drinking a cocktail in the backseat like nothing\u2019s going on. And, of course, they get hit, and that\u2019s how he gets a new heart, and he\u2019s captured and whatever. But first eight minutes are just in the vehicle, and he\u2019s on script for the first three or four minutes. And then Robert, as only Robert can do, I have to say, looking back, goes off, and he becomes Tony Stark just in front of us. That film came out in 2007. So we are now 17 years later, the culture of Marvel had become, and I started it, but a lot of other people jumped on board, we\u2019re going to change the rules of the game. We\u2019re not going to make movies the way other people do. We\u2019re not going to do comic books the way other people do. That was the culture. If you want to wrap it up in one line, change the rules of the game. And this was a good example of changing the rules of the game, casting Robert and he was brilliant in the movie. ALISON BEARD: Over the course of your career, why do you think that you gravitated toward these challenges\/opportunities, especially when companies were near bankruptcy or in bankruptcy like Remington or Marvel when you know you\u2019re going to have to make really difficult changes? Why is that all of that appealing? PETER CUNEO: That\u2019s a great question, which I\u2019ve asked myself many times over the years. I think it starts with how I was raised. Three of my four grandparents were immigrants, so they were risk-takers in a sense. We don\u2019t really think about it anymore, but way back in the late 19th century, to leave your country and come to a completely different country, particularly when you didn\u2019t speak the language, which was true in some cases, not all my grandparents, but in some cases, and make a life for yourself takes a lot of courage and it takes a willingness to put up change. And my mother and my father were, I think, because they\u2019re the spawn of my grandparents, were very similar. Real quickly, my father was Boy Scout of the year at age 13 in Manhattan; was a Navy officer in World War II in the South Pacific and also was pulled\u2026 called up from the reserves to be an officer on an aircraft carrier in the Korean War. He was also a lieutenant in New York City Fire Department, running into buildings, fighting fires in some of the worst neighborhoods in New York. So my father was a doer. He could not handle a desk job for very long. He needed to get out there. And my mother was similar. My mother was an EMT for 30 years. And so I grew up with those as models for life. And so I was never afraid of the unknown. In fact, in a funny way, I gravitated. I used to tell people I had an adventurer gene. And then, I volunteered to go to Vietnam. I did two tours as a Navy officer in Vietnam, another adventure. I was very naive. I wouldn\u2019t call it an adventure anymore. But that started me on a leadership\u2026 on a pattern of leadership because the military gives young junior officers a tremendous amount of responsibility during wartimes. And so I had to cope and live with that. I actually enjoyed it. And so that\u2019s the start. And then, of course, when I got out of the Navy, I went to Harvard Business School. Actually, I had no idea that I would be good in turnarounds and no clue at all. Never thought about turnarounds. I was doing a fairly big corporate financial type of professional career, and one day, I was in a division in consumer products. My boss said to me, \u201cYou\u2019re taking over the international division.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat? Yeah, we\u2019re getting on a plane. We\u2019re flying to London to the headquarters tomorrow.\u201d So I was thrown into my first turnaround, and I didn\u2019t move. I stayed in New York, but I was quite often in Europe. And the first six months, I was very down. I really didn\u2019t think, \u201cWhat do I know about turnarounds?\u201d And then we started to get results, and then we got really good results. And then I started to think about, \u201cWhy is it? Why are we successful?\u201d And I realized it was leadership, not just mine, but other people that I had found or discovered in the organization or brought into the organization. And then I was off. And then the company I was with saw what I had done after two years and said, \u201cOkay, here\u2019s a bigger turnaround to do.\u201d And we had a big success there too. And then I was addicted. I was actually, I have to say, addicted to doing turnarounds. I think I still am today. The reality is I had a lot of help, and I made some mistakes, and there is stress. Nobody can\u2026 tells you that I did a successful turnaround. It\u2019s going to tell you if they\u2019re honest, that there wasn\u2019t a lot of stress because there is. Particularly for me in the first six months when I was still making changes in learning mode and what have you. And if my wife was here, she would tell you that on most of them, there were times when I came back home in the first six months and said, \u201cI think I made a major career blunder.\u201d It wasn\u2019t instant. And in some cases, if anything, they were even worse for a while. So there is that too. Another reason that I don\u2019t recommend turnarounds for everyone. ALISON BEARD: So let\u2019s talk about when you feel like your mission has been accomplished and it\u2019s time to move on. I know you\u2019ve sold a couple companies. Remington to a leveraged buyout firm. Marvel to Disney in 2009. How do you make those decisions? When do you know it\u2019s time to step away? PETER CUNEO: Well, as I said, most of the time, I\u2019m in the job three years. At Marvel, it was closer to four years as CEO, and I didn\u2019t make the decision to sell the business six years later. That was obviously a board decision. Also, the owners of Remington, when we sold the business, that was\u2026 certainly, they were a big part of that. But as far as me being done, actually, there\u2019s a very simple test. I start to get bored. Things seem to be running well. We\u2019re getting good results. People seem to be happy. There aren\u2019t the big challenges that there were when I first came, and that\u2019s when I know it\u2019s probably time to move on. ALISON BEARD: What\u2019s your advice to leaders out there who feel like the businesses that they\u2019re managing might be in trouble? PETER CUNEO: Well, when you say might be in trouble, I think it\u2019s rarely a question. ALISON BEARD: So if you think it might be, it probably is. PETER CUNEO: Yeah, it\u2019s probably, I would say. And so, again, leadership, great leadership takes courage. It takes being honest with yourself and with others and courage to make change and upset others. I would say to most people to determine whether you\u2019re the person who can do it. Do you have the personality, the emotional makeup, to actually carry it off? Because if you\u2019re honest and you\u2019re not, then get somebody else who will. And you\u2019ll still get the credit for the turnaround because you brought in the person who was successful. In some cases, maybe you don\u2019t have that option. It\u2019s time for to look for another job. But human beings want to procrastinate. My biggest plus and my biggest minus is I\u2019m too impatient as a personality. But tor turnarounds, you got to get\u2026 you got to move. You got to get help. And if you\u2019re in a situation where you\u2019re involved in an area you just know nothing about, like I knew nothing about comics or movies, but maybe it could be today \u2013 AI. Everybody\u2019s going to be engaged with AI in some way. If you don\u2019t understand AI, get someone to help you understand it. And that\u2019s not hard. It\u2019s not hard. But if your competition is into AI already and you\u2019re not, you have a problem. And it\u2019s an obvious one, but don\u2019t be afraid to get help. ALISON BEARD: I think that\u2019s good advice, a growth mindset, courage to act. Peter, thank you so much for talking with me today. PETER CUNEO: Alison has been my pleasure. Thank you for having me.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"The stock market recovery from concerns about a possible tariff-induced trade war may be fragile, cautioned multiple Wall Street firms, as investors look to navigate the challenging macroeconomic backdrop while stock prices swing wildly based on the often shifting tone of President Donald Trump on levies. Barclays strategists slashed their S&P 500 price target by more than 10% Wednesday, citing the ... More potential for tariffs to cause a \u201cmaterial slowing\u201d in economic activity. Up more than 4% from its March 13 bottom, the bellwether S&P 500 will attempt Wednesday its first four-day winning streak in more than two months. The recent jump traces back to indications Trump\u2019s most expansive set of tariffs coming next week \u201cwouldn\u2019t be as bad as previously feared,\u201d Deutsche Bank strategist Henry Allen explained in a Wednesday note to clients. However, \u201crisks lean toward an initial tariff announcement that negatively surprises markets,\u201d according to Goldman Sachs economist Alec Phillips. Trump\u2019s heavily teased reciprocal tariffs will likely be lofty as a negotiation tactic, explained Phillips, nodding to the Canada and Mexico levies \u201cwhich twice involved a steep tariff rate that was rescinded mostly or entirely after a few days.\u201d In a Wednesday note, UBS strategist Maxwell Grinacoff expressed his \u201cconcerns of renewed weakness\u201d in the stock market unless \u201cpolicy uncertainty abates,\u201d explaining this uncertainty could cause a broader slowdown in the economy, and as a consequence in corporate earnings. And in perhaps the most dramatic Wall Street reaction to the latest tariff ado, Barclays strategists slashed their end-of-year price target for the S&P by more than 10%, from 6,600 to 5,900, predicting \u201cearnings take a hit as tariffs contribute to material slowing in U.S. activity.\u201d Barclays\u2019 S&P target is the lowest on Wall Street, according to CNBC, though it still calls for about a 2% gain from the index\u2019s roughly 5,780 level Wednesday. \u201cInvestors are now very focused on the April 2nd reciprocal tariff deadline,\u201d Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael Wilson proclaimed in a Monday note. Trump declares April 2 will be \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d the date on which he would unveil his most impactful trade policy yet, reciprocal tariffs, which by definition would slap the same levies on imports that the equivalent American goods face when brought into that country. Reciprocal tariffs are far more complex in practice though \u2013 UBS economists estimate such a case-by-case policy would require 2.5 million separate tariff rates \u2013 and the Trump administration has recently shown much more interest in targeting a handful of trade partners it believes has shortchanged the U.S. on trade. Trump has struck a far less hawkish stance on trade over the last few days, saying there will be \u201cflexibility\u201d on reciprocal tariffs, the levies will be \u201cnicer\u201d than previously thought and the April 2 actions will be \u201cmore lenient than reciprocal.\u201d The uncertainty surrounding tariffs, which some economists warn could tip the U.S. into a recession at the most extreme scenarios floated by Trump, have eaten into consumer confidence, as the Conference Board\u2019s measure fell this month to its lowest level since February 2021. Even after the latest rebound, the S&P is down 4.1% since Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration. At this point of Trump\u2019s first term, the index was up 3.2%, excluding dividends.   One Community.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":" \u0394 A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.  \u0394 This story is part of the Grist series Unearthed: The Mining Issue, which examines the global race to extract critical minerals for the clean energy transition. It was supported by the Pulitzer Center, produced by Grist, and co-published with Wired. Greenland\u2019s massive cap of ice, containing enough fresh water to raise sea levels by 23 feet, is in serious trouble. Between 2002 and 2023, Greenland lost\u00a0270 billion tons\u00a0of frozen water each year as winter snowfall failed to compensate for ever-fiercer summer temperatures. That\u2019s a significant contributor of sea level rise globally, which is now at a\u00a0quarter of an inch\u00a0a year. But underneath all that melting ice is something the whole world wants: the rare earth elements that make modern society \u2014 and the clean energy revolution \u2014 possible. That could soon turn Greenland, which has a population size similar to that of Casper, Wyoming, into a mining mecca.\u00a0 Greenland\u2019s dominant industry has long been fishing, but its government is now looking to diversify its economy. While the island has opened up a handful of mines, like for gold and rubies, its built and natural environment makes drilling a nightmare \u2014 freezing conditions on remote sites without railways or highways for access. The country\u2019s rich reserves of rare earths and geopolitical conflict, however, are making the island look increasingly enticing to mining companies, Arctic conditions be damned. When President Donald Trump talks about the United States acquiring Greenland, it\u2019s partly for its strategic trade and military location in the Arctic, but also for its mineral resources. According to one Greenland official, the island \u201cpossesses 39 of the 50 minerals that the United States has classified as critical to national security and economic stability.\u201d While the island, an autonomous territory of Denmark, has made clear it is not for sale, its government is signaling it is open to business, particularly in the minerals sector. Earlier this month, Greenland\u2019s elections saw the ascendance of the pro-business Demokraatit Party, which has promised to accelerate the development of the country\u2019s minerals and other resources. At the same time, the party\u2019s leadership is pushing back hard against Trump\u2019s rhetoric. Rare earth elements are fundamental to daily life: These words you are reading on a screen are made of the ones and zeroes of binary code. But they\u2019re also made of rare earth elements, such as the terbium in LED screens, praseodymium in batteries, and neodymium in a phone\u2019s vibration unit. Depending on where you live, the electricity powering this screen may have even come from the dysprosium in wind turbines.\u00a0 These minerals helped build the modern world \u2014 and will be in increasing demand going forward. \u201cThey sit at the heart of pretty much every electric vehicle, cruise missile, advanced magnet,\u201d said Adam Lajeunesse, a public policy expert at Canada\u2019s St. Francis Xavier University. \u201cAll of these different minerals are absolutely required to build almost everything that we do in our high-tech environment.\u201d To the increasing alarm of Western powers, China now has a stranglehold on the market for rare earth elements, responsible for 70 percent of production globally. As the renewables revolution unfolds, and as more EVs hit the road, the world will demand ever more of these metals: Between 2020 and 2022, the total value of rare earths used in the energy transition each year quadrupled. That is projected to go up another tenfold by 2035. According to the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre, by 2030, Greenland could provide nearly 10,000 tons of rare earth oxides to the global economy.\u00a0 One way to meet that demand, and for the world to diversify control over the rare earths market and speed up clean energy adoption, is to mine in Greenland. (In other words, the way to avoid future ice melt may, ironically, mean capitalizing on the riches revealed by climate-driven ice loss.) On the land currently exposed along the island\u2019s edges, mining companies are starting to drill, and the U.S. doesn\u2019t want to be left out of the action.\u00a0 But anyone gung-ho on immediately turning Greenland into a rare earths bonanza is in for a rude awakening. More so than elsewhere on the planet, mining the island is an extremely complicated, and lengthy, proposition \u2014 logistically, geopolitically, and economically. And most importantly for the people of Greenland, mining of any kind comes with inevitable environmental consequences, like pollution and disruptions to wildlife. The Trump administration\u2019s aggressive language has spooked Indigenous Greenlanders in particular, who make up 90 percent of the population and have endured a long history of brutal colonization, from deadly waves of disease and displacement to forced sterilization. \u201cIt\u2019s been a shock for Greenland,\u201d said Aqqaluk Lynge, former president of the Inuit Circumpolar Council and co-founder of Greenland\u2019s Inuit Ataqatigiit political party. \u201cThey are looking at us as people that you just can throw out.\u201d Lacking the resources to directly invest in mining for rare earths, the Greenland government is approving licenses for exploration. \u201cWe have all the critical minerals. Everyone wants them,\u201d said J\u00f8rgen T. Hammeken-Holm, permanent secretary for mineral resources in the Greenland government. \u201cThe geology is so exciting, but there are a lot of \u2018buts.\u2019\u201d The funny thing about rare earth elements is that they\u2019re not particularly rare. Planet Earth is loaded with them \u2014 only in an annoyingly distributed manner. Miners have to process a lot of rock to pluck out small amounts of praseodymium, neodymium, and the 15 other rare earth elements. That makes the minerals very difficult and dirty to mine and then refine: For every ton of rare earths dug up, 2,000 tons of toxic waste are generated. China\u2019s government cornered the market on rare earths by both subsidizing the industry and streamlining regulations. \u201cIf you can purchase something from a Chinese company which does not have the same labor regulations, human rights considerations, environmental considerations as you would in Australia or California, you\u2019ll buy it more cheaply on the Chinese market,\u201d Lajeunesse said. Many critical minerals that are mined elsewhere in the world still go back to China, because the country has spent decades building up its refining capacity. China has used the rare earths market as an economic and political weapon. In 2010, the so-called Rare Earths Trade Dispute broke out, when China refused to ship the minerals to Japan \u2014 a country famous for its manufacturing of technologies. (However, some researchers question whether this was a deliberate embargo or a Chinese effort to reduce rare earth exports generally.) More subtly, China can manipulate the market on rare earths by, say, increasing production to drive down prices. This makes it less economically feasible for other mining outfits to get into the game, given the cost and difficulty of extracting the minerals, solidifying China\u2019s grip on rare earths.\u00a0 \u201cThey control every stage \u2014 the mining of it, and then the intermediate processing, and then the more sophisticated final product processing,\u201d said Heather Exner-Pirot, director of energy, natural resources, and environment at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, a think tank in Canada. \u201cSo they can intervene in the market at all these levels.\u201d This is a precarious monopoly for Western economies and governments to navigate. Military aircraft and drones use permanent magnets made of terbium and dysprosium. Medical imaging equipment also relies on rare earths, as do flatscreens and electric motors. It\u2019s not just the energy transition that needs a steady supply of these minerals, but modern life itself. As a result, all eyes are turning toward Greenland\u2019s rich deposits of rare earths. The island contains 18 percent of the global reserves for neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium, according to the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre. Even a decade ago, scientists reported that the island could meet a quarter of the global demand for rare earths. The question is whether mining companies can overcome the headaches inherent in extracting rare earths from Greenland\u2019s ice-free yet still frigid edges. An outfit would have to ship in all their equipment and build their own city at a remote mining site at considerable cost. On top of that, it would be difficult to actually hire enough workers from the island\u2019s population of laborers, so a mining company may need to hire internationally and bring them in. Greenland has a population of 57,000, just 65 of whom were involved in mining as of 2020, so the requisite experience just isn\u2019t there. \u201cLabor laws are much more strict than they would be in a Chinese rare earth mine in Mongolia,\u201d Lajeunesse said. \u201cAll of those things factor together to make Arctic development very expensive.\u201d Still, the geopolitical pressure from China\u2019s domination of the rare earths market has opened Greenland to exploration. No one needs to wait for further deterioration of the island\u2019s ice sheet to get to work, as there\u2019s enough ice-free land along these edges to dig through. Around 40 mining companies have exploration, prospecting, and exploitation licenses in Greenland, with the majority of the firms based in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. \u201cWe can give you these minerals,\u201d Hammeken-Holm said, \u201cbut you need to come to Greenland and do the exploration.\u201d One of those companies is Critical Metals Corp., which in September drilled 14 holes on the coast of southern Greenland, about 16 miles from the town of Qaqortoq. The New York-based company says it\u2019s found one of the world\u2019s highest concentrations of gallium, which isn\u2019t technically a rare earth element but is still essential in the manufacturing of computer chips. Dramatic change on and around the island, though, could make mining for rare earths even more complicated. While the loss of floating ice in the waters around the island makes it easier and safer for ships to navigate, more chunks of glaciers will drop into the ocean as the world warms, which could become especially hazardous for ships, \u00e0 la the Titanic.\u00a0 Even given the rapid loss of Greenland\u2019s 650,000-square-mile ice sheet, though, it would take a long while to lose it all \u2014 it\u2019s 1.4 miles thick on average. The Earth itself is also frozen in parts of the island, known as permafrost, which will thaw in the nearer term as temperatures rise. \u201cThat's going to give you certainly instability in terms of building access roads and such,\u201d said Paul Bierman, a geologist at the University of Vermont and author of the book When the Ice Is Gone: What a Greenland Ice Core Reveals About Earth's Tumultuous History and Perilous Future. \u201cThe climate is changing, so I think it's going to be a very dynamic environment in which to extract minerals.\u201d\u00a0 Related Stories Related Story Related Story Related Story Related Story Mining pollution, too, is a major concern: The accessible land along the island\u2019s ice-free edges is also where humans live. As mining equipment and ships burn fossil fuels, they produce black carbon. When this settles on ice, it darkens the surface, which then absorbs more sunlight \u2014 think of how much hotter you get wearing a black shirt than a white shirt on a summer day. This could further accelerate the melting of Greenland\u2019s precarious ice sheet. A 2022 study also found that three legacy mines in Greenland heavily polluted the local environment with metals, like lead and zinc, due to the lack of environmental studies and regulation prior to the 1970s. But it also found no significant pollution at mines established in the last 20 years.\u00a0 A more immediate problem with mining is the potentially toxic dust generated by so much machinery, said Niels Henrik Hooge, a campaigner at NOAH, the Danish chapter of the environmental organization Friends of the Earth. \u201cThat's a concern, because all the mining projects are located in areas where people live, or potentially could live,\u201d Hooge said. \u201cEverything is a bit different in the Arctic, because the environment does not recover very quickly when polluted.\u201d Lynge says that a win-win for Greenlanders would be to support mining but insist that it\u2019s run on hydropower instead of fossil fuels. The island has huge potential for hydropower, and indeed has been approving more projects and expanding another existing facility. Still, no amount of hydropower can negate the impact of mining on the landscape. \u201cThere's no sustainable mining in the world,\u201d Lynge said. \u201cThe question is if we can do it a little bit better.\u201d Critical Metals Corp., for its part, says that it expects to produce minimal harmful products at its site. Like other mining projects in Greenland, it will need to pass an environmental review. \u201cWe expect to provide more updates about our plans to reduce our environmental footprint as we get closer to mining operations,\u201d said Tony Sage, the company\u2019s CEO and executive chairman, in a statement provided to Grist. \u201cWith that, we believe it is important to keep in mind that rare earth elements are critical materials for cleaner applications, which will help us build a greener planet in the future.\u201d\u00a0 Still, wherever there\u2019s mining activity, there\u2019s potential for spills. There\u2019s also potential for a lot of noise: Ships in particular fill the ocean around Greenland with a din that can stress and disorient fishes and marine mammals, like narwhals, seals, and whales. For vocalizing species, it can disrupt their communication.\u00a0 There\u2019s a lot at stake here economically and politically, too: Fishing is Greenland\u2019s predominant industry, accounting for 95 percent of the island\u2019s exports. Rare earth mining, then, is the island\u2019s play to diversify its economy, which could help it wean off the subsidies it gets from the Danish government. That, in turn, could help it win independence. Thus far, the mining business has been a bit rocky in Greenland. In 2021, the government banned uranium mining, halting the development of a project by the Australian outfit Greenland Minerals, which would have also produced rare earths at the site. (Greenland Minerals did not respond to multiple requests to comment for this story.) The China-linked company is now suing the Greenland government for $11 billion \u2014 potentially spooking other would-be prospectors and the investors already worried about the profitability of mining for rare earths in the far north. \u201cWhen we talk to them, they understand the situation, and they're not afraid,\u201d said Hammeken-Holm. He added that Greenland maintains a dialogue with mining outfits about the challenges, and prospects, of exploration. \u201cIt is difficult to get private finance for these projects, but we are not alone,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's a worldwide situation.\u201d The growing demand and geopolitical fervor around rare earths may well make Greenland irresistible for mining companies, regardless of the logistical challenges. Hammeken-Holm says that a major discovery, like an especially rich deposit of a given rare earth element, might be the extra boost the country needs to transform itself into an indispensable provider of the critical minerals. Both Exner-Pirot, of the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, and Lajeunesse, the public policy expert, say that Western powers might get to the point where they intervene aggressively in the market. Like China\u2019s state-sponsored rare earths industry, the U.S., Canada, Australia, or the European Union \u2014 which entered into a strategic partnership with Greenland in 2023 to develop critical raw materials \u2014 might band together to guarantee a steady flow of the minerals that make modern militaries, consumerism, and the energy transition possible. Subsidies, for instance, would help make the industry more profitable \u2014 and palatable for investors. \u201cYou'd have to accept that you're purchasing and developing minerals for more than the market price,\u201d Lajeunesse said. \u201cBut over the long term, it's about developing a security of supply.\u201d Already a land of rapid climatological change, Greenland could soon grow richer \u2014 and more powerful on the world stage. Ton by ton, its disappearing ice will reveal more of the mineral solutions to the world\u2019s woes. Tom Vaillant contributed research and reporting.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"ByKira Golenko  ByKira Golenko,  Forbes Councils Member.  Kira Golenko, Founder and CEO of Motko. Kira is an expert on tennis, well-being and real estate.    From the wellness market reaching a record $6.8 trillion in 2024 to a growing public health push for prevention, health and wellness are hotter than ever. What is less hot: Class B offices and outdated multifamily properties, struggling to fill occupancy and maintain rents. In a world where we spend over 90% of our time indoors, could the wellness boom revive both tired bodies and underperforming properties? Wellness as a concept is multifaceted, and I find that a data-driven approach can help property owners develop a strategic, high-ROI wellness program. MIT\u2019s study on the financial impact of healthy buildings found that certified healthy buildings command between 4.4% and 7.7% higher rents per square foot and longer lease terms. Based on this, I think a wellness-focused strategy can be a key competitive differentiator for older buildings. However, every property is unique, so the right wellness strategy must align with location, existing conditions and market demand. It\u2019s also important to recognize that not all wellness features are perceived equally. For example, tenants may not immediately recognize the benefits of cleaner air, yet research suggests it\u2019s important for long-term health and cognitive function. Similarly, the most financially viable wellness upgrades depend on cost-effective implementation strategies tailored to the asset class. In the U.S., certain wellness-focused features may not only enhance tenants\u2019 health outcomes but also help them meet local property laws and qualify for state-enabled financing programs. This allows property owners to implement upgrades with no upfront capital investment while improving tenant retention and net operating income (NOI). Below, I want to explore three wellness-driven strategies that can help improve health outcomes while adding financial value to your real estate investments. Who doesn\u2019t love being in nature? Nature makes people feel better\u2014science backs it. But while doctors in Canada are now prescribing forest walks as preventative medicine, most people don\u2019t have the luxury of escaping into the wilderness. This is where biophilic design comes in. Biophilic and active design principles have tangible benefits, not only for occupant well-being but also for financial performance, for tenants increasingly prioritize healthy, experiential environments. For example, Interface\u2019s offices in Paris, featuring biophilic design and holistic well-being concepts, reported increases in employee well-being of 43% and productivity gains of 38%. Active design has similar attributes. Take attractive staircases\u2014wide, open staircases with natural light and appealing aesthetics, which can encourage more people to use the stairs, reducing elevator congestion and lowering energy costs. And besides, you never know who you might bump into on the stairs. A study focused on Arbor House, a residential building in the South Bronx designed with active principles, found that after one year of residency, there was a 53% decrease in the number of people who reported not walking up any flights of stairs per week. Similarly, active rooftop spaces can help to drive rental premiums. While not every property can match Google\u2019s London HQ \u201clandscraper\u201d rooftop park, installing sound systems, designing workspaces and integrating workout areas can drive tenant engagement. Engaging with others and being part of a community are key reasons people choose one property over another. And technology is reshaping how tenants interact with their environments. A well-designed digital community platform is more than just a communication tool\u2014it drives engagement, builds social capital within a property and enhances the overall tenant experience. Moreover, it is suitable across all asset classes and building ages, making it one of the most versatile wellness-driven enhancements. When done right, I\u2019ve seen how tech-driven engagement can reduce turnover, increasing long-term property value. For example, a digital platform can serve as a centralized communication hub for your property, allowing you to organize events, share updates, foster social connections and enable ongoing engagement. In commercial real estate, 92% of landlords acknowledge that tenants expect more from their buildings\u2014especially in terms of engagement and technology. Rather than viewing technology as a convenience add-on, I think it can be helpful to consider how wellness-driven tech can increase a building\u2019s competitive edge and align with shifting tenant expectations. By integrating smart technology, landlords can foster a sense of belonging, increase retention and differentiate their properties in a competitive market. Every building has a story, and tenant amenities help shape and share it. The best amenities create an experience, not just fill the space. And given how much consumers spend on wellness, they should be wellness-oriented. What is your property\u2019s edge? Is it art? Maybe proximity to a cultural attraction? Do you have the best taco pop-up on the roof? Do you have a theater that could host sports gatherings or Sunday football games? How about a pickleball simulator\u2014one of the fastest-growing sports in the U.S.? The key is to design the offerings with both wellness trends and financial returns. As buildings age and tenant expectations evolve, those who prioritize well-being, experience and engagement will be best positioned to lead the market. I believe the most successful repositioning strategies will be those that align wellness, financial sustainability and tenant demand, turning underperforming buildings into high-value, experience-driven assets.

{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"ByJohn Tamny  ByJohn Tamny,  Contributor.  There are over 10,000 McDonald\u2019s stores in Europe. That\u2019s a feature of this symbol of American capitalism, but also potentially a bug not just for McDonald\u2019s, but every American business with a large European footprint. The challenges are legislative and regulatory. For background, last week the European Commission (EC) accused Google of gearing its search results to the betterment of services offered by Google, not to mention that Apple is suffering EU legislation meant to boost access to its operating systems for third-party developers on the European continent. From the McDonald\u2019s example that this opinion piece opens with, it\u2019s easy to see the legislative and regulatory problems that world-renowned U.S. businesses face outside of the U.S. Really, what European corporation in the food or food adjacent space doesn\u2019t look in the proverbial mirror and see itself as a major supplier to McDonald\u2019s? At 10,000 stores (and counting), a supplier or product specific relationship with McDonald\u2019s represents the difference between a small business and a rapidly growing one with global ambitions. The global store count for McDonald\u2019s exceeds 44,000. Which brings us back to Google. Accused of favoring its own services in search results by the EC, Google finds itself in a difficult situation. Users the world over have made it a noun, verb, and adjective precisely because they so overwhelmingly favor Google\u2019s search engine. By extension, for Google to alter the fruits of its search results would be for Google to step on what makes its search engine so popular to begin with. All of which requires more thought about Google as a brand. It can lay claim to a substantial global user base precisely because it\u2019s Google, the noun, the verb, and the adjective. Which means the prominence of its services at the top of Google search results is a logical effect of its search engine prominently existing as the default pathway for those logging onto the internet each day. Which means a failure by Google to prominently feature itself in user searches would bring harm to Google twice: what favors its services also favors the Google user utilizing the search engine. That the EC and European businesses perhaps find fault with Google conducting business that favors itself (and by extension those who choose its search engine both voluntarily and overwhelmingly) isn\u2019t surprising. See McDonald\u2019s again. Really, what business wouldn\u2019t dream to feature prominently in any Google search result? In answering the above question, we can then see the difficulties Apple is experiencing with the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act (DMA). The Act \u201crequires major platform holders or \u2018gatekeepers\u2019 like Apple to provide third-party developers equal access to iOS and iPadOS system tools and features.\u201d Well, of course. To say that Apple is presently the world\u2019s most prominent provider of cutting-edge technological products brings new meaning to understatement. That it is explains the clamor of European businesses seeking interoperability with Apple products. Sorry, but it\u2019s McDonald\u2019s all over again: really, what European corporation in the technology or technology adjacent space doesn\u2019t look in the proverbial mirror and see its products capably interacting with those of Apple, and even better, enhancing them? But as with all businesses, how they see themselves versus how they\u2019re perceived by the world\u2019s greatest businesses is logically, and frequently, at odds. Importantly, the above-mentioned disparity looms as a major European threat to world-leading businesses that are frequently American. European legislators and regulators are trying to force outcomes that wouldn\u2019t otherwise reveal themselves in a free-market setting. For the sake of U.S. businesses and European customers of those businesses, the excesses of European legislators and regulators must be reined in.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-26","content":"ByShimon Shkury  ByShimon Shkury,  Contributor.  Apartment buildings line Manhattan's First Avenue. New York City\u2019s multifamily sales totaled $8.9 billion in 2024, a 14% increase in dollar volume from 2023, according to Ariel Property Advisors\u2019 Multifamily Year in Review New York City 2024. Transactions rose 4% year-over-year to 1,107. Citywide, predominantly free market buildings accounted for 63% of the multifamily dollar volume and 48% of the transaction volume in 2024, followed by predominantly rent stabilized assets, which accounted for 29% of the dollar volume and 47% of the transactions. The remaining sales were for buildings with regulatory agreements. New York City\u2019s multifamily market recorded $8.9 billion in sales in 2024, a 14% increase from 2023. Manhattan\u2019s multifamily volume reached $3.44 billion in 2024, an 11% annual increase, while Brooklyn\u2019s surged to $3.48 billion, a 59% rise. This growth in both boroughs was largely driven by free market sales, which comprised 76% of the dollar volume in each market. Attractive pricing was a key factor in free market sales in 2024, particularly in Manhattan. For example, Canvas Investment Partners acquired 210-220 E 22nd Street for $104.5 million, 15% below its 2015 sale price of $123 million. Other factors included strong fundamentals\u2014Manhattan rents have risen over 20% in the past three years and nearly 4% in the last year alone because of the lack of supply\u2014mortgage maturities and prime locations. The free market multifamily sector in New York City continues to attract a diverse group of investors, including private individuals, institutional firms (like Carlyle, Stockbridge and Stonehenge) and international buyers. Lenders are also actively involved, providing capital for investments in this asset class. This broad pool of investors and readily available capital indicates strong interest and confidence in the free market multifamily market. Select firms investing in free market multifamily properties in New York City. Conversely, the rent-stabilized multifamily sector in New York City remains under stress. Values for rent stabilized buildings have dropped around 35-60% below their 2017-2018 peak as owners continue to struggle under the weight of rising expenses combined with the 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act, which capped rents. My partner Victor Sozio, who was a recent guest on my Coffee & Cap Rates podcast, observed that many rent stabilized assets have extremely high leverage from loans that were placed either pre-HSTPA or in a market that had much lower interest rates. Now these assets are suffering from increased expenses, including rising insurance costs, and are also struggling with collections. Rent stabilized sales in 2024 accounted for 53% of the Bronx\u2019s multifamily dollar volume, which plummeted 59% year-over-year to $457.9 million; 51% of the multifamily dollar volume in Northern Manhattan, which saw a slight 7% year-over-year increase in volume to $674.5 million; and 72% of the dollar volume in Queens, which saw volume rise 13% year-over-year to $851.4 million. According to Sozio, many owners of rent stabilized buildings are actually eager to sell and move on from their investments. However, they are in a difficult position. The financial performance of these properties isn't strong enough to cover their loans, preventing them from selling. Sozio added that unless they get some sort of relief or cooperation from their lenders in many cases, they won't be able to transact. \u201cHopefully that's a trend that we're starting to see where lenders will be more pragmatic and open to these types of discussions to facilitate an exit even if it amounts to a short sale or some sort of modification or discounted payoff,\u201d he said. Discounted pricing is attracting buyers to the rent stabilized asset class. Investors in rent stabilized buildings continue to be primarily family offices and private individuals drawn by the drop in valuations and belief that the current regulations are unsustainable. With long-term strategies in mind, these buyers often acquire properties using all cash or minimal leverage, banking on potential regulatory changes in the future.   \u201cYou can make a pretty strong argument that it's a very intriguing buying opportunity in New York City today in this asset class in particular based on where it was historically, \u201c Sozio said. \u201cWe're seeing asking prices at 7% plus cap rates in many cases for these rent stabilized assets.\u201d Sozio noted that these cap rates are considerably higher than those recorded in Ariel\u2019s partner offices in the GREA network, where properties in unregulated multifamily markets are achieving sub-5% cap rates, fueled by perceived growth. Values for rent stabilized buildings in New York City have dropped around 35-60% below their ... More 2017-2018 peak as owners continue to struggle under the weight of rising expenses combined with the 2019 Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act (HSTPA), which capped rents. In 2024, the affordable housing sector represented 8% of New York City's total multifamily dollar volume, or $713 million of the $8.9 billion sold last year. This is a significant decrease from 2023, when it accounted for 35% ($2.6 billion of $7.4 billion), largely due to the sale of major portfolios like the $1 billion Omni affordable housing platform. Preservation remains a primary focus for mission-driven investors and operators, who continue to show strong interest in these assets, which offer risk-adjusted returns. Key transaction drivers include in-place assumable financing and potential collaboration between the city and state to preserve affordable housing. This could involve providing subsidies, extending benefits and incorporating Section 610 of the Private Housing Finance Law into regulatory agreements. Sozio said the 610 amendment stems from Senate Bill 7235, a law passed at the end of 2022 and eventually rolled out in 2023 and 2024. The law allows any building that is encumbered by a regulatory agreement in New York State to obtain a 610 amendment, enabling owners to rent apartments to tenants with vouchers and collect those rents even if they are above the previous legal rent level, which is particularly valuable for owners with rent stabilized units. So, if the voucher standard is $2,600 for a one-bedroom apartment and the legal rent is $1,300, the owner can collect the higher rent. \u201cThis is a meaningful piece of legislation sought after by some property owners to drive revenue higher while preserving affordability for the tenants because the rents are subsidized by the government,\u201d Sozio said. \u201cFrom a tenant\u2019s perspective, they\u2019re still paying the same percentage of their certified income, but it allows owners of these projects to get higher rents and address some of these increased expenses and improve their bottom line over time.\u201d A bright spot in the multifamily market space is that there is ample capital for well-positioned investments. Matt Swerdlow, a Senior Director in Ariel\u2019s Capital Services Group, explained, \u201cLenders have shown a strong preference for the free market asset class, which they view as a \"risk off\" lending opportunity in New York City commercial real estate due to the potential for rent increases and rents that keep pace with rising taxes and insurance costs.\u201d Swerdlow added that the lending market for rent-stabilized assets, while smaller than pre-2019, is still available. \u201cSeveral entities are active in this space, including banks without legacy balance sheet issues, government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, CMBS, and life companies (for sizable assets),\u201d he said. Additionally, private lenders, which have abundant capital seeking deployment, are now filling a role once held exclusively by banks. Investors are receptive to this private capital, seeking more flexible financing options that allow for early prepayment to capitalize on future appreciation, or refinancing into longer-term fixed rates when interest rates decline.
