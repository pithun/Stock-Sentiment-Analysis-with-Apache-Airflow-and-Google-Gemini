{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"Business Insider Edition  Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. Wonder what it was like to attend Nvidia's annual developer festival, where the party started with pancakes in the parking lot? Our reporter Emma Cosgrove was on the ground for the so-called \"Super Bowl of AI.\"  On the agenda today:   But first: What's next for Tesla?       If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here.           Tesla's stock has yet to have a winning week since President Trump took office. BI readers got an early signal trouble was coming.               Last month, Tesla investor Ross Gerber told our reporter Matthew Fox that the stock could decline as much as 50% in 2025. \"He let it loose for like 20 minutes,\" Matthew told me about the call with Gerber. Shares have slipped about 20% since our story. Overall, the stock is down nine weeks in a row.               There have been declining sales in Europe. Chinese rival BYD announced competing tech that it said can charge a car in five minutes. A downdraft in resale values. Consumer backlash over Musk's politics. Concerns about how much time Musk is spending on DOGE versus Tesla. Even Wall Street loyalists like Dan Ives started throwing shade.               Despite the string of woes, Tesla has boosters in the government, including President Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. As Dakin Campbell reports, their Tesla promotion is becoming an ethics nightmare \u2014 and it's not even working.               The stock could certainly rubberband back. A Cantor Fitzgerald analyst offered seven potential catalysts tied to Tesla's business prospects in the next year or so. In a Thursday night all-hands, Musk demonstrated that he can get away with more than other CEOs. He urged employees not to sell their Tesla stock \u2014 and won Ives over in the process.               Gerber told us in a follow-up call earlier this month that he doesn't see a rebound in sight.               Has the Tesla sell-off gone too far? Where is the stock headed next? Let me know what you think of our coverage at eic@businessinsider.com.               The Trump administration sent letters to 20 of America's most prominent Big Law firms, questioning them over their diversity programs. One notable absence from the list is Jones Day, a GOP favorite that appears to have many of those same diversity programs.               It's the latest instance of the president playing favorites with Big Law firms. Trump previously singled out Perkins Coie, Paul Weiss, and Covington & Burling, firms he believed wronged him politically in the past.       A strategy years in the making.

Now, its bankruptcy reveals a deeper flaw in America's healthcare infrastructure. Facilities that have been plundered can only be sold to others who are likely to continue the plundering, Bethany McLean writes.       Plunder, sell, repeat.           For years, tech employees enjoyed high salaries and swanky perks. But after the pandemic boom ended in 2022, the industry has drastically changed its tune.               Silicon Valley has embraced Elon Musk's slash-and-burn tactics: Performance pressure, proclamations of \"efficiency\" and \"intensity,\" and sweeping layoffs are the new norm. Employees across the industry told BI about the pressure to \"do more with less.\"       No more coddling employees.           JPMorgan told workers at its Polaris campus in Columbus, Ohio \u2014 which houses roughly 12,000 employees \u2014 to return to the office five days a week, starting on April 21, per an internal memo viewed by BI.               The memo also addressed the office's current lack of amenities by outlining plans to include offsite parking, a free shuttle service, and upgraded dining options. But Polaris employees who spoke to BI were unimpressed.       They shared why.   This week's quote:           \"It felt like a special kind of cruelty.\"               \u2014 A former Meta employee who found out they were on the company's \"do not hire\" list told BI.

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"Business Insider Edition  Music legend will.i.am says he bet on Tesla before Elon Musk took the wheel \u2014 but turned down the chance to be one of Airbnb's early backers.          \"I invested in Tesla in 2006, before Elon took over the company, and he's done great, taking it to where it is,\" he recently told Fortune. \"Hopefully, he can figure out a way to get it back to its glory.\"               The founder and CEO of FYI, whose real name is William Adams, stands to have made a fortune if he kept his stock. Tesla went public in June 2010 at $17 a share, or $1.13 adjusted for stock splits in 2020 and 2022.               The electric vehicle company's stock hit a record high of about $480 in December, representing a more than 420-fold increase from the IPO price.       Tesla shares closed at just under $249 on Friday, meaning an investor who bought in at the IPO price and held until now has made more than 200 times their money. Earlier buyers would have paid less for their shares, paving the way for an even greater return if they retained their stake.               The singer was asked on the \"Drinks Champs\" podcast last year to pick his favorite between Musk and Steve Jobs, the Apple cofounder.               \"Damn, both of those cats is why my life is nice,\" will.i.am replied, noting he was part of the team that sold Beats by Dre to Apple for $3 billion in 2014. \"You're talking about two companies that  changed my life \u2014 so I say both.\"               The rapper and producer recently told Channel 4 that Tesla has \"had its valleys and its highs\" and applauded Musk for having \"saved it out of bankruptcy in the past.\"               He also hailed Musk as a dreamer and one of the \"heroes of this era\" while sitting next to the Tesla and SpaceX chief during a 2012 discussion hosted by Singularity University's executive program.               Another entertainment legend, Morgan Freeman, has also said he owns Tesla stock and has spoken highly of Musk. \"He's, you know, what he's done, nobody else has ever done,\" the movie star said in 2016. \"He's landed a rocket ship so it's reusable \u2014 you know what a feat that is?\"               A representative for will.i.am declined to confirm whether he still owned Tesla shares, telling Business Insider he \"doesn't publicly discuss his holdings at this level of detail.\"               The music superstar \u2014 who shot to fame with the Black Eyed Peas and later became a judge on \"The Voice UK\" \u2014 told Fortune his previous bets include Pinterest, Dropbox, OpenAI, and Anthropic, along with another company that Musk now owns.               \"I invested in Twitter early on. When Jack [Dorsey] left, I sold it. Made good there,\" will.i.am said.               The \"I Gotta Feeling\" and \"Boom Boom Pow\" singer also said Airbnb cofounder and CEO Brian Chesky invited him to invest up to $200,000 in an early fundraising round.               After will.i.am learned the home-sharing platform offered neither a concierge nor room service to guests, he rejected the invitation. He explained that frequently traveling and staying in hotels meant he'd been \"pampered by the best,\" leading him to judge Airbnb by luxury hospitality standards.               Passing was the \"wrong decision\" and a \"bad one,\" he said at a recent SXSW event, per an Instagram video. Airbnb went public in December 2020 and is now valued at about $80 billion, meaning even a 0.1% stake would be worth roughly $80 million.               \"Ballin', I would have been,\" will.i.am quipped. \"Now, I'm like bawlin'.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  CELH Stock Celsius (NASDAQ:CELH) stock surged over 20% last week, following the announcement of a new distribution agreement with Suntory Beverage & Food Benelux, facilitating Celsius\u2019s expansion into Belgium and Luxembourg. [1]    Also, the recently released data for retail sales is largely seen as positive. Retail sales showed a slight 0.2% increase for the month, a recovery from the previous month\u2019s revised 1.2% decline. However, this fell short of the anticipated 0.6% growth. Excluding auto sales, the 0.3% increase met expectations. [2]  After its recent move, CELH stock looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy at its current price of around $33. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with CELH stock, which makes it attractive, but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is very high.  We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of CELH stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Celsius along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, CELH stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. \u2022 Celsius has a price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 5.8 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500  \u2022 Additionally, the company\u2019s price-to-operating income (P\/EBIT) ratio is 50.5 compared to 24.3 for S&P 500  \u2022 And, it has a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 73.1 vs. the benchmark's 24.3  Celsius\u2019 Revenues have seen massive growth over recent years, but the growth has slowed lately. \u2022 Celsius has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 71% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.3% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Its revenues have grown 2.9% from $1.3 Bil to $1.4 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Also, its quarterly revenues  decreased 4% to $332 Mil in the most recent quarter from $347 Mil a year ago (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500) Celsius' profit margins are around the median level for companies in the Trefis coverage universe. \u2022 Celsius\u2019 Operating Income over the last four quarters was $156 Mil, which represents a moderate Operating Margin of 11.5% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Celsius\u2019 Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $263 Mil, pointing to a moderate OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 19.4% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500) Celsius' balance sheet looks very strong. \u2022 Celsius\u2019 Debt figure was $20.3 Mil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $7.7 Bil (as of 3\/21\/2025). This implies a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 0.3% (vs. 19.0% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable]  \u2022 Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $890 Mil of the $1.8 Bil in Total Assets for Celsius. This yields a very strong Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 49% (vs. 14.8% for S&P 500) CELH stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. \u2022 CELH stock fell 46.1% from a high of $25.03 on 3 January 2022 to $13.50 on 27 January 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 6 July 2022  \u2022 Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $96.11 on 13 March 2024 and currently trades at around $30 \u2022 CELH stock fell 51.5% from a high of $2.21 on 4 March 2020 to $1.07 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 18 May 2020 In summary, Celsius' performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: \u2022 Growth: Strong  \u2022 Profitability: Neutral  \u2022 Financial Stability: Extremely Strong  \u2022 Downturn Resilience: Weak  \u2022 Overall: Strong Celsius Holdings stock currently commands premium valuations, but these are justified by the company's impressive sales and earnings growth trajectory in recent years. The energy drink maker has established itself as a formidable competitor to industry giants like Monster Beverage and Red Bull. The company received a significant boost when PepsiCo purchased an 8.5% ownership stake in 2022. This strategic partnership has been particularly beneficial, as access to PepsiCo\u2019s extensive distribution network has accelerated Celsius\u2019s recent growth and market penetration. The company\u2019s entry in a new market and acquisition of Alani Nu will further bolster the company\u2019s sales growth. Overall, despite its very high valuation, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that CELH is a tricky stock to buy. Not too happy about the volatile nature of CELH stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Published onMarch 23, 2025 When you think of a phone running stock Android, what comes to mind? If I had to guess, you probably think of a Google Pixel first and maybe a Motorola phone second, but you\u2019d be wrong on both accounts. It\u2019s not entirely your fault, though \u2014 Google makes Android, and Google makes Pixels, so it makes perfect sense to link the two together. However, if you picked up a Pixel running a truly stock version of Android, I don\u2019t think you\u2019d enjoy it all that much. Sure, it would work, but the truth is that stock Android just doesn\u2019t really exist anymore. Now, I know that there are purists out there who will argue that stock Android is the fastest, most efficient, and most customizable operating system you can get on a phone. You know what? They\u2019re probably right. A phone running the most bare-bones version of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) source code would be pretty quick and pretty easy to update because there would be nothing to it. There would be no apps, no Google services, and none of the all-important APIs that allow it to connect to cloud storage or make wireless payments. Truly stock Android is, well, just the stock that all other flavors of Android are made from. Even the privacy-focused, de-Googled versions of Android that claim they\u2019re nearly stock are just light, efficient Android skins. Every Google service that GrapheneOS or Murena\u2019s \/e\/OS removes is simply replaced by an in-house solution like Murena Workspace. Is it still Android? Of course, it is; it\u2019s based on the AOSP framework, but that\u2019s not the same as being stock Android. It\u2019s just a lightweight, simplified version of Android with slightly different priorities \u2014 and that\u2019s what makes open-source software great; not every version has to be the same. With that little bit of clarification out of the way, let\u2019s talk about light Android skins. As mentioned, this is where something like a Pixel UI comes in. Even though we often refer to Pixel UI and stock Android almost interchangeably, it isn\u2019t exactly correct. See, although Google\u2019s Pixel skin looks pretty close to what you\u2019d expect from stock Android, with simple menus and a pretty minimal interface, there are enough Pixel-specific features to it that we could never call Pixel UI stock \u2014 nor would I want to. In order to get a Pixel 9 to the point where you could call it stock Android, you\u2019d have to strip out all of the best Pixel-only features that we praise year in and year out. You\u2019d have to cut Hold For Me, Call Screen, Top Shot, Google\u2019s solution to astrophotography, and clever editing tricks like Add Me. At that point, you\u2019re left with a phone that might look pretty and perform well, but you\u2019ve pretty much removed any need to have the Tensor G4 chipset under the hood. Another company that claims it sticks pretty close to stock Android is Nothing, but a quick glance over Nothing OS is all you should need to know that stock-like isn\u2019t the same as truly stock. After all, a phone running stock Android wouldn\u2019t need a Glyph Interface full of LED lights on the back \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t know what to do with them. The LEDs haven\u2019t become as ubiquitous as something like native dark mode, and even that took ten versions of Android before it became a default customization. From a true software perspective, though, hunting down a Nothing Phone running stock Android sounds just as boring as doing it on a Pixel. You\u2019d have to give up the ever-present dot matrix that runs through most of Nothing\u2019s first-party apps and widgets, as well as several of the widgets that give the robot-inspired skin its personality. Personally, I\u2019ve become reliant on Nothing\u2019s 35mm-equivalent Road Trip Photo widget, which opens the camera to 1.4x zoom (35mm) by default, a focal length that I know well from my Fujifilm X100V and much prefer to the slightly too wide standard of 24mm. Strip all of that out? I probably don\u2019t want to use what\u2019s left. If Google and Nothing can\u2019t convince you that stock Android isn\u2019t good enough in 2025, I have another option for you: Pick up a phone running Android One \u2014 if you can find one. Android One is perhaps as close to stock Android as you can get, but it only existed because Google wanted to clean up the chaos of the budget Android segment. And, on that front, it kind of did its job \u2014 Android One gave cheap phones reliable, if inflexible, software with just a few extra apps so that companies could focus on improving their hardware while Google handled the software. Unfortunately, that controlled experience also kind of strangled the Android One program on its own vine. Because the low price points meant that developers could only do so much with their respective hardware, the cheap phones in the Android One program needed software wrinkles to stand out from one another, and those wrinkles just never materialized. Developers were only allowed five pre-loaded apps, including ones mandated by carriers and operators, giving otherwise simple phones even less room to stand out. In some ways, though, that lack of flexibility might have been the whole idea \u2014 because companies could at least rely on Google to update their cheap phones, they were suddenly able to put more time and energy into a worthwhile Android skin, at which point they no longer needed stock Android. Or, if they tried to stick with stock Android as Nokia\/HMD did, they suddenly found themselves not moving very many phones at all. And now, Android One is no more. It no longer has a landing page, phones no longer ship with it, and even the Reddit posts asking, \u201cWhat the hell is happening with Android One?\u201d died off about three years ago. It didn\u2019t offer enough personality for Google to stick with it on its Pixel A series, nor did it offer enough flexibility for Motorola to trust it with even the most affordable of Moto G devices. If anything, Android One taught other developers that stock Android wasn\u2019t the way forward, and now it\u2019s time for the most stubborn of Android fans to learn the same. Besides, on our list of the best phones with near-stock Android skins, not a single one of them actually runs stock Android. Sure, they get close, but it\u2019s the customizations and personalities that keep our favorite phones feeling together but not the same.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"Ever heard of VENIX? There were lots of variants of Unix back in the day, and VENIX was one for the DEC Professional 380, which was \u2014 sort of \u2014 a PDP 11. The 1982 machine normally ran the unfortunately (but perhaps aptly) named P\/OS, but you could get VENIX, too. [OldVCR] wanted to put one of these back online and decided the ST-506 hard drive was too risky. A solid-state drive upgrade and doubling the RAM to a whole megabyte was the plan. It might seem funny to think of a desktop workstation that was essentially a PDP-11 minicomputer, but in the rush to corner the personal computer market, many vendors did the same thing: shrinking their legacy CPUs. DEC had a spotty history with small computers. [Ken Olsen] didn\u2019t think anyone would ever want a personal computer, and the salespeople feared that cheap computers would eat into traditional sales. The Professional 350 was born out of DEC\u2019s efforts to catch up, as [OldVCR] explains. He grabbed this one from a storage unit about to be emptied for scrap. The post is very long, but you get a lot of history and a great look inside this vintage machine. Of course, the PDP-11 couldn\u2019t actually handle more than 64K without tricks and you\u2019ll learn more about that towards the end of the post, too. Just as a preview, the story has a happy ending, including a surprising expression of gratitude from the aging computer. DEC didn\u2019t enjoy much success in the small computer arena, eventually being bought by Compaq, which, in turn, was bought by Dell HP. During their heyday, this would have been unthinkable. The PDP\/11 did have some success because it was put on a chip that ended up in several lower-end machines, like the Heathkit H11. Ever wonder how people programmed the PDP computers with switches and lights? Minor correction. Compaq was bought by HP not Dell. Which is why x86_64 VMS only supports one type of bare metal server, and it\u2019s an HP. Otherwise, it has to run in a VM. Oh the irony of running VMS under a thinly-veiled {Li|U}nix OS. HP also bought Tandem. HP under the dumbass witch bought lots of overpriced companies. That\u2019s how corporate growth worked in the first .com era. None were a worse buy then EDS. Tata consulting had already stolen their business model, and is frankly better at it. But that\u2019s just because they have a larger supply of incompetent techs available to do the needful. Autonomy must be in with a shout for that accolade, surely!    DEC didn\u2019t enjoy much success in the small computer arena, eventually being bought by Compaq, which, in turn, was bought by Dell.  Er, not quite \u2013 it was HP who eventually bought Compaq. There were a few Soviet PDP-11 compatible desktop workstations and home computers (\u0414\u0412\u041a-3, \u0411\u041a-0010) and Cray. Iirc the article mentions those, though it\u2019s kind of like saying Yugoslavia was filled with Fiats because Yugo existed The chip-based 11\u2019s like the 11-03 had some success in reseach and lab applications. Had the fun of programming one in assembler.  HP was also competing in that market. After a number of years of working with assembly on several 8 bit processors, the PDP11 architecture was like a religious experience for me. My only complaint was that the tools all worked in octal rather than hex. But if you\u2019re working on a PDP11, octal is the base that makes sense.  Since most PDP11 instruction addressing is done by specifying a 3 bit address type, and a 3 bit register specification, if it\u2019s in octal you can easily just read what they are. If they used hex or decimal, it would be harder to just look at them and see where the 3 bits fields values\u2019 were. Octal made sense for when you looked at core dumps. But using octal for data  and addresses was a pain.  But mixing octal, decimal and hexadecimal in the same project is asking for problems. Given DEC\u2019s roots in 12 bit machines, octal was natural. Coming from a 16 and\/or 8  bit world, not so much.  Being able to depend on a byte having 8 bits and a word having 16 changed a lot of how things were done. Yup. with the 9825 and 9830\u2026..don\u2019t ask me how I know. I used Venix on a DEC Pro\/350 in the mid to late eighties (I was a teenager). We had a DG Eclipse MV 4000 running DG\/UX. The OS was sort of late Alpha or early Beta at that point \u2013 this was before the AViiON had even started. Most stuff worked, nroff very definitely didn\u2019t work all the way (the MS macros had something that would cause a core dump, for instance). Serial cables were a thing that existed, so I banged out a couple of shell scripts. One ran on the DG and would \u201cuucp\u201d the source file over to the Venix box. Then it would use \u201cuux\u201d to start a script running on the Pro. That script would nroff the file for you and uucp it back to the DG. Move the completed output file back over from the spool and it was nearly as good as having nroff locally. I was very proud of myself. The \/350 and \/380 had so much potential but it was obvious they had been intentionally handicapped so they wouldn\u2019t eat into PDP sales or even, honestly, VAX sales. Seriously\u2026 on a \u201cMIPS per user\u201d basis they would clobber a VAX 11\/750 or 780. That assumes a heavily loaded system, of course, but back then if your VAX wasn\u2019t heavily loaded then you were very clearly doing something wrong. I wish I hadn\u2019t googled this\u2026 \u201cXhomer\u201d is a Pro\/350 emulator. There went today\u2019s productivity. I dream about new system on similar machine, some serenity os , haiku or similar. no gui but fast . Meybe new minix 4 or fuzix on steride I was working at a university that was given 6 or 8 of the single board PDP\u2019s and the cartridge tape drive. After making a few plywood housings with power supplies we got to work on doing something useful. Booting from the tape took well over 30 minutes! We never got past he boot and debugging. I think they were throw out when new faculty cleaned out the physics department 20 years later \u2013 along with all the Weston cells and Leads & Northrup meters and ballistic galvanometers, old spectrometers, Kerr cells, a big Beckman analog computer, etc! I wish I had known. Usagi Electric (YouTube channel) has been working on a very similar machine, a PDP\/11 board and a power supply mounted on plywood, presumably used with some sort of spectrometer, I wonder if this was a common thing to do\u2026 I disagree with the closing remark that PDP\/11 was popular because of the single-chip that was put into lower end machines. The PDP\/11 was hugely successful  in the era when CPUs were multi-chip. One of the nice things about it is that the instruction set is nicely regular and complete. And it includes instruction features that were thought to be \u201ccheap\u201d when cpu clocks were still measured in kHz. If you use a loadable up-down-counter as a register, a pulse on the increment or decrement input is \u201cfor free\u201d.  So you had post-increment and pre-decrement addressing modes. Those stop being \u201cfor free\u201d once you get pipelining and other more advanced features. So nowadays those are no longer included in instruction sets. But back then they were great to have. In my early twenties and in the early 90s I got called into a medical publishing house to fix their PDP\/11. They had an entire publishing management system on it that had been written in assembly, in about six weeks, by one guy back in the 80s. They had tried to fix it themselves, including messing with the wire wraps on the boards. None of their serial ports worked as a result so they could not connect to it. So i was staring at a closet full of computer with no way to interface with it. I went to Radio Shack and got a wire wrap tool. I had no docs except for what was printed on the boards themselves. I proceeded to methodically rewrap the serial line posts until I got a connection on my, get this, Tandy 102. Once a got one of their VTs back online I could see the crash codes but knew not what to do I managed to get back in touch with the guy who wrote the software. He had me set him up with a connection via a 9600 baud modem and then send an interupt that crashed the system into a \u201cmicro code shell,\u201d as I remember him calling it. I sat by the modem on the phone with him for an hour or so while he tooled around in his old code. Ultimately he got it working again. I\u2019ll never forget that experience with that tech as it was fading into history. That picture reminds me of my first PC \u2014 A DEC Rainbow. I\u2019d bought it through the college for 1\/2 price which was still expensive and upgraded to 256K of RAM (rather than default 64K).  Made good use of it during those years as I could write my papers at home and program in Turbo Pascal for CS class projects. Upload to VAX for formal submission over 300, then 1200 baud modems. Luxury! We used to use computers with 4K of ram using a NTSC TV as a display. You can thank Carly Fiorina for tanking HP. She would never have been hired if Bill and Dave were alive. She is a total failure and failed trying to run for president. A total waste of skin. Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"ByCatherine Brock  ByCatherine Brock,  Contributor.  Software companies have an opportunity to shine in 2025. If nothing else, the stock market is full of surprises. 2025 began with investors feeling upbeat, with a new business-friendly president stepping into the White House. Now, a sell-off may be in the works as investors worry about tariffs and trade wars. Nodding to the tariff turmoil, here's a list of domestic services businesses as the top stocks for April. Since services are not subject to tariffs, these providers should be somewhat insulated from an escalating trade war. The top stocks below were identified by screening health care, technology and financial services businesses on these parameters: Mostly software companies passed this test, partly due to the margin requirement. The top six in terms of market capitalization were selected. The table below introduces six American companies that meet the criteria outlined above. Metrics are from stockanalysis.com and company earnings releases. For more investing ideas, see: best stocks for 2025 and best ETFs. Salesforce offers subscription customer relationship management (CRM) software that helps businesses manage and track customer interactions. The company has the leading market share in CRM, estimated at 29.2% by Apps Run The World. Salesforce also launched an agentic AI solution called Agentforce in 2024. Agentic AI supports complex conversations without human intervention. Salesforce has a strong balance sheet and a leading market position in CRM. The company also has a track record of revenue growth, though the growth rate has slowed in recent years. Offsetting the revenue trend has been a dramatic rise in operating margin from below 6% in fiscal 2023 to over 20% in fiscal 2025. Cash flow has gained also\u2014the company\u2019s free cash flow margin was nearly 33% last year, up from 20% two years ago. The latest results from Salesforce show momentum in data cloud and AI solutions, where revenue is up 120% from the prior year. The company also closed 5,000 Agentforce deals last year. These newer solutions enhance the company\u2019s growth opportunity and complement its dominant position in customer relationship management software. Salesforce pays annual dividends of $1.60 per share, for a yield of 0.57%. If you're looking for a higher dividend yield, see this list of best dividend stocks. Intuit develops and supports software for personal and business tax reporting, business accounting and consumer credit management. The company also owns the small business email service provider Mailchimp. Intuit is building AI capabilities into its solutions and the strategy is paying off. In the second quarter of fiscal 2025, Intuit reported 17% revenue growth driven by increases in its Global Business Solutions Group, Credit Karma and Consumer Group. GAAP operating income also rose 61% and GAAP diluted EPS shot up 26%. Management expects 12% to 13% revenue growth for fiscal year 2025. As Zacks Investment Research notes, the company has single-digit penetration in its addressable market valued at $300 billion\u2014meaning the growth opportunity is significant. The company also maintains a strong financial position, with $2.5 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet. Intuit pays annual dividends of $4.16 per share, for a yield of 0.69%. The company also actively repurchases shares, investing $721 million in the second quarter. Adobe provides a suite of creative applications through subscriptions to corporate marketing departments, graphic designers, video editors and photographers. The company also provides analytics and publishing solutions. Investors have not been kind to ADBE. The stock lost 20% in 2024 and is down nearly 9% in 2025. Impatience has prompted these losses. Adobe has devoted resources to developing and launching AI tools, but the monetization has been disappointing. In the company\u2019s last earnings call, CEO Shantanu Narayen said the team is focused on using AI to drive new, engaged subscription customers, rather than selling standalone AI products. This makes Adobe a longer-term play. The current stock price represents a reasonable value on a company that should continue growing revenue and earnings by 10% or more annually. Adobe does not pay a dividend but has a buyback yield of 2.86%. Autodesk provides subscription-based software for 3-D modeling, drafting, design, collaboration and production management. Customers include architects, engineers, product designers and media and entertainment companies. Autodesk reported consensus-beating revenue and earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025. The company also provided a fiscal 2026 guidance above expectations. Still, the stock is down about 9% year to date. The story is like Adobe\u2019s. Investors want to see stronger growth in Autodesk's cloud and AI offerings. However, the company is focusing on margins first. In the latest earnings release, Autodesk announced a restructuring plan that will terminate 1,350 employees. The savings will fund further cloud and AI investment. Autodesk expects to deliver industry-leading GAAP margins and fiscal 2026 revenue growth of 12.4% to 13.6%. PTC makes subscription-based software that helps teams design, engineer and optimize products and manufacturing systems. The company serves aerospace, defense, automotive, electronics, industrial equipment and health care businesses. PTC has a good record of growth in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and cash flow, demonstrating low customer churn and a productive business model. In its first quarter 2025 earnings release, PTC reported 11% ARR growth on a constant currency basis and 29% free cash flow growth. Both numbers are relative to the prior-year quarter. Operating margin declined somewhat to 20% from 22%. The company also spent $75 million on share repurchases. PTC is also reshaping its go-to-market strategy to be more targeted. This should enhance the growth opportunity for a business model that already has high visibility and resilience. Manhattan Associates offers cloud-enabled supply chain and inventory management software to retail, consumer goods, technology, life sciences, government and industrial customers. The company sells its applications on a subscription basis. Manhattan Associates has beaten consensus revenue and EPS estimates for at least eight consecutive quarters. In 2024, the company delivered over $1 billion in revenue for the first time and increased its cloud subscription revenue by $83 million. GAAP diluted EPS rose 24% to $3.51. The company also spent $241.6 million on share repurchases. The bad news is twofold. Manhattan Associates had a slow fourth quarter for services revenue and President and CEO Eddie Capel recently retired. Investors quickly repriced the stock, which has dipped 39.7% since the earnings release. The pullback creates upside for the company, which is expected to deliver 32% EPS growth in 2025. Bottom Line Software companies have an opportunity to shine in 2025. Growth prospects look especially strong for providers that are transitioning to AI-driven solutions. And, the escalating trade war\u2014a potential lag for goods exporters\u2014may signal it's time to increase your exposure to technology services stocks.","label":1}

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"ByBill Stone  ByBill Stone,  Contributor.  The decline in stock prices combined with plunging consumer sentiment and uncertainty surrounding ... More tariffs has uncreased uncertainty about future economic growth. Since stock prices ultimately depend on earnings, the pace of economic growth is crucial input to future stock performance. After briefly hitting correction territory in the previous week, which is defined as a 10% decline from an earlier high, stocks had a modest rebound last week. The S&P 500 sits 7.6% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a drubbing of 18.5% since mid-December. The pressure on stocks stems from an economic growth scare and policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Returns With the S&P 500 closing over 10% below its February 19 high on Thursday, March 13, stocks officially entered a correction. In the twenty-one U.S. stock market corrections since 1980, the average return in the 12 months following was 13.4%, which on the surface would lead to significant optimism regarding future returns. If the data is sorted between periods when the U.S. economy entered recession within those 12 months after the correction, the results are less compelling at a 1.9% average gain. Of course, if an economic downturn is avoided, the results have been spectacular on average at 19.1%. Average Stock Returns After S&P 500 Correction The strong bond between avoiding recession and better returns following a stock correction makes monitoring the economy's health even more critical. Economists' consensus estimate of 2025 economic growth has dipped slightly to 2.2%, nowhere near recessionary levels. Unfortunately, economists have a poor track record of accurately predicting economic growth with enough lead time, and consensus estimates tend to lag behind real-time data. Consensus U.S. Economic Growth Forecasts Economic models attempting to forecast the current quarter of GDP growth were developed to address the challenges associated with consensus estimates. These estimates adapt to the most recent economic releases to predict growth. This methodology has its challenges but adds additional color to the economic backdrop. The Atlanta Fed model points to a contraction in economic activity in the first quarter, which is probably overstated because much of that downward estimate comes from a marked increase in imports to avoid future tariffs. The St. Louis Fed\u2019s model remains in positive territory. The forecast difference between the two is vast for their first-quarter GDP estimate. After last week's Federal Reserve meeting, the committee noted that \u201cuncertainty around the economy outlook has increased.\u201d Estimated Frist-Quarter U.S. Economic Growth While accurately forecasting an economic downturn in advance with any accuracy is exceptionally challenging, monitoring some high-frequency data can help get an early warning about increased recession risks. These indicators were chosen because they are updated weekly or daily and have shown a strong correlation with economic activity. Indeed, other indicators are crucial, but they are typically only available monthly, sometimes with a significant time lag. The labor market is probably the most crucial part of the economy since consumer spending eventually wanes without wages to fund the purchases. Initial claims for unemployment benefits are reported weekly, but the four-week moving average of claims is used here to reduce volatility. While initial claims are above the lows, the level is not exhibiting a strong uptrend or at a level consistent with economic woes. Initial Jobless Claims The other weekly job data is ongoing claims for unemployment benefits, which are also off its lows and show a slow uptrend. This indicates that it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to find a new one. Remember that the number of employees in the U.S. has more than doubled since 1970, so even though the current roster of those receiving unemployment benefits is as high as it was during the 1969-1970 recession, the numbers aren\u2019t comparable. The bottom line is that the labor market is softening but has not yet reached recessionary levels. Continuing Claims The corporate bond market should undoubtedly be part of the mosaic to monitor the economy\u2019s health. Baa corporate bond data has a long history and arguably provides a look at the \u201ctypical\u201d credit quality of companies, as Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry that more bond defaults could be on the horizon, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. While the spreads on Baa corporate debt are above recent lows, the increase seems insufficient to trigger substantial fear of any impending economic downturn. Corporate Bond Spreads The Chicago Fed produces the National Financial Conditions Index weekly. It looks at 105 measures across three categories, risk, credit, and leverage, to create a measure of financial conditions. According to the Chicago Fed, \u201cPositive values of the NFCI have been historically associated with tighter-than-average financial conditions, while negative values have been historically associated with looser-than-average financial conditions.\u201d The chart shows that these periods of tighter-than-normal financial conditions have often been associated with recession. Like the previous measures, financial conditions have worsened but remain below warning levels. Financial Conditions The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This suggests that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclical stocks has improved off its most recent lows and isn\u2019t at the level seen before past recessions. Performance Of Cyclical Stocks The 10-year Treasury minus 2-year yield is probably the most well-known predictor of recession. Historically, when the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury falls below the 2-year yield, also called yield curve inverting, a recession is coming. Since the 1970s, a yield curve inversion has occurred before every recession. The only blemishes on its record are the 1998 and mid-2022 inversions, which produced no subsequent economic recessions. The U.S. economy did see a significant slowdown in the first half of 2022 but rebounded in the second half. Unfortunately, even when the signal is correct, it has variable lead and lag times. The yield curve still has a better prediction track record than the economists and is used in about every Federal Reserve model, so it is worth watching despite its warts. The curve is not currently inverted, so this model forecasts no recession. The Yield Curve & Recessions The economic calendar releases for the week are not of the highest importance. The two most notable are February durable goods orders on Wednesday and personal income and spending on Friday. Last week, the Federal Reserve left its projected rate cuts at two but increased the inflation and unemployment forecasts. In addition, the median forecast for GDP growth was lowered. Markets saw this as a somewhat dovish signal and pushed expectations closer to three cuts for 2025, with the first in June. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected Correctly forecasting a recession is challenging in the best of times, but the post-COVID-19 period, with its irregular economic cycles, makes it even more perilous. These high-frequency indicators should provide a reasonable early warning system for a sizable economic contraction. Currently, the odds point to an economic slowdown rather than a recession, which bodes well for reasonable returns from the correction bottom. As always, there are no easy calls when it comes to forecasting the short-term movement of stocks or the economy, especially in a period of increased uncertainty around the severity of the tariffs. For example, though most are rightly concerned about the downside risk from tariffs, there is an upside if somehow this pressure results in better trade terms for U.S. companies. There is always uncertainty. So, investors should have a portfolio with enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses. This cushion can help moderate the impact of stock declines on a portfolio and allow one to withstand the inevitable stock declines to experience the benefits of long-term ownership. Within the stock portion, focus should be paid to companies that can weather economic dislocations and perhaps even take advantage of them, regardless of their stock price movement.

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"Business Insider Edition  Will Champion was 24 and working at a board game caf on New York's Upper West Side in 2021 when he and his friends decided to turn their Dungeons & Dragons hobby into something bigger.          Champion was making a meager $15 an hour at the game caf as a dungeon master, the storyteller who often leads the games, and felt like he could do better. \"Why don't we just do it ourselves?\" his friend, Woody Minshew, then 25, suggested.               The group of four 20-somethings, most of whom had performing backgrounds, began streaming a D&D campaign on YouTube and Twitch under the moniker \"The Bards of New York.\" They found they enjoyed playing together for an audience, and people were eager to join their community. So they started a Discord, began to build relationships with their listeners, and scrapped the idea of working as dungeon masters. \"We still had to have muggle jobs,\" says Kyle Knight, one of the group members, referring to non-D&D jobs, \"and DMing, when done well, is very time-consuming.\" They also wanted to make the game as accessible as possible.               Things took off in 2023 after a clip of their stream went viral. The video, which got 3.5 million views, captured two characters who'd shared a slow-burn romance finally confessing their feelings. Comments flooded in from people who shared their favorite D&D moments or wanted to experience a similarly heartwarming game. The Bards gained a new audience and are now the 19th-most-popular D&D streaming channel on Twitch, based on TwitchMetrics. They had tapped into the growing market of tabletop role-players.               Once considered a niche game for fantasy nerds to play in someone's basement, tabletop role-playing games have entered the mainstream. In 1968, Gary Gygax, a game designer and the cocreator of D&D, organized the first-ever tabletop convention, known as \"Gen Con,\" in his basement with a dozen or so people. Last year's Gen Con conference in Indiana set new attendance records, with over 71,000 attendees and 540 exhibiting companies. In 2020, Wizards of the Coast, the owner of D&D, touted a seven-year growth streak, saying that online play grew by 86% that year.               As its popularity has grown, D&D has inspired a film and a hit TV show and attracted over 50 million players worldwide, Wizards of the Coast says. Other tabletop games such as Pathfinder, Call of Cthulhu, and RuneQuest have seen a similar surge in popularity. Meanwhile, board game cafs owners have seen demand explode over the past few years, with more cafs popping up across the US. For a select few streamers, the boom has been incredibly lucrative. Leaked data from Twitch showed that Critical Role, one of the most popular D&amp;D streaming channels, earned over $9.6 million between 2019 and 2021 from a combination of subscribers, tips, and ad revenue.               The nerds are taking over \u2014 and they may have the solution to America's loneliness crisis.               Cherie Wright, a 36-year-old from Virginia, was one of the people who saw the Bards of New York's viral TikTok. She'd never played D&D before but found herself captivated by the storytelling. As she watched the group's streams, she familiarized herself with the game's lingo. \"I learned what 'rolling the dice' meant, and what a 'perception check' is, and why everyone gets so excited about a 'natural 20,'\" she says.               Wright became an active participant in the group's Discord and Twitch chats, which now have several thousand members. \"There's really a love for connecting with other people,\" she says, describing the community as \"enchantingly warm\" and \"wildly creative.\"               The community has been a critical support for her, especially when her job as a museum director was busy and she had a hard time getting out of the house. \"I didn't realize how close to burnout I actually was,\" she says.               Since the pandemic lockdowns, lots of people are in a similar boat, with many of us spending more time alone than ever before. In the group chats, fans would talk about the stream, share pet photos, or ask for help if they were having a bad day. \"People became regulars and we all learned each other's names,\" Wright says.               A little over a year after she joined the community, Wright decided to learn more about D&D. In the tabletop role-playing game, which celebrated its 50th anniversary last year, players design their own characters and set out on a quest. They roll dice to battle enemies, find treasure, and complete challenges in order to reach the end of a campaign that can span anywhere from a single afternoon to a couple of years.               \"I walked into my local game store just with the intention of asking about it,\" she says. There was a one-shot session \u2014 a short adventure that can be finished in a single sitting \u2014 in progress and she decided to join. She was immediately hooked. \"I met some of my now best friends that day,\" she says.               Playing consistently can be tricky because people's schedules are always changing, but she still manages to make it work. \"At one point, I was playing two or three times a week with different groups and different nights, but right now it's about once a week.\"               In the past decade, tabletop role-playing games have taken on a new life. The hit TV show \"Stranger Things,\" which first aired in 2016, brought D&D back into the spotlight. \"It was such a phenomenon,\" Knight says. \"It broke a lot of stigmas by just placing it into the zeitgeist and making it seem fun and acceptable.\"               The show's success made Hannah Minshew, one of the Bards, suddenly feel cool. \"I was like, 'Oh, I know what a Mind Flayer is. I have this exotic information that you all don't. Let me teach you. I'm the cool guy,'\" she laughs.               D&D is far from the only tabletop game that's popular today. Warhammer 40,000, also known as Warhammer 40K, is a turn-based tactical wargame in which players collect, assemble, and battle detailed miniature armies against each other. Based on traffic to its website, the gaming site Goonhammer estimates the game has 2.4 million players each month. In December, Games Workshop, the publisher of Warhammer, announced that it had sold Amazon the film and television rights to the game universe. That same month, Games Workshop made it onto the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 index, a list of the largest UK companies.               Marcus Pascall, a 53-year-old in San Diego, had largely given up role-playing games when \"Stranger Things\" came out. Pascall's son Ian was 10 years old at the time. \"Everyone in school was talking about it, so I dusted off my old books and ran a D&D game for him,\" he recalls. \"It was nice to see role-playing games through the eyes of someone who hadn't played before.\"               Now in college, Ian continues to play tabletop games with his friends, and Pascall himself has returned to D&D. For the past three years, he's been running a monthly game with his 29-year-old daughter and some of his friends. His daughter, who lives in Los Angeles, drives two hours to make the sessions.               Pascall has noticed a big shift in the culture from when he was playing. \"In the '80s, being called a nerd was a massive insult. And you avoided it at all costs, and you felt insulted, you felt almost ashamed,\" he says. \"We're all nerds now. It's all one big group. It's like, 'I don't care if you don't have social skills. Come play with us.'\"               For John Edwards, 60, who was active in the role-playing game world for decades, the social experience was always the main draw. \"You've got a topic that you can talk about, even if you don't have a lot of other things in common,\" he says. A large part of the audience is made up of adult men, many of whom, he says, \"don't have any good excuses to all sit down together and do something.\"               Although Edwards has shifted to more traditional board games over the years because of how time-consuming it was to run D&D campaigns, he still values how the games opened up his social circles. \"Particularly in a country that is very polarized politically right now, it means you can sit across the table from people that you otherwise maybe wouldn't be comfortable sitting with,\" he says.               Anna Prosser, a 40-year-old Oregonian who is a streamer on the weekly D&D show \"StonesThrow,\" has found that committing to regular play has had other positive impacts on her mental health.               \"A lot of times we grow out of play and out of imagination,\" she tells me. \"It's considered something that's for children.\" She says that \"committing to times of play every week\" has helped her to retrain her imagination and improve her creativity, problem-solving skills, and mental health.               Plenty of research backs up the benefits of play for adults, finding that it improves creativity and can help people process stress. In a study published in July, researchers at University College Cork in Ireland found that D&D helped people's mental health by providing escapism, self-exploration, and social support. \"The most interesting finding for me and for a lot of people that I've talked to is this exploration of self,\" Orla Walsh, the study's lead, says. \"I can't think of many hobbies where you get to do this.\"               She says one player who was struggling in a male-dominated work environment created a confident character that helped her practice being confident in real life. Another player, a comedian who lost his grandfather, felt pressure to be the comic relief for his family while struggling with his own grief. As the dungeon master, he created a monster representing his grief, which allowed him to privately process his emotions. \"No one else knew that it was happening but he gained so much from it,\" Walsh says.               Prosser says that using her imagination more brought \"a vibrant inner life back into focus\" and has helped build her confidence in making decisions. \"The stories I've helped write in D&D have helped reassure me that perfection isn't possible and life is good without it,\" she says.               By acting as different characters with different personality traits and talents, she's also learned a lot about what kind of person she wants to be. \"It's really important to have the flexibility of looking at the world and looking at problems through a different perspective in order to either affirm your own or enhance your own,\" she says. \"D&D gives you a really safe place to do that.\"               Because it's been accepted more broadly in mainstream culture, the game is welcoming to a wider range of people. Prosser says that the expectation of who a D&D player is has changed significantly over the years.

When everyone is a nerd, nothing is really nerdy \u2014 that's made it easier to find really special communities in the tabletop game world.

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"One Quest gaming dev told us that \"Google is treading the same path towards failure\" as Stadia and Daydream by shutting smaller devs out.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Google made no effort to reach out to indie VR and XR game developers at GDC 2025. Combined with social media reports that most top-selling Quest devs were \"rejected\" from Google's Android XR boot camps, it's painting a worrying picture about what to expect from Android-based headsets like Project Moohan. Google loves GDC; it has a huge presence there every year. This year, its panel on real-world AI applications in game development filled up 45 minutes before it started. It had several Android gaming panels and a large Play Store exhibition in the West hall, and it partnered with Samsung on another Galaxy panel. GDC is well-known for its private hotel demos off the show floor. Perhaps Google made an Android XR push behind closed doors with larger VR publishers.  But Google's decision not to court indie VR devs publicly with panels or demos \u2014 at the same conference where Meta pushed its new passthrough tech and reassured devs how profitable their store is \u2014 seems pretty telling. It's all but guaranteed that the Google I\/O 2025 program in May will have workshops on Android XR \u2014 to court 2D app devs. Gaming rarely comes up at I\/O, and this platform is public, so it's not as though Google needs to wait for some big reveal. Will Google have the same disdainful approach to VR gaming that Apple does with the Apple Vision Pro? At least one VR gaming dev we spoke to thinks that Android XR is already heading in the wrong direction by spurning the people who made Quest headsets so popular.  The Quest Store is flooded with meme games, social multiplayer targeting teens, and indie content you'd typically see on Steam. It turns off many VR elites and frustrates VR devs making \"serious\" content, but these games strike a chord and keep people returning to the Quest 3S headsets more regularly to spend money. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Android XR is compatible with Unity, OpenXR, and WebXR, with controller support built into the UI. During our press preview, they suggested that headsets like Samsung's Project Moohan \"support gaming use cases.\" They said that \"hopefully\" this universal compatibility \"will lead to incentives for people to port over to Android.\" You'd think the owner of the Play Store would recognize the power of smaller developers to strike it big and reach out to those developers to give Android XR greater visibility. Instead, according to developer RJ White at Soaring Roc Studio, \"9\/10 top devs for the Quest platform\" have been rejected from Android XR coding boot camps, and he sees this as a premature death knell for the platform. I've seen 9\/10 top devs for the Quest platform rejected for @GoogleARVR's bootcamps for Android XR now. I'm talking about devs \/ people with games that were in the top 5 top selling. Google is so quick to repeat their mistakes from Daydream, see y'all on @killedbygoogle soon pic.twitter.com\/JOH2AJ7gwiFebruary 20, 2025 \"Google is treading the same path towards failure that they did with Stadia and Daydream. By shutting out some of the most experienced and smaller studios and developers, they're showing they've learned zero lessons with how to manage or grow a modern software platform,\" said White in a discussion with Android Central senior editor Nick Sutrich. White, whose indie studio has made several Quest titles like Spiders and FireZone, says that studios and games from \"humble origins\" power huge successes from major platforms. However, he believes Google is \"too focused on trying to force a polished diamond out of a large team as quickly as possible\" instead of \"cultivating an environment that lets those smaller teams thrive and carve a gem out on their own.\" \"XR developers aren't just game developers; they're 3D interaction experts,\" says White. However, by rejecting them and prioritizing the same \"just make things flat\" approach as Apple, Android XR will be \"2D dependent to a fault.\"  White's thoughts don't prove Android XR is bound to fail, and we don't have evidence that Google is fully ignoring Quest developers beyond word of mouth. Rather, it reflects a perspective among some VR developers that without overtures from Google, it's hard to know how much stock to put into Android XR \u2014 or whether Google knows what it needs to do to make it successful. Big Tech wants to make productivity XR headsets the new alternative to laptops, but none of the big-name consumer products have sold at a massive scale. Apple allegedly sold 500,000 Vision Pros, and Samsung wants to sell 100,000 Moohan headsets. VR gaming remains the one definitive use case that has attracted millions of users. So, is there a reason why Google wouldn't prioritize it?  Samsung's Project Infinity headset is rumored to have Sony-made micro-OLED displays with 13.64 million pixels per eye, arriving in the second half of 2025 with a hefty price tag. Beyond that, other announced Android XR devices include a Sony enterprise headset that'll cost almost $5,000, Xreal AR glasses, and an unconfirmed Lynx XR headset that may trend toward the pricey side. So perhaps Google wants to focus its outreach to the enterprise and productivity app creators because it knows people won't spend thousands of dollars to play Gorilla Tag when the Quest 3 is already here. It needs a \"killer app\" to justify its existence, and Google must assume that app won't be a game. Maybe Google truly believes that gaming developers don't need an Android XR boot camp because they can easily port over OpenXR games without much effort.  Perhaps, as White suggests, they're underestimating these XR developers' ability to do more than gaming software and create useful 3D app content, whether for headsets or AR glasses. We know Android XR will have similar camera tech to the Quest's new passthrough API, but Google didn't come to GDC to appeal to XR devs as Meta did. Or maybe Google is following the lead of its hardware partners, who don't care as much about gaming. If Samsung decides to make a Quest rival, then Google could prioritize gaming, right? Frankly, whatever Google's reasoning, I'm not a fan of Google potentially downplaying the importance of gaming for the future of Android XR. It should be building up momentum now so that devs are ready to overload Project Moohan with content by the end of the year. Hopefully, by Google I\/O in May, VR gaming devs will have more reason for optimism that Android XR is a viable new platform for them.

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"Business Insider Edition  I live with my partner, and I'm the breadwinner in our house. At my data entry job, I punch in numbers, edit metadata records, learn new software to keep up with the ever-changing times, and grunt a word of acknowledgment when a new load of work comes my way. Each day, I carry on with more of the same.          It covers most of the household expenses, including the mortgage, utilities, property tax, and one credit card bill each month. Some may say that the pay level is adequate. For what I do, I don't disagree. It isn't exactly interesting, so why would it pay a more substantial wage?               It is mostly empty work, and it does nothing to fulfill me mentally, emotionally, or spiritually. Yet, I'm stuck with it because the current job market is poor, competition for similar roles is high, and due to several factors, I am the only one in our house who works full-time.               I have found personal fulfillment elsewhere, in my side work as a writer. This extra income has also allowed me to take on the pets' expenses and pay off the mortgage a bit faster. I do wonder sometimes if I'm overworking myself.               The data entry job is full-time, five days a week. I also work on assignments or pitches every day, even on weekends. Every Saturday and Sunday, I wake up before my partner \u2014 aside from the cats \u2014 to get a few more hours of writing work in. Even so, the work is anything but consistent.               While sometimes I have a few assignments going at a time, there might be weeks or months when I don't have any work at all. During those downtimes, I work on my short stories, though none have been published, yet. Writing fiction is its own kind of therapy for the grind of my bread-and-butter job, though I do get material while I'm there. While I'm in my cubicle, I often hear dialogue or get ideas about characters that I can bring into these pieces of fiction. Some days, I can get pages full of material, all for free, from that place. This is only one of the invisible perks I have found as I scrounge to make the most of a dreary situation.               Yet, I can do both and still have three-hour naps on most Saturdays and Sundays. I wake up to the friendly furry face of one of my cats giving me sandpaper kisses, usually a subtle signal to get a late afternoon snack ready. I am not where I want to be with this work arrangement, but I am on the road to somewhere interesting. Any improvement is better than standing still.               It can be a heavy feeling being the main breadwinner in our little family. Thoughts of \"What if I became incapacitated? Would my partner be able to keep the boat afloat?\" have frequently crossed my mind. I have gotten a few chronic work-related injuries due to this role, like tendonitis and neck pain. Learning to cope with it has brought a new understanding of my partner's chronic pain.               Being an introvert my social needs are small, and can easily be met with infrequent online calls with family and friends, squeezed in between one job and the next.               Through writing, I have found the space to grow my inner landscape and the opportunities to talk to people I would never have had an occasion to otherwise. It also helps meet my small social needs. Also through writing, be it nonfiction or fantasy, I can take the small daily emotional stresses that my cubicle life causes and clear them out of my system. It's a good way to experience catharsis.               Data entry drains me emotionally and physically, but writing renews me and keeps me floating through my days. Even if it takes up more of my time, it has been a lifeline to more emotional stability and inner meaning.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"Business Insider Edition  This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Pete Petersen, 58, who has been looking for work since February 2024 after he was laid off from his corporate job. Petersen spent much of his career in the consumer products healthcare division of a pharmaceutical company. He suspects his age and salary expectations have hurt his chances of finding a white-collar job. His words have been edited for length and clarity.          I live in Hingham, Massachusetts. I was raised by two parents who grew up in tougher circumstances. I grew up in what you'd probably consider an upper-middle-class lifestyle in an upper-middle-class town. I wasn't as frugal as my dad, but when I spent, I felt guilty about it.               I went to the University of Massachusetts and graduated with a bachelor's in communications because I wanted to go into film and television. I was working with people in the industry for a long time, some 35 years old living in tiny New York City apartments and barely rubbing pennies together. I was seeing all my friends doing pretty well and having a good time, so I ended up moving back to Boston and starting a career in sales.               I connected with what was at the time SmithKline Beecham, a consumer healthcare company. I joined with the idea that it was going to be three years, and then I'd go off and find someplace else to make my millions. Thirty years later, in 2019 when GSK merged with Pfizer, was when my career there ended.               Do you have a story to share about working into your later years? Please fill out this quick Google Form.               I started out at GSK doing retail sales, driving from store to store, talking to people in the aisles, talking to store managers about building displays, and making sure our product was in stock. I learned the business at the ground level, showing up on Saturday mornings to reset stores. Then I managed a team that oversaw regional supermarket chains.               In the early 2000s, it was becoming more about data analytics. I had a boss who encouraged me to get into a job that was very analytical. I moved to calling on national accounts, which in my case with CVS. I went there and fell in love with it. I could lock myself in the basement for three days and dig into the data to figure out what our business trends were and look at where we were failing with the customers.               In 2019, we'd have these meetings, and I would always laugh because everyone would say, \"Who's going to get the ax?\" I would show them the gray in my beard and be like, \"My time has come,\" because I was pretty expensive. I was right, and downsizing came in December of 2019. In March 2020, all hell broke loose, so I looked for a job during that time.               I finally landed at a broker distributor that had worked for regional food chains. They ended up folding that up. I switched to working for a company that produced a cannabis sleep aid. The branding was awesome, and it was a dream outcome. I also invested in a brewery with a former colleague, and I helped with my wife's business.               I thought to myself, I would turn 62 and sell the product while still making six figures, and I would navigate the end of my career like I never could have dreamed of.               Despite having success building the business, the job ended abruptly and unexpectedly with the discovery of financial misconduct by the CEO and his tragic passing shortly after. I was out of work in February.               Early in the process, there were opportunities that showed up that I didn't take. When I was interviewing for jobs and some of the pay packages were much lower than I wanted, I thought, \"I have a daughter I just finished paying for college for, and I have a son in college.\" There's a bit of ego too.               I had a conversation with an old colleague who went through a similar thing \u2014 ended up with a consultancy and did OK \u2014 but he never did as well as he did at GSK. I learned you have to stop looking at jobs like you would have when you were 39. You have to start looking at what are the jobs that I can do that access my skills, motivate me to get out of bed in the morning, get my brain going, and cover my costs. If you're looking for that unicorn, you're going to turn down a lot of opportunities trying to find it.               At this stage of my career, it feels like if people are going to hire somebody my age, it's almost like the puzzle piece has to be exact. If they were hiring me at 40, it's like doing a puzzle, and you pick up a piece, and it looks like it fits and it's close enough.               I'm not afraid of technological changes because I grew up at a time when they happened rapidly. But there is a feeling that being out of work for a year has made me lose my step. Am I going to go to work and not even recognize what people are doing? Has it moved this fast?               The best-case scenario I've seen is maybe 10% to 15% below my former base pay, but there are jobs 25% to 40% below my former base pay, even more so if you consider the total package.               Still, I interviewed with a couple of CEOs and companies, but they ended up falling out. If you hire the exact same person at 40 who can help grow the business, they could get at least six to eight years out of him. But when you look at somebody my age, you wonder if by the time he builds out his solid network in the area which he hasn't worked in, is he going to leave?       Ageism is real, but it's not about a bunch of people sitting around saying, \"We aren't going to hire the older guy.\" They'd love to bring in experience, but they weigh all the different factors. I think they perceive me as at the end of my career. But if I went to work for a company where I had a boss who would get up every morning and treat me like I was treated when I was being trained in a skill set in my 20s, that would not be as workable for me.               I was great at personal finance and saved a decent amount of money, so I've been able to weather this particular storm. GSK gave me a very good severance package, so I don't worry about things like healthcare. But I know for someone making a third or half of what I was making in a situation like that, this could be devastating.               I could theoretically retire in November, but I would be living on half the budget that I would've hoped to, which would significantly change my lifestyle. I set plans my whole life, and I did the right thing saving, and this has set me back significantly from that plan.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"The stock market is doing exactly what it\u2019s supposed to do. I know it\u2019s hard to feel calm when news of escalating tariffs and grim financial forecasts make the headlines. When the market drops, it directly impacts the financial goals you have tied to your assets in the market. But from our perspective at CapWealth, the market is performing as it should. The market gets volatile when uncertainty is high. And there is no shortage of uncertainty at the moment. The possibility of an escalating trade war, mass federal firings and other unsettling events are rippling throughout the broader economy. Even companies that are not directly affected by the volatility may hit pause and reassess their plans for the near future. Where does that leave the individual investor? We talk about businesses, sectors, and industries, but these things are all made of people. The market\u2019s performance reflects our collective sentiments about the future. And if we don\u2019t know what is going to happen from day to day, then neither will the stock market. Last year\u2019s stock market was \u201cfrothy,\u201d meaning that valuations grew on enthusiasm for the future. People were willing to invest in speculative assets and pay a high cost for stocks with low earnings. They hoped those speculations would pay off, and the real earnings of those high-flying stocks would catch up with their valuation. Now? Investors are taking the gains where they can find them. We look for a \u201cnew normal,\u201d in a world with sudden, constantly changing, and contradictory headlines. Unfortunately, this is what volatility looks and feels like. The market is just reflecting that feeling. It\u2019s natural to want to pull your money out of the market. But it\u2019s not what I would recommend. Your individual goals \u2014 saving for retirement, home renovations, or your children\u2019s education \u2014 exist on a completely different timeline than the financial news of the hour. When the entire market is selling, that creates buying opportunities for investors. Nobody, not even the most successful portfolio managers, can time the market. No one knows the exact, correct moment to sell and buy. But over a long enough time frame, the most successful investors tend to be the ones who stay the course through calm and volatile markets. Finally, one of the best ways to stay calm in a volatile market is to diversify. Find sectors, companies, and asset classes that don\u2019t behave like the broader markets. These will act like an anchor for your portfolio, limiting the pain of a market drop. This takes a great deal of research, and we are always happy to talk to you about an investment strategy that makes sense for your personal, long-term goals. In the meantime, expect the bumpy ride to continue. Participating in the stock market means opening yourself to risk. Risk and return go hand-in-hand. The more risk you take, the more return you should earn. But it takes time and discipline. It is the flip side of the high earnings potential and the rewards of compounding interest. If it makes you feel worried, you\u2019re in good company. But volatility does not last forever. This too shall pass.

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"VR devs used to get major marketing help from Meta and Sony. Now they're scrambling to stand out as the Quest Store skews toward teens.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  The GDC 2025 show floor had a much smaller crowd of VR developers than last year. The Meta booth was crowded with hopeful indie devs aiming to join Oculus Publishing or get some of that $50 million Horizon Worlds grant money. But most established publishers didn't pay for booths. Given the current \"VR visibility crisis,\" I found that quite telling. On Monday, XR industry vet Jim Squires led a panel called \"Solving VR Gaming's Visibility Crisis: Strategies for Reaching Mainstream Audiences,\" which included the publishers behind Moss and Ghosts of Tabor, a VR marketing CEO, and IGN's executive editor. The panel highlighted the major dip in revenue that VR developers are experiencing, both on the Quest Store and other platforms. Meta's Oculus Publishing lead addressed this criticism in a later GDC 2025 talk, claiming Meta's store changes had a \"very small\" impact on developer profits. This panel took a different stance, as they explained how the money well and marketing support from these platforms dried up, leaving them to fend for themselves. But that doesn't mean the devs behind the best Quest games are giving up, either. This panel highlighted the new ways developers will try to reach VR gamers, sidestepping the Quest Store or other VR platforms entirely for discoverability.  Polyarc publishing director Lincoln Davis shared how Sony initially took them under their wing with incredible publicity and support, recognizing that Moss would exhibit to the masses how cool VR could be. Sony took a \"shotgun approach,\" reaching everyone from hardcore gamers to casual non-gamers. Moss got a major E3 slot and was included at road shows, concerts, baseball and football games, store activations, billboards, Black Friday and NFL commercials, and major social media pushes, with on-the-go demos available to show people what the game (and VR) was about. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Ultimately, Davis estimates they've gotten about $42 million in ad support from publishers across multiple platforms. But after those glory days of reach where quality meant attention, the VR platforms wanted \"direct measurement\" of the \"return on investment.\" These platforms left behind the \"three-steps-removed\" mainstream crowds while retailers like Gamestop and Best Buy started removing the headsets that let \"normal\" people try VR for themselves. Instead, Sony refocused all its marketing on the serious gamer crowd, which had already had inroads; it generally hasn't given the PSVR 2 the same level of attention as the original, which multiple panelists bemoaned. Meta, meanwhile, prioritized PR for the hardware, or for self-owned games like Beat Saber or Supernatural. Of course, as IGN's executive editor Ryan McCaffrey explained, it's \"very much an uphill battle\" to get their core audience to click on articles about VR games, especially \"original IP.\" Outside of well-known franchises like Batman: Arkham Shadow or Alien: Rogue Incursion, gamers won't engage with VR content. Whether it's Sony or devs themselves, relying on the gaming press to reach your audience may not work.  Long-time VR developers used to be able to count on prime Quest Store placement at launch to help them reach out to initial customers and build up reviews and momentum. Now, Squires says, store placement is no longer the \"be all, end all,\" and he asked Maeva Sponbergs, head of publishing and CMO at Beyond Frames, how they're reaching out to audiences without being \"dependent on\" the Quest Store for visibility. Sponbergs likened VR's current \"discoverability problem\" to what happens on Steam, the iOS App Store, and the Android Play Store. The Quest 3 and Quest 3S remain the only viable option for VR devs to make money. However, now that pretty much anyone can put their game on the Quest Store, it's harder for any one game to stand out and earn a piece of the pie, no matter how good it is. So now, Beyond Frames has had to \"switch over focus really, really quickly, using old and tried methodologies and trying to acquire users off the platform.\" They looked at everything from Pinterest to Facebook ads to target the older, non-gaming crowd for family-friendly fare while focusing on Reddit and Discord outreach for serious shooters like Ghosts of Tabor. Polyarc's Davis agreed that they had to look at both core gamer outreach and unconventional marketing to keep Moss profitable years later. They're paying influencers to share games with younger audiences that don't don't use traditional media to decide what to play. And for older audiences, they're actually reaching out to book and wine clubs that might all decide to try games together, leading to \"great clickthroughs\" and \"great comments\" for an older title that wouldn't stand out on the store. Most interestingly, in my mind, Polyarc, Beyond Frames, and other VR devs formed a \"cross-studio collaboration\" where they pushed each other's games on social media and storefronts. They even provided major discounts \u2014 up to 75% \u2014 to their partners' games, without requiring that people buy their games first. It led to a \"huge increase in not only revenue but also unit sales.\"  VR devs who got in on the ground floor are struggling with deflated sales, but they still have built-up reputations, old profits, or VC investments to fund new ventures and relationships with the major platforms that they can leverage while they look for alternative profits. A smaller VR studio without critical acclaim and resources will have more of an uphill battle. Both IGN's McCaffrey and marketing expert Stephanie Greenall suggested a key way to raise awareness of VR games is to hide the fact that it's virtual to begin with. Devs who don't have a famous IP to rely on need to look for a \"hook\" that'll attract people's interest and do well in headlines because, otherwise, gamers won't pay attention. That's why I suspect we'll see more small developers trying to use TikTok, Twitch, or Instagram to attract the growing teen crowd on Quest headsets, aiming to win over influencers and streamers to get their games on the map. I'm also curious if more developers will try to band together to support each other's games. But given the lack of VR devs on the GDC show floor, I'm curious whether some of them will take an every-dev-for-themselves approach, instead. Update: Polyarc's Davis reached out to clarify that Sony (not Meta) included Moss in NFL ads, and that they provided discount codes to partners' games without requiring purchase first (as I mistakenly suggested).

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily. Jane shifted nervously on the hard examination room table at her regular semiannual visit. In some ways, she was happy to be there. She loved her doctor. A few years before, after years of misdiagnoses by other doctors, this one had discovered her brain tumor and successfully removed it. That day, Jane expected to once again express her gratitude to the woman who had saved her life. Instead, a stranger walked through the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be replacing your doctor,\u201d said the new man while abruptly applying a cold stethoscope. Jane felt like crying. Following the surgery, Jane had announced that as a gesture of gratitude, her family would be endowing a chair for the doctor who\u2019d performed her surgery at the university hospital where she worked. The position had helped the doctor, then relatively fresh in her career, rise several levels at the hospital in record time. Jane had figured the doctor would be pleased by the gift. But ever since, Jane had sensed a certain chilliness creep into their relationship. She felt snubbed that day in the exam room\u2014hurt, but also baffled. Despite Jane\u2019s repeated attempts to reach her, she never heard from the doctor again. As a psychologist fascinated by the paradoxes of the human psyche, I have for years struggled to understand why extreme or continual acts of generosity not only may fail to inspire lasting appreciation in the receiver but can lead to outright hostility. Jane (whose name I\u2019ve changed) is a patient of mine, and her story is one example of many. I\u2019ve seen it over and over in my practice: A gesture that is initially received with intense gratitude curdles into hurt or anger. \u201cYou gave too much\u2014it made them hate you,\u201d I\u2019ve said to my patients so often that the line has become jarringly familiar. I\u2019ve been through this kind of thing myself. Decades ago, one of my closest high school friends overdosed at a party after her boyfriend dumped her. After finding her body slumped on the floor, an empty pill container beside her, I raced her to the emergency room. Her stomach was pumped, and she survived. For weeks after, she showered me with thanks. But before long, the communication tapered off, then stopped altogether. It was my first experience with the tyranny of the gift. Imbalanced relationships are often thought of in terms of one person\u2019s resentment at feeling that they\u2019ve given too much to the other. A family member or friend may lend money without a clear expectation of when it will be returned. A girlfriend will encourage her partner to spend time with his friends, then stew when she is left behind. But what about the resentment of the person to whom the largesse is given, particularly when there is no quid pro quo? In these cases, the ill will might feel perplexing. The very notion that generosity can boomerang may at first seem counterintuitive. After all, this is a value we have been taught to strive for, for good reason: It is an important ingredient in successful relationships. A couple who stays married for decades shows appreciation for each other. Even office mates might all chip in for a wedding or retirement gift for a colleague. Yet examples abound in my psychology practice of relationships that have toppled under the burden of generosity. Once, a patient of mine who covered for a colleague repeatedly at work received from him a poor evaluation that cost him his job. Another patient housed a family whose home had burned down, only to have that family ghost her. Then there was the woman who lent her close friend a sum of money to stave off bankruptcy, telling her not to worry about repayment. Little did she know that what she really had to worry about was that her friend would renege not only on the loan but on their friendship. So why does altruism backfire? Shabnam Smith, a psychiatrist and assistant clinical professor at Columbia University Medical Center, warns against \u201cany relationship where there is an imbalance in power.\u201d She describes that imbalance as problematic because \u201cthere is a loss of agency. It makes any relationship feel fragile.\u201d She told me she \u201cis concerned about relationships where too much is given because there can be a sense of infantilization, a sense of being beholden.\u201d As crucial as generosity is to the health of any relationship, so is equilibrium, which is characterized not by dependency but by interdependency. A relationship in which one feels that they owe something to the other makes the dynamic seem imbalanced. Smith says: \u201cWhen it is not clear how they can make something up to the other person, the person being given to invariably feels a lack of control. It can feel daunting.\u201d When gratitude is too big, it spills over into shame, which inevitably, even understandably, leads to discomfort and anger. In fact, emotional reciprocity\u2014each individual feeling both given to and received from\u2014is not just a benefit to a relationship (romantic or otherwise). It is an essential component. Anthropologists have long demonstrated that gifts, particularly extravagant gifts, are never free. As Marcel Mauss\u2019 classic book The Gift demonstrates, every personal gift, even an altruistic one, incurs debt. Personal relationships need mutuality. In its most stripped-down definition, mutuality is about knowing that in a relationship both people have needs and that each person\u2019s needs matter. In their 1992 book Spare Parts, Ren\u00e9e Fox and Judith Swazey write about kidney donation, the extraordinary act of selflessness that gave rise to the term tyranny of the gift: What recipients believe they owe to donors and the sense of obligation they feel about repaying \u201ctheir\u201d donor\u00a0\u2026 weigh[s] heavily on them. This psychological and moral burden is especially onerous because the gift the recipient has received from the donor is so extraordinary that it is inherently unreciprocal.\u00a0\u2026 As a consequence, the giver, the receiver, and their families may find themselves locked in a creditor-debtor vise that binds them one to another in a mutually fettering way. So what can you do to counteract this process? Is there any way to avoid it? In my practice, I have found that there are strategies both before and after that can mitigate or even sidestep the ruptures that relational inequality can cause. You can avoid falling into the tyranny of the gift by communicating boundaries and worries ahead of time. My patient who helped bail her friend out of bankruptcy told her: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the money.\u201d That isn\u2019t realistic, nor ultimately is it caring. I wish she had been direct ahead of time about her worry that the money might come between them and set a clear deadline for repayment. What she might have sacrificed in terms of her own feelings of selflessness she would have more than recouped in relational reciprocity. Relationships don\u2019t falter because of hard things; they falter when the hard things are ignored and\/or hushed up. Before giving, the giver should also thoroughly examine themselves and their motives. Are they taking care of things they don\u2019t need to? Are they operating from the belief that someone else\u2019s needs matter more than their own? If so, why? Where did this self-abnegation begin, and why does it persist? Is this person truly caring for a loved one or indulging in a kind of martyrdom that could easily backfire? Delving into these questions honestly can help anyone avoid a whole raft of unforeseen consequences. But what if, having ignored the warnings, a person finds themself in a nonreciprocal dynamic? The answer: They must name the situation for what it is. It may be uncomfortable to observe and describe disparities, particularly financial ones. But it is important to overcome these anxieties. In the general treatment of anxiety, people are advised to \u201cname it to tame it.\u201d In the context of giving, closely observing the disparities between the giver and the receiver can begin the process of recalibration. When my friend overdosed, I thought I was being kind to keep silent about what had happened; after all, I didn\u2019t want her to feel bad about the lengths I\u2019d gone to to save her. Judging by her behavior, that was the wrong strategy. If I had to do it over, I would approach the issue with care but also directness. How was she feeling about the fact that I saw her in such a vulnerable state, and did she now think she owed me something? Love and respect can be demonstrated in many ways; one of them is by paying attention to difference and inequality. Another reason to name disparities is to open the channels of communication. My patient Jane never got to tell her doctor how much the connection meant to her or that her doctor\u2019s care had not only saved her life but enriched it. The truth was, there was no real disparity between them: Jane\u2019s doctor and Jane had both given to each other, just in different ways. If only they had communicated openly, then they might have seen that. \u201cSometimes what we see at first glance\u2014what is obvious\u2014is not what is going on relationally,\u201d Smith remarked when I told her about my patient\u2019s dilemma. \u201cThere\u2019s always a deeper story.\u201d In any relationship, flexibility is a sign of strength. Adapting and growing with shifting needs is a measure of a connection\u2019s sturdiness. Our stories are not fixed. Neither are our definitions. It\u2019s time to redefine what we have traditionally thought about giving in relationships. The tyranny of the gift can be avoided, but only when we begin to value reciprocity as a gift as well.

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"ByMatt Craig  ByMatt Craig,  Forbes Staff.  \u201cN etflix has won the streaming wars. Case closed,\u201d analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a MoffettNathanson report published Monday on the streamer\u2019s recent earnings update. \u201cBut where does the company go from here? How much more runway for growth is ahead?\u201d Since November 2021, Netflix, which recently passed 300 million subscribers globally, has been trying to convince users, investors and developers alike that one of the answers to that question can be video games. And it has put real money behind that conviction. By fall 2023, according to widely cited reports, Netflix had spent $1 billion on gaming, buying up four smaller development studios and building two of its own in California and Helsinki, Finland, while publishing dozens of titles for mobile devices, including tower defense game Bloons TD and graphic adventure Oxenfree. Analysts believe the company likely spent another $1 billion on gaming in 2024 alone, increasing its offering to 140 games made available to anyone with a Netflix subscription, all without ads or in-app microtransactions. Traction in the gaming marketplace has been harder to come by. Netflix\u2019s portfolio of mobile apps has recorded 192 million total downloads, according to data provider Apptopia, and daily active user counts hover around 1.1 million, each fractional compared with mobile publisher competitors and even smaller in relation to Netflix\u2019s overall subscriber base. \u201cWe\u2019re not yet the Netflix of games,\u201d Netflix president of games Alain Tascan said on Wednesday as he presented at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. \u201cBut that\u2019s exactly where we\u2019re headed.\u201d Tascan is a newcomer to the streaming giant, having joined the company in July and replaced its original games chief Mike Verdu a few months later. Under his leadership, Netflix is rethinking its gaming strategy, moving out of direct competition with large game developers and into a more supplemental role for its primary streaming offering. Going forward, Netflix Games will focus on the development of more games that can be played inside the Netflix app on connected smart TVs, where 70% of Netflix viewership already happens, utilizing phones as the controller via a mobile app. The company also wants to create casual party games that can \u201creplace family game night,\u201d and make more offerings for younger children, who Tascan says make up 15% of Netflix\u2019s linear entertainment viewing hours. And the service wants to build more \u201cinteractive experiences\u201d that can extend the life of Netflix\u2019s IP from popular homegrown shows and movies, as it has done with Squid Game and Too Hot To Handle. That\u2019s a far different strategy from the traditional idea of the \u201cNetflix for games,\u201d under which startups like Blacknut and Shadow, as well as tech giants such as Google (Stadia), Apple (Arcade) and Microsoft (Xbox Game Pass), have built a cloud-based library of games that can be sold for a subscription. Google shut down Stadia in 2023, citing a lack of user interest. Apple and Microsoft have succeeded (on mobile and console, respectively), although primarily as a marketplace for third-party content rather than as a home for original creations. Netflix\u2019s pivot also seems to remove it from the race to create the next blockbuster game like Fortnite or Call of Duty: Warzone, evidenced first in October by dozens of layoffs and the shuttering of its California studio, which was focused on bigger-budget AAA game projects, before it had published a single title. \u201c[Netflix] shouldn\u2019t be trying to be something they\u2019re not,\u201d says Jason Chapman, cofounder and managing partner of gaming venture fund Konvoy Ventures. \u201cThey\u2019re not a AAA content production house, but they should continue to lean into interactive.\u201d This evolution from linear, passive entertainment on Netflix to more interactive experiences makes a lot of sense, in theory. The $180 billion gaming industry now dwarfs the size of traditional Hollywood movies and television (estimated at $100 billion annually) and has become the preferred pastime for younger generations. As far back as 2019, Netflix co-CEO Ted Serandos cited Fortnite as its major competitor for user attention\u2014no doubt one of the reasons the company hired Tascan, who worked previously as an executive at Epic Games on Fortnite. However, Netflix\u2019s early efforts at line-blurring interactive content\u2014such as the headline-grabbing Black Mirror: Bandersnatch\u2014did not catch on, and in November, the company announced it would be removing dozens of similar titles from its library entirely. (Bandersnatch is one of only four that remain.) To date, Netflix has yet to create a game, or any game-like experience, that has captured and maintained the interest of the broader public over an extended time. Even Squid Game: Unleashed, which the company touts as one of its biggest success stories, hit six million downloads when it debuted in December, peaked at nearly 13 million downloads in January and then fell to 700,000 in February and just over 100,000 in March, according to Apptopia data. That game, notably, is the first not to require its players to have a Netflix subscription to play. Bonus Round: With Squid Game: Unleashed, the developers experimented with a \u201cwatch along\u201d feature that unlocked certain rewards for players who had viewed Seasons One and Two. Netflix\u2019s answer, in the short term, has been licensing. In December 2023, the company announced it would be offering three old Grand Theft Auto titles to anyone with a Netflix subscription, and to date, GTA: San Andreas has been its most downloaded and played game by far. Internally, Netflix says it has its own set of criteria for games success, such as subscription acquisition and retention, and the ability to drive engagement back to its linear programming. With Squid Game: Unleashed, the developers experimented with a \u201cwatch along\u201d feature that unlocked certain rewards for players who had viewed Seasons 1 and 2 of the show. \u201cThose effects are relatively small currently, but frankly so was our investment in games relative to our overall content budget,\u201d Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said during the company\u2019s earnings call in January. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to stay disciplined about scaling that budget as we see continued scaling in member benefits.\u201d What Netflix Games has in its favor is the time and resources to experiment. The company grew its overall revenue by 16% in 2024, generating $10 billion in operating income and nearly $7 billion in free cash flow. In MoffettNathanson\u2019s recent analysis, it projected continued revenue growth, stronger margins and a higher stock price, all without mentioning the gaming division once in the 26-page report. \u201cDo I think games are a core focus for them? Absolutely not,\u201d says Chapman. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t a throw-away or a Hail Mary pass for them. They\u2019ve put too much money into this.\u201d In the not-too-distant future, Chapman predicts, Netflix will begin to implement monetization strategies such as in-app purchases and ads\u2014drawing on lessons learned and infrastructure created by the company\u2019s push into linear advertising in 2024\u2014that would bring the viability of the games division into sharper focus. Until then, he says, the company can afford to continue searching for its place in the market. Tascan acknowledges that is a privileged position to be in in a games landscape that faced industry-wide layoffs, budget cuts and company closures in 2024. \u201cI say sometimes to the team, \u2018We have a golden ticket,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhat are we going to do with it?\u201d","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"ByPeter Cohan  ByPeter Cohan,  Senior Contributor.  JULICH, GERMANY - JANUARY 17: The D-Wave Systems Advantage quantum computer, the first such system ...

(Photo by Lukas Schulze\/Getty Images) How long does it take to turn a scientific breakthrough into an investment score? When it comes to quantum computing, the answer remains unknown \u2013 but the world has been waiting for about 66 years. Due to the high trading volume in such stocks \u2013 including IonQ, Rigetti Computing, Quantum Computing, and D-Wave Quantum \u2013 I guess traders are betting on the uncertainty about whether the payoff is more likely years or decades away. Big scientific breakthroughs generally take a long time to reward investors. Two years ago, I decided to write about generative AI. The book, \u201cBrain Rush: How to Invest and Compete in the Real World of Generative AI,\u201d was published last July, many decades after the failure of an AI startup where I worked. In a January Forbes post, I explored why Rigetti Computing stock had jumped so much and argued the stock would drop due to the company\u2019s declining revenues, operating losses, excessive valuation, and vulnerability to industry news snippets. This piqued my interest in writing a book on quantum computing. Yet as I developed a book proposal, I found something missing \u2013 a vibrant ecosystem powered by compelling value for end-users \u2013 which seemed to be taking off for generative AI in 2023 as I wrote \u201cBrain Rush.\u201d In January, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said quantum computing could be decades away from realizing its economic promise. By last week, he had changed his mind \u2013 announcing a bet on a Boston-area research center to help Nvidia overcome the impediments to realizing the technology\u2019s potential. While he tries to solve these problems, Palo Alto, Calif-based D-Wave Quantum has demonstrated companies will pay for quantum computing. Yet investors should be skeptical of whether the technology will deliver more value for businesses and investors than classical computing does. Wall Street views D-Wave stock as considerably over-valued and competition from deep-pocketed players like Nvidia and Google could prevail over D-Wave in the race to commercialize quantum computing. Quantum computing swaps classical computing\u2019s bits that store either a 0 or a 1 with qubits, which can hold a combination of a 0 and a 1 enabling two qubits to hold four values powered by \u201cexotic metal chilled to about 460 degrees below zero,\u201d according to the New York Times. In 1959, the American physicist and Nobel laureate Richard Feynman first suggested the idea for quantum computing, according to Britannica. Feynman envisioned when electronic components get small enough, quantum effects \u2013 in which objects lack clearly defined states \u2013 could be used to build more powerful computers. Such quantum effects were first discovered in the early 1900s by Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, and others, according to the American Museum of Natural History. Quantum effects were demonstrated by an experiment in which a single ph0ton of light passed through a screen with two small slits \u2013 producing a wavelike interference pattern of all available paths. However, this wave-particle duality collapsed when one of the slits was closed to detect which path the photon took. The act of measuring changed the object being measured, noted Britannica. Feynman\u2019s idea was first realized in 1998 as a 2-qubit quantum computer. Built by scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, MIT, and University of California - Berkeley, the system \u2013 while trivial for solving meaningful problems \u2013 did demonstrate the principles of quantum computation, according to Britannica. Since then, quantum computing computers have thousands of qubits and firms that build and operate such systems are publicly traded. Yet it remains to be seen whether quantum computers solve problems meaningful to businesses and consumers in ways vastly superior to what classical computers can accomplish. At the moment, quantum computing\u2019s headwinds appear to vastly overpower its tailwinds. Quantum computing\u2019s headwinds are ferocious \u2013 including big technical impediments, high error rates, deep-pocketed rivalry, and threats to a fundamental cybersecurity technology. Details follow: The flip side of all the competition is that big companies might solve the knotty problems impeding the realization of Feynman\u2019s 1959 vision for quantum computing. Nvidia\u2019s NVAQC could unlock a new growth opportunity for the chip designer. The lab\u2019s aims include tackling qubit noise and deploying quantum processors to solve \"important problems, from drug discovery to materials development,\u201d Nvidia\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang told Fast Company. Meanwhile Google has reduced quantum computing\u2019s error rate during complex analysis by increasing the number of qubits. Experts believe \u201cit is only a matter of time\u201d before quantum computing realizes its potential. \u201cPeople no longer doubt it will be done,\u201d Harvard physics professor Mikhail Lukin told the Times. \u201cThe question now is: When?\u201d Nvidia\u2019s bet on quantum computing followed backlash against Huang\u2019s January skepticism. D-Wave was among those challenging Huang\u2019s claim \u201cthat practical use of quantum computing was decades away,\u201d noted Fast Company. D-Wave strongly disagreed with Huang. \u201cIt\u2019s an egregious error on Mr. Huang\u2019s part,\u201d D-Wave CEO Alan Baratz told Fast Company in January. \u201cWe\u2019re not decades away from commercial quantum computers. They exist. There are companies that are using our quantum computer today.\u201d D-Wave has paying customers, loses money, and made a headline-grabbing announcement in March about the company\u2019s \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d which has evoked skepticism. My take is there is no rush to buy the company\u2019s stock. While D-Wave\u2019s revenue did not grow and the company lost more money in 2024, its bookings and customer count rose. More specifically, D-Wave\u2019s 2024 revenue of $8.8 million was \u201cessentially flat,\u201d noted a company release, while the company\u2019s net loss of $146 million was nearly 50% more than in 2023. The company increased its customer count and bookings last year. Specifically, D-Wave added two customers to reach 135 in 2024 while bookings increased 128% to $23.9 million in 2024, according to the company release. D-Wave forecasts Q1 2025 revenue to exceed all of 2024\u2019s. \u201cWe expect first quarter fiscal 2025 revenue to exceed $10 million including revenue recognized from the sale of an Advantage annealing quantum computer,\u201d noted the company release. That sale is \u201cnon-recurring,\u201d according to TipRanks \u2013 suggesting there may be less here than meets the eye. D-Wave also claimed the company had achieved quantum supremacy \u2013 the notion that its quantum computer outperformed classical computers on a real-world problem. \u201cWith record bookings, a record cash position and an unequivocal demonstration of our quantum system outperforming classical on a real-world problem\" our progress is clear, said Baratz, according to the release. D-Wave based its quantum supremacy claim on a paper published March 12 in Science. D-Wave said it completed magnetic materials simulations \u201cin under 20 minutes with a quantum computer \u2014 a task that would have taken nearly a million years on a leading supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory,\u201d D-Wave senior distinguished scientist Andrew King told the Wall Street Journal. This achievement represents the \u201cHoly Grail\u201d in quantum computing, Baratz told the Journal. \u201cThis is what everybody in the industry has been aspiring to, and we\u2019re the first to actually demonstrate it,\u201d he added. However, academics have already disputed D-Wave\u2019s claims. For example, Dries Sels and colleagues at New York University performed similar calculations on a regular laptop using tensor networks \u2013 which reduce the amount of data and hence energy needed to perform simulations, reported New Scientist. The debate rolled on with King disputing Sels\u2019 claim \u2013 concluding, \u201cThey\u2019re great researchers, but it\u2019s not something that refutes our supremacy claim,\u201d according to New Scientist as Sels retorted King\u2019s response was \u201cpetty.\u201d Another scientist echoed Sels\u2019 claim \u2013 arguing classical computers can achieve comparable results. Since D-Wave\u2019s claim of quantum superiority, scientists have discovered new methods that overcome classical computers\u2019 relative weakness in materials simulations, the Flatiron Institute\u2019s Center for Computational Quantum Physics research scientist Miles Stoudenmire told the Journal. \u201cWe\u2019re just saying, \u2018Look, this one problem at this one time didn\u2019t beat classical computers. Try again,\u2019\u201d Stoudenmire added. I will give D-Wave the last word here. Competing studies tested only a subset of problems addressed in D-Wave\u2019s work and the company\u2019s quantum simulations \u201ccovered a broader range of lattice geometries and conditions,\u201d Baratz told Quantum Source. What does this all mean for investors? D-Wave stock is about 12% too high, according to TipRanks which compared the company\u2019s current stock price of $8.46 to $9.63 \u2013 the average 12-month price of five Wall Street analysts. Although D-Wave has $300 million in cash, the company\u2019s lack of growth suggests a investors may need to wait for Baratz to devise a new growth vector to propel the company\u2019s stock.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"A Wealth of Common Sense Posted March 23, 2025 by Ben Carlson I like Jesse Livermore quotes because they\u2019re often multi-faceted. This is one of my favorites: Another lesson I learned early is that there is nothing new in Wall Street. There can\u2019t be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again. I agree with this sentiment. Human nature is the one constant across all market cycles. Even AI won\u2019t change that. I also know the stock market structure is constantly changing and never the same. Here\u2019s one of my favorite annual charts from the UBS Global Investment Return Yearbook: \u00a0 I still remember reading The Intelligent Investor for the first time and wondering why Benjamin Graham kept writing about railroad stocks. Well, it was written in the 1940s and Graham grew up when railroad stocks ruled the day. That\u2019s not the case anymore. Tech stocks rule the day in America. In the UK, it\u2019s more spread out. Ownership of the stock market is always changing too. This Goldman Sachs chart is another personal favorite: Stock market ownership used to be heavily concentrated in the hands of households. That\u2019s not the case anymore. Households still have the highest ownership percentage but it\u2019s dropped from more than 90% in 1945 to 38% now. The fund industry controls more than one-quarter of the stock market. Foreign investors make up neatly one-fifth of the total. Obviously, households still own most of the stocks through these other vehicles but there is far more diversification in the ownership structure. I think this is a good thing for the health of the market. Eggs are in lots of baskets now. Leadership in the stock market is always changing as well. Regular readers of A Wealth of Common Sense know I\u2019m a huge fan of performance quilts. Here\u2019s a great one from DFA that ranks country stock markets over the past 20 years: Who would have thought Denmark outperformed American stocks over the past 20 years? But the real takeaway here is how the performance rankings are constantly changing. Can you imagine if you had to guess who the best or worst performer was in a given year? The global stock market is schizophrenic and I mean that as a compliment. It wouldn\u2019t make sense if the rankings were the same year in and year out. It wouldn\u2019t be much fun either. The stock market has to change all the time. Otherwise it wouldn\u2019t offer investors a risk premium.

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"ByPamela N. Danziger  ByPamela N. Danziger,  Senior Contributor.  Broken window in jeweller's shop after raid Signet Jewelers just reported year-end earnings and it was disappointing. Fiscal year 2025, ending Feb. 1, was down 7% from previous year, dropping to $6.7 billion from $7.1 last year. And that comes after revenues declined 12% from $7.8 billion in fiscal year 2023, as CEO J.K. Symancyk admitted in the earnings call, \u201cGrowth has been elusive in recent years.\u201d Because Signet is the world\u2019s top retailer of diamond jewelry and the nation\u2019s largest jewelry retailer, it is a bellwether of what\u2019s happening in the jewelry market. It operates 2,700 stores and e-commerce sites under the name brands Kay Jewelers, Zales, Jared, Diamonds Direct, Blue Nile, James Allen, Banter by Piercing Pagoda and more. That\u2019s why Signet\u2019s guidance for fiscal 2026 is alarming. Total sales are expected between $6.53 billion to $6.8 billion. That means Signet sales will be off between 13% at the high end of guidance and 16% at the low-end over the last three years. While the company plans to focus on growing its market share, specifically increasing its 10% share of the $10 billion bridal jewelry market and mid-single-digit share of the over $50 billion fashion jewelry market, Signet apparently couldn\u2019t do that in 2024. The U.S. jewelry market grew a surprising 5% last year, from $81.3 billion in 2023 to $85.4 billion in 2024, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. However, that is likely to change as affluent consumers, on whom the jewelry industry depends, are showing a growing reluctance to purchase jewelry as they once did. It can be argued that the broader jewelry market grew last year due to the continued momentum of luxury jewelry customers, while Signet sales fell because it primarily targets the mass and aspirational consumers, who scaled back their discretionary purchases. But the answer isn\u2019t as simple as that. Pandora, which competes in the same mass and accessible jewelry segment as Signet, generated 14% revenue growth in the U.S. last year and experienced 8% same-store sales growth. In the luxury jewelry sector, Richemont, with its luxury Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels brands, grew a remarkable 15% in the Americas through the third quarter ending Dec. 31 to reach $4.3 billion. However, LVMH\u2019s watches and jewelry group, led by Tiffany and Bulgari, was only able to eek out 1% growth in the U.S. last year to $2.8 billion. And research firm Tenoris, which surveys 2,000 largely independent specialty jewelry stores for its market tracking, found sales growth last year was a tepid 1% with unit sales down 2%. The jewelry retailers it surveys attract primarily the more affluent shoppers in their communities. \u201cThe luxury market in America will undergo significant changes in 2025, driven by shifting consumer preferences, economic factors, and evolving attitudes toward experiences, sustainability, and digital engagement,\u201d warned Chandler Mount, founder of the Affluent Consumer Research Company, with which I am affiliated. In the realm of consumer goods, jewelry stands out as the most discretionary purchase. Unlike items such as clothing, handbags, or watches, which serve functional purposes, jewelry is purchased purely for its emotional or symbolic value and has not practical use. This means jewelry, regardless of its cost or brand, is the most luxurious of all consumer goods. So when affluent consumers turn off to jewelry purchases, it\u2019s not a good sign for any jewelry brand or retailer, no matter whether positioned in the mass, aspirational or luxury jewelry segment. And that\u2019s what is happening. Affluent consumers\u2019 intent to purchase jewelry over the next three months declined from 28% in the third quarter 2022 to 22% at the start of this year, according to the ACRC longitudinal luxury tracking study among affluent consumers with incomes $200k and above. The ACRC survey sample roughly corresponds to the top 20% of U.S. households, of which there are 26.4 million out of the nation\u2019s total 132 million households. And among those high-income earners, some 6.5 million households are at the top 5% of income, earning $316k or more. Net\/Net: the drop from 28% to 22% purchase incidence means some 1.5 million affluent households have put a hold on new jewelry purchases in any particular quarter, dropping from 7.3 million active buyers in 2022 to 5.8 million most recently. Mount explains that most affluent consumers buy luxury items quarterly or less frequently, \u201cunderscoring that luxury consumption is tied to specific needs, events, or aspirations rather than habitual purchasing.\u201d In the case of jewelry purchases, those needs are primarily around milestone life events, holiday and occasional gifting. Those occasions aren\u2019t going away, but jewelry brands face cross-currents in that regard. Lab-grown diamond jewelry is becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to natural mined diamonds, more often for self-purchasing and occasion gifting. However, LGD jewelry is cutting into the industry\u2019s prime bridal market where it has a significant price advantage and a sustainability edge. According to The Knot, just over half of the engaged couples surveyed in 2024 said their engagement ring featured a LGD center stone and couples spent an average of $4,900 for their 1.7 carat LGD ring, as compared to $7,600 for a mined diamond engagement ring. Tenoris reports that the increased popularity of LGD is cutting into the traditional jewelry market. Natural diamond jewelry unit sales declined 3% last year, as prices increased 3%. By contrast, LGD jewelry unit sales soared by 43% while the average price decreased 8%. In addition, luxury consumers are increasingly choosing to indulge in experiences over material goods and jewelry is caught in that crosswind too. \u201cConsumers increasingly prioritize experiences like travel and dining over physical goods, reflecting a cultural shift toward meaningful, memory-driven consumption,\u201d Mount said. So instead of choosing jewelry for an anniversary, birthday or holiday gift, consumers might choose a memory-making experience like a cruise or luxury resort stay. And for that all-important wedding event, the dollars saved on a LGD ring leaves more money to spend on the honeymoon. Hanging over the entire luxury market are questions about the economy. Mount notes that affluents feel personally stable or better off financially, but they are less optimistic about the broader U.S. economy. This is resulting in more cautious spending, particularly in highly discretionary categories such as jewelry. Based on Mount\u2019s assessment the jewelry market, even at the luxury high-end, is poised to experience a \u201cnotable\u201d contraction, more so if the economic outlook doesn\u2019t improve. \u201cThis jewelry market decline is attributed to several factors, including increased competition from lab-grown diamonds, changing consumer preferences, and economic challenges,\u201d he said, adding that the trend toward more experience-driven purchases is changing the dynamics in the jewelry industry specifically and the luxury market in general. \u201cWhile consumers still appreciate quality and authenticity, they are placing greater importance on experiences and ethical practices. Luxury brands must adapt to these evolving preferences, by emphasizing jewelry\u2019s inherent value and meaning to build stronger connections with their current and target customers,\u201d he concluded.

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"ByChrissy Tracey  ByChrissy Tracey,  Contributor.  Oishii produces delicious strawberries using strategic vertical farming methods mixed with AI ... More integration. These strawberries are sweeter and more succulent than your typical store bought strawberry and can be enjoyed year round. \u201cAmerican strawberries may look perfect\u2013but they taste like water.\u201d That was the shocking realization Hiroki Koga, CEO and co-founder of Oishii, had when he moved from Japan to the U.S. in 2015. Having grown up eating vibrantly sweet, fragrant strawberries, he was stunned by the bland, mass-produced alternatives found in American grocery stores. \u201cI knew that if I could introduce premium Japanese varietal strawberries to the U.S., Americans would fall in love with their deliciously sweet, refreshing and unique flavor,\u201d Koga explains. That moment of frustration turned into Oishii, the company behind what might be the world\u2019s most meticulously grown strawberries. At Amatelas Farm, Oishii\u2019s newest and most advanced facility, bees, robots and engineers work in perfect synergy to produce sustainable, tech-driven strawberries. Through the precision of AI, efficiency of automation and an unwavering commitment to Japanese agricultural excellence, Oishii is single-handedly rewriting the future of farming. Amatelas Farm, located right outside of New York in Phillipsburg, New Jersey, opened in June 2024 and is Oishii\u2019s largest and smartest farm yet. Built in a repurposed plastic manufacturing facility, the farm is powered primarily by solar energy, operates with 95% water recycling and is outfitted with the latest energy-efficient LED technology. The price you pay for one of these delicious, vertically farmed strawberries is a reflection of the sustainability and dedication that goes into growing the juiciest and most delicious strawberries. Here\u2019s what sets it apart: \u201cWe are the only company that\u2019s been able to create the perfect indoor ecosystem for bees and naturally pollinated produce at this scale\u2013once widely thought to be impossible in the agriculture industry,\u201d said Koga. A farmer at one of the Oishii indoor growing facilities works meticulously to check the ripeness of ... More each strawberry before harvesting. It\u2019s clear that traditional farming is facing existential and unforeseen challenges. Climate instability, soil degradation, water shortages and labor scarcity are just a few of many. Oishii believes that controlled environment agriculture (CEA) is the answer. \u201cIt\u2019s a priority for us that our farm\u2019s continue to become more efficient, and we\u2019re focused on creating a sustainable solution for the challenges currently plaguing traditional agriculture,\u201d Koga explained. These sustainability efforts have attracted major investors, reinforcing Oishii\u2019s place as a leader in future forward farming.    While the trend towards vertical farming amongst Oishii\u2019s peers may appear to be slowing, Oishii is taking bold steps forward with a strategic acquisition of Tortuga AgTech\u2019s key teams, intellectual property and assets. What makes Tortuga AgTech so exciting is it\u2019s cutting-edge approach to some of agriculture\u2019s biggest challenges. They\u2019ve built one of the largest fleets of commercial harvesting robots in the world, capable of doing everything from picking fruit and performing trimming tasks to forecasting crop readiness and managing pests. By combining AI, robotics and plant-level data, Tortuga helps growers make smarter decisions and ultimately produce better food. The integration of Tortuga AgTech, a global leader in robotic harvesting and its advanced robotics technology, is the latest example of Oishii\u2019s category leadership. This acquisition will significantly enhance Oishii\u2019s efficiency, improve yield outcome and drive sustained growth. Though they are best known for their Omakase strawberries, Oishii isn\u2019t stopping at strawberries alone. The company has already introduced the Rubi tomato, a vertically farmed fruit that utilizes the same AI-driven farming methods. As automation and sensory-driven analytics refine crop production, the question remains; Can AI-grown produce replace traditional farming, or will it remain a luxury item? Oishii\u2019s berries, once priced at $50 per tray, now retail between $12-$15 making them increasingly accessible. However, scaling this model for staple crops remains a challenge. \u201cRight now, those premium products come at a higher price point, but as we introduce new innovations, we\u2019ve been able to continuously drop our pricing,\u201d Koga explained. The Koyo Berry by Oishii is known for it's refreshing sweetness, bright aroma, slight tartness and ... More firmer texture. Final Thoughts:   Oishii\u2019s success suggests that the future of farming may not be in the soil\u2013but in AI-powered greenhouses. As climate change accelerates and traditional farming faces mounting pressure, companies like Oishii are proving that technology can create efficient and extraordinary food. \u201cWe need to innovate and expand faster than ever to deliver on the rising demand from consumers and retail partners across the U.S. and beyond,\u201d Koga said. Oishii isn\u2019t just growing strawberries, they\u2019re reprogramming the future of flavor, one AI-powered berry at a time.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"Update March 27: This post is being  discussed on Hacker News For building a system of distributed services, one concept I think is very valuable to keep in mind is what I call the synchrony budget: as much as possible, a service should minimize the number of synchronous requests which it makes to other services. The reasoning behind this is two-fold: synchronous calls are costly. The more synchronous requests you are doing, the longer it will take to process inbound requests to your own service; users don\u2019t like to wait and might decide to take their business elsewhere if things take too long. Secondly, synchronous requests impact the availability of your service, because all the invoked services must be up and running in order for your service to work. The more services you rely on in a synchronous manner, the lower the availability of your service will be. Synchronous calls are tools that can help assure consistency, but by design they block progression until complete. In that sense, the idea of the synchrony budget is not about a literal budget which you can spend, but rather about being mindful how you implement communication flows between services: as asynchronous as possible, as synchronous as necessary. Let\u2019s make things a bit more tangible by looking at an example. Consider an e-commerce website where users can place purchase orders. When an order comes in, the order entry service needs to interact with a couple of other services in order to process that order: a payment service for processing the payment of the customer an inventory service for allocating stock of the purchased item a shipment service for triggering the fulfillment of the order Let\u2019s start with the last one, the shipment service. Does it matter to the customer who is placing an order when exactly the shipment service receives that notification? Not at all. Hence, notifying the shipment service synchronously from within the order entry request handler would be a waste of our synchrony budget. Not only would it cause that inbound request to take longer than it has to, it would also cause the order entry request to fail when the shipment service isn\u2019t available, for instance due to maintenance, a network split, or some other kind of failure. Also, we don\u2019t need to report any response from the shipment service back to the client making the inbound order placement request. This makes this call a perfect candidate for asynchronous execution, for instance by having the order service send a message to a Kafka topic, which then gets consumed by the shipment service. That way, the order service request isn\u2019t slowed down by awaiting a response from the shipment service, also a downtime of the shipment service won\u2019t affect the order service\u2019s availability. It will just process any pending messages from the Kafka topic when it is up again. In general, whenever one service solely needs to notify another service about something that happened, defaulting to asynchronous communication makes a lot of sense. In a similar spirit, if any changed data should be propagated from an OLTP data store to an OLAP system, this should be done asynchronously. By definition, analytical queries issued against the latter don\u2019t require instantaneous visibility into each single data change as it is occurring in the OLTP system. So sending synchronous requests to an OLAP store would be another good example for unnecessarily spending your synchrony budget. Now, what if our messaging infrastructure, such as Kafka, can\u2019t be reached? Aren\u2019t we back to square one? We might envision some means of buffering for that case, such as storing the messages to be sent in some local state store and sending them out once connectivity to Kafka has been restored. Luckily, we don\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel here: the outbox pattern is a well-established approach for channeling outgoing messages through a service\u2019s data store, transactionally consistent with any other data changes that need to be done at the same time. Tools for log-based change data capture (CDC), such as Debezium, can be used for extracting the messages from an outbox table with low overhead and high performance. That way, the only stateful resource which is required by a service to process incoming requests is its own database. Let\u2019s look at the communication with the inventory service next. When the order service processes an incoming request, it will require the information whether the specified item is available in the desired quantity. This differs from the notification semantics used for communicating with the shipment service, as we do need data from the inventory service in order to process the inbound request. So should we make a synchronous call in this case? It certainly could be an option, but again it would eat into our synchrony budget: there\u2019d be an impact on our response times, and what should we do in case the inventory service isn\u2019t available? Should the incoming request be failed? But not accepting customer requests because of some internal technical hick-up doesn\u2019t sound that desirable. Reversing the communication flow can be a way out: the inventory service could publish a feed of inventory changes, pushing a message to Kafka whenever there\u2019s an inventory update. The order service could subscribe to this feed and materialize a view of this data in its own local data store. That way, no synchronous calls between services are required when processing an order request, this can solely be done by querying the order service\u2019s database. The change feed of the inventory service could again be implemented via the outbox pattern; another option would be to use CDC for capturing changes in the actual business tables in the inventory database and then leverage stream processing, for instance with Apache Flink, to establish a stable data contract for that data stream. That way, consumers like the order service are shielded from any potentially disruptive changes to the shipment service\u2019s data model and the stream processor can handle denormalizing relational tables to provide consumers with fully contextualized events. Of course, there is a trade-off here: as updates to the order service\u2019s view of the inventory data happen asynchronously, we might run into a situation where that view is outdated and a request for an item gets accepted, while it actually is not in stock any more. In practice, Debezium and Kafka can propagate data changes with sub-second latency end-to-end, so the time window for errors will be very small during normal operation. But it also helps to take a step back and look at things from a business perspective: reality isn\u2019t transactional to begin with. I remember a birthday party a few years back where one of my friends was on call and had to patch the inventory table of an e-commerce application after a rack of flowers had been tossed over in the warehouse. In other words, a business needs to have means of dealing with situations like this in any case. In all likelihood, we\u2019ll be better off sending a customer a $10 voucher as an apology in the rare case of accepting an order for an item without inventory, instead of spending our synchrony budget and establishing a synchronous call flow for this process. Now, let\u2019s look at the communication with the payment service. Depending on the specifics, this one actually may be a case where a synchronous call is justified. When for instance building a flight booking system, you really want to be 100% sure that the credit card of the customer can be charged successfully, before acknowledging a booking request. Replicating the data of all credit cards and bank accounts in the world obviously isn\u2019t possible, so the call flow can\u2019t be reversed either. It\u2019s for a reason that payment processor APIs are built with extremely high availability in mind. And this is what the notion of the synchrony budget is about: implement inter-service calls asynchronously whenever it\u2019s possible, so you have the room to make synchronous calls if and when it\u2019s absolutely required. That being said, for an e-commerce application it may be actually feasible to make synchronous calls to the payment service by default, but fall back to asynchronous processing in case of failures. As the contract to sell typically only gets accepted when an item gets shipped, you still have the room to cancel an order if a payment falls through on the asynchronous processing path. Finally, here\u2019s how our overall solution of the data flows relevant to the order service could look like, applying the mental model of a synchrony budget:","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"Netflix (NFLX), originally a DVD rental service, sparked the streaming revolution when it launched its video streaming service in 2007. Nearly two decades later, it faces fierce competition from major media giants like Disney (DIS), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon Prime (AMZN). These companies are now all investing millions in original TV shows, battling for subscribers in an increasingly crowded market. Here are the 15 most expensive streaming series of all time. 2 \/ 11 The first eight-episode season of Netflix\u2019s 3 Body Problem, which debuted in 2024 cost about $20 million per episode. The sci-fi thriller was created by Game of Thrones showrunners David Benioff and D. B. Weiss and is based on a successful Chinese novel series. Meanwhile, the second season of Apple\u2019s buzziest show, \u201cSeverance,\u201d reportedly cost the tech giant $200 million or about $20 million per episode  3 \/ 11 Disney\u2019s Star Wars spinoff \u201cThe Acolyte,\u201d which premiered in 2024, was one of its most expensive. The eight-episode first season had a total budget of $180 million or about $22.5 million per episode. The show has since been cancelled. 4 \/ 11 The second season of \u201cLoki\u201d cost $141 million to produce, Forbes reported. With six episodes, that comes to about $23 million per episode. Loki is one of many spinoffs of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film franchise on this list. 5 \/ 11 The six-episode \u201cMoon Knight,\u201d another MCU spinoff, reportedly cost $147 million to make or about $24 million per episode. \u201cAndor,\u201d a prequel series to the Star Wars film Rogue One reportedly had a slightly higher budget than other Star Wars shows. The 12-episode first season cost $250 million to produce or about $20 million per episode. However, its second season had a budget of about $290 million, coming out to about $24 million per episode.  6 \/ 11 Disney+ first wave of MCU spinoffs were kicked off with \u201cWandaVision\u201d in 2021. The nine-episode miniseries cost up to $25 million per episode, like many of Disney\u2019s other MCU spinoffs including \u201cMs. Marvel,\u201d \u201cHawkeye,\u201d and \u201cThe Falcon and Winter Soldier.\u201d 7 \/ 11 Netflix is spending $30 million per episode on the fourth and final season of its popular series \u201cStranger Things.\u201d The show is set in the fictional Hawkins, Indiana during the 1980's. It follows a group of young friends as they encounter strange events following secret government experiments in their small town. 8 \/ 11 Disney spent $212 million to produce the MCU miniseries \u201cSecret Invasion.\u201d The budget for the 2023 six-episode miniseries came out to about $35.3 million per episode to make. 9 \/ 11 Amazon spent a whopping $300 million on the first season of its spy action show \u201cCitadel.\u201d The first season premiered in 2023 and was only six episodes, meaning each one cost about $50 million to produce. 10 \/ 11 The most expensive streaming series ever is Amazon\u2019s spinoff of the classic fantasy \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d books from J.R.R. Tolkien. The first eight-episode season of the show had a budget of $465 million, or $58 million per episode. 11 \/ 11","label":0}

The Huawei Mate XT Ultimate is the first \u2013 and so far only \u2013 tri-foldable on the market. Others have shown prototypes, but Huawei is ahead of the curve on this one. Yes, the device itself is frighteningly expensive (\u20ac3,500!), but bleeding edge tech is always like that. We have a detailed review of the XT Ultimate if you want to know more. Long story short, the device delivers what it promises \u2013 a state-of-the-art mechanical design, an immersive 10.2\u201d display and an impressive camera system. However, it is held back by the usual problems of current-day Huawei \u2013 the company is cut off from the global chip supply and from US-based services like Google Play. It\u2019s a political issue rather than a technological one, but an issue nonetheless.     Huawei Mate XT Ultimate In terms of competition for the Huawei Mate XT Ultimate, there is none \u2013 this really is the only such device on the market. Compared to Huawei\u2019s own Mate X6, the XT offers a 10.2\u201d display unfolded in a body that folds down to 12.8mm and weighs 298g. The X6 is thinner and lighter at 9.9mm and 239g, but only has a 7.93\u201d inner display with 36% smaller surface area. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Fold6 packs an even smaller 7.6\u201d display inside a body that is 12.1mm thick and weighs 239g. The Z Fold Special is thinner at 10.6mm but only 3g lighter \u2013 this should be close to what we see from the upcoming Z Fold7.     Huawei Mate X6 \u2022 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold6 \u2022 Oppo Find N5 Samsung is teasing a tri-fold device with a 9.96\u201d internal display, but it\u2019s not clear whether it will be widely available (rumors point to a limited production run). The Oppo Find N5 is impressively slim at 8.9mm folded, but weight remains relatively high at 229g. This is with an 8.12\u201d internal display. Looking at unfolded sections, Huawei managed to get the thinnest down to 3.6mm, while N5\u2019s thinnest segment measures 4.2mm. What do you think about the Huawei Mate XT Ultimate \u2013 would you like to own one or something like it? It is the future and other companies will start copying. \r  The reason why I voted \"All foldables are gimmicks\" is because they're more than proportionately expensive, heavy and huge for now. \r And there's not much of a use case for it, maybe 1. on-table presentations and 2. bragging right... what?

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  The iQunix Magi65 is a great keyboard for low profile fans. It\u2019s intentionally designed to offer the best typing experience in the market. While that\u2019s obviously subjective, and portability isn\u2019t its forte, it offers a great typing experience, superb build quality, and a unique sense of style. Great typing experience Excellent build quality Integrated media controls Unique style Can\u2019t be used on a laptop\u2019s keyboard deck Metal build hinders portability  Why you can trust Tom's Hardware     Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.  iQunix is a brand that, for a long time, seemed to exist behind the scenes \u2014 you had to be in the know to recognize its name. Over the last couple of years, it has come into the mainstream in a big way, delivering some of the most interesting and high-quality pre-built keyboards available. So far its keyboards have all been full-height and fairly traditional to use, albeit with interesting designs and layouts. The Magi65 Pro breaks that trend. The Magi65 Pro is the company's first foray into the world of low-profile keyboards. Not content to simply deliver a traditional LP that would suit laptop users and fans of chiclet keys, it instead set out to directly challenge its biggest competitors. In true iQunix fashion, the Magi65 Pro has a unique style, excellent build quality, premium components, and offers a great typing experience. Available in Standard ($119) and Pro ($139) versions, this keyboard offers great bang for the buck with only a few trade-offs. Switches iQunix Gold Red Lighting Per-key RGB Onboard Storage 5 Layers Media Keys Yes Connectivity USB Type-A, 2.4GHz, Bluetooth 5.1 Cable 6 feet, braided Additional Ports None Keycaps Dye-sublimated PBT plastic Software VIA Materials Aluminum case, PBT keycaps Dimensions (LxWxH) 14.1 x 4.3 x 0.43 inches Weight 2.27 lbs (1030g) The Magi65 comes in two versions. The standard MG65 uses a traditional 65-percent layout. This means that it lacks a function row but includes dedicated arrow keys and a column of navigation and editing buttons. The MG65 Pro, however, includes an extra section on the right with a volume knob, RGB strip, a four-way media controller, and a neat magnetic storage compartment for its 2.4GHz wireless dongle. The button layout of each version is exactly the same. It's a condensed rectangle without any space between its different sections of keys. The button area measures roughly 12 inches by 4 inches and is good for saving desk space, though if you choose the MG65 Pro you'll obviously have an extra couple of inches to consider on the right for its extra features. Like most low-profile mechanical keyboards, the keys are entirely flat for improved ergonomics, and carry a small learning curve if you\u2019re used to a sculpted profile.  All it takes is a glance to see that the Magi65 is a unique keyboard. The keycaps are colored to match either the Shadow Black or Ochre White themes. I was sent the black version, which has white legends with copper-toned sub-legends. There's a copper colored metal accent key, and on the right in the multimedia section, the track controls are in the form of a copper-colored, rounded-off \u201cX.\u201d There is per-key RGB lighting as well as some stylish patterning on the dongle cover and the back. Flip it over and you'll find that the feet are small-but-chubby black X's and that the keyboard has a separate but matching weight with grid lines across its surface.  Pick it up \u2014 or, better yet, type on it \u2014 and you'll see even more how set-apart this keyboard actually is compared to other low profile options. The case is made entirely of metal, and though it's small, weighs just under 2.3 pounds. It won't be sliding around on your desk anytime soon. Given its weight and those X-styled feet, you also won't be using it directly on top of your laptop's keyboard deck anytime soon, either. It certainly feels high quality, but at the same time its weight works against it. The keyboard supports crime-free old wireless connectivity with Bluetooth 5.1 (up to three devices), and 2.4GHz wireless for gaming-grade latency. It's not the kind of keyboard I would personally want to carry in a bag, however: It weighs half as much as many productivity laptops, and it's heavy enough that you'll certainly feel its addition in a messenger bag or backpack. Despite these somewhat contentious choices, I see what iQunix was going for here, and I like it. It's not the most portable low-profile keyboard in the world, but clearly isn't intended to be. Instead, this strikes me as more of an enthusiast option for fans of the low-profile design.  This design inspiration becomes even more evident when you dig into its details. The keycaps, for example, are made of thick, dye-sublimated PBT plastic. This gives them increased durability over time, greater resistance to oils, and a deeper sound signature when typing quickly. The Gold Red switches are pre-lubed and are also clearly tuned for a rounded, pleasant sound profile. There are multiple layers of sound-dampening and sound-enhancing foam. Even the FR4 plate has obviously been selected for its mix of balanced sound and somewhat flexible structure. Unlike many full-height enthusiast mechanical keyboards and the Lofree Flow, one of its key competitors, the MG65 Pro doesn\u2019t use a gasket mount structure to soften its keystrokes. Instead, it uses a modified tray mount structure, which iQunix calls Le-Tray mount. Instead of screwing directly into the bottom case, the four mounting poles are covered with a silicone sleeve to reduce vibrations. Opting for only four mounting points seems like an intentional decision, because it preserves a bit of flex in the typing experience. Given that the keyboard is only half an inch thick, it is impressive \u2014 and, more importantly, comfortable.  The switches are also hot-swappable. This is a great feature to see, but it doesn't have the same level of utility as it would on a full-height custom keyboard. This is because low-profile switches are not as standardized, or interchangeable, as MX-style switches. But there are alternatives to be found, and more options will inevitably continue to arrive in the future. To support its wireless functionality, the keyboard ships with a 3000-mAh battery. iQunix quotes this at 300 hours over Bluetooth, without RGB backlighting. I've been testing it for around a month with intermittent lighting use, and I haven't had to recharge it yet. Typically I would consider this kind of measurement misleading because backlighting can be integral to the appearance and low-light functionality of many keyboards. But while it certainly enhances its look, I found that the keyboard looked good enough on its own \u2014 so turning it off wasn\u2019t such a big deal. The legends on the keycaps are also not backlit, so you're not sacrificing visibility. The MG65 and MG65 Pro are only available with iQunix's own Gold Red switches. This is a linear switch with a 45-gram actuation force, making it similar to a Cherry MX Red in weight. The company doesn't share any specifics about its other specs, such as the travel distance or the material used, but they offer generous travel that I would peg at around 3mm. A standard cherry switch has a travel distance of 4mm, while some low-profile switches, like the Kailh Choc V2s, can be as shallow as 1.3mm. This makes the MG65 Pro a middle ground between full-height key travel and typical low-profile key travel. In practical terms, it means that it feels much closer to a normal mechanical keyboard than what you might imagine a keyboard with an 11mm front height might. As someone who hates the ultra shallowness of older, low-profile keys, the iQunix is a pretty great alternative in this style.  Typing on the keyboard feels good. The keys are comfortable and reasonably well cushioned, thanks to the limited mounting points, silicone wrapping on each and the flexible FR4 plate. The switches are smooth, and the added travel made climbing the learning curve of the completely flat profile easier than I found it to be on some competitors. In smoothness and comfort to use, it is right on par with the low-profile flow and Nuphy\u2019s latest Air V2 keyboards. iQunix really highlights the keyboard\u2019s construction and its impact on sound and feel. Sound-wise, I would still give a slight edge to the Lofree Flow because of its all POM switches and gasket mounting structure. It's so subjective, and the sound profiles are so close, that you would have to be an enthusiast with an ear for nuance to draw hard conclusions on which is \"better.\" The Magi65 Pro sits in good company. It is at least as good as the Nuphy Air V2 series, and is separated from the Lofree Flow, which is what I consider to be the best sounding, best feeling low profile keyboard available today. In a nutshell, the typing experience is excellent. It's a great middle ground between full-height and low-profile keyboards, and it both sounds and feels better than most of its low profile competitors (excepting the two named here).  The Magi65 Pro is not a gaming keyboard, but it can certainly be used as one. The 2.4GHz wireless connection offers a full 1,000 Hz polling rate, which is equivalent to 1ms of latency. This is still the standard for most wired gaming keyboards, so you can game with confidence, knowing that you won\u2019t take a loss because your keyboard wasn\u2019t as ready as you were. I've been playing a lot of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, as well as Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and the MG65 worked perfectly. It's not an 8K keyboard, and frankly, it doesn't need to be. The smooth, linear switches were perfect for reacting to what was happening in the game. Allowing me to forget that I was using a low-profile keyboard and not one of my regular customs or dedicated gaming keyboards. I'm not a big macro user, but I would be remiss if I didn't highlight that the keyboard\u2019s gaming capabilities are enhanced by how easily and deeply programmable it is. Recording macros and creating custom layouts for individual games is easy and, if you want it to be, completely software-free. The Magi65 uses VIA for all of its programming. VIA is an open-source programming tool popular within the enthusiast community. It can either be run locally on your computer or accessed through a website to make changes on the go. It provides all of the functionality you would expect without going into the same level of complexity and polish that most gaming gaming software suites do, but it's a fantastic tool that gives you plenty of options to program your keyboard exactly as you would like it, without needing to actually install anything on your host PC.  VIA offers full control over all of your keymaps, allows you to record macros, and also allows you to customize and control the keyboard's lighting. All of your keymaps and macros can be assigned across four layers. Think of these like virtual keyboards that can be accessed by holding a button of your choice.  Everything is unlocked, meaning that you can assign any key, including function keys, anywhere you like. These layers can also be accessed in different ways \u2014 for example, holding, tapping, or even assigning a dual-function key where holding it accesses a layer while tapping it sends the original function. While this does take a while to get used to, once you learn its capabilities, it offers a deep ability to customize the keyboard to your exact workflow. It can also be quite useful for gaming. Assigning macros follows the usual process of pressing a record button, sending your inputs, and then mapping that macro to a key. We're not losing much functionality here; however, it's not quite as in-depth as something like Razer Synapse. You can't insert custom events, for example, but you can adjust the delays between commands to make sure they function properly in your game of choice.  Being able to map multiple layers of commands is very useful in games as well. Using this system, you can have custom key maps for up to three different games and applications. If you do need to make changes, it's as simple as going to the website, tapping the key you want to change, and choosing what you would like there instead.The biggest limitation comes down to the RGB backlighting. While you are able to choose from a wide range of preset animations, as well as set your exact hue and saturation for many of them, there is currently no easy way to assign per-key lighting schemes.  The iQunix Magi65 Pro is a great option for anyone considering a low-profile keyboard who also wants a top-tier typing experience. It's not exactly the most portable, which could be a deal-breaker \u2014 it\u2019s one of the biggest reasons many people consider a low profile keyboard in the first place \u2014 but the trade-off in portability is exceptional build quality, typing, and aesthetics. It's the kind of keyboard that makes you want to keep using it, which is about the biggest compliment any keyboard can earn. If you do need something a little more portable, the Lofree Flow and Lofree Edge are two excellent options that are thinner and lighter, and still offer great sound and feel. They\u2019re a bit more expensive, however, so if you\u2019re not up for spending that much, the Nuphy Air60 V2 and Air75 V2 are also great options. None of the competition offers quite the same blend of build quality and aesthetics, however, which makes the Magi65 Pro well worth a closer look all on its own.

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"Tech companies racing to secure power for their data centers have struck dozens of secretive electricity deals with utilities that could cost average Americans a \"staggering\" amount, Harvard research found. With data center construction on the rise and utility costs top-of-mind for many Americans, the Harvard Electricity Law Initiative reviewed 40 special contracts that state regulators have approved between utilities and data centers. If these contracts offer discounted electricity rates to data centers, and new power grid infrastructure is needed to serve them, other customers may end up paying for the shortfall through higher utility bills. But it's nearly impossible to know the exact price tag of any cost shifts because the terms of these special contracts are hidden from public view, the report found. State regulators usually approve utilities' requests for confidentiality, limiting public scrutiny. That means billion-dollar contracts are getting approved without a transparent accounting of the costs and benefits, researchers said. \"When we have potentially billions of dollars going through these secret contracts where there's just not a lot of investigation about what's going on, we think there's reason to be suspicious that utilities may be offering discounts that are subsidized by everybody else,\" said Ari Peskoe, director of The Harvard Electricity Law Initiative and coauthor of the paper with Eliza Martin, a legal fellow. The report lands as data center construction is booming, in part to serve Big Tech's artificial intelligence race. Some AI data center complexes need as much power as entire cities and by 2028, the industry could account for 12% of US electricity consumption \u2014 up from 4% in 2023, according to federal estimates. The trend is leading some citizens, state policymakers, and at least one utility to try to shield households from rising bills. Utilities and tech companies have told Business Insider that the contracts they negotiate should cover the costs of any power grid upgrades required to serve data centers. Lucas Fykes, director of energy policy for the Data Center Coalition, which represents companies including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft, and Meta, said in an emailed statement that the industry is committed to paying its full cost of service. Fykes added that the Harvard research overlooks a finding in Virginia \u2014 the world's largest data center market \u2014 that the industry is paying the appropriate costs for its energy use. In December, an independent study commissioned by Virginia's Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission found that rates \"appropriately allocate costs to the customers responsible for incurring them, including data center customers.\" The report also said that data centers' increased energy demand will likely increase costs for everyone, including residents and businesses. A large amount of new power plants and transmission lines will be built that otherwise wouldn't be needed, if not for data centers. A typical residential customer in Virginia could see an extra $14 to $37 each month on their utility bill by 2040. The report said creating a separate category for data centers and changing the way costs are allocated across customers could help insulate households from statewide cost increases. Peskoe recommended greater scrutiny and regulation of special contracts, as well. \"We didn't realize how extensive these secret contracts were,\" Peskoe said. \"The more we dug, the more we kept finding.\" State and federal regulators allow most utilities to spread the cost of power grid upgrades across their customer base. This is typically done through what's known as a rate case increase, a lengthy and public process at state public utility commissions. Consumer advocates, environmental and industrial groups, and other outside parties regularly intervene. By contrast, most of the special contracts that Peskoe and Martin reviewed were approved by public utility commissions with \"only cursory analysis\" and little or no public evidence to back up claims that data center energy costs would be isolated from other customers' bills. While regulators in many states are required to protect the public from \"cutthroat\" practices that harm ratepayers, Peskoe said he's skeptical. Peskoe said state regulators can face political pressure to approve big economic investments already touted by elected officials for their economic impacts. He added that utilities have a long history of \"exploiting their monopolies\" to attract competitive lines of business. Peskoe pointed to an antitrust lawsuit that a small non-profit utility brought against Duke Energy. Court documents revealed that Duke offered Fayetteville, North Carolina, a special contract with a $325 million discount and acknowledged that it would lose $100 million on the deal, but planned to recoup those losses by raising rates on other customers. Duke Energy, which argued its conduct was legitimate price competition and lawful, petitioned the Supreme Court to review the case in February. Duke declined to comment, and the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group that represents investor-owned utilities, didn't return a request for comment. While the case doesn't involve data centers, Peskoe said it illustrates how utilities compete for big energy customers and can hide how they pass those costs onto other customers. The Harvard study said states could have stricter rules for special contracts, similar to those in Kentucky, where public utility commissioners only allow utilities to offer discounted rates for five years, and there must be more than enough power supply available on the system. The rate also must exceed the utility's costs to serve the customer, the study said. Have a tip or a story to share?

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"Business Insider Edition  A corner of the exchange-traded and mutual fund market has seen a quiet surge in recent years, which investing pros say has come alongside the rise of Donald Trump and a reinvigoration of religious sentiment during his two terms as president.  Faith-based investments are a relatively small part of the ETF world, but investors \u2014 typically of Christian or Catholic faith \u2014 piled into these vehicles in the last year, many of which promise to keep money out of anything with links to things like abortion, tobacco, or gambling.               The value of faith-based investments swelled to at least $130 billion last year, but the total size of the market is likely larger than that, according to a study from the faith-based investment advisory Brightlight.               According to Brightlight's survey, assets managed by faith-based funds hit $100 billion for the first time last year, a 14% jump in the 15 months leading up to June 2024.               Brightlight has also seen more people seek its investment advisory services in the last year. Demand for the firm's screening services, which filter stocks for faith-based values, has doubled since 2023, the firm told BI.       Inspire, which claims to be the world's largest faith-based ETF provider, has also seen a surge of interest in its faith-based investment products.               The company's investing arm hit $3 billion in assets under management last year, with $1 billion of that coming in the 18 months leading up to September, it said in a statement.               Inspire CEO Robert Netzly said he sees rising religious fervor behind the surge in interest in faith-based investing.               \"There's opening the eyes of His people to this huge problem, that we've been putting His money into things that break His heart. Things like human trafficking and abortion, drug manufacturing and all sorts of things. And we don't have to do that anymore,\" he said.       Guidestone, another faith-based investment firm, also said it's seeing greater demand for its investment products. The firm has $22.5 billion in assets under management, up around 46% over the last three years, according to statements and information on its website.               There are funds tailored to the values of many religions, but Christians, Catholics, and evangelicals make up the bulk of the investors working with Inspire and Brightlight, Netzly and Brightlight head of global advisory, Tim Macready, told BI.               Investing strategies can also differ from client to client, but generally, the funds aim to steer money away from things that are against a client's religious principles, while allocating to investments that comply with their faith.               Real estate tends to be a popular investment, as many clients believe community development aligns with their religious principles. Meanwhile, companies with any links to abortion, alcohol, gambling, pornography, or child labor are avoided, Macready said.               Since many faith-based funds typically screen out companies on the no-buy list, many have underperformed the broader market in the past year. Inspire's flagship Inspire 100 ETF (ticker: BIBL), for instance, doesn't hold any of the Magnificent Seven stocks.               Yet, while the fund may have missed out on last year's big gains for the cohort, it is actually beating the market in 2025 after avoiding the rout in mega-cap tech this year. As of Friday afternoon, the ETF is down about 1% year-to-date compared to the S&P 500's 3.8% decline.               Religious investors, though, are more focused on their faith than beating the market, Netzly said.               \"There really is a movement going on that we believe is from God,\" he added. \"So certainly if we can eat our breakfast to the glory of God, we can invest millions, billions, trillions of dollars in the Christian market.\"               Investors BI spoke to attributed the boom in these types of investments to God's wish, but the rise in faith-based investing also coincides with Trump's time in the White House.               Phillip Dickson, the CEO of Monorail, an investment service that supports faith- and values-based investing, said clients became \"more bullish for sure\" after Trump won the November election.               Trump drew strong support from white evangelical Protestant voters, with 81% saying they would vote for Trump over Biden. Trump himself said he identifies as a nondenominational Christian in 2020.               Macready said he believed the rising popularity of faith-based funds has to do with the shifting political landscape in the US.               \"Faith-based investors have become much more vocal on, again, the conservative side of things,\" he said, pointing to a generally unified stance against partisan issues like abortion.               Netzley said he noticed that many faith-based investors are pro-Trump, and said he expected the president's policies to boost the companies Inspire invests in.               \"People of faith by large margins voted for Trump, not because he's a Christian, but because his policies tend to be favorable towards people of faith,\" Netzley said. \"So it's certainly exciting to us to consider that, to start to see that show up in returns.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"  In the late, great Larry Cohen's\u00a01974 horror classic \"It's Alive,\" Frank (John P. Ryan) and his wife Lenore (Sharon Farrell) have just had their second child ... and it's a monster. Their baby was born with fangs and claws, as well as increased dexterity and an unhuman lust for violence. As soon as the baby is born, it kills the nurses and scurries away through a skylight. The bulk of the film is a gruesome manhunt ... er, babyhunt ... wherein Frank and the local police track the killer baby through the streets, through a school, and eventually into the sewers. The baby murders people at each stop. It's posited along the way that the baby was mutated by the birth control pills still in Lenore's system when she was pregnant, and that the pharmaceutical company that made the pills is liable for any damage the mutant baby does. The Big Pharma character is more determined than anyone to kill the monster child.\u00a0 \"It's Alive\" was a hit, making over $7 million on a $500,000 budget. It has since moved favorably into horror-fan and cult circles, where it is widely beloved by weirdos and gorehounds. The killer baby concept was repeated in Cohen's 1978 sequel \"It Lives Again,\" and the 1987 follow-up \"It's Alive III: Island of the Alive.\" Larry Cohen was a master at way-way-out-there exploitation movies that were strange even compared to those of his contemporaries. Cohen's stories were always notable and ambitious and striking original. \"It's Alive\" was eventually remade in 2009 as a straight-to-video release, directed by Joe Rusnak (\"The Thirteenth Floor\") and starring Bijou Phillips in the Sharon Farrell role.\u00a0 It seems that James Gunn, however, was once interested in doing that remake. Back in 2017, two years before his death, Cohen talked to IndieWire about his prolific horror output, and he casually dropped the bomb that Gunn, currently a high-profile stalwart of superhero cinema, tried to buy the remake rights to \"It's Alive\" years earlier.\u00a0   Gunn, to remind readers, is currently the chief muckety-muck over at DC Studios, and he is overseeing\/writing\/directing a large spate of big-budget movies intended to launch a brand-new superhero cinematic universe. Gunn, however, used to be a punk. He started his career writing goopy horror\/comedies and superhero satires; better than any of his \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" movies is Lloyd Kaufman's 1996 Shakespeare trash epic \"Tromeo & Juliet.\" Gunn also penned the remake of \"Dawn of the Dead\" and the not-good-but-well-remembered \"Scooby-Doo\" movies from the early-'00s. It's unusual that his stock-in-trade should be superheroes, as he pretty much dismantled the very concept of superheroes in films like \"The Specials\" and \"Super.\"\u00a0 Cohen doesn't say what Gunn intended to do with \"It's Alive,\" but he does recall that Gunn couldn't afford the remake rights to his movie. He said briefly:\u00a0 \"James Gunn is a fan and a friend. He wanted to make a remake of 'It's Alive,' actually, but he couldn't raise enough money to buy the rights. I'm sorry today I didn't give them to him. But he's beyond that now.\"\u00a0 Cohen's statement implies that Gunn wanted to remake \"It's Alive\" before he found massive success with \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" in 2014. The actual timeline of Gunn's potential \"It's Alive\" film is unclear, however, and no script has been revealed.\u00a0 It was, of course, only one of Gunn's many, many unrealized projects. Over his career, Gunn has written \u2014 or was merely asked to write \u2014 several pop culture adaptations that never made it to fruition. Gunn was asked to write a script for a Silver Surfer movie way back in 1999, about the same time he was working on a \"Spy vs. Spy\" movie, and a horror version of \"Gilligan's Island.\" Gunn had a hand in scripting a Plastic Man movie, a \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\" remake, and a reboot of \"Starsky & Hutch.\"\u00a0 It seems that the remake of \"It's Alive\" is just one that Gunn had to throw on the pile.","label":0}

Find this story in your account\u2019s \u2018Saved for Later\u2019 section.                     For most of its existence, Tesla being synonymous with Elon Musk has been an asset for the company. Though the world\u2019s richest man was often embroiled in weird public scandals, customers and investors largely waved off the CEO\u2019s behavior and continued to adore Tesla \u2014 presuming that the benefits Musk brought were worth the cost. Those days are long gone. First Musk bought a social-media network and made it his own vindictive right-wing playground. Then he went \u201cdark MAGA\u201d and spent more money than anyone else to reelect Donald Trump. Then he became Trump\u2019s top adviser, invented a job for himself atop DOGE, and began gleefully swinging a chainsaw at the federal government and its workforce. Tesla has been paying the price, and the bad news just keeps coming for the struggling company and the billionaire anchor around its neck. Below is an overview of everything that\u2019s now going wrong for Tesla, both Musk-linked and not. . The value of Telsa stock initially went way up following Trump\u2019s election, reaching an all-time high in mid-December, but it has now crashed back to about where it was before the election. Before Monday\u2019s rally, Tesla shares had suffered nine straight weeks of losses, and had lost roughly half their value since the December peak (and more than 40 percent since Trump\u2019s inauguration). Though Tesla shares are still worth more than they were for most of last year, the sudden skid and volatility has spooked Tesla loyalists and prompted a new era of uncertainty about the company for many investors. . The most visible of Elon Musk\u2019s companies, Tesla has become the focal point of anti-Musk activism. For weeks, protesters have been holding peaceful demonstrations outside Tesla showrooms around the country. Many of the protests have been affiliated with a grassroots movement called Tesla Takedown, which is attempting to organize over 500 more protests on March 29 as part of a \u201cglobal day of action.\u201d The group calls for a boycotts of Tesla as well as divestment from the company as a way to oppose Musk\u2019s political activities. It\u2019s just one of the groups that has risen up to organize opposition to Musk through activism against Tesla. In the U.K., at least two anti-Musk groups have been posting guerrilla advertisements in London and other cities calling Musk a Nazi or relabeling Tesla \u201cthe swasticar.\u201d A fake Tesla ad has been spotted in East London:\u201cThe Swasticar\u201d pic.twitter.com\/tkHmdn85v4 There has also been violence against the demonstrations. On Saturday, outside a Tesla dealership in West Palm Beach, Florida, a man was arrested after driving his SUV into a crowd of anti-Musk protesters. At the same time, a growing number of Tesla dealerships and charging stations have been targeted with vandalism and arson attacks, including at least 80 reported incidents in the U.S. and Canada. Most of the incidents seem to have been perpetrated at night by lone offenders, according to the FBI. So far, no injuries have been reported. On March 24, multiple incendiary devices were found at a Tesla showroom in Austin, Texas. On March 4, several Tesla charging stations were set ablaze outside Boston. In Las Vegas on March 17, an unknown assailant used Molotov cocktails to set several vehicles on fire at a Tesla service center; three bullet holes were found in the vehicles as well. There have been multiple attacks on Tesla properties in Oregon in recent months. Eighty Tesla vehicles were scratched or had their tires punctured at a dealership in London, Ontario, on March 18. A dozen vehicles were burned outside a Tesla dealership in Toulouse, France, on March 2. These are just some of reported incidents. Last week, the Trump administration vowed a crackdown on anyone attacking Tesla properties, describing the incidents as \u201cdomestic terrorism.\u201d Musk and other Trump officials have alleged that the attacks are being coordinated, but there is no evidence of that. . Tesla owners are getting caught in the anti-Musk crossfire as well. According to news reports and images shared on social media, individual Tesla vehicles have been targeted and vandalized in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and multiple other countries. In some cases, people have carved swastikas or messages into the vehicles or thrown things at them. Activists have also attached anti-Musk flyers to cars, and some Tesla drivers have reported being screamed at or harassed. Many Tesla owners have added anti-Musk and anti-Trump bumper stickers to their vehicles in an attempt to distance themselves and their cars from the billionaire and his politics, but it\u2019s not clear if that\u2019s helped anyone avoid vandalism or harassment. It\u2019s also possible that if the Tesla-vandalism trend continues or worsens, it could drive up auto-insurance rates for Tesla drivers \u2014 and Tesla is already one of the most expensive car brands to insure. . Tesla\u2019s sales and registrations have been dropping in the U.S., Canada, and Europe \u2014 even while overall sales of EVs have gone up. Tesla is still the top-selling brand of EVs in America, but its U.S. sales have been in steady decline for months. The only country in Europe in which Tesla sales have gone up recently is the U.K. Sales of Tesla cars in February fell off a cliff in Germany, France, Sweden, Portugal, and Italy. China\u2019s Passenger Car Association reported that Tesla sales fell by almost half in February. On March 25, Reuters reported that Tesla sold fewer than 17,000 cars in the European Union, European Free Trade Association member countries and Britain last month. In February 2024, the company sold more than 28,000 vehicles. . YouGov has been tracking the American public\u2019s impression of the Tesla brand since 2016, and as of mid-March, it was at the lowest point it\u2019s ever been, Sherwood\u2019s Rani Molla reported: Only among conservatives does Tesla have a positive net-impression score, at about 7. For comparison, Americans\u2019 average net impression of all carmakers is quite a bit higher, at 17. Tesla\u2019s net impression among moderates is -9 and a lowly -35 among liberals. Populationwide, Tesla is at -12.8, the lowest on record. Americans\u2019 impression of Tesla has tanked to its lowest level ever among liberals, moderates and the general population, according to new data from @YouGov https:\/\/t.co\/9wx1txGO7J pic.twitter.com\/ThPhTkNrDr . On March 11, hours after following the worst-ever day of Tesla stock sell-offs, President Trump announced on Truth Social that he was going to buy a brand-new Tesla. Hours later, Trump and Musk tried to create a hilariously unethical Tesla commercial outside the White House. The company delivered five vehicles to the White House, where they were lined up at the South Portico. Trump and Musk then staged a press event, livestreamed on Musk\u2019s X, in which Trump defended and praised Musk, expressed his admiration for the vehicles, and literally read a Tesla sales pitch: Trump ultimately said that he would buy a red Model S. As he climbed into the $80,000 vehicle along with Musk, he exclaimed, \u201cWow, that\u2019s beautiful \u2026 Everything\u2019s computer!\u201d Musk to Trump: It\u2019s a like a golf cart that goes really fast Trump: This is really amazing pic.twitter.com\/vkqHlEUyWT Trump and Musk also decried the attacks on Tesla, which the president called a \u201cgreat American company.\u201d Later that day, Trump said he thought his endorsement could quickly double Tesla\u2019s sales. Though Tesla\u2019s stock value was up for about a week afterward, there\u2019s so far no evidence of a Trump bump in Tesla sales. Several market analysts continued to opine that Musk\u2019s political activities and alignment with Trump were doing Tesla more harm than good. One of the most traditionally bullish Tesla investors said as much in a warning to the company: \u201cTesla is becoming a political symbol of Trump and DOGE, and that is a bad thing for the brand,\u201d cautioned Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. \u201cYou think it\u2019s helping, but it\u2019s actually hurting.\u201d . Last Wednesday night during an appearance on Fox News, Trump\u2019s billionaire Commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, sang Elon Musk\u2019s praises and urged viewers to buy the Tesla dip. \u201cI think if you want to learn something on this show tonight, buy Tesla,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that this guy\u2019s stock is this cheap. It\u2019ll never be this cheap again.\u201d Lutnick, whom Musk tried to pressure Trump to name Treasury secretary during the transition, called Musk the \u201cbest entrepreneur and technologist in America\u201d and \u201cprobably the best person to bet on I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick tells Fox viewers to buy Tesla stock pic.twitter.com\/t0syL32sa3 His comments were, of course, an enormous breach of ethics \u2014 and almost certainly illegal \u2014 though not surprising behavior from the Trump administration. Tesla stock again fell the next day. . Despite a brief uptick after the 2024 election, U.S. demand for Tesla\u2019s polarizing electric truck has been in steady decline since September. According to data from Cox Automotive, the Cybertruck is still the top-selling electric truck in America, but sales fell by almost a third from January to February. InsideEVs reports: Cybertruck sales in the U.S. dropped by 32.5 percent between January and February to an estimated 2,619 units, according to data provided to InsideEVs by\u00a0Cox Automotive. Last month, Tesla sold roughly half as many Cybertrucks as it did during the model\u2019s best month of sales in September, the firm estimates. Not exactly an ideal outcome for a vehicle that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly called the brand\u2019s \u201cbest product ever.\u201d According to Electrek, Tesla is poised to deliver significantly lower numbers of Cybertrucks this quarter than it did in the previous two, despite introducing several new sales incentives: [Tesla has confirmed] that it made and delivered 46,000 Cybertrucks in the U.S. since launching production in late 2023. By comparing them to previous numbers, it means that Tesla is only going to deliver between 7,000 and 8,000 Cybertrucks in Q1 2025. That would be significantly down from the last two quarters when Tesla is estimated to have delivered between 10,000 and 12,000 Cybertrucks.  It is a bad look considering the Cybertruck gained access to the $7,500 federal tax credit\u00a0for electric vehicles this quarter, and\u00a0Tesla started to discount the truck with free Supercharger\u00a0and\u00a0subsidized financing rates. The lower financing rate is equivalent to slashing thousands of dollars off of the Cybertruck. Tesla also launched its\u00a0Cybertruck lease program last month and offered free wraps on Foundations Series. If deliveries are dropping even with those new incentives, it\u2019s a clear sign that the Cybertruck program is in distress. The resale value of Cybertrucks has dropped significantly, as well. . On Thursday, Tesla announced a voluntary recall of pretty much every Cybertruck it has sold in the U.S. (nearly 46,100 vehicles) to repair exterior trim panels that could come unglued and fly off while the vehicle is moving, posing a potential road hazard to other drivers. It\u2019s the eighth NHTSA recall for the Cybertruck since its launch in 2023, and it\u2019s the second recall pertaining to detaching trim (though the earlier one only applied to roughly 11,000 vehicles). . As my colleague John Herrman recently explained, popular tech and science YouTubers once played a critical role in helping to bolster Tesla\u2019s reputation (and it was a mutually beneficial relationship). But recently some top YouTubers have begun treating Musk, Tesla, and specifically the Cybertruck more like a joke: That a handful of loosely affiliated popular YouTubers have adjusted their strategies around Tesla may not be hugely significant on its own. But if we\u2019re suddenly interested in who young men are\u00a0listening to online, YouTube\u2019s cheery and mostly politics-averse ecosystem of tech and science personalities should be in the conversation. Their intuitions about their influential sector of the attention economy say something. Tesla used to be good for business. Now, it\u2019s a little more complicated than that. . According to Edmunds\u2019 data analysis from the first half of March, Tesla vehicles made up a higher percentage of trade-ins toward new or used purchases at non-Tesla dealerships than ever before. That doesn\u2019t necessarily mean all of those Tesla owners were trading in their vehicles for non-Tesla alternatives (some may be trading up for a newer model Tesla), but it\u2019s another potential signal of declining brand loyalty. During the first half of March, Tesla vehicles made up 1.4 percent of all trade-ins toward new or used vehicles at U.S. dealerships that don\u2019t sell direct to consumers (like Tesla does). That\u2019s up from 0.4 percent during the same period a year ago, and up from 1.2 percent in February. Explained Edmunds\u2019 Jessica Caldwell to Reuters: \u201cBrand loyalty is becoming a bigger question mark as factors such as Elon Musk\u2019s increasing public involvement in government, Tesla depreciation concerns, and its increased saturation in major metro areas leave some longtime owners feeling disconnected from the brand.\u201d The increase in trade-ins will likely drive used Tesla prices down as well, according to Edmunds\u2019 analysis, which is part of another problem. . Per used-car-sales data from CarGurus, the average used price of a Tesla dropped at an alarming rate over the past three months, InsideEVs reported last week: Used Teslas are depreciating at\u00a0three times the rate of other automakers. The data shows that used Teslas have fallen an average of -7.26 percent year over year, which is significantly greater depreciation than the average in\u00a0CarGurus\u2019 used-vehicle index.  At the center of the free fall is the Tesla Cybertruck, which has fallen a massive -58 percent year over year. Admittedly, a good bit of this value drop-off is due to the truck\u2019s demand falling off a cliff in recent months, coupled with 2024\u2019s significant reseller market temporarily driving up prices. But it\u2019s not\u00a0just the Cybertruck. The 3, Y, S, and X all have significant drops since last year, ranging from -6.3 percent to -13.6 percent. The 90-day trend shows a similar downward drift. CNN noted another warning sign: Despite the record-low prices for a Tesla on the used market and a prominent advertisement by the president of the United States, the cars have been having a tough time finding buyers, according to a March survey from Cars.com. Searches for used Teslas decreased 16 percent over the past month, while demand for used non-Tesla electric vehicles has increased 28 percent over the past year. . BYD, a Chinese automaker and one of Tesla\u2019s top competitors, is taking in record sums of money as its own sales flounder. CNN reports: On Monday, BYD reported $107 billion in revenue for 2024 \u2014 crossing the $100 billion level for the first time and besting Tesla\u2019s annual revenue by about $10 billion. That milestone came a week after BYD\u00a0unveiled\u00a0a charging system that it says will give its latest EV model 250 miles of range after plugging in for just five minutes. BYD\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares are already up more than 50% this year. This post has been updated throughout. A section has been deleted which summarized an erroneous Financial Times article which reported that Tesla\u2019s financial statements were missing $1.4 billion in assets; FT has now retracted the report.

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"In his keynote address yesterday at the Tesla meeting, Elon Musk implored his employees to hang on to their TSLA stocks. What he didn't tell them was Tesla insiders have been dumping their stocks for months, to the tune of 745,228 shares in the last three months alone. Source: Electrek At an all-hands meeting last night, Elon Musk stood before Tesla employees and told them to \u201chang on to their TSLA stocks\u201d as Tesla board members and top executive are dumping their shares amid a 40% crash. Tesla has frequently held \u201call-hands\u201d meetings for employees over the years, but last night, it was the first time that they were streamed publicly. CEO Elon Musk didn\u2019t announce anything new during the meeting. He mostly recapped Tesla\u2019s latest milestones over the last year, thanked employees for their work, and reinstated several of his overly optimistic predictions about Tesla\u2019s future regarding self-driving cars, robots, and stock valuation. The CEO again claimed that he believed that Tesla would become the world\u2019s most valuable company by a wide margin. Musk went as far as asking employees, and indirectly the public as this was publicly live-streamed, to \u201chang on to their stocks.\u201d Electrek gives this handy chart, courtesy of SEC filings. As Chris Hayes notes, they've purchased $0 worth of $TSLA in the same period.  And the man himself, lying as always.

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":" Backyard hobbyists, travel vloggers, indie filmmakers, and even search-and-rescue teams\u2014these days, everyone wants a drone. And for good reason. A decent quadcopter can shoot stabilized 4K video from 400 feet up, map a crop field with centimeter-level accuracy, or follow a mountain biker down a trail with eerie precision. But for all the innovation in this space, there\u2019s one name stamped on nearly every controller: DJI. The Chinese giant has become the default, dominating more than 70% of the consumer drone market globally. Its products are everywhere\u2014from tech reviews to government agencies\u2014thanks to a head start in R&D, aggressive pricing, and polished design that somehow never feels cheap. But that ubiquity is now coming at a cost. The U.S. Department of Justice has already slapped tariffs on Chinese imports and is now eyeing an outright ban on market-leaders like DJI, citing concerns over data security and links to the Chinese Communist Party. Sound familiar? That\u2019s because it echoes the same playbook used against Huawei. It\u2019s a geopolitical knife fight dressed in legalese, but the ripple effects hit consumers first. With DJI\u2019s future allegedly in limbo stateside, the timing couldn\u2019t be better for rivals to step up. A few already have\u2014offering sleek airframes, competitive sensors, and AI-powered autonomy that could give even a Mavic a midair identity crisis. Here are 5 alternative drone companies if you\u2019re looking to take to the skies without worrying about which company the US government will crack down on next.       Autel Robotics has quietly carved out its own lane in the drone world, often flying under the radar but steadily winning over professionals and hobbyists who value performance without compromise. Based in the U.S. with manufacturing in China, Autel walks a careful geopolitical tightrope, but its hardware speaks louder than any press release. The company made a splash with its EVO series, building a reputation for rugged designs, high-end specs, and fewer restrictions compared to DJI\u2019s more tightly controlled ecosystems. Autel drones often ship with fewer no-fly zone limitations, swappable batteries, and a more open-ended user experience, which has won them a loyal following among professionals and independent creators alike, as well as notable design awards like the Red Dot Award. The EVO Lite+ and EVO II series are the standout offerings for camera-focused users. The EVO Lite+ comes equipped with a 1-inch CMOS sensor that shoots 5K video at 30fps and 20MP stills, matching the Mavic Air 2S spec-for-spec while offering better low-light performance thanks to an adjustable aperture ranging from f\/2.8 to f\/11. It clocks in around $899 on Amazon, undercutting some DJI models while still offering 40 minutes of flight time per charge. For creators needing more horsepower, the EVO II Pro 6K and 8K variants are where things get serious. The 8K model boasts a 1\/2-inch CMOS sensor for ultra-high-res video, while the EVO II Pro steps up to a 1-inch sensor with 10-bit color and HDR support. With up to 40 minutes of flight time, omnidirectional obstacle avoidance, and a top speed of 45mph, the EVO II Pro punches directly in the same weight class as the Mavic 3 series\u2014and it holds its own.  HOVERAir isn\u2019t trying to play the same game as the legacy drone makers. Instead of chasing altitude or brute specs, the brand has doubled down on portability, automation, and being a hands-free hovering camera. Developed by Zero Zero Robotics, HOVERAir\u2019s roots go back to 2016, when the original Hover Camera Passport made waves with its book-sized footprint and fold-out carbon fiber cage. Fast forward to today, and HOVERAir\u2019s lineup feels like a deliberate counter to the controller-heavy, app-driven drone world. Designed to be foldable so the drones can flip shut like a book and fit in your pocket; they\u2019re made for creators who want to toss a drone into the air and have it just work\u2014no setup, no sticks, no fiddling with ISO. The HOVERAir X1 PRO takes that philosophy and runs with it. Weighing just 191.5 grams, it dodges FAA registration entirely and still manages to shoot stabilized 8K@30fps video using a 2-axis gimbal system powered by software-based image stabilization. With pre-programmed flight modes like \u201cOrbit,\u201d \u201cFollow,\u201d and \u201cBird\u2019s Eye,\u201d it leans heavily into AI, using subject tracking and gesture controls to anticipate user intent. Battery life hovers around 16 minutes, but charging is fast, and spare batteries are lightweight enough to carry in multiples. The PROMAX variant adds improved subject tracking and an upgraded camera system with better low-light performance and faster frame rates. Pricing sits around $499 for the X1 PRO and edges closer to $699 for the PROMAX, making them ideal for travel content creators, social media filmmakers, or anyone who wants cinematic drone footage without learning to be a pilot.       V-Coptr is a name that sounds like it was ripped from a forgotten Sega Genesis title, but the engineering behind it is far from retro. Developed by Zero Zero Robotics\u2014the same folks behind the HoverAir X1 PRO and PROMAX\u2014V-Coptr takes an unconventional approach to drone design. Instead of the familiar quadcopter layout, it opts for a bicopter V-wing configuration, which looks more like a mini stealth aircraft than a consumer drone. This zany design drastically reduces energy consumption during hover and forward flight, giving it one major advantage over traditional four-rotor setups: endurance. The Falcon Mini, V-Coptr\u2019s latest consumer offering, pushes this advantage further. Clocking in at just 249 grams, it skirts under most drone registration limits while still offering a stabilized 4K camera thanks to a 3-axis mechanical gimbal. The unique dual-rotor design contributes to a 34-minute maximum flight time\u2014more than what most tiny quadcopters can manage in real-world conditions, while still being fairly quiet thanks to having half as many rotors. While exact pricing hasn\u2019t been announced, the Falcon Mini competes directly with DJI\u2019s Mini 3 lineup. But the V-tail silhouette isn\u2019t the only thing that makes it stand out\u2014its power efficiency and compact form give it real-world usability that goes beyond the spec sheet.  Potensic isn\u2019t a name that usually headlines drone expos or gets front-page love in tech media, but that\u2019s part of its charm. It\u2019s the kind of brand you stumble onto while scrolling through mid-range drones and suddenly realize\u2014wait, this thing checks a lot of boxes. Based in China, Potensic has been building a reputation in the budget-to-mid-tier space by focusing on functional design, accessible pricing, and solid user experience. While many of its earlier offerings skewed toward beginner drones with lightweight specs, the company\u2019s more recent push into serious consumer hardware shows it\u2019s ready to challenge the segment dominated by names with bigger marketing budgets. The ATOM 2 is Potensic\u2019s sleeper hit, especially for budget-conscious creators who still care about camera quality and flight precision. At just 249 grams, it skims under the FAA\u2019s registration limit in the U.S. but still packs a 4K camera with a 3-axis gimbal\u2014features that used to be reserved for drones costing twice as much. It offers 31 minutes of flight time per battery, a respectable 10 km transmission range, and advanced subject tracking powered by Potensic\u2019s algorithm. Video maxes out at 4K\/30fps (and photos at 8K) with surprisingly crisp color reproduction and decent low-light handling for its size. What makes the ATOM 2 even more impressive is its foldable design and sub-$400 price tag, which positions it as one of the most capable ultralight drones in its class. It\u2019s the kind of gear that punches above its weight, especially for solo travelers, new pilots, or anyone who wants stabilized aerial footage without clearing out their savings account.  Skydio stands out by doing what almost no other drone company dares: betting the house on AI. Based in California and staffed by veterans from MIT and Google Project Wing, Skydio doesn\u2019t try to out-spec DJI in raw camera performance. Instead, it leans hard into autonomy\u2014building drones that think for themselves, navigate with uncanny awareness, and follow subjects with a level of confidence that feels borderline science fiction. While their marketing sometimes gestures toward consumer use, Skydio\u2019s DNA is undeniably enterprise-grade. Whether it\u2019s bridge inspections, military scouting, or police reconnaissance, these drones are engineered for mission-critical tasks where GPS isn\u2019t enough and pilot error isn\u2019t an option. The Skydio 2+ might look like a compact, GoPro-sized quadcopter, but it\u2019s hiding a staggering amount of tech under its matte blue frame. It uses six 4K navigation cameras to build a real-time 3D map of its surroundings, letting it dodge trees, wires, and sudden obstacles at full speed\u2014autonomously. The main camera captures 4K60 HDR video with an f\/2.8 lens and a Sony 1\/2.3\u2033 CMOS sensor, which isn\u2019t mind-blowing on paper, but Skydio\u2019s real magic lies in how effortlessly it can track a subject through a dense forest or urban maze. Flight time hovers around 27 minutes, and the max range extends to 6 km with the upgraded Beacon or controller. While the Skydio 2+ starts at $1,099, it\u2019s best experienced with the accessories that push it into $1,500\u2013$2,000 territory. This series doesn\u2019t chase cinematic aesthetics\u2014it chases reliability, precision, and trust in AI. It\u2019s the Phantom\u2019s spiritual successor for pilots who don\u2019t want to micromanage every joystick twitch. I\u2019ve always been a fan of tech that blends seamlessly into everyday use.

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"The idea for this quilt came to me several years ago. Besides making quilts, I make some of my own clothes and occasionally make clothes for people in my life. I made my own wedding dress and one for a college friend as well (and never doing that again). There\u2019s something special nowadays about something that was made or tailored just for you, whether it was done by a friend\/family member or something you had made. When I was a kid, my father gave my mother a birthday gift of what was essentially a copy of her favorite dress, made by a local seamstress. The style was pretty basic, but not being sold in stores at that time. I\u2019m sure it was quite expensive. It was very thoughtful, she loved and wore the dress for ages, until her cancer surgeries made its fit uncomfortable. But while I love the personal connections of bespoke\/self-made clothing, I want to push back a bit against some language that occurs when people (myself included) talk about store-bought clothing, especially cheaper clothing. Whether it\u2019s the nice Lands End flannel shirt I\u2019m wearing as I write this, or the one my husband is wearing that I made for him, or the TikTok influencer\u2019s Shein t-shirt that rips when she tries it on\u2026 all clothing is handmade. I made this quilt using worn textiles from friends, family, and some folks in my church and scraps from my own projects. It\u2019s got a piece of fabric from my wedding dress and others from one of my mom\u2019s favorite dresses. There\u2019s a couple of my husband\u2019s old dress shirts, bits of my father\u2019s ties, the lining of my little sister\u2019s worn jacket, highlights from a friend\u2019s tunic, bits of baby dresses, another friend\u2019s dress shirt, and more. There\u2019s a couple little pieces of leftover fabric from that same flannel shirt my husband is wearing right now. I pieced it ages ago, I can\u2019t quite even remember\u2026 2020? It\u2019s a wonky quilt, dozens of fabrics that were never meant to sit side-by-side. A little leather just for fun and frustration. It took forever to figure out how I wanted to quilt it (large stitches with long strokes, colors matching as best I could in the blocks themselves) and then to get to it, but I\u2019m very glad that it\u2019s done and I can share it now. 21st century textile production happens on a massive scale, one that keeps ramping up and has enormous environmental costs. The quality of mass-market textiles has dropped noticeably since the 1990s, which were also a noticeable drop from the 1970s. When people talk about this change in quality, the language often carries a set of assumptions. These assumptions are often both geographically and racially coded. \u201cThis t-shirt was made in Honduras\u201d or \u201cThis blouse was made in Cambodia\u201d imply things about their quality and often subtly, sometimes not-so-subtly, attached to the people actually doing the work. But even if one assessed ten thousand blouses made in Cambodia for their quality, any negative findings say nothing about the talents or potential of Cambodian garment workers as a whole or relate to, say, American garment workers. What they reflect instead are: These decisions are all made by the company that ordered the clothing and, quite possibly, also by one or more subcontractors. While brands may plead innocence and outsourcing, the cost per item they demand from their suppliers directly influences this\u2026and they know it. Mass-produced clothing is low quality when someone overseeing the project decided to make it low quality. Mass-produced clothing is high quality when someone overseeing the project decided to make it high quality. What country it came from and who made it is a reflection of how the company wanted to pay and treat the people making it, not of those people\u2019s skills or potential. How does the way we speak of textile manufacturing (especially that done in East Asia) create and reinforce perceptions of East Asian women\u2019s (primarily in our perception) capacity to do high-quality sewing? Why do we let it reflect on them instead of on the companies which made the choice? What can we change about our how we think and talk to change that stereotype? While some clothing is bespoke, all clothing is handmade. In thinking about this, I was inspired by many of the books I\u2019ve read but also by Janneken Smucker\u2019s Amish Quilts. In particular, she delves into perceptions of Hmong women in Lancaster County and, later on, in refugee camps in Thailand, who sew \u201cAmish\u201d quilts. Is there something about an Amish woman that actually makes her a better seamstress or is that our racial perceptions? (yes) Also check out the documentary Invisible Seams by Jia Li and Jodie Chan, which interviews eight Asian seamstresses and pattern-makers in the New York garment industry. I only came across this a week ago, just before finishing the quilt, but it spoke to another element of the same thing. Check out this interview with Jia and Jodie where they go into more depth about the project and what they didn\u2019t have space to cover.      \u00a9 2011 - 2025 \u00b7       Powered by the Academic theme for Hugo.

Still germane.] AOC and Bernie are out on a talking tour across the country right now, trying to unify the Dems.  smh.  Good luck with that. Bernie\u2019s schtick was medicare for all but then endorsed Biden who promised to veto M4A if it ever came across his desk as President. He then abandoned M4A in April of 2020 just as the Pandemic was taking off in America. These days he is all in on fighting Russia and shutting down criticisms of Israel\u2019s genocide. Bernie is not the progressive that you are looking for \u2013 and maybe he never was. I don\u2019t think bernie was ever progressive.  Maybe back in the 60\u2019s, or  in the dark reaches of his mind.  Back when he was a local vermont politician, he had the ability to CLAIM to be on the right side of history\u2026. he would have known there was no downside to CLAIMING to be progressive in the tiny ecosystem that is vermont politics\u2026. He would never have to walk the walk\u2026 and could just talk the talk\u2026.Since he was never in charge of anything more than what a mayor can do\u2026 which doesn\u2019t extend very far.  And his career in the senate has been nothing but , talking the talk, and being prevented from walking the walk. He has a specific eco-system in vermont. No actual power, so he doesn\u2019t have to accept the charge he has never DONE anything\u2026. as his supporters in vermont are not very aware of the smallness of their eco system.  The decades he has been a placeholder for the establishment\u2026. prove he is all hat and no cattle , as they say. I am even of the opinion of his campaign for medicare for all\u2026showed his scam.. he should have really been for universal healthcare.  Not a system where there are different plans, different costs and coverages. Details that are to be exploited were anything to come of it. By those who always do.  And now\u2026  His true colors\u2026  More war..  More zionist crimes against humanity  More money\u2026.  Someone should tell that old schmuck, to just retire already. I\u2019m a one time Bernie-bro. I agree with everything you say here. I once was proud of myself because I had never bought into Obama\u2019s Kumbaya presentation. I could see it for what it was, a sales job. I voted for him over McCain because I thought he was calm, not hot-headed, period. I nailed it. Then Bernie came along and I went all in on his whole schtick, all because he advocated for Medicare for all. I thought, \u201cFinally, here\u2019s one who\u2019s truly progressive, for the people.\u201dI\u2019ve come to realize it WAS just a schtick, for the time. He got me. I can no longer brag about seeing through Obama\u2019s BS, because I was completely taken in at the next carnival stand. I forgot, because I don\u2019t pay attention to AOC because she\u2019s crap, but she was busy nuking Stein and the Green Party from orbit and supporting genocide just this past cycle. What a horrible person AOC is. I heard parts of both their speeches, and I didn\u2019t hear anything about uniting the democrats. On the contrary, sanders didn\u2019t have much to say about that party, instead stating that all like-minded people, such as those in the crowd, have to (organize now) come together to defeat trumpism and try to create a better world for themselves and their neighbors. His emphasis on collective action, as opposed to trump saying that he (trump) alone can solve the nation\u2019s problems, is a constant in every speech I\u2019ve heard sanders give. Whether or not you believe him to be acting as a sheepdog, at least throw him an honest bone, and don\u2019t misrepresent what the man is saying. um\u2026 \u2018coming together to defeat Trumpism\u2019 means voting Dem, does it not? adding: I was a Yuuge Bernie supporter in 2016 and 2020.  Watching him fold \u2013 twice \u2013 to the Dem machine machinations was both disillusioning and enlightening. I still remember the Dem estab saying the estab chose the candidate.  What the Dem voters did in primaries didn\u2019t matter because the Dem party was a private party run by the estab. Does it? Absolutely. Flora is right. The Democrats actually went to court a coupla years ago where they won their argument saying that was how their party was set up. The bulk majority of Democrat members have got no say in how the party is run. Yep. DNC to Court: We Are a Private Corporation With No Obligation to Follow Our Rules https:\/\/ivn.us\/posts\/dnc-to-court-we-are-a-private-corporation-with-no-obligation-to-follow-our-rules Perhaps, just perhaps, \u2018coming together to defeat Trumpism\u2019 means this? Good morning, and thank you for this article, mrsyk. While I commend bernie for being on the right side while in college, in the 1960\u2019s\u2026. I have to think that was a time when standing firm for civil rights was all the rage.  I also am not even guessing he really didn\u2019t have civil rights as 100% of his motivations; at the time.  But I know plenty of people who were idealistic in their youth. Then they choose their own decisions in every era of their lives. The phrase, \u201cwhat have you done for me ,lately?\u201d really is what counts in the real world.  Just because someone once upon a time had a better idea, doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t spend their life   going down the wrong road.  Look at milton friedman being one of the economists who supported the chicago plan in the thirties\u2026. then to go on with his working life to usher in neoliberalism.   And bernie\u2019s clinging to the democratic foreign policy , is enough to damn him forever. Even if it is just his actions of the last two years.  Once you are in for genocide\u2026 you\u2019re done. yeah i was boutta post something similar to rob about how activists might have noble intentions and care deeply about the cause. or they might just be fighitng for whatever\u2019s in front of them. like any group you\u2019re involved in, it can be a way to make friends and gain influence as much as a cause. i see this so often on my college campus. maybe sanders was quiet on his activism not out of humbleness, but because he wanted to keep it quiet for political reasons. i think activism is largely good. right. even if it fails it can help build community structures. which is good. but man. a lot of \u201cactivists\u201d are just super annoying people with rampant infighting and power struggles who just wanna feel like theyre the underdog. Yeah well the same could have been said of Benito Mussolini: began his political career as a committed socialist abandoned socialism, founding the fascist movement in 1919. He embraced ultranationalism, authoritarianism, and anti-communism, Or Whittaker Chambers     a dedicated communist in the 1920s and 1930s, working as a spy for the Soviet Union in the U.S. government.Later became a prominent anti-communist, testifying against Alger Hiss in the 1948 espionage case Or Eldridge Cleaver\u2026 You get my point. thanks! Were I correspondent on the US for a paper I\u00b4d be having a field day with this stuff. Forget the Democratic Party. I think that we are living in revolutionary times. There is nothing certain of what might happen if the establishment (a good term to define the power block controlling american life) feels threatened. Trump seems to think that he\u2019s the son of god, but he\u2019s not. I can\u2019t think of Jesus going after grandma\u2019s pension, her social security, but I can think of trump, musk, lutnik, et.al., going after them like the greedy, elitist miscreants they are. The same goes for medicare, education, agricultural assistance, the whole kit and kaboddle that the billionaires want. The crowds that are coming out to hear sanders are giving the Establishment something to think about, or in trump\u2019s case, something to post about. Right now, by appearing in public, a public energized by the moment, there\u2019s no saying what could happen. That goes double if there\u2019s a tesla dealership in the area. I\u2019m certain that trump\u2019s vanity has been wounded by the spectacle occurring around sanders, and he doesn\u2019t like it. His response will be interesting, if he\u2019s not being too busy daydreaming about destroying Iran. And, oh, if you think americans can hardly wait to send their sons to go and die for the Jews (and they will call them, the Jews, not zionists) you\u2019d be in error. Oh wait, trump can get around that particular problem, by nuking Iran, or some section of it, and keeping his financial stream intact. Goody, goody, for trump. All I\u2019m suggesting is that no one can know what might happen in the near future. Maybe sanders will stumble into a revolution, but probably not. Maybe nothing will come from his rallies. But maybe he will inadvertently push the needle forward. I do think that this is a revolutionary moment, and a great unknown is now upon us. Power still belongs to the people, and they still retain the power to change history. Bernie had that all in his hands after the 2016 primary.  That was his moment to propel a new wing of the Dem party.  Many of us were expecting he would pick up and run with that. And\u2026 he let it drop.  Instead of using the electoral voting base force he\u2019d generated and using it for non-establishment candidates in states and even for state elections, he let it drop. So there\u2019s that. Agreed, and here we are. I think that in 2016 sanders was loathe to split the democratic party and open the door for trump. He might have had the sense, after campaigning himself, that h. clinton stood a good chance of losing, but as Yves has reminded us, sanders, being an independent, and being allowed to run as a democrat, had promised to support the winning candidate. And sanders had always said, in campaign speech after speech, that he couldn\u2019t do it himself, but that it would take \u2018the people\u2019 to ultimately change the system. And I think there\u2019s a lot of truth in that. And so here we are in 2025. Sanders was politically whacked by the dem establishment in 2020, the democrat biden was a disaster, a genocidal and ruthless politician who never spent a day in office without thinking, Now what can I do today to help Joe Biden, and the monstrous and pathological trump is ruling like a mob boss. So what is to be done? Voting got us into this hole, and voting will only keep us in this hole, but only sinking deeper and deeper. I suggest a course shift, a revolution, if you may. Daily life is threatened for many by chaos and want, so that life is growing unbearably hard and miserable. The liberty that we have is a sham, and can be ignored at will by our nation\u2019s leaders; e.g., brave men and women who have stood up to peacefully protest the Gazan genocide are now being swept up and removed from their homes and families. Happiness, then has grown more ephemeral for most americans, and a greedy and morose spirit has replaced it. There, life, liberty, and happiness. Recall when you first heard those words, and how hollow they sound now. The Democratic Party? The Republican Party? There is a better way. And yet, by not splitting the Dem party and demanding a rethink of the Dem party elite\u2019s basic domestic goals he did open the door to T, imo. Efforts to start a better realer party would have to be forced over, under and through the 2-Party Conspiracy to prevent such a better party arising.   But people could still try, if they had the patience.   Such a party could call itself the New Deal Party.   It could call what we have been living through the Reagan Revolution in honor of its first founder.    It could call it the Reagan Revolution and Beyond.    It could flip the script on \u201crevolution\u201d and call itself the Party of Counter Revolution.    It could state one of its aims as being to tear out the Upper Class Revolution and burn it all the way down to its Reagan roots.    \u201d Back to the Future\u201d    \u201cWe are the Counter Revolution\u201d   Who\u2019s the contra now, eh? I agree that Flora is right about what the Dems did in court.  However, that does not answer the question that Erstwhile asked at 9:42, which I think is directed at Flora\u2019s statement, \u201ccoming together to defeat Trumpism\u2019 means voting Dem, does it not?\u201d The estab didn\u2019t even offer a primary last year and foisted Kamala on the voters; And were then angry at the voters they\u2019d disenfranchised from a primary vote for not voting for the estab\u2019s chosen nominee.  Nice\u2026. The party estab machined Bernie out of the 2016 and 2020 race and then refused to even hold a proforma primary last year.  That\u2019s 3 pres election cycles in a row where the Dem estab didn\u2019t care a bit about their base voters preferences.  That\u2019s 3 pres cycles of being told \u2018you don\u2019t matter, little voter.\u2019 I think most of us here are clear about democrat perfidy, but that still doesn\u2019t negate what Erstwhile wrote above. The question is how, exactly to address the problem.   By third party vote?  Maybe.  I\u2019m pretty sure Bernie and AOC would be aghast at the thought. By voting in the Dem primaries for better Dems? Maybe, (but after the last 8+ years, I\u2019m not so sure that\u2019s a realistic working answer). By voting out the T admin by voting in another Dem estab admin?  The same Dem estab that\u2019s been trying to cut or privatize SS and Medicare since the C admin?  The same Dem admin that greenlights what\u2019s happening in Isr, except asking it to proceed more slowly to create better optics? The same Dem party estab that gleefully mocked its working class voting base with woke bs? If I sound just a tiny bit p.o.\u2019d with the Dem estab its because I supported them for decades and received nothing in return, well, except for the \u201cfighting for you\u201d kabuki theater. It\u2019s called the uniparty for a reason. By voting in the Dem primaries for better Dems? Judging by the reaction of establishment dems to the self financed candidate in i think mississippi telling him he didn\u2019t go through the right channels I\u2019d say the dems are making sure no one unacceptable to them will be allowed in a primary\u2026.if they even deign to have one. The dem establishment simply view themselves as the good republicans, so uniparty it is\u2026I am not sanguine. The dems did this to themselves. Controlled flight into terrain\u2026and yes, aoc and bernie are stumping for the dems as the lesser of two evils, but it\u2019s a hard sell for them as it is no longer obvious that they are in fact lesser\u2026.authoritarian surveillance capitalism and privatizing the commons are right in the dems wheelhouse and they are swinging for the fences (and with a whiffle ball and plastic bat if they choose kamala again. Bernie and aoc\u2019s pitches are full of holes.) I predict that Democrats will win in 2028 as a reaction to Trump, and then fail to roll back much of what Trump has destroyed. As usual, they will do the absolute minimum (or less) while telling voters they did a lot. The Dems remain the pawl in the Uniparty ratchet ensuring that all policy only ever shifts rightwards at the expense of American working people I agree with you, flora, and I understand why you are angry with the dems.  I don\u2019t have any answers to your questions mainly because I don\u2019t think we are going to be able to vote our way out of this situation. The only one making sense today is Chris Hedges. If we don\u2019t \u201chit the streets\u201d everything will continue as is. And the odds of enough people hitting streets are, as a friend of mine used to say, \u201csomewhere between Slim and None, and the last I knew Slim was somewhere south of Texas.\u201d Defeating \u2018Trumpism\u2019 may or may not mean voting for Democrats . . . or voting for some and against others, etc.    It can also mean upgrading the daily-behavior culture of millions and then tens of millions of people to base their daily lives on conducting a slow grinding semicott against those businesses and sectors most pro-Republican and also pro-Trumpist.    Making \u201d pro-Trumpism\u201d not pay anymore.    If enough people can exterminate Tesla from existence and wipe it off the face of the earth, then Trumpism may turn out not to pay for Mr. Musk, for example.   It would take steady economic undermining-type behavior by tens of millions of people for years.    It would take a massive high-population culture-change. Good luck, yes. But sooner or later it\u00b4s gonna be AOC if nothing out of the ordinary happens. (Admittedly no clue how she performs on stage) But those teens who will be voting in a few years all will be \u201cGen AOC\u201d. \u201cMark my words, mark them well\u201d (this \u201cthe Merovingian\u201d speaking) AOC is good when she\u2019s on script. When she\u2019s not on script it\u2019s a disaster. She\u2019s currently being encouraged to primary Schumer next year.  I bet she won\u2019t. Sorry but Chuck isn\u2019t up for reelection until 2028. A lot can change in that time, she might really have a statewide constituency then, she doesn\u2019t now. I don\u2019t know who they\u2019ll get, but the bench in NY is even shallower than the national one. As disappointing as both AOC and Fetterman have been, I still hope someone outside the mainstream of the state party enters and takes it. Hell I pretty much hope that for every election going forward, not just Chuck\u2019s in 2028. Thanks. Say, did you hear that Fetterman went to Israel a coupla days ago and Netanyahu gifted him a silver-plated pager? Pity it wasn\u2019t a working model but I would be checking it for bugs anyway. Nah, but I  can believe it. Fetterman has never lived up to his team\u2019s brilliant social media campaign. I don\u2019t know if I hope to live long enough to see it (it is horrific), but I do believe that sometime in the future something similar patterned on that pager\/cell phone trick will happen to important Americans and Israelis. Probably every country will be attacked that way. It is diabolical. So the Dems seem to have a thing for pretty women who can\u00b4t do impro? May be Schumer should put on a wig, put on some lipstick and run for office. His chances might turn out to be better than we think\u2026 AOC and Buttigieg are the same generation, both millennials. AOC is grassroots and firebrand, Buttigieg seems to be the more polished speaker and particularly good at off-script which probably comes from having his head firmly grounded in policy understanding, whereas AOC seems to think an angry speech here and there conjures all the magics needed.  AOC wants to be anti-institutional, anti-establishment, Buttigieg is a Biden in spirit, much institutional, much establishment.   I\u2019m not American and don\u2019t pretend to understand, but assuming logic, which is probably the wrong assumption, to my mind Americans will vote for Buttigieg if Trump keeps up his hijinx of destroying government and institutions.  With the country and economy in ruins they will not want to hear AOC\u2019s anti-establishment scripts, will want a return to normalcy, will want a Biden but without the advanced years.   So it seems to me in order for AOC to win she needs a different approach, needs a rewrite, whereas Buttigieg only needs to keep doing what he\u2019s doing, there will always be appetite for a calming, stabilizing Buttigieg-type-person in between the periods of chaotic upheaval. wait this is true. we\u2019re only a little bit into the trump admin so i havent fully adjusted to what the political climate will be like come 2028. you\u2019re right that after a bunch of trump upheaval a stability candidate might fly. it really depends on how the trump admin is doing come 2028. i really feel like AOC will not fly no matter what. she has a lot of the same issues as harris. Re: flora at 10:04 am > AOC is good when she\u2019s on script. > When she\u2019s not on script it\u2019s a disaster. There\u2019s no politically correct way to say this so I\u2019ll be blunt \u2014 and I can\u2019t imagine that I\u2019m the only one who thinks this. No matter what AOC says, it\u2019s the way she says it that drives me mad. She is always so familyblogging shrill! Ms. Harris\u2019 singular ability is to get people to care about her political success. She might actually be the best option for the next cycle. In which case, the Dems are doomed. We will be subjected to awful media attempts over the next four years as the junkies keep trying again for that sweet 2018 high. Speaking of 2018, what\u2019s Neera Tanden up to these days? \/ ;) Polls done before campaigns have started are pretty meaningless.  I remember sometime not long after 2000, Droopy Dawg Joe Lieberman was also polling as a heavy favorite to be the Dem nominee in 2004  Alas, the Joementum didn\u2019t last. Ahhh, I was in the mood for inflicting pain on myself, so I had to read that \u201cKamala Harris emerges as clear frontrunner for 2028 Democratic Party nomination\u201d story too, just for the utter ridiculousness of the concept. It\u2019s obviously nonsensical to be polling about 2028 at this point. Plenty of right-wing sites are also in on the nonsense, talking up a third term for Trump already. But, at any rate, the linked article offers up such a parade of losers, it reinforces the feeling that the Democratic party should just shut down: Harris, Buttegieg, Newsom, Walz, Josh Shapiro, AOC, Pritzker, Whitmer, Mark Cuban (!?!)\u2026none of these people should be allowed anywhere near the 2028 nomination. And what kind of platform would they run on? A \u201ckinder, gentler Republican\u201d again, like before they got all woke? Don\u2019t any of the larger unions have leaders that could stand for the nomination? Look for the union label, I would say, if you (the Democrats) are going to even bother with 2028. Ah, the Cheshire Panda! Grin and bear it? (Naturally, it being from China, it is a Red.) Oh frabjous day! We have lost the Mandate of Heaven. NC keeps on coming up with animals that I have never heard of before but are adorable nonetheless- https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Red_panda Also known as the Lesser Panda. https:\/\/ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com\/wiki\/Lesser_Panda Too soon. \u201cKamala Harris, 60, received 36% support among Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters, giving her a significant double-digit advantage over her closest competitor, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who secured 10%.\u201d From the article at Live Mint, \u201cKamala Harris emerges as clear frontrunner [in promoting any proxy war that gets her attention.\u201d I read it so that you don\u2019t have to. At this moment in spacetime, speculation about anything the Dems plan to do is pura fuffa.  I would like some general opinions, it being Sunday, when the groundlings here have a moment to make coffee and contemplate the sorry state of the Anglosphere. About: The Bernie and AOC tour Against Oligarchy. My strongest impression in the last few days is that it is much ado about nothing. Something like that one-day boycott of major platforms on 28 February. Remember that revolution? Bernie is good a lecturing, but he hasn\u2019t been effective at, errr, winning the nomination to the presidency. He was a loyal soldier to Biden, going into full \u201cPutin under the Bed\u201d mode and expressing some minimal doubts about the seemliness of the slaughter in Palestine. Certainly, he and AOC haven\u2019t quite clarified their opposition of the proxy wars \/ genocides in Palestine-Israel and Ukraine-Russia \u2014 and they are now in the liberal dilemma of being against negotiations and an armistice because Trump and Vance are for them. The wars did in Kamala Harris. I recall her braying, \u201cI\u2019m Speaking\u201d to a group of pro-Palestinian demonstrators, including people whose family members had been slaughtered in the West Bank and Gaza. When the wars come home, the wars come home. So is Bernie a spent force, stumbling from one concealed defeat to the next? Is AOC mainly a huckster, trying to get out in front of the aspirations of potential Dem voters? PS: Isn\u2019t this the same AOC who had it in for Jill Stein and the Greens in the fall of 2024? Well, at least, she didn\u2019t go Full Hillary and call Jill Stein a Russian agent.  PPS: Isn\u2019t Elizabeth Warren still all worried that Bernie Sanders is a sexist? Dunno whether Bernie is a tragic figure or a concealed villain, but while he\u2019s speaking the truth, the question is \u201cTo what end?\u201d To put the silent establishment Dems back in the game or to create a truly progressive alternative? I somehow doubt it\u2019s the latter, given that he\u2019s only diagnosing the problem without endorsing a political alternative. I also doubt that the majority in those crowds think in any other terms than the political duopoly or in terms of taking over the Dem Party the way MAGA took over the Republican Party. Given that, the end result will likely be to safely sheepdog the disgruntled voters back into the Dem fold, where the neoliberal centrism is being given a cosmetic face-lift under the new Abundance brand.  What a depressing thought. Sadly, I think Bernie is yet another elderly politician suffering cognitive impairment. In his prime he was great. Now, he is relying on guff like friendship with former presidents\/senators.  I think he gets more of a free pass because his repeated \u201crallying cries\u201d resonate. However when it comes to ACTION he doesn\u2019t deliver. Though I value what he espoused, I  would no more want him in power than Trump\/Biden etc. OIFVet: I think that you have hit the mark. It isn\u2019t depressing. It is being a realist. Oddly, this dog-and-pony-and-hopey show doesn\u2019t pass the smell test in Italian politics. Italian politics look unusually straightforward and even focused on results compared to Bernie\u2019s Kumbayaganza. (An Italian journalist, Michele Serra, just organized an EUKumbayaganza demo in Roma that is getting withering criticism.) And you have to admit, the sheer idea that Rahm is considering a run for president means that we both are considerably better off out of Chicago, eh. Rahmbo Emanuel, who called progressives pressuring Obama for single payer \u201cEffing retarded\u201d? That tried to bust up the CTU? That Rahmbo?  Yeah, he will bring the working class back into the Democrat plantation, no doubt \ud83d\ude44 Sadly, amongst the BG equivalent of the bicoastal liberal elites, that type of dog and pony show sells like $10 donuts. I\u2019m saying that, because they actually take pride in being able to pay $10 for a single donut with passion fruit filling, while demonstrating contempt for the peasants in flyover Bulgaria who inexplicably refuse to vote for their party. The funny thing is, today there\u2019s lots of buzz amongst them about the civic organization I am part off, because they are deluded enough to think they can use us to penetrate into the province. We won\u2019t gonna allow them to use us in any way, but it goes to show that it\u2019s all about the electoral with them, not about substance and societal needs. Frankly, that model needs to be killed with fire. \u201cRahmbo Emanuel\u201d \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Rahm! Rahm! He\u2019s the BOMB!!! Sweet Elissa! Our CIA Sistah! Pete!  Pete! Kept the airports neat! Talk about a deep bench! As someone who considers the fact that Emmanuel, along with the chief of police, is not currently in prison for multiple counts of kidnapping and wrongful imprisonment to be one of the abominations of our system and one of the largest atrocities of the last couple of decades that disgusts me. It is even worse than our granny killing criminal of a former governor being the front runner to be the mayor of NYC.  With shining lights such as these, along with Obama, Biden and Clinton, is it any wonder the Democratic Party is stinking cesspool incapable of even pretending to be representative of any decent human any more. If it barks like a sheep dog? We had this debate here back when Bernie was a lot more relevant. Personally I think he was always sincere while at the same time being very much part of the DC political establishment. To think outside the box you have to be outside the box and he wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s the Dem party that must go first, then Bernie\u2019s \u201cbillionaires.\u201d Institutions decay. I also think Bernie was sincere in 2016 and maybe in early 2020.  I tell myself that he thought (as if I know what anyone else thinks) that if he could demonstrate huge crowds approving of his message then that would move the Dem estab toward his policy prescriptions.  Of course, it did not.   He is now a spent force.  Most of us know the Dem party estab is indebted to its own oligarchs \u2014 Bernie and AOCs current speechs notwithstanding. There are those who call Bernie and AOC \u201dsheepdogs\u2019, whose purpose it is to shepard radicals into the Dem tent. For my part, I think AOC is an opportunist \u2013 a commenter here, I think it was Wukchumi, called her \u201cAntionette Of Color\u201d. The rumor in parts of The Left in America has it that Bernie abandoned his true populist crusade as a consequence of federal prosecutors deciding not to pursue charges against his Catholic wife for bankrupting a college she was president of in order to funnel money to the Church, which needed it to settle lawsuits over predator priests; kompromat is, according to this theory, alive and well in America. The tour he\u2019s gracing us with is, I think, intended to lay ground for get out the vote efforts for the 2026 midterms. At the same time, he\u2019s drawing crowds, albiet not at the level he used to, which I take as a general measure of left-populism. interesting indeed\u2026everyone has those corpses somewhere You bring up Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.  I lost all respect for Mrs. Warren when she ran up to Bernie in the debate ( I think it was the debate ) and started to confront him on a hot mike about his alleged sexist remarks.  I remember being profoundly disappointed for days.  Not disappointed with him.  With her.   As in, someone capable of that kind of thing will never have my vote.  Ever.  However, the most unfortunate thing your comment brought to my mind was the Warren vs Sanders discussion during that election of 2019-2020 \u2013 when they were arguing about bringing a true single payer universal health care system to the USA.  Not so much arguing about doing it, they both seemed to be in general agreement, but how much it was going to cost and where the cost would have to come from.  As a physician, I have come to realize that this will be the only way going forward.  How quaint it was \u2013 I believe they were arguing about 18 billion vs 25 billion \u2013 or some such to get this system going.  I know they were not discussing numbers north of 50 billion.  Whatever,  the amount of money they were arguing about for that very important issue for ALL Americans literally pales in comparison to the hundreds of billions spent on Ukraine by Biden, the eventual victor.   How quaint.  How sad.  It is literally the first thing that comes to my mind the minute I hear their names. My feeling is the Dems are so tainted with this kind of thing right now and their continued behavior, that the only hope for the party is for someone to arise out of the mist, not unlike Obama. The Second Coming of Joe Lieberman? I never suspected Lieberman was a Lubavitcher. will never happen. Kill it with fire imo Long list of likely future candidates, starting with 2028.  But what will they run and what forms the organizing thoughts behind any future Presidential run\u2026.being against the current Administration isn\u2019t quite enough.  Hey let\u2019s return to those great times we shared under Joe Biden.  Okay but what if that just wasn\u2019t so great in hindsight? For the record, tone deaf antics by a sitting governor make them appear highly unserious, and perhaps serving an own goal against their brand.  Tim Walz\u2026.rooting against Musk is doable without rooting versus the interest of state run investment funds or pension funds, which own publicly traded auto manufacturers\u2026 https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/tim-walz-cheers-tesla-stock-204115455.html It seems to me the Dem party has become the war party and the spooks party.  When did liberals start loving war and the spooks? It won\u2019t matter to me  who they run until they change course in a deep way; I don\u2019t think the change can happen in 2 years. The party will need a long time in the wilderness before a change can happen, imo. The same Dem estab will still at the top until that happens.  Voting for the lesser of two evils is past its sell-by date to me. Case in point: in Germany the GREEN PARTY of all parties \u2013 which had been the Civil Rights Movement party and anti-establishment for 20 years \u2013 added a demand to the now passed war budget: They explicitely wanted more money for the secret intelligence services and the support of countries under \u201chybrid\u201d attack by foreign forces (i.e. Russia of course.) Yes I ask myself the very exact same question: \u201cWhen did liberals start loving war and the spooks?\u201d A Diana Johnstone who worked for the GREENs in Brussels for many years saw it all coming 30 years ago\u2026 The two US parties take turns doing this, it seems.  It\u2019s like alternating current.  If they keep doing\/representing the opposite of whatever the other is doing, they\u2019ll both eventually end up doing a 180 on their own principles, then round and round we go again.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if eventually we could time the cycle. you mean like this? https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2uV8g-S_Hg0 Indeed  They are lost, and so are their supporters.   20+ years ago, I was among those who hit the streets to protest against the Iraq war.  \u201cUS out of Iraq\u201d and \u201cNo blood for oil\u201d were common themes.  The lefties at the time saw through the Bush administration ruse that it was about \u201cfreedom and democracy\u201d.   Nobody was clamoring to \u201cFree Kuwait\u201d. Yesterday in my very liberal city I walked by an anti-Trump protest with maybe a couple hundred people gathered in the middle of downtown.  There were lots of anti-DOGE signs, placards calling Trump a \u2018fascist\u2019, etc.    Mixed in were quite a few signs with \u201cFree Ukraine\u201d or a Ukrainian flag.  Noticeably absent were any anti-Zionist or pro-Palestinian signs.    Evidently Michelle Obama slipping W  a little butterscotch a few years again worked like a charm in refocusing the minds of the graying puffy coat PMC crowd, which was the demographic at yesterday\u2019s protest \u2013 pro-war \u201cliberal\u201d is a thing now.  I was not in any way tempted to join the demonstration and briskly walked away, cursing under my breath.  Well, maybe not that silently. And someone somewhere is congratulating themselves on this propaganda achievement. America and the Dems have been here before, but as I get older I forget that this is not \u201cthe past we lived thru\u201d for so many Americans. LBJ decided not to run for President because of the unpopularity of the Vietnam war, and Nixon ran on ending that war: Nixon struggles to achieve \u2018peace with honor\u2019 and end unpopular Vietnam War  https:\/\/www.stripes.com\/special-reports\/vietnam-stories\/1969\/2019-08-15\/nixon-struggles-to-achieve-%E2%80%98peace-with-honor%E2%80%99-and-end-unpopular-vietnam-war-1483390.html1 That the Dems are so supportive of the Ukraine war is a mystery to me too. The idea to have Ukraine join NATO was pushed hard by W, a President whose foreign policy wars were a bit of a disaster: Bush to press for Ukraine and Georgia in NATO https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/world\/bush-to-press-for-ukraine-and-georgia-in-nato-idUSL01417062\/ But it seems every American President around that time had a hand in creating this situation: The Strategic Blunder That Led to Today\u2019s Conflict in Ukraine https:\/\/www.thenation.com\/article\/world\/nato-clinton-ukraine-russia\/ Probably because every American Presidential administration had neocons with disastrous war plans: Victoria Nuland: Farewell to the Spearhead of US Foreign Policy Disasters  https:\/\/www.stopwar.org.uk\/article\/victoria-nuland-farewell-to-the-spearhead-of-us-foreign-policy-disasters\/ We used to talk about campaign finance and the importance of getting private money out of politics. For a while Citizens United v. FEC was discussed as a serious blow to democracy (e.g Carter\u2019s \u201coligarchy with unlimited political bribery\u201d) but I don\u2019t hear those conversations so much any more. Presumably both cartel parties are satisfied with this status quo. To the very limited extent that I understand the legal theory, political speech is constitutionally unlimited and that includes spending money to speak louder and corporations are people so limiting how politicians raise money is unconstitutional. Makes no sense to me but I am not a constitutional lawyer. So presumably the party prefers the opinions in proportion to how much their holders\u2019 donate. Hence Harris and Buttigieg are front runners because they are empty vessels that will do as they are directed. On the other hand we\u2019ve seen how the class populists are handled so we won\u2019t have the option to vote for them. And then there\u2019s the two party system. As Michael Hudson put it in Oct 2020 on Macro n Cheese episode 88: Here\u2019s the problem. The reason you cannot vote your way out under the current system is that there\u2019s a two party system in the United States, and it\u2019s basically the same party with a little ethnic difference between them, but economically it\u2019s the same party and there cannot be any alternative to this monolithic \u2013 we\u2019ll call it the Republican Party with Democratic cheerleaders \u2013 there cannot be any progress made until you break up the Democratic Party. That became apparent not only when they cheated Bernie Sanders out of the nomination four years ago, but this time, when Obama came up and stacked the deck and did everything he could to organize a stab in the back against Sanders. And Bernie Sanders showed himself to be a social democrat. And he said, \u201cWell, I\u2019d rather help my own career by helping the Democratic Party. It\u2019s a gang, but I\u2019d rather be a gang member than take on the gang.\u201d And so he\u2019s dropped all of his support for public healthcare. He\u2019s dropped all the social views and he\u2019s joined the Democratic gang. What I would have liked to have seen him do, would be to say, \u201cI will not support the Democratic nominee. I realize that it is awful to have to elect a Republican again, especially a Republican like Donald Trump, but no progress can be made until we remove the current Democratic Party leadership and take it over and make it a labor party. And we cannot do that until they realize that they will lose every single election until they give up and join the rest of the Republican Party.\u201d An insurgent class-populist movement can influence and perhaps take control of the Democratic Party only if it is ready to fight the party to the point of being a spoiler. I don\u2019t think Sanders or AOC are likely to lead such an insurgency. An insurgent class-populist movement can influence and perhaps take control of the Democratic Party only if it is ready to fight the party to the point of being a spoiler. I don\u2019t think Sanders or AOC are likely to lead such an insurgency. In this regard I\u2019m at the moment particularly curious about how recently fired public sector members of the PMC will react to their current predicament. If, as some contend, the PMC has evolved into a class for itself, might they be amenable to and collectively act in service of progressive policies? Or, as some already have done, buckle under in response to extortionate demands for policy changes? As a group, many of them have useful skills necessary for the operation of a complex society. They just need to be reeducated as to what sectors of society they should be working for. For Bernie, the perfect is the enemy of the good.  Rather than encourage his followers to sit out an election and thereby hand a victory to the cultists, he sees the value of having less-than-perfect candidates at least deny office to the GOP.  He\u2019s always been practical; he has gotten more legislation passed than any other Congressperson in American history.  He subordinates his ego to what, no matter how imperfect, might improve things.  And he has the savvy not to hold his nose when he backs the people who stabbed him in the back. Harris would have won if 7,000,000 who voted for Biden had not decided she was not perfect.  Bernie\u2019s support of her almost got her across the finish line. Kamala is not perfect? I would suggest that she is America\u2019s version of Annalena Baerbock. More like Eva Peron. Eva Braun? Except that Eva Peron was loved by the people. He subordinates his ego to what, no matter how imperfect, might improve things This line of thinking is what drives corporations to do everything possible to improve stock prices in the short run even if it means sacrificing long term sustainability. Voters can see that continually voting for the better \u201cimperfect\u201d candidate has brought the country to where it is. Bernie dragging Biden across the finish line in 2020 is largely responsible for those 7 million voters staying home in 2024 Harris would have won if 7,000,000 who voted for Biden had not decided she was not perfect. Bernie\u2019s support of her almost got her across the finish line. Really? Since when is \u201cthe lesser evil\u201d the same as \u201cgood enough\u201d?  I would have settled for \u201cgood enough\u201d, most Bernie supporters would have settled for it. Except it was clear as day that she was another torchbearer for \u201clesser evilism\u201d and many had simply had it with it.  How much longer before some people stop blaming the voters for their own failures and broken promises? Rather than the lesser evil. The Dems have proven to simply be the slower evil. Perhaps the 7 million who voted for Biden who didn\u2019t vote for Kamala did that because Biden sold them out on one issue or another. And knew she was more of the same. She might have gotten more votes if she had indicated his administration was deeply flawed, change was needed, and America needed more help than Ukraine. She might have had to risk annoying AIPAC by actually condemning the ongoing devastation of Gaza and promising to actively support humanitarian aid including troops.  But one thing that absolutely needed to happen was her being honest about inflation and much of its source (domestic profiteering). The same people who had already decided not to vote for Biden again needed to know she was not going to just be his second term. She lost because she never made that case. And while Bernie is not perfect he could never have done enough to make up for that.  Democrats will always lose if they do not give a reason to vote for them not just that the other guy is X, if the other guy is actually promising the desired changes. Yay, I was waiting for the post with the blameless for the left staying home. I am sure it had nothing to do with the farsical non open process where Biden just abducated and Harris took over. Nope that wouldn\u2019t affect turnout at all! And then seeing all of the tech bros and oligarchs just toss money at her wasn\u2019t at all sickening. I wasn\u2019t going to vote for Biden because (for one thing of many things) he had lost his mind four or five years earlier and the lying Democrats and their media partners were covering it up; and I wasn\u2019t going to vote for Harris because she appeared to be very stupid and unprepared and also because she had never won any sort of primary. The Democrats rolled the dice on the durability of Biden\u2019s steadily rotting brain and lost. I blame the Democrats for putting Donald Trump in the White House. Now they just make me sick to my stomach. I see Bernie drawing crowds (assuming he is) as a way of reminding the dems what they could have had. Reminding them of the truism: Those who made Sanders impossible made Trump inevitable. I agree with this, and I don\u2019t agree that Bernie was responsible for Biden\u2019s victory. Biden won because of the Biden camp\u2019s strategy of whipping people into a frenzy of fear & hatred of Trump and his rural supporters, while marginalizing the left and also downplaying & lying about their policy intentions. Why does everyone want to blame Bernie supporters?  His strategy of \u201cpicking his battles\u201d served him pretty well as far as I can see, and if he had only been able to reform healthcare in some way, it would have been a historic accomplishment. As it was, he drew people\u2019s attention to this still urgent issue. People in the Democrat party want to blame Bernie supporters because they still can\u2019t blame Hillary or the many consultants she wasted hundreds of millions of dollars on. Just like we will hear about the $250 million Musk gave Trump II all day long, but hardly anything about the $1.5 billion Harris lit on fire during her campaign.  Bernie not only talked about real issues, he threatened to do something about them if elected. The people in charge of the Democrats could not then and cannot now permit that to happen. Hence, we are where we are. It\u2019s not just party leaders though. A few years back, David Autor, a labor economist during the Clinton administration and one of the architects of the prophesied Giant Sucking Sound that was promised with China entering the WTO, was asked to reflect on his role in destroying labor in the US. This was during an NPR interview around 2018 I think. Despite all the evidence, he still couldn\u2019t say he made a mistake. He complained that they needed more data at the time. That\u2019s where the Democrats are. 10 years after the planet is destroyed they\u2019ll defend their positions as acceptable because they didn\u2019t have enough data to understand what they were doing was going to start WWIII. After we\u2019ve already recovered from the next Depression, they\u2019ll recommend going back to theories from people like Larry Summers because we can\u2019t really say they were to blame, can we? re: \u201cthey still can\u2019t blame Hillary or the many consultants she wasted hundreds of millions of dollars on.\u201d Um, yeah, her campaign sounded so much like the \u2018old boys club\u2019 stuff translated to (new) old girls club stuff.  Hill\u2019s running as the wife of someone with old boy connections?  As a second generation feminist that didn\u2019t really translate to me as progress. So David Autor\u2019s strategy is \u201cSit tight and assess\u201d? https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0-GVe2McaDA (54 secs) biden got booted for being old. i\u2019d imagine it would be the same for sanders. id also imagine kamala is also popular only because of her name recognition thanks to her failed 2024 campaign. warren is decent in her anti monopoly policies. unfortunately she is extremely white woman professor. \u201ci have a plan for that\u201d is a line that appeals to a specific group of people. warren just doesnt have the populist swag of trump which is an L when it comes to convincing people to listen to you. im hoping some rando decides to run and spice up the pot. id say the dems need a candidate of change away from the mainstream democratic party ala obama to win. (regardless of if they\u2019re actually pro change or not.) I used to think Warren was great\u2026. until\u2026. she showed she\u2019d sell out for a promotion.  See her attack on Sanders as a sexist.  That was her \u2018Zelensky at the Whitehouse\u2019 moment to me, and about as effective. adding: as we learned later, O was not a change from the mainstream Dem party, he only campaigned that way. Campaigned as a New Dealer (like C had done) and governed neoliberal and neocon (as C had done).  B did the same thing.  Remember how B was touted as the \u2018next FDR\u2019 in his 2020 run?  Joe Biken: our new FDR. It\u2019s like a pattern or something. \/ ;) Biden was booted because he was a senile fool who had a firmer grasp on his nap schedule than the economy or the many wars his handlers started during his term. People can be OK with old, hence Bernie and the Dead still doing the touring thing. But old and clueless? That, they can\u2019t handle. I don\u2019t know how general this opinion is,, but from my swamp adjacent post, this is what I see\u2026 There isn\u2019t a single person in our government currently who couldn\u2019t make things better by resigning. There isn\u2019t a single main stream media analyst who couldn\u2019t improve the conversation by losing their voice. Most business leaders could improve their companies by retiring early and naming no successor. The US is a failed state. Our critical needs for the human condition are experiencing concurrent market failures. Healthcare, housing, food, education, energy, have all been manipulated to the point where nothing makes sense. We are just starting to make teeny, tiny, baby steps, to talk about this complete failure of government at all levels. Already, the \u201cLeft\u201d hates it. We are not going to move past these troubles until we accept the failure and excise the \u201cliberals\u201d who have been in government for the last 50 years. Even then, if by some miracle that were to occur, we will still face the challenge of focusing on our internal politics rather than engaging in more wars of choice. So we\u2019d need to somehow prevent Russo and Islamo phobia from infecting the next class of leaders. In short, I see the US splintering into multiple regional confederacies long before Russia does, or before we address any of these problems. But maybe my coffee is too dark this morning. I\u2019ll think about it some more after I\u2019ve added some sweeter cream. >In short, I see the US splintering into multiple regional confederacies long before Russia does, or before we address any of these problems.

However, I want to add  Chungking Express:  in my opinion, Wong Kar-Wai\u2019s best work, partly because I was in Hong Kong in the early 1990s, and watching it brings up waves of nostalgia, for Hong Kong, and for my long lost youth. Not to mention, Chungking Express redefined what can be accomplished in a romcom, and I\u2019m still in love with Faye Wong\u2026 Chungking Express is one of my all time favourite movies \u2013 I\u2019ve watched it so many times (not just because of Faye Wong\u2026).  I haven\u2019t watched it for a while, it\u2019s a good reminder to do so.  Hong Kong cinema was always so good, sadly it was one of the biggest casualties of streaming and pirating and various crackdowns, its a very thin shadow of its former self.   The fifth Generation (1980\u2019s) Chinese films are amazing \u2013 as a movie obsessed student I fell in love with the incredible aesthetics.  It\u2019s such a shame that there has been such a marked drop off in quality since then.  Taiwan also had a wonderful film industry at that time, which has never quite hit those peaks again.  I guess these things come in waves, but for now South Korea seems to consistently produce the very best cinema from Asia. \u2026..but for now South Korea seems to consistently produce the very best cinema from Asia I agree all the way!  Too bad they\u2019re cutting out the free streaming sites. Loved Chungking Express, and also \u201cComrades A Love Story\u201d.  Mickey 17, the new Korean film by \u201cParasite\u201d director Bong Joon Ho is pretty good too. That\u2019s a useful article for all the streaming links. While I watch a lot of movies I\u2019ve only seen a few on the list and some that probably should be on the list (Zhang Yimou is, in my just admitted limited experience, the best). Of course all such lists are quirky and opinionated including the famous Sight and Sound best films of all time list. As a noted film critic once said, \u201ctaste is the great divider.\u201d I\u2019m surprised that YI Yi (2000) wasn\u2019t included, one of my all-time favorites.

Jack surprised me with it. Well, he has excellent taste. Yes. But I nearly spoiled the surprise. How\u2019s that? I walked in on him when he was ordering it on the phone. Really? What did you hear him say? I heard him say that he wanted to buy a collar. That\u2019s funny. You heard him on the phone buying a collar. What\u2019s so funny about that?

It\u2019s another new expression that I\u2019ve learned\u2026 buying a collar. Do you want to explain to your fianc\u00e9e what it means? Maybe I should. It means collaring your position on your stock options. It\u2019s a quiet way of dumping your stocks without sending up a flare as to what you\u2019re doing. The diamond pet collar page has been taken down. Too many *ahem* specialist customers?  I\u2019ll be honest and admit I think just about those specialist uses just about as often as one for a pet dog or cat\u2026.. but I\u2019ve mixed with some very non-mainstream groups in my time (but no I am not into that particular area of interest\u2026.. being gay in big cities in UK and Australia does tend to open your eyes)  The stock option interpretation is interesting thanks.

Why are we bombing school libraries?  Why is our media not highlighting this?  Why do we have to look at alternative media that many times has its own agenda to get hopefully true information?   There are multiple other tweets of charred little kid bodies from yesterday,  but I won\u2019t share those.  You can find them if you want to look.  I am surrounded by kids that age in every aspect of my life.  It is heartbreaking to see these photos.  Where is our main stream media? There have also been so many photos of Gaza Orthodox Christians and all the kids surrounding the altars during this Lenten time.  In their churches with two walls bombed out, etc.  Why is our media not reporting these things? The tweet with the young man with the books is a poignant series of photos.  He risked his life for those books.  But even more poignant to me is there are probably more books in his apartment than in many medical school libraries I have been to lately.  All digital all the time nowadays.  I am of course exaggerating, but the point is the same.  That young man surrounded by books was a photo of a lost and dying world \u2013 in so many more ways than one. > Doesn\u2019t add any news value that the article from AP does not provide.

Stock market blues, 2025 edition.  Well talking heads from the CNBC are all too unhappy with all this negativity, primarily such negative vibes being directed from the Trump administration.  Unlike the first term of Hair Trump, when touting S&P successes was a continuing theme. We\u2019re not in Trading Places territory* though for my half glass empty opinion, it seems to be a period of lull and lollygagging whilst one impatiently waits for the next administration hammer to drop circa April 2.

So \u2018Trump has repeatedly insisted the US needs a missile defense program similar to Israel\u2019s Iron Dome.\u2019 First consider the differences. Israel\u2019s border is only in the low hundreds of miles in length so there is not much area to defend. Now the continental US alone has a total of 5,525 miles (8,891 km) of border so that is going to require a massive networked defense system so the two countries cannot be compared. And should it be mentioned that Iranian missiles made it through the Iron Dome causing it to be nicknamed the Iron Colander? At the heart of this is a dream. Once the US was immune to attack because it had an ocean on each side and friendly neighbours to the north and south. But missiles put an end to this meaning that though the US could nuke other countries, some of those other countries could nuke the US in turn. So there is this dream that if only the US develop a sort of force field around it, it could do whatever it wanted to do any nobody could hit back like it was before WW2. That was what Reagan\u2019s Star Wars program was all about and so it is with Trump\u2019s Golden Dome. Why doesn\u2019t Trump just contract The Jedi to protect America? So much easier and they likely would refuse to be paid so less expensive, too. And personally I for one don\u2019t really believe Yoda is dead. Reagan had the right idea with his \u201cStar Wars\u201d plan. He just tried to implement it in the wrong way. Even back in the 1980s, the \u201cStar Wars\u201d defense theory was pretty much shot full of holes. The test systems never worked well enough to be certified as being actually \u201cprotective\u201d of the Continental US. Back then, the main proponents of the \u201cStar Wars\u201d program were the Paleo Neoliberals, and the Technocrats. Both of those groups partook more of the characteristics of cults than rational thinkers. The same can be said of today\u2019s \u201cNew Star Wars\u201d promoters. Roughly speaking, items such as the \u201cStar Wars\u201d project fall under the classification of \u201cWunderwaffen.\u201d They offer a \u2018quick fix\u2019 for what are really long term and difficult to address problems. Just as rational observers say that \u201cA Government is not a Business,\u201d so too one can say that \u201cWar is not just Equipment.\u201d To this end, it is instructional to observe that \u2018Techno\u2019 is not human. Thus, \u2018Technobros\u2019 fail the Turing Test. Back in \u201cYe Goode Olde Dayes,\u201d psychopaths, sociopaths, and many of those further along \u2018the Spectrum\u2019 were institutionalized. This was both to \u201chelp\u201d the afflicted, and to \u201cprotect\u201d society. Now, the formerly institutionalized are managing the Institutions that underlie the functioning of our society. Is it any wonder then that we see chaos and madness all around us today? The Inmates are running the Asylum. Stay safe. Remain vigilant. I remember getting a tour of the Massachusetts Cape Cod area during the Reagan Star Wars era. I was informed that a lot of the vacation homes were now owned by academics who made good money on Star Wars consulting. So Reagan Star Wars was good for some in liberal Mass. It is hard for change to occur when the money is flowing. This is a plot from an old movie called king of hearts with Alan bates. During world war ll a town in Italy is taken over by the inmates of an insane asylum. When the Allie\u2019s show up, they think the town is normal. I remember that film showing at the Saturday Midnight Show in a small theatre on Magazine Street in New Orleans. The campus art film series was good as well. 16mm prints shown in a smaller auditorium on campus, often on a Thursday night. Oh my, King of Hearts, ages ago at Cento Cedar Cinema San Francisco\u2026 https:\/\/cinematreasures.org\/theaters\/1947 That figure of 5,525 miles doesn\u2019t include coastline. And if you add in the 51st state and Greenland\u2026 That\u2019s a lot of territory to try to defend. Maybe if he waits until the 23rd century he can adopt deflector screens, phasers and photon torpedoes to defend America with. You mean Red, White, and Blueland . Wouldn\u2019t be funny if the Inatsisartut \u2013 the Greenland Parliament \u2013 sent the sponsor of that bill one of their own saying that they want to re-designate the United States as South-West Greenland.

Re. the comments above about digital media taking over the information sphere; digital media are becoming literally impossible to watch. (Before you post well meaning advice; I already use several a- b\u2014\u2014s. Some sites, such as Yahoo Mail{!!!!} are now interfering with my access to email with \u201cTerms of Service\u201d warnings and time limits on access to my email queue.)

I got out of stocks and decided to put an equal amount into real estate, now essentially my new and improved 401K\u2026if not really that legally. I now have a home that the internet says goes up in value almost every month and generates a nice rental income. Caveat \u2013 a prolonged stock slump would likely affect me however. Smith and the Classicals had a term for that: rentiers. They didn\u2019t like them. Just saying. I\u2019m not saying I wouldn\u2019t do what you\u2019ve done if I wanted to protect a retirement income I\u2019ll probably never live to receive.  But I wouldn\u2019t boast about it. Well, maybe you didn\u2019t have friends who lived in Boston\u2019s South End decades ago. I did. When young, I\u2019d visit them at their condo\u2019s before we went out clubbing together. They\u2019d brag how the condos they retained as investments before they upgraded to their new bigger condo, was like an ATM machine. The rent flowed and increased. Always. Money in their pockets every month. I\u2019ve now moved to Knoxville. The same thing is happening just on a smaller scale. I\u2019m not going to let that boat sail past me a second time. So do I proudly boast? To paraphrase a movie line\u2026\u201dAbso-f&ck\u2019n-lutely.\u201d I\u2019ve found a way to mitigate the Fed\u2019s stock market put and am proud of it. Only regret is, I should have done so sooner instead of later. Comparing backgrounds is very tiresome. I was born in a literal slum (at home,  back to back Victorian issue with no bathroom in Nottingham). I went on to present to senior members of the UK govt in Whitehall in 2009. I knew that I could sell out and get into property but I chose to try to improve health care. 11pm conference calls were daily occurrence because my two collaborators were based West coast Canada and Sydney. I didn\u2019t succeed but proud that I tried. I put myself above anyone who boasts about being a rentier. If even the high priest of right wing economics thought I was a drain on society then I\u2019d be rethinking life. Isn\u2019t it about time that we all stopped \u201cputting\u201d ourselves \u201cabove\u201d each other, no matter on what terms? What\u2019s the difference between a rentier who draws income from the stock market and one who draws income from a rental property? Nobody needs to be in the stock market. One thing I dislike about leftists is all the lefter-than-thou games they like to play. Yes, it was a smart move to put money in real estate, good for you.  The problem is we have a real shortage of affordable homes, because of a storm of factors like the 08 storm,  the covid hiccup, builders building only \u2018luxury\u2019, and rentiers large and small snapping up and holding most of the housing inventory, and jacking up rents because they can.   Young couples locked out of the market are not impressed. \u201cThe problem is we have a real shortage of affordable homes\u2026\u201d What does that have to with my investment house? I rented it in comparative record time in part because firstly I attended with detail and diligence to fixing repairing and upgrading what needed to be, then listing it $400 less than a similar to identical house around the corner in the same HOA, which was owned by a real estate broker. She ended up lowering her asking rent twice until it matched mine\u2026and likely lost 2 to 3 months rent vs myself. Both the various contractors AND listing agents repeatedly complimented me saying \u201ctenants really appreciate landlords who attend to repairs promptly\u201d. In other words, I contribute to affordable housing. Listing agents said my investment home received the greatest traffic amongst all their listing\u2019s by far. Perhaps you should have led with that. As an academic who mixed with academic marketers for 20 years this makes you sound much more socially responsible. Just a thought. \u201cPerhaps you should have led with that.\u201d Why? That would have completely changed the subject of my post. As a fellow small fry when it comes to owning a home or single family residence intended for rental, I\u2019d encourage the capability to maintain your dwelling whilst keeping up with the recent and likely continuing increase in maintenance, repairs upkeep and insurance.  I never wanted a real estate empire of my own so my effort at doing this for the past 19 years has remained in one sole property.  Reaching the point in time where I give serious consideration to sell and shuffle onto something newer. It isn\u2019t always rainbows or unicorns, and I keep a watchful eye to correct and repair items as soon I\u2019m informed of it.  There are indeed approaches that can work for each party. I have neighbors who did just that with the houses on either side of them.  When age and bad health got the best of them after having the same tenants for more than a decade, the tenants ended up buying those houses at a reasonable price. That\u2019s in contrast to the typical types of landlords who own properties here.  There are few holdovers from pre-\u201908 period around here, but those that remain are generally scummy slumlords who don\u2019t maintain their properties.  The new corporate style around here still seems aimed at scamming.  A house gets transferred from one LLC to another while wildly escalating in price at each transfer even though there\u2019s been no improvement of the property.  We\u2019ll see if they stop paying taxes like they did the last time. So there are landlords and there are landlords.  I appreciate your approach to the practice. Very Interesting comments to my circumstances especially the age and bad health issue. I thought about that. I am healthy and vigorous 60+ now. Now, it works financially. But I wiil become old and lose my health. When I get too old and loss my health, I told my ex-husband 24 years my junior, that he inherents my properties. I work in home Healthcare since I relocated to Tennessee and I see folks near the end of their life and how it affects their lives and property. That will be me someday. That\u2019s when I pass it onto him. Someone I still love. That helps make it all worth it. aye. thats what cousin is moving up here to do. buy cheap property, build a decent house on it, and rent it for less than the old school local slumlords. i reckon thats god\u2019s work, right there. if i had actually inherited anything from my dad(pretended pretty well to be a rich guy, but had blown my grandad\u2019s fortune 20 years before)\u2026thats what i would have done. im to be the local fixer dude\u2026know who the neighbors are, what precinct its in, and am to be introducing him to the more ethical and decent local players. theres land out here, outside of odious city rules, thats been on the market forever\u2026but aint listed. i know where the water is, and can look at a place and tell him if its likely to have it, given geology. he pays well, too,lol\u2026inherited (like i did) our grandads\u2019 philosophy of treating yer workers well, so they love you\u2026develops loyalty, etc. so his arrival is looking to be a boon for me, too. If residential renting is so great, why are there laws preventing you from using so-called \u201cpassive losses\u201d for income tax AGI? Eh, Mom & Pop landlords are usually the first to sink, even if they aren\u2019t leveraged. Unlike stocks it requires upkeep and maintenance on the part of the retail owner. The purpose is to have a balanced portfolio so that downturns in the equity markets are an opportunity instead of suffocating. Good luck. Hope your outcomes match your confidence. Well, my friends in Boston South End were neither Mom & Pops nor did they sink. Listening to the way the term \u2018boomers\u2019 is used in the media sounds like the term is not only about age but also about class: \u2018boomers\u2019 as the minority of that post-wwII birth generation that went to college, got credentials and good jobs and rode the upward mobility escalator.  The term is often used as an age + class shorthand.  I seldom hear the term used in a way that suggests the poor or the working class or the \u2018right sized\u2019 out of jobs are part of the \u2018boomers\u2019 the in the speakers\u2019 or authors\u2019 minds. No.  It\u2019s the successful and important politicians, academics, business people, and professionals, of a certain age that are being referenced. Substitute \u201cmiddle class\u201d for boomers. I imagine most everybody is \u201cin big trouble\u201d these days whatever the market decides to do. I agree.  I wish the MSM would report it that way. Yep. I suspect the term stuck because they happened to be a large age cohort. There are indeed a lot of that cohort who live in the terrible conditions you describe.  You don\u2019t see \u201cGeneration X\u201d much in news items or social media discourse,  despite the fact we are even more bifurcated by class. Why? Because we\u2019re a smaller segment of society. We don\u2019t matter (in population terms). The way \u201cboomers\u201d is used in articles like this makes it easier to create a divide between younger and older people for political purposes. Like the Republican politician who said we shouldn\u2019t be paying for medical care for sick old people because it was their \u201cpoor lifestyle choices\u201d that made them sick. But, yes, the image projected is that all boomers (which I\u2019ll say are all people conceived between V-E day and Kennedy\u2019s assassination) are sitting on big stock portfolios, when, just like the American people overall, it\u2019s a not large minority of boomers that have any kind of stock portfolio big enough to be worth taking note of. And most of those portfolios were built after the bipartisan push to get rid of defined benefits (pensions) and turn everyone into investors (401-Ks), which was nothing we asked for but something forced on us (like the privatized Medicare Part D, Medicare Advantage, and Obamacare). The uniparty will use every possible tactic to divide us against each other as they\u2019re picking our pockets. The early Boomers cohort I know have started to slowly shuffle off this mortal coil, fading away with various maladies, especially strokes, and thereafter dementia. It\u2019s not pretty and something very disturbing that I\u2019ve noticed is that most are not given any funeral or memorial service these days. Just immediate family. And always cremation, even a Jewish  (albeit secular) friend, which shocked me. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s Covid but these are not expected passings. An era is closing in a very weird way. Yeah I see that too. As a Gen X person who\u2019s had a heart condition from birth I\u2019m also clock watching. Had my will drawn up 2 months ago.  In the special requests letter I demanded no funeral or memorial service (main will dictates cremation). As far as I\u2019m concerned (particularly with regard to the weird increase in insularity mentioned on this site) my legacy is my textbook.  No more,  no less. Hamrick said investors should regularly review their risk appetite, asset allocation, and investment time horizon to make sure they\u2019re on track. He also advised paying down debts and boosting emergency savings to weather hard times. Boomers rode the bull market to riches, but stocks don\u2019t care about their retirement plans. Unless they protect their nest eggs, they risk spending their golden years bagging groceries instead of lounging on the beach. Which Boomers? I hate these articles, with a taint of generational warfare. What\u2019s clear to me is that Mayo Pete is past his sell by date.  I\u2019ll take cold comfort in that. He does do a good impersonation of  O speechifying. \/ ;) Religion desk. Papa Francesco leaves Gemelli hospital to convalesce back in Vatican City https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=hdMVNHQUn6E I think that he\u2019s doing this just to annoy the conservatives (like JD Vance and his nutcase spiritual advisors) who had him dead, in the grave, and were organizing the antipasti at the Conclave. As a bad Catholic and a bad Buddhist, I have a certain respect for Pope Francis, who has been consistently against the wars \/ slaughters in Ukraine-Russia and Palestine-Israel. Supposedly, he calls the pastor of the Catholic church in Gaza every evening to check on him. And there are plenty of rumors that Francis has kept up a dialogue with Russian diplomats.  Here in the Chocolate City, where all the major churches belong to Mary, the Mother of God, the ethic is similar to that of Francis \u2014 after all, he is of Piedmontese descent and has cousins here.  I have also learned to monitor \/ comprehend \/ puzzle out the relation between Catholicism as an emanation of Italian culture, and Italian culture as an emanation of Roman culture and Catholic practice. Like Shinto, with its eight million gods, Italy is the land of eight million saints and apparitions \u2014 and who knows what the Etruscans were up to, religiously, with their interpretation of lightning bolts. When Papa Francesco eventually falls off his perch, just wait for Trump and Vance to start demanding that an American bishop be made the next Pope. Can the Papal State be sanctioned? :) iirc, Vatican City\/Holy See was not recognized by the USA until the Reagan administration. Something to do with the conspiracy around Lincoln\u2019s assassination and general Catholic hatred. So I guess the answer is yes. Kennedy was RC and society got over that.  However the increasing power of certain sects like Southern Baptists might make the USA more \u201cemphatic\u201d in supporting certain types of cardinals. Interesting times ahead. As a very much ex catholic, I\u2019ve found it hard not to respect him \u2013 he has undoubtedly stalled \u2013 for now \u2013 the rapid decline of the Church, and he seems profoundly decent and he has skilfully put a lid on the worst excesses of the Church hierarchy.  Even my very deeply conservative catholic American relatives like him. A couple of months ago I had a fun time watching the film Conclave in the cinema with my very atheist best Chinese buddy \u2013 I spent half the film whispering in her ear trying to answer her questions about what was going on.  It\u2019s always enlightening to have to explain sometime from scratch to someone who genuinely doesn\u2019t know (\u2018those tasty looking white wafers represent bread, which represents Gods body, and the wine\u2026..\u2019) You\u2019re lucky that when you explained to her about the wafers representing bread and the wine that she did not ask \u2018But isn\u2019t that ritualistic cannibalism?\u2019 i have had that conversation so many times. i make sure to tell them the cannibalism is ok because it\u2019s consensual. and the wafers are NOT tasty. Eat his body, drink his blood And we\u2019ll sing a song of love. Vatican II ditty from my youth. matt: \u201ci make sure to tell them the cannibalism is ok because it\u2019s consensual.\u201d You have a great future ahead of you as a theologian. Armin Meiwes tried that defense. As kids, we used to call communion wafers \u201cJeez-Its\u201d.  For the non-USA crowd, it\u2019s a reference to the Cheez-It brand of snack food. I remember serving Catholic Mass as an altar boy in elementary school. It was a different view seeing people I knew sticking their tongues out for the priest to deposit the wafer.  The altar boy held a platen? under the parishioner\u2019s face, ostensibly to catch fallen host crumbs, so the altar boy had a good view. It was a good way to go to church service,  one got to ring bells, walk around the sacristy, provide water and wine to the priest a couple of times in the service, spout some Latin, light candles and smell incense (funerals). Much more interesting that sitting\/kneeling in a pew. One can move away from a religion, but the memories remain. > \u2018those tasty looking white wafers represent bread, which represents Gods body \u2026\u2019 Fellow \u2018very much ex catholic\u2019 here. There at the cinema, in medias res as it were, this was surely adequate and for an ex catholic it is a perfectly reasonable explanation. No need to shock your Chinese friend \u2014 and maybe some uninformed readers here at NC \u2014 by telling her that for True Believers, there is no representation involved; that through the miracle of Transubstantiation those wafers are in fact the body of Christ \u2014 and if you don\u2019t believe that with all your heart you are simply not a proper catholic. Yes, the idea is that the Eucharist is transformed as a \u201cmystery\u201d into the \u201cbody, blood, soul, and divinity\u201d of Christ. Luther rejected transubstantiation as a human add-on when the \u201cWord of God\u201d alone was all that was required.  Accused by his Roman enemies of being a heretic when it came to the Real Presence because of his rejection of transubstantiation, Luther legendarily knelt on the stone church floor and licked every drop of spilled wine from it when there was a mishap during communion. As for the practice of taking the wafer on the tongue or common cup, as one who has been on the delivering end, it\u2019s an insane practice, but it\u2019s become a matter of faith to some. I too have respect for him for the same reasons even if not feeling Catholic from when I was a teenager. A sea change from previous Catholic Terminators. You can see he is a human being, and quite probably a decent one, not detached from the realities of the world. PlutoniumKun: Ever the diplomat, \u201cAs a very much ex catholic, I\u2019ve found it hard not to respect him.\u201d I am roughly in the same religio-theologico zone as you are. Yet the problem with Catholicism, if it is a problem, is that like every great religion \u2014 Buddhism, Shinto, Islam \u2014 it is also a culture. You mention being able to explain the doctrinal side of Conclave.  I have been in the same boat \u2014 explaining to friends, especially those from the U.S. non-liturgical churches: \u201cOh, that\u2019s Saint Lawrence being toasted on the grill. And, yep, Saint Lucy is the one with the eyeballs. And there is Saint Agatha with her breasts on a plate.\u201d And as Es S Cetera mentions below, people like J.D. Vance want to get into the Catholic church because they perceive it as a hierarchy they can exploit, when, in fact, it is a big buzzing mess of a thing. Like the Oracle at Delphi. St. Lawrence:  Turn me over.  I\u2019m done on this side. St. Denis:  Hey, look. I\u2019m  holding my head in my hands. Only some-time-Catholics would find these efunny, no doubt\u2026. :P I did find it funny that overwhelming majority of my friends (without any design) are ex-Catholics.  The culture thing, even across national-cultural boundaries, is a real factor. In a sign that I\u2019m still not an \u201cex-\u201cCatholic, despite all the apperances, I never give a straight answer about transsubstantiation (something that my more genuinely ex-Catholic friends humrously exploit often).  They think, rightly, I suppose my circuitous and likely completely cloudcuckooland, non-answers very funny.  No doubt not-ever-Catholics would find this utterly baffling. Perhaps another way to explain this to your buddy is that the wafers are identifying as the body of Christ, and anyone who questions this is being waferphobic.  So the Church had a ~ 2000 year headstart on IDpol! Zing!!!! The Catholic church itself is quietly undergoing a reformation under his leadership.  He didn\u2019t start it, of course, I would put the start at John Paul II or Benedict XVI, but under Francis we\u2019ve seen an overhauling of the curia (allowing women, for example, in leadership roles), overhauling Vatican finances, instituting radical anti-corruption reforms, a sexual abuse reporting hotline and procedures for dealing with reports (priests are automatically removed and replaced during investigation).  Suddenly we see a rise in altar-girls supplementing altar-boys, and we see many more women EMHC\u2019s.  We see Catholic women preaching online (CatholicWomenPreach.org), we see the possibility of a strike if one of the takeaways of the Synod of Synodalities, namely allowing women to preach, isn\u2019t implemented.  With Laudato Si he\u2019s turned the church toward a more caregiving attitude of the planet (much like his namesake saint, but also, like the very first gardener (God)).  We see the rise of Catholic climate change groups.   With Fratelli Tutti he\u2019s changed the role of the church toward pastoral care rather than Pharisiac judgement.   With Fiducia Supplicans he\u2019s radically altered the Church stance toward the LGBT community, even (non-liturgical) blessing same-sex couples.   Elsewhere, during one of his earlier encyclicals, he quietly reversed the excommunication of women for having abortions, instead emphasizing the need to care for them, bring them back to the church. All of the above are reasons why some so-called Catholics unfamiliar with the history and saints of their own church, like Vance, would want to see his demise. Agreed. Refused to go to funeral of great aunt who was a nun. She SAID all the stuff you report as to why he is great. However never accepted me as gay.

Lampocteis cruentiventer is a ctenophore (comb jelly, not closely related to jellyfish).  There is good evidence that ctenophores were the first truly multicellular animals.  Deep down in the biology nerdisphere is also good evidence they have an opening at both ends of their digestive tracts, which is revolutionary.

Eight rows of beating cilia (ctene = comb) that are iridescent when light is shining on them.  I\u2019ve seen many in the Pacific Northwest of North America but nothing like this one. Any theories out there about some of the Ediacaran fauna being ctenophores? They are so weird looking\u2026 Great question!  They may predate the Ediacaran according to the master evolutionary clock, which is quite good I think, but are unlikely to have left any fossil evidence because they are very soft.  There are a few Edicaran fossils that look like bioluminescent sea pens (Pennatulacea) but a paleontologist friend says they are different from the Edicaran fossils.

My guess is that armed satellites are seen as the strategy for the US to regain control of weaponry in every domain: land, sea, air, space. And as part of the strategy robots are being developed to operate in space as part of the space war. No spacesuits needed.

People will read this and say haw, haw, he thinks it all a real estate deal when it is actually about the security of different countries. But then you read this section- \u2018Trump proposed the U.S. take ownership of some of Ukraine\u2019s power plants as a way of providing protection in the future. \u201cAmerican ownership of those plants would be the best protection for that infrastructure and support for Ukrainian energy infrastructure,\u201d national security adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a joint statement after Trump\u2019s one-hour call with Zelensky.\u2019 So when you think about it, isn\u2019t this Trump sneaking through the back door security guarantees for the Ukraine? And how the US will then be fully embedded in the affairs of that country? And that means that the US will never get out of that country? I see no difference between how the U.S. would react to someone blowing up anything some U.S. citizen or company \u201cowns\u201d in Stalin\u2019s SSR than it reacts to someone killing U.S. personnel in Odessa. The burden of grabbing Zelenski\u2019s bacon is beyond US capacity. Gotta buy the F-47. Who will tell Trump you can not get there?

My political instincts are still to drown the party and try to rebirth progressive anti-elite populism. In their scorched Earth campaign, Democrats have done their best to discredit that idea as well.

How Los Angeles Is Getting Scorched by Its Homeless Problem RealClearInvestigations ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ As per the article, nobody in charge wants to talk about homeless fires getting out of control in the Big Smokes and causing mayhem-these people have led careless lives, so no real surprise\u2026 \u2026how do we fix the situation? To solve homelessness one would have to attack the whole FIRE sector and bring real estate prices down to what regular people could afford. Without rent control, or heavily taxing everyone who owns multiple properties as investment vehicles, the only option is to move people into vacant properties regardless of the ownership. We really need something like in the 30\u2019s, when tenant unions made it impossible to evict renters from apartment buildings, or the penny auctions that gave homesteads back to the foreclosed, or the widespread assaults on eviction judges and sheriffs. But as this current system creates and requires widespread poverty, the homeless population will continue to grow.  I was disappointed by Ana Kasparian\u2019s article, she never suggests any solutions to poverty, only fear mongering and criminalizing people who have no power over the economic system that threw them overboard. She never interviews any homeless people, and judging by her constant barrage of unfounded assumptions, she doesn\u2019t even know any homeless people, even though they\u2019re a sizable part of the LA population. But she must understand that people who are discarded by a society and who are relegated into a second-class citizenship shouldn\u2019t show any loyalty or respect to that society. If you had no place to live and everyone treated you like an pariah, wouldn\u2019t you burn things down? Affordable housing for the 40% or more of the homeless that work plus the rest of those who have income from social security and the like followed by the building of housing for everyone else? But I am told that this is crazy commie talk\u2026 Not in Los Angeles. Two weeks after a huge calamity like those fires, all is forgotten and life goes on. I went through one (the Old Topanga Canyon-Malibu Fire, 1992), and the scale of those incidents is indescribable. The solutions are available, viz Singapore and Vienna \u2014 the state must return to building public housing, and LOTS of it \u2026 Came across this\u2026 (Yes, THAT Mitch McConnell) https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=F7g3NAEOU4k 1990 Mitch McConnell Senate Campaign Ad Running On Healthcare After His Polio Scare If I were a Bezos, Ellison or Zuckerberg I\u2019d be worried that Elon is now the Don\u2019s favorite snugglebunny and I\u2019d be asking myself what could be done to ensure I wouldn\u2019t be sucking hind teat. The Donald has let everyone know that he wants his bust on Mt Rushmore, a wonderful idea, however it\u2019s not just about enhancing the retirements of a few decision makers, Congress would get involved which would delay things forever. The answer is simple, buy a Mountain with similar geology and re name it the REAL MT RUSHMORE, which will let everyone know that the so called original is the FAKE Mt Rushmore. Clearly the Donald\u2019s Bust should be front and center, flanked by busts of lesser Presidents like George Washington and William McKinley. It should also be twice the size of the other busts and gilded with 24 Karat Gold to emphasize that Trump is the GREATEST PRESIDENT EVER!!! USA!, USA!, USA! Why buy one then you can just grab one?

Hey Elon watch this RE:  Trump hangs sword of Damocles over the American legal system I am not a fan of ransacking the legal system, but I don\u2019t remember Politico being so concerned when it was Biden and the Democrats finding \u201cnovel\u201d ways to use lawfare to go after the Donald  \u2013  they still haven\u2019t tired of noting the \u201c34 felonies\u201d brought about through jerry-rigged jurisprudence, turning an accounting entry using an antiquating dropdown menu into the crime of the century. Several months ago just after the election,  I was at the dinner table with a US Congressperson who was very frightened that Trump might turn the legal system against the Democrats.  My better half turned to this elected official and said \u201cIsn\u2019t that what the Democrats did to Trump over the last few years?\u201d.  The Congressperson was a little taken aback, hearing this question coming from a liberal, but one not afflicted with TDS.  \u201cWell I suppose that\u2019s one way to look at it\u201d was the reply, with zero recognition of the inherent hypocrisy of it all. On the one hand I of course agree \u2013 on the other the question will come up whether or not the Trump Admin. attacks now are a qualitative shift compared to what the Dems did . I have the impression the jury is still out.  Besides as to what matters probably the most \u2013 will 80% of the population by 2028 be as bad off as they were before 2025?

Disneylandish reporting here. It\u2019s on like Donkey Kong: The Canadian federal election has been called for April 28. Carney leads in the polls by only a couple of points. What are the odds that both Labour (UK) and the Democrat Party (US) send \u201caction teams\u201d to Canada to \u2018assist\u2019 their political BFFs? Transnationalism is going big lately. It seems the UK doesn\u2019t have to send an action team because the first thing Carney did when he became Prime Minister was to head right over the Atlantic and meet with his classmate Starmer, the King, and Macron. To receive his marching orders, I presume. Next stop, Goldman Sachs. IIRC it is illegal. Elections Canada and the RCMP might not be amused. Yes, but Transnationals care nothing for \u201cindividual nation states\u201d and their laws. Everything is \u201cHidden Hand\u201d and the \u201cMandate of Finance\u201d to them. True but it can be difficult to campaign from a jail cell and everyone from your citizen on the street to the head of Elections Canada is likely to be on the look-out and have the RCMP on speed-dial. when i see one of \u201cthose people\u201d in jail,i\u2019ll throw a frelling party. cuzthataintgonnahappen,lol. ill throw a party anyways, because thats how i roll, and get through this torrential nonsense, but still It\u2019s Canada amfortas. Think of it as Austin with good French cuisine. I read that Canada \u2018outsourced\u2019 their homelessness. They call it Detroit. I\u2019m really curious as to how this plays out. I totally understand the Canadian existential threat and how Carney represents the \u201cultimate insider who can protect them\u201d. Yet I also saw the desire for change. This might turn out to be similar to the British 1992 election. We had \u201cchange\u201d (Major not Thatcher) but elected same party to the lower house. It rapidly went downhill for Major and in retrospect many Tories regretted that win, given what happened in 1997. It is going to be interesting. Carney has a \u201cnew face\u201d advantage versus Poilievre and I suspect a fair number of Canadians see Poilievre as a bit like Trump in his policies and for that matter some of his supporters.  Currently being like Donald Trump is not a vote-getter in Canada. Poilievre\u2019s campaign has been mainly \u201cHate Trudeau\u201d and, oops, Trudeau is gone and Poilievre has almost no time to retool his campaign. It\u2019s a short election campaign, thirty-six days from counting from today. As opposed to this, Carney has never fought a campaign in his life. It will be interesting to see how many votes Poilievre gets in Alberta.    See what percent of Albertans are Canadian and what percent are Maganadian. \u201cHate Trudeau\u201d and, oops, Trudeau is gone\u201d Yes, I saw a report on Poilievre\u2019s recent campaign speech two days ago. The headline was, \u201cI\u2019m tough! says Poilievre.\u201d I kid you not. Rick Salutin (Toronto Star, 22 Dec 2023) wrote that \u201c\u2026the NDP is a spent force. I don\u2019t know if they should fold into the Liberals but it would at least make sense of their existence. They\u2019d become the left wing of the Liberals, like Sanders for the Democrats and as Corbyn was for British Labour.\u201d  He has been a life long supporter of the NDP.  This gives some indication of the Carney \u201cwave\u201d which will not lift NDP boats as they vote across Canada to keep Poilievre out of power.  On cable (CBC and CTV) political programmes, weekdays, the paid Conservatives commentators were giddy prior to Trudeau\u2019s resignation. It was a done deal \u2013 Poilievre was shoe-in.  Immediately after Freeland crucified Trudeau, the Party let her know as she was trounced by Carney that she too was toast.  She was\/is a boring, pedantic and accident prone Deputy Leader.  And Freeland was rewarded accordingly in the leadership contest.  The Conservative commentators currently (since Carney won handily) let slip every now and then that Poilievre is past his best buy date.  Satirically referred as Skippy (15 year history on that epithet) the Conservatives are letting it be known that Skippy is finished and clearly he is no longer now or will be a political force in the future.  In Quebec historically a technocrat leader at the federal level is preferred to lip readers: come on down Poilievre.  Quebecois as a rule prefer a winner, to a loser \u2013 Poilievre. The NDP is going to get crushed and may not get Official Party status.  Singh\u2019s (NDP leader) vocabulary is watered social democracy and slides into PM McKenzie King\u2019s (PM in 1920s-1940s) assessment of the NDP as \u201cLiberals in a hurry\u201d.  This why the Liberals will crush the NDP and humiliate the Conservatives again.  Rudderless and unprincipled, Poilievre is about to be handed his backside.   Ginger Goodwin I don\u2019t relish the prospect of handing either the perennially arrogant Liberals nor the Poilievre infected Conservatives a majority mandate \u2014 I would prefer another minority government. Who\u2019s Going to Unite Europe on Defense?  I would frame the question in a different way. Instead of asking who I would ask what. There are instances in which a common approach might, and i say might with some doubts, truly result in consensus for good reason among most, if not all EU countries. The article mentions satellite intelligence and it is mentioned in the White Paper as the last point of the ReArm project. It should really be the first. IMO, European countries, because the \u201cNATO dividend\u201d, \u201cpeace dividend\u201d or whatever is called have mostly relied on the US for this function (probably the US wanted this because it gave them leverage). This is IMO, the easiest starting point for cooperation between EU countries: sharing intelligence and all that. Yet, UvdL couldn\u2019t help herself and wanted to create an instrument to help more deliveries  to Ukraine. Any project involving \u201cjoint purchases\u201d of a single EU country plus Ukraine would almost certainly be passed through the ReArm scheme automatically and this was probably the main objective of the project. My guess is that many countries are not wanting to spend any more in Ukraine even if the gates of debt ceilings are broken into pieces. UvdL may believe the contrary but probably most are starting to gather that this is a waste of everything.

Just like Ronald Reagan was.    Was this an article put here to test whether we were paying attention?    Same as the article about \u201d No Decency in the Democrats\u201d? Wow. This guy, Douglas MacKinnon, is f**king dumb. (a former White House and Pentagon official; that explain it I guess) Almost instantly, the knee-jerk policy for the Democrats \u2014 and their allies in the media, academia, science and medicine \u2014 was to oppose anything and everything said or proposed by Trump. It was as if a curtain of red rage had instantly descended over their eyes and all that remained visible was their unhinged hatred of Trump pinballing within their minds. No more thoughts about the poor; no more discussions about how said poor and working-class constituents could no longer afford the rising costs of food, rent, medicine, childcare or education. No more thoughts about an open border and how tens of millions of illegal migrants were siphoning off taxpayer dollars that could have dramatically helped those poor and working-class Americans; no more thoughts about rising violent crime, crumbling inner cities or failing public schools. Wait, what? Prior to Trump any of this mattered? Such concern is not in evidence. Convenient to blame the failure of the Democrat Party to win the latest presidential election as being solely about Trump breaking liberal Democrat brains. Definitely not about a concerted policy to avoid any material benefits for the working class; and there\u2019s overwhelming evidence of this. No, he is actually very smart.

Better yet would be a daily broadcast of some kind highlighting \u201cwhat DOGE did today.\u201d  Not only factual information, but interviews with workers and families publicizing the human cost to American citizens. This would be easy and cheap to produce and could become a great organizing tool if handled well. DOGE seems like it could be made very unpopular, and threaten to drag Trump down along with it.

Musk Is Positioned to Profit Off Billions in New Government Contracts (NY Times via archive.ph) The boost in federal spending for SpaceX will come in part as a result of actions by President Trump and Elon Musk\u2019s allies and employees who hold government positions.

I noticed earlier there\u2019s a post making the rounds either on Twitter or Reddit suggesting people sign up for a brokerage account at RobinHood or elsewhere and buy LEAP puts on Telsa to try to crash the stock. Wiser minds on Twitter pointed out that this is just gonna lose people buying puts money. Short interest and dealer delta hedging is complex enough, I don\u2019t entirely follow either the intended outcome or the actual mechanics as to why this will fail. Would need to study in greater detail. Being short stock in general is a tough way to make money. Stocks tend to go up over time. You have to be correct in both direction and time to not get smoked. Interesting attempt at financial warfare, though. Blunt force boycotts and campaigns might be the way for non-rich financial layfolk to go. Would be an interesting NC-post: \u201cBeginner\u00b4s Guide to Ruin Stock Companies\u201d. But then how to decide which are benign which are not.  As Brecht wrote in the Threepenny Opera:  \u201cWas ist ein Dietrich gegen eine Aktie? Was ist ein Einbruch in eine Bank gegen die Gr\u00fcndung einer Bank? Was ist die Ermordung eines Mannes gegen die Anstellung eines Mannes?\u201d \/ \u201cWhat is a lock pick compared to a stock? What is breaking into a bank compared to founding a bank? What is murdering a man compared to hiring a man?\u201d p.s. Or as they like to put it nowadays \u201cToday Brecht would be reading naked capitalism\u201d It might be easier to decide which are most malignant and target them first and worst.    Tesla ( and all other things Musk) are fulminant elonomas and should be deleted first and soonest. Killing Tesla may be the key to Musk\u2019s power.   Killing Tesla may start killing Musk\u2019s other businesses through a falling domino wave of rolling bankruptcies and liquidations.    Would that make DOGE weak enough for intestine-releasing flank attacks?    Worth trying and finding out.    The other silicon techbro companies are also very malignant and worthy of extinction.   Facebook, etc.     Amazon is like a huge mass of army ants crawling over the landscape.    But it would be much harder to kill.    Perhaps it can be shrunken down a little.    Perhaps another way to look at it is . . . which large and famous stock share companies are most fragile to pressure?   Which can be stock-price collapsed the deepest and hardest?   Which would have the most panic-run-inducing effect on the stock markets?    Which would terrorise the traditional overclass into deciding that Trump and DOGE have to be removed from office and from power with as much \u201cextreme prejudice\u201d as is required?    I suspect the big digital social media-tech companies are too big to kill.    Their users are too addicted to ever stop using.    But one thing their users COULD do is THIS . . . boycott every single company that advertises on any digitech company until no advertiser dares to advertise on any digitech company anywhere.    That would at least degrade and attrit their revenue streams, hence their stockshares, hence their power. Son of Zeitgeist Report. Spring is \u201cofficially\u201d here in the rancid underbelly of the North American Deep South. I was out back snipping off some spinach leaves for din dins and a ruby throated hummingbird mistook me for a plant and hovered right in front of my face, maybe two foot distance, for about ten seconds. It then slipped sideways and snapped up a flying insect, then another, and another. After that it was off to the azalea bushes on the side of the house, which are flowering, to search for nectar. I am heartened to see that Nature is doing its best to keep the World on an even keel. Stay safe and get outdoors for the Spring! Thank you for this lovely spring story, ambrit.  I had something similar happen to me years ago when I was standing within a foot of a hummer feeder I was getting ready to refill.  All of a sudden, a hummer came to the feeder and then came straight over to me. Within about 1-2 inches of my body, it helicoptered up and down my front while I watched in amazement.  I happened to be wearing a floral shirt which fooled the little guy for a few precious-to-me moments. It is amazing to experience. It reminded me that now was the time to wash out and refill the hummingbird feeders around the house, we have three at present. I have been lucky enough to hang a feeder on the front porch and have the birds become acostomed enough to my presence, sitting in the porch swing, that they will feed with me close by. Try it. It takes a week or two, but they will come to consider you a part of the scenery. Then watch them fight over the feeders! They chirp and do arial acrobatic \u201cfights\u201d to establish \u2018ownership\u2019 of the food sources. Keep watch and you will soon have their feeding times figured out. Sometimes, one or two will perch in a bush or tree nearby to keep an eye on \u201ctheir\u201d feeder. If I am \u201cpreaching to the choir,\u201d I beg your pardon. Stay safe. Keep watching the skies! That must have been an amazing experience and one that money cannot buy you. One for the deep memory files to be thought of from time to time. It truly is. It\u2019s up there with the time I inadvertently swam with a dolphin off of Miami Beach. It may not have mistaken you for a plant.    It may have considered you a very interesting large animal and was satisfying its curiosity.    Last year I was sitting in my tiny little yardlet ( yardette?) and a hummingbird flew to 3 feet away from the left side of my face and looked at me for several seconds, then flew to 3 feet away from the right side of my face and looked at me for several seconds, and then flew away.    It felt clear to me that it was looking \u201cat\u201d me and not as a plant. The Democrats Are Losing the Social Media Wars. This Young Socialist Is Changing That.

{"date":"2025-03-23","content":"ByBrett Owens  ByBrett Owens,  Contributor.  Mature businessman leading project meeting in office conference room When C-level types lay down five, six, even seven figures to scoop up shares, we listen (especially when we\u2019re looking at high-yield dividend stocks). After all, there is only one reason why executives buy their own stock. They believe the price is going up. Insider buying is a great cue. But it is important for us to understand what \u201csignal\u201d buys look like. Many executives have automatic buying programs, so like clockwork, we\u2019ll see them snap up a few thousand shares at, say, the start of every quarter. So what we really care about are sudden acquisitions across one or more insiders that fall well outside of their normal buying habits. These are the kind of insider purchases I want to share today. I have my eye on insider buys across four of Wall Street\u2019s top dividend payers\u2014companies throwing off anywhere between 5.4% and 9.9% on an annual basis. The simple fact that they\u2019re intentionally buying is reason enough to take a closer look\u2014but the fact that they\u2019re doing it amid a lot of Wall Street uncertainty makes them extremely interesting right now. Northern Oil & Gas (NOG)Dividend Yield: 6.0%Recent Noteworthy Buys: Minnesota-based Northern Oil and Gas (NOG) is an energy exploration and production company that owns some 300,000 acres of land across the Williston, Permian, Uinta and Appalachia basins. And it relies upon more than 100 public and private operators to extract oil and natural gas from those properties. Northern Oil and Gas tends to be an exaggerated play on the energy sector\u2014just look at the direction West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude is heading, and chances are NOG is sprinting even faster in the same direction. Still, the fact that NOG is off by nearly a third since early December seems a bit extreme given a lack of red-flag headlines. The company\u2019s Q3 results, released in November, beat expectations\u2014Q4, reported in March, didn\u2019t, but shares have rebounded softly since then. Wall Street also didn\u2019t flinch later in December amid reports that it was trying to acquire Granite Ridge Resources (GRNT). It\u2019s possible that investors have gone overboard in its selling, which might explain why several Northern Oil and Gas executives snapped up shares right around its early March earnings announcement. Bahram Akradi, NOG\u2019s board chair, bought more than $1.1 million worth of shares, while another director spent more than half a million, and its CEO bought around $70,000 worth. At the very least, they\u2019re getting paid well to hold those shares. Northern Oil and Gas has a fairly young dividend program that started in 2021. It paid 3 cents a share then, and 45 cents today\u2014for a comically tall 1,400% jump. That payout is still extremely well covered at roughly 40% of profits. NOG has done a good job of growing both organically and through acquisitions, which has resulted in substantial outperformance over the past few years. The recent swoon, while painful for current shareholders, has driven the headline yield up to 6% and has driven valuations down\u2014NOG trades for 7 times earnings estimates and at a low price\/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.56 (anything below 1 is considered to be undervalued). Sinclair (SBGI) Dividend Yield: 6.3%Recent Noteworthy Buys: Sinclair (SBGI), better known to some as Sinclair Broadcast Group, owns 185 owned or operated TV stations in 86 markets, as well as the Tennis Channel cable network. Sinclair has been dead money for more than a decade, with the exception of one short-lived pop in 2019. No surprise there. Americans are increasingly moving away from traditional television and toward streaming services, which leaves local TV on the outside looking in. Tennis viewership in the U.S. has been in a multidecade decline as well\u2014the 2025 Australian Open, for instance, saw an 11% decline year-over-year despite American Madison Keys\u2019 run to the title. None of that has stopped current Executive Chairman and former CEO David Smith from buying with both hands. In March, he spent more than $4 million adding to his pile of SBGI shares, which grew by about 50% in number\u2014he now owns 900,000 shares worth $14.4 million. Smith bought into a short-term dip that has SBGI shares throwing off more than 6% in yield. Past that, though, it\u2019s hard to see the appeal. The company\u2019s top and bottom lines are expected to retreat in 2025 following heavy campaign-ad spending last year. The stock isn\u2019t particularly cheap, at 22 times earnings estimates. And there are few catalysts on the horizon. Ready Capital (RC)Dividend Yield: 9.9%Recent Noteworthy Buys: Speaking of dip-buying, a whole squad of Ready Capital (RC) C-suiters has pounced on the stock\u2019s recent post-earnings dive. Ready Capital is a mortgage real estate investment trust (mREIT) that originates, acquires, finances and services small- and medium-sized balance commercial loans. A little more than 60% of its distributable earnings come from lower-middle-market loans, which includes construction, bridge, fixed-rate commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBSs) and Freddie Mac loans; the rest comes from government-backed small business and USDA loans. I mentioned a few months ago that the company had been cycling out of underperforming loans and into higher-yielding opportunities, and dumping its mortgage-servicing-rights (MSR) business while leaning into its small business lending platform\u2014but that \u201can eventual rebound could take some time.\u201d Well, it might need a bit longer. Why did shares fall off a cliff? In early March, Ready Capital announced downright dreadful Q4 results. The pros were looking for 19 cents in distributable earnings; RC lost 3 cents. Book value declined by nearly 16%. Portfolio credit quality improved but still remains worse than several peers. And RC announced it would cut the dividend in half, marking a 70% decline in payouts over the past three years. Management swooped in to support the stock, with six different executives combining to spend more than $700,000 on shares within about a week of Ready\u2019s disappointing report. And they\u2019ll collect nearly 10% annually even after the massive gut-shot to the dividend. But at least for right now, that might be RC\u2019s only appeal. NETSTREIT (NTST)Dividend Yield: 5.4%Recent Noteworthy Buys: It\u2019s hard not to swell with confidence when we see insiders buying an upswing in their stock. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen at NETSTREIT (NTST), a retail REIT that specializes in single-tenant net-lease deals. NTST breaks its retail properties into four categories, three of which involve heavily defensive tenants (percentages shown are % of annualized base rent): NTST Portfolio What the above doesn\u2019t show is that NETSTREIT is working on \u201cright-sizing\u201d exposure to some of its most outsized tenants, including Walgreens (WBA), Dollar General (DG), CVS (CVS), and Dollar Tree (DLTR). Specifically, it\u2019s trying to get all tenants to below 5% of ABR by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, net investment activity guidance was on the light side, and adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) guidance implies low-single-digit growth. In short: 2025 isn\u2019t setting up as a boom year, but instead a \u201cget our ducks in a row year\u201d\u2014hopefully one it can eventually build upon. NETSTREIT\u2019S CEO and CFO took turns buying in March while shares were rapidly bouncing off the bottom. Given that the stock still trades near the lower end of its five-year range, they might very well be buying a relative low. The 5%-plus yield isn\u2019t as glamorous as the other names mentioned here, but it\u2019s exceedingly well-covered, at just 65% of AFFO guidance.

Technically, it hasn't been formally announced yet, but it is already selling in stores in Bangladesh. Frankly, we can't say for sure whether it will get an official unveiling of any kind but in the meantime we have heard that it is already gearing up to make its way to Europe. This could be under the Poco C71 moniker, but regardless, it seems to be the same hardware.     Xiaomi Redmi A5 colors Some specs \"highlights\" include a 6.88-inch, 120Hz, 720p+ LCD rated for 1,500 nits of brightness, a Unisoc T7250 chipset alongside LPDDR4X RAM and eMMC 5.1 storage. In Bangladesh, the phone comes in two configurations - 4\/64GB for BDT 11,000 and 6\/128GB for BDT 13,000. Other specs include a 32MP main camera and an 8MP selfie. There is also a 5,200 mAh battery on board, with support for 18W charging. The Redmi A5 4G also has a side-mounted fingerprint reader, Bluetooth 5.2, a Type-C port and a 3.5mm audio jack, plus a microSD expansion slot. All of this is housed inside a 171.7 x 77.8 x 8.26mm, 193g body. The phone boots Android 15 Go edition.

The relationship between readers and publishers has grown fuzzy in the digital age, in ways we all understand by now, producing an audience that is less discerning and a media business that is less accountable.

A hand with an Apple Watch activates a Level Lock Plus on a wood door. Apple is working to add cameras to the Apple Watch in the next two years to enable artificial intelligence features such as Apple Intelligence, according to a report Sunday from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. The company is considering the addition of cameras to its standard Series smartwatches and Ultra models by 2027, according to Gurman, an Apple commentator with a reliable track record. The report comes as smartphone makers like Apple, Google and Samsung place a growing emphasis on AI features in their latest devices. \"The current idea is to put the camera inside the display of the Series version, like the front-facing lens on the iPhone,\" Gurman wrote in his weekly newsletter. The camera lens on the Ultra would have a slightly different placement, sitting on the side of the watch near the crown and button, he wrote. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Apple Intelligence, which debuted with the iOS 18.1 update in October, offers a visual search tool that can help identify objects and places around you and surface any relevant information.\u00a0   Gurman reported in December that Apple was exploring the possibility of adding temperature sensors and other physiological measurements to the AirPods. Both he and\u00a0Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo\u00a0also reported that Apple was working on\u00a0adding infrared cameras to future AirPods\u00a0by 2026. The IR cameras could be used in multiple ways.

Peter Kosminsky, who previously directed the first series of the award-winning adaptation of Hilary Mantel\u2019s bestselling novel about the life of King Henry VIII and his wives, told the BBC that almost all the exterior scenes in the second series were cut, and the show became instead \u201cconversations in rooms.\u201d  \tThe director explained to the BBC that other cuts had to be made too \u2013 costumes, props, locations \u2013 due to gaps in funding:  \t           \t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t        \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t \t              \tNews \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\t'Line Of Duty' Stars \"Commit To Season 7 Return In 2026\" - Report\t\t \t\t\t                \tLegal \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tRussell Brand Charged With Rape And Sexual Assault\t\t \t\t\t        \t\u201cWe had a whole joust, an extraordinary scene as conceived by Hilary Mantel, the original novelist \u2013 and we had to cut everything.  \t\u201cThat\u2019s not something that has ever happened to me before, in all the years I\u2019ve been making programmes, that you actually have to stop six weeks from production.\u201d  \tKosminsky previously shared that he, his lead actor Sir Mark Rylance and his screenwriter Peter Straughan (who won an Oscar this year for the screenplay for Conclave) also took significant pay cuts prior to filming to get the project across the line.  \tKosminsky, who has BAFTA and Golden Globe awards to his name, is calling for a 5% levy on UK subscription streaming revenues, with the proceeds collected for a British cultural fund.

Displaced residents have been forced to move into caravans and motels. Insurance claims are being processed to allow the damage to be repaired. In a town where the rental vacancy rate was already less than 1 per cent, the last thing locals needed was a destructive storm. But that is exactly what Mother Nature dished up to a small community in the NSW South West Slopes last month. Harden, north-west of Canberra and with a population of about 2,000, faced the brunt of a storm during the early hours of February 9. It caused severe flash flooding and left a dozen homes uninhabitable. Hilltops Council staff clearing the hail off the road, in the main street of Harden. (Supplied: Michelle Gallo) Local real estate agent Rosie Fairfield-Smith said every home in Harden had received some type of damage. Out of 150 rental properties on her agency's books, 12 are currently listed as uninhabitable due to damage, forcing occupants to live in motel rooms and caravans. \"There's basically nowhere for them to go because we are in a housing shortage at the moment, we don't have any rentals coming up,\" Ms Fairfield-Smith said. One of the residents affected was Jannine Vincent. She moved from the Illawarra after experiencing several flooding events, and chose Harden to start a new life. Three years later, her house and the adjoining clothing and accessories store were inundated by floodwater. Jannine Vincent moved from the Illawarra region to escape natural disasters.\u00a0 (ABC Riverina: Rachel Holdsworth) \"If I didn't have the videos and photos in my phone to look back at, I may have thought I dreamt it,\" Ms Vincent said. The line on the wall shows how high the floodwater had risen. (ABC Riverina: Rachel Holdsworth) A week after the storm, Ms Vincent moved to the local caravan park with her neighbour, who she did not know very well, because she was told by her landlord her home was deemed uninhabitable. \"It was a shock to the system; at no point did I think I would be moving anywhere anytime soon,\" she said. Ms Vincent was told she could stay in the caravan for six weeks. After three weeks of house hunting, Ms Vincent and her neighbour finally found a place outside of town. \"It's very hard to get anything on your own out here with my kind of budget, whereas we combine our forces, we get something a bit better,\" she said. Ms Fairfield-Smith said Harden, like many other communities, had traditionally low vacancy rates. Data from SQM Research shows the vacancy rate for postcode 2587 was sitting at 0.9 per cent in February There are currently no online rental listings for Harden on real estate websites realestate.com.au and domain.com.au Rosie Fairfield-Smith says the next few months will be long and arduous. (\u00a0Supplied: Rosie Fairfield-Smith\u00a0) \"Usually, we have basically a 0 per cent vacancy rate because rentals are so hard to come by that they just get filled up straight away,\" Ms Fairfield-Smith said. \"There probably could be more [cases] where tenants shouldn't be living in their properties but have nowhere else to go.\" Emergency services rescued one person from floodwaters in Harden when the wild thunderstorm swept through the town. (ABC Riverina: Rachel Holdsworth) Sarah Orr from insurance comparison website Compare the Market said people making a claim for storm damage should receive a response within 10 business days of submitting the evidence required. \"It is worth noting that in these big events, the insurers will be pulling out all of the stops to respond to claims quickly \u2026 to make sure they can get through large number of claims.\" Ms Orr said insurance companies were under increasing scrutiny about their response to weather events. \"Even if it may be delayed, you should expect a reasonably fast turnaround,\" she said.
