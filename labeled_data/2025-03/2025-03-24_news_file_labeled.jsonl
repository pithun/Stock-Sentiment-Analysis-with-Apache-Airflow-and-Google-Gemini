{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"\ufeffWhat if your 3D printer, Cricut, GlowForge, and iDraw were all the same machine? \ufeffWhat if your 3D printer, Cricut, GlowForge, and iDraw were all the same machine? by  Sean Hollister Last May, I told you how 3D printers still aren\u2019t easy enough for the mass market, but Bambu Lab had built the easiest yet. Now, instead of making it easier, Bambu is building its biggest and most sophisticated model to date \u2014 a Swiss Army knife of 3D printers that can also cut, draw, and etch. The new Bambu H2D, which starts at $1,899, has two 3D printing nozzles and a much bigger bed, but it also comes with a modular attachment system. Plug in a blade, and it dices through paper and vinyl. Plug in a pen, and it\u2019ll draw logos or schematics in a flash. You can even engrave and burn laser images into all sorts of materials.  With 10-watt and 40-watt lasers, I carved out a wooden Pok\u00e9mon stencil for my daughter, then turned one of her other drawings into a custom cork drink coaster. (See my embedded video!) First, Bambu\u2019s laser gently etched the surface, then it cut out a coaster, all with one operation. I even managed to engrave a set of Apple AirTags, though I did burn one of their plastic shells trying to dial in the right settings.  Sure, you can already do these things with individual tools, and there are a handful of machines on the market that combine 3D printing, laser cutting, and CNC routing into one device. But now, Bambu is about to muscle in on Cricut, GlowForge and iDraw\u2019s turf with one machine to rule the prosumer hobbyist market. Or at least that\u2019s the idea. Fundamentally, the H2D works the same way as Bambu\u2019s original printers: it has a robot gantry that moves left, right, forward and back at high speed, while a bed slowly lowers to let your print get taller as you go. (Specifically, it\u2019s a CoreXY system.) But now, that robot gantry houses two alternating nozzles, a quick-release mount and dedicated power connector for other tools. It makes sense: kind of like how a KitchenAid stand mixer also lets you use its rotary power to optionally spin a pasta maker or vegetable slicer attachment, why not use a 3D printer\u2019s precise 3D motions to move pens, blades and lasers, too? But those are optional, so let\u2019s talk 3D printing first. You can print things fully twice as large as Bambu\u2019s original X1 and P1 series printers (by volume) inside its 350 x 320 x 325mm build area, and the twin nozzles mean you can print in two different materials without constantly changing between those filaments and wasting some every time you do. One of Bambu\u2019s go-to examples is an entire bicycle helmet including its padding, that you can print at once, with a strong carbon-fiber laced PETG outer shell mated to a soft TPU cushion.  Like last year\u2019s Bambu A1 and A1 Mini, the H2D inherits easy toolless nozzle swaps, only now with nozzles designed to go up to 350 degrees Celsius and optional high-flow ones. Only the right nozzle supports TPU, but each can be connected to its own optional AMS to automatically retract and load different kinds of filament, and Bambu\u2019s desktop app can now even tell you which rolls should go with which nozzles to minimize waste. Speaking of AMS, the optional new four-color AMS 2 Pro, or single-color AMS HT, now have built-in heaters and electromagnetically opening and closing vents so they can dry filament too (important because many 3D printing materials absorb troublesome moisture). The AMS HT goes up to 85 degrees Celsius, the AMS 2 Pro up to 65 degrees. The printer has autonomous vents, too, so you don\u2019t need to open the door or remove the lid to ensure soft plastics don\u2019t warp. And it has its own 65-degree chamber heater to keep things toasty for filaments. Everywhere I look, there are potential improvements, from a new, seemingly community-inspired dual wiper system for the nozzles, to the way its tubing is easier to connect and feeds slightly more reliably than before.  And that\u2019s before you opt for the laser specific parts, including a set of green-tinted laser safety windows, additional cameras and flame sensors, and a big red button you can slam to quickly turn the whole thing off. I was apprehensive about heating flammable materials inside a 3D printer, especially once the printer\u2019s touchscreen had me walk through its \u201cLaser Terms and Conditions,\u201d but I\u2019ve yet to see any flame. After seeing how the printer\u2019s own jet of air, fans, and optional fume extractor handled the heat during my first few laser operations, I feel reasonably confident.  I just don\u2019t know how often I\u2019d want to use a laser inside my 3D printer, and the laser left a burning smell in my garage for days even with the fume extractor at max. Plus, you (understandably) can\u2019t start a laser or slicing operation remotely: as a precaution, Bambu makes you press a physical button on the printer and advises you to stick around. Thankfully, laser operations are much quicker than 3D printing, measured in seconds and minutes instead of hours and days. Bambu Suite is the new desktop app for laser, blade, and pen operations, and it\u2019s a little barebones today. While you should be able to load and print community designs starting in April, the version I tried was limited to basic preset shapes, text, curved lines, QR codes, and images. You can adjust speed, laser strength or blade\/pen pressure, have the printer take a photo of your materials on the bed, then overlay your project atop that photo before pressing print. Even though I\u2019ve had an H2D for about a month, I won\u2019t be reviewing it anytime soon. That\u2019s partly because there\u2019s just so very many functions to test, but also partly because I want to give it some more time in the oven: like most 3D printers, it seems Bambu sent this one to reviewers before its functions are fully dialed in. While Bambu\u2019s touchscreen and software does a wonderful job easing newcomers into printing, cutting, and etching, and it\u2019s got more cameras and algorithms than ever before (including LIDAR, timelapse, a new nozzle camera and a bird\u2019s eye camera too), I\u2019m actually finding its basic 3D printing modes aren\u2019t as reliable yet as other printers I\u2019ve used.  Bambu actually sent me a whole new printer after the first one failed tests that cheaper 3D printers easily passed; my second printer is doing far better, but I\u2019m still getting better quality out of my old P1P. Plus, the H2D\u2019s dual-nozzle feature isn\u2019t working reliably for me. I did finish Bambu\u2019s bicycle helmet after a nearly three-day print, but I won\u2019t be able to wear it, given all the unsightly bits of carbon-fiber laced PETG sticking out and the conspicuous gaps in its TPU padding.  Here\u2019s hoping that\u2019s just growing pains. At the least, I\u2019d go watch reviews from other, more experienced 3D printing enthusiasts before buying this machine. The Bambu H2D starts at $1,899 with preorders starting in June. A $2,799 H2D combo with a 10W laser is available for pre-order today and ships at the end of April. An H2D AMS combo, meanwhile, includes the AMS 2 Pro, build plate, spool holder and accessory box. That\u2019s in stock and available to order now. Finally, there\u2019s a $3,499 H2D Laser Full Combo package with a 40-watt laser, cutting module, laser platform, cutting platform and emergency stop button. Pre-orders for that begin today and it ships at the end of April.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"Supermarket chain Morrisons is to shut 52 cafes and 17 convenience stores, putting hundreds of jobs at risk. The retailer will also close a number of in-store services, including some meat and fish counters, pharmacies and all its market kitchens in an attempt to redirect cash to other parts of the business. It is expected the cuts will be rolled out over the next few months. The retailer has come under significant pressure from the growth of discounter rivals, with Aldi overtaking Morrisons as the UK's fourth biggest supermarket chain in 2022. Morrisons said most staff affected by the changes were expected to be redeployed, but around 365 employees would be at risk of redundancy.  The store closures will all be Morrisons Daily convenience stores, which have extended opening hours. The other closures include 52 cafes,13 florists, 35 meat counters, 35 fish counters, four pharmacies and all 18 market kitchens, which are small food courts that offer freshly made meals to take away. The chain employs 95,000 people in its 500 supermarkets and 1,600 Morrisons Dailys. In-store cafes will be shut in five London stores, with cafes in Leeds, Portsmouth and Glasgow also affected. In some stores, the supermarket plans to work with third parties \"to provide a relevant specialist offer\", said chief executive Rami Baiti\u00e9h. \"The changes we are announcing today are a necessary part of our plans to renew and reinvigorate Morrisons and enable us to focus our investment into the areas that customers really value and that can play a full part in our growth.\" In January, rival Sainsbury's announced it was shutting down the remainder of its cafes, saying that most shoppers \"do not use the cafes regularly\". Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Morrisons was going to have to make adjustments to be able to compete in a price-sensitive market.  \"The supermarket chain is closing services seen as nice-to-have, but not essential, and scaling back its convenience footprint as it readies for a round of cost-cutting from rivals,\" she said. \"Discounters Aldi and Lidl are already proving to be formidable competition. Morrison's clearly wants to free up cash to be as value-focused as possible as an intense period of competition is forecast.\"  Cafes: Morrisons Daily convenience stores: A grandmother explains how her first thought on hearing the news is \"oh no, how will I tell him\"? The supermarket chain follows other major retailers in raising pay Asda plans to spend more on reducing prices and improving product ranges for customers, but says its profits will suffer. The woman, in her 60s, was found unconscious at her home by the Asda driver. Giving away food will be trialled in some Express stores in an effort to cut waste. Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"Senior Correspondent A US flag flies near containers stacked high on a cargo ship at the Port of Los  Angeles  Senior Correspondent In his forty-plus years in the textile industry, Larry Severini has seen hundreds of factories close, as companies moved women\u2019s wear and home furnishings and then other textile manufacturing overseas.  But Severeni was able to maintain two factories that make the blue backgrounds and white stars for American flags\u2014until January 31, 2025. On that day, he closed his factory in Gaffney, S.C., for good, getting rid of millions of dollars of machinery and laying off dozens of workers, some of whom had been laboring there for decades.\u00a0 Advertisement Advertisement \u201cPeople are buying flags from China at an artificially low price that we can\u2019t compete with,\u201d says Severini, who still has one factory open, in Kingstree, S.C., which makes star fields for the flag and other textiles.\u00a0 It may sound strange to hear of a manufacturing company closing right now. In the second Trump Administration, the President has promised\u2014and levied\u2014tariffs on countries including China, Canada, and Mexico in an effort to boost American manufacturing. Trump also levied tariffs on Chinese goods in his first term that the Biden Administration maintained. \u201cThis administration is leaving 40 years of failed industrial policy behind and bringing American manufacturing BACK!\u201d Vice President JD Vance wrote on X \u00a0recently.\u00a0 But despite the bravado, many of those working in the textile industry say conditions are tougher than ever, with 27 textile factories shuttering in the last 20 months, according to Kim Glas, president and CEO of the National Council of Textile Organizations, a lobbying group.\u00a0 They blame a once-obscure trade provision, called de minimis, which has been thrust into the spotlight in recent months. President Trump ended de minimis in a February executive order before reversing himself days later as chaos ensued. The White House said de minimis would resume when \u201cadequate systems are in place\u201d to deal with the shipments.\u00a0 Created by Congress in 1938, de minimis allows people to import packages worth less than $800 without paying tariffs on those packages or going through formal customs paperwork. It was created as a nod to consumer fairness: travelers were able to bring back a certain amount of goods from overseas without paying customs on those goods, supporters reasoned, so people who couldn\u2019t travel should have the same privilege. In 2016, Congress raised the threshold from $200 to $800. Retailers like Severini say that the de minimis provision allows Chinese factories to send cheap goods, such as American flags, to the U.S. without the same tariffs that they would have to pay to send the same product to China. Severini says he suspects that sellers on e-commerce websites like Amazon order large quantities of American flags, avoid paying tariffs on them through de minimis, and then sell them online, sometimes labeling them as made in the U.S.A.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s a major hurdle that our industry really needs some breathing room from,\u201d he says.\u00a0 There are a huge number of goods that come into the country under de minimis. In 2023 alone, the U.S. saw $54.5 billion worth of de minimis imports, or about 1 billion total shipments, up from $0.05 billion, or 110 million shipments, in 2012. About 30% of de minimis shipments are goods that Americans buy on sites like Shein and Temu.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a free trade agreement for China and the rest of the world,\u201d says Glas, of NCTO.\u00a0 Ironically, there\u2019s evidence that Trump\u2019s first-term trade war was what helped expand de minimis shipping. After the U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, Chinese exporters looked for new ways to ship things to the U.S. and avoid tariffs, and landed on de minimis.\u00a0 Whether ending de minimis could really jumpstart industries like textiles is up for debate. Most of the goods that people buy through de minimis are inexpensive, and so a 25% or even 40% tariff wouldn\u2019t raise the cost of it very much. There are American flags listed on Temu, for example, for less than $3.\u00a0 Avoiding de minimis saves importers money in other ways, says Amit Khandelwal, a Yale economics professor who recently co-authored a paper on what would happen if de minimis went away. Importers who don\u2019t have the benefit of de minimis have to go through customs paperwork and logistics challenges that can increase the price of a package by as much as $20 apiece, which significantly raises costs.\u00a0 Still, because of the cost of labor and materials overseas, Chinese and other manufacturers may still be able to make cheaper goods than those made in the U.S., Khandelwal says. \u201cDomestic producers claim they will benefit from the end of de minimis,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure.\u201d\u00a0 In his research, Khandelwal also found that consumers who live in lower-income zip codes and those with higher shares of minorities disproportionately benefit from de minimis. They\u2019re more likely to shop at sites like Temu and Shein and to buy goods that have come into the country under the provision. \u201cIf you remove de minimis, it\u2019s going to look like a regressive tax,\u201d says Khandelwal, meaning that it hurts lower-income people the most. Severini argues that these people are getting goods at an artificially low price. After all, countries like Mexico and China have much lower de minimis limits, he says. He hopes that Congress will get rid of the loophole entirely, which looks increasingly likely to some observers.\u00a0 Doing so, Severini says, would help get his Kingstree factory back up to three shifts a day, which it was running before the pandemic\u2014and before de minimis shipments started taking off. Workers in the factory make $16 an hour plus performance incentives, Severini says. One of his former workers laid off from the Gaffney did find a job, he adds\u2014at an e-commerce warehouse helping sort goods that come in from overseas.  \u00a9 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"What happens when quantum computers can finally crack encryption and break into the world\u2019s best-kept secrets? It\u2019s called Q-Day\u2014the worst holiday maybe ever. One day soon, at a research lab near Santa Barbara or Seattle or a secret facility in the Chinese mountains, it will begin: the sudden unlocking of the world\u2019s secrets. Your secrets. Cybersecurity analysts call this Q-Day\u2014the day someone builds a quantum computer that can crack the most widely used forms of encryption. These math problems have kept humanity\u2019s intimate data safe for decades, but on Q-Day, everything could become vulnerable, for everyone: emails, text messages, anonymous posts, location histories, bitcoin wallets, police reports, hospital records, power stations, the entire global financial system. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of playing Russian roulette,\u201d says Michele Mosca, who coauthored the most recent \u201cQuantum Threat Timeline\u201d report from the Global Risk Institute, which estimates how long we have left. \u201cYou\u2019ll probably win if you only play once, but it\u2019s not a good game to play.\u201d When Mosca and his colleagues surveyed cybersecurity experts last year, the forecast was sobering: a one-in-three chance that Q-Day happens before 2035. And the chances it has already happened in secret? Some people I spoke to estimated 15 percent\u2014about the same as you\u2019d get from one spin of the revolver cylinder. The corporate AI wars may have stolen headlines in recent years, but the quantum arms race has been heating up too. Where today\u2019s AI pushes the limits of classical computing\u2014the kind that runs on 0s and 1s\u2014quantum technology represents an altogether different form of computing. By harnessing the spooky mechanics of the subatomic world, it can run on 0s, 1s, or anything in between. This makes quantum computers pretty terrible at, say, storing data but potentially very good at, say, finding the recipe for a futuristic new material (or your email password). The classical machine is doomed to a life of stepwise calculation: Try one set of ingredients, fail, scrap everything, try again. But quantum computers can explore many potential recipes simultaneously.  So, naturally, tech giants such as Google, Huawei, IBM, and Microsoft have been chasing quantum\u2019s myriad positive applications\u2014not only for materials science but also communications, drug development, and market analysis. China is plowing vast resources into state-backed efforts, and both the US and the European Union have pledged millions in funding to support homegrown quantum industries. Of course, whoever wins the race won\u2019t just have the next great engine of world-saving innovation. They\u2019ll also have the greatest code-breaking machine in history. So it\u2019s normal to wonder: What kind of Q-Day will humanity get\u2014and is there anything we can do to prepare? If you had a universal picklock, you might tell everyone\u2014or you might keep it hidden in your pocket for as long as you possibly could. From a typical person\u2019s vantage point, maybe Q-Day wouldn\u2019t be recognizable as Q-Day at all. Maybe it would look like a series of strange and apparently unconnected news stories spread out over months or years. London\u2019s energy grid goes down on election day, plunging the city into darkness. A US submarine on a covert mission surfaces to find itself surrounded by enemy ships. Embarrassing material starts to show up online in greater and greater quantities: classified intelligence cables, presidential cover-ups, billionaires\u2019 dick pics. In this scenario, it might be decades before we\u2019re able to pin down exactly when Q-Day actually happened. Then again, maybe the holder of the universal picklock prefers the disaster-movie outcome: everything, everywhere, all at once. Destroy the grid. Disable the missile silos. Take down the banking system. Open all the doors and let the secrets out. Suppose you ask a classical computer to solve a simple math problem: Break the number 15 into its smallest prime factors. The computer would try all the options one by one and give you a near-instantaneous answer: 3 and 5. If you then ask the computer to factor a number with 1,000 digits, it would tackle the problem in exactly the same way\u2014but the calculation would take millennia. This is the key to a lot of modern cryptography. Take RSA encryption, developed in the late 1970s and still used for securing email, websites, and much more. In RSA, you (or your encrypted messaging app of choice) create a private key, which consists of two or more large prime numbers. Those numbers, multiplied together, form part of your public key. When someone wants to send you a message, they use your public key to encrypt it. You\u2019re the only person who knows the original prime numbers, so you\u2019re the only person who can decrypt it. Until, that is, someone else builds a quantum computer that can use its spooky powers of parallel computation to derive the private key from the public one\u2014not in millennia but in minutes. Then the whole system collapses. The algorithm to do this already exists. In 1994, decades before anyone had built a real quantum computer, an AT&T Bell Labs researcher named Peter Shor designed the killer Q-Day app. Shor\u2019s algorithm takes advantage of the fact that quantum computers run not on bits but on qubits. Rather than being locked in a state of 0 or 1, they can exist as both simultaneously\u2014in superposition. When you run an operation on a handful of qubits in a given quantum state, you\u2019re actually running that same operation on those same qubits in all their potential quantum states. With qubits, you\u2019re not confined to trial and error. A quantum computer can explore all potential solutions simultaneously. You\u2019re calculating probability distributions, waves of quantum feedback that pile onto each other and peak at the correct answer. With Shor\u2019s algorithm, carefully designed to amplify certain mathematical patterns, that\u2019s exactly what happens: Large numbers go in one end, factors come out the other. In theory, at least. Qubits are incredibly difficult to build in real life, because the slightest environmental interference can nudge them out of the delicate state of superposition, where they balance like a spinning coin. But Shor\u2019s algorithm ignited interest in the field, and by the 2010s, a number of projects were starting to make progress on building the first qubits. In 2016, perhaps sensing the nascent threat of Q-Day, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) launched a competition to develop quantum-proof encryption algorithms. These largely work by presenting quantum computers with complex multidimensional mazes, called structured lattices, that even they can\u2019t navigate without directions. In 2019, Google\u2019s quantum lab in Santa Barbara claimed that it had achieved \u201cquantum supremacy.\u201d Its 53-qubit chip could complete in just 200 seconds a task that would have taken 100,000 conventional computers about 10,000 years. Google\u2019s latest quantum processor, Willow, has 105 qubits. But to break encryption with Shor\u2019s algorithm, a quantum computer will need thousands or even millions. There are now hundreds of companies trying to build quantum computers using wildly different methods, all geared toward keeping qubits isolated from the environment and under control: superconducting circuits, trapped ions, molecular magnets, carbon nanospheres. While progress on hardware inches forward, computer scientists are refining quantum algorithms, trying to reduce the number of qubits required to run them. Each step brings Q-Day closer. That\u2019s bad news not just for RSA but also for a dizzying array of other systems that will be vulnerable on Q-Day. Security consultant Roger A. Grimes lists some of them in his book Cryptography Apocalypse: the DSA encryption used by many US government agencies until recently, the elliptic-curve cryptography used to secure cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, the VPNs that let political activists and porn aficionados browse the web in secrecy, the random number generators that power online casinos, the smartcards that let you tap through locked doors at work, the security on your home Wi-Fi network, the two-factor authentication you use to log in to your email account. Experts from one national security agency told me they break the resulting threats down into two broad areas: confidentiality and authentication. In other words, keeping secrets and controlling access to critical systems. Chris Demchak, a former US Army officer who is a professor of cybersecurity at the US Naval War College and spoke with me in a personal capacity, says that a Q-Day computer could let an adversary eavesdrop on classified military data in real time. \u201cIt would be very bad if they knew exactly where all of our submarines were,\u201d Demchak says. \u201cIt would be very bad if they knew exactly what our satellites are looking at. And it would be very bad if they knew exactly how many missiles we had and their range.\u201d The balance of geopolitical power in, say, the Taiwan Strait could quickly tilt. Beyond that real-time threat to confidentiality, there\u2019s also the prospect of \u201charvest now, decrypt later\u201d attacks. Hackers aligned with the Chinese state have reportedly been hoovering up encrypted data for years in hopes of one day having a quantum computer that can crack it. \u201cThey wolf up everything,\u201d Demchak told me. (The US almost certainly does this too.) The question then becomes: How long will your sensitive data remain valuable? \u201cThere might be some needles in that haystack,\u201d says Brian Mullins, the CEO of Mind Foundry, which helps companies implement quantum technology. Your current credit card details might be irrelevant in 10 years, but your fingerprint won\u2019t be. A list of intelligence assets from the end of the Iraq War might seem useless until one of those assets becomes a prominent politician. The threat to authentication may be even scarier. \u201cPretty much anything that says a person is who they say they are is underpinned by encryption,\u201d says Deborah Frincke, a computer scientist and national security expert at Sandia National Laboratories. \u201cSome of the most sensitive and valuable infrastructure that we have would be open to somebody coming in and pretending to be the rightful owner and issuing some kind of command: to shut down a network, to influence the energy grid, to create financial disruption by shutting down the stock market.\u201d The exact level of Q-Day chaos will depend on who has access to the first cryptographically relevant quantum computers. If it\u2019s the United States, there will be a \u201cfierce debate\u201d at the highest levels of government, Demchak believes, over whether to release it for scientific purposes or keep it secret and use it for intelligence. \u201cIf a private company gets there first, the US will buy it and the Chinese will try to hack it,\u201d she claims. If it\u2019s one of the US tech companies, the government could put it under the strict export controls that now apply to AI chips. Most nation-state attacks are on private companies\u2014say, someone trying to break into a defense contractor like Lockheed Martin and steal plans for a next-generation fighter jet. But over time, as quantum computers become more widely available, the focus of the attacks could broaden. The likes of Microsoft and Amazon are already offering researchers access to their primitive quantum devices on the cloud\u2014and big tech companies haven\u2019t always been great at policing who uses their platforms. (The soldier who blew up a Cybertruck outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas early this year queried ChatGPT to help plan the attack.) You could have a bizarre scenario where a cybercriminal uses Amazon\u2019s cloud quantum computing platform to break into Amazon Web Services. Cybercriminals with access to a quantum computer could use it to go after the same targets more effectively, or take bigger swings: hijacking the SWIFT international payments system to redirect money transfers, or conducting corporate espionage to collect kompromat. The earliest quantum computers probably won\u2019t be able to run Shor\u2019s algorithm that quickly\u2014they might only get one or two keys a day. But combining a quantum computer with an artificial intelligence that can map out an organization\u2019s weakness and highlight which keys to decrypt to cause the most damage could yield devastating results. And then there\u2019s Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is exquisitely vulnerable to Q-Day. Because each block in the Bitcoin blockchain captures the data from the previous block, Bitcoin cannot be upgraded to post-quantum cryptography, according to Kapil Dhiman, CEO of Quranium, a post-quantum blockchain security company. \u201cThe only solution to that seems to be a hard fork\u2014give birth to a new chain and the old chain dies.\u201d But that would require a massive organizational effort. First, 51 percent of Bitcoin node operators would have to agree. Then everyone who holds bitcoin would have to manually move their funds from the old chain to the new one (including the elusive Satoshi Nakamoto, the Bitcoin developer who controls wallets containing around $100 billion of the cryptocurrency). If Q-Day happens before the hard fork, there\u2019s nothing to stop bitcoin going to zero. \u201cIt\u2019s like a time bomb,\u201d says Dhiman. That bomb going off will only be the beginning. When Q-Day becomes public knowledge, either via grim governmental address or cheery big-tech press release, the world will enter the post-quantum age. It will be an era defined by mistrust and panic\u2014the end of digital security as we know it. \u201cAnd then the scramble begins,\u201d says Demchak. All confidence in the confidentiality of our communications will collapse. Of course, it\u2019s unlikely that everyone\u2019s messages will actually be targeted, but the perception that you could be spied on at any time will change the way we live. And if NIST\u2019s quantum-proof algorithms haven\u2019t rolled out to your devices by that point, you face a real problem\u2014because any attempts to install updates over the cloud will also be suspect. What if that download from Apple isn\u2019t actually from Apple? Can you trust the instructions telling you to transfer your crypto to a new quantum-secure wallet? Grimes, the author of Cryptography Apocalypse, predicts enormous disruptions. We might have to revert to Cold War methods of transmitting sensitive data. (It\u2019s rumored that after a major hack in 2011, one contractor purportedly asked its staff to stop using email for six weeks.) Fill a hard drive, lock it in a briefcase, put someone you trust on a plane with the payload handcuffed to their wrist. Or use one-time pads\u2014books of pre-agreed codes to encrypt and decrypt messages. Quantum-secure, but not very scalable. Expect major industries\u2014energy, finance, health care, manufacturing, transportation\u2014to slow to a crawl as companies with sensitive data switch to paper-based methods of doing business and scramble to hire expensive cryptography consultants. There will be a spike in inflation. Most people might just accept the inevitable: a post-privacy society in which any expectation of secrecy evaporates unless you\u2019re talking to someone in person in a secluded area with your phones switched off. Big Quantum is Watching You. The best-case scenario looks something like Y2K, where we have a collective panic, make the necessary upgrades to encryption, and by the time Q-Day rolls around it\u2019s such an anticlimax that it becomes a joke. That outcome may still be possible. Last summer, NIST released its first set of post-quantum encryption standards. One of Joe Biden\u2019s last acts as president was to sign an executive order changing the deadline for government agencies to implement NIST\u2019s algorithms from 2035 to \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d Already, NIST\u2019s post-quantum cryptography has been rolled out on messaging platforms such as Signal and iMessage. Sources told me that sensitive national security data is probably being locked up in ways that are quantum-secure. But while your email account can easily be Q-proofed over the internet (assuming the update doesn\u2019t come from a quantum imposter!), other things can\u2019t. Public bodies like the UK\u2019s National Health Service are still using hardware and software from the 1990s. \u201cMicrosoft is not going to upgrade some of its oldest operating systems to be post-quantum secure,\u201d says Ali El Kaafarani, the CEO of PQShield, a company that makes quantum-resistant hardware. Updates to physical infrastructure can take decades, and some of that infrastructure has vulnerable cryptography in places it can\u2019t be changed: The energy grid, military hardware, and satellites could all be at risk. And there\u2019s a balance to be struck. Rushing the transition risks introducing vulnerabilities that weren\u2019t there before. \u201cHow do you make transitions slow enough that you can be confident and fast enough that you don\u2019t dawdle?\u201d asks Chris Ballance, CEO of Oxford Ionics, a quantum computing company. Some of those vulnerabilities might even be there by design: Memos leaked by Edward Snowden indicate that the NSA may have inserted a backdoor into a pseudorandom number generator that was adopted by NIST in 2006. \u201cAnytime anybody says you should use this particular algorithm and there\u2019s a nation-state behind it, you\u2019ve got to wonder whether there\u2019s a vested interest,\u201d says Rob Young, director of Lancaster University\u2019s Quantum Technology Centre. Then again, several people I spoke to pointed out that any nation-state with the financial muscle and technical knowledge to build a quantum device that can run Shor\u2019s algorithm could just as easily compromise the financial system, the energy grid, or an enemy\u2019s security apparatus through conventional methods. Why invent a new computing paradigm when you can just bribe a janitor? Long before quantum technology is good enough to break encryption, it will be commercially and scientifically useful enough to tilt the global balance. As researchers solve the engineering challenge of isolating qubits from the environment, they\u2019ll develop exquisitely sensitive quantum sensors that will be able to unmask stealth ships and map hidden bunkers, or give us new insight into the human body. Similarly, pharma companies of the future could use quantum to steal a rival\u2019s inventions\u2014or use it to dream up even better ones. So ultimately the best way to stave off Q-Day may be to share those benefits around: Take the better batteries, the miracle drugs, the far-sighted climate forecasting, and use them to build a quantum utopia of new materials and better lives for everyone.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"Business Insider Edition  Good morning. Baby boomers' hopes for a comfortable retirement could be at risk if the stock market keeps falling. Financial experts shared key strategies with BI to help protect their savings.          In today's big story, female executives are fed up with alpha male CEOs acting like \"billionaire boys in the sandbox.\" Now, they're fighting back.       What's on deck   Markets: Faith-based investing is having a moment. (And we don't mean confidence.)       Tech: Cybersecurity researchers are role-playing with ChatGPT.       Business: The rich are taking to the skies for their commutes \u2014 Ubers be damned.               But first, deprogramming the bro-code.       If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.   Lately, boardrooms are brimming with the bro-ish bravado you'd expect to find in a locker room.           A buff Mark Zuckerberg wants Meta to celebrate a culture of \"aggression.\" He also likes martial arts and butchering his own meat. 200 push-ups while wearing a weighted vest? No problem.               Jeff Bezos (also now buff) laid down the hammer at The Washington Post, demanding editors give him a \"hell yes\" to affirm they're all in on \"personal liberties and free markets.\"               Let's not forget Elon Musk, who over the last several years, has been challenging anyone from Zuckerberg to Vladimir Putin to single combat.       Not in the least surprised by all this chest-thumping: women in business.           The return of the alpha male CEO has engendered a new opponent, BI's Amanda Hoover writes. Female executives are fed up with the \"billionaire boys in the sandbox,\" as one sociologist put it \u2014 and instead of waiting to be let in, some are building their own arenas.               Fabrik founder Jaclyn Pascocello told BI that she is seeing a collective of women coming together and starting to build companies to address issues sometimes ignored by men.               When companies won't offer the flexibility that working parents need, it can embolden people to become more entrepreneurial and build under their own terms. \"Oftentimes the easiest way to find that is to build it yourself,\" Pascocello said.               Amanda spoke with female founders, psychologists, and sociologists about the resurgent machoism in corporate America \u2014 and how female executives are fighting back.       1. Praying for returns? Look no further than religious ETFs. Faith-based investments are a small part of the ETF world, but rising religious fervor and President Trump's leadership are driving interest. However, these funds can be picky about what to include.       2. President Trump could be making the same mistake as Biden. Trump's economic policies have some worried about a potential recession, and the stock market has taken a hit. With the 2026 midterms not far off, Trump risks political damage by continuing to ignore the elephant in the room.       3. Has bitcoin already peaked this year? Betting markets seem to think so. They expect the cryptocurrency to reach $110,000, barely above its record price. Wall Street bulls beg to differ.       1. Jensen made a joke, but who's laughing? At Nvidia's big AI conference, CEO Jensen Huang joked that new Blackwell GPUs would render the company's older chip models obsolete. Its cloud giant customers might not find that very funny, though, since it would cost them billions.       2. You can get ChatGPT to make password-stealing malware. Just play pretend. Researchers cracked some LLMs' security features to generate code that could breach Google's password manager. The key? Make the chatbot pretend to be a superhero.       3. A former Point72 exec's new data startup wants to level the playing field. Kirk McKeown's Carbon Arc allows small funds and businesses to purchase private data by the megabyte \u2014 sometimes for less than $1. The startup's goal is to make it more accessible for anyone looking to trade or feed AI models.       1. Out: Ubering. In: Blading. The wealthy are ditching hired cars for helicopter services like Blade, where a nine-minute ride from Manhattan to JFK airport starts at $95. When a rush-hour Uber in the city can cost more than $100, that sounds like a deal.       2. Law firms split over Trump's attack. Elias Law Group rebuked Trump's Friday memo that warned firms against frivolous suits against his administration. Marc Elias said in a statement on Saturday that there would be no negotiation about the clients his firm represents. Meanwhile, after Paul Weiss struck a deal with Trump on Friday, its chairman, Brad Karp, sent an email to staff addressing their unease over the decision.       3. Freebies for federal workers. DC businesses are offering perks like free workout classes and financial planning sessions to federal employees as they navigate the uncertainty around their jobs. BI heard from five businesses on why they're stepping up.       The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave).

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"Business Insider Edition  Some people are horse girls, but I proudly refer to myself as a Costco girl. I grew up going to the store with my mom in the early 2000s and loved snacking on the free samples.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"\u200bRecent data indicates that prices for Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5090 graphics card are gradually stabilizing, though they remain significantly above the manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail price (MSRP). A Reddit user compiled eBay sales data, revealing that average selling prices have decreased from around $6,000 at launch to approximately $4,000 in recent weeks. The RTX 5090, part of Nvidia\u2019s latest Blackwell series, has faced severe supply shortages since its release, leading to inflated prices on secondary markets. Initial listings on platforms like eBay saw prices reaching up to $10,000, far exceeding the MSRP. This scarcity has been reminiscent of previous GPU shortages, where high demand and limited supply led to significant price hikes.\u200b The compiled data shows a downward trend in pricing since the launch, with average selling prices of completed eBay listings dropping from $6,000 to $4,000. In the week following the launch, RTX 5090 prices ranged from as low as MSRP to as high as $10,000. From January 30 to March 21, the standard deviation, indicating variation from the mean, was $1,121.98. Limiting the scope to March, the standard deviation sharply declined to $145.60, suggesting increased market stability and more consistent pricing among resellers. Nvidia has acknowledged the supply challenges and is said to be working to improve stock levels for the RTX 50-series GPUs. The company anticipates that as availability increases, prices will stabilize closer to the MSRP. Nvidia is collaborating with its partners to enhance supply chains and meet consumer demand more effectively. \u200b In Europe, Nvidia has reduced the prices of its RTX 50-series GPUs by nearly five percent, attributed to a stronger Euro against the dollar. For instance, the RTX 5090 has dropped by more than four percent to \u20ac2,229. However, stock availability remains limited, making it challenging for consumers to purchase these GPUs at the adjusted prices. \u200b Despite these efforts, the RTX 5090 continues to be scarce, and prices remain above the MSRP. Consumers are advised to monitor official retail channels for restocks and avoid purchasing from scalpers to prevent overpaying. As Nvidia and its partners work to improve supply, prices are expected to continue their gradual decline toward stabilization. While trying to get its Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card more solidly on the market, the component manufacturer and its retail partners have bumped into some functionality issues with the GPU that affect its performance. Several users have obtained the RTX 5090 GPU from multiple different retailers, and have reported a unique problem, where the GPU does not have as many ROPs (Raster Operations Pipeline unit) as it should to sufficiently render images in 3D post-processing. As a huge GPU enthusiast, a new launch is basically a party for me -- and it's a party that often lasts for months. With both Nvidia and AMD staggering their product releases, there's plenty to get excited for as new models keep getting added to our ranking of the best graphics cards every few weeks. This time, the excitement is only true on paper. In fact, I'm beginning to feel disappointed. After waiting for Blackwell for a long time, it's starting to feel like it would've been better if we waited a little bit longer. The GPU shortage is back As if the launch of Nvidia's RTX 50-series wasn't bumpy enough, it now turns out that some of these GPUs are missing out on a bit of performance, and it's unclear how many cards are affected. Although they still are the best graphics cards right now, some RTX 5090s may not have their full specs, and it's affecting their performance. This was discovered by TechPowerUp, and the affected GPU is a Zotac GeForce RTX 5090 solid, but apparently, cards from other manufacturers might also be affected.

New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing with AI. Updated:                       03\/24\/25       Published:                       03\/14\/25       AI agents are like the backstage crew at the concerts we attend: Operating independently on the backend to deliver a smooth experience on the user end. They power many of the tech we use \u2013 and have for a while \u2013 but haven\u2019t gotten that visibility until recently. In this article, we\u2019ll break down real-world examples of how AI agents are used across industries.  Every time you sift through recommendations on your Netflix, you\u2019re seeing AI agents at work. AI agents take action without constant human intervention by recognizing patterns and predicting behavior.  When Netflix is recommending you shows to watch, that rec list has been compiled by an AI agent tasked with analyzing your watch history and ratings for trends and genre preferences. Brands like Amazon, YouTube, and Spotify all use similar agents to personalize user experience. New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Hotels, ride-hailing apps, and airlines all have one thing in common: Surge pricing \u2013 powered by AI agents. These companies operate on a flexible pricing structure that fluctuates based on factors like supply, demand, and user trends.  Source Take Lyft for instance. If I order a ride at 2 a.m. on a Saturday during Art Basel, it will surely cost me more than on a Tuesday night at 8 a.m. When the user even places the request for a ride, the AI agent evaluates these factors, sets the price, and responds to the user\u2019s request. OpenAI and Google have both introduced AI agents, \u2013 Operator and Mariner respectively \u2013 that can search the web independently and serve as a true assistant, filling up shopping carts and getting answers to your most pressing questions. \u201cIt can understand that it needs to press a button to make something happen,\u201d Demis Hassabis, who oversees Google\u2019s core A.I. lab, said in an interview with The NYT. \u201cIt can take action in the world.\u201d  Source While AI assistants escalate support requests and direct users toward self-service options, AI agents are working behind the scenes to: Sites built on user-generated content \u2013 think Reddit, YouTube, Meta \u2013 require advanced content moderation practices to keep users safe. Human moderators rely on AI agents to do some of the legwork of flagging, reviewing, and sorting content that goes against the site\u2019s policies. Think about how good YouTube has gotten at flagging when a video includes copyrighted music. There\u2019s no human reviewing each upload \u2013 instead, Google relies on AI systems to analyze content as they\u2019re uploaded to the site and take actions if they\u2019re not compliant. For instance, on YouTube, an uploaded video will be muted automatically if it includes copyrighted music. On TikTok, a content creator\u2019s video will be first muted, then removed for review. These steps allow moderation teams to focus on higher priority work and automate routine tasks. When you\u2019re spending money on an ad, you\u2019re looking for return on investment (ROI). Doing so entails optimizing your ad after it\u2019s placed \u2013 that can mean anything from doubling down on the version that performs the best to customizing the ad based on user history. While this can be done manually, it\u2019s not scalable \u2013 and that\u2019s where an AI agent comes in. Based on historical trends and performance data, advertisers can optimize their campaigns in real time, which saves them money and increases ROI. Recruiters on LinkedIn can now automate routine tasks like finding and following up with candidates, and scheduling interviews.  Source According to LinkedIn, recruiters report spending around 20 hours a week on these tasks, and these AI agents can cut that time by half \u2013 at least. While I haven\u2019t had the chance to (read: the guts to) ride in a Waymo, Google\u2019s robotaxi, I can tell you a bit about how it works. To operate safely, Waymo vehicles must rely on AI systems to perceive their surroundings, understand other drivers\u2019 behaviors, control the vehicle, and make safe driving decisions. It relies on real-time and historical data to guide and adapt its actions. Tesla\u2019s AutoPilot feature is another example of an AI agent at work. The stock market is unpredictable. Imagine if you had an AI agent tracking it during pre- and open market hours to recommend strategies? Beyond recommendations, consumers and businesses alike are beginning to leverage AI agents to make trades based on their own risk profiles and investment strategies. U.S. hospitals and healthcare orgs, like Mayo Clinic, are piloting the use of AI agents for a series of administrative tasks, including: \u201cFor some years now, we\u2018ve collected mountains of data in EHRs and data lakes but struggled to translate those insights into meaningful impact. Too often, it\u2019s added more burden to clinicians instead of relieving it,\" said the executive director for Atlantic Health System, an org overseeing over 550 medical care sites, to Becker\u2019s Health It. The next time you get a fraud alert notification from your bank, you\u2019ve likely got an AI agent to thank. (Or rather the team who configured it.)  In the banking space, AI agents monitor users\u2019 transaction activity and track spending habits. When they flag behaviors that fall outside of routine, they\u2019ll respond by freezing cards, alerting users, and requesting transaction approvals. BMW is one of many companies using AI-powered robots to streamline production lines. They operate through a series of complex AI systems that assign them tasks and program them to adjust their behavior based on historical data. Alongside humans, production lines function much more smoothly, allowing workers to focus on higher-impact tasks that require human oversight.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"     Experts say mortgage interest rates could see volatility with the increased risk of a global trade war and recession.    President Trump's announcement this week of an aggressive wave of\u00a0reciprocal tariffs\u00a0on multiple countries and a 10% universal import tax triggered massive\u00a0stock market chaos. The move also escalated fears of inflated consumer prices, a global trade war and a\u00a0recession. \u00a0 It's unclear how these duties will upend supply chains and impact\u00a0interest rates. With the vast number of unknowns in the economy \u2014 from Trump's protectionist measures to federal jobs slashing \u2014 mortgage rates have already seen some dips this week. In March, mortgage rates\u00a0fluctuated in a narrow range, with the average 30-year fixed rate beginning and ending the month at 6.75%, according to Bankrate data.\u00a0 Volatility is still in the cards as financial markets brace for more conclusive takeaways on inflation and unemployment. Generally, mortgage rates, which are linked to the bond market, inch down when economic data is weaker and inch up when that data comes in strong.\u00a0 \"The keyword right now is uncertainty,\" said Colin Robertson, founder of mortgage news site The Truth About Mortgage. \"Nobody knows what tomorrow holds when it comes to tariffs or government policies, and thus mortgage rates are in a holding pattern of sorts.\"\u00a0 While average rates are expected to gradually move closer to 6% in 2025, Robertson said the concern is that lower mortgage rates could be the result of a deteriorating economy. If US families are worried about job security and affording the high cost of living, they'll be less likely to take on mortgage debt, even if rates get cheaper in a downturn.\u00a0 While tariffs won't impact the prices of existing homes, they are likely to drive up the cost of lumber and building materials used to construct new homes. That could lead to fewer new homes being built. \"However, builders might find it challenging to pass on these costs to buyers due to limited pricing power,\" said Mohtashami. \"The overall effect of tariffs on home prices is likely to be minimal,\" he added.\u00a0 The more significant concern is what widespread tariffs and an escalating trade war could mean for mortgage rates. Economists worry that an uptick in prices and retaliation from other countries could hamper the Fed's plans to lower interest rates. Mortgage rates, which are highly sensitive to fiscal policy and economic growth, could increase if inflation stays elevated.\u00a0 Steep rates would not only worsen affordability for buyers, but would also discourage sellers from listing their homes for sale, further constricting the already limited inventory of homes for sale. According to Mohtashami, mortgage rates and the limited supply of existing housing have the biggest impact on the housing market.\u00a0 Even if the Fed doesn't cut its benchmark rate soon, talk of a recession alone can put downward pressure on mortgage rates. In times of high economic uncertainty, investors tend to flock to safer assets, like US Treasury bonds.\u00a0 Increased demand for bonds can push bond yields down and lead to lower mortgage rates, said Odeta Kushi, deputy chief economist at First American Financial Corporation. A weaker economy could provide some temporary borrowing relief in time for the home shopping season. \"Lower rates normally generate more homebuying demand,\" said Rob Cook, CMO at Discover Home Loans. But if cheaper mortgages are a by-product of a shaky economy, it could also keep the housing market frozen. Put simply, a recession won't improve housing affordability over the long term. \"If consumers are uncertain about their own financial futures they will likely pause those plans until they have greater certainty and stronger confidence,\" said Cook.\u00a0 Already, rumors of a potential economic downturn are weighing heavy on consumer confidence. \"Falling consumer sentiment can be a warning sign for the economy,\" said Kushi. \"The concern is that consumer sentiment can harden into sediment.\" Read more: Think a Recession Will Make Homebuying and Mortgages Cheaper? Not Quite In recent years, high mortgage rates have locked out new homebuyers. Expensive interest rates have also contributed to\u00a0keeping resale housing inventory tight, as current homeowners refuse to give up the cheaper,\u00a0sub-5% mortgage rates\u00a0they scored just a few years ago.\u00a0 If lenders reduce rates in time for the spring season, we could see an increase in homebuying. A slowdown in the economy could also encourage the Federal Reserve to\u00a0resume cutting interest rates\u00a0this summer, making overall borrowing less costly.\u00a0 But even as rates and\u00a0prices stay stuck, there has been a modest uptick in homebuyers entering the market. \"For the first time in several years, we are witnessing encouraging trends in purchase application data,\" said\u00a0Logan Mohtashami, lead analyst at HousingWire.\u00a0 After years of buyers sitting on the sidelines, the pent-up demand for houses is likely to explode at some point. \"At least some potential homebuyers have become accustomed (or resigned) to mortgage rates at current levels,\" said\u00a0Keith Gumbinger, vice president at HSH.com. Prospective homebuyers waiting for mortgage rates to drop for the past few years may soon have to adjust to the \"higher for longer\" rate environment, with mortgage loan rates fluctuating between 5% and 7% over the longer term.\u00a0 Rates around 6% may seem high compared to the recent 2% rates of the pandemic era. But experts say getting below 3% on a mortgage is unlikely without a severe economic downturn. Since the 1970s, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has been around 7%.\u00a0 Today's unaffordable housing market is a result of a combination of high mortgage rates, a long-standing housing shortage, expensive home prices and a loss of purchasing power due to inflation. While market forces are out of your control, there are ways to make buying a home slightly more affordable.\u00a0 Here's what experts recommend if you're in the market for a home in 2025:\u00a0 \ud83d\udcb0 Build your credit score. Your credit score will help determine whether you qualify for a mortgage and at what interest rate. A credit score of 740 or higher will help you qualify for a lower rate. \ud83d\udcb0 Save for a bigger down payment.\u00a0A larger down payment allows you to take out a smaller mortgage and get a lower interest rate from your lender. If you can afford it, a down payment of at least 20% will also eliminate private mortgage insurance. \ud83d\udcb0 Shop for mortgage lenders.\u00a0Comparing loan offers from multiple mortgage lenders can help you negotiate a better rate. Experts recommend getting at least two to three loan estimates from different lenders. \ud83d\udcb0 Consider mortgage points.\u00a0You can get a lower mortgage rate by buying mortgage points, with each point costing 1% of the total loan amount. One mortgage point equals a 0.25% decrease in your mortgage rate.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"MSI RTX 5070 Ti 16G Shadow 3X OC is available now for \u00a3729. I want to believe the GPU gods are finally throwing us a bone. MSI RTX 5070 Ti 16G Shadow 3X OC is actually available on Amazon UK right now for \u00a3729. That\u2019s not a typo. It\u2019s in stock, sold and shipped by Amazon, and somehow not priced into orbit. When scalpers are still charging north of \u00a31000 for this card, seeing a legit listing for retail price feels like someone left the vault door open and forgot to sound the alarm. \u00a3729 Amazon: See here In my opinion, this is the GPU to aim for if you're gaming at 1440p or even poking at 4K. It's built on Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture, comes loaded with 16GB of GDDR6X, and puts RTX 4070 SUPER in an awkward spot for just \u00a374 more. Speaking of which, MSI's RTX 4070 Super Gaming X Slim is currently going for \u00a3654.99, down from \u00a3700.99 with a 7% discount. Solid value, sure, but with less VRAM, a narrower memory bus, and older ray tracing cores, I think the 5070 Ti is simply the smarter buy if you want some proper future-proofing. You\u2019re getting more bandwidth, more VRAM, and a chunkier performance margin for less than a hundred quid extra. I think it\u2019s a no-brainer unless you already own the 4070 SUPER, in which case, carry on and pretend you didn\u2019t read this. We\u2019ve spent time testing the RTX 5070 Ti in real-world scenarios, and it performs exactly how you'd hope for a mid-to-high-tier GPU in 2025. At 1440p, it crushes almost everything you throw at it while staying cool and quiet. It\u2019s noticeably faster than the 4070 SUPER, especially in games that lean heavily on VRAM and bandwidth like Cyberpunk 2077 or Alan Wake 2. Ray tracing performance has improved, and DLSS 3.5 adds a nice boost where supported. In my opinion, it\u2019s the best balance of power and price in the 5000 series so far. It avoids the overheating and power draw issues of the 5090 and doesn\u2019t feel as compromised as the upcoming 5060 looks on paper. The SHADOW 3X OC model from MSI also helps with thermal headroom thanks to its chunky triple-fan cooler. If you\u2019ve tried to get one of these cards over the last month, you already know how rare they are. Most 5070 Ti listings vanish in minutes or get flipped on auction sites for \u00a31000+, which is genuinely outrageous. That\u2019s why I think prebuilt PCs like these CyberPower deals are starting to look like the smart option, especially when they\u2019re actually good.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"The MSI Claw 8 AI+ offers the best performance of any PC gaming handheld available right now. Here's where to get it.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  According to MSI, the Claw 8 AI+ and MSI Claw 7 AI+ gaming handhelds launched on January 15, 2025, but stock has been so low that many retailers still haven't gotten inventory for these anticipated gaming devices. That said, some lucky gamers have already been able to get their hands on these Claw AI+ handhelds. I've been able to test and use the Claw 8 AI+ for a few weeks, and it's blown me away with its amazing performance that greatly outshines ASUS ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go, so I'm eager for others to get their own Claw AI+ handhelds. To help, I've put together this tracking page to let you know when and where the Claw AI+ handhelds are in stock so you can buy one for yourself.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"By\u00a0         Sydney Lupkin                        Cannabis plants at Vibe Cultivators, an indoor growing facility and dispensary in Sacramento, Calif., are about 2 weeks away from harvest. California's cannabis regulator inspects facilities like this regularly in an effort to keep contaminants out of the weed supply.                                                           Preston Gannaway for NPR                                       hide caption  At Vibe Cultivators, an indoor cannabis farm in Sacramento, the first thing to hit you is the smell. Earthy, skunky, whatever you want to call it, that is some pungent weed. There are aisles of plants, growing on two levels under artificial lights. They have names like Gelato 33 and Alien Runtz. \"As you can see, all our plants are tagged,\" says Brian Prichard, Vibe's entrepreneur in residence. The state-sanctioned tags are a sign this isn't weed grown by a guy who knows a guy. They contain the name of the state-licensed grower, the license number and an ID number just for the plant, so cannabis regulators can keep track of it. Check out the rest of the series: How safe is your weed? Things have changed since the days before California legalized marijuana, Prichard says. Back then, he had to be secretive about his work, which meant asking for help was challenging.                  Rows of carefully tagged plants grow at Vibe Cultivators in Sacramento. The industry is largely supportive of California's push to regulate it and keep harmful products from hitting the market.                                                           Preston Gannaway for NPR                                       hide caption  \"Before, you know, I'd go to Home Depot and I'd tell them, 'I need this part and this part to make something.' Well, they want to know what I'm making. 'Well, I can't tell you... I just need these parts,'\" Prichard says. Now, he can just ask for information, even from state regulators. The California Department of Cannabis Control officially formed in 2021, combining what various other state agencies were doing to stay on top of the newly formed legal weed industry in the state. One of its primary jobs is to keep weed safe. It's a task many states with legalized marijuana struggle with, in the absence of federal support or guidance. And without a deep well of scientific research \u2013 it hasn't been easy. Weed can contain mold, bacteria, or even heavy metals like arsenic. It can also be unexpectedly potent, not matching the THC levels on its label. States are trying to keep weed consumers from getting sick, while  supporting a growing, tax-paying industry. \"We like to say around here that we're building the plane as we fly it,\" says Zarha Ruiz, who leads environmental compliance and manufacturing safety at California's Department of Cannabis Control. \"Nothing could be more accurate.\"                  Left: Vibe Cultivators cheerful exterior. Right: Cody Daniel defoliates cannabis plants inside Vibe Cultivators.                                           Preston Gannaway for NPR                                       hide caption  For cannabis, unlike for brownie mix or Tylenol, there's no federal Food and Drug Administration to keep consumers safe. In that vacuum, weed regulators from several states came together to form the Cannabis Regulators Association, says Gillian Schauer, the group's executive director. \"States were struggling to set up literally their own mini FDAs and mini EPAs to try to do the due diligence that was needed,\" Schauer says. The states share information, holding meetings and webinars to update each other on what's working and discuss evolving best practices, for instance. But they don't all test for the same things. According to a 2022 study about the patchwork of regulation around the country, states were testing for more than 600 contaminants in all. \"Interestingly, in each jurisdiction there's only anywhere between 60 to 120 contaminants that are regulated,\" says Maxwell Leung, an assistant professor at Arizona State University who authored the study. For example, a contaminant might lead to a recall in one state. But another state may not even be testing for it.                  Zarha Ruiz, branch chief of environmental compliance and manufacturing safety at the Department of Cannabis Control, outside Vibe Cultivators.                                                           Preston Gannaway for NPR                                       hide caption  Testing for more contaminants isn't necessarily better, however, he says. Without a vast body of research, scientists and regulators don't know which contaminants have the biggest impact on human health. Still, California has seen recalls of legal weed \u2014 it had 63 last year, the most since the Department of Cannabis Control formed in 2021. That meant sellers had to yank 25,000 individual units of cannabis products from their shelves, because of things like microbial contamination or misbranding. The California Cannabis Industry Association which represents growers, manufacturers and dispensaries, generally supports the state's effort to regulate. The association says it's \"heartened\" by the state's recent work on recalls, which came after an investigation called out the state for missing illegal pesticides in legal weed. \"That's not to say there isn't room for improvement in any emerging industry, and cannabis is no exception,\" says Caren Woodsen, the president of the association's board of directors. For Ruiz in California, the regulators' priority is keeping people safe. People in the industry remember the EVALI crisis, a 2019 outbreak of lung injuries and hospitalizations across all 50 states linked to vape products containing vitamin E acetate, an additive in some e-cigarettes with THC. At least 68 people died, including four in California. The possible health risks aren't confined to smoking. The Department of Cannabis Control also regulates edibles like gummies, brownies and sodas. In those types of products, the THC dose may be higher than indicated by the label. Edibles may also be contaminated by bacteria, which could sicken the person who consumes it.                  Wyld's grapefruit-flavored gummies are poured into molds, cured, coated in sugar and then packaged for distribution at a factory in Sacramento, Calif.                                                           Sydney Lupkin                                       hide caption  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, emergency room visits related to cannabis increased between 2019 and 2022 for people under 25. Earlier research showed edibles were responsible for a disproportionate share of cannabis-related ER visits. Down the street from the Sacramento pot farm, there's a factory that makes a product called Wyld gummies. On a recent grapefruit gummy-making day, a machine poured the solution into rectangular molds. Everyone was wearing hair nets, masks and blue gloves. It looked and smelled like any other factory that makes food, but stored in a metal locker inside a back room, there's a special ingredient: THC oil. \"Our gummies are four grams, but only 10 milligrams of that is cannabis or cannabinoid product,\" says Gabe Parton Lee, the company's attorney. \"And so the majority is just candy.\" Still, it's inspected by the California Department of Cannabis Control instead of the FDA or state inspectors under contract with the FDA. In the distribution room, hundreds of boxes of marionberry flavored gummies are cordoned off to the side under a sign that says \"Quarantine Area\" in red lettering. The gummies are awaiting batch testing results at one of 27 licensed labs around the state before they can be loaded on trucks and on their way to retail destinations. Inspectors will be checking for contaminants and THC levels. In California, the Department of Cannabis Control tracks almost every step in the cannabis pipeline. Weed manufacturers even have to report how many pounds of plant trimmings they throw away.                  Research scientist Hung Liu runs tests at the Department of Cannabis Control laboratory in Richmond, Calif., in January. Labs are looking for contaminants such as illegal pesticides and heavy metals.                                                           Preston Gannaway for NPR                                       hide caption  The department's lab in Richmond, near San Francisco, leads the state-licensed labs. It uses sensitive machines to test for hundreds of contaminants, setting standards and helping law enforcement with investigations involving the illicit marijuana market. And as the California cannabis industry has evolved, the lab has had to keep up, finding ways to test everything from gummies to hard candies to beverages to popcorn. \"There's all kinds of things that people are infusing with cannabinoids that we have to be able to extract them out of to then declare if it is accurately labeled\" or that the labeled dosage is accurate,\" says Antonio Frazier, branch chief for the department's Laboratory Services Division. \"It's a very interesting industry and I love it because you see so much ingenuity. I mean, you're seeing really creative products out there.\" Over the last five years, the legal cannabis market has gotten a lot cleaner, especially compared to what he's seen in the illicit market. \"We see the levels of illegal pesticides that are 10, 100 times the actual limit coming from the illicit market,\" he says. The DCC has also occasionally found fentanyl in non-regulated cannabis products.                  A research scientist measures water activity in a flower sample at a Department of Cannabis Control lab.                                                           Preston Gannaway for NPR                                       hide caption  In other words, it's still safer to buy regulated weed than illicit weed \u2013 even though regulated weed is more expensive.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"ByJohn Dorfman  ByJohn Dorfman,  Contributor.  Scene in Paris, France, before the 2024 Olympics. France is one of several countries whose stock ... More markets are outperforming the U.S. market so far this year. (Photo by Kevin Voigt\/GettyImages) This year through March 21, stocks were up 9% in France, 15% in Germany, and 18% in Hong Kong. In the U.S. stocks were down 3%. A little international diversification might be a good idea, especially with U.S. stocks currently on the expensive side. Yet many American investors have 100% of their portfolios in U.S.-based companies. If you want a few international stocks in your portfolio, here are five that I think are worthy of consideration. In Germany, I like Hannover Rueck SE (HVRRY) a reinsurance company (an insurer to insurers) based in Hannover. It gets about 18% of its revenue in Europe, 16% in Britain, 42% in North America, and 24% in the rest of the world. Hannover Rueck has notched a profit in 22 of the past 23 years. It had a modest loss in 2008, the height of the great financial crisis. The stock seems moderately valued to me, selling for 14 times recent earnings, and is up 16% this year. In Japan, I\u2019m drawn to Hikari Tsushin Inc. (HKTGF), which sells networking and automation products to small and medium-sized businesses. For example, it offers routers, LED lighting and water coolers. It has grown its earnings at a 22% annual clip over the past decade, though revenue growth was considerably slower. The stock sells for only 11 times recent earnings. It\u2019s up about 6% this year. In France, I\u2019m partial to Total Energies SE (TTE). It\u2019s France\u2019s biggest oil company and is also active in solar and wind energy. The stock weighs in at less than 10 times earnings, 0.8 times revenue and 1.2 times book value (corporate net worth per share), even though it\u2019s up 15% year-to-date. The company produces or sells energy in 120 countries. It has attracted both praise and criticism for its close relationship with the French government, and for dealing with Russia and China. I\u2019m almost entirely out of China these days, mostly because I dislike the governing philosophy and methods of President Xi Jinping. I have no Chinese stocks for most clients, and only one small holding in my hedge fund. Nonetheless, many Chinese stocks are cheap at the moment. One is JD.com Inc. (JD), which is one of the three largest e-commerce companies in China. (Alibaba is the largest; JD.com and Pinduoduo fight for second.) JD.com has increased its sales at a 34% annual pace over the past decade. The stock, up 23% this year, still sells for only 11 times earnings. What company manufactures semiconductor chips for Apple, Nvidia and Qualcomm? The answer is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), universally recognized as the world\u2019s most advanced chip maker. Taiwan Semiconductor boasts a net profit margin of about 40%, a return on equity of more than 30%, and five-year earnings growth exceeding 25%. If a U.S. company posted numbers like that, I believe it would be priced in the stratosphere. Taiwan Semiconductor sells for 25 times recent earnings, not cheap but not terribly expensive either. That\u2019s because the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan hangs over its head like a sword of Damocles. Foreign stocks are riskier than American ones in some respects. Most countries have accounting standards less rigorous than those in the U.S., and less vigorous enforcement of those standards. Many countries have economic swings wider than those in America. In some countries, expropriation is a risk. Also, investment gains can sometimes be wiped out by currency fluctuations. If you make, say, a 10% gain in Euros, but the dollar appreciates 11% against the Euro, you have a loss. This is the 20th column I\u2019ve written since 1998 recommending some non-U.S. stocks. The average one-year return on the recommendations in my previous 19 columns has been 14.4%. That edges out the average return on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Total Return Index for the same periods, at 14.2%. My most recent column on the subject (January 2023) pulled down my batting average. My picks advanced 7.6% in 12 months, while the S&P 500 roared ahead 24.6%. My best pick was Itochu Corp (ITOCF) of Japan, up 40%. Worst was Aurubis AG (AIAGY) of Germany, down 28%. Of the 19 columns, 15 were profitable but only nine beat the S&P 500. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn\u2019t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn\u2019t predict the future. Disclosure: I own Total Energies and Taiwan Semiconductor personally and for most of my clients.","label":1}

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  GOOG Stock   We believe Alphabet could be poised to more than triple its valuation from an already impressive $2 trillion, potentially becoming the world\u2019s most valuable company by a significant margin. Despite a recent 10% decline following mixed Q4 results and higher projected capital expenditures, the real growth opportunity may lie in an often-overlooked asset \u2014 the Waymo robotaxi service. As an aside, some good news on tariffs boosted tech stocks recently. See Time To Buy META Stock At $620?  Once a speculative initiative, Waymo is quickly transforming into a viable business that could revolutionize transportation and unlock significant value for Alphabet. If it scales effectively, Alphabet\u2019s stock could surpass $500. Here\u2019s why. Separately, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Fact: Waymo has increased its weekly paid rides from 10,000 two years ago to around 150,000 by the end of 2024. Currently, Google reports that Waymo is providing over 200,000 paid trips per week across San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Phoenix. Now, consider the broader ride-hailing market. Uber facilitated more than 230 million rides per week in Q4 alone \u2014 which adds up to approximately 12.5 billion rides annually. At an average fare of $30, that translates into an annual revenue pool of about $375 billion. Given Waymo\u2019s current volume of over 200,000 autonomous rides per week, how many additional people might opt for self-driving rides instead of driving themselves? The potential shift is significant. For every person using a ride-hailing service today, at least 10 others still drive their own vehicles. Many of them might reconsider once they observe millions enjoying a stress-free ride while watching Netflix, compared to being stuck behind the wheel. Early indicators support this trend. According to Earnest Analytics, Waymo retains users at a higher rate than Uber or Lyft. This suggests that once riders try a fully autonomous experience, they prefer it. Safety is another major benefit. Waymo\u2019s safety report last year indicated a 78% reduction in injury-causing accidents compared to human drivers. Investors will soon realize that the $375 billion current ride-hailing market could grow significantly \u2014 possibly more than threefold. A $1 trillion+ autonomous ride-hailing market isn\u2019t out of reach. Yes, but not all are making the same level of progress. Waymo has an early advantage. One of its top competitors, GM-backed Cruise, lost its driverless permits in California following a serious incident, making Waymo the only publicly accessible robotaxi service in San Francisco. Uber exited its self-driving program over six years ago and now partners with Waymo to integrate autonomous rides into the Uber app in certain cities. They recently began offering robotaxi rides in Austin, Texas, just ahead of the SXSW festival. Meanwhile, Tesla \u2014 often seen as an autonomous driving leader \u2014 has not yet entered the ride-hailing space. Though it revealed a Robotaxi concept last year, the vehicle is not yet in production. Furthermore, Elon Musk\u2019s growing involvement in politics may alienate some potential customers. Waymo also leads in technology. Its fleet features a robust mix of high-resolution cameras, LiDAR, and radar systems, enabling a comprehensive view of its surroundings. And let\u2019s not forget Google\u2019s secret weapon \u2014 its vast user base, which helps crowdsource annotated data like CAPTCHA codes to train its AI models. This offers a major advantage in understanding complex driving conditions. These are self-driving vehicles \u2014 no human drivers, no unions, no employment-related complications, and no labor costs. Although software development and battery costs remain, eliminating driver wages could result in very high profit margins. Margins of 50% are not unrealistic, considering how much driver pay eats into traditional ride-hailing revenues. If Waymo captures roughly one-third of a $1 trillion autonomous ride-hailing market, it could generate about $300 billion in annual revenue. With 50% margins, that equates to $150 billion in profit. At a 30x earnings multiple, this could translate into an additional $4.5 trillion valuation for Alphabet. Given Alphabet\u2019s current valuation of around $2.1 trillion, this could boost the company\u2019s total market cap to over $6.5 trillion, or more than $500 per share. Admittedly, reaching this scale will take time \u2014 unlike signing up for services like Google or Netflix. Investors need to take a long-term view. Think 2030, or even 2035. The key takeaway is that Alphabet is scaling Waymo rapidly, has the technology and strategic advantage, and is addressing a massive potential market, making this lofty valuation possible. GOOG stock performance over the past four years has been notably inconsistent, with annual returns showing more volatility than the S&P 500. Returns were 65% in 2021, -39% in 2022, 59% in 2023, and 35% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which includes 30 stocks, has shown significantly less volatility. Over the past four years, it has outperformed the S&P 500 comfortably. Why is that? As a group, the HQ Portfolio stocks have provided better returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index \u2014 less of a roller-coaster ride, as shown in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Considering today\u2019s uncertain macroeconomic environment \u2014 rate cut expectations, ongoing conflicts \u2014 could GOOG experience a similar underperformance as in 2022 over the next 12 months, or will it see another surge? Investors may be underestimating not just Waymo\u2019s promise but also Alphabet\u2019s overall Internet business, which continues to perform well. In Q4 2024, Google\u2019s cloud segment revenue jumped 30% to $11.96 billion. Google search revenue rose 12.5% to $54 billion, and YouTube ad revenue climbed 13.8% to $10.5 billion. Overall, Google\u2019s revenues for the quarter reached $96.5 billion, up 12% year-over-year. In addition to revenue growth, Alphabet\u2019s operating margin expanded by 500 basis points year-over-year to 32% in Q4. The combination of increased revenue and margin expansion led to a 31% increase in earnings per share to $2.15. The stock remains attractively valued, trading at just 19x consensus 2025 earnings and 17x consensus 2026 earnings.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"Business Insider Edition  Things have gone downhill for genetic testing company 23andMe.          CEO Anne Wojcicki resigned and 23andMe filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday \u2014 roughly six months after its board resigned, citing disagreements on the company's strategic direction.               Data hacks, a class action lawsuit, and leadership tension between Wojcicki and the board have left 23andMe's fate in the balance as it searches for a buyer.               Many have expressed concern a takeover or sale of the company could mean the sale of user data. The director of cybersecurity at Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital privacy, previously urged their 186,000 X followers to delete their data from 23andMe. That post garnered more than 531,000 views in three days.               23andMe says the personal data it collects includes registration information like birth date, genetic information like a user's genotype, sample information like saliva, and self-reported information.               Yet \"beyond our contracted laboratory, with which we work to process a customer's sample and deliver their results, customer information will not be shared with any other entity unless they provide us with consent to do so,\" a 23andMe spokesperson previously told Business Insider.               The spokesperson said the company doesn't share data with \"employers, insurance companies, law enforcement agencies or any public databases.\"               Users are still concerned, however, about their information.               \"Data is data \u2014 once it's out there, it's very hard to control,\" James Hazel, a biomedical researcher, told Business Insider in 2019.               Users who want their personal information removed from 23andMe can opt out in the \"23andMe Data\" section in Account Settings. But 23andMe says it is legally required to retain some information.               \"While we will delete the majority of your Personal Information, we are required to retain some information to comply with our legal obligation,\" the company's website says.               \"23andMe and\/or our contracted genotyping laboratory will retain your Genetic Information, date of birth, and sex as required for compliance with applicable legal obligations... even if you chose to delete your account,\" the company's privacy statement says.               The privacy statement says 23andMe will also retain some information associated with user accounts, like email addresses.               For users who participated in 23andMe Research, their genetic data and self-reported information won't be used in future research projects.               \"Customers always have the option to delete their account at any time, and once the request is confirmed, we will immediately and automatically begin the deletion process,\" the spokesperson said. \"Deleting an account and associated data will permanently delete the data associated with all profiles within the account. If a customer asks us to store their genetic samples, they will be discarded.\"               After the direct-to-consumer genetic testing company launched in 2006, it appeared to be on a steady incline and a notable standout among Silicon Valley ventures. As of 2021, according to Crunchbase, it had raised over $1 billion from investors.               The DNA testing firm just couldn't seem to clear a series of problematic hurdles kicked off by a 2023 data hack.           News that hackers were selling user data \u2014 which included birth details and names \u2014 on the dark web broke that October. The company confirmed in December that hackers had accessed ancestry data for just under 7 million users. A data breach notification filing in January said it took 23andMe five months to realize hackers had stolen the data.               The incident led to a class action lawsuit, which 23andMe settled this September for $30 million, according to Reuters.               Less than a week later, the independent directors of 23andMe's board resigned in a letter addressed to Wojcicki.               In their resignation letter, the directors said they \"wholeheartedly support\" 23andMe's mission, but \"it is also clear that we differ on the strategic direction for the Company going forward.\"               In November, 23andMe laid off about 40% of its staff due to cost cuts, and later in the same month said it had debts of $2.3 billion in an SEC filing. It will continue operating as it searches for a buyer.               The Wall Street Journal reported that despite earning $299 million in revenue in 2023 and $219 million in 2024, the company never made a profit. Its stock price peaked in February 2021 but has steadily declined since.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"ByJoe Cornell  ByJoe Cornell,  Contributor.  (AP Photo\/Richard Drew, File) Deal OverviewAs per media articles on March 17, 2025, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN; $196.21, Market Capitalization: $2.1 trillion), the world\u2019s largest e-commerce company, is considering spinning off its India business and listing it on the domestic stock market. If implemented, this strategy would enable Amazon to strengthen its foothold in one of the rapidly expanding digital markets while adhering to India\u2019s stringent e-commerce regulations. Data localization requirements and the ability to maintain direct inventory are among the key factors driving this consideration. Indian regulations only permit domestic companies to use an inventory model in e-commerce, limiting foreign players like Amazon from operating under a marketplace model.  Post-separation, Amazon India (SpinCo) would retain its existing operations, including an online marketplace, which would continue to offer a diverse range of products across various categories to cater to the Indian market. In addition to its e-commerce platform, it will also continue to own Amazon Prime platform for an expedited shipping and streaming service, Amazon Pay for digital payments, and Amazon Business for B2B transactions. Amazon.com Inc Price Performance Spin-Off Details and Top 5 Shareholders On the other hand, Amazon (RemainCo) would remain focused on its core operations, including e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence services. The separation would enable the company to allocate resources more efficiently while allowing Amazon India to focus on local expansion and innovation. Amazon has begun conversations with banking advisors regarding a potential spin-off and local listing in India. Recently, the company\u2019s management, including senior executives from India and the US, held discussions with a couple of investment bankers, including its Wall Street banker, JP Morgan. While these discussions are in the preliminary stages, they signify Amazon\u2019s intent to adapt its business model to better align with local market dynamics and regulatory frameworks. Deal Rationale  Amazon India, a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc., operates as an online marketplace, offering various products across various categories to cater to the Indian market. In addition to its e-commerce platform, Amazon India provides services such as Amazon Prime for an expedited shipping and streaming service, Amazon Pay for digital payments, and Amazon Business for B2B transactions.  Amazon\u2019s consideration to spin off its Indian division and pursue a domestic listing is likely influenced by several strategic factors dependent on the dynamics of the Indian market. One of the key factors is India\u2019s regulatory framework, which prohibits companies with foreign direct investment of 51.0% or more from running inventory based e-commerce operations. These regulations mandate that foreign companies function as marketplaces connecting buyers and sellers, limiting their control over inventory management. In contrast, domestic companies can manage inventory directly, enabling faster deliveries, improved branding, and reduced shipping costs. By spinning off its Indian operations into a locally listed entity, Amazon could potentially navigate these restrictions more effectively, aligning its business model with local regulations. Another significant factor is data localization. Indian regulations mandate that data generated within the country must be stored locally. By creating a separate entity for its Indian operations, Amazon can ensure compliance with these regulations more effectively, thereby avoiding potential legal and operational challenges. In recent years, Amazon has also faced certain challenges in India, losing market share to Flipkart, which now holds around half of the country\u2019s e-commerce market. Furthermore, it is encountering increasing competition from SoftBank-backed Meesho, which recently raised over $500 million in new funding. The company\u2019s recent struggles in the quick commerce segment have also likely influenced the spin-off decision. While pilot services have begun, it faces stiff competition from established players such as Flipkart\u2019s Minutes, JioMart, Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit, and Zepto, all of which have a strong foothold in the segment. A spin-off could enable Amazon to compete more effectively by aligning its operations closely with local market dynamics. The Indian e-commerce market is projected to grow from $123 billion in 2024 to $292.3 billion in 2028, reflecting a CAGR of 18.7%. This rapid growth presents a compelling opportunity for Amazon. A more autonomous and locally attuned entity would position Amazon to capitalize on this growth. We believe, a spinoff would enable the company to tailor its strategies more precisely to local consumer behaviors and preferences, enhancing its competitiveness against domestic rivals.  In summary, Amazon\u2019s potential spinoff and domestic listing of its Indian business are driven by regulatory navigation, market growth opportunities, and localization strategies. This strategic move aims to align Amazon\u2019s operations more closely with India\u2019s unique market dynamics, positioning it for sustained success in the region.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Compal has introduced the Adapt X, a modular laptop concept that takes inspiration from Framework\u2019s user-upgradable design. The Adapt X recently won an iF Design Award, recognizing its innovative approach to modular computing, where users can swap out and upgrade key components rather than replacing the entire device. Much like Framework\u2019s modular laptops, the Adapt X features a repairable and customizable design, allowing users to replace the display, keyboard, battery, and even ports with minimal effort. The goal is to extend the device\u2019s lifespan, reduce electronic waste, and give consumers greater control over their hardware. According to Compal, the laptop uses a magnet-based assembly, making it easy to disassemble and upgrade without specialized tools. While the exact specifications remain unclear, the iF Design listing highlights sustainability as a core focus of the Adapt X. The chassis is built with recycled materials, and the modular nature of the laptop means fewer discarded components when upgrading. Hot-swappable ports, a key feature also found in Framework laptops, let users customize their I\/O selection depending on their needs. Compal is primarily an original design manufacturer (ODM), meaning the Adapt X might not be sold directly to consumers. Instead, the concept could be licensed or adapted by major PC brands looking to enter the modular laptop market. This wouldn\u2019t be the first time a manufacturer experimented with modular designs, but few have achieved mainstream success beyond Framework\u2019s niche market. If Compal or a partner brand brings the Adapt X to market, it could signal growing industry interest in repairable, upgradable laptops. With companies like Dell and Lenovo also experimenting with modular concepts, the success of Framework may be influencing the broader laptop industry. However, whether the Adapt X will make it beyond the prototype stage remains to be seen. The Framework Laptop had quite an ambitious premise upon release -- a \"modular\" laptop that was made to be tinkered with and upgraded. After using the device myself, I walked away convinced that Framework was onto something. At least, in theory. The true test would come when it was time for a major upgrade, when the clever design and sustainable practices of a fully upgradable laptop could shine. And a year later, I've received the Intel 12th-gen Mainboard upgrade, and I'm more sold on Framework's philosophy than ever before. Digging in The Framework Laptop is one of the most unique tech gadgets out there, as a fully modular and upgradeable laptop. Just how upgradeable is it? Well, to prove its point, the company is now selling a CPU upgrade to Intel's latest 12th-gen processors, which are now available for pre-order. For the uninitiated, Framework Laptops were launched last year as fully modular devices that allow you to essentially put together your own laptop with compatible parts. If the part goes bad or if you want to upgrade, it's a simple matter of switching out the part. You can even switch out all the ports to create the ideal connectivity you need. Modular laptops are a niche but growing segment of the PC market aimed at DIY enthusiasts and eco warriors alike. Now, a new option has launched that hopes to help cut down on waste and give users more choice and upgradeability at the same time. The PrimeBook Circular is the first laptop from Swiss company Prime Computer, and offers users a product whose parts can be swapped out at will, theoretically helping to extend its life span as old and outdated parts get replaced by more modern alternatives over time. \r Please enable Javascript to view this content  Upgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"Genetic testing company 23andMe has filed for bankruptcy after its board rejected a bid from its CEO to take it private. Four years ago the genetic testing company was valued at $3.5 billion. Now it\u2019ll be lucky if someone pays $50 million for it. If you haven\u2019t done it yet, there\u2019s never been a better time to delete your 23andMe data. The company filed for bankruptcy on Sunday after weeks of a collapsing stock price and multiple unsuccessful bids to buy the company and take it private from co-founder and former CEO Anne Wojcicki. Its board did not want Wojcick and found her bids wanting. Reuters said her last pitch was 41 cents a share to take the company private, which would have valued the company at just $11 million. She resigned as CEO after this bid failed. In 2021, Forbes declared Wojcicki America\u2019s newest \u201cself made billionaire\u201d after she cut a deal with Richard Branson to launch the 23andMe IPO. Now she\u2019s posting through the collapse of her company on X.com and trying to find a way back into the business she started. \u201cI have resigned as CEO of the company so I can be in the best position to pursue the company as an independent bidder,\u201d she said in a long post on X. \u201cWhat made so many of our innovations possible were the 85% of our customers who opted in to research. Thanks to them they have empowered an incredible platform for discovery,\u201d Wojcicki said. \u201c23andMe was not a good steward of that data,\u201d Wojcicki said in her post. Which is true. Under Wojcicki\u2019s tenure, 23andMe were bad stewards of people\u2019s data. The company launched in 2006 and became a sensation after Oprah added one of its genetic testing kits to her list of \u201cfavorite things.\u201d The pitch was simple: 23andMe would take a swab of your data and tell you about your genetics, including your propensity towards certain diseases and possible ancestors. 23andMe\u2019s fortunes soured in 2023 after a hacker breached its servers and exposed the genetic data of 6.9 million customers. The company didn\u2019t handle it well. First it said that only 14,000 people had been exposed before it copped to the much larger number. Then it changed its terms of service on the sly in an attempt to dump angry customers into a mass arbitration process. In the end it agreed to pay a $30 million settlement and foot the bill for credit monitoring of the millions of people it exposed. \u201cOur foundation was the trust and respect of our customers, and they were always the guiding light on how we made decisions,\u201d Wojcicki said in her post on X Monday morning. The data breach eroded that trust. The foundation was ruined. Throughout 2023 and 2024, 23andMe\u2019s stock price tumbled and at the end of 2024 it laid off 200 employees. The layoffs deepened concerns that it could keep people\u2019s genetic information safe and that it had a path of making money at all. One of Wojcicki\u2019s proposed solutions to turning the company around was bullying users into allowing their genetic data to be used for scientific research. \u201cWe now have the ability to mine the dataset for ourselves, as well as to partner with other groups,\u201d the former CEO told Wired in 2024. It was a profound misreading of the moment. \u201cWe have had many successes but I equally take accountability for the challenges we have today,\u201d Wojcicki said on X after she resigned. \u201cThere is no doubt that the challenges faced by 23andMe through an evolving business model have been real, but my belief in the company and its future is unwavering. Consumers are rising up and asking for more control over their health and want greater knowledge about how to be healthy and why they may have health issues.\u201d She\u2019s right, consumers are rising up and taking control over their health. One of the ways they\u2019re doing it is by kicking gimmick genetic testing services like 23andMe out of their life. The truth is there\u2019s not much the service can tell you. A complete genetic panel requires an in-depth screening of your entire family. Thanksgiving is hard enough without trying to get your uncle to spit into a tube. After 23andMe and similar services hit the market, a lot of people got the tests done so they could learn more about their ethnic backgrounds. Americans wanted to know if the stories about being one-sixth Cherokee were true and they had found a test that could tell them. But once the test had been paid for, what else did 23andMe have? It attempted to sell a subscription service that cost $1,188 a year. A cheaper version of the plan cost $298 up front and just $69 a year. But consumers weren\u2019t buying and the data breach moved some of them to delete their account and reconsider what personal data they gave to the company. With Wojcicki out, CFO Joe Selsavage is taking over to see the company through its bankruptcy. It got $35 million in financing to help it through the process and listed its assets and liabilities between $100 million and $500 million. It\u2019s impossible to know what will happen to the data of the millions of people who swabbed a cheek and sent in a sample. So, again, it\u2019s time to delete your data. \u201cIf I am fortunate enough to secure the company\u2019s assets through the restructuring process, I remain committed to our long-term vision of being a global leader in genetics and establishing genetics as a fundamental part of healthcare ecosystems worldwide,\u201d Wojcicki said on X, perhaps misreading the moment once again.  23andMedata privacygenetic testing  \r           Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r          \r           News from the future, delivered to your present.\r          \r       Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r                 There's only so much you can learn from a consumer DNA test, and most people simply don't need one.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"Business Insider Edition  Snap CEO Evan Spiegel says creativity starts with failure \u2014 and he makes sure new hires get there quickly.          Snap's new designers are asked to present an idea on their first day despite having little context or time to prepare, Spiegel said on a recent episode of \"The Diary of a CEO\" podcast.               \"When you have no context for what the company is working on, no idea what's going on, how on earth are you supposed to come up with a great idea? I mean, it's almost impossible,\" Spiegel said.\"So your worst fear has come true \u2014 we're all sitting there, looking at an idea that's ultimately not that great.\"               First days can be nerve-racking enough without being asked to make an ill-prepared presentation to your new colleagues. But for Spiegel, that early failure is precisely the point. By forcing new hires to showcase an idea with no preparation, context, or background, Spiegel believes the worst fears around failure evaporate early, leaving employees creatively liberated.               \"Ninety-nine percent of ideas are not good \u2014 but 1% is,\" he said. \"And the best way to have a good idea is to have lots of ideas.\"               Ultimately, Spiegel said, \"All feedback is good feedback. What you do with it is what matters.\"               Spiegel credits Snap's creativity to its culture of constant experimentation more than a decade after its launch.               Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, famously introduced disappearing photos and videos and became known for introducing features like Stories, which were later copied by platforms including Instagram and Facebook.               Spiegel's LinkedIn profile recently poked fun at this, describing him as \"VP Product @ Meta\" \u2014 a gag an employee was behind, he told Bloomberg.               Spiegel founded Snapchat while studying at Stanford and became the world's youngest billionaire at 25.               Snap completed a 2017 IPO with a valuation of about $24 billion. Its market cap now stands at $15.65 billion. The company famously turned down a $3 billion acquisition offer from Mark Zuckerberg's Meta \u2014 then Facebook \u2014 in 2013.               Spiegel also pushed back on perfectionism in startup culture. \"People who think the game is to have the perfect idea \u2014 those are people who've never built a business before,\" he added.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  LINCOLNWOOD, ILLINOIS - JANUARY 31: A Cadillac Lyriq 450E is offered for sale at the Zeigler ... More Cadillac of Lincolnwood dealership on January 31, 2023 in Lincolnwood, Illinois. (Photo by Scott Olson\/Getty Images) Driven by robust demand for its trucks and SUVs, General Motors (NYSE:GM) has expanded its U.S. market share lately. Retail sales for the automaker grew by nearly 4% last year, with the GMC, Cadillac, and Buick divisions showing particularly strong results. Last month, GM declared a significant 25% dividend increase to $0.15 per share, aligning it with that of its rival Ford Motor, and also unveiled a $6 billion stock buyback initiative. Still, its stock hasn\u2019t seen much of growth lately, down 6% this year. Also see \u2013 Time To Buy Ford Stock At $10?   At its current levels of around $50, GM stock looks undervalued, making it a potentially attractive investment opportunity. However, we believe there are several major concerns with GM stock that investors should carefully consider, despite its seemingly low valuation. We arrived at our conclusion by thoroughly analyzing GM's current valuation against its operating performance in recent years and examining both current and historical financial conditions. Our comprehensive assessment of General Motors across key parameters\u2014Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience\u2014reveals that the company demonstrates significant weaknesses in both operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, GM stock looks very cheap compared to the broader market. \u2022 General Motors has a price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 0.3 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500  \u2022 Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P\/EBIT) ratio is 4.0 compared to 24.3 for S&P 500  \u2022 And, it has a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 2.6 vs. the benchmark's 24.3 General Motors' Revenues have seen notable growth over recent years. \u2022 General Motors has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 14.0% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.3% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Its revenues have grown 9.1% from $172 Bil to $187 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Also, its quarterly revenues grew 11.0% to $48 Bil in the most recent quarter from $43 Bil a year ago (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500) General Motors\u2019 profit margins are worse than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. \u2022 General Motors' Operating Income over the last four quarters was $13 Bil, which represents a poor Operating Margin of 6.8% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500)  \u2022 General Motors' Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $20 Bil, pointing to a moderate OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 10.7% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500) General Motors' balance sheet looks weak. \u2022 General Motors' Debt figure was $131 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $52 Bil (as of 3\/21\/2025). This implies a very poor Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 252.9% (vs. 19.0% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable]  \u2022 Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $27 Bil of the $280 Bil in Total Assets for General Motors. This yields a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 9.7% (vs. 14.8% for S&P 500)  GM stock has fared much worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. \u2022 GM stock fell 53.0% from a high of $65.74 on 4 January 2022 to $30.87 on 11 July 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock is yet to recover to its pre-Crisis high  \u2022 The highest the stock has reached since then is $60.20 on 25 November 2024 and currently trades at around $50 \u2022 GM stock fell 52.4% from a high of $35.29 on 20 February 2020 to $16.80 on 18 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 October 2020 In summary, General Motors' performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: \u2022 Growth: Very Strong  \u2022 Profitability: Weak  \u2022 Financial Stability: Very Weak  \u2022 Downturn Resilience: Extremely Weak  \u2022 Overall: Weak Overall, considering its significantly undervalued price point, we believe GM presents an attractive investment opportunity. GM's electric vehicle (EV) strategy is showing promising results. While the company has built its recent success largely on traditional combustion engine vehicles, it is experiencing robust growth in its EV sales. In 2024, GM secured its position as the second-largest player in the EV market with 12% market share, trailing only Tesla. Notably, GM's market share doubled over the past year. Tesla continues to maintain leadership in the U.S. EV market, while Chinese manufacturers are steadily gaining ground by offering compelling combinations of advanced technology and competitive pricing. Although GM achieved an impressive 50% surge in EV sales last year, these vehicles still represent only approximately 8% of its total U.S. sales volume, indicating significant room for growth in this segment. While GM stock looks promising, investing in a single stock can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"Business Insider Edition  Tesla's fierce battle to remain the world's top EV company has just hit another roadblock.          On Monday, Chinese EV giant BYD reported annual revenues of 777 billion yuan for 2024. At current exchange rates, that equates to roughly $107 billion. By contrast, Tesla's annual revenue last year was $97.7 billion.               BYD's net profit jumped 34% year-over-year to just over 40 billion yuan, equivalent to $5.55 billion at current exchange rates. That exceeded analyst expectations of $5.44 billion, though it was below Tesla's $7.1 billion 2024 profit.               BYD's sales surge has been relentless. In January, it sold nearly twice as many EVs as Tesla, which saw sales slump by 11% year-over-year.               By early December, the Chinese carmaker had already surpassed its annual target, selling over 3.7 million cars in 11 months \u2014 eclipsing its 3.6 million goal with a month to spare. Ultimately, it sold 4.27 million EVs in 2024.               Tesla, meanwhile, suffered its first annual sales decline in more than a decade. It delivered 1.79 million vehicles in 2024, down 1% from 2023's 1.81 million, despite a record-breaking 495,570 vehicle deliveries in Q4.               Adding to Tesla's woes, BYD last week unveiled super-fast 1,000 kW chargers it says can add almost 250 miles of range to an electric vehicle in five minutes \u2014 four times as powerful as Tesla's current 250 kW chargers, which Elon Musk's automaker says can add 200 miles of range in 15 minutes. Tesla plans to roll out 500 kW chargers this year.               Tesla has also had a rough start to the year. CEO Musk's aggressive cost-cutting efforts at DOGE have sparked a backlash against his EV maker, with Tesla facilities facing arson attacks, vandalism, and boycott calls across the US and Europe.               Over the past three months, Tesla stock has more than halved, and JPMorgan analysts slashed their price target\u00a0to $135.               However, the stock jumped as much as 10% on Monday, extending gains since Musk called a last-minute all-hands meeting with staff last Thursday.               BYD also faces challenges in its quest for global expansion, including protective measures like Russia's import taxes, the US' high tariffs, and EU tariffs.               BYD's executive vice president, Stella Li, told The Sunday Times of London the tariffs would have the opposite effect and \"weaken\" local industries.               Swedish EV battery maker Northvolt, once seen as Europe's hope for an EV battery manufacturer to rival Asian automakers, filed for bankruptcy earlier this month. It cited growing capital costs, geopolitical instability, supply chain disruptions, and fluctuating demand as reasons for its bankruptcy.               Li also dismissed claims that BYD enjoys unfair state subsidies and accused European automakers of lagging behind Chinese brands in innovation.               \"Our car is more stylish than any European-designed cars,\" she told the newspaper. \"Our car is more intelligent.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

But my husband saw this online the other day and decided to order it. Almost immediately, when he applied it, you could see it was starting to work. We left it on overnight, and the black is COMPLETELY GONE! It's incredible. It's 1,000% worth the (small) investment. Seriously \u2014 just buy this. It's amazing!!\" \u2014Nicole D. Get it from Amazon for\u00a0$14.99. Promising review: \"We cannot BEGIN to tell you what a lifesaver this is! We have two old fiberglass tubs with vinyl shower enclosures that, no matter what amount of scrubbing we have done with everything from bleach to cleanser to vinegar and baking soda, would NOT come clean. After I took my shower last night, I sprayed down the tub and walls. Within minutes, all the built-up water deposits, dirt, and grime began to melt away in front of my eyes. I left it on overnight, and when I got up this morning, it did not look like the same tub and shower. This product is a godsend, especially for old folks like us who have difficulty getting down on our hands and knees and scrubbing anything. More importantly, it performs as advertised. We plan on using it as part of our weekly cleanup routine. This is truly an overnight sensation!\" \u2014Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $19.39\u00a0(available in two scents).

Promising review: \"We have a rather deep mattress and added a memory foam topper, which gave our fitted sheet a real stretch to be able to securely tuck at the corners and not slip off. It would hold some of the time, but we frequently had a corner or two slip off during the night. After giving Bed Band a try our fitted sheet slipping problem is solved! The clamp design grips like iron, but the best part is the adjustable bands that allow for a quick final fit after installing the clamps. This makes for a much simpler installation, and with a product that, by its nature, needs to be removed and re-installed repeatedly (sheet washing), ease of installation is critical. Bed Bands is the clear design winner for function and ease of installation.

Not having to take the curtain off each time I change the liner has really been more satisfying than I had anticipated.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"ByFrank Holmes  ByFrank Holmes,  Contributor.  Taipei, Taiwan- July 25, 2022: The office building of Nvidia Corporation in Neihu Technology Park, ... More Taipei, Taiwan. is an American multinational technology company. I recently returned from Nvidia\u2019s GTC AI Conference in San Jose, California. This year\u2019s event was completely sold out, with an estimated 20,000 investors, engineers and business leaders in attendance. CEO Jensen Huang likes to call the annual get-together the \u201cSuper Bowl of AI,\u201d and after seeing his keynote, I understand why. Despite Nvidia\u2019s stock flashing a bearish \u201cdeath cross\u201d\u2014its 50-day moving average slipped below the 200-day moving average for the first time since January 2023\u2014the energy at the conference was electrifying. Every major industry was represented, from health care to defense, signaling that artificial intelligence is expanding at a white-knuckle clip. NVIDIA signals its first bearish death cross in two years During his approximately two-hour presentation (and he didn\u2019t use notes), Huang described a future where AI agents will transform entire industries, making businesses more efficient, aerospace and defense more advanced and markets more intelligent. In other words, if you thought ChatGPT was impressive, you haven\u2019t seen anything yet. Huang spoke extensively about \u201cagentic AI,\u201d or AI that doesn\u2019t just retrieve data but perceives, reasons and acts on your behalf. In his example, AI agents \u201ccan go to a website, interpret words and videos, maybe even play a video, learn from it, understand it\u2014and then use that new knowledge to complete its task.\u201d To understand this better, imagine you work on Wall Street. An AI agent could scan earnings reports, build models and execute trades faster than a human could. In health care, AI agents will be able to diagnose diseases, assist in surgeries and manage hospital logistics\u2014all with limited human supervision. AI agents are on their way Perhaps the biggest impact will be in aerospace and defense. Huang made a bold prediction: \u201cEverything that moves will be autonomous.\u201d This suggests a future with AI-powered drones, cybersecurity defense systems, battlefield robots and much more. The U.S. military is already testing AI systems that can independently identify threats and make tactical, split-second decisions in real-time. As I shared with you last month, the global AI market in aerospace and defense is projected to surge from approximately $28 billion today to $65 billion by 2034, according to one research firm. That\u2019s a solid 9.91% compound annual growth rate. North America alone represents $10.43 billion of this market, and it\u2019s growing even faster at 10.02% annually. AI in aerospace and defense market size, estimated Under President Trump\u2019s administration, there\u2019s been a concerted effort to boost American leadership in AI. One such initiative is the Stargate Project, a collaborative venture involving OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and MGX, which aims to invest up to $500 billion in AI infrastructure across the U.S. by 2029. Aligning with this vision, Nvidia has unveiled plans to invest hundreds of billions of dollars in U.S.-based manufacturing over the next four years. The move seeks to reduce reliance on Asian supply chains, particularly in light of tariff uncertainties. Speaking to the Financial Times last week, Huang remarked that, over the next four years, Nvidia will buy \u201cprobably half a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of electronics in total.\u201d He added that he can see the company \u201cmanufacturing several hundred billion of it here in the U.S.\u201d Even with all the excitement, Nvidia\u2019s stock has formed a death cross, a technical pattern that typically signals near-term weakness. But let\u2019s put things in perspective. After meteoric runs in 2023 (when it was up 238%) and 2024 (up 171%), some consolidation is natural, if history is any guide. Also, every Magnificent 7 stock, except Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, is underperforming the S&P 500 year-to-date. Magnificent 7 stocks vs. the S&P 500 I believe these dips can present buying opportunities. Nvidia\u2019s fundamentals remain incredibly strong. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported record revenue of $39.3 billion and record data center revenue of $35.6 billion. It also reported record full-year revenue of $130.5, more than double the amount generated just a year earlier. Sitting in the audience at Nvidia\u2019s GTC Conference, I could feel the same energy that surrounded the dot-com boom, the rise of mobile computing and the emergence of cloud technology. Despite near-term market fluctuations, the investment case for AI remains rock solid. It\u2019s clear to me that companies that build AI, use AI or enable AI infrastructure will shape the global economy in the decades to come.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"BYD\u2019s (BYDDY) stock jumped almost 6% after the Chinese electric vehicle maker\u2019s sales and profit for 2024 topped expectations, overtaking Tesla (TSLA) in revenue. The company\u2019s full-year revenue jumped 29% from 2023 to 777 billion yuan ($107 billion). Its chief U.S. rival, Tesla, recorded revenue of $97.7 billion. BYD\u2019s profit gained 34% year over year to 40.3 billion yuan ($5.6 billion), topping the StreetAccount consensus but falling short of Tesla\u2019s $7.1 billion. BYD\u2019s net profit margin widened to 5.2% from 5.0%. BYD has entered more than 70 countries and regions, selling 1.76 million battery EVs last year. In total, it sold 4.27 million new energy vehicles \u2014 including hybrids \u2014 in 2024, well above its 3.6 million  goal. That makes it the sixth-biggest automaker in the world by unit sales, beating out Honda Motor Co. (HMC)  Tesla reported 1.79 million EV sales in 2024, down slightly from 1.81 million a year earlier, despite a record-breaking fourth quarter. It was the company\u2019s first annual sales decline in years.  BYD\u2019s strong performance may continue as the Chinese automaker continues to develop its business. Global EV sales grew 50% year-over-year last month to 1.2 million units, with about a quarter of those in China, according to data compiled by Rho Motion. BYD\u2019s NEV sales gained 164% year-over-year to 87,473 units. \u201cMuch of the growth continues to come from China which [is] seeing a pure electric renaissance this year compared to the hybrid love affair of 2024,\u201d said Rho Motion data manager Charles Lester. \u201cDespite high tariffs, their domestic brand, BYD, shows no signs of slowing down their home and international expansion.\u201d BYD last week said it had developed what it calls the \u201cSuper e-Platform,\u201d which it claims can deliver enough power to some of its vehicles to travel 292 miles within just five minutes, a tad longer than it takes to fill up a tank of gas. That outperforms rival options from rivals Tesla, Zeekr (GELYF) and Li Auto (LI).  Chairman Wang Chuanfu told Bloomberg News that BYD plans to set up 4,000 charging stations, although he didn\u2019t specify a timeline. China is already home to more than 2,000 Tesla charging stations and Nio\u2019s (NIO) extensive network of almost 2,700 fast-charging stations. BYD said last month it would include a \u201cGod\u2019s Eye\u201d feature, which includes autonomous overtaking on roads and other features, in all of its vehicles. Most rivals, including Tesla, charge extra for similar options. The Chinese company is also working with Uber on autonomous vehicles. \u2014With reporting by Josh Fellman Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"        Jordan-Marie Smith                        The city room of The New York Times is pictured on June 15, 1971. From left are Times editors James L. Greenfield, foreign editor; Max Frankel, chief Washington correspondent; and Fred P. Graham from the Times Washington bureau. Frankel went on to be the paper's top editor.                                                           \u200e\/AP                                       hide caption  Former New York Times executive editor Max Frankel, a journalist who had integral roles with the paper for nearly half a century, died on Sunday in his New York City home, the newspaper reported. He was 94. His tenure as executive editor between 1986 and 1994 led to the paper covering more city and sports news. According to a Times obituary, he also ushered in an era where diverse voices were included in the newsroom. He retired at the end of his executive editorship. Frankel joined the Times in 1957 as a reporter covering the Soviet Union. He was charged with making sense of everyday people and their experiences under communism. \"Everything that was going on in Russia at that moment was of enormous interest, even going to the market or going to the movie house,\" Frankel told NPR's Daniel Zwerdling in 1999. He mentioned how even though his reporting trip introduced him to the markets and the movie houses, his early days reporting in the Soviet Union acquainted him with leader Nikita Khrushchev more than anyone else. Khrushchev \"made it a point of showing up every two or three nights at an embassy party,\" where foreign correspondents would pepper him with questions, Frankel said. Frankel's experiences covering tough and compelling leaders didn't stop in Eastern Europe. He then went on to write stories about Fidel Castro's Cuba. In 1973, Frankel earned the Pulitzer Prize in international reporting for his coverage of President Richard Nixon's historic trip to China. He was born in Gera, Germany, on April 3, 1930, according to the Times. His family fled Nazi forces and landed in the United States in 1940. In a 1999 interview with Diane Rehm, Frankel discussed what it felt like to immigrate from his European home and to find his \"tribe\" among Jewish people in the States. \"I come here and even in the midst of all this freedom, I'm expected to fight the battle for my tribe,\" Frankel told Rehm in 1999. \"And when Israel gets in trouble, I'm expected to stand up for them whether they're right or wrong.\" In speaking with Rehm, Frankel revealed his views on objectivity in journalism.  \"The ethic of the business is objectivity and fairness to all, but the inevitable experience that we have \u2014 the childhood loves and dangers and risks \u2014 they all go into your capacity to perceive, your capacity to judge,\" he said. His 1999 memoir, The Times of My Life and My Life with the Times, features Frankel reckoning with how his own experiences might color his journalism. In the newsroom, he said he aimed to move away from the \"stenographic notes of what the president said\" and instead encouraged analysis. He did not encourage journalists to take a stance on what they believe or who they might vote for, he told Rehm. After retirement, Frankel continued to write. In 2019, the Times published a Frankel opinion piece titled \"The Real Trump-Russia Quid Pro Quo,\" where he alleged that the Trump campaign and associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin \"had an overarching deal: the quid of help in the campaign against Hillary Clinton for the quo of a new pro-Russian foreign policy, starting with relief from the Obama administration's burdensome economic sanctions.\" The Trump reelection campaign sued the Times for defamation in 2020. The Times fought the suit and it was dismissed in 2021. Frankel married twice in his life, to Tobia Brown in the 1950s and to Joyce Purnick in the late 1980s, according to his Times obituary. He is survived by his children David Frankel, Margot Frankel and Jonathan Frankel. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}

However, President Trump reportedly wants to announce rates that are effective immediately. \u201cApril 2nd is going to be liberation day for America,\u201d Trump reportedly said on Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been ripped off by every country in the world, friend and foe.\u201d He added that the tariffs will bring the U.S. \u201ctens of billions.\u201d Despite a more targeted approach, the tariffs will still largely impact major U.S. import partners, the Wall Street Journal reported. The White House reportedly now is focused on implementing tariffs on about 15% of nations with which the U.S. has an ongoing trade imbalance.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"Business Insider Edition  Carbon Arc is hoping to level the playing field.          The new company, which is the brainchild of former Point72 data wizard Kirk McKeown, aims to upend how data is sold and structured by making it cheaper and more accessible to anyone looking to use data to trade or feed AI models.               The startup, which already has dozens of vendors and buyers on the platform, launched publicly Thursday but had been building in stealth for years, ever since McKeown left billionaire Steve Cohen's Point72 in 2021.               If the company progresses as its cofounder hopes, it will eliminate one of the biggest advantages mega-funds like McKeown's old employer have: Their deep pockets.               Carbon Arc offers anyone \u2014 small asset managers, local businesses, AI bots \u2014 structured, private data at a reasonable price. Buyers, including asset managers, healthcare systems, and the NHL's Florida Panthers, purchase the datasets they want and pay by the megabyte. The total price can be less than $1, and McKeown expects that to continue to drop as more buyers come onto the platform.               The goal, in part, is \"making the competitive advantage not whether or not you can afford it\", said McKeown in an interview with Business Insider. Instead, users can focus on \"what you can do when you have it.\"               \"Who does better work with the same dataset\" will become the differentiator, he said, adding that it brings \"creativity and skill\" back to different industries.               Data budgets in the asset management industry have soared for the biggest hedge funds, with top players spending millions a year on both vanilla market data and exotic alternative data that tracks different metrics using phone geolocation data and satellite images. A survey of 60 alternative data buyers last year by consultancy Neudata found that managers, on average, were spending $1.6 million on alt data \u2014 with plans to increase their budgets.               While the elimination of trading commissions for equities has allowed individuals and niche asset managers to trade stocks cheaply, the price of data has allowed the biggest firms to hold an insurmountable information advantage.               McKeown, a tattooed alum of Harvard and MIT's Sloan School of Management, said the venture \"didn't start out this mission-driven, but it's become a little bit of that.\" He raised $55 million from investors such as former Boston Celtics co-owner Jim Pallotta's Raptor Group and former Hollywood agent Michael Kives' K5 Global.               McKeown sees the growth of AI as another area where the firm can set itself apart.               As AI models hoover up all available public data, these cutting-edge companies will need access to cheap, private data to continue to grow and learn.               McKeown believes Carbon Arc can fill that need, in part because it structures the datasets for sale on its platform in an easily digestible way.               \"We think we are a financial services business selling data structure,\" McKeown said.               His lofty goal for the company: \"Ubiquitous access to data from Carbon Arc.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

The U.S. equity benchmark is now up 4% from its six-month intraday low set March 13, though it remains 6% below its all-time high recorded in February. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.4%, or more than 590 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 2.3%, as both indexes hit their highest levels in two weeks. The rally came thanks to \u201ceasing trade war angst\u201d on Wall Street, explained Sevens Report founder Tom Essaye, referencing Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal\u2019s weekend reports that Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs set to go into effect next week will be far more focused in nature than Trump previously suggested. Further fueling the comeback was Trump\u2019s afternoon comments suggesting he may give \u201ca lot of countries breaks\u201d from his looming reciprocal tariffs. The most notable gainers during the Monday jump were the \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d big American technology stocks. Shares of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla all gained, led by Tesla\u2019s near 11% surge. Monday is on track to be Tesla\u2019s best day since Nov. 6, the day after Trump won a second term, when investors flooded into the company run by Trump deputy Elon Musk. The septet has struggled badly to open 2025 due to the more acute impact of tariffs and the rotation into safer assets, and Tesla remains the S&P\u2019s second-biggest loser year-to-date even after the early week bounce. Even after gaining 2% on Monday, Bloomberg\u2019s magnificent seven index is down about 12% in 2025. $95 billion. That\u2019s about how much market capitalization Tesla added Monday, more than twice Ford\u2019s total valuation. Musk got about $16.5 billion richer during Monday\u2019s Tesla surge, pushing his net worth to a world-leading $351 billion, according to our latest estimates. Musk\u2019s fortune is still $110 billion below its December peak. In another signal of improving risk appetite, bitcoin prices rose to their highest level since March 7, trading above $88,000. That\u2019s a roughly 15% jump from the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency\u2019s March low. Over the last two months, the stock market has been highly volatile, often swinging due to the latest developments regarding Trump\u2019s plans for his wide-sweeping tariffs. Trump said Friday the reciprocal tariffs he touts as his driving economic policy will have \"flexibility,\" as he signals that batch of tariffs will begin to roll out next Wednesday. Reciprocal tariffs seek to charge the same duty on imported goods as the same class of American goods face in the imports\u2019 countries of origin. Significant confusion about when the reciprocal tariffs will go into place and what effective rate different goods will face contributed to increased concerns the U.S. may dip into a recession, and the Federal Reserve warned last week it expects higher inflation and lower economic growth this year due to economic uncertainty.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"ByAkash Khurana  ByAkash Khurana,  Forbes Councils Member.  Akash Khurana is the Executive Vice President and Chief Information and Digital Officer at Wesco International.   Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming supply chain management, allowing companies to turn data into meaningful action across their operations. At Wesco, we\u2019re utilizing data-driven AI across our entire enterprise to improve processes and empower our sales team to be more customer-focused. It\u2019s a profound statement given the history of the company. Wesco is a leading provider of business-to-business distribution, logistics services and supply chain solutions. Our three strategic business units serve the electrical and electronics industries; utilities and broadband industries; and communication, security and data center businesses. We are transforming into a technology-driven service organization operating at the intersection of global supply chains. Growth through acquisition has long been a business strategy for Wesco, leaving us with a large mix of various technologies. The infrastructure is massive, and it presents quite a few integration challenges. We consider AI automation a critical component in our digital transformation initiative, which helps things run more smoothly while driving stronger results across sales, inventory and customer service. Here\u2019s a little bit about how we\u2019ve approached AI and what companies considering similar investments can take away from everything we\u2019ve learned thus far. Inventory management is central to any supply chain organization\u2019s ability to operate efficiently. As disruptions become more frequent, real-time data becomes essential for balancing stock levels with demand fluctuations. Keeping this in mind, we built our \u201cInventory Command Center\u201d (ICC), implementing a centralized platform that integrates data from across our supply chain and provides visibility into inventory levels, stock movement and demand forecasting. Using AI within the ICC, we can quickly adjust our stock levels and purchasing decisions based on real-time conditions\u2014meaning we don\u2019t have to rely on historical data that may not have been accurate in the first place and is irrelevant to today\u2019s market conditions. In addition to inventory management, we\u2019ve also been extending data-driven AI to our sales teams through a new CRM system called our \u201cUnified Sales Desk.\u201d A proprietary platform, the desk gives inside and outside sales representatives a single view of the customer. More importantly, its AI capabilities make it possible to analyze important data points\u2014like inventory, pricing and customer history\u2014and offer predictive insights to better inform customer interactions. The goal is to ensure that every one of our more than 8,000 sales representatives will have the most timely and relevant information at their fingertips, allowing them to respond to customer inquiries and anticipate their needs more effectively. Our sales teams can also quickly identify cross-sell and up-sell opportunities based on data-driven insights, enhancing customer experience and fostering long-term relationships. Focusing on foundational practices is key for organizations looking to scale AI effectively. Here are some principles we learned from our journey: 1. Secure core processes. Before implementing AI applications, establish strong data governance and make sure core processes are solid. Know where your digital assets are. Trustworthy, high-quality data will support your AI initiatives over the long term. 2. Prioritize process alignment over full integration. Instead of focusing on systems transformation or complete systems integration, start smaller with process integration and process alignment. This will provide a straightforward roadmap for what\u2019s possible, avoid wasting potentially millions of dollars in the wrong areas and help you implement AI without too many disruptions. 3. Focus on real-time data for agility. With supply chains in constant flux, real-time data can be the difference between sinking or swimming. Investing in systems that provide live updates has been invaluable in managing shifts in demand and ensuring timely responses to supply chain changes. 4. Use customer-centric AI solutions. To get the most from AI, consider how it can enhance customer experiences. Tools like the Unified Sales Desk, for example, help our team to serve customers more effectively by providing quick, data-backed insights. 5. Develop cross-functional AI teams. AI success requires collaboration across functions. Having a team that combines data science with operational expertise can help ensure that AI solutions are practical and aligned with business goals. For supply chain companies, adopting AI is not just about upgrading technology; it\u2019s about building a system that can evolve with market conditions. By staying focused on how AI can make core processes more efficient, we\u2019re gradually shifting toward a model where data truly drives decision making. For other organizations considering AI, starting with targeted, practical applications and building from there can help ensure that AI becomes an integral, reliable part of business strategy.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"ByBrendan Ahern  ByBrendan Ahern,  Senior Contributor.  CLN Asian equities were mixed overnight in a quiet session following Friday\u2019s global index rebalance and the expiration of U.S. futures and options. Hong Kong and India, which has picked up recently after its correction, outperformed while the Philippines and Indonesia underperformed. The Wall Street Journal is reporting Trump\u2019s April 2 tariff announcements will be more targeted, which makes sense to me as it allows for a great headline without cratering the U.S. economy and stock market. Auto giant BYD (1211 HK, 002594 CH) reported Q4 and 2024 financial results after the close in Hong Kong and Mainland China that beat analyst expectations. The company forecasted 2025 sales between 5 million and 6 million units, according to Bloomberg. With a market cap of $157 billion, you could buy 5 BYDs using Tesla\u2019s current market cap of $799 billion. Hong Kong\u2019s market was flat until a late-day surge pushed the Hang Seng Index up to just below the 24,000 level after hitting a 52-week high last Wednesday and the Hang Seng Tech Index, which hit a 52-week high last Tuesday. The Hong Kong correction \u201cfeels\u201d dramatic, but, after a strong move, a breather is warranted. Hong Kong-listed internet stocks had a good day, led by Hong Kong\u2019s most heavily traded stocks by value, Tencent, which gained +0.29%, Alibaba, which gained +1.61% as Ant Group announced its AI does not use U.S. semiconductors, Xiaomi, which gained +4.2% though after the close announced they will raise $5.3 billion to fund their EV push, Meituan, which fell -1.13% after Friday\u2019s results, a head scratcher to me, and BYD, which gained +3.10% in advance of today\u2019s post-close results. Breadth and volume were both off while mainland investors only bought $325 million worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs today. Trump\u2019s tariffs have the potential to sideline investors. Short-video platform Kuaishou (1024 HK) will report Q4 earnings tomorrow. Mainland China had a choppy session on lighter volumes and poor breadth. Premier Li gave the keynote speech at the China Development Forum in Beijing, which was focused on addressing foreign investor concerns and continued opening up. Apple\u2019s Tim Cook was in China for the event and was in the front row for the official photograph, which is covered further below. Tourism stocks had a good day in advance of next Friday\u2019s \u201cTomb Sweeping Day\u201d, aka \u201cChing Ming Festival.\" The Ministry of Finance released a long report on fiscal policy, which should be more \u201cproactive.\" It said all the right things, though it clearly didn\u2019t have a market impact. I\u2019ll give it a full read tomorrow, as it is a long report. There has been a fair amount of chatter on copper based on a Bloomberg article, but in Mainland China, there is talk of Trump\u2019s tariff on copper imports. Reuters and the Associated Press may have been the only Western media outlets to report on Pro-Trump Republican Montana Senator Steve Daines\u2019 meetings with Premier Li on Sunday and Vice Premier He Lifeng on Saturday. Daines, a former Proctor & Gamble executive who worked in Hong Kong and Guangzhou in the 1990s, was joined by the CEOs of Qualcomm, Pfizer, Cargill, and Boeing, in advance of the China Development Forum. It is worth noting that only the U.S. executives were given the one-on-one with Premier Li. According to Reuters, the meeting with Vice Premier He, \u201cChina\u2019s economy tsar,\" focused on fentanyl and the trade deficit. Reuters reported this morning that the world\u2019s largest steel producer, China Baowu Steel Group\u2019s subsidiary Xinjiang Ba Yi Iron and Steel, will cut production by 10% \u201cafter Beijing earlier stated its intent to curb capacity in an industry long plagued by overcapacity.\u201d Maybe the Chinese government should do something to limit overcapacity in steel, solar, and EVs in a concession to Trump? The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes diverged to close +0.91% and +1.72%, respectively, on volume that decreased -31.26% from Friday, which is 141% of the 1-year average; 232 stocks advanced while 241 stocks declined. Main Board short turnover decreased -25.12% from Friday, which is 158% of the 1-year average, as 17% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers\u2019 ETF hedging). Large caps and momentum outperformed value, growth, and small caps. All sectors were positive, except for Health Care, which fell -1.11%, led by Information Technology, which gained +3.03%, Materials, which gained +2.95%, and Consumer Discretionary, which gained +1.28%. The top-performing subsectors were non-ferrous metals, household appliances, and consumer services. Meanwhile, construction, telecom services, and healthcare equipment were among the worst-performing subsectors. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were light as Mainland investors bought a net $325 million worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, including Meituan, BYD, Xiaomi, and Kuaishou. Meanwhile, Tencent, Alibaba, Xpeng, China Mobile, and Semiconductor were small net sells through the program. Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board diverged to close +0.15%, -0.66%, and +0.29%, respectively, on volume that decreased -6.44% from Friday, which is 121% of the 1-year average. 974 stocks advanced, while 4,099 stocks declined. Value, momentum, and large caps outperformed growth and small caps. The top-performing sectors were Materials, which gained +1.01%; Consumer Discretionary, which gained +0.84%; and Information Technology, which gained +0.59%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Real Estate, which fell -1.06%, and Health Care, which fell -0.66%. The top-performing subsectors were catering, tourism, marine shipping, and base metals. Meanwhile, forest industry, education, and household products were among the worst-performing subsectors. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were above average. CNY fell and the Asia Dollar Index posted a small gain versus the U.S. dollar. Treasury bond prices rose. Copper fell, and steel rose.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"Nothing drives down a drug\u2019s price like competition. According the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a drug\u2019s wholesale price drops by an average of 39% after just one generic competitor enters the market. With four generic competitors, prices tumble by 79%. These reductions translate into billions of dollars in savings for American consumers. But before generics can hit the market, a drug\u2019s patent must first expire. In the United States, drug patents last for 20 years from the date a patent application is filed, giving the pharmaceutical company that holds the patent the ability to set the drug\u2019s price without competition during this time. Here are some key drug patents expiring soon. 2 \/ 10 Patents for Merck\u2019s (MRK) cancer drug Keytruda are set to expire in 2028, potentially resulting in more competition and lower prices. But in 2024, Keytruda was once again the best-selling drug in the world. Sales of the medication rose 18% to $29.5 billion last year. 3 \/ 10 The U.S. patent for Eli Lilly\u2019s (LLY) pre-Ozempic GLP-1 drug Trulicity is set to expire in 2027. The drug was first approved by the FDA in 2014 and is used to help control blood sugar levels and help with heart health in people with type 2 diabetes. In 2024, Trulicity was one of the company\u2019s best selling drugs, generating over $5 billion in revenue. Its current list price is $987 a month. 4 \/ 10 The patent for Pfizer\u2019s (PFE) breast cancer drug Ibrance \u2014 first approved by the FDA in 2016 \u2014 expires in 2027. It was one of Pfizer\u2019s best-performing drugs in 2024, generating $4.3 billion in sales. The cost for 21 capsules of Ibrance is over $15,000. 5 \/ 10 The blood thinner Eliquis was Bristol Myers Squibb\u2019s (BMY) top revenue-generating medication last year. It brought in $9.6 billion in sales in 2024. Bristol Myers Squibb doesn\u2019t expect to lose exclusive rights to the drug until 2026. However, it is also one of the 10 drugs that are subject to Medicare price negotiations. For Medicare beneficiaries, its list price went down 56% to $231, from a list price of $521 6 \/ 10 The blockbuster drug Farxiga was approved by the FDA in 2014 to treat type 2 diabetes and has since gained indications for heart failure and chronic kidney disease. AstraZeneca (AZN) reported $7.7 billion in sales for Farxiga in 2024. Its patents expire this year. 7 \/ 10 Bristol Myers Squibb and Ono Pharmaceutical\u2019s Opdivo, a treatment for melanoma and other cancers, generated $9;3 billion in global sales. In 2024, the melanoma-fighting medication alone accounted for nearly 20% of the company\u2019s $45 billion in annual revenue. Its patent expires in 2028. 8 \/ 10 Bayer (BAYRY) and Johnson & Johnson\u2019s (JNJ) Xarelto is a blood thinner used to treat and prevent blood clots.  The drug generated $2.3 billion in sales in 2024. The main Xarelto patent expired this February. The FDA approved the first generic version of the drug this month. 9 \/ 10 Sales of Novo Nordisk\u2019s (NVO) diabetes medication Ozempic, known for its weight-loss side effects, grew 26% to $16.7 billion in 2024. The popular medication is among the drugs that will be subject to Medicare price negotiations this year. Its U.S. patent expires in 2032. 10 \/ 10","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"As attributed to Paul Samuelson. So, with trepidation, I show the SP500 and CAPE over the last half decade:   Figure 1: SP500 (blue, left scale), CAPE (tan, right scale). NBER defined peak-to-trough recession dates shaded gray. Source: Shiller, NBER. Even including todays rebound, the SP500 looks like a substantial decline. And what are movements in the SP500 associated with (in addition to interest rates, VIX):  Figure 2: SP500 close (blue, left log scale), EPU (pink, right scale). Source: FRED, policyuncertainty.com. \u00a0 The mid-expansion decline in stocks was in response to higher interest rates \u2013 the whole risk-adjusted equilibration of asset returns thing. We have already marveled at the economy\u2019s resilience to contractionary monetary policy and the accompanying loss of wealth. These days, the decline in stocks is not, mathematically, driven by an increase in returns by lowering stock prices. Instead, expected returns have fallen, so prices have fallen in response. In fact, the drop in market interest rates means that stock prices don\u2019t have to fall quite as far to maintain equivalence between returns on debt and equity.  Setting aside the questionable record of stocks as a recession predictor, what else is there to learn from the drop in equity prices? The wealth effect is reduced, and it is the wealthy who have been driving consumer demand most strongly since the labor market cooled off. Capital investment is likely to weaken in response to the decline in expected returns. Between the wealth effect and weaker capital investment, two of the components of GDP are looking shakey.  So we don\u2019t need to look only at the binary question of recession in order to use stocks to assess the economic outlook. Yes of course, the stock market is too volatile to the downside. But it\u2019s in the Index of Leading Indicators for a good reason. If it keeps making new highs, with the \u2013  ahem \u2013 notable exception of 1929, you are not having a recession. Almost always, more or less coincident with the onset of recession, the stock market is down YoY. If you pair it with initial claims YoY, specifically whether the 4 week average is higher by 10% or more YoY, you get a very easy and near flawless indicator. FRED no longer has permission to post historical stock market data, but I believe this simple indicator has been flawless since at least the turn of the Millennium. And it is based on fundamentals, with one side measuring the production side of the economy, and the other the consumption (jobs and wages) part. FRED still carries the NASDAQ back to the mid-1970s and yep, your rule still works: https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/graph\/?g=1FGVE  I stopped before Covid because it smashes everything down so you can\u2019t tell what\u2019s going on.

Thanks. \u201cHe wrote Economics: an Introductory Analysis in 1948, a text which was regularly revised and continued to stay in common use, going through 17 editions. In the 1961, seventh edition of his text, Samuelson noted that, at that time, the U.S.S.R. had a gross national product (GNP) which was approximately half that of the U.S. According to Alex Tabarrok, Samuelson projected that, because of higher levels of investment driving faster economic growth, Soviet GNP would outpace that of the United States, perhaps as soon as 1984, but no later than 1997.\u201d https:\/\/www.thevintagenews.com\/2018\/08\/23\/soviet-gnp\/ This falls directly in line with: https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/quotes\/261863-it-s-tough-to-make-predictions-especially-about-the-future Samuelson wrote millions of words about economics, and made who knows how many predictions. I\u2019m not clear on why you think this bit about Soviet growth is relevant here. Please enlighten us. By the way, the idea that the Soviet economy would grow larger than the U.S. economy was entirely conventional during the third quarter of the 20th century. Heck, the CIA expected the Soviet Union to outgrow the U.S. Right-wingers like to crow about Samuelson, while neglecting to mention that many right-wing economists agreed with him. Perhaps the most prominent economists to realize that Soviet growth could not keep pace with the U.S., much less catch up and surpass the U.S., was Walt Rostow, advisor to Kennedy and Johnson. I mean, if we\u2019re keeping score, then let\u2019s keep score. If you\u2019re just parroting right-wing spin meant to dirty up Samuelson\u2019s reputation, well, same old Brucie. S&P 500 is about 20% overvalued based on median CAPE and dividend yields. A rudimentary Fed Model (differential between earnings yield and 10 year yield) predicts exactly the same thing.  On the other hand, real S&P earnings have not started to drop yet as of last week, which almost always accompanies a correction. So I think the Wile E Coyote moment will last a few more months, at least until Q1 earnings start coming in. used to be a musk fan, but as I learn more about him my opinion continues to deteriorate.  just read an interesting article by will lockett (who\u2019m I have read vary rarely, but have seen before).  everybody praises musk and space x.  but space x has exploded 7 major rockets in its quest to get large payload starship into orbit.  it has not yet done so, and its supposed deadline to get this done has swished on past us.  and currently it has announced that its payload will now only be half of what was predicted, because its components cannot handle the original payload forces.  seven blown up starships, and still not a single success.  now musk claims genius and is this beacon of efficiency change.  and very critical of nasa.  well 50 YEARS AGO, nasa put the equivalent of starship into orbit and on the moon.  and they did it without blowing up a single Saturn rocket.   Elon, you are no nasa.  and it makes you wonder who is actually willing to sit in that starship commanders seat, while Elon cuts corners to save cash at your explosive expense?  so anybody who is buying the Elon doge genius malarkey needs to consider whether they would sit in that rocket seat, considering the preponderance of failure so far achieved Elon.  Elon cannot seem to accomplish what nasa did 50 years ago with slide rules and digital calculators.  food for thought. \u201cElon, you are no nasa.\u201d True. NASA and Boeing left two astronauts stranded for months in their version of Gilligan\u2019s Island. Musk\u2019s SpaceX has been developing revolutionary rockets and not afraid of early failures. Obviously, they\u2019ve learned from the failures and now are uniquely positioned with reusable rockets and quick turn-around times\u2026 something NASA and Boeing can only dream about. The two astronauts said, \u201cElon, you are no nasa. Thank goodness.\u201d https:\/\/orbitaltoday.com\/2025\/03\/24\/spacex-450th-falcon-9-rocket-launch-sets-a-new-record\/ I\u2019m amused by those whose opinions of Musk have shifted 180\u00ba because he is now involved in trying to make government more efficient and less wasteful. Suddenly he is just a fraud. To them I say pick the reasons you hate Musk: 1) creating and popularizing Tesla EVs which were aligned with saving the planet by replacing fossil fuel vehicles. 2) creating and expanding Starlink satellite communications which were instrumental in restoring communications and internet to Ukraine. 3) creating and improving SpaceX which just brought back stranded astronauts when NASA and Boeing couldn\u2019t get the job done 4) creating the Boring Company which has reduced the time and cost of tunnel infrastructure development. 5) creating and developing Neuralink that holds the promise of restoring autonomy to disabled people. 6) Volunteering his time and the expertise of his top software people to identify and eliminate the waste and inefficiency that has contributed to a $36 trillion national debt. 7) Being a legal immigrant. Joe Biden had a visionary program: https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/2024\/09\/04\/biden-broadband-program-swing-state-frustrations-00175845 Elon Musk already delivered in Ukraine. I\u2019ll bet that $42 billion could provide a lot of Starlink rural high speed internet\/communications in the US\u2026 and it wouldn\u2019t involve years of laying cable through the wilderness. [#governmentefficiency] Bruce Hall  Musk\u2019s problem isn\u2019t that he isn\u2019t smart enough; it\u2019s that he thinks he\u2019s the smartest guy in the room regardless of the subject.  Musk obviously has a strong engineering mind with a lot of businessman energy.  He\u2019s been very successful at many of the things he\u2019s tried.  But he\u2019s also been spectacularly unsuccessful in other things; e.g., marriage and interpersonal skills.  You\u2019ve really got to work at it to go through three wives in less than a decade.  His intelligence matches his personality\u2026quite lopsided.  When it comes to government efficiency he\u2019s simply way out of his depth.  For example, as a businessman he\u2019s likely to think that cutting costs is always efficient, but businessmen often don\u2019t realize the difference between cost cutting and cost shifting.  To them the effect on the private bottom line is the same.  In government you have to be sensitive to the difference.  He also has a cramped understanding of efficiency.  There\u2019s a difference between making the government more efficient (less inputs for the same output) and making the macroeconomy more efficient.  Musk is focused on the former and seems oblivious when it comes to the latter.  Firing government workers might or might not make the government more efficient, but if those workers are unable to find private sector jobs that yield a value of marginal product that is at least equal to the value of marginal product in their government jobs, then the macroeconomy is operating less efficiently.  And it\u2019s the macroeconomy that counts, not the government sector in isolation.  That\u2019s called suboptimization, something that in my personal experience is a common affliction among private sector managers.  Musk also shares another trait common among megalomaniacs.  When shown that he\u2019s simply wrong on an objective fact (e.g., the age of SS retirees), he refuses to admit error.  Instead, he doubles down and tries to retaliate against those who would dare to correct him.  His ego is simply too fragile to accept the fact that he\u2019s not omniscient.  Then again, he shares that same trait with another megalomaniac. Sorry, you are trying to sane-wash Elon by critiquing his efficiency skills.  By discussing \u201cefficiency\u201d you are taking it at face value that Elon\u2019s efforts have anything to do with efficiency.  That\u2019s just the cover story.  The real aim is the total dismantling of anything that Elon disapproves of as being \u201cwoke\u201d or DEI or gendered or Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal.  It\u2019s all right there in Project 2025.  All that stuff about fraud or inefficiency in Social Security is a lie.  The real goal is the destruction of Social Security.  He wants to privatize everything from the Post Office to the Weather Service to Air Traffic Control to Veterans Affairs.  It has nothing to do with \u201cefficiency.\u201d I\u2019m quite aware that Trump\u2019s real goal is to shutter the government and take revenge on the country.  Hey, I spent a career as a civil servant!!!  My point was that even on its own terms what Musk is doing is inefficient\u2026even if you want to take him at his word that it\u2019s all about efficiency.  In Musk\u2019s case I think a lot of his actions come from some perverse and immature glee that he gets from hurting people.  You could almost see the dopamine when he was wielding that chainsaw. BTW,  Starlink is VERY expensive\u2026much more expensive than fiber optic cable.  And it\u2019s quite slow and has never achieved its benchmark speed: https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/home\/internet\/starlink-doubled-its-users-in-2024\/ And when it comes to that $42B infrastructure money, Musk is right there at the trough arguing for Starlink to get some of the money.  As to government efficiency, laying fiber optic cable is a private sector thing, not the government.  And that $36T debt wasn\u2019t caused by government inefficiency; it was caused by politicians who couldn\u2019t resist tax cuts for conservative voters who want lots of goodies but don\u2019t want to pay for any of them. Remember that the Starlink infrastructure is already in place. The additional cost is for the terminals for each user. If users chose cable, they would still have to rent\/buy modems plus any installation costs and then would incur monthly fees as well. Cellular service is a nice alternative if you can get it. My T-Mobile downloads average about 500 Mbps dowloads and about 100 Mbps uploads which easily handles all my smart devices plus streaming services. My son\u2019s fiber optic line is a little better, but no noticeable difference in performance. Satellite service will be slower, but still sufficient for most users. 2023: https:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/news\/starlink-speed-tests-2023-vs-2022 2025: https:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/articles\/from-dc-to-doha-i-put-starlink-wi-fi-to-the-test-on-a-12-hour-flight Most homes can get by with 30Mbps. Most corporations are not located in remote areas and if they are they can afford to pay for satellite service. If you are in the middle of Alaska and willing to wait 10-20 years for cable services, then just use your carrier pigeon until then (or, ironically, your satellite phone). If the government is willing to spend $42 billion for cable services to remote areas, then subsidizing some low-income users for Starlink would be much less costly and actually achieve some service before 2050. Otherwise, financially capable people can pay like everyone else. If you choose to live near Mt. McKinley, then don\u2019t expect the level of services you receive in Seattle. As for the recent rise in national debt, it is a combination of too little revenue for way too much spending.  MIT Sloan Business School estimated that 40+% of 2021-22 inflation was caused by excessive government spending which then led to the Fed raising its funds rates which then led to interest service on the national debt exceeding the military budget which then led to higher national debt. See a pattern here? The good news is that tariffs, basically a consumption tax, will put more revenue into the Treasury to help offset some of that excessive spending. Of course, nobody likes new taxes so this will be roundly panned. Better to have the top 1% of income earners pay 75% of total federal income taxes instead of the current 46% rather than a general consumption tax on inports. We all like free internet and free stuff (paid for by others). \u201cBetter to have the top 1% of income earners pay 75% of total federal income taxes instead of the current 46% rather than a general consumption tax on inports.\u201d Glad you agree with standard economics, for once: https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0047272708000248 Given the declining marginal utility of income, downward redistribution of income increases utility. That is to say, taxing the rich and providing income support to the poor (along with services to everyone) absolutely improves welfare. Our government was formed \u201cto promote the general welfare\u201d, so I assume no true patriot would object to efforts to do so. Taxing the top 1% at a 75% marginal rate would leave them with after-tax income above $200,000. Mercedes, yes. Yatch? Probably not, but the children of rich and poor alike could have enough food. \u201cI\u2019m amused by those whose opinions of Musk have shifted 180\u00ba because he is now involved in trying to make government more efficient and less wasteful.\u201d Brucie, you mind-reader! In fact you\u2019re playing mind-reader twice over. You pretend to know what Musk is trying to do so that you can pretend to know why people have changed their minds about him. Same old Brucie, makin\u2019 stuff up. Yes, Musk is involved in lots of businesses. And like any good sycophant, you give Musk credit for doing wonders with them. Let\u2019s not ignore one very obvious reason that some folks have changed their minds about Musk: his businesses aren\u2019t the wonders he pretends they are.  Oh, and about that \u201clegal immigrant\u201d thing \u2013 didn\u2019t Musk violate his student visa status, thereby becoming an illegal immigrant, before he jumped the line to get legal status?  Your hero worship of racists and rapists is a thing to behold, Brucie. Duckie, your envy is palpable. Musk was your hero until he went to the \u201cDark Side\u201d, right? (Dark Side is defined as not supporting a progressive\/socialist agenda). \u201cPalpable\u201d? Keep your hands to yourself,  Brucie! You\u2019re doubling down on mind reading with that \u201cpalpable \u201cstuff, so thanks for proving my point. You don\u2019t have a legitimate argument to make, so you\u2019re leaning into to fake mind-reader stuff.  I\u2019ve never had much use for Musk, contrary to your self-serving speculation. He got his pet Tesla board of directors to divert wealth from shareholders to his pockets. So, no, he was never a hero. And yes, I think less of him now that he has exposed his bigotry and his ineptitude as a manager. bruce, while the others here have knocked down your response admirably, let me kick this dog while he is still down as well. \u201cTrue. NASA and Boeing left two astronauts stranded for months in their version of Gilligan\u2019s Island. \u201d  false.  nasa did not strand anybody.  or you should be honest and say it was nasa and space x that rescued the stranded astronaut.  nevertheless, nasa is the adult in the room who made the safe decision to not board a leaky space capsule to return to earth.  and lest us not forget, the only reason space x has these fun toys is because of the $billions of dollars in government and NASA money it received to develop them.  I will repeat, space x exists because NASA FUNDED IT.  let that sink it, dimwit. and last I checked, those two astronauts were not dismayed one bit by being \u201cstranded\u201d in space for a few months.  that was their dream experience.  they trained for this time in space.  there were adequate supplies and facilities.  there was no suffering there.  let me repeat, these were ASTRONAUTS.  they have been dreaming of spending as much time in space as possible.  so the idea they were \u201cstranded\u201d is simply absurd, you dimwit. and a few comments on your other items.  if starlink were to disappear today, the world would still spin.  and don\u2019t forget how musk randomly cut off starlilnk access for Ukraine, in attempts to facilitate Russian advances.  as well as the Russian use of starlink in ukraine as well.  the boring company?  at best, it dug a tunnel in Las Vegas.  not what I would call a successful and impactful company.  there is more to underground construction than digging the dirt, bruce.  musk has no handle on that aspect.  and doge?  musk is not working with the government for the greater good.  he is targeting parts of the government for the benefit of his companies.  tariffs on his competitors.  gutting of government contracts that compete with spacex.  and soon you will see neuralink try to capture the funds resulting from the decapitation of the formerly most advanced medical research program the world had ever seen, at NIH.  bruce, I cannot believe one person could be so ignorant about musk and the world. and I was a musk supporter until a couple of years ago, when I learned just how dysfunctional a personality he actually was.  his disregard for employees is especially egregious.  so this 180 was not a result of recent politics-although his recent actions provide ample evidence of why people should not be a supporter of him.  he has displayed an unethical and immoral attitude, combined with selfish aspirations, that are not a positive for the world.  which is unfortunate.  at one time, I had high hopes for him. Bruce: \u201cBetter to have the top 1% of income earners pay 75% of total federal income taxes instead of the current 46% rather than a general consumption tax on inports.\u201d Sounds good to me!  Now you\u2019ve got it. Just the opposite, the Trump plan is to have both a consumption tax that falls most heavily on lower income households and couple that with lavish tax cuts for the rich.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"Careless People is a very enjoyable book, and, depending on who you talk to (and presumably based on how much Meta stock they still own), people with knowledge of the events in the book either strongly agree with author Sarah Wynn-Williams or they say she\u2019s full of shit. But in the course of her scathing assessment of building one of the most dangerous and powerful political tools in history, she also did something magical: She made me like Sheryl Sandberg. As a woman, I know it is offensive to say I never much cared for Sheryl Sandberg, the former COO of Meta and the person everyone agrees made the company a monstrous success. I was there in the early 2010s when \u201cI went to a live reading of Lean In\u201d was a bragging right amongst professional women who were all eager to prove that they too had the stuff to build something ambitious while never fully joining the boy\u2019s club. Like a vision out of 1980s Hollywood, Sandberg was a working woman, decked out in stylish power suits, with a platoon of assistants and a loving family, too, and she sold this promise to a lot of other women with much smaller paychecks and far fewer assistants. I always thought Sandberg\u2019s bit was too much. Her victory lap as a supreme Girl Boss felt baldly like a tool to market her book instead of a philosophy she lived by. She seemed to project an image where every flaw was carefully chosen to further the story of womanhood she was selling. It felt like just another iteration on the deeply annoying and offensive adage \u201ca woman can have it all.\u201d And then I read about her desperate attempts to get clout online by claiming to have nearly been a passenger on a flight that crash landed, or using a work trip as an opportunity to promote her book and take the family on vacation, and she felt scandalously human. Through revealing anecdotes about her desperation and greed, she finally felt like one of us, instead of some sort of totem for working women. Wynn-Williams\u2019 Sandberg is a fragile creature who can be kind and sharp and capricious and cruel. Like this excerpt from the day she met then Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe: I may have already been looking for evidence to confirm my sense of foreboding but when I arrive at Sheryl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suite at the Ritz-Carlton the morning of the meeting, I see a stunningly beautiful Japanese woman, perfectly made up and stylishly dressed, quietly crying outside it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAre you okay?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I ask tentatively. She nods. The tears streaming down her cheeks somehow make her even more impossibly lovely. At that moment Debbie comes bundling out of Sheryl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suite and pulls me close. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go in there.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhy?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou were going to go in there, weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cUm, yeah\u00e2\u0080\u0094what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cMajor issue with the makeup and hair.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs that who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crying outside the door? The makeup artist?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, yeah. The makeup was a disaster and let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not mention the hair. I mean, I think it was basically fine, but Sheryl hated it and some of her instructions were lost in translation and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all come to a head.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOr on her head?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I try to pun. Debbie ignores it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh god. Is it a cultural thing?\u00e2\u0080\u009d I ask. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLike was the makeup artist doing what she thinks Western women want? Quite eighties? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still really early. Can you get someone else?\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cAh, that was the someone else. She already fired the first makeup artist.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cOuch. She made her cry too? Okay, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m guessing a third makeup artist isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t going to happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cNo, I think she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to do it herself, but this does not bode well for the day ahead.\u00e2\u0080\u009d This is a side of Sheryl I have not seen before. In this exchange, we don\u2019t even see Sandberg, but we can already see she\u2019s nervous\u00e2\u0080\u0094as anyone would be meeting a head of state. And when she\u2019s nervous, she\u2019s mean. The rest of the chapter retells the meeting, as well as Sandberg\u2019s desperation to get a photo of the Prime Minister holding her book. It reads like a farce of powerful women in business, and I\u2019ll admit to thinking Wynn-Williams was exaggerating. But here\u2019s that photo of Sandberg and Shinzo Abe. You can see her glee. You can see his amused confusion. You can see she posted this image after he was assassinated as proof that she once met him. And all of that, while not the image Sandberg seeks to convey, makes her so much more likable. The book gets darker and darker as it goes on and Wynn-Williams realizes just how awful the ramifications of Facebook\u2019s growth-at-all-costs mentality are. But having lived through it all and watching just how terrible Meta\u2019s impact would be on democracy, I found something charming in Sandberg\u2019s humanity. Sure, she might have helped set up the fall of more than one nation, but she really was just a woman trying to do her best.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"When you're paying rent to your landlord, it's pretty much like putting a stack of cash in the trash every week. That money is gone, and you have nothing to show for it. Don't it wrong, that really stinks, but you can't just decide one day that the house is actually yours, even though you've been paying off the landlord's mortgage for them. Landlords argue they offer a \"service\" and it's debatable whether or not this id really true. If you're renting out your home while life has taken you elsewhere or maybe it's your second home that you once lived in previously, then this could be a legitimate line of argument. Especially if the person you're renting to also owns a home But, still, it's crazy to think that some people (and private equity firms) own dozens of homes, land banking massive amounts of properties, throwing them on Airbnb or renting them out and driving up both rental prices and the property market like it's an actual ethical business. It's right there in the name: lord. It's a feudal system designed for one specific purpose and the end result is that most people get priced out of the housing market and are stuck renting and burning cash for longer. Still, that doesn't mean that you're entitled to your landlord's property like this entitled tenant \"Karen\" seemed to think she was. This classic internet story sparked a flurry of varied responses from readers when it was first shared, with readers concerned about the fact that the tenant had been allowed to remain living there long after her declaration. One might expect this family to run into further trouble from her in the future. Like what you see? Follow our WhatsApp channel for more. The image does not depict the actual subjects of the story.

MacMillan, who founded Blue Ant, will be the CEO, with Brad Martin the chairman.  \t           \t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t       \tThe reverse takeover \u2013 in which a privately-owned company buys a listed one \u2013 allows the acquirer to list on the stock market without holding a traditional IPO. The deal, based on a share price of C$2.25 per Blue Ant share, is a 125% premium on Boat Rocker\u2019s closing price on Friday.   \tAlso part of the agreement, Blue Ant will inherit three Boat Rocker producers in Canada \u2013 Insight Productions, Jam Filled Entertainment, and Proper Television, which collectively delivered C$118M in revenue in 2024, based on unaudited results.  \tBoat Rocker\u2019s other assets, including its Boat Rocker Studios business \u2013 comprising scripted, unscripted, kids and family production operations \u2013 are among other assets being divided though several transactions. Boat Rocker bosses Ivan Schneeberg, David Fortier and John Young have formed a new biz, IDJCo, to buy Boat Rocker Studios, and the brand management and franchise management operations. These will then be run by a new company operating under the Boat Rocker name.  \tThe MBO team said the new look Boat Rocker Studios would be \u201cwell capitalized and operationally focused on content creation and IP management.\u201d It will have offices in Toronto, London, LA, NYC and Hong Kong.  \t\u201cWe are excited about this opportunity to acquire Boat Rocker Studios and use the resulting enhanced strategic focus and flexibility to capitalize on the exciting content creation, investment and partnership opportunities we see in the global marketplace,\u201d said Schneeberg, Fortier, and Young in a statement.  \t           \t\u201cWe will be more agile than ever, allowing us to move faster and lean in closer to projects we believe in. We will be better positioned to invest in amazing content and better able to ensure that the projects we are part of achieve their fullest potential, both in terms of entertainment value and worldwide sales. We will continue to work tirelessly to be the best independent studio partner in the world.\u201d  \tBlue Ant is headquartered in Toronto, and has offices Los Angeles, New York, Washington, London, Sydney, and Singapore. It generated C$196M in revenues in the fiscal year ending August 31, 2024, a 16% increase year-over-year, and made C$18M in net income.  \tThe new-look Blue Ant will receive C$25.5M as a minimum cash balance and working capital, around $11.6M from The Initial Group\u2019s ownership of Boat Rocker and several other financial guarantees.   \tFairfax Financial Holdings, a Blue Ant shareholder, has agreed to support the offering through a C$20M backstop commitment, which would reduce the ownership stakes of Blue Ant and Boat Rocker shareholders if completed. It will also buy Boat Rocker\u2019s minority interest in The Initial Group for around C$17M.  \t\u201cThis is an opportunistic moment for Blue Ant to go public, paving the way for long-term value creation,\u201d said\u00a0MacMillan. \u201cWe are confident that this transaction will unlock significant value for all shareholders. Through the combination of our public listing, a strengthened balance sheet, and significant net cash post-transaction, we believe that we are strategically positioned for profitable global growth, both organically and through M&A.\u201d Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

Many other states are seeing improvements above 30%. Why is this happening?  Researchers say it may be a combination of factors, some hopeful and some painful.                                                           Spencer Platt\/Getty Images                                       hide caption  Over the past six months, I've been tracking something really cool and mysterious happening on American streets. For the first time in 30 years, drug deaths are plunging at a rate that addiction experts say is hopeful \u2014 but also baffling.  In the past, even the most ambitious, well-funded efforts to slow drug deaths only helped a little bit. Reducing fatal overdoses by 8% or 9% was seen as a huge win.  But now, deaths nationwide plunged more than 26% from the peak in June 2023, according to the latest preliminary data gathered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   That means roughly 30,000 fewer people a year are dying. Many states are seeing even bigger improvements of 30% to 50%.  In some states, progress has been sustained since 2021 and 2022, which suggests this isn't a temporary blip.  What's going on? No one knows for sure, but here are eight leading theories I hear from experts. 1.  Naloxone, also known as Narcan, may be the game-changer. The Biden administration raced to make this medication, a nasal spray that quickly reverses opioid and fentanyl overdoses, far more widely available. People can buy it now over the counter without a prescription. It's distributed for free in many high-risk communities, and people using drugs often carry it. It's unclear how many lives naloxone is saving each year, but many front-line public health workers tell me the impact is huge. Learn more here.                  Naloxone, also known as Narcan, is much easier and more affordable than ever. People who use fentanyl now regularly revive one another after experiencing overdoses. Some public health experts and activists think this medication may be a big factor shifting the tide of America's overdose crisis.                                                           Brian Mann\/NPR                                       hide caption  2.  Weaker fentanyl. Street fentanyl is incredibly potent. But in many parts of the U.S., organizations that test fentanyl doses sold by drug dealers \u2014 often in pill form \u2014 have found a significant drop in purity. No one's sure why drug cartels have changed their mixtures. Some researchers believe law enforcement pressure in China, Mexico and the U.S. is disrupting the black market fentanyl supply chain. Learn more here. 3.  A dangerous but less lethal street drug supply. In most of the the U.S., gangs are selling complicated \"cocktails\" of street drugs. The amount of fentanyl appears to be dropping (see above), while the amount of animal tranquilizers, such as medetomidine and xylazine, is rising. These chemicals are highly toxic. They cause skin wounds, severe withdrawal symptoms and other long-term health problems. But doctors and addiction experts generally agree they aren't as immediately lethal as fentanyl. That could mean more chronic illness but fewer fatal overdoses. Learn more here.                  When America's opioid crisis began in the 1990s, drug addiction treatment was rare and often came shrouded in stigma. The U.S. addiction treatment system and safety net have seen huge improvements over the past decade. Better medications are available, and in many communities, more resources are available to help people using highly dangerous drugs such as fentanyl.                                                           Brian Mann\/NPR                                       hide caption  4.  Better public health. Thirty years after the U.S. opioid crisis began \u2014 and a decade after fentanyl spread nationwide \u2014 the U.S. has made strides developing better and more affordable services for people experiencing addiction. Medications that reduce opioid cravings, including buprenorphine and methadone, are more widely available, in part because of insurance coverage provided by Medicaid. In many states, roughly $50 billion in opioid settlement money paid out by corporations is also starting to help. Going forward, it's unclear how the Trump administration's deep cuts to public health agencies and grants will affect this new addiction safety net. Learn more here. 5.  Many of the most vulnerable people have already died. This theory is discounted by some researchers I talk to, but many addiction experts think it's a factor.  Over the past five years, the U.S. has been losing roughly 110,000 people to fatal drug overdoses every year. It's possible drug deaths are declining in part because a heartbreaking number of people using fentanyl and other high-risk street drugs simply didn't survive. Learn more here. 6.   Waning effect of the COVID pandemic. The isolation, trauma and disruption of addiction treatment programs that followed the onset of COVID in 2020 overlap with the most devastating years of drug overdose deaths. Many public health experts believe the pandemic deepened the catastrophic impacts of fentanyl. According to this theory, as the impacts of COVID continue to fade, deadly overdoses are also declining to a more \"normal\" level. Learn more here. 7.  People are using fentanyl (and other high risk street drugs) more skillfully. This is a common theory among people who use street drugs. They often tell me they've adapted to the risks of fentanyl by smoking rather than injecting the drug, which many addiction experts believe is safer (though still incredibly dangerous). People try to never use fentanyl alone and often carry naloxone or Narcan to reverse overdoses. Many people use test strips to identify unwanted contaminants in their drugs and use smaller fentanyl doses. Learn more here. 8.  A decline in young people using drugs. Street fentanyl has emerged as a leading cause of death among young people in the U.S., age 18 to 45. But research suggests far fewer young people and teenagers are using drugs (other than cannabis). This trend matters because new users have low physical tolerance for opioids such as fentanyl, which means they're more likely to overdose and potentially die. Fewer young users means fewer people taking that risk. Learn more here. It's important to emphasize all of these theories are just that \u2014 theories. Most researchers, doctors and front-line care providers say they need more data and more time to understand a shift this large.   But there is a growing, tentative consensus that the answer may well be \"all of the above.\"    A big question going forward is How low will U.S. drug deaths go?  We've already seen the biggest, fastest drop in U.S. history. So far, there's no sign the improvement is slowing. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"Business Insider Edition  The chairman of Denmark's parliamentary defense committee said he regrets choosing the F-35 for his country, citing fears that the US may threaten to cease support for the fighter.          \"As one of the decision-makers behind Denmark's purchase of F-35s, I regret it,\" Rasmus Jarlov, a member of parliament for the center-right Conservative People's Party, wrote on social media on Wednesday.               Jarlov was addressing rumors that the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II may have a \"kill-switch\" that allows Washington to remotely disable F-35s purchased by US allies.               The Pentagon said on Tuesday that the stealth fighter does not have such a feature.               But the Danish MP isn't convinced. \"We obviously cannot take your word for it,\" Jarlov wrote in his post.               He added that the US could scupper Copenhagen's use of the F-35 just by stopping the supply of spare parts \u2014 a similar dilemma that Ukraine faced when Washington temporarily paused military aid.               \"I can easily imagine a situation where the USA will demand Greenland from Denmark and will threaten to deactivate our weapons and let Russia attack us when we refuse,\" wrote Jarlov, who is also his party's spokesperson for his stance on Greenland's affairs.               Jarlov further accused the US of wanting \"to strengthen Russia and weaken Europa.\"               \"Therefore, buying American weapons is a security risk that we cannot run. We will make enormous investments in air defense, fighter jets, artillery, and other weapons in the coming years, and we must avoid American weapons if at all possible,\" he said.               \"I encourage our friends and allies to do the same,\" Jarlov added.               Denmark announced in 2016 that it was spending about $3 billion on 27 F-35s to replace its aging fleet of F-16 Fighting Falcons. Jarlov was serving as Denmark's defense committee chairman at the time.               Copenhagen has received 17 of its orders so far.               In a statement to Business Insider, a Lockheed Martin spokesperson said the company \"values our enduring partnership with the Royal Danish Air Force and is committed to strengthening that partnership into the future.\"               \"The pressure-tested F-35 program recently surpassed 1 million flight hours across 16 military services flying the aircraft,\" they said.               \"We are committed to helping our customers strengthen their airpower and security with the F-35,\" they added. \"As part of our government contracts, we deliver all system infrastructure and data required for all F-35 customers to sustain the aircraft.\"               His comments come as President Donald Trump has said that he wants to buy or annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark that's rich in minerals and can provide the US with a strategic location near the Arctic.               Leaders in both Greenland and Denmark have repeatedly resisted Trump's statements, saying their governments had no interest in the territory coming under US administration or rule.               \"There is no threat from China against Greenland and China has no presence in Greenland,\" Jarlov wrote on Sunday. \"The only threat against Greenland is the USA.\"               Meanwhile, Second Lady Usha Vance, White House national security advisor Mike Waltz, and the Secretary of Energy Chris Wright are expected to visit Greenland on Thursday.               Denmark isn't the only country reconsidering its defense reliance on US exports. Leaders in Portugal and Canada have also said they are reviewing their willingness to buy the F-35 amid the geopolitical tensions between the US and its allies.               Canada's defense minister, Bill Blair, said his country may be seeking alternatives to the F-35 over concerns of hostility from Washington, which launched steep tariffs against Canadian and Mexican goods earlier this month.               Meanwhile, Portugal's outgoing defense minister, Nuno Melo, told local media that his country \"cannot ignore the geopolitical environment in our choices\" on possibly buying the F-35.               At least 19 governments, including the UK, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Canada, Australia, and Israel, have agreed to purchase the F-35.               The F-35 is one of the most advanced fighter jets in the world, and while it has several competitors, its stealth features have been dominant in the market. Other planes considered adjacent or similar in capability are China's Chengdu J-20 and the French Dassault Rafale, which a British think tank said has recently surged in popularity as US ties with its allies fray.               South Korea is also developing the KF-21 Boramae, but its stealth systems are expected to be less advanced than the F-35's.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"by Calculated Risk on 3\/24\/2025 07:34:00 PM   From Matthew Graham at Mortgage News Daily: Mortgage Rates Slightly Higher to Start New WeekThe average mortgage lender raised rates modestly on Monday morning--a logical move considering the weakness in the bond market over the weekend.  Rates are based directly on bonds. Bond \"weakness\" means investors are paying less for bonds which, in turn, means that yields (aka \"rates\") are effectively higher.  ... In the bigger picture, all of this analysis is much ado about nothing. Mortgage rates continue a very flat, narrow orbit around 6.75% for top tier conventional 30yr fixed scenarios.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"ByFred Battisti  ByFred Battisti,  Forbes Councils Member.  Fred Battisti develops and executes a companywide leasing strategy as First National Realty Partners' Chief Revenue Officer.    With robust sales and optimistic outlooks, retailers are aggressively pursuing space in grocery-anchored strip centers. These retailers specifically target shopping centers anchored by grocers, or at least shadow-anchored by a strong grocer located next to the center itself. The presence of such an anchor\u2014or shadow anchor\u2014can draw significant foot traffic to the rest of the center\u2019s tenancy, positioning these types of tenants for success. However, low vacancies and high demand are making it challenging for many brands to secure prime locations. Often, opportunities arise only when struggling retailers vacate their spaces. Many quick-service restaurants (QSR), \u201ceatertainment\u201d venues and discount and off-price retailers are seeking to expand their store footprints to meet consumer demand for budget-friendly shopping, dining and socializing. In an era of rising restaurant prices, QSRs\u2014which are known for their fast-food preparation, counter service and affordable menu options\u2014have remained a consumer favorite thanks to their low price points and value-focused menu options. I'm seeing many chains leverage technological advancements to improve service efficiency, such as reducing customer wait times. The segment has also been addressing consumer demand for enhanced convenience, sustainability and better dining experiences. As a result, the QSR industry is seeing 4.6% growth. Globally, it represented about $316 billion in 2024, and the International Foodservice Manufacturers Association (IFMA) predicts that it will reach $323.7 billion in 2025. Fitch Ratings also projects the QSR segment to outperform full-service restaurants this year. QSR chains have been adding new locations over the past few years and are planning more. For instance: \u2022 McDonald\u2019s plans 10,000 new openings annually through 2027 \u2022 KFC opens a new location every 3.5 hours on average \u2022 Subway announced future commitments for over 10,000 new restaurants \u2022 Domino's plans to open 300 to 350 new stores annually in 2025 and 2026 Eatertainment venues combine dining with engaging activities like bowling, art installation puzzles, murder mysteries and escape rooms. Some capitalize on the popularity of sports such as golf and pickleball. Many involve high-tech activities such as AI-driven ping pong or virtual reality experiences. Eatertainment venues are ripe for growth as consumers seek to get out of the house without the heavy expenditures that theme parks or concerts would entail. The segment benefits from heavy play on social media and consumer desire for activity-rich social experiences. Currently valued at more than $73 billion in 2021, the global eatertainment industry is projected to grow 6.7% annually through 2030. A third of the 9.1 million square feet of entertainment space slated to open in the U.S. and Canada from 2023 to 2025 will be devoted to pure eatertainment, according to JLL. Examples of eatertainment company expansions include: \u2022 33 international stores are in the works for Dave & Busters, with four to open in 2025 \u2022 11 Topgolf facilities are expected to open each year for the next five years \u2022 More than 15 projects are in the pipeline for Lucky Strike Amid inflation and economic uncertainty, discount and off-price retailers have become go-to destinations for budget-conscious consumers. These stores offer a mix of low-cost groceries, affordable luxury, apparel, budget-friendly household items and unexpected bargains on unique items. While enjoying a diverse customer base, budget-friendly retail has been especially popular with younger shoppers, which has helped expand the segment to more than $510 billion globally in 2022, according to Verified Market Research. Now, discount retail is projected to reach nearly $835 billion by 2030. The growth has led to an explosion of new stores over the past few years, with more anticipated this year. Recent and upcoming new store plans include: \u2022 1,300 more Dollar General and Dollar Tree stores this fiscal year \u2022 150 to 180 more Five Below locations in 2025 \u2022 50 new Ollie\u2019s Bargain Outlet stores in 2024 and possibly more to come in 2025 \u2022 89 new Ross Stores locations in fiscal 2024 with more to come Solid business is making these three segments formidable for leasing in 2025. And with record occupancy rates, the high demand of these segments will make vacating spaces worth more to property owners than when originally leased. Off-lease spaces can be snatched up before the current tenant even vacates as retailers look to fulfill strategies outlined to their shareholders. For investors, this heightened demand demonstrates how strip centers can be solid, income-generating assets. The continued expansion of quick-service restaurants, eatertainment venues and discount retailers is likely to drive higher occupancy rates, boost rental yields and increase property valuations\u2014making these retail categories essential contributors to the performance of retail investments in 2025.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"Business Insider Edition  With stocks down to start 2025, the consistent and relatively strong returns you can find in the fixed-income market may look attractive right about now. Cash equivalents like 3-month Treasury bills still offer yields above 4% as the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates elevated.          But the best place to be sitting at the moment is a bit further up in duration, according to Russ Brownback, the global head of macro positioning for fixed income and a co-portfolio manager of the $41 billion BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities Fund (BSIIX).               Brownback's fund currently yields 6.4% if held to maturity and is overweight short-to-medium-term securities. With a flat yield curve, this approach locks in income a bit longer than cash equivalents but saves investors from the volatility that the potential for rising inflation or a recession could bring to longer-duration assets, he said.               While the Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate Bond Index has a duration of about 6.5 years, Brownback's fund has about 3.5. \"We hold about 70% of our duration five years and shorter,\" he told BI.               But it's not just a matter of duration. To generate the 6.4% yield, Brownback tries to mix up the perfect cocktail of riskier assets with safer ones.               Around 28% of the fund is in commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, and non-agency mortgages, he said. By diversifying these riskier assets with higher-quality AAA securitized products, as well as with both higher- and lower-quality corporate credit, you get a robust return, Brownback said. AAA-rated credit is the highest class of investment-grade bonds, meaning the assets have the lowest risk levels.               \"That is the real sweet spot,\" Brownback said of the mix. \"As long as we're owning that in a diversified way, that's about the highest Sharpe Ratio that exists in markets today,\" he added, referencing the risk-to-reward ratio.               Despite the emphasis on diversification, Brownback said he's not worried about an impending economic downturn \u2014 a fear that has roiled markets lately as President Donald Trump implements sweeping tariff policies.               \"There's a lot of hyperbole around 'Oh my gosh, we're going to have a recession,' but that's been the narrative for the last two years, whether it was the regional banking crisis in '23 or last year thinking the central banks were staying too tight,\" he said. \"It feels like conventional wisdom has been looking for a hard landing around every corner for three years. We just don't see that.\"               Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell kept interest rates steady on at the central bank's March meeting, a signal that the economy may be stable enough not to need precautionary policy measures. But the decision to pause rate cuts was also a nod to the potential for inflation to flare up again amid tariffs, a reason Brownback is largely staying away from the long-end of the yield curve.               \"The Committee will assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,\" Powell said at a March 19 press conference. \"We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance, and we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"RTX 5060 Ti looks like it could go on sale April 16, with RTX 5060 to follow in May  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  We have a supposed release date for Nvidia\u2019s RTX 5060 Ti graphics cards, with the rumor mill offering up a date of April 16. This comes from leaker Wxnod, who chips in to the rumor scene on X from time to time, and has provided correct info in the past (although we must, of course, remain very cautious here). 5060Ti will be released on April 16th at 9pm, along with 8GB and 16GBMarch 22, 2025 As you can see in the above post, the assertion is that the RTX 5060 Ti will be \u2018released\u2019 on April 16th at 9pm (I\u2019ll come back to the wording here, and the lateness of the mentioned hour, shortly). And as the grapevine has insisted for a long time now, we\u2019re told that this GPU will come in both 8GB and 16GB flavors, and both of these versions will be out on that day in mid-April. This aligns with other recent chatter about the RTX 5060 Ti which claimed exactly this, that these GPUs are due in the middle of April. Those past rumors also theorize that its lesser sibling, the vanilla RTX 5060 (with just 8GB of VRAM), will arrive a month later in mid-May, though Wxnod doesn\u2019t mention that card.  If the rumor mill is right, Nvidia has delayed all of these RTX 5060 models a couple of times, perhaps \u2013 certainly there was speculation about a March launch in the past, and then talk of issues that needed to be fixed with the GPU chips. With more consistent chatter now pointing to a launch in the near future, though, it seems like this is now firmly in the cards. If you\u2019re wondering about the 9pm release mentioned by the leaker, this is likely due to the embargo timing being from an Asian source, because as VideoCardz points out, this aligns with what\u2019d typically be expected in that respect. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. When Wxnod says \u2018released\u2019 I would normally consider that phrasing to indicate an on-sale date \u2013 the graphics cards hitting the shelves \u2013 but this could also mean the initial launch (or reveal) of the RTX 5060 Ti models in this context. However, VideoCardz further flagged up that HKEPC, a Hong Kong-based tech site, also shared a leak (again, add seasoning) claiming that April 16 is in fact the on-sale date for the RTX 5060 Ti, with an announcement apparently due on April 15. (The RTX 5060 could also be revealed on April 15, but won\u2019t be in shops until May, or that\u2019s the theory). Whatever the case, these GPUs are apparently now close at hand, and what also backs this up is VideoCardz also discovering the purported final specs of the RTX 5060 Ti. The GPU will supposedly run with 4,608 CUDA Cores, a base clock of 2407MHz and boost to 2572MHz, with a power usage of 180W. The key question will be: how much stock can Nvidia muster? If the answer turns out to be not much, then Team Green might be wise to wait a bit longer and accumulate more supply before unleashing these graphics cards, which are likely to be much more popular than previous Blackwell GPUs due to their affordability. Or risk further wrath from disgruntled gamers who can't buy the GPU they want... On the other hand, Nvidia is likely feeling the heat from AMD now, with Team Red's new RDNA 4 GPUs doing very well and taking back graphics card market share by all accounts. Given that, Team Green may well feel the pressure to get its RTX 5060 Ti cards on the table, as it were, sooner rather than later. Currently, regarding the RX 9060's release, AMD has only given us a timeframe of Q2, so that could be as late as June.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"The ever-volatile stock market bounced Monday as investors once again tilted toward the notion President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs won\u2019t be quite as bad as first thought, with the latest rally led by the big technology stocks worst hit by the tariff-related market pullback, including Tesla, which had its best day on Wall Street in more than four months. Stocks gained Monday on a reported tariff reprieve. The S&P 500 rose 1.8% Monday, hitting its highest level since March 7. The U.S. equity benchmark is now up 4% from its six-month intraday low set March 13, though it remains 6% below its all-time high recorded in February. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied 1.4%, or more than 590 points, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 2.3%, as both indexes hit their highest levels in two weeks. The rally came thanks to \u201ceasing trade war angst\u201d on Wall Street, explained Sevens Report founder Tom Essaye, referencing Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal\u2019s weekend reports that Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs set to go into effect next week will be far more focused in nature than Trump previously suggested. Further fueling the comeback was Trump\u2019s afternoon comments suggesting he may give \u201ca lot of countries breaks\u201d from his looming reciprocal tariffs. The most notable gainers during the Monday jump were the \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d big American technology stocks. Shares of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla all gained, led by Tesla\u2019s near 11% surge. Monday is on track to be Tesla\u2019s best day since Nov. 6, the day after Trump won a second term, when investors flooded into the company run by Trump deputy Elon Musk. The septet has struggled badly to open 2025 due to the more acute impact of tariffs and the rotation into safer assets, and Tesla remains the S&P\u2019s second-biggest loser year-to-date even after the early week bounce. Even after gaining 2% on Monday, Bloomberg\u2019s magnificent seven index is down about 12% in 2025. $95 billion. That\u2019s about how much market capitalization Tesla added Monday, more than twice Ford\u2019s total valuation. Musk got about $16.5 billion richer during Monday\u2019s Tesla surge, pushing his net worth to a world-leading $351 billion, according to our latest estimates. Musk\u2019s fortune is still $110 billion below its December peak. In another signal of improving risk appetite, bitcoin prices rose to their highest level since March 7, trading above $88,000. That\u2019s a roughly 15% jump from the world\u2019s largest cryptocurrency\u2019s March low. Over the last two months, the stock market has been highly volatile, often swinging due to the latest developments regarding Trump\u2019s plans for his wide-sweeping tariffs. Trump said Friday the reciprocal tariffs he touts as his driving economic policy will have \"flexibility,\" as he signals that batch of tariffs will begin to roll out next Wednesday. Reciprocal tariffs seek to charge the same duty on imported goods as the same class of American goods face in the imports\u2019 countries of origin. Significant confusion about when the reciprocal tariffs will go into place and what effective rate different goods will face contributed to increased concerns the U.S. may dip into a recession, and the Federal Reserve warned last week it expects higher inflation and lower economic growth this year due to economic uncertainty.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"Target has announced it will reduce bonuses for salaried employees due to weak consumer spending and inflationary pressures.  Bloomberg, citing sources with knowledge of the situation, said employees will receive 87% of their eligible 2024 bonuses, a sharp decline from the previous year, when workers received 100% of their bonuses, with some even seeing their payouts double.  The bonus cut follows Target\u2019s (TGT) March earnings report, in which it issued a cautious outlook, citing \u201congoing consumer uncertainty\u201d and concerns over tariff impacts. A Target spokesman told Quartz that bonus outcomes were based only on Target\u2019s financial performance for the total fiscal year 2024. CEO Brian Cornell warned that fresh produce imports from Mexico \u2013 specifically bananas, avocados, and strawberries \u2013 would be directly affected by these tariffs, leading to price hikes. Executives also said they would move from quarterly guidance to an annual forecast to better manage volatility. Further complicating matters, Target has pulled back Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, a move that has led to a significant drop in foot traffic. While retailers like Walmart (WMT) and McDonald\u2019s have scaled back similar programs, Target\u2019s decision has prompted a 40-day boycott. Adding to the company\u2019s struggles is a lawsuit from shareholders, who allege Target concealed the risks tied to its DEI efforts. The state of Florida has filed a similar lawsuit.  Once a favorite for its \u201cTarzhay\u201d shopping experience, Target has struggled to capture the attention of bargain-hunting consumers for quite some time. In Nov. 2024, the company reported its largest earnings miss in years, prompting its stock to fall over 20%. Despite these challenges, Target has aggressively slashed prices on thousands of non-essential items like apparel and home goods in hopes of drawing customers back. Even a partnership with Taylor Swift, in which the retailer sold \u201cThe Eras Tour Book,\u201d saw significant in-store traffic during the holiday season.  To turn things around, Target plans to invest between $4 billion and $5 billion this year to upgrade existing and stores and open at least 20 new locations, with three already opened in Arizona, California, and Texas. The company aims to add around 300 U.S. locations over the next decade. As part of its push to regain market share, Target is expanding its private-label food line, Good & Gather, with 600 new food and beverage items.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"We used to see a lot of pure form exploration in ID student work. These days school projects are growing more research- and digital-based, with less of an emphasis on form. So when it comes to seeing strange, experimental new shapes, it is the EDC microeconomy that's leading the charge. A case in point is this bizarre Tactitool, by an independent fabricator called Full Carbon Alchemist. It's essentially a knurled aluminum sleeve that chunkifies a AAA flashlight, and adds three weaponizing protrusions that I can only call carbon fiber knuckles.      To some extent, form does follow function here. The carbon fiber protrusions are umbrella-shaped, providing hooks on either side for, get this, carrying grocery bag handles.   There's also a pair of glassbreakers on the bottom, as being trapped inside something seems to be a common EDC market worry.   For all of the fabrication that went into this object, I'm surprised to see it retails for $42.   It's creative for sure, though rounded carbon-fiber 'knuckles' don't seem like they'd do a lot of damage (they should be plenty strong enough to carry a bag of groceries, at least).

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"The Phone 3a offers great cameras and design but the Moto G Power is fully waterproof and easier to buy in the U.S..  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.    A worthy successor The Nothing Phone 3a is a marked improvement over the 2a in many areas for a slight bump in price. It has the iconic transparent design, a telephoto camera, faster charging, and a vivid display. The new Essential Space has some neat AI features that are actually useful.   A solid product The Moto G Power 2025 gets a couple of things right like the design, build quality, battery life, and excellent IP69 waterproofing. It also has good support for all major U.S. carriers and is easily available. The cameras are still not that great though and the display is not an OLED like the Phone 3a. The year 2025 is off to a fantastic start as far as budget and mid-range smartphones go. We've already got a pretty eclectic range of options to choose from, our current favorite being the Nothing Phone 3a. As a successor to the highly popular Phone 2a, the 3a offers a useful third telephoto camera, slightly quicker charging, and a brighter OLED display. It's not easily available everywhere, like in the U.S., which is where the Moto G Power 2025 comes in. Motorola's offering is cheaper than the Phone 3a, more readily available in the U.S., and has stronger waterproofing. It's also a solid and dependable phone with equally lean software, a decently long update commitment for its price, and you get wireless charging. Deciding between the Nothing Phone 3a vs. Moto G Power 2025 can get tricky, but that's where we come in.  Why you can trust Android Central     Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.   The Nothing Phone 3a follows the company's signature look of a transparent glass back panel with neatly laid out components. The side frame is plastic but it's matte so there's good enough grip when you hold it and it doesn't look cheap. We have the programmable Glyph lights too around the camera module which are a fun addition. The phone is slim but a bit weighty at 201 grams. Nothing has given it an IP64 rating for dust and splash resistance. While this is better than the 2a, it's not great for a mid-range phone in 2025. The 3a comes in white, black, and blue, but the latter is limited to select markets. The Nothing Phone 3a's display is nicely specced with a large 6.77-inch AMOLED display and 120Hz refresh rate. It's a Full-HD resolution only but the pixel count is well above 300 ppi, so images and text look sharp. Nothing has chosen Panda Glass for scratch protection, which held up well when we tested it. Brightness levels are also pretty great with up to 1,300 nits when using it outdoors and up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness.  The Moto G Power 2025 has slightly taller dimensions but similar thickness and weight as the Phone 3a. The design is now similar to Motorola's more premium phones, which gives the G Power better street cred. We also liked the tough build quality of the phone which earns it a MIL-STD-810H rating. The back panel is made of faux-leather instead of glass but it still looks and feels quite premium. The lack of glass also means there's no worry of any shattering if you drop it. The G Power 2025 comes in a striking Leaf Green colorway and also Slate Gray. The Moto G Power 2025 doesn't have a very captivating display as the Nothing Phone 3a, but it gets the job done. It's a 6.8-inch IPS panel with a similar resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and Gorilla Glass 5 scratch protection. The display worked fine in all lighting conditions during our review period, and we didn't face any issues. The one design feature that really makes this phone stand out if the IP68\/ IP69 rating. IP69 is something that's not available even on most flagship phones, so to see this on a $300 phone is pretty cool.  The Nothing Phone 3a is only available in the U.S. via the beta program, which means you need to jump through a few hoops in order to get it. As of writing this, Nothing's website says the 3a is sold out and new stocks are only expected in two months. Only the top-end variant with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is listed for $379. Nothing does sell a base variant too with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage in other markets for less. Apart from availability, there are compatibility issues right now with AT&T and Verizon's networks, but T-Mobile works just fine. The Nothing Phone 3a uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 processor, which is a budget SoC optimized to improve AI performance. Sadly, gaming performance is actually worse than its predecessor, which is a step down. We noticed lower FPS in games like Minecraft on the Phone 3a vs. the 2a. Thankfully, battery life is very good for a phone of its class. The 5,000mAh capacity will easily carry you through more than a day before you'll need to charge it. The 50W wired charging also ensures the battery is charged quickly, although you'll need to buy the charger separately. Wireless charging is a bit of a miss, something that the Moto offers.  The Moto G Power 2025 delivers equally good battery life with the same capacity as the 3a. Charging speed is slower at 30W and you'll need to buy the adapter separately. There is 15W wireless charging, which is pretty good for a phone of its class. The G Power 2025 only comes in a single variant with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage for $299. This makes it more affordable than the Phone 3a. Being a Motorola, you'll also easily find it online or at offline stores in the U.S. and it's compatible with all the major carriers. What's not so great though is the performance. Somehow, Motorola picked a worse SoC than the 2024 model for the new G Power and that shows even in everyday use. Even with 8GB of RAM and a clean UI, we noticed intermittent lag and sluggishness when using it. It's certainly not the best phone gaming and performs worse than the Phone 3a. Category Nothing Phone 3a Moto G Power 2025 Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 Mediatek Dimensity 6300\u00a0 Display 6.77-inch 120Hz LTPO OLED, 2392 x 1080, HDR10, 1300 nits HBM, 3000 nits max, 2160Hz PWM dimming 6.8-inch 120Hz IPS LCD, 2388 x 1080, Gorilla Glass 5 Operating System Nothing OS 3.1 (Android 15) Hello UX (Android 15) Memory 8GB\/12GB 8GB Storage 128GB\/256GB 128GB Rear cameras 50MP f\/1.88 Samsung, 1\/1.57\" sensor, 4K30, OIS, PDAF; 50MP f\/2.0 Samsung, 1\/2.74\" sensor, 2x optical zoom, EIS, Autofocus; 8MP f\/2.2 Sony, 120-degree FoV 50MP f\/1.8, OIS, PDAF; 8MP f\/2.2 ultrawide Front camera 32MP f\/2.2 Samsung, 1\/3.44\" sensor 16MP f\/2.4 Battery 5,000mAh 5,000mAh  Charging 50W wired charging 30W wired charging, 15W wireless charging Connectivity Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.4, global 5G bands, NFC, GPS, dual nano-SIM 5G bands, Wi-Fi ac, Bluetooth, NFC Dimensions 163.52 x 77.5 x 8.35 mm 166.6 x 77.1 x 8.7 mm Weight 201g 208g Durability IP64 IP68\/IP69 With the Nothing Phone 3a, you get three OS upgrades and six years of security patches. The phone ships with Nothing OS 3.1, which is based on Android 15 and includes all the latest AI features like Essential Space. This feature is still in beta but the dedicated button makes it very easy to fire up some of the apps like voice memo or note-taking, when needed. More smart features like Smart Search, Smart Collections, and Focus Search are expected to come in a future update. The interface is clean and bloat-free, which is something we really like about Nothing's software approach. The Moto G Power 2025 has a similar near-stock Android-like experience. You get Android 15 out of the box but only two major OS upgrades after that. Motorola hasn't had the best track record of issuing timely updates either so we'll take this promise with a bit of salt for now. As we mentioned above, the interface does get sluggish at times even if you're not doing anything taxing. There aren't many AI features either as that isn't really the focus of this phone.  Nothing debuts a telephoto camera on its phones for the first time in the Phone 3a (and 3a Pro). The 3a boasts an impressive 50MP telephoto with 2x optical zoom and 30x digital zoom. There's also a 50MP main camera and an 8MP ultrawide. In our testing, we came away impressed with the image quality from all the cameras, which is a big improvement over the Phone 2a. The phone can also do 4K 30fps videos, which is pretty respectable. The cameras on the Moto G Power 2025 are serviceable under good lighting, but that's about it. You only get a 50MP wide and an 8MP ultra-wide sensor on the back, both of which deliver okay image quality. The same goes for the 16MP selfie camera, which is no match for the 32MP sensor in the Phone 3a.  If you live in a region outside the U.S. where the Nothing Phone 3a is easily available, you should 100% buy it over the Moto G Power 2025. It might cost a bit more, but you'll be getting a vastly better-looking phone as well as excellent cameras, good performance, slick software with a longer update cycle, and quicker charging. Apart from the weaker waterproofing and no wireless charging, there's no major con going against it. The Nothing Phone 3a Pro is also worth considering if you need better telephoto and selfie cameras. For those living in the U.S., the Moto G Power 2025 is still a good buy at $300. If your priority is battery life and a phone that can survive a dishwasher, there's nothing better in this segment. You should be able to find the Pixel 7a for around $329 online as an alternative to the Moto. The Pixel gets you much better cameras, an OLED screen, an IP67 rating, and software updates till early 2028.   The best phone under $400 The Nothing Phone 3a is hard to beat and is something you can blindly buy if it's available in your region. You stand to get a great design, useful AI features, good cameras, and solid battery life.   Best waterproof phone of its class If you need the best waterproofing in a $300 phone, look no further than the Moto G Power 2025. It also delivers good battery life and build quality, making it a great value pick.

HP will continue to scale up efforts to make and distribute more PCs here in the US as well as in other countries as it transforms its production and distribution from a global model to a more localized model, said HP\u2019s president and CEO Enrique Lores. Lores made that admission in his opening address at the HP Amplify Conference in Nashville this week, highlighting the important changes taking place in the company around its supply chain. But what does all that mean for average consumers, like you and me and Joe Shmoe down the street who wants to buy the latest Omen gaming PC? Are we poised to win from such an arrangement? Or lose out badly from geopolitical pressures and rising tariffs? When the HP executive team weighed in, the answer was twofold. Firstly, the changes will bring more predictability in HP\u2019s stock movement in that \u201cthere will be more of the right kind of stock where we want it, when we want it,\u201d said Ernest Nicolas, chief enterprise operations officer at HP. He backed this claim up with data to show how the company had bettered its own supply chain predictability score from just 50 percent in 2023 up to 93 percent this year. Dominic Bayley \/ IDG The second improvement Nicolas highlighted was the speed with which HP can build, move, and deliver customer orders. This is likely to mean you\u2019ll be able to get your products a lot sooner than was possible previously. Again, Nicolas presented data to prove it and said: \u201cIn previous years we weren\u2019t so focused on the customer experience. We\u2019ve designed our supply chain to be much more customer centric. We built applications to track and monitor the customer orders. So, all the way through our shipments we can drill down by market, location, we can look at a certain SKU, all the things we couldn\u2019t do before.\u201d As well as readying its internal processes, HP has made big strides to set up the infrastructure it needs to operate its new supply chain. In the last two years, it has expanded its US operations and also opened operations in what it considers to be the key growing markets of Mexico, Thailand, and Indonesia. A new facility in Saudi Arabia was also just announced. As to fears over tariffs, Lores had this to say: \u201cWe don\u2019t know how tariffs are going to change and what the different implications will be for different countries. But we have a much more flexible supply chain than in previous years and it\u2019s that flexibility that we will use to minimize the impact of tariffs. He said further, \u201cWe\u2019ll also be looking at opportunities to reduce costs and eventually we\u2019ll be looking at price, so those are the three things we\u2019ll be looking at (and in that order).\u201d Disclosure: PCWorld accepted travel and accommodation to the HP Amplify Conference in order to view and try out HP products that were being released and not physically available in the author\u2019s location.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"A sign of change in the PSU market or just a one-off for a specific market?  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Nvidia's 12VHPWR power connector, later updated to the 12V-2x6 format, has been at the centre of controversy since it first appeared on certain GeForce RTX 30-series cards four years ago. Now there's a new chapter in its history, as MSI has become the first PSU manufacturer to all but abandon the evergreen 8-pin power connector in its latest top-end power supply units. Over the years, the power demands of a gaming PC have steadily increased and power supply units have followed suit by offering additional sockets for all the extra cables needed. Take any modern PSU and you'll see multiple sockets for powering the CPU, motherboard, drives, and of course, the graphics card. In the case of the latter, one typically gets two or three 8-pin sockets. Take the Corsair RM750X, as an example. It has two connectors for driving a graphics card, next to those for the CPU. Nothing unusual about that whatsoever and it's pretty much the norm. However, as reported by Overclock3D, MSI's new MPG A1000GS and MPG A1250GS PSUs only sport one 8-pin socket. You may well ask why would MSI do this. Let me be clear right now: this isn't a move against AMD, which has many graphics cards that require two 8-pin power cables, but it's instead more of a move towards\u2026 yes, you've guessed it\u2026 AI. The reason why those two new PSUs only have one 8-pin connector is because they both sport two 12V-2x6 sockets instead. The company does offer PSUs with up to three 8-pin and one 16-pin power slots. The only reason why anyone would want to use two 12V-2x6 cables is to have a PC with two Nvidia graphics cards but given that SLI is dead and long gone on the latest generation of GeForce GPUs, dual setups are purely for AI, to let you do your own training and inference. One could argue that all of this is a nothing burger, as the PSU market is chock-full of different manufacturers and models, and there is no shortage of PSUs with two or three 8-pin connectors. However, it does make me wonder just how much longer the ol' 8-pinner will stick around. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. While the 12VHPWR\/12V-2x6 has questionable margins of safety when operating at its maximum rated current load, the dinky connector is absolutely fine when dealing with power demands of, say, 300 W or so. I personally find the design to be much easier to use than the traditional 8-pin but that's purely because I'm constantly swapping graphics cards around on a near-daily basis, so I'm hardly representative of the whole PC gaming market.  Best CPU cooler: keep your chip chilled in styleBest PC fans: super-silent and plastered in RGBBest PC cases: big, little, and everything in-between. However, from a system manufacturer's perspective, using a single 16-pin cable is more agreeable than having two use up to three 8-pin ones. I know we're talking mere cents and minutes here, in terms of cost and fitting time, but when you're churning out thousands of PCs on a regular basis, it all adds up. And that's why I wonder how long it'll be before OEM\/SI companies put enough pressure on AMD and Intel (and Nvidia for its mainstream cards) to switch to the PCI group-ratified power connector for every graphics card. We hardly ever see Molex connectors used in a new PC build these days so it's not like older designs always stick around. Fortunately, the PSU market is so competitive, that I suspect that we'll still be able to purchase three 8-pin socket units for at least another ten years. But it looks like MSI is happy to start the transition now, at least for a few, niche power supplies.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":" Japanese minimalist brand Muji has answered the prayers of design enthusiasts worldwide with the revival of its coveted aluminum hard carry case. First launched in 2017 to critical acclaim, this masterpiece of functional design is making a triumphant return to the market with a striking addition \u2013 an elegant matte black finish that has already captured the attention of travelers and collectors alike. The reintroduction comes directly in response to persistent customer demand for the original aluminum suitcase designed by renowned product designer Naoto Fukasawa. Known for his \u201cwithout thought\u201d design philosophy that emphasizes intuitive functionality, Fukasawa\u2019s influence is evident in every aspect of this suitcase. The clean lines, thoughtful proportions, and meticulous attention to detail reflect the designer\u2019s commitment to creating objects that seamlessly integrate into our lives while elevating everyday experiences through subtle refinement. Designer: Muji       Available in two practical sizes \u2013 a compact 34-liter option perfect for weekend getaways and a spacious 60-liter version ideal for longer journeys \u2013 these suitcases offer versatility without compromising on style. The dual-wheel caster system ensures remarkably smooth movement across various surfaces, while the integrated braking mechanism provides stability when needed. This thoughtful engineering demonstrates Muji\u2019s understanding that true luxury lies not just in aesthetics but in how an object performs during real-world use.        What truly distinguishes this aluminum luggage is its embrace of wabi-sabi principles \u2013 the Japanese concept that finds beauty in imperfection and transience. Unlike typical hard-shell suitcases that look worn and damaged after acquiring scratches, each dent and mark becomes part of the suitcase\u2019s evolving character. It tells the story of your travels and creates a deeply personal object that grows more distinctive with each journey.  The monochromatic color scheme extends beyond mere aesthetics to create a cohesive visual experience. Both the body and telescopic handle share identical coloration, reinforcing the minimalist impression that has become Muji\u2019s signature. This consistency in design language speaks to the brand\u2019s unwavering commitment to simplicity and harmony, principles that have earned Muji its devoted following among design-conscious consumers who appreciate understated elegance over ostentatious branding.   Inside the suitcase, practicality reigns supreme with a three-stage telescopic handle that adjusts to various heights, accommodating travelers of different statures. Security concerns are addressed through the integration of TSA-approved locks, allowing for peace of mind without sacrificing convenience during international travel. These thoughtful interior features demonstrate that Muji\u2019s commitment to functionality extends throughout the entire product.  Currently, the coveted black edition is exclusive to the Japanese market, reflecting Muji\u2019s strategy of regional product differentiation. Priced between \u00a579,000 and \u00a599,000 (approximately $533-$668 USD), these suitcases represent a significant investment. However, devotees of exceptional design recognize the value proposition \u2013 a timeless object that combines durability, functionality, and aesthetic appeal in equal measure.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":" It wasn\u2019t until recently that tablets shed off their \u201cmedia consumption device\u201d identity and stepped into productivity and content creation. The larger screen of the iPad Pro and its accompanying Apple Pencil proved that you can do a lot more on such a device. Over the years, however, this market has somewhat stagnated again, but the rise of E Ink tablets like Bigme, BOOX, Supernote, and reMarkable are once again shaking up the industry. The only problem with the latter group of devices is that, even if they displayed colors, their displays were more muted and pixelated, better suited for reading text and nothing else. There are now a few tablets that are trying to offer the best of both worlds, delivering true colors and fast screen refresh rates for regular digital content while being friendlier on the eyes. One of those comes from a rather unlikely source, a brand that\u2019s better known for color-accurate pen displays and drawing tablets for artists and designers. Designer: XPPen        To be clear, the XPPen Magic Note Pad doesn\u2019t use a Color E Ink screen or even a transflective LCD screen. It has a rather standard 1920\u00d71200 display with a 90Hz refresh rate, 95% sRGB gamut, and support for 16.7 million colors. Its special sauce, however, is the three modes you can set for the display, depending on your activity or preference.        Nature Color Mode gives you access to the whole spectrum of hues that the screen can support and is best for content consumption, making digital art, designing, and other creative works. Light Color Mode dials the saturation down to reduce eye fatigue, making it more suited for taking notes, reading comics or books with illustrations, or even browsing the web. Finally, there\u2019s Ink Paper Mode that removes all color for a more relaxing paper-like reading experience.   Beyond this, the XPPen Magic Note Pad is like a general-purpose version of its Magic Drawing Pad, both of which are Android tablets. In terms of specs, the Magic Note Pad leans more towards the mid-range tablet market, so don\u2019t expect impressive gaming capabilities from this slate. That said, probably the only reason you\u2019d even be taking a glance at this device is the integration of XPPen\u2019s stylus technology, one of Wacom\u2019s bigger rivals in this space.  The XPPen Magic Note Pad probably won\u2019t satisfy more discerning e-book readers, as the black-and-white mode doesn\u2019t exactly reduce eye fatigue as much as a true E Ink tablet would. But for someone who constantly switches between sketching, note-taking, and reading, the device is more versatile than any e-book reader, and also a little more affordable than the likes of the Galaxy Tab S with a price tag of $395.99 only.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"The console\u2019s key games tell the story of a changing Nintendo by  Oli Welsh and  Michael McWhertor What games do you think of when you think of Nintendo\u2019s Switch? There are several obvious answers; Nintendo\u2019s in-house studios never fail to leave their mark on a system with a handful of brilliant games. Yet one of the most notable things about the Switch, as it prepares to cede the limelight to Switch 2 after eight years on the market, is that it has been less software-dependent than, perhaps, any Nintendo console since the NES. Of course the Switch wouldn\u2019t be the success it has been without its biggest games. In its first year, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe helped the console find a massive audience. Yet both started as games for Wii U, Nintendo\u2019s least successful platform. The Switch really was a case of a console that carved out a space for itself by arriving with the right form factor at the right time. The games that worked well on it found a console that was uniquely capable of adapting itself to suit them and helping them find players, rather than the other way around. The Switch began a new era for Nintendo as a platform holder that began to look a little more like the others, even if it continued to play by its own rules. The games that defined the console aren\u2019t necessarily the best or the biggest. Shockingly, they don\u2019t include a mainline Mario platform game. They\u2019re the games that described what the Switch meant to players, and how it changed Nintendo \u2014 and the rest of the game industry.  Animal Crossing: New Horizons\u2019 unprecedented success on Switch was a mixed blessing. It was in no small part a blockbuster hit due to the devastating worldwide pandemic that forced us indoors and into isolation around its release. New Horizons gave many of its players a taste of connection and community when they couldn\u2019t physically meet up with friends, family, and colleagues. But New Horizons was more than just a digital alternative to real-world socializing. It was a place where we made new virtual friends, found comfort in routine, and exercised control over our lives, albeit imaginary ones lived on our own private islands. The coziness of Animal Crossing was a refuge during a difficult stretch. That\u2019s not to say that New Horizons wasn\u2019t an enjoyable evolution of the Animal Crossing experience on its own merits. It was. There was joy to be found in building and customizing a home \u2014 and even in paying it off \u2014 and exploiting the game\u2019s quirks to amass riches. Millions of us delighted in daily interactions with Isabelle, Blathers, and the Nook boys, and waited with anticipation as new villagers visited our town, praying that we\u2019d pull a \u201cdreamy.\u201d It was a brief taste of video game monoculture, fueled by the state of the world, and a defining moment in the Switch\u2019s success. \u2014Michael McWhertor Breath of the Wild has become so inextricably linked with the Switch that it\u2019s easy to forget it was also released on Wii U, and in fact was announced as a Wii U game before we even knew what the Switch was. Nintendo\u2019s decision to pivot it to a cross-gen release gifted the Switch what might be the greatest launch title of all time. Beyond that, it marked a creative turning point for Nintendo as a game developer, and sent a clear message that the Switch was ushering in a new era for the company. The game\u2019s bold, nonlinear, systemic design was a huge departure for the Zelda series, synthesizing many influences from beyond Nintendo\u2019s Miyamoto-worshipping bubble into something that was distinctive and original, but also felt like it had been made in a world where Skyrim and Minecraft had happened. The sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, took things even further by giving players an astonishing, almost game-breaking level of creative freedom. Breath of the Wild turned one of Nintendo\u2019s oldest franchises into its most modern. It also outsold every mainline Mario game on the Switch, a first for the Zelda series. It was quite clear that Nintendo would never be the same again. \u2014Oli Welsh Switch was a platform for second chances. Many of Nintendo\u2019s games that failed to break through on the poorly selling Wii U found new life on Switch, including the Splatoon franchise, Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, and Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker. But none of those ports and rereleases have enjoyed the incredible success of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, a souped-up version of the 2014 kart racer that has since gone on to outsell its predecessor eight times over. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the Switch game; two out of every five Switch owners have a copy. It was so successful for Nintendo that, five years after Deluxe launched, the company released 48 more courses and eight additional characters as DLC. In an equally important move, Nintendo included that DLC as part of its Nintendo Switch Online subscription, part of the company\u2019s plan to offer more than just multiplayer connectivity and classic games. It\u2019s telling that the first game Nintendo has shown for Switch 2 is a new Mario Kart. Deluxe not only brought in all-new fans of the Mario Kart franchise, it helped get the storied franchise back on, ahem, track. \u2014MM Let\u2019s be honest; the Switch is not the ideal platform to play The Witcher 3. Nintendo\u2019s console is manifestly underpowered for a game that was cutting-edge in 2015 and remained a technical showpiece when Nintendo\u2019s console launched two years later. At the time, Nintendo was also not a natural home for such bloody, sexy, world-weary fare. This is precisely why the Switch port of The Witcher 3 is so important. It\u2019s significant that anyone tried to make it, and incredible that they pulled it off. Nintendo had long left the world of AAA gaming behind, and even during the success of the Wii, big publishers tended not to bring their marquee titles over because they were too technically demanding or aimed at a perceived different market. When the Wii U flopped, many third parties deserted Nintendo altogether. The Switch, however, was not just a huge sales success \u2014 with its appealing form factor and the undeniable Breath of the Wild, it had thrust Nintendo back into the hearts of the core gaming community. All of a sudden, third parties were clamoring to be part of it, and a few studios began to specialize in cramming AAA titles onto Switch\u2019s aging mobile chipset and into the tight confines of its game cards. A wave of \u201cmiracle\u201d ports began with 2016\u2019s Doom, and of these, the 2019 port of The Witcher 3 was the white whale. Not long after, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X widened the technical gulf again to a point where the ports would start to dry up \u2014 but you can expect the floodgates to reopen on Switch 2. \u2014OW \u201cEveryone is here!\u201d Nintendo promised with Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. The game maker not only kept that promise, it overdelivered with one of the most impressive expansions to any Nintendo franchise ever. In addition to stacking the game\u2019s core roster with 69 playable characters, including every fighter who\u2019d ever appeared in a Smash Bros. game and surprising newcomers like Castlevania\u2019s Simon and Metroid\u2019s Ridley, the game\u2019s developers pulled off what felt like impossible licensing deals. Banjo and Kazooie. Kingdom Hearts\u2019 Sora. Final Fantasy 7\u2019s Sephiroth. Minecraft\u2019s Steve and Alex.  The massive growth of the Switch and the fervor for more Super Smash Bros. seemed to feed off of each other. Led by tireless game maker Masahiro Sakurai, the yearslong development of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate resulted in the series\u2019 biggest entry yet, so gargantuan that one has to question if Nintendo and Sakurai can ever top it. And while Super Smash Bros. Ultimate was a major step forward for the franchise, Nintendo\u2019s approach to esports and its games being featured at non-Nintendo-sanctioned events hasn\u2019t evolved much during the Switch era. \u2014MM Who would have seen Labo coming? Nintendo\u2019s DIY \u201cbuild-and-play\u201d line of accessories let Switch owners craft cardboard \u201cToy-Con\u201d versions of real-world items like a 13-key piano, fishing rod, and motorbike \u2014 and even a VR headset \u2014 for an all-new play experience that evoked the wild accessories released during the Wii era.  In retrospect, it\u2019s almost shocking that Nintendo Labo arrived just 13 months after the release of the Switch. What now feels like a late-life cycle attempt to reinvigorate the Switch with a gimmick was just another moment of unexpected innovation from Nintendo. While interest in Labo died out fairly quickly (building the Toy-Cons was 90% of the fun), it was a reminder of the uniqueness and adaptability of the Switch Joy-Cons to act as more than just conveniently detachable controllers \u2014 an idea that Nintendo would later explore with the similarly creative and unexpected Ring Fit Adventure. \u2014MM It might seem strange to choose Scarlet and Violet to represent Pok\u00e9mon on this list. Of the Switch\u2019s mainline Pok\u00e9mon titles, Sword and Shield were better received by fans and even sold better (by a hair\u2019s breadth). But it\u2019s precisely because of their performance woes and uninspired design that Scarlet and Violet are, sadly, more symptomatic of the Switch era. The runaway success of the Switch always represented a risk that Nintendo might rush too keenly to capitalize, letting its famous quality control standards slip in the process. As far as its internal studios were concerned, iron discipline was maintained, but Nintendo didn\u2019t have as much success in keeping its partners at The Pok\u00e9mon Company and developer Game Freak in check. The Switch saw 12 Pok\u00e9mon games released in six years, including four (soon to be five) major Game Freak titles; the developer released Scarlet and Violet and the superior Pok\u00e9mon Legends: Arceus in the same year. It was just too much, and Scarlet and Violet bore the signs of an exhausted studio trapped in a content grind. You really can have too much of a good thing. \u2014OW Pairing the greatest video game of all time with the hot genre of the moment for Tetris 99 felt both like a uniquely classic Nintendo move and surprisingly forward-thinking for the company. While other game makers chased variations on the battle royale shooter, Nintendo and developer Arika took a different approach, resulting in a frenetically fun, all-ages take on what is traditionally a violent genre. Shadow-dropped as a bonus perk for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers in 2019, the release of Tetris 99 brought fresh buzz to the Switch. Its success spawned even more variations on the battle royale formula from Nintendo, with Super Mario Bros. 35 and F-Zero 99. (Arika also created a 99-player battle royale version of Pac-Man for Bandai Namco.) Tetris 99\u2019s most lasting impact, however, may be its role as a value add for NSO subscribers. Nintendo, having already mined most of its back catalog from the NES and SNES era for Nintendo Switch Online\u2019s classic games offerings, will need more games like Tetris 99 to keep Switch 2 owners interested and subscribed to the service. \u2014MM The Switch era has run parallel with a surge in interest in Japanese-made RPGs, and it\u2019s very much not a coincidence. Japanese publishers and developers naturally flooded to the console, which had huge sales in their home market, at the same time as the overseas anime boom created just the right cultural environment for these games to have an international moment. Nintendo saw the opportunity and lent a hand, often shining a light on Japanese-made games in its Direct broadcasts, and occasionally stepping in to co-publish games like Square Enix\u2019s gorgeous throwback Octopath Traveler. Nintendo was well placed to benefit from this snowball effect with some of its own games, including the Xenoblade Chronicles series. But the ultimate example was 2019\u2019s Fire Emblem: Three Houses. Intelligent Systems\u2019 tactical RPG series had always been beloved within its specific niche, but the audience the Switch had amassed for anime-flavored RPGs turned it into something bigger \u2014 a sort of viral hit, powered by players\u2019 obsession over the game\u2019s characters and relationships and its Harry Potter-style system of rival school houses. Three Houses showed how the Switch was, and remains, one of the most fandom-friendly platforms around. \u2014OW While major third parties took a little longer to turn their oil tankers in Nintendo\u2019s direction, the indie developer scene saw the potential of Nintendo\u2019s machine almost instantly and rushed to take advantage. For several years, it was common for indies to release their hits on Steam and Switch first, and worry about PlayStation and Xbox later. The Switch\u2019s humble tech was no barrier to these games, and the immediacy of their designs often suited portable play perfectly. The two games that most symbolize the Switch\u2019s indie era are 2018\u2019s Hollow Knight and 2020\u2019s Hades \u2014 both fantastically refined action games in popular genres that are tricky to get right (Metroidvania and roguelike, respectively). Both found huge audiences, thanks in part to the Switch\u2019s enormous reach. Of the two, it\u2019s probably Team Cherry\u2019s Hollow Knight that is more closely associated with the Switch \u2014 if only because its long, long-awaited sequel Silksong was first announced at a Nintendo Direct, and the increasingly desperate anticipation of new info about the game ahead of every Direct since has become a meme. \u2014OW  The best way to stay up to date on all things Nintendo Switch 2. \u00a9 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.   Off the Record is a column written by Android Central's editor-in-chief. The column looks to expand and go in-depth on topics in the Android space without any limitations. Google\u2019s lineup of phones is becoming bloated, and I think the company should have merged the Pixel 9 and 9a into one phone and changed specs and pricing options. The 9a launched on March 19, coming with a new design and ditching the usual pill-shaped aluminum camera bar for a flat rear panel. Priced at $499, the phone comes with AI features, including Gemini Live, Add Me, Magic Editor, the Tensor G4 chip, and seven years of OS and security updates. So, with all of these great features at a fantastic price, why should anyone bother buying the Pixel 9 (starting at $799) when it seems the 9a has similar, if not better, features and is $300 cheaper? Like my colleague, Andrew Myrick, wrote last year, it\u2019s time for Google to rethink its lineup of devices and streamline its offerings. And it turns out I'm not the only one who thinks Google needs to revamp its Pixel lineup. So does Android Authority in their recent article. That said, I don't know if I agree that Google should take the iPhone route with its lineup.  I asked Google if there were really enough consumers to justify releasing a Pixel 9 and a 9a, and I was told there was. \u201cWhen we look at our devices, the goal is really to deliver the core Pixel experience and deliver on that incredible camera, the incredible Google AI, and then access to the latest version of Android. [Pixel] 9 is leveling off of those experiences. So there\u2019s a significant boost in image quality, based on the sensors we use in 9, and the capabilities of that camera are quite better than what we have in the A series.\u201d \u201cSimilarly, from a charging perspective, we find that the 9 serves a user that may be looking for that faster charging experience. And then finally, the display on our 9 devices tends to be of a higher quality than what\u2019s on our A series,\u201d said Shenaz Zack Mistry, senior director of product management for Pixel. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Google says that there is a user that might want a little more and that from their \u201cportfolio perspective\u2026we have just as many users on that premium tier as we do in our entry tier. So we do believe there\u2019s users in both of those categories.\u201d  The Pixel 9 launched in September 2024, giving consumers at least six months with a phone that has very similar features to the new 9a. Per this Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 9 comparison chart, you can see that there are several features that the 9a has that are similar to or even better than the 9, but the phone launches much later than the 9. This means consumers will have to wait for a cheaper phone with Pro-like features and specs.

So, I think Google should have merged the 9 and 9a and offered a much better phone at a reasonable price point somewhere between the two, which would allow Google to still get a great ROI. The Pixel 9 is able to perform well because of the higher RAM, and as a result, Gemini features work seamlessly and on-device, a lacking feature in the 9a. I think the blended phone should have a higher RAM to offer the features the 9a isn\u2019t able to do so, but at the same time, it should still offer the other compromises that keep the phone from performing at a Pro level and, therefore, keeping the price down. I personally do not think that many people care about wireless charging, so maintaining wireless charging at the 9a level, in my opinion, is fine and, as a result, does not require more expensive components to increase the cost of the overall phone. The blended phone would have the 9a battery size and the same camera features as the 9, but if Google wanted to save on some cost, then using cheaper sensors might be smart, for example. Since the processor is the same for both phones, you know the blended phone will still be of top quality. The most important thing here is the price of the phone. This merged phone would cost around $600 or $650; the perfect in-between while still keeping it fairly affordable. In fact, if Google needs an example of how to make an affordable flagship-like phone, it only needs to look at the OnePlus 13R, which offers incredible value and specs for the price.  I know that my reality of what I want from Google may not happen. However, I do think that Google needs to figure out its strategy between the two phones. Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, agrees. He said in 2024, Pixel shipments grew 5.9%, and in the year prior grew 55.4%. I\u2019m going to guess the increase in sales in 2023 was because of the launch of the Pixel 8 series, which included Google\u2019s suite of AI features for the first time in a lineup of phones. Urbani notes that the share of the Pixel A series has generally been shrinking for the past few years and accounted for 32.1% (almost a third) in 2024. Meanwhile, the share of base Pixel has only trended down slightly while the Pro and Fold versions have gained a share, he said. That said, Ubrani notes that while the A series market share is shrinking, there still is a need for the A series because it represents a significant share of Pixels in markets. Assuming the A series continues to shrink in share, Ubrani says that then, in the next few iterations, it may make sense to discontinue it. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s important to realize that the A series doesn\u2019t just bring in a different customer due to the significantly lower price point, it also provides a healthy bump to overall Pixel brand marketing during the year when there\u2019s usually a bit of a slump in the middle of the year,\u201d he said. So, if we were to continue with the trajectory of a base Pixel model and one that is part of the A series, then I think Google really needs to figure out a way to differentiate the base model. We know from some recent leaks that the Pixel 10 will have a few more upgrades that make it stand out a little more than it has in the past. The biggest potential change is a triple-camera setup. And if Google choses to include that third camera, then it has to make sure that a third camera isn\u2019t also happening in a future Pixel 10a, otherwise, we\u2019ll be back to square one of what is the point of having these two phones.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"ByBill Curtis  ByBill Curtis,  Contributor.  Qualcomm is putting the pieces in place to shift edge AI systems from custom embedded mashups to ... More scalable, AI-enhanced computing platforms. AI is expanding beyond the cloud, turbocharging industrial equipment and computing systems at the edges of enterprise networks \u2014 and Qualcomm is hitting the gas. On March 10, Qualcomm agreed to buy Edge Impulse, a leading provider of AI development tools for IoT and embedded devices. With a community of over 170,000 developers and a history of over 474,000 machine learning projects, this acquisition jumpstarts Qualcomm\u2019s edge AI software ecosystem. But that\u2019s only part of the story. The company is transforming edge AI systems from custom embedded mashups to scalable, AI-enhanced computing platforms, as evidenced by these recent milestones: These milestones address edge scalability problems that have plagued IoT products for over a decade, paving the way for AI at the edge. The result is an AI-focused industrial edge platform that lets software developers focus on applications rather than OS customizations, system configurations, security subsystems, DevOps toolchains and AI workflows. Here\u2019s my analysis of this strategy, beginning with the business motivations for edge AI. While generative AI and large frontier models grab the spotlight, a quiet revolution is intensifying around the edges of our computing universe. AI is finding its way into the world all around us. Smaller, domain-optimized AI models, hosted by a wide variety of IoT devices, bring intelligence to all kinds of products \u2014 industrial, robotic, wearable, vehicular, agricultural, smart home, smart city, healthcare and human interface, to name a few. AI at the edge is growing rapidly, and here I\u2019ll explain why. According to an unsubstantiated legend, when a reporter asked notorious bank robber Willie Sutton why he robbed banks, he replied, \u201cBecause that\u2019s where the money is.\u201d Likewise, if you ask CIOs of enterprises with physical assets why they are betting big on edge AI, they\u2019ll probably say, \u201cBecause that\u2019s where the data is.\u201d Edge intelligence integrates real-time operations data with enterprise analytics, transforms resource planning from reactive to proactive, expands the scope of industrial automation from individual machines to process orchestration, and upgrades human roles from operators to innovators. These and other benefits promise significant ROI from investments in edge AI. AI-powered, cloud-based ERP, BI, CRM and SCM applications already grab data from edge IoT infrastructure, so why add AI to the complex, rugged, fragmented world of operational technologies? Why not just bring the data to the AI, rather than extend AI to the data? Here are five good reasons: In addition, conversational AI chatbots, agents and virtual assistants enable employees to interact with automated systems using natural languages, gestures and physical activities rather than keyboards, control panels and GUIs. AI is a new UI for integrated industrial operations, making employees more effective, reducing training time and providing in-context assistance when and where needed. The business cases are compelling, so what\u2019s holding back a wave of edge AI applications? OT diversity is the biggest reason. Unlike the uniform, button-down IT world, OT devices must meet stringent requirements for disparate industries, environments, form factors and operational situations. Hence, OT products are typically customized, one-off designs with unique hardware and software configurations. The extreme diversity of embedded devices prevents large-scale OT platform evolution. Smartphones have app stores with plug-and-play applications, and PCs have thriving independent software vendor supply chains, but OT devices typically require customized, product-specific applications. There is no common platform for building, testing, securing, delivering and updating OT applications \u2014 hence, no embedded \u201capp store\u201d and no economy of scale for OT device software. Diversity is a fact of life for IoT and OT products \u2014 that will never change. Still, we can improve how we manage diversity by providing off-the-shelf, scalable platforms that span families of architecturally similar SoCs. Qualcomm is on the leading edge of OT platform evolution with essential components of an edge AI platform that lets developers focus on AI-enabled applications rather than embedded system engineering. The following sections explain how the Foundries.io OS, Dragonwing IQ series chips and Edge Impulse AI development tools comprise a scalable platform for edge AI. I\u2019ll also explain how the recently announced Palantir collaboration suggests the next step for this platform \u2014 a multivendor application ecosystem. Traditional software development on Linux-based edge (embedded) systems requires customizing system-level platform code such as OS components, hardware drivers, network stacks, security systems and lifecycle management services. System customization delays application development, wastes engineering resources on undifferentiated features and creates significant technical debt by saddling product companies with long-term system support, perpetual software updates and security liabilities. Foundries.io is a Linux lifecycle management company founded in 2017 and acquired by Qualcomm in 2024. The company\u2019s main product, Foundries Factory, is a \u201cDevSecOps\u201d (development, security, operations) toolchain that aims to be \u201cthe OS of every thing.\u201d The tools make it easy for application developers to create a Yocto-configured Linux OS distribution for use on the target product. The generated OS is production-ready, secure, open-source, cloud-supported and continuously updated. Foundries Factory lets embedded developers write production-ready application code immediately after unboxing the development kit, deploy the resulting software stack at scale and continually update the OS, applications, AI models and other components. I don\u2019t often write about branding initiatives, but Dragonwing isn\u2019t a typical fluffy institutional campaign. It\u2019s strategically significant because it defines a unique identity for Qualcomm\u2019s industrial products outside the consumer-facing Snapdragon umbrella, signaling portfolio alignment, focused innovation, unified messaging and a strong customer commitment. Edge AI is the forcing function driving industrial portfolio alignment, so this move makes perfect sense. Dragonwing IQ series and Q series industrial SoCs combine Kryo CPUs, Hexagon tensor processors (up to \u201c100 TOPS\u201d), Spectra image processors, Adreno GPUs, ECC memory (rare for this kind of product) and an \u201cMCU-like\u201d subsystem with an industrial-grade \u201csafety island\u201d (SAIL), plus all the usual function blocks to bring accelerated AI applications to physically demanding, high-reliability edge environments. Details are available here. Enterprises with physical assets derive significant business value from edge AI use cases such as production optimization, supply chain efficiency, predictive maintenance, quality monitoring, safety and compliance. In addition to improving productivity and reducing costs, these AI projects deliver significant ROI by transforming process automation from reactive to proactive and expanding enterprise resource planning from hindsight to foresight. However, these AI-powered applications require training and tuning custom AI models for each use case and physical environment. Developing those models is a bottleneck inhibiting the edge of the AI scale. Edge Impulse simplifies and accelerates edge AI model development, \u201cdemocratizing\u201d the process so that more developers with operational knowledge can participate. The company has cultivated a community of over 170,000 developers, which only scratches the surface. The strong ROI for edge AI means we need millions of people training edge AI models \u2014 domain experts, not just data scientists. The first spreadsheet applications democratized data analysis over 40 years ago, and now we need a similar approach to AI training. Edge Impulse simplifies and streamlines edge AI development from data collection through model deployment. The company\u2019s website has complete technical details about these workflows, but at a high level, the process flows through these steps: Broad industry acceptance of Edge Impulse requires supporting these workflows across many types of edge AI devices from multiple suppliers \u2014 not just Dragonwing. According to CEO Zach Shelby, the company will continue supporting a variety of hardware. He described a \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d approach: \u201cAdding support for Dragonwing gives us superpowers on that platform.\u201d Meanwhile, Dragonwing benefits from broad Edge Impulse adoption, which requires multivendor platform support, so this strategy makes sense. Shelby said it best at Embedded World: \u201cThere are five exhibit halls and thousands of vendors. That\u2019s the world of embedded systems.\u201d The Edge Impulse acquisition signals Qualcomm\u2019s commitment to industrial AI growth. And Edge Impulse will now have the resources to rapidly expand its user base beyond AI experts and enable people with operational expertise to develop and tune edge AI models. Based on the agreement just announced, Palantir is extending its Ontology operations data layer to the Dragonwing platform, enabling OT-driven real-time insights and bringing data-driven, proactive decisions to industrial environments, including remote locations. Qualcomm\u2019s Palantir collaboration proves the importance of the industrial edge platform strategy discussed in the \u201cThe Scalability Strategy . . .\u201d section above. It\u2019s a great example of bringing AI to the data rather than bringing the data to AI. Platforms enable ISVs like Palantir to support the daunting diversity of edge devices with little or no customization. Qualcomm is committed to enabling edge AI across the board with integrated tools, native OS support, built-in OTA updates, Dragonwing industrial AI SoCs and edge AI workflows. These investments add up to a platform for edge AI development and deployment that accelerates Dragonwing adoption, expands the developer community and has the potential to redefine the industrial IoT supply chain by enabling an ISV software ecosystem. Qualcomm\u2019s edge platform is a wake-up call for the embedded semiconductor industry. The days of selling bare metal chips are over. The future belongs to platforms that enable application developers to rapidly build secure, production-ready, edge AI applications with little or no system-level engineering \u2014 just like their cohorts in the IT and mobile sectors have done for decades. Product companies will use platforms, not build them. And Qualcomm is building those platforms.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"Freelance Journalist A new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) program, VanHelsingRaaS, has been making waves in the cybercrime community since its launch on March 7 2025. According to a new technical post by Check Point Research (CPR), within just two weeks, the service had infected three victims, demanding ransoms as high as $500,000. The program offers free access to reputable affiliates, while new affiliates must pay a $5000 deposit. Affiliates receive 80% of ransom payments, with the remaining 20% going to the RaaS operators. VanHelsingRaaS supports multiple platforms, targeting Windows, Linux, BSD, ARM and ESXi systems. Affiliates manage their attacks through an intuitive control panel and use the VanHelsing locker \u2013 a sophisticated encryption tool. The ransomware follows a strict rule: it does not encrypt systems in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, a common practice among Russian cybercriminal groups. First detected by CPR on March 16 2025, VanHelsing ransomware is written in C++ and includes command-line arguments for precise control over the encryption process.

More market with price volatility as a storm disturbing the economy with 3D illustration elements. Before the current conflagration, I appeared on David Linn\u2019s financial podcast and was asked what I expected from the new presidential administration. I said the only certainty was increased volatility, which meant a high possibility of either great outcomes or the opposite. While the markets are signaling bad news, it is difficult to predict the outcome in isolation because we are all far from the machinations that will drive it. I\u2019m now a major bear, but the market doesn\u2019t listen to me \u2013 I need to listen to the market. Only a fool thinks they are never wrong. Success in the market comes from the flexibility to adapt and pivot with changing circumstances. Beyond mere malleability, it requires tools that highlight shifts in market dynamics. Let me give you an example: gold. Gold moves before we understand why, serving as a strong indicator that something ominous is on the horizon. Bitcoin behaves similarly but in a different way. Gold signals that bad strategic developments are unfolding behind the scenes, while bitcoin reflects acute crises bubbling to the surface. Whether the issue is chronic or acute, these assets react before the news breaks \u2013 by the time the headlines arrive, the market has already adjusted. These are examples of leading indicators. Right now, we need leading economic indicators. Here is an example from a recent article: Defense stocks: U.S. decling, European rising  U.S. defense stocks fall, and suddenly, European defense stocks rise. Who knew? It takes an idealist to believe that the new U.S. stance on global defense was a surprise to insiders around the time of the election results. It could be a coincidence, but\u2026 Setting that aside, are there more such signals? Personally, I take a stoic view. While Marcus Aurelius wasn\u2019t trading the Nasdaq, he would have told you, \u201cChange what you can; what you can\u2019t change, accept.\u201d So instead, I\u2019ll listen to the market and see if it can help me avoid the worst of whatever is coming. The key question is: Will the market crash, or will it hold at a correction level and bounce? Let\u2019s look for a leading indicator. A crash and ensuing recession or depression will hurt some businesses more than others. Economic downturns and conflict will especially impact one sector: luxury. The post-COVID era has fueled unprecedented demand for $40,000 handbags, multimillion-dollar watches, and seven-figure hypercars. I must admit to owning a few that I love, but the point remains \u2013 this froth is the first to disappear if the global economy\u2019s foundation crumbles. Luxury brand companies will deflate like a souffl\u00e9. If they don\u2019t, it\u2019s strong evidence that the 3D chess players have gotten it right and that things are going to be great \u2013 absolutely tremendous, believe me, no one will have seen anything like it. So here is the chart you need to watch: LVMH, a colossus of luxury: Luxury goods manufacturer LMVH: the chart to watch It\u2019s already 20% down, just a few percentage points from what is considered a crash for an index. However, this is what I will be watching: The levels to look for in the LMVH chart Simply put, if LVMH breaches these levels, the market is strongly indicating we are headed into a global recession, and a crash is underway. Savvy investors in luxury will be the first to bolt for the exits, making LVMH one of the first buffaloes to stampede off the cliff. If it holds, then the slump may not materialize. This is my \u2018canary in the coal mine.\u2019 I do have a couple of bullish considerations to keep in mind, even in the face of a potential downturn. Central banks will do their best to prevent a collapse. The Fed has already halted tightening and is fully capable of restarting QE. While not a panacea, this could provide a buffer against a market rout. Finally, I see a sentiment emerging in the investor community that reminds me of crypto-bros when bitcoin crashes \u2013 a wave of denial and bargaining. This is a bearish signal, as it suggests a large, na\u00efve cohort of investors with herd instincts, a volatile group often associated with major slumps. The U.S. tariff denouement approaches, and whatever unfolds, one thing is for sure: volatility will be elevated. If you\u2019re holding, you need to decide now how you plan to navigate the next few months. It\u2019s better to be wrong than unprepared. For me, it\u2019s cash, precious metals, agriculture, and steel. Yes, I am that bearish.","label":1}

Garcia served as a political appointee in Trump\u2019s Commerce Department from 2017 to 2018\u2014The Washington Post reported at the time that he left after being denied a permanent security clearance, a report a spokesperson for Garcia told Forbes was \u201ccategorically false.\u201d Garcia is now the CEO of Health Supply US, which has received $179 million in government contracts, primarily from the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security for personal protective equipment. Garcia is also a consultant for the Livingston Group, a government relations firm, where he helps \u201cclients in navigating complex domestic and international business and policy arenas,\u201d although Senate records show he has not registered as a lobbyist since 2021. A spokesperson for Garcia told Forbes that the purchase was an arm\u2019s-length transaction and the offer was based solely on market factors, adding that Garcia has no relationship with the seller and there was never any direct communication between the two. A spokesperson for Vance did not respond to a request for comment. Garcia\u2019s spokesperson said the purchase had no connection to his government work or political ties, and called any suggestion otherwise incorrect. Vance\u2019s home went on the market in February, shortly after he was sworn in as vice president and moved into the official residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory. While Vance lived there, the home was owned by a shell company called Del Ray Farmhouse LLC. That company was formed in Delaware in January 2023 and registered to do business in Virginia weeks later, just before buying the property. On its business registration in Virginia, the LLC\u2019s principal office address is listed as the home\u2019s address. Government documents from the business\u2019s registrations and the real estate transactions do not associate any individuals with the LLC, but neighbors confirmed to Forbes that Vance lived there and believe he is the beneficial owner. Despite the sale price being $170,000 over asking, Garcia did not appear to pay more than the market price for the home. The $1.9 million purchase price works out to $642 per square foot\u2014below the $741 per square foot average of 10 comparable Alexandria homes sold in 2024, according to city data. $1.3 million: The amount Health Supply US has spent lobbying the federal government since 2021, according to disclosures filed with the Senate. Vance was worth an estimated $10 million as of November 2024, according to Forbes calculations. Alexandria is a liberal city, with then-Vice President Kamala Harris capturing 77% of the vote in 2024. When Forbes asked a neighbor in 2024 if Vance had friends in the area, they replied, \u201cNo, God, no, no.\u201d Earlier this month, Trump ordered the Minority Business Development Agency\u2014the office Garcia briefly led during his Commerce Department tenure\u2014to be eliminated to the fullest extent allowed by law.

{"date":"2025-03-24","content":"ByDavid Brown  ByDavid Brown,  Forbes Councils Member.  David Brown is the founder and President at Mindshape. He is a senior advisor on brand, advertising and customer growth strategies.   Ask any seasoned marketer about the principal purpose of advertising, and they will likely say it\u2019s to drive greater brand awareness, sales and enduring trust in the hearts and minds of their target audience\u2014at least, that\u2019s what you hope they\u2019d say. However, in today\u2019s hyper-targeted, always-on market, there is increasing pressure on marketers to prioritize immediate short-term sales results over longer-term brand-building strategies. Over the past two decades, the appeal of performance-based strategies has been undeniable. Their ability to provide measurable results, optimize costs, offer real-time campaign flexibility and target specific audiences has dominated the advertising space. Yet, the pendulum may be shifting back toward a more balanced approach. Studies indicate that many consumers are experiencing ad fatigue due to the saturation of performance advertising. In fact, a Nielsen study revealed that 64% of consumers actively take steps to avoid ads. According to a study by Psychology & Marketing, consumers perceive online advertising as intrusive, particularly when it involves the use of private data, leading to negative attitudes toward both the ad platform and the advertised brand. Brand building shapes perception and creates emotional connections. Consider brands such as Apple or Coca-Cola\u2014they don\u2019t just sell products; they sell a lifestyle, a philosophy and a feeling. They achieve this through storytelling, consistent messaging and cultural relevance. Performance advertising, on the other hand, is more transactional. It focuses on immediate impact\u2014clicks, conversions, leads and revenue. Digital ads, paid search and retargeting campaigns fall into this category. These tactics leverage data and analytics to target the right audience at the right time, driving measurable business outcomes. In my experience leading strategies and campaigns across multiple verticals, from consumer to B2B, the formula for success has always been about emotion, relevance and action. How these core principles are infused into an idea may vary depending on the category, audience or objective. However, what remains constant is the need to invest in top-line brand building through emotion and relevance to drive the lower-funnel actions that lead to conversions and sales. This concept is not new, but it has taken a back seat as finance-driven marketing has prioritized short-term gains over long-term brand advocacy. The Multiplier Effect, a study published by WARC, highlights that businesses overly reliant on performance advertising might see a 20% to 50% reduction in ROI. Conversely, integrating brand and performance marketing can boost ROI by 25% to 100%, with an average lift of 90%. This finding reinforces the work of Les Binet and Peter Field, who identified that advertising becomes more effective as it moves further away from rational messaging toward pure emotion. Their research suggests that the optimal advertising mix is 60% brand building and 40% activation. The key lies in integrating both strategies through consistent messaging and themes. While performance marketing is rooted in data, brand-building success requires different measurements. Brands should evaluate their effectiveness beyond immediate conversions by tracking: \u2022 Brand Awareness & Recall: Are consumers recognizing and remembering your brand? \u2022 Brand Reputation & Sentiment Analysis: What are your audience's perceptions, feelings and attitudes toward your brand? \u2022 Price Premium: What is the perceived value of your brand? Brands with a positive perception often command premium prices, indicating a higher perceived value. \u2022 Brand Mentions & Reviews: How often is your brand discussed in forums? Metrics such as Net Promoter Score (NPS), online reviews, word-of-mouth (WOM) and social Share of Voice (SOV) provide insight. \u2022 Customer Lifetime Value (CLV): Are customers returning and remaining loyal? People want to be entertained, not sold to. That requires crafting consistent stories across all channels. I often consider the simplicity and lasting resonance of nursery rhymes. We hear them at an early age, yet they stay with us throughout our lives. That\u2019s the power of storytelling and consistency\u2014our brains are wired to form deeper beliefs and trust when we are exposed to consistent experiences that reinforce emotional associations. Consumers engage with brands across multiple touchpoints\u2014social media, digital ads, emails, print and in-store experiences. Disjointed messaging can erode trust, while a cohesive brand voice forms those deeper beliefs and strengthens recognition and loyalty. Applying integrated strategies ensures that every interaction\u2014whether online, offline, in-store or through word-of-mouth\u2014reinforces the brand story. The real question isn\u2019t whether brand building or performance marketing is more important\u2014it\u2019s how they can work together. As AI, predictive analytics and automation reshape consumer interactions, media consumption will only continue to grow. Brands that strike the 60:40 balance between emotional brand building and actionable performance tactics will be far more successful in driving short-term sales while fostering long-term trust and loyalty.
