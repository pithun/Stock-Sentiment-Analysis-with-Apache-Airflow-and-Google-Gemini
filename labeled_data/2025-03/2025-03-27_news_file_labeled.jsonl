Xbox controllers have changed less and less with each generation. So much so that the newest model that launched with the Xbox Series X is nearly indistinguishable from the previous generation. Is this because of a lack on innovation on Microsoft\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part? Heck no, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the opposite. The Xbox controller has been perfected. There is no more room for innovation because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already the best controller on the market. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a PC gamer, you have a plethora of options to choose from for games that require a gamepad. You can go with a first party controller from PlayStation or Nintendo, or even a wide range of solid third party options. But there is no need, because the Xbox core controller is simply the best. The Xbox core controller is currently up to 30% off, now $45 down from $65. See at Amazon The Xbox controller\u00c2\u00a0is sculpted with ergonomic flawlessness, comfortable to hold for long hours of playtime. The hybrid D-pad and textured grip on the triggers, bumpers, and back case provide tactile feedback while you game. The Xbox core controller supports Xbox Wireless as well as Bluetooth, allowing you to easily pair and switch between devices. That includes and Xbox console like the Series X | S or Xbox One as well as Windows PCs, Androids, iOS devices, and even a Samsung TV. The color options are wonderful with but loud options like the sky cipher, vapor pink, or electric volt, but there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also some more subtle choices available like the carbon black or the robot white. The Xbox core controller may not have some of the bells and whistles that the PS5 DualSense has like a touchpad or adaptive triggers, but so few games even use those effectively. Plus it just skyrockets the price tag to cover the costs of these unnecessary features. Want to know what the\u00c2\u00a0craziest feature the Xbox core controller has? It\u2019s the 3.5mm headset jack. That\u2019s right, you can plug in any compatible headset to easily talk with friend over Xbox Live without the unreliability that wireless connections can sometimes cause. Good ol\u2019 reliable AUX input. Oh how I love you. The Xbox core controller is an an easy $65 when at full price, but right now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s even discounted by 30%. That means it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only $45 for the best console and PC controller on the market. The Shock Blue is currently going for the lowest price, but you\u2019ll also find some pretty decent discounts on the Electric Volt and Robot White.

Store View is supposed to help Instacart determine which products are out of stock and when they may become available. by  Emma Roth Instacart is introducing a new way for shoppers to make money: taking videos of store shelves \u201cone aisle at a time.\u201d The new earning opportunity, called Store View, will allow Instacart to determine which products are available, as well as which ones are out of stock. Instacart says Store View will also help its predictive models estimate when a store will restock a particular product. \u201cIf you place an order at night for early next-day delivery, we can predict whether the item is likely to be back on the shelves when the store reopens, and then verify that information in the morning,\u201d Instacart explains. Instacart confirmed it was testing this feature earlier this year. The company will launch Store View with select retailers in the coming weeks, but plans to bring it to more stores in the US and Canada during 2025. In the future, Instacart says its smart Caper Carts will have the ability to keep track of stock, too. The outward-facing camera on the Caper Carts will soon give stores an \u201cunderstanding of inventory down to the store level,\u201d allowing Instacart to update stock levels as often as every hour of the day.  Along with Store View, Instacart is rolling out Second Store Check in the coming months, which Instacart bills as a way to \u201csource out-of-stock items from another location\u201d of the retailer you select. If you order an item but a shopper can\u2019t find it in-store, Instacart will automatically prompt a second shopper to check if it\u2019s available at another store. The second shopper will then deliver the item \u201cfor no additional service or delivery fee,\u201d but customers will have the option to leave a tip.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Business Insider Edition  Elon Musk's Tesla has been admitted into the Gulf's largest economy, Saudi Arabia, at a crucial time for the electric vehicle producer.          On Wednesday, Tesla announced it will be holding a launch event in Saudi Arabia's capital, Riyadh, on April 10.               \"You and your family are warmly invited to our launch event at the Bujairi Terrace on April 10,\" the announcement on Tesla's website read.               \"Experience the future of autonomous driving with Cybercab, and meet Optimus, our humanoid robot, as we showcase what's next in AI and robotics,\" it added.               The announcement said a Tesla team will be on hand to answer questions regarding Tesla ownership, home charging, and more.               Musk has had a testy relationship with Saudi Arabia.               In August 2018, Musk wrote on Twitter \u2014 now X \u2014 that he would be taking Tesla private.               \"Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured,\" Musk wrote.               In a company blog at the time, Musk wrote that he had met with representatives from Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund. The meetings started in early 2017 after he expressed interest in taking Tesla private, Musk added.               The deal did not take place after the PIF did not commit any funding.               Musk and Tesla were sued by Tesla investors, who said Musk's premature announcement caused them to lose money. During the trial, Musk blamed the PIF for \"backpedaling\" on their plans.               Then, in 2018, the PIF announced a $1 billion investment into Tesla's rival, Lucid Motors.               Saudi Arabia opening its doors to Tesla comes at a critical time for the EV maker, which has seen its stock price plunge by over 40% from its record highs in mid-December.               Tesla's shares closed at about $272 on Wednesday, down from a peak closing price of $479 in December.               The company has lost its spot as the world's top EV manufacturer, with Chinese EV giant BYD's revenue outpacing Tesla's in 2024.               BYD recently unveiled chargers that it says are four times more powerful than Tesla's and can charge an EV in five minutes.               On Tuesday, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said Tesla's sales in Europe have fallen by 42% in the first two months of the year.               Representatives for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"In the era of digital streaming, the market is full of wireless speakers that will play content from your smartphone or pull it down from the Internet directly over WiFi. But if you\u2019re feeling a bit nostalgic and want to throw on one of your old CDs, well, you might have a problem. That\u2019s the situation [Chad Boughton] recently found himself in, so he decided to build a compact CD player that could discreetly connect up to his fancy Klipsch speaker. The optical drive itself was the easy part, as [Chad] already had a laptop-style drive in an external enclosure that he could liberate. But of course, the speaker wouldn\u2019t know what to do with an external disc drive, so there needed to be an intermediary. Enter the Raspberry Pi. It might not look like it at first glance, but that\u2019s a Pi 3 tucked into the back of the 3D printed frame. It would have been too tall in its original configuration, so [Chad] removed the USB and Ethernet ports; a modification we\u2019ve covered in the past. Of course, he still needed to use the USB ports, so he ended up soldering the two cables \u2014 one to the CD drive and the other to the back of the speaker \u2014 directly to the Pi. When plugged into the Raspberry Pi, the Klipsch speaker shows up as a USB audio device, so the software side of things was relatively simple. [Chad] installed VLC to handle CD playback, but he still needed a way to control everything. To that end, a IR receiver hooked up to the Pi\u2019s GPIO pins means the Pi can detect the signals coming from the speaker\u2019s original remote and pass the appropriate command on to VLC. The whole thing is very well integrated, and you could be forgiven for thinking it might be some kind of stock upgrade module at first glance. Despite recently celebrating its 40th birthday, the CD is unlikely to completely disappear from our lives anytime soon. Manufacturers can turn their back on the standard if they want, but so long as folks still want to play them, they\u2019ll keep coming up with inventive ways to make it happen.   I just acquired a HP laptop CD drive from our E_Waste bin at work (they let me raid it from time to time) so maybe this article will inspire a project! This seems super overkill. Instead of a PI you can use an arduino to send IDE commands to the drive to play, stop, pause, skip track (if the cd drive is indeed IDE\u2026) Prolly a 555 would do? Do these laptop style optical drives even have analog output, because you\u2019d still need a DAC and some sort of processing in addition to the ide commands. It probably is way overkill using a pi but it\u2019s arguably the cheapest and easiest way to get a working prototype in under a few hours. Being a sucker for physical media I love it, my only complaint is it would look better with a slot loading cd player. but that\u2019s just aesthetics. My first thought too. I once modded an external slot loading drive by removing the top metal cover and replacing it with a piece of clear plexi. It looks really cool loading and playing a disc. I kind of want to recreate this project with that drive mounted vertically so you could watch the disc play. I have a sony micro system that does exactly this but it\u2019s quite bulky compared to how small a laptop optical drive is. I used to have a portable with it stripped down naked (danger!) so you snap on a disc first press play and see it spin up. That\u2019s close to a vinyl experience, see it slow down as it plays out. Loading mechanics with trays and slots are more of a problem than the reading head in my experience, because of rubber belts. Does that laptop CD drive has USB interface? I always thought they were SATA (or IDE). They are probably using a usb to sata\/ide adapter (like those found in enclosures for these drives) I\u2019ve always loved the gentle click they make when the drawer opens\u2026 Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Business Insider Edition  One homeowner has the chance to live above the clouds.          It'll only cost about $49 million.               A penthouse on the 107th and 108th floors of Dubai's iconic Burj Khalifa \u2014 a skyscraper with offices, a luxury hotel, and restaurants \u2014 is on the market for 180 million United Arab Emirates dirhams, or about $49 million.               The duplex home is nearly 2,300 feet off the ground, while the Burj Khalifa stands at 2,722 feet tall. For context, the Empire State Building is a mere 1,454 feet tall. New York City's Central Park Tower is the world's tallest primarily residential building at 1,550 feet; its penthouse previously held the highest title.               We don't even know how many bedrooms or bathrooms the 21,000-square-foot residence will hold \u2014 that'll be up to the buyer.               \"It hasn't got rooms or toilets or baths or kitchens or anything like that, so it's just concrete ceilings, concrete floors, and just glass all around,\" listing agent Asad Khan told Business Insider.               \"The type of person that would look at it would be an investor, who will take on the project and then obviously do the fit-out according to their requirements,\" Khan, of Invest Dubai Real Estate, added.               The duplex also comes with an indoor pool, a private elevator, and 12 parking spaces.               Khan's client, investor Karl Haddad, purchased the unit in 2020 for an undisclosed amount from Mohamed Alabbar, a founder of Emaar Properties, which developed the Burj Khalifa.               Haddad, the chairman and CEO of IRC Invest, doesn't have the time to build out the unit because he's busy with other projects, Khan said.               When he officially listed the duplex earlier this year, Khan added, he was \"overwhelmed\" by the amount of Americans who expressed interest.               Managers and agents of athletes, from basketball players to NASCAR drivers, have requested more information about the home, Khan told BI.               One of them wasboxing legendFloyd Mayweather, he added.               \"They're from various walks of life,\" Khan said. \"We had a huge amount of inquiries in the US \u2014 and I don't know why that is.\"               Recent government data shows that Dubai's population has jumped by 3.85 million people since March 2020 \u2014 and 87% of that increaseis expats.               The Burj Khalifa has 900 residential units ranging in price from 2.29 million United Arab Emirates dirhams (about $623,000) to 100 million United Arab Emirates dirhams (about $27.2 million), according to United Arab Emirates real-estate listings site Bayut.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Business Insider Edition  I figured that once I graduated from college, I would have no problem stepping into an entry-level position in journalism or publishing. I learned very quickly that the post-recession job market in 2011 had changed everything.          Since my partner and I had adopted our first child in college, I had a young family to support, so finding a job after graduation was important.               I moved my family from West Texas to Fort Worth so that I could access a larger job market, but the combination of idealistic naivety and unrealistic expectations got in the way of my job hunt. I soon found myself in places I never thought I would be: a job seeker event and, at one point, a food bank.               For the first few months after graduation, the stress of job-hunting and not having enough money to make ends meet affected my young family.               After several months of holding back, I finally broke down and decided to apply for a job at the Chick-fil-A close to our house. I landed an interview quickly and was immediately offered an entry-level cashier position.               Before I knew it, I was dressed in full Chick-fil-A red and black, standing at the ready and asking customers what types of sauces they wanted with their nuggets.               No, I wasn't \"living my best life\" or harnessing the American dream, but that wasn't the point. I was making money for my family. Plus, the job both humbled and empowered me.               It wasn't easy for me to settle into the restaurant position since my hopes had been firmly set on a salary with benefits.               I was a college graduate working a job I never saw myself doing. At times, I felt like I had taken a step in the wrong direction. I found myself struggling with anger and frustration.               However, once I overcame my frustration, I noticed the real benefits of my gig.               For example, I worked with some inspiring people: high school students putting themselves out there to get some work experience, the cooks who took me under their wing (and caught me up on my Spanish), and our store owner who cared about people over profit.               It felt good to earn for my family in a positive environment while I waited to determine my next step.               Taking that job in a fast-food restaurant didn't solve all of our problems, but it gave me a new outlook on postgrad life.               While it wasn't my dream job, I could make a monthly wage, giving me the breathing room to look for other work opportunities that made sense for a recent college graduate.               It took patience and willingness to work while waiting for another opportunity. In doing so, the job also taught my family a powerful lesson: If we can approach tough situations with the willingness to do what it takes with humility, we're more likely to survive our struggles.               Being willing to take the opportunities in front of you, even if they don't feel like enough at the time, can lead to what you need.               After working at Chick-fil-A for eight months, I found work more closely aligned with my career goals.               Thanks to my short stint in the service industry, I now own a coffee company in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The journey has also led my partner into her private practice as a clinical therapist. Not only have our careers grown, but 13 years later, our family has grown from three to six.               I am deeply grateful for our family's Chick-fil-A era because I learned a lot while responding to customers with \"my pleasure.\"               It was my pleasure, in the end, to have the opportunity for growth and the ability to lay a healthy foundation for our family.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"The Nintendo Switch 2 is going to be a big launch. We can estimate that based on hype alone, but wondering how big the launch will be is asking the wrong question. The main consideration with the Switch 2 is if the entire games industry will finally learn the right lesson from Nintendo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success. Nintendo is holding off detailing the Switch 2\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full capabilities and its release window until April 2 (not even a whiff of \u00e2\u0080\u009c2\u00e2\u0080\u009d at today\u2019s Nintendo Direct). On release date, the legacy Japanese gamemaker will have shown the industry what it\u2019s been missing these last few, tumultuous years wracked by studio closures, layoffs, and cancelled games. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all about keeping things fun for the players, not obsessing over obscene graphical capabilities of every new console. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Switch 2 will do well, but it is the answer to a lot of Nintendo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s existing issues as well as the video game industry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s issues overall,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Joost van Dreunen, a longtime games market researcher and professor at NYU\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Stern School of Business, told Gizmodo in a phone interview. While the other major players in games, especially Sony and Microsoft, try to entice consumers with more-capable processors and components, \u00e2\u0080\u009cNintendo doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play that game at all,\u00e2\u0080\u009d van Dreunen said. The industry expert said that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily mean Nintendo will sell as many Switch 2 units as it did the original Switch at launch, but it will likely sell enough. A sentiment backed by Japan-based analyst Serkan Toto who told Bloomberg Nintendo will sell \u00e2\u0080\u009cboatloads\u00e2\u0080\u009d of Switch 2s in the first month of sale. Nintendo sold a total of 150 million Switch consoles over its 8-year lifespan, according to Nintendo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s February earnings report. The Switch 2 just needs to justify itself as an upgrade for Switch owners, one that shows off Nintendo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reputation for being the \u00e2\u0080\u009cfun, weird, and wonky\u00e2\u0080\u009d console-maker. All Nintendo has to do is promise moderate upgrades such as 4K capabilities\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps with the help of AI upscaling\u00e2\u0080\u0094and players may already perceive it as the boost the aging Switch hardware needed. But there is one thing that could get in the way. The price. Rumors suggest the Switch 2 could cost $400, $100 more than the Switch at launch and $50 more than the Switch OLED. That\u2019s still $100 less than the PlayStation 5 ($300 less than the PS5 Pro) or Xbox Series X. But Nintendo can\u2019t afford to go much higher in price. Van Dreunen suggested the sequel Switch may be in trouble if it edges too close to $500 as Nintendo\u2019s target audience skews toward those without deep pockets. Particularly because its competitor isn\u2019t the Steam and Windows handhelds that resemble it. The Steam Deck OLED starts at $550 and comes with the promise of playing most of your PC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Steam library on the go. PC gamers on the whole have more cash to burn than Switch buyers, and they can end up with both devices in their living rooms, van Dreunen said. Research from analyst firm IDC commissioned by The Verge shows that all handheld PCs makers combined have sold close to 6 million units over the past three years. Some analysts expect Nintendo to hit that number in a third of that time. Japanese video game industry analyst Robin Zhu of UBS told Bloomberg that Nintendo may have a total inventory of 6 to 8 million new handheld consoles at release. \u00a0 The Switch 2 has been cooking for so long, Nintendo should have had time to prepare for this moment. The last big gaming hardware launch, Nvidia\u2019s RTX 50-series GPU launch, has been a disaster for several reasons,\u00c2\u00a0mostly due to fact you can\u2019t buy one for anywhere close to the suggested retail price. Compared to Nvidia, Nintendo has openly talked about plans for having enough stock for launch. On two separate occasions, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa told investors that the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans to beat scalpers was to have enough supply for anybody who wants a Switch 2 to buy one. And while the entire tech industry is shaking in its boost over the threat of Trump tariffs its unclear how it might affect the Switch 2 launch. Some companies have already raised prices, while others have delayed big product releases planned for this spring. At a press conference (as reported by Reuters and translated by NintendoEverything) Furukawa said they \u00e2\u0080\u009canticipate a certain impact\u00e2\u0080\u009d from tariffs and the company is \u00e2\u0080\u009cestablishing ways to respond.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The company expects \u00e2\u0080\u009cminimal\u00e2\u0080\u009d impact to its financial results. Van Dreunen said he expects Nintendo already fast-tracked production and shipments to the U.S. to avoid tariff threats. Planning and preparation go hand-in-hand with Nintendo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s philosophy. A $400 Switch 2 will sell, if for no other reason than for brand loyalty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake. But for the rest of us gamers, the Switch 2 is a good marker for the gaming industry to inspect itself. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need more and more AAA games with ludicrous budgets that demand $70 or even $100 from consumers. What we need is an industry that better balances cool features with affordability. Games don\u2019t have to be a luxury product, especially when we\u2019re staring down the barrel of rising prices and economic uncertainty. Nintendo\u2019s formula long proved it works. More companies should take note.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Business Insider Edition  Nvidia's blockbuster year has been good news for its CEO, Jensen Huang.  Nvidia earnings were strong in 2024, and the company's stock price has been up in the first quarter of the year.               Huang, who cofounded the company in 1993 and has served as its president and CEO ever since, has seen his net worth balloon as the chipmaker's market cap rises.               In 2024, he broke into Forbes' list of the top 10 richest people for the first time ever. His net worth today is approximately $106 billion, according to the ranking.               Now leading one of the Magnificent 7 companies, Huang has come a long way from his first job washing dishes and cleaning toilets at Denny's.               Here's a closer look at how Huang built and spends his fortune:               As of March 2024, Huang owned roughly 3.79% of the company's outstanding shares, according to a proxy statement. He is the company's largest individual shareholder.               Before starting Nvidia, Huang worked at computer chip manufacturer LSI Logic and at semiconductor company AMD, which is today helmed by his distant cousin, Lisa Su.   Huang received a total compensation package of $34.2 million for fiscal year 2024, which included a base salary of $996,514, as well as $26.7 million in stock awards, $4 million in cash bonuses, and $2.5 million for other expenses, including residential security and car and driver services.               His pay package was up 60% from the fiscal year prior, when it was $21.4 million.               Huang undertook a prearranged trading plan in 2024 to sell 6 million shares by the end of the first quarter of 2025; as a result, he offloaded roughly $700 million worth of Nvidia shares.               Huang's total compensation for 2024 was pretty middle of the pack compared to other tech CEOs of the Mag 7 companies.               He's one of roughly 15 centibillionaires identified on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.               At 62 years old, Huang is older than some of his Big Tech peers, such as Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Google's Sundar Pichai, and Amazon's Andy Jassy, but younger than others, such as Apple's Tim Cook.               As far as real estate is concerned, he has owned property in California, as Nvidia has headquarters in Santa Clara, as well as Hawaii.               He isn't known for many ostentatious splurges, but Huang's leather jacket is a staple of his wardrobe. He has worn several over the years at high-profile events, including one lizard-embossed jacket that appeared to be from Tom Ford's spring 2023 collection and retailed for $8,990.               Huang has also given some of his fortune to philanthropic causes. In 2007, he and his wife established the Jen-Hsun and Lori Huang Foundation.               They've given $50 million to Oregon State University, which subsequently named a research center for the couple, both of whom are OSU alums.               The couple donated $30 million to Stanford University, from which Huang received his master's degree, for an engineering center. They've also given $22.5 million to the California College of the Arts.               An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment.

The free version of Proton VPN allows users to connect to servers in five randomly selected countries and provides \u201cmedium VPN speed.\u201d Vivaldi browser users can also upgrade to a paid version of Proton VPN starting from $10 per month, which provides faster VPN speeds, the ability to choose which servers to connect to across more than 110 countries, and other additional features. It isn\u2019t unique for web browsers to have VPN features baked in \u2014 Microsoft bolstered its Edge browser with the Edge Secure Network VPN, for example. Proton VPN can also be readily embedded into other web browsers like Chrome and Firefox via downloadable browser extensions.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Business Insider Edition  Boeing may finally be on an upward trajectory as it claws its way back into the good graces of investors and customers.          Since January, the manufacturer has been firing on all cylinders, securing a lucrative defense contract for the US's new F-47 fighter jet and scoring billions of dollars' worth of new passenger plane orders.               Deliveries are looking good, too. Analysts estimate that post-strike 737 production is at higher-than-expected levels in the first quarter so far.               The wins in two critical business segments are set to help bring in more cash, boost employee morale, and attract and retain engineering talent as the company works to right itself after a tough 2024.               Boeing's stock price has rallied about 16% over the past six months, nearly recovering from a March low, even as the broader market has pulled back amid tariff concerns and overall economic uncertainty. Shares remain down significantly from a 2023 high.               Analysts appear optimistic, with an average future price target of $196, or about 10% above Wednesday's closing price.               On Wednesday, Korean Air finalized its order for 20 Boeing 777X planes. The news followed respective orders by Japan Airlines and Malaysia Airlines for 17 and up to 60 new 737 Max aircraft.               Both models are incredibly important for Boeing. The 777X is at least six years behind schedule \u2014 with its launch now expected in 2026 \u2014 and 737 Max output is capped at 38 a month.               Still, the deals add to Boeing's more than 6,000-strong backlog and signal customer confidence after aircraft deliveries slowed in 2024.               In a January earnings call, CEO Kelly Ortberg, who took over in August, said Boeing could achieve a 737 Max production rate of 42 a month by the end of the year, assuming it meets federally agreed-upon quality and safety metrics.               He also outlined a plan to close the 737 \"shadow factory\" \u2014 where already-built jets receive fixes to quality issues \u2014 which should further boost operational efficiency as workers can fully focus on the main assembly line.               Airline customers appear pleased with the progress. United Airlines CFO Michael Leskinen said at a February Barclays conference that he was confident in the Max delivery schedule.               \"Boeing is doing a pretty miraculous job of turning around and becoming more reliable as a supplier,\" he said.               President Donald Trump on Friday announced that Boeing secured a $20 billion contract to produce the sixth-generation US Air Force fighter jets, designated the F-47. The fleet will replace the F-22 Raptor.               Boeing beat out its rival manufacturer Lockheed Martin, which produces the US's fifth-generation F-35 fighter. Lockheed's stock has fallen about 6.5% since the Friday announcement.               JPMorgan analysts called the F-47 contract a \"shot in the arm\" for the future of Boeing's struggling defense business. The company has already suffered losses from its KC-46 tanker program and delayed Air Force One aircraft.               They said the financial benefits were \"clearly meaningful but not massive in the context of a recovered Boeing,\" noting the F-47 could bolster Boeing's position in the aerospace industry and help attract talent.               Analysts at Melius said the new program was also expected to boost Boeing's employee morale and help the company retain \"top engineering talent.\"               This could help lift the company out of a cultural slump created by the fallout from aircraft quality issues and a nearly eight-week labor strike. Ortberg has led the charge, outlining initiatives like putting executives on the factory floor.               \"Although Kelly Ortberg has been at the helm for less than a year, we believe he is the right leader to turn Boeing around,\" Melius analysts said in a note to clients. \"He has empowered employees to provide 'brutal' feedback on the company's leadership and culture, allowing him to implement necessary improvements.\"       Correction \u2014 March 27, 2025: An earlier version of this story misidentified United's CFO as Brian West. He is the CFO of Boeing, Michael Leskinen is the CFO of United.    Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Business Insider Edition  President Donald Trump announced a 25% tariff rate on all imported vehicles on Wednesday, and investors are spooked.          Most auto stocks moved lower on Thursday in reaction to the tariffs, with various automakers expected to be negatively affected by the higher prices.               The tariffs don't take effect until April 3, and there's a chance negotiations result in changes to the final rate or a narrowing of the scope.               But investors are shooting first and asking questions later. That's because the tariffs if fully enacted, could cost automakers tens of billions of dollars.               Of the roughly 16 million cars sold in America each year, about half are manufactured outside in other countries, and nearly all of them rely on foreign-made auto parts, which are also subject to the new tariffs.               JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman called the tariffs \"draconian\" in a note on Thursday and lowered his price targets for General Motors, Ford, and Ferrari as a result.               \"We are lowering our price targets for shares of General Motors, Ford, and Ferrari given the increased potential for material earnings risk from draconian auto tariffs that now seem likelier than ever to be imposed as soon as April 3,\" Brinkman said.               Brinkman estimates that the new tariffs could cost the auto industry $82 billion, double his prior estimate of $41 billion.               Here are the biggest losers from the Trump auto tariffs, based on Thursday's price action.       General Motors stock declined about 7% on Thursday, after dropping 3% on Wednesday. The company relies heavily on manufacturing its vehicles in Canada and Mexico.               While Ford is better insulated from the tariffs than General Motors thanks to its domestic manufacturing plants, it still stands to take a sizable earnings hit, ranging from $2 billion to $4.5 billion, according to JPMorgan. The stock dropped 4% on Thursday.               European automakers were slammed on Thursday, including luxury manufacturers like BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Porsche. Shares of all three companies declined by about 3%.               While the Trump tariffs are expected to raise the price of autos across the board, some manufacturers are better insulated, including Tesla and Rivian, which manufacture the bulk of their vehicles domestically.       Tesla and Rivian stock both jumped about 2% on Thursday.               Shares of Ferarri initially dropped 3% in Thursday trades, as the company makes all of its vehicles in Italy.               But the stock quickly rebounded and rose as much as 3% after the company announced it would implement a 10% price increase on some of its vehicle models.               Analysts at Bernstein argued that Ferarri's high net-worth client base would most likely be unmoved by the higher prices.        Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Business Insider Edition  A lot of people are looking for work right now, and while that's great news for employers, it puts job seekers in a tough spot.          If you're blaming yourself for not getting a job despite actively looking, keep in mind there are factors outside your control in a job market with more competition and slower hiring than a couple of years ago.               Veteran recruiters and labor market analysts told Business Insider those factors include many people applying for the same role, not enough workers to review applications, and low demand in the field you're applying for.               \"We're in a situation where it is harder for people to find a new job because the balance of power has shifted back toward employers,\" Daniel Zhao, the lead economist at Glassdoor, said, adding that hiring has been sluggish and more like the 2010s than the booming market of a couple of years ago.               Kathleen Nolan, who's been a technical recruiter for about seven years, knows how tough the job market is. She said in a LinkedIn post that she recently reassured a job seeker she rejected that it was the job market, not him.               Nolan thinks companies \"are only opening roles when and if they are truly needed, and they are doing their best to not pad head count more than necessary.\"               \"If you've never had a problem getting a job before and suddenly you do, you can't look at it and think, 'I'm the problem,'\" Nolan said. \"You've got to look at what's going on around you.\"               Some industries have more opportunities than others. Zhao said healthcare is not as subject to the business cycle as other sectors. Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said there's a lot of hiring happening in that sector, while tech and other knowledge worker gigs aren't seeing as much hiring.               \"You don't choose what time you're in the job market, but you can choose which part of the job market you focus on,\" Zhao said.               For the jobs that are available, employers may not have enough hands to go through or respond to each applicant. Nolan said talent acquisition and similar roles took a hit during the pandemic, and companies haven't expanded these teams to their previous levels.               \"You have fewer people to go through more rsums and to fill fewer jobs, but it's still quite a bit of work,\" she said.               Bonnie Dilber, a recruiter for about a decade, said her current employer, a software company, had to pause an application for a job after getting 700 applicants within a few days of being posted. Dilber said many of the people were well qualified for the role.               \"It was just seeing that a lot of people who really have the skills and could probably do the job pretty well are not even going to be able to get interviews because there are just so many people who are also on the market competing for a small number of jobs,\" she said.               There could be things you can do to try to move along the job process.               Dilber recommends not applying to every job opening you see and instead focusing on postings you are \"well qualified\" for. \"Mass applying is actually hurting people because they're putting in lower-quality applications that aren't going to stand up in a competitive applicant pool,\" she said.               Nolan doesn't think there's a clear formula for standing out in the job search or getting that first interview. However, she recommends strategic networking, like reaching out to existing connections and to people you admire in your field of work.               \"Something that can sometimes be underrated is asking for what you want, putting it out there, whether it's on LinkedIn, whether it's writing an email to folks you might know in your industry,\" she said.               Nolan said your LinkedIn profile should be a version of your rsum because recruiters tend to check it in addition to rsums submitted.               Beyond doing the typical grunt work of finding a job, Nolan said to be patient and to take care of yourself. She said applying for work can be a full-time job.               \"Just like with your full-time job, it's important to set parameters so you don't get burned out,\" she said.               It's tough to say how the job market will continue to play out, even in the short term. Nolan is hopeful that things will improve soon.               \"We've been in tough spots in the market before,\" she said.       Do you have a story to share about job searching?

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"SignalGate, as it's come to be called, may be the biggest scandal to hit the Trump administration in its first months in power. But it's been great for Signal. Since the news broke on Monday that senior Trump administration cabinet members accidentally included the editor in chief of The Atlantic in a group chat on the Signal encrypted messaging platform where the officials were making secret plans to bomb Yemen, the ensuing news cycle and the constant mentions of Signal have led to the encrypted messaging platform doubling its usual rate of new downloads, the nonprofit organization that runs Signal tells WIRED. Given that 2025 has already been a \u201cbanner year\u201d for Signal's growth, according to Signal's leadership, that makes this week the single biggest bump in US adoption of the app in Signal's nearly 11 years of existence. \u201cIn Signal\u2019s history, this is the largest US-growth moment by a massive margin,\u201d says Jun Harada, Signal's head of growth and partnerships. \u201cIt\u2019s mind-blowing, even on our side.\u201d Harada declined to give absolute numbers for Signal's user growth beyond saying that its total downloads are in the \u201chundreds of millions,\u201d which has been the case for several years. But he said that the week\u2019s rate of adoption has been twice that of a typical week for 2025, which in turn was twice that of a typical week the same time last year. \u201cIt happened immediately\u201d after The Atlantic broke the story of Signal's use in the Yemeni bombing, Harada says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been sustained. We\u2019ve been maintaining that rate every day.\u201d In Signal's history, the only comparable spike in adoption occurred when WhatsApp changed its privacy policy in 2021, Harada says, leading to millions of users abandoning that communications app. But that incident mostly brought non-Americans to Signal, unlike the current, US-focused SignalGate bump. Numbers from the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower largely align with Signal's own analysis of that growth: The company says that Signal downloads in the US increased 105 percent compared to the prior week\u2014and 150 percent compared to an average week in 2024. Outside of the US, Sensor Tower saw only a 21 percent increase in Signal downloads compared to the prior week. The Atlantic's revelation on Monday that secretary of defense Pete Hegseth, director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, national security adviser Michael Waltz, vice president JD Vance, and other Trump administration officials used a Signal group chat to plan an air strike against Houthi rebels in Yemen\u2014and that Waltz accidentally added Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg to that group in a shocking breach of confidentiality\u2014has raised serious questions about the security practices of the Trump administration that are still resonating days later. The scandal has called into question whether the executive branch officials were planning the air strike using vulnerable non-approved or even personal devices rather than the secure machines intended for classified conversations. Screenshots of the group chat published by The Atlantic on Wednesday indicate that the officials were using Signal's disappearing messages feature to delete their communications, potentially in violation of US record retention laws. The incident has raised sometimes-misguided questions, too, about whether Signal itself is to blame for the breach\u2014including from President Trump, who suggested in comments on Wednesday that Signal might be \u201cdefective\"\u2014despite many cybersecurity and encryption experts' recommendation of Signal as the best end-to-end encrypted messaging tool freely available to the public. \u201cYou use Signal, we use Signal, everyone uses Signal,\u201d Trump told reporters, \u201cbut it could be a defective platform.\u201d Signal's Harada declined to respond to Trump's \u201cdefective\u201d comment and pointed to Signal's previous statements that it has yet to see any evidence of any vulnerability in the app, much less one that has anything to do with Jeffrey Goldberg being accidentally added to a White House group chat. But Harada noted that the overall attention to Signal\u2014even the president himself saying that \u201ceveryone uses Signal\u201d in the Oval Office\u2014is an example of the kind of visibility it has never had before. \u201cAll awareness for Signal is a net positive. The interest in Signal continues to be at an all-time high,\u201d Harada says. \u201cI don\u2019t think my phone has ever buzzed this much, from people from every walk of life. People are learning about Signal who maybe have never even heard about or considered encrypted messaging before.\u201d Harada also pointed to a report that Google searches for \u201cSignal\u201d were up more than 1,000 percent. Harada says that Signal was already seeing a significant uptick in adoption in the first few months of 2025. He attributes that growth partly to increasing general interest in privacy among consumers and partly to the breach of nine US telecoms by China's Salt Typhoon hacker group, which led to the hackers accessing some targets' real-time calls and texts. Federal officials at the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency responded to those breaches by publicly recommending that Americans use encrypted messaging and calling applications. But all of that has been dwarfed by the attention and interest Signal has received this week. As messy as SignalGate may be, Harada says, it has made Signal a household name like never before. \u201cTo have this kind of mainstream moment is massive,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe it\u2019s a sea change for private encrypted messaging for the US and the world.\u201d In your inbox: Upgrade your life with WIRED-tested gear How to avoid US-based digital services, and why you might want to The Big Story: Inside Elon Musk\u2019s \u2018digital coup\u2019 \u2018Airport theory\u2019 will make you miss your flight Special Edition: How to get computers\u2014before computers get you More From WIRED Reviews and Guides \u00a9 2025 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

It\u2019s a reversal from Garmin\u2019s previous stance toward paywalls, but at least existing features and data remain free. by  Victoria Song If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. It was only a matter of time. Garmin announced today it\u2019s launching Garmin Connect Plus, a premium tier to its app that adds AI-powered insights and a few other expanded features. Existing and new Garmin users will be able to opt in to a free 30-day trial and then choose between a $6.99 monthly or $69.99 annual subscription. All existing health data and features, however, will remain free. \u201cDeveloping a premium tier enables us to extend our investment in the Garmin Connect platform, both in terms of features that carry additional cost to provide and also in scaling out our engineering teams to build and maintain these features,\u201d says Garmin spokesperson Natalie Miller. AI is the big addition to Connect Plus. The feature, dubbed Active Intelligence, will roll out as a beta and purportedly delivers \u201cpersonalized insights and suggestions\u201d based on your health and activity data. Over time, the insights and goals are supposed to become more personalized to the individual user. That\u2019s about all the information Garmin has provided thus far about the AI-powered side of things, but it\u2019s on trend for fitness apps and wearable makers lately. Whoop was first to add an AI training coach in late 2023, while Strava also rolled out AI summaries for activities last year. Among bigger tech companies, Samsung added AI-powered insights while Google added AI-generated running workouts to its smartwatches last year. Oura also has added an AI wellness chatbot to its popular smart ring, as have several smaller wearable makers in the past two years. Garmin and Apple have thus far been the two major holdouts for wearable AI features, and with today\u2019s announcement, that leaves just Apple. Connect Plus also adds a new performance dashboard that lets users compare custom charts and graphs over a period of time to visualize progress. Subscribers will also be able to view live activity metrics on a smartphone for workouts that were started on a watch. LiveTrack will also be expanded so you can notify selected contacts when an activity starts and a personalized profile page for followers. People using Garmin Coach plans for running and cycling will also receive additional guidance from Garmin coaches. Lastly, there will be exclusive badges and frames for user\u2019s app profiles. Whether this is enough value to tempt loyal Garmin users is another question \u2014 especially since Garmin has been vocal in the past about not paywalling features. Back in 2022, I asked Phil McClendon, Garmin\u2019s project lead for the Venu 2 Plus, about the company\u2019s philosophy regarding subscriptions. At the time, McClendon told The Verge, \u201cWe\u2019re not charging you the ability to access your data, and that\u2019s something we will continue to do and that we feel very strongly about.\u201d McClendon is no longer at Garmin, and technically this is still true since all existing features and data will remain free. However, in the years since that conversation, Garmin has occasionally softened its messaging regarding paywalls. At a 2023 press briefing for the Venu 3, Garmin leadership noted that the company had robust subscriptions outside its fitness tracker business but declined to say that there would never be a subscription. Among fans, the lack of a subscription (outside of mapping features or LTE connectivity) has always been touted as a plus. Especially since Garmin watches are, on average, more expensive than the competition. It\u2019s hard to say how fans will react given that so much will remain free, but generally speaking, introducing subscriptions is a dicey proposition. Oura, for instance, experienced massive backlash when it introduced a subscription with its Gen 3 ring. Either way, Garmin has faced increased competition these past years. Both Apple and Samsung launched rugged outdoors smartwatches of their own, while Coros has emerged as another popular brand among athletes with long battery life and advanced GPS. At the same time, Garmin\u2019s wearables division isn\u2019t exactly suffering. It recently surpassed expectations for its Q4 earnings, reporting a large 31 percent increase in fitness tracker sales and its stock hitting record highs.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"\ufeffWhat happens when a deadly, pathogenic virus collides with Big Agriculture?  by  Nilay Patel \ufeffWhat happens when a deadly, pathogenic virus collides with Big Agriculture?  by  Nilay Patel On today\u2019s episode, we\u2019re talking about bird flu, but in a pretty Decoder way. Lauren Leffer, who recently wrote a piece for The Verge about bird flu and how it\u2019s becoming a forever war, joined me on the show, and we talked about the systems, structure, and culture that might control bird flu \u2014 and those that might make it worse.  You\u2019ve most likely heard about bird flu in the context of egg prices. Eggs are expensive and hard to find right now because the bird flu has kicked off an old fashioned supply and demand problem: the virus kills almost every single chicken it infects; fewer chickens means fewer eggs, and fewer eggs means higher prices. You\u2019ll hear Lauren say it\u2019s a little more complicated than that, but that\u2019s the basic shape of it. But the bird flu is actually quite a bit more serious than just the egg supply. The first confirmed human death linked to the virus happened in January. Now, we\u2019re facing some uncomfortable questions with no easy answers. Like how rapidly the new strains of bird flu, known collectively as H5N1, might be spreading from birds to dairy cows and other animals, as well as just how deadly those new strains are among both birds and mammals, including human beings.  If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re starting to feel some uncomfortably familiar feelings, and you\u2019re not wrong to feel them. There are some real echoes of COVID-19 here \u2014 and the Trump administration, with Robert Kennedy Jr. as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, is not at all equipped to handle a fast-moving pathogenic virus. Kennedy himself is an anti-vaccine activist who peddles junk science with abandon. Just last week, Kennedy went on Fox News and suggested one way to deal with ongoing bird flu outbreaks was to simply let it spread and kill all the birds, which is a purely stupid idea for a variety of reasons Lauren and discussed. Certainly not helping the matter is that on Thursday, just a few days after Lauren and I talked for this episode, Kennedy announced a major workforce reduction of HHS, with layoffs hitting 10,000 employees in a move Kennedy said would a \u201ca painful period\u201d for the department that would involve doing \u201cmore with less.\u201d If all that wasn\u2019t enough, the messy aftermath of the pandemic and the damage done to institutional trust across the board would make the job difficult for even a credible leader of our public health services. But like I said, I wanted to talk about this in a Decoder framework, and there\u2019s one big difference from COVID-19 that I wanted to push on here: industrial agriculture in the US is a big business, and the bird flu is a threat to that business. Millions of dead birds represent millions in lost revenue, and if the virus becomes more deadly to dairy cows, that\u2019s even more money on the line. So if the government isn\u2019t capable of mounting a response, is the industry capable of seeing and solving this problem before it becomes even worse? The answer, as you might expect, is a resounding question mark, but as Lauren explained, different parts of the market are reacting differently. And right now, there still appears to be time: scientists are not yet raising the kinds of alarms that we started to see in the months leading up to March 2020, when covid changed all of our lives forever. But one thing is very clear: the bird flu is not just going to go away, no matter how much Kennedy might wish that was how it worked. We need to learn how to live with it and manage it. And so long as we can get everyone on the same page, we might even be able to fight it.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"It's only for Prime members, but it's the best shot you've got right now. The new GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is officially here, and somehow it's still in stock at Amazon for $979.99. That may not be a discount, but considering how new-gen GPUs tend to vanish or double in price the moment scalpers get involved, this is a small miracle. We saw stock for the UK yesterday as well, as covered by our friends at Digital Foundry, but that went fast. $979.99 (MSRP) See here So if you're in the US, you're in luck today. You\u2019re getting a powerful 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM, built on NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell architecture, with PCIe 5.0 support and a WINDFORCE cooling system that actually keeps temps chill. It\u2019s factory overclocked, too, so you\u2019re squeezing extra frames out of it right out of the box. So yeah, no fire sale here. But if you\u2019re already running a solid rig and just need a GPU refresh, this card delivers serious horsepower without jumping through eBay hoops. Note, you'll need a Prime membership to access this one, but you can secure a free trial via Amazon to cover you this time. But if your current setup is a few years old, swapping in a GPU alone might not cut it. Power supplies, cooling, CPU bottlenecks all add up fast. Sometimes, grabbing a full prebuilt system just makes more sense. You get fresh, fully optimized hardware without the hassle. Some builders like Maingear even hand-tune BIOS settings and deliver systems without any of that annoying bloatware. It\u2019s like buying peace of mind and frames per second at the same time. $3,192 \u2013 Hand-built, zero bloatware See here If you\u2019re after a no-compromise, maxed-out rig built by pros, the Maingear Rush Mk. IV is your ticket. It packs the powerful Ryzen 9 9950X and RTX 5070 Ti combo with 32GB of DDR5 memory and a 360mm AIO cooler to keep thermals under control. Best of all, it\u2019s hand-assembled, bloatware-free, and BIOS-optimized out of the box for peak performance. A serious machine for serious gamers. $1,799.99 (Was $1,949.99) See here For gamers who want top-tier 1440p or entry 4K gaming without breaking the bank, the Skytech King 95 with the i7-14700F and RTX 5070 nails the sweet spot (I thought i'd give you a cheaper option too). You still get a 360mm liquid cooler, ultra-fast Gen4 SSD, and 32GB of DDR5 RAM. It\u2019s sleek, powerful, and ready to tackle any modern title you throw at it. $2,376 (Was $2,499.99) See here This variant of the King 95 pairs AMD\u2019s Ryzen 7 7800X3D with the RTX 5070 Ti, making it a beast for gaming and streaming alike.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Business Insider Edition  After several false starts, Trump's auto tariffs are finally here \u2014 and they could make buying a new car a lot more expensive.          The announcement of the 25% tariffs on all imported passenger vehicles and key car parts, which take effect on April 2, sent foreign and domestic auto stocks tumbling.               Analysts have long warned that the levies are likely to push up car prices as the US automotive industry scrambles to respond.               Wedbush analysts said in a Wednesday note that the tariffs \"would be a hurricane-like headwind to foreign (and many US) automakers and ultimately push the average price of cars up $5k to $10k depending on the make\/ model\/price point.\"               Analysis from Anderson Economic Group puts the potential price hike from Trump's levies between $4,000 and $12,000 depending on the vehicle. EVs are likely to be hit hard because they use imported batteries and electronics.               Cox Automotive, meanwhile, estimated that the tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which go into effect on April 2, would raise the price of US-made vehicles by more than $3,000. That's on top of an estimated $300 to $500 price increase because of previously announced tariffs on steel and aluminum and a 20% levy on all Chinese imports.               Automakers are also sounding the alarm. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents major US automakers, including GM and Ford, warned earlier this month that proposed import taxes could raise\u00a0car prices by as much as 25%.               GM and Ford, as well as foreign rivals such as Toyota, Nissan, and BMW, all have major production facilities in Mexico, meaning they're also likely to be negatively affected by the tariffs.               Barclays analysts warned earlier this month that 25% levies on auto imports from Mexico and Canada could effectively wipe out profits for Ford, GM, and Stellantis.               Automakers such as Tesla, which build most of their cars in the US, will\u00a0feel the pain, too, with the tariffs extending to automobile parts, including engines, powertrain parts, and \"electrical components.\"               Despite building their cars in the US, Tesla and others still source many of their components abroad. Between 20% and 25% of the components from Tesla's 2025 vehicles come from Mexico, according to regulatory filings.               Shares in foreign automakers fell following the announcement of the tariffs, with Nissan, Toyota, and Honda down between 1.5% to 3.5%.               In Europe, BMW and Volkswagen fell slightly in morning trading, while Mercedes stock dipped 2%.               Economists have warned that increasing the tariff of cars imported from Europe to the US to 25% from the current 2.5% would lead to a sharp drop in the number of cars shipped across the Atlantic.               A January report from Oxford Economics estimated that automotive exports from Germany and Italy would decline by 7.1% and 6.6%, respectively, because of the tariffs. The US is the main non-EU export market for both countries.               Germany's struggling auto industry would be hit particularly hard, with Oxford Economics estimating that total automotive production would decline by about 5.3%.               That's not a scenario manufacturers including VW \u2014 already grappling with excess capacity and mulling factory closures to cut costs \u2014\u00a0want to see.               In the past, US tariffs on vehicles built in China have led to European automakers delaying the launch of new models in the US \u2014 and in the case of Chinese automakers like BYD, avoiding America entirely.               The Trump administration's latest trade war escalation also raises the prospect that Europe, Japan, and South Korea may retaliate with their own tariffs on US car exports.               After Trump revealed the 25% auto tariffs, Japan's prime minister vowed that \"every option\" was on the table as the country considered its response.               Germany's economy minister, meanwhile, called on the EU to deliver a \"decisive response\" to the tariffs, while South Korea said it would announce emergency measures next month.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"The world has changed, said the chancellor - and hours later it did, again. It is a phrase that has become a familiar one at Westminster in the last few days and the line used to justify the shift in priorities and spending cuts Rachel Reeves announced in her Spring Statement. When folk in government say the world has changed what they mean, at least in part, is Donald Trump is back in the White House and they can't be remotely certain what is going to happen next. In the latest example of stagecraft and statecraft amounting to the same thing for America's president, he set out in a news conference that Washington would be imposing an import tax or tariff of 25% on all cars America buys from abroad. For the UK, the US is the second largest car export market after the EU, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Two and a bit months in to Trump's second term, the strategy from the government in the UK has been to wrangle in private and say as little as possible in public. \"If in doubt, say nowt\" is how you might colloquially describe the approach, resisting the temptation to be drawn into commentary about the president's actions for fear of provoking a blast of his ire. And alongside this, work has been under way to agree a US-UK trade deal, which may provide some insulation from the whims and broadsides of Trump. But all this underlines that uncertainty is the new certainty and considerable bandwidth is absorbed within government anticipating what might be around the corner and then seeking to negotiate about and\/or mitigate the consequences of whatever is expected to change. The independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), tasked with the near impossible job of economic projections amid such swirling uncertainty, nonetheless has a go. With more than a splash of understatement, the OBR writes in its latest economic and fiscal outlook - which accompanied the chancellor's Spring Statement - that \"following the election of a new US administration in November, US trade policies and those of its major trading partners remain in flux\". You can say that again. Across five pages, the OBR works through various scenarios following a hike in tariffs of 20 percentage points by the US. Firstly on countries other than the UK, then on all countries including the UK and finally again on all countries including the UK but where those countries reciprocate with equivalent tariffs on US goods. Flick to page 40 here to have a read for yourself.  The most severe, involving retaliation, the forecaster reckons, \"would almost entirely eliminate the headroom against the fiscal mandate\" \u2013 in other words, near nuke on its own all the budgetary shuffling and trade-offs Reeves has been juggling with in recent weeks. Blimey. For this reason among many ministers will be desperate to avoid anything close to this scenario playing out. And all of this just days before what Trump has dubbed \"Liberation Day\" next Tuesday, when, yes, a huge number of new tariffs are anticipated. The chancellor has told the BBC that there are \"intense negotiations with US counterparts\" including \"on cars, steel and every other kind of tariff\".  There are \"a few more days left of those negotiations\", Reeves said, adding: \"We don't want to get into a trade war\". The world has changed, and continues to change. Sign up for our Politics Essential newsletter to keep up with the inner workings of Westminster and beyond. Starmer says he will take a \"cool-headed\" approach on tariffs but all options remain on the table.  Sarah Boardman says she is facing a backlash over her work and is concerned for her business.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Germany has said it \"will not give in\" and that Europe must \"respond firmly\" as US President Donald Trump targets imported cars and car parts with a 25% tax in his latest tariffs. Other major world economies have vowed to retaliate, with France's president branding the move \"a waste of time\" and \"incoherent\", Canada calling it a \"direct attack\", and China accusing Washington of violating international trade rules. Carmaker stocks from Japan to Germany dipped. In the US, General Motors dropped 7%, while Ford fell more than 2%.  Trump has threatened to impose \"far larger\" tariffs if Europe works with Canada to do what he describes as \"economic harm\" to the US. The fresh car tariffs will come into effect on 2 April, with charges on businesses importing vehicles starting the next day. Taxes on parts are set to start in May or later. Trump has long maintained the tariffs are part of a drive to help US manufacturing and says if cars are made in America there will be \"absolutely no tariff\". Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries. While the measures can protect domestic businesses, they also raise costs for companies reliant on parts from abroad. The firms that bring the foreign goods into the country pay the tax to the government. Firms may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers. The US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade and roughly half of overall sales. Mexico is the top supplier of cars to the US, followed by South Korea, Japan, Canada and Germany. Analysts have estimated that tariffs on parts just from Canada and Mexico could lead to costs rising by $4,000-$10,000 depending on the vehicle, according to the Anderson Economic Group. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said the European Union must \"respond firmly\". \"It must be clear that we will not give in to the US. We need to show strength and self-confidence,\" he added. France backed this joint approach, with its finance minister saying Europe must retaliate with tariffs on US products. At a press conference on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron said it was \"not the time\" for the US to be imposing tariffs. \"Imposing tariffs means breaking value chains, it means creating in the short term an inflationary effect and destroying jobs,\" he said in Paris.  \"All of this is rather a waste of time and will create a lot of worry,\" he added, urging Trump to reconsider.  Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney called the tariffs a \"direct attack\" on his country and its car industry, adding it \"will hurt us\", but trade options were being discussed. In the UK, car industry body the SMMT said the car tariffs announcement was \"not surprising but, nevertheless, disappointing\". Uniparts founder John Neill said the Trump tariffs were \"a gift to the Chinese\", because international consumers would respond to a trade war by buying Chinese alternatives. Meanwhile, China accused Trump of violating World Trade Organization rules. \"There are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war. No country's development and prosperity has been achieved by imposing tariffs,\" a spokesman for the foreign ministry said. There are warnings from Japan that there will be a \"significant impact\" on the economic relationship it shares with the US. A government spokesman described the measures as \"extremely regrettable\" and said officials had asked the US for an exemption. In South Korea, a day before the latest levy, Hyundai announced it would invest $21bn (\u00a316.3bn) in the US and build a new steel plant in Louisiana. Trump hailed the investment as a \"clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work\". Bosch - based in Germany - said it had confidence in the \"long-term potential\" of the North American market and would continue to expand its business there. The International Monetary Fund said it was not projecting a US recession, but warned a trade war could have a \"significant adverse effect\" on Canada and Mexico's economic outlooks.  Critically endangered Galapagos tortoises Abrazzo and Mommy are parents of four hatchlings at Philadelphia Zoo High winds and heavy rain were expected to continue into Sunday, delaying clean-up efforts.

Streaming services are the default choice for watching movies these days, since it can make picking and watching a movie much faster. However, owning physical copies of your favorite movies and shows still has its advantages, especially if you value quality and longevity. If you have a 4K TV, you'll want content that takes advantage of that resolution, and not all streaming platforms deliver that. Plus, most of the time quality is compressed, so you aren't really getting the experience you deserve. That's where 4K Blu-rays come in, delivering the best picture and sound quality available for you to keep. Amazon's Big Spring Sale event ends today. That means this is your last chance to score a ton of 4K Blu-rays for $13 or less on Amazon. There are dozens of titles on sale right now, so you're bound to find something you'll love. And with these super low prices, it's a great time to stock up on your favorites if you don't already have them. Since these 4K Blu-rays are physical discs that you'll buy, you also won't have to worry about no longer being able to access them at some point in the future, unless your Blu-ray player (like a PlayStation 5) breaks down.

These are just a few of the dozens of 4K and Blu-ray titles that you can find on Amazon right now for the Big Spring Sale. Make sure to peruse the full list to find anything that may suit your fancy. Keep in mind there are also a lot of DVDs thrown into the mix, so be sure to check that it's the format you want first. Though streaming has exploded in popularity, it seems we now have too many streaming services and it's harder to find the content you want to watch on the services you subscribe to. Not everyone wants to subscribe to every single streaming service (it's just cable all over again), and it's a pain when the content you want is no longer available on a particular service.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Business Insider Edition  When Silicon Valley became the center of the computing industry in the 1970s, a regional economy worth trillions of dollars cropped up in the San Francisco Bay Area. Now, as the era of quantum computing gains momentum, five cities across the country are poised to become the next tech hot spot.          Quantum computing is a burgeoning field that leverages quantum mechanics to solve complex problems faster than is possible using classical computers.               With researchers optimistic that breakthroughs in the field could revolutionize medicine, data privacy, and more, quantum hardware manufacturing and software development has attracted major investments from tech giants including IBM, Google, and Microsoft, as well as smaller players like D-Wave, IonQ, and Rigetti \u2014\u00a0and the economic stakes for becoming a hub for the new tech are major.               The quantum industry attracted $1.2 billion from venture capitalists in 2023 despite a 50% drop in overall tech investments that year, according to research by Boston Consulting Group. A recent report from the market intelligence firm Resonance projected the global quantum computing market could add more than $1 trillion to the global economy over the next 10 years.               The tech sector is known for driving massive economic growth. The regional think tank Joint Venture Silicon Valley recently reported the Bay Area achieved an unprecedented market cap of $14.3 trillion in 2024, with an unemployment rate more than a full percent lower than the rest of the state.               \"That is for real \u2014\u00a0when people centralize in a place, and those people also have other needs serviced by the local economy, it creates growth across not one sector, but in many sectors, and it creates a shared prosperity.\" Russell Hancock, the president and chief executive of Joint Venture Silicon Valley told Business Insider.               Hancock said the economy that grew around Silicon Valley did so in part because of its proximity to major research institutions like Stanford and UC Berkeley that spurred innovation, in addition to its real estate market \u2014\u00a0which at the time was startup-friendly.               \"I think it's valid to think of Silicon Valley not just as a place but to think of it as a phenomenon,\" Hancock said. \"The phenomenon is composed of a massive focus on technology, accompanied by innovation and entrepreneurship and risk-taking.\"               Silicon Valley just isn't the exclusive location where that phenomenon is happening these days \u2014\u00a0especially for the quantum industry. Here are five locations where the conditions are right to build Qubit County, the new quantum capital of the nation.               The coastal city of Santa Barbara is already home to Google's Quantum AI Campus in addition to Microsoft's Station Q research headquarters, which is located on the campus of UC Santa Barbara.               UC Santa Barbara is also home to a next-generation foundry that develops the materials and interfaces needed to power quantum-based electronics.               Santa Barbara is located less than two hours north of Los Angeles, where UCLA researchers are focused on quantum science developments. In 2024, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he'd awarded UCLA $200 million in state funds to transform the former Westside Pavilion Mall into a research facility that will house the California Institute for Immunology and Immunotherapy and the UCLA Center for Quantum Science and Engineering.               Chicago is home to the Chicago Quantum Exchange based at the University of Chicago, one of the world's largest collaborative teams working on quantum science through partnerships with more than 50 corporate, international, and nonprofit organizations.               The city is also the site of the forthcoming multibillion-dollar public-private partnership known as the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park, which will include shared cryogenic facilities, equipment labs, and research spaces to further advance quantum technology.               IQMP is projected to generate $20 billion in economic impact and create thousands of jobs, according to a press release about the project. The state of Illinois is investing $500 million in its development.               \"Gov. Pritzker of Illinois has been extremely active on this front,\" Rigetti CEO Subodh Kulkarni told Business Insider, describing the city of Chicago as one of the \"potential centers\" of quantum tech for the country, if not the world.               At GTC this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang announced his company's plans to build a quantum research lab in Boston to partner with researchers from MIT and Harvard.               \"It will likely be the most advanced accelerated hybrid quantum computing research lab world,\" Huang said.               Boston is already home to QuEra Computing, a startup building quantum computers based on neutral atoms. Last year, The Boston Globe reported the state's spending bill earmarked $40 million to build a \"quantum innovation hub\" in the Pioneer Valley, about two hours West of Boston.               \"I think that the Boston area has a very interesting collection of companies and educational institutions that could end up being a very important location for the industry,\" Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave told Business Insider.               Margaret Arakawa, IonQ's Chief Marketing Officer, told Business Insider that her company, headquartered in Maryland, believes the state will become \"the capital of quantum\" by building a partnership with the University of Maryland the way Silicon Valley entrepreneurs partnered with Standford and UC Berkeley academics.               \"We want to work with companies and universities that are building out not just research, but actual implementation and building of the quantum computers and the networks,\" Arakawa said. \"So we look at the University of Maryland, and all of the government officials, academia, the businesses, the association of physicists, and we think Maryland is actually chock full of all the right elements to create the capital of quantum.\"               UMD, based in College Park, is a hub for quantum research and development and home to the Quantum Startup Foundry, an accelerator that supports entrepreneurs and startups in bringing quantum technologies to market.               In January, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore announced the \"Capital of Quantum\" Initiative \u2014 a $1 billion public-private partnership to \"cement Maryland as a global leader in quantum information science and technology.\"               Three of Colorado's most prominent universities \u2014 the University of Colorado Boulder, Colorado State University, and the Colorado School of Mines \u2014 earlier this year partnered with the Elevate Quantum Tech Hub to launch a 13,000-square-foot quantum incubator in Boulder.               The Department of Commerce in 2023 designated Elevate Quantum as one of only two tech hubs in the country focused on advancing quantum technologies, per a press release from Sen. Michael Bennet. The tech hub has also been awarded $40.5 million in federal funding to support the development of a leading quantum ecosystem.               The Boulder Quantum Incubator builds on momentum from a 2024 bill passed in the state to encourage economic growth in the quantum sector. According to a Quantum Insider report, the law is projected to create over 10,000 quantum-related jobs in the state within the next decade.               Matthew Kinsella, CEO of the quantum technology company Infleqtion, told Business Insider that the development of a nationwide quantum capital will likely depend on state and local government supporting the creation of a local ecosystem to propel the tech forward.               \"And I think places like Colorado and Chicago are pretty high on that list,\" Kinsella said.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement      Nearly every team offers an in-market streaming service this season, making it easier for fans to watch their favorite team. Here's what you need to know.    Like starting pitchers who throw 200 innings or more in a season, blackout restrictions in baseball are dwindling and may soon be a thing of the past. In this era of bullpens filled with flame-throwing relievers and analytics that show a pitcher facing a lineup for a third time in a game usually yields poor results, only four pitchers hit the 200-innings mark last year, down from 34 only a decade prior. And in this era of streaming, only four teams still have blackout restrictions in place that prevent their fans from streaming their games from anywhere without needing a pay-TV subscription. For most baseball fans this season, you can subscribe to a direct-to-consumer streaming package for roughly $20 a month that will show nearly every one of your team's games, whether you live in your team's market or are an out-of-market fan. And the odds are good that your local team's games are still available on a regional sports network, a TV channel you can get with cable or satellite TV or a live TV streaming service. With more DTC options for more MLB fans, it's getting easier to follow your favorite team. Keep reading to find out the best way to watch or stream baseball in 2025 no matter where you live or which team you follow. Shohei Ohtani and the Los Angeles Dodgers are favorites to repeat as World Series champions in 2025. For out-of-market fans, the best way to watch your team's games is the same as it's been for years: Major League Baseball's official streaming service. MLB.TV shows almost every game of every team for the entire regular season. MLB.TV costs $150 for the season or $30 per month for a package that includes every out-of-market team. Or you can buy a single-team subscription for $130 for the season. The catch is that your local team's games are blacked out and only available 90 minutes after the game ends.\u00a0 MLB.TV subscribers also miss games that are broadcast nationally on ESPN, Fox, FS1, MLB Network and TBS as well as those that air on streaming services like Apple TV Plus and Max. These games are also blacked out on MLB.TV, which can be particularly irksome for fans of the Yankees, Red Sox, Dodgers and other big-market teams that are frequently selected for national broadcasts. MLB.TV costs $150 for the season. If you're unsure if your team will be in the pennant race come August, you can take it month by month and pay $30 per month. Those who care only about watching one team can buy a single-team option for a one-time $130 fee. As a subscriber, you can watch out-of-market games live or on demand, and the in-market (home) team with a 90-minute delay from the end of the game. With MLB.TV, you can also listen to home and away radio broadcasts. The radio broadcasts aren't subject to the blackout rule, so you can listen to home team games live. MLB.TV also features MLB Network and a ton of video content including classic games, baseball documentaries and old This Week in Baseball episodes. Even if you don't subscribe, you can still watch baseball with the MLB app. It offers one Game of the Day that anyone can stream live for free. Read our MLB.TV review.    For the first time last year, Major League Baseball offered an in-market analog of MLB.TV for three teams: the Arizona Diamondbacks, Colorado Rockies and San Diego Padres. Now, that number has increased to 10 teams with in-market streaming options available directly from MLB. These plans cost between $20 and $30 a month. The service will let in-market fans watch most but not every game of the season, because games that are nationally broadcast on ESPN, Fox, FS1, MLB Network, TBS or Apple TV Plus will be blacked out on the service. It's the same situation out-of-market fans run into with MLB.TV.\u00a0 You can also combine one of these in-market streaming services and out-of-market MLB.TV to get access to nearly every non-national game of the season, with national broadcasts still blacked out. Pricing varies slightly by team, but the combined package generally costs around $40 per month or $200 for the season. In addition to the above 10 teams, there are 16 teams that offer a DTC package from their broadcast partner. Nine of these teams previously broadcast their games on the defunct Bally Sports RSN, now called FanDuel Sports Network. It offers a DTC option for these nine teams for $20 per month or $100 for the season. You can subscribe directly from FanDuel or add it to a Prime Video subscription. These FanDuel Sports Network RSN channels are also available on Fubo and DirecTV Stream. For both the DTC option or the RSN channel, you need to live in the team's local market to access it. The other seven teams offer a DTC streaming option from its broadcast partner, again in a team's local area only. So, who's missing? The four teams without a DTC package are the Baltimore Orioles and Washington Nationals on MASN, the Houston Astros on Space City Home Network and the Seattle Mariners on Root Sports Northwest. For each of these teams, in-market fans will need a pay-TV subscription that includes its RSN.\u00a0 Among the five major live TV streaming services, both Fubo and DirecTV Stream offer each of these RSNs in each team's local market. And keep in mind that in addition to an RSN, Fubo and DirecTV Stream carry most if not all of the major national TV networks -- ESPN, Fox, FS1, MLB Network and TBS -- that regularly televise matchups from different teams around the league. Fubo's $95-a-month Elite package includes RSNs for your local team's games along with ESPN, Fox, FS1 and MLB Network for national broadcasts. It lacks TBS and TruTV, however, for Tuesday night games. You can use its channel lookup tool to see which local channels and RSNs are available where you live. Read our Fubo review.    DirecTV Stream's Choice plan costs $109 a month when you factor in RSN fees and includes the most RSN channels for baseball. It carries every local RSN for every team except those for the Blue Jays and Phillies. It also includes ESPN, TBS, Fox, FS1 and MLB Network for national broadcasts. Check out which local networks and RSNs it offers. Read our DirecTV Stream review.    Each live TV streaming service offers a free trial, allows you to cancel anytime and requires a solid internet connection. Looking for more information? Check out our\u00a0live TV streaming services guide. A handful of streaming services have deals with MLB to carry select games exclusively this season. Most of these require a separate streaming service, which can be annoying if your favorite team is on a national broadcast and you aren't already a subscriber to the service that's streaming it. The one exception is the Saturday games on Fox and FS1, which require a pay-TV service in order to watch, on either TV channel itself, but also to authenticate to stream on the Fox Sports app. Apple TV Plus costs $10 a month and, like last year, will stream a baseball doubleheader every Friday night this season. Apple's MLB games will be free from blackout restrictions, so you'll be able to watch them no matter where you live and which teams are playing. The games are exclusive to Apple TV Plus, however, which means you won't find them on your local RSN if your local team is playing. A full schedule of Apple's MLB broadcasts through the end of June\u00a0can be found here.\u00a0 Read our Apple TV Plus review.    Roku returns for its second year of Sunday baseball streaming. It will show 18 games on Sundays from mid-May to early September. Dubbed MLB Sunday Leadoff, Ruku's baseball package will show one of the first games on Sundays, with some starting as early as 11:35 a.m. ET. This free channel is available on Roku TVs and devices, a mobile app for iOS and Android, as well as on smart TVs and streaming devices running software from Samsung, Google (Google TV or Android TV) or Amazon (Fire TV).\u00a0 The Max streaming service will show the TBS or TruTV broadcasts on Tuesday nights this season. The Basic with ads plan for Max costs $10 a month but starting March 30, you'll need the ad-free Standard plan that costs $17 a month to watch live sports, including MLB games. Read our Max review.    ESPN and MLB are parting ways after this season. Unless they strike a new deal, the 2025 campaign will be the 36th and final season of Sunday Night Baseball on ESPN. It will also mark the end of the daily MLB game available on ESPN's stand-alone streaming service. ESPN Plus costs $12 a month or $120 a year and streams one game nearly every day of the six-month MLB season. The catch is that your local team's games are blacked out when they appear on ESPN Plus, similar to MLB.TV. Also, the games shown on ESPN Plus aren't exclusive to ESPN Plus and are also available on MLB.TV. Read our ESPN Plus review.    An MLB.TV subscription includes the ability to stream what's on MLB Network, from its studio shows to live games. Most baseball fans want to be able to watch their favorite team night in and night out during the regular season, but for the more casual baseball viewer, there's a standalone subscription for MLB Network.\u00a0 It costs $7 a month or $70 a year, which is about half of what an MLB.TV subscription costs. That's a lot considering that blackout restrictions apply here, too, so you can watch only out-of-market games on MLB Network.\u00a0 It does include the audio feed of every game, if you like to listen to radio broadcasts of baseball games. If that describes you, then you should check out an\u00a0At Bat subscription. It costs $4 a month or $30 a year and lets you listen to the home or away radio broadcasts and watch one game per day during the season. You can't choose which game you want to watch; you're stuck with the MLB.TV Free Game of the Day. For Yankees fans in the team's market, Amazon (which owns a piece of the YES Network) will once again stream 21 Yankees games on Prime Video this season, mostly on Wednesday nights. You'll need to be a Prime member too (currently $139 per year).\u00a0 These games are exclusive to Prime Video and won't be viewable without a Prime Video account even if you pay for cable TV or the YES app. A full list of games can be found here, with the first exclusive contest set for April 2 when the Yankees host the Diamondbacks.","label":0}

The good news helped temper the impact of Trump\u2019s announcement of 25% tariffs on cars, trucks and auto parts \u2014 which sent General Motors (GM) and some peers down. The S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average fluctuated after fourth-quarter GDP growth was revised up 2.4% annually from 2.3%, reflecting higher investment and a downward revision to import growth. New filings for jobless benefits remained steady in the week to March 22, as did continuing claims for the priror week. \u201cHard to see recession in these data, but the real test will be the initial read on Q1 2025 GDP, when the trade shocks feed into the numbers \u2014 that may not look so rosy,\u201d Jamie Cox, managing partner for Harris Financial Group, said in an email. \u201cThe labor market is far stronger and resilient than folks appreciate.\u201d Automakers weren\u2019t a big beneficiary of the batter data, as they face higher costs under Trump\u2019s tariffs that they\u2019ll either have to absorb or pass on to customers.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"By\u00a0         The Associated Press                        Phan Cong Quang makes fish sauce in his home in Nam O fishing village on March 4.                                                           Yannick Peterhans\/AP                                       hide caption  DA NANG, Vietnam \u2014 Bui Van Phong faced a choice when the Vietnam War ended 50 years ago: Stay in his small village, helping his parents carry on the family's centuries-old tradition of making fish sauce, or join the hundreds of thousands of people fleeing his country for a better life. Phong chose to stay behind and nurtured a business making the beloved condiment, known as nuoc mam in Vietnam, that is now in its fourth generation with his son, Bui Van Phu, 41, at the helm. Fish sauce from the village has been recognized by Vietnam as an indelible part of the country's heritage and the younger Bui is acutely aware of what that means. \"It isn't just the quality of fish sauce. It is also the historical value,\" he said. But that heritage is under threat, and not only from giant conglomerates that mass-produce fish sauce in factories. Climate change and overfishing are making it harder to catch the anchovies essential to the condiment that underlies so much of Vietnam and southeast Asia's food. Anchovies thrive in large schools in nutrient-rich waters near the shore. But climate change is warming the oceans, depleting oxygen levels in the water. Scientists have long feared that this would lead to smaller fish, as large fish that need more oxygen may migrate or adapt over time by shrinking. Renato Salvatteci, who studies fisheries at the Christian-Albrecht University of Kiel in Germany, said his research into warmer periods millenia ago found support for this in the fossil record. \"If we continue with this trend of deoxygenation, anchovies will not be OK with that,\" he said. \"Every species has a limit.\" Breaching that limit will have global consequences. Warming oceans threaten the ocean ecology and the marine life that inhabits it. It may result in the proliferation of smaller, less nutritious fish and increase costs of fishing and consequently food. Anchovies, for instance, have an outsized role on marine ecology. They're food for other fish that people eat, like mackerel. They are also vital to make fish meal, used to feed farmed fish. Overfishing compounds the problem, and geopolitical tensions in the contested waters of the South China Sea \u2014 responsible for about 12% of the global fish catch \u2014 make management difficult. The destructive industrial fishing practice of dragging large nets along the seabed, scooping up everything in a net's path, has prevailed since the 1980s. But despite increased fishing, the amount of fish being caught has stagnated, according to a 2020 analysis of fishing trends. Even if the world can limit long-term global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels and halve fishing intensity, the South China Sea will still lose more than a fifth of its fish stocks, warned a 2021 assessment by scientists from the University of British Columbia in Canada. In the most pessimistic scenario \u2014 temperatures rising by 7.7 degrees Fahrenheit (4.3 degrees) \u2014 nearly all the fish disappear. Phu, who teaches information technology by day, also works hard to perfect the fish sauce art handed down by his ancestors. The anchovies are usually caught between January to March when they congregate off the coast of Da Nang. If they are the right species and size, they get mixed gently with sea salt and put in special tera cotta barrels. Sometimes worms or other ingredients are added to bring in different flavors. Phu ferments this for up to 18 months \u2014 stirring the mix several times a week \u2014 before it can be strained, bottled and sold to customers. The sea salt imparts different flavor depending on where it comes from. So does the amount of salt used, and makers have their own recipes; the Bui family uses three parts fish to one part salt. The time allowed for fermentation, and the potential addition of other fish, also affect the flavor of the final product. But it is harder to get the perfect anchovies. The fish catch has decreased \u2014 fishermen in markets across Vietnam rue the fact that much of the fish they sell now was considered bait-size in previous decades \u2014 and it's only the good relationships he has with anchovy fishermen that allow him to get the fish directly, avoiding high market prices. The unmistakeable aroma of fermenting fish cloaks the homes of families that still make traditional fish sauce. But Phu said that many families are thinking of getting out of the business because of high anchovy prices. That may affect Vietnamese plans for a bigger share of the global fish sauce market \u2014 projected to increase in value from $18.5 billion in 2023 to nearly $29 billion by 2032, according to a report by Introspective Market Research. Vietnam, along with Thailand, is the world's largest exporter of fish sauce and is hoping improvements in food safety to satisfy standards in lucrative markets like the U.S., Europe and Japan will help cement a national brand that helps advertise Vietnamese culture to the world. It's hard to overemphasize how deeply the condiment is enmeshed in Vietnamese culture. Students living abroad speak of how its taste transports them back home and a top chef says it's the foundation for flavor in the country's cuisine. The varying taste of different brews also means everyone \u2014 from top businessmen to daily wage workers \u2014 has their own opinions about which is the best. Phu said that each family has their own secrets about making fish sauce. And, nearly fifty years since his father chose to stay back and take care of the family business, he'd like to pass those on to his own son. But he knows that it'll depend on whether enough anchovies thrive in the sea for the craft to be viable. \"Fish sauce to me is not just a condiment for cooking. But it is our craft, our culture, our tradition that need to be preserved, safeguarded and inherited,\" he said. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Business Insider Edition  Used Tesla listings jumped by 33% so far this year with at least one industry expert saying CEO Elon Musk's antics continue to have an \"undeniable\" impact on the brand.          Citing Autotrader data, analysts for Cox Automotive said Wednesday that Tesla listings jumped from around 8,500 at the beginning of 2025 to 11,515 on March 16. Still, the company saw increases in all other EV listings during the same period at 27% year-to-date, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox Automotive's director of industry insights, in an industry forecast.               Tesla's share of used EV listings only moved by one point to 40% this year, suggesting that the rise of Tesla listings could be due to greater product availability, she said.               \"It's undeniable that Elon Musk is an influential factor whose actions are impacting the brand's image and sales, and only time will tell if Tesla can successfully navigate this critical juncture and find a new engine for growth,\" Streaty said.               Teslas and showrooms across the US have been the subjects of attacks and vandalism in recent months following Musk's association with the White House DOGE office. This week, the FBI created a task force to investigate and crack down on what it called \"acts of violence, vandalism, and domestic terrorism.\"               Still, Tesla owners looking to offload their EVs might not get as much back for the car as they paid for it. Used Tesla prices have been in a freefall for the past few years, with the average price of a used Tesla now $10,000 less than that of a non-Tesla electric car, according to data from the dealership website CarGurus.               Streaty said Tesla has faced \"significant challenges\" since propelling the EV market into the mainstream in 2020. Several factors, including increased competition, an aging product lineup, economic factors affecting consumers, and controversies surrounding Elon Musk, have caused the company to experience declining sales in the US.               \"We believe, without a significant change in strategy to develop new products with widespread appeal, Tesla's high watermark as an automaker may be in the past,\" she said.               One former Tesla owner, Scott Oran, a real estate developer who lives near Boston, previously told BI he decided to sell his Model 3 after Musk's political moves left him \"embarrassed\" to be seen driving it.               \"I think, unfortunately, through Elon Musk's actions, he's probably irrevocably damaged the Tesla brand,\" Oran said.               Tesla did not immediately return a request for comment from Business Insider on Thursday.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"ByWilliam Pesek  ByWilliam Pesek,  Senior Contributor.  getty There\u2019s a whiff of 1998 in the Jakarta air as investors flee Indonesia\u2019s currency and the stock market. The outflows are nowhere near those that toppled then-dictator Suharto. His downfall came amid the chaos of the Asian financial crisis. Massive street protests forced the military officer-turned-president to resign in May 1998. Yet many voters who elected Suharto\u2019s ex-son-in-law Prabowo Subianto in 2024 are suffering some serious buyer's remorse. Prabowo also was a military man \u2014 an ex-general. And sadly, his stewardship over Southeast Asia\u2019s economy prioritizes control over reforms to increase competitiveness. Prabowo\u2019s plan to water down the central bank\u2019s independence and populist spending policies suggests he understands little about the forces behind Indonesia\u2019s 1997-1998 crash. His strong-arm tactics toward international companies like Apple suggest Prabowo doesn\u2019t know he operates in the most dynamic economic region anywhere \u2014 and that foreign CEOs have many other options. You\u2019d think the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) debacle might have Prabowo thinking twice about transferring ownership of top state-owned enterprises to a new sovereign wealth fund \u2014 one that reports directly to him. The same goes for expanding the role of the military, reversing post-Suharto efforts to reduce the economic role of generals. None of these steps will better position Indonesia to withstand President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war. They won\u2019t revive flagging demand from China for raw materials. They will do little to achieve Prabowo\u2019s big election pledge to hasten growth to the 8% pace from today\u2019s 5%. The sense Prabowo is fighting the wrong battles has the rupiah falling to the weakest since the Asian financial crisis. And the central bank scrambling to put a floor under the currency via formal intervention. \u201cWe expect investor sentiment in Indonesian risk assets could remain weak in the near-term, and caution that Indonesian corporate dollar bonds could see more volatility ahead from negative headlines and overarching macro concerns,\u201d says CreditSights analyst Lakshmanan R. Already, global funds have dumped a net $2 billion of Indonesian equities this year. And it\u2019s no wonder why as Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 and those to come \u2014 threaten to generate unprecedented headwinds at the worst possible moment from the global financial system. Even worse is the bull market in uncertainty emanating from Washington. Officials in Jakarta, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Manila and elsewhere not knowing the scale, timing or ambitions of Trump\u2019s trade taxes makes it impossible for fiscal policymakers and central banks to strategize. In Indonesia\u2019s case, it\u2019s the pre-existing conditions that matter most. From 2014 to 2024, Prabowo\u2019s predecessor Joko Widodo put some key reforms on the scoreboard. Along with presiding over rapid economic growth and transformational infrastructure projects, Widodo achieved more than predecessors to eradicate extreme poverty in the nation of 281 million people. Under Widodo, Indonesia weathered the Covid-19 crisis better than many peers. Yet critics claim that Widodo went too easy on dynastic politics, old-time patronage and changing laws to benefit his family. And, of course, he opened the door to an unpredictable successor hailing from the armed forces. That successor is no longer enjoying the benefit of the doubt from global investors. At the end of 2024, overseas funds were teeing off Prabowo\u2019s pledges to turbocharge economic growth and attract increased investment. Now concerns about Indonesia\u2019s fiscal outlook and potential democratic backsliding have capital exiting rupiah-denominated assets. The benchmark Jakarta Composite Index is down nearly 20% across Prabowo\u2019s first five months in power, while the rupiah tests 26-year lows. Indonesia recently resorted to a foreign exchange \u201cretention\u201d plan requiring natural resource exporters to deposit 100% of currency earnings into a special account at national banks for 12 months. Such bids to support currency stability and contain market volatility are rarely a sign of confidence. Analysts at Fitch Ratings observe that \u201cIndonesia's external liquidity \u2014 measured by the ratio of liquid external assets to liquid external liabilities \u2014 remains weaker than many 'BBB' peers.\u201d Investors might have greater confidence in Prabowo\u2019s reform chances if he spent more time cutting red tape, creating jobs for Indonesia\u2019s young population and moving the economy upmarket into high-value-added industries than tightening his grip on the economy. Reports that Bank Indonesia will buy up state bonds through the secondary market has investors worried about the central bank funding public spending. This so-called \u201cdebt monetization\u201d rarely ends well for developing nations. Hence the whiff of 1998-like turbulence setting back the clock on a nation that deserves better from its leaders.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"British Steel is launching a consultation that could result in the closure of Scunthorpe's two blast furnaces, putting up to 2,700 jobs out of a total of 3,500 at risk. BBC News sought reaction from the town. Children from a Scunthorpe primary school are being given a lesson on the town's steelmaking at North Lincolnshire Museum, as Sonia Weber rests on a bench outside. The youngsters are learning how Scunthorpe and the surrounding villages of Ashby, Brumby, Crosby and Frodingham grew rapidly following the discovery of iron ore here in 1859. Outside, Ms Weber, 65, the daughter of a German immigrant who came to work in the Lincolnshire town's steelworks after World War Two, says she fears for their future. \"So many people, so many families \u2013 the children \u2013 are going to suffer,\" she says, gesturing towards the museum's front doors. \"The works have been here for many, many years.\" Among the museum's exhibits are maps from 1889, 1908 and 1938. The area's growth is clear. The future is less so. Earlier, British Steel said the blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable\" due to tough market conditions, the imposition of tariffs and higher environmental costs. The BBC understands British Steel was expecting a \u00a31bn injection of government money to keep the business going, but was instead offered \u00a3500m. \"My father, Hans, was very proud to work at the steelworks,\" says Ms Weber, telling of her own connection with the works, which loom over the town. \"He was a strong man. It was a very difficult job. A dangerous job.\" An engraved, heptagonal shield commemorating the loss of 11 men in an incident involving the town's Queen Victoria blast furnace on 4 November 1975 is testimony to that. Like many, Ms Weber \u2013 who grew up hearing stories of blood, sweat and tears \u2013 is dismayed at the news. It is hard to find anyone in Scunthorpe without a link, past or present, to the steelworks. \"I have friends who work there,\" says Kiran Hotchin, 23, a father-of-two. \"Scunthorpe is known for its steelworks. \"A lot of jobs are at stake. I expect a lot of people here are going to end up losing their homes.\" There are nods to steelmaking everywhere. Even the shopping centre is called The Foundry. Kelly Christmas, 29, a support worker at the town's hospital, says her mother and stepfather were both employed as cleaners at the works. \"Wow, that's a lot of people,\" she tells me, responding to the expected job losses. \"It's going to be awful for people, especially those with kids.\" Her friend Sean Robinson, 44, adds: \"Scunthorpe is going to be like a ghost town. Nobody care about us. The government is talking about getting people off benefits but 2,500 people could be out of work soon.\" Ayanda Nyongwana, 43, arrived in the town from South Africa a year ago, and he says the looming towers and chimneys of the steelworks immediately made an impression. \"Scunthorpe is steelmaking,\" the support worker tells me, as we walk down the High Street. \"I believe money circulates, and if 2,500 are going to be out of work that is going to affect a lot of businesses \u2013 big and small.\" Others, though, appear nonchalant. Shane Kirk, 51, owns a garage in the shadow of the works. \"That place has been closing for the past 30 years,\" he says, between mouths of lasagne. \"But it's still open. They just keep cutting back and cutting back. Quite a few companies round here rely on the steelworks.\" Tom Kirkby, 76, agrees there is \"a lot of disillusionment\" in the town, with many people seeing wave after wave of job cuts over recent decades. \"There used to be a lot of good, well-paid jobs here,\" he says. \"I can see people leaving Scunthorpe to find work elsewhere.\" Back in the museum, glass cabinets display physical, personal links to those who helped build the town. Among them are a pair of brown size-10 boots, complete with a completed British Steel Corporation \"application to purchase safety footwear\" receipt. Ms Weber says no-one has any idea who will fill the boots if the shutters come down on the works for good. Listen to highlights from Lincolnshire on BBC Sounds, watch the latest episode of Look North or tell us about a story you think we should be covering here. The trail featuring \"larger-than-life\" bunnies decorated by local school children runs until 28 April. Scunthorpe Litter Pickers shares a picture of waste collected from Everest Playing Fields. Jonathan Lofthouse is on leave following a disagreement with another senior figure, a source says. An inquest opens into the death of University of York student Evan Geoffrey d'Andilly.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Business Insider Edition  President Donald Trump's treatment of US allies is causing some to question their commitment to the US-made F-35, presenting a golden opportunity for European defense companies.  One European jet maker is already trying to capitalize, publicly trying to get wavering countries to buy its jets instead.               Eric Trappier, CEO of France's Dassault Aviation, said on Sunday that his company was ready for US allies unsure about buying the American jet to adopt its Rafale fighter.               He told French newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche that, as long as France's government approved the move, Dassault would be ready to provide its services.               If relationships between the US and its allies deteriorate further, European defense companies could be in a strong position to seize the opportunity.               Richard Aboulafia, an aviation expert and the managing director of US consulting firm AeroDynamic Advisory, told Business Insider that, amid this tension, \"Obviously, the one player that wins big are the European firms that can make an argument to purchase on the basis of national sovereignty.\"               When it comes to European-made jets, \"none of these planes are as good as the F-35,\" he said, but added that: \"If you're Denmark and you're looking at a confrontation in Greenland and you say, 'Wow, the F-35 really does give us elaborate capabilities \u2014 unless we can't use it.'\"               Trump has thrown a wrench in long-standing relationships with European powers, by criticizing defense spending and the NATO alliance in general, while also threatening to annex a European territory and excluding European allies from peace talks over Russia's invasion of Ukraine.               Some nations are now questioning their commitment to the F-35 \u2014 a leading product for the US defense industry that, as a program, is expected to cost more than $2 trillion.               Part of this is down to worries about the future of US weaponry, as countries that buy American weapons must rely on the US manufacturer for parts and services.               Allies turning away from the F-35 would be a big blow to the US defense industry: The F-35 is the West's most advanced jet and is a symbol of US defense strength.               But it's also run years late and billions over budget.               Losing international sales would exacerbate the program's difficulties. Around 35% of Lockheed Martin's F-35 deliveries last year were to the international market, and the company says the program contributes around $72 billion annually to the US economy, and supports 275,000 US jobs.               This loss could give a major boost to European manufacturers.               European defense spending is growing at a faster rate than the US, with many countries needing to replace their arsenals as they give weaponry to Ukraine.       European defense stocks are also soaring, as countries increase their military spending.               Even so, many have struggled with a shortage of manufacturing capability which has left them unable to produce enough weaponry and ammunition, even if they're willing to spend more.               Trump's approach could push Europe faster toward what many warfare experts and European leaders identify as a tipping point: countries placing large enough orders for the defense industry to feel confident enough to massively boost production.               For items as large and complex as fighter jets, this scaling up would still take years.               European leaders are urging the purchasing of European weapons. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said this month that \"we must buy more European\" weapons, and \"that means creating an EU-wide market for defense equipment.\"               Trappier's comments about countries adopting the Rafale fighter jet came as many nations have publicly voiced their uncertainty over plans to move forward with the F-35.               Canada's defense minister said his country was reviewing its contract with Lockheed Martin for F-35s and looking at \"other alternatives,\" while Rasmus Jarlov, chairman of Denmark's parliamentary defense committee, said he regrets choosing the F-35 for his country.               Among other things, Jarlov said he did not believe the Pentagon's denial of rumors the jets could have a \"kill switch\" allowing the US to remotely disable them.               Portugal's defense minister this month said his country was unsure about its plans to transition to the F-35s \u2014 a deal anticipated to be worth $6 billion \u2014 citing the US's posture toward NATO and its allies.               Trappier said he wanted to offer Portugal the jet, adding that the country hadn't contacted France yet but that a request could come in the next few weeks or months.               He also said that Dassault's Rafale production had increased from one jet a month in 2020 to more than two a month this year. Trappier said that would grow to three a month in 2026, and four from 2028-2029.               The company was looking at how to bring that up to five a month, he added, but he didn't give a timeline.               Despite its growth, it's unclear how much the Rafale could make up for any shortfall left by countries canceling or deciding against F-35 orders.               Lockheed Martin produces more than 150 F-35s a year. Even if Dassault makes three a month that would still only be 36 jets.               Mark Cancian, a defense expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told BI that the \"production rate will be an issue\" if allies want to heavily turn to Rafales.               There are similar issues with other European aircraft, like the Swedish-made Gripen and the Eurofighter Typhoon, manufactured by a consortium of Airbus Defense and Space, BAE Systems, and Leonardo.               Many countries still seem committed to their F-35s: A spokesperson for The Netherlands' defense ministry told BI that \"there is no reason to assume that the good cooperation with the US in the F-35 program will change or stop\" and described the F-35 as a joint effort, a jet \"developed, deployed and maintained as a common platform based on a strong partnership with the US and other countries around the world.\"               Germany and the UK have also said they remain committed.               F-35s are considered among the world's most advanced jets, and changing jet type would create additional work that could delay readiness at a time when Europe is increasingly worried about threats from Russia.               Even so, there are signs that many countries are questioning their long-term dependency on US tech and weaponry.               The prime minister of Sweden, which doesn't operate F-35s, said this month that he doesn't view US weaponry as a security threat, but said Sweden and Europe \"would do well from being a little less dependent on the US defense industry.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Ah, the CAN bus. It\u2019s become a communication standard in the automotive world, found in a huge swathe of cars built from the mid-1990s onwards. You\u2019ll also find it in aircraft, ships, and the vast majority of modern tractors and associated farm machines, too. As far as [Randy Glenn] is concerned, though, the CAN bus doesn\u2019t have to be limited to these contexts. It can be useful far beyond its traditional applications with just about any hardware platform you care to use! He came down to tell us all about it at the 2024 Hackaday Supercon.   [Randy]\u2019s talk was titled \u201cYes, You CAN: Use The Controller Area Network Outside Of Cars.\u201d We have to assume the pun was intended. In any case, the CAN bus came to us from Bosch, which began developing the standard in 1983. The company officially released it at the Society of Automotive Engineers conference in 1986, with compatible chips first hitting the market a year later. It took a little while longer for the standard to find traction, with Mercedes-Benz being the first to implement it in a production vehicle in 1991. It soon caught on with the wider industry as a robust and reliable way to let a vehicle\u2019s various control units communicate with all the important sensors that were proliferating on modern automobiles. CAN got its big break when it was mandated as part of the OBD-II standard in North America, which defacto put it into virtually every car sold in that market from 1996 onwards. Since then, CAN has proliferated well beyond the automotive space, into marine and aerospace contexts as well. As [Randy] explains, beyond transportation, you\u2019ll also find it in everything from robots to pinball machines and even elevators. Basically, wherever it\u2019s important to have robust local communication between distributed embedded systems, CAN is a great candidate for the job. Since it\u2019s so widespread, it\u2019s easy to find hardware and software that\u2019s CAN-ready out of the box. The vast majority of microcontroller manufacturers include some sort of CAN compatibility; for example, Espressif\u2019s ESP32 has the \u201cTwo Wire Automotive Interface\u201d which is built for this purpose. Linux is more than happy to talk CAN, too, and most programming languages have some sort of library available, too. Whether you\u2019re working with Arduino, MicroPython, or CircuitPython, you can certainly find what you need. Even if you have a device without CAN built in\u2014like a Raspberry Pi\u2014SPI-ready CAN controllers can be had for cheap from vendors like Microchip. There are specific reasons why you might consider CAN for your embedded communication needs. It uses a differential bus, which gives it an inherent ability to resist disruption from electrical noise. Addressing, error-checking, and retransmission functionality are also baked in to CAN controllers, so you don\u2019t have to handle it yourself. You can also find tons of CAN compatible hardware on the market to do whatever you\u2019re trying to do, and a lot of it is pretty cheap because manufacturers are churning it out by the millions. Of course, there are some limits. Traditionally, you\u2019re stuck with only 32 devices on a bus, though there are some\u00a0ways to work around it at lower data rates. Peak data rate is 1 megabit per second on a traditional CAN bus operating at the high data rate; this limits you to a total bus length of 25 meters. You can up this to 250 meters if you drop to 250 kbit\/s instead. Packets are also limited to 8 bytes in size. Beyond the basic performance specs, [Randy] also explains how you might go about typical implementations with different hardware. For example, if you\u2019ve got a microcontroller with no CAN capability baked in, you might hook it up with a CAN controller and transceiver over SPI. Alternatively, you might choose to work with a more advanced microcontroller that has all the CAN communication hardware built into the chip, simplifying your build. For parts like the ESP32 and some STM32s, you might find you\u2019ve got a CAN controller on board, but you\u2019re lacking the hardware to do the fancy differential signalling\u2014in that case, you just need to hook up a CAN transceiver to get your hardware on the bus. [Randy] also highlights the usual conventions, such as terminology and wire colors, while explaining that these aren\u2019t always rigidly adhered to in the field. On the communication level, the CAN bus standard mandates that nodes transmit frames, with each each frame containing up to 8 bytes of data. [Randy] explains how messages are formatted and addressed to ensure the right nodes get the right data they\u2019re looking for. There are standard message frames, as well as Remote Transmission Request (RTR) frames\u2014where one node requests data from another. A typical example is a controller asking a sensor to report a value. There are also special Error and Control Frames, which [Randy] notes are complicated and beyond the scope of his Supercon talk. However, he recommends resources that exist to explain them in great detail. Much of [Randy\u2019s] talk explains how CAN works. But, as promised, he also takes the time to explain possible non-automotive applications for this technology. He steps through an amusing Halloween build, where a CAN bus is used to trigger scary lightning and sound effects when people press a doorbell. If you\u2019ve ever wanted a good CAN primer, [Randy]\u2019s talk is just what you need. As far as robust embedded communication standards go, it\u2019s one of the most popular and long-lived out there. It might just pay dividends to put the CAN bus in your own toolbox for future use! FWIW there are also level-shifting CAN transceivers, if you need to have the CAN bus a different voltage than some of the nodes, which is very convenient.  Some CAN transceivers can use arbitrary voltages on both sides if you provide reference voltages. The Duet line of 3D printer controller boards can use CAN to talk between the main board and tool boards. It\u2019s pretty well designed and supported. https:\/\/docs.duet3d.com\/User_manual\/Machine_configuration\/CAN_connection A Hackerspace I visited in 2005 had two 125 kBit\/s 24V CAN buses (one for high priority traffic, the other for best effort) going through the whole building, with multiple re-purposed RJ45 plugs in every room. They had a lot of home automation attached and you could plug in your own devices. Using repurposed RJ45 plugs as connectors for the CAN buses is also an inventive approach, given that RJ45 is more commonly associated with Ethernet networking. This choice might have been driven by the availability and cost-effectiveness of RJ45 connectors and infrastructure, as well as the ease of adapting them for CAN bus use. The fact that visitors could plug in their own devices suggests that the hackerspace was encouraging experimentation and collaboration among its members. This open approach to networking and device integration could have facilitated a wide range of projects and innovations, from simple automation tasks to more complex IoT (Internet of Things) applications. What? Is that a bot comment or did you use to much chatGPT? XD Or maybe people are starting to write like they learned from ChatGPT! Pasted Johannes\u2019 comment into Claude, here\u2019s a very similar reply: \u201cThat sounds like quite an innovative setup for 2005! Using CAN buses for home automation was definitely ahead of its time. The Controller Area Network (CAN) protocol is robust and reliable, which makes it perfect for a hackerspace environment where multiple devices need to communicate. Having dual buses \u2013 one for high priority traffic and another for best effort \u2013 was a smart design choice. This would ensure critical systems remained responsive even when the network was busy with less important traffic. Repurposing RJ45 connectors was also practical, since they\u2019re readily available, inexpensive, and have enough conductors for CAN plus power. The 24V power delivery alongside the data lines would have made it convenient to power small devices directly from the network. Were you able to connect any of your own devices to this system? I\u2019m curious what kinds of automation they had implemented throughout the building.\u201d If you don\u2019t need the fancy networking, I\u2019ve used CAN transceivers to move UART signals around. For whatever reason I\u2019ve found it to be a bit more foolproof than RS-485, at least for fools like me. its more common than you think, especially in automotive. its usually not on the main network but its very common to use between boards, IE you have a controller board with a micro that\u2019s on the main bus but its daughter boards are using uart over can so the controller can manage whatever drivers and devices are out there. Does the CAN bus specification specify a limit on nodes within a system?  I didn\u2019t think it did.  I am just confused about what the \u201cstuck with only 32 devices on a bus\u201d statement refers to. The history lesson is a little off.  While 1996 was the start of the OBD2 standard, There were multiple acceptable protocols at the onset.  CAN wasn\u2019t widely used by all the OEMs until the 2000s.  Ford hung onto PWM J1850 until 03 with the 6LPSD and then pretty much whole-fleet by several years later.  GM used J1850 VPW until the 2005 Vette and gradually switched to CAN by 2010.  Honda used ISO KLine until 2005 and was CAN fleet wide by 09.  I\u2019m not quite as familiar with BMW, Merc, VAG and the koreans. bmw\/mercedes\/vag were using canbus for important stuff by the 2000\u2019s and k-line for minor stuff like window syncronisation on a convertible and other minor body functions. nowadays klines still used but its mostly canbus, however vehicles are starting to feature ethernet bridges , along with recent security measures its blurring the lines significantly. theres still canbus under the skirt as it were but its not now like it was. In my workplace we use plenty of CAN (and CAN over EtherCAT). Both are very common for connecting the electric motor drives we use in our robots. \u201cwith each each frame\u201d. Not a chat bot, definitely! Are we surprised about the use of CAN outside of automotive? CiA wants a word! No, not the intelligence agency, but \u201cCAN in Automation\u201d, the consortium from 1992 governing CANopen. I will skip the almost obligatory \u201cCanOpener\u201d joke CAN is just a terrible bus.  Clever in 1986, but today, use Ethernet.  Please. CAN sends data TO a particular address; where does it come from?  nobody knows!  Well, actually\u2026 you have to maintain a separate document showing that some node X receives a message, it must have come from sender Y because that\u2019s who\u2019s supposed to send to X.  You have constraints on addresses, because addresses encode priority (!).  Your payload is 8 bytes, max.  How do you know how long your message is?  See the extra table you have to maintain externally.  Oh, you want to have a sensor repeat a value every millisecond \u2014 better put that in your table, too, and make sure you don\u2019t overload the bus!   RS-485 will run > 10 Mb\/s over 40 feet \u2014 you can run 1 Mb\/s over longer than a football field! In 2025, CAN should be CANned.  Kaput.  Done. Over.  Bad Idea that just won\u2019t die. And there is a significant push towards Ethernet, to be sure. But objectively terrible? I disagree. It might be terrible at the specific application that you envisioned in your mind, but it\u2019s definitely got some merit. First, what you\u2019re describing is pub-sub, and that can also be done on any other physical layer. Max payload is not 8 bytes anymore, modern CAN, CAN FD or CAN XL allows for more bytes \u2013 64 for FD and 2048 for XL. Also, comparing CAN and ETH is not comparing apples to apples, it\u2019s at best comparing apples to\u2026 fruit. But anyway, modern ethernet requires a switch at each node, CAN allows all nodes to share the same collision medium. Yes, there is bigger risk of congestion, but each end device is much simpler and cheaper than if you wanted a typical modern ethernet interface. Also, except for the most modern 10BASE-T1L\/-S you\u2019re looking at more wires to achieve the proper bandwidth. Naturally these are also where the industrial segment is really pushing these days. With APL\/T1L with support for Ex ia and 10Mb over 1km trunk line and robust cable support. But stil you\u2019re looking at a more complex and more expensive communications stack, (hardware and software) which might not necessarily be cost effective for simpler equipment. Bear in mind, LIN bus is also still used in automotive \u2013 with only 16 nodes and 19.2Kb data rate. That will almost certainly never be replaced by ETH directly. BTW; I don\u2019t know what your reference to RS485 was supposed to prove, but CAN physical layer is \/pretty close\/ to RS485 Just to confirm: the pun was intended. Couldn\u2019t think of anything witty, so I went with lower-effort humour. Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"ByBrendan Ahern  ByBrendan Ahern,  Senior Contributor.  CLN Asian equities had a relatively strong day, led by Malaysia and Japan despite the news of a 25% U.S. tariff on imported cars. However, South Korea and Taiwan saw declines of more than 1%. Hong Kong and Mainland China opened lower but managed to grind higher before fading in the afternoon. President Donald Trump\u2019s comments that a TikTok sale in exchange for lower tariffs might have helped. Vice Premier and lead trade negotiator He Lifeng also had a \u201ccandid\u201d conversation with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on trade and fentanyl. You\u2019ll see headlines on how badly January and February industrial profits YTD were -0.3%, which indicates how badly China\u2019s economy is doing. If only the authors behind those headlines had read the report or listened\/read the press conference as industrial sectors aligned with consumer trade-in subsidies, saw profits increase, including auto +11.7% YoY, smart consumer equipment +125.5%, home kitchen appliances +19.9%, and home refrigeration appliances +19.2%. Computer\/communication and electronic equipment were off -9.4% YoY, though as a beneficiary of the new trade-in subsidy, I expect this number will increase. The culprits were private enterprises -9% while profits at large SOEs +2.1%, \u201cjoint-stock enterprises\u201d +2%, and foreign-invested enterprises +4.9%. Hong Kong growth stocks had a decent day, especially against the U.S. tariff headlines led by internet, semis, healthcare, and EV less NIO -5.1% after announcing it will raise $450mm to fund R&D by selling 118.8mm shares. Hong Kong\u2019s most heavily traded by value were Xiaomi -4.17% after its stock sale, Tencent +0.49% after the close announcing it bought 981,000 shares, SMIC +4.24%, Alibaba +0.46%, BYD +2.26%, Meituan +1.81% and Kuaishou +1.34%. Earnings for the day included insurance giant PICC 2024 net profit +88.8%, China Life net profit +108.9% YoY, Bank of China net profit +2.6%, and Apple supplier Goertek net profit +144% YoY while ENN Energy +11.02% on a take-private deal. After strong financial results Wednesday, Mainland investors bought $532mm of Hong Kong stocks, led by Pop Mart +9.924%. Mainland China had a fairly uneventful day bouncing around the room with utilities underperforming. PBOC Deputy Governor Xuan Chang spoke at the Boao Forum for Asia Thursday, reiterating the central bank\u2019s loose monetary policy and will cut the bank reserve requirement ratio and interest rates further at an \u201cappropriate time,\u201d i.e., when the U.S. Fed cuts. JPMorgan joined MS and GS, upgrading their MSCI China targets. However, I feel bad they are stuck using a benchmark filled with slow\/no-growth sectors like financials and energy that aren\u2019t beneficiaries of policy stimulus. The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech gained +0.41% and +0.29% on volume +19.96% from yesterday, which is 144% of the 1-year average. 265 stocks advanced, while 206 declined. Main Board short turnover increased +1.28% from yesterday, which is 156% of the 1-year average, as 17% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers\u2019 ETF hedging). Growth and small caps outperformed value and large caps. The top sectors were healthcare +5.87%, staples +1.84%, and utilities +1.52%, while tech -3.04%, materials -1.32%, and financials -0.4%. The top sub-sectors were consumer durables\/apparel, pharmaceuticals, and consumer services, while technology hardware, nonferrous metals, and national defense were the worst.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  ISRG Stock   Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) stock has seen a remarkable increase of over 27% in the past twelve months, handily beating the broader market as represented by the S&P 500 index, which grew by 9%. This upward trajectory is likely due to the company\u2019s introduction of the da Vinci 5 platform last year, a launch that has revitalized investor sentiment, coupled with the expansion of global procedure volumes. Now that the stock has climbed to the $500 mark, the crucial question is whether it represents a buy, sell, or hold opportunity. We find ISRG to be an appealing yet volatile stock, suggesting caution when considering a purchase at its current price of roughly $510. While we believe the fundamental outlook for ISRG is sound, contributing to its attractiveness, its high valuation renders it particularly vulnerable to adverse events. Notably, ISRG has historically commanded high valuations, a reflection of its strong sales growth. For instance, the company's sales have grown at an average annual rate of 18% over the past four years, and we project a continued growth rate of 14% annually for the next four years.   We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of ISRG stock with its operating performance over the recent years, as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Intuitive Surgical along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, ISRG stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market.  Intuitive Surgical's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Intuitive Surgical's profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Intuitive Surgical's balance sheet looks very strong.  ISRG stock has seen an impact that was slightly worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on ISRG stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Intuitive Surgical Stock Go In A Market Crash? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. In summary, Intuitive Surgical's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: \u2022 Growth: Extremely Strong   \u2022 Profitability: Very Strong   \u2022 Financial Stability: Extremely Strong   \u2022 Downturn Resilience: Neutral   \u2022 Overall: Very Strong Despite its premium valuation, we find ISRG stock to be an attractive pick. With ongoing expansion in global procedure volumes and the da Vinci 5 platform poised to fuel growth through both new placements and the replacement of older models, Intuitive Surgical appears well-positioned for significant gains in the future. We estimate Intuitive Surgical\u2019s valuation at approximately $610, indicating a potential 20% upside from its current price. Not too happy about the volatile nature of ISRG stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

We are not responsible for them in any way.  One consequence of the dotcom bubble was the massive buildup of high-speed internet infrastructure that arguably paved the way for the modern internet.  It'll be interesting to see what use cases start to make sense with a massive glut in datacenter capacity, even if it doesn't turn out to be AI. Every year the computers in the data centers will get less and less relevant. As opposed to all the routers and switches installed in the late 90s?   Some of the investment will be in hardware that falls out of date.  Some of it will be in infrastructure that can be re-used (buildings, redundant power and cooling).  Such is life. A large portion of datacentre investment isn't in the computers inside it, and technology doesn't progress anywhere near as fast as you think. Even now in this article the industry is benchmarking on the lowest tier card from the previous generation for their workloads. Bitcoin farms or foreign hacking & propaganda farms. It's the same thing they did with real estate. There are entire cities with no one living in them in China. And they know it will turn out that way. They use the pointless construction jobs to inflate their economic numbers, one of many ways they manipulate the reports on their economy. they can't keep that house of cards afloat forever (sorry, mixed metaphors)there's a crash coming & if it doesn't collapse the government, it may well trigger a return to the Mao years The \"Mao years\" never ended there is still mass genocide and slave labor in China at 1949-1976 levels. This is exactly the same as the ghost cities anyone thinking otherwise needs to look at the history of the CCP. China has pointless construction jobs, just like the US has pointless office jobs. They learned to manipulate the numbers the way they learned everything else - by copying America. Crash coming, government collapse, cult of the Dear Leader - sounds as much American as Chinese. Like many of the Chinese \"ghost towns\". The Chinese were lead to believe that real estate investment was it, so China ended up developing cities to house populations of tens of millions of people, and many Chinese bought up apartments and stores as investments. Of course, build it, but they didn't come, and many of those cities have less than 1% occupancy, so they're more like ghost towns where a car can have a 5 lane highway to themselves, shopping centers and offices are basically full of \"FOR LEASE\" signs  China will start using the data centers for Bitcoin mining. Are they going to have a rat renaissance? That's what shitloads of empty buildings usually produce. They have wires, which rats love to chew on. Once they chew up all the wires and make a huge mess of the place they'll move on to some other shelter. The rats also use buildings for shelter, which they need just like any other animal that lives where the weather requires it. Rats will also eat wire insulation, PEX water lines, rubber door bottom seals, and a lot of other stuff that isn't food and doesn't provide nourishment. I presume it makes them feel full for a while, and\/or is tasty to them. They especially go nuts for PEX. All the wires are insulated with soy based coating, that's what the rats are attracted to Rats eat wiring insulation no matter what it is made of, as far as I can tell. The big problem with soy based insulation is not rodents, it's time. Mercedes proved that. The insulation degrades with time and heat cycles. That's true of all wiring insulation of course, but it's especially hard on the soy stuff. Hardly. No food there. Most likely they'll be demolished, like those huge empty ghost towns from a decade ago. Ehh...China's urban population is still growing. The countryside is emptying out (or emptied out...it's all old people and maybe their grandkids).Despite all of the ignorant bullshit claims (plus their own propagandistic claims) that they are communist, China is ultracapitalistic. They will not let those people move into the empty residential buildings simply because they are empty and will degrade if they are not occupied, they have to pay. In temperate and colder climates, unoccupied buildings breathe in moisture which does damage to property. Ehh...China's urban population is still growing.

They will not let those people move into the empty residential buildings simply because they are empty and will degrade if they are not occupied, they have to pay. In temperate and colder climates, unoccupied buildings breathe in moisture which does damage to property. They might mothball them. That's what happened with quite a few coal plants that were built but not needed. If the demand ever comes they can be put into action, although it looks like they will be written off unless something dramatically changes. Depends on how well they were constructed and whether they are maintained. Poorly constructed buildings with no maintenance degrade much faster so, after just a few years, the costs of resurrecting exceeds the cost of demolition and rebuild. Given the history of modern China, I'd bet on the latter happening. I assume most of the costs aren't the building but the hardware therein and presumably that'll be out of date within a few years? Mothballing anything but the core building seems like it wouldn't help much. Selling off that hardware will have interesting consequences too. It'd push down prices which feel good given the tariff wars going on, but it'd also presumably cause huge amounts of damage to the manufacturers as they suddenly have to compete against hardware they sold last year. My final concern here, while I'm posting to this article, is this: these can't be the only data centers affected, I assume it's a world wide problem. Which makes me wonder if all of this is going to result in even more AI being forced upon everyone, wanted or not, for the same reasons RTO is being forced upon workers - management made purchasing decisions five years ago that turns out to be completely unnecessary and don't want to write it all off as a mistake in front of shareholders. Are they going to have a rat renaissance? That's what shitloads of empty buildings usually produce.Well, it's China, so it's possible that they could be infested by the digital equivalent of rats. Cheap hosting for state sponsored hackers and malware. Are they going to have a rat renaissance? That's what shitloads of empty buildings usually produce. Well, it's China, so it's possible that they could be infested by the digital equivalent of rats. Cheap hosting for state sponsored hackers and malware. Since AI research requires lots of hardware for training and the required trial and error approach, is this saying that in contrast the the US, Chinese companies are abandoning AI research and the search for new and better models, and that instead, the Chinese companies believe they've already found the models they need or that someone what will develop those models? Or maybe this is saying that only the largest Chinese companies are doing AI research while the others will just use whatever models are developed by those large companies. The article seems to suggest two things. First, AI research, particular with LLMs, is indeed decreasing in China. Apparently development plans have to be registered with the government. Second, the decrease in new data centers appears to be a fallout from small cloud providers who were speculating on demand. It's not clear if the Chinese hyperscalers have scaled back their research. Recent news articles suggest that the hyperscalers are instead ramping up their research efforts. \"The central government designated AI infrastructure as a national priority, urging local governments to accelerate the development of so-called smart computing centers\" And where did the money come from? Mainly from the State. \"State-owned enterprises, publicly traded firms, and state-affiliated funds lined up to invest in them\" I read one article saying there are over 3 billion homes in China.  There are not 3 billion people.  There likely never will be, since the country cannot feed 1.4 billion let alone 3. So you might question the source that claimed there were 3 billion homes.  Not everything you read is factual.  Chinese ghost cities, but many (I dare say most)of them actually filled up. How do you know that? China hides their numbers.

After about five years, any compute gear is obsolete. I'd be surprised if power and air handling equipment lasts ten years. Houses and offices are useful for much longer.

It will be interesting to see what happens in the US.Microsoft has already cancelled several data centers. When will the other big players realize that they are building obsolete facilities. There are  two sides to this though, aren't there?  Wasn't it basically shown that DeepSeek was trained against already existing LLM models and was basically a condensed model?  If that's true, then there still need to be fully trained \"full\" models to condense.  Maybe it means that we need less fully trained models and therefore less giant data centers, but I don't think it means we need zero. This is an interesting article as it shows how a lot of investments end up going to waste instead of creating something of sustainable use. No country wants to be left behind the \"AI revolution\", but it's like investing in beachfront development when it's not clear where the beachfront will be in 2-5 years.  All of these buildings have a high CO2 cost ultimately, and governments are for the most part not considering balancing technology investments with sustainability. All of the big powers are in an arms r  Has little to do with AI, and more to do with China's attitude towards stranded assets. They just don't care. Better to overrun a market and build excess than not. This happened in the USA too.  There was an article just a few days ago about Microsoft backing out of a bunch of datacenter builds. OpenAI announced a year ago that they felt that the future for their AI was going to be in efficiency not in bigger hardware.  Several Chinese AI models have come out recently that are significantly more efficient. MOAR POWA is not the future.  There is still a need for datacenter growth, but not at the rate it was growing during the past couple years. It's kinda too bad.  I was hoping to see nuclear power make a big comeback. Haw Haw This is like China's famous empty cities. Normally, a city is established in a location because of trade routes, a coast or river, an industry, etc. Over time as the city grows, its land becomes more valuable, until eventually the high price for a square foot\/meter is high enough to justify the construction costs of going vertical. When the dirt is so expensive that one must build 50 or 60 floors of office space on a lot in order to justify buying the lot, 50 or 60 story buildings appear.

Don't overpay for Lego The Office at Amazon when you can get the 1,164-brick recreation of Dunder Mifflin with 15 minifigures for retail price at Walmart. By      Steven Petite    on March 27, 2025 at 11:27AM PDT Fans of The Office can pick up Lego's recreation of the Dunder Mifflin Scranton branch at Walmart right now. Though it's not discounted, the 1,164-piece model kit was retired at the end of 2024. It was already difficult to find Lego Ideas: The Office at major retailers for most of last year, so we wouldn't expect Walmart to have this set available for very long.    Lego Ideas: The Office - Scranton Branch (1,164 Pieces)   $120      The $120 Lego Office set is shipped and sold directly from Walmart. For comparison, resellers at Amazon are selling the kit for $150. Despite the higher price, Amazon says it has sold over 300 units over the past month. Do yourself a favor and save $30 by opting for Lego The Office at Walmart instead. You could put the extra cash toward The Office: Complete Series on DVD, which is on sale for $40 (was $75) at Amazon.   $70 ($120) Part of the Lego Ideas line, The Office is a recreation of the Dunder Mifflin office in Scranton, Pennsylvania. The 1,164-piece set builds a segmented model, complete with all of the departments and workstations seen in the show. Lego created minifigures for 15 Dunder Mifflin Scranton employees and a bunch of accessories. The accessories can be used to recreate memorable moments from the iconic workplace comedy series, including Kevin's chili pot fiasco, Michael's screenplay for Threat Level Midnight, Dwight's stash of weapons, and a stapler suspended in gelatin--one of Jim's many superb pranks on Dwight. Michael Scott's office can be removed from the rest of the build to display separately, which could come in handy if you need a breather from his antics after a meeting. Speaking of meetings, the Scranton branch's conference room includes a recreation of the dry erase board and enough space for all the minifigures to watch as minifigure Michael makes a fool of himself again. Here's the list of all 15 minifigures included with Lego Ideas: The Office. You also get a Lego figure of Garbage the Cat.      Amazon may not have Lego The Office in stock, but the retailer recently restocked two other sets that have been very hard to find over the past six months or so. The awesome 1,508-piece Transformers 2-in-1 Optimus Prime Lego set--it converts into a truck--is back in stock and on sale for a big discount. Meanwhile, the newly retired 1,545-piece Indiana Jones: Temple of the Golden Idol Lego set is available once again for its normal $150 price.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"ByNina Bambysheva  ByNina Bambysheva,  Forbes Staff.  Jeremy Allaire, cofounder and CEO of Circle, at the Paris Blockchain Week summit in Paris, France, on April 9, 2024. Photographer: Nathan Laine\/Bloomberg Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)\u2014the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange, which reported revenues of $9.3 billion in 2024 and has a market capitalization of $101 billion\u2014has signed a memorandum of understanding with Circle, issuer of the world\u2019s second-largest stablecoin, to explore integrating Circle\u2019s products into its trading and clearing empire. Stablecoins are digital tokens designed to maintain stable value, typically pegged to fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar. Under the agreement, ICE will evaluate using Circle\u2019s flagship product, $60 billion (market cap) USDC, and US Yield Coin (USYC) across its derivatives exchanges, clearinghouses and data services to develop new markets and products. The latter was launched by Hashnote, a Miami-based firm Circle acquired in January, and offers a yield of 3.8%, backed by short-duration U.S. Treasury bills and repo\/reverse repo activities. \u201cWe believe Circle\u2019s regulated stablecoins and tokenized digital currencies can play a larger role in capital markets as digital currencies become more trusted by market participants as an acceptable equivalent to the U.S. Dollar,\u201d said Lynn Martin, President of the New York Stock Exchange, in an announcement shared with Forbes. Stablecoins are on a tear. Tether\u2019s $144 billion behemoth, USDT, may command the spotlight, but the real draw is how these tokens have transformed from a convenient tool for crypto traders to a popular medium for fast and cost-effective cross-border payments. By February, stablecoins had amassed a combined market value of $214 billion and handled a staggering $35 trillion in annual transfers\u2014double Visa\u2019s throughput, according to data from Dune and Artemis. Traditional finance is taking note. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan recently stated that the bank is prepared to roll out its own stablecoin if Congress signs off on the regulations. Fidelity is already tinkering with a stablecoin under its digital assets division, which currently offers custody and trading for bitcoin, ether and litecoin. Driving the hype is a legislative push championed by the Trump administration, which sees stablecoins as a key way to maintain the U.S. dollar\u2019s global dominance. Two major bills making the rounds in Congress are anticipated to bring stablecoins a clear regulatory framework. Fittingly, World Liberty Financial, a crypto project in which the Trump family has already reaped at least $400 million, said on Tuesday it also plans to launch a stablecoin, backed by U.S. Treasurys, dollars and other cash equivalents.","label":1}
{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  MA Stock   Question: How would you respond if you owned Mastercard stock (NYSE: MA) and it dropped by 40% or more in the next few months? While this might sound dramatic, it's not unprecedented\u2014and it could happen again. Mastercard stock has actually outperformed the broader market in 2025, gaining around 4% since January, whereas the S&P 500 has slipped by 2% during the same period. This strong showing was fueled by better-than-expected Q4 2024 results, driven by increased payment and cross-border volumes. That said, potential headwinds are looming. Overall market sentiment has turned cautious amid rising fears of a U.S. recession triggered by tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump. This could significantly affect Mastercard, given its reliance on consumer spending and international travel trends. Here\u2019s the point: Mastercard stock could face substantial losses in a downturn. In 2020, MA stock dropped by roughly 41% in just a few quarters, and during the inflation-driven sell-off in 2022, it fell around 29%\u2014performing slightly worse than the S&P 500. This raises a key question: Could the stock tumble to $320 in a similar scenario? Individual stocks typically exhibit greater volatility than diversified portfolios. If you're looking for growth with less risk, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has beaten the S&P 500 and delivered returns of over 91% since inception. President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive trade policies\u2014including a 20% tariff on Chinese goods and 25% on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with tighter immigration rules\u2014have sparked fears that inflation could make a comeback. These developments suggest that the U.S. economy may face serious challenges, even tipping into recession, as discussed in our analysis here on the macro picture. Earlier this month, the President didn\u2019t dismiss the idea that these tariffs could prompt a recession. Given the rising uncertainty tied to these policies, the risks are worth watching. Add in global instability like the Ukraine\u2013Russia conflict and ongoing trade disputes, and the economic outlook remains murky. Tariffs raise import costs, push prices higher, cut into consumer purchasing power, and reduce spending. These conditions could negatively affect Mastercard. If rising prices cause consumers to trim discretionary spending, Mastercard may see reduced transaction volumes. A potential recession\u2014bringing job cuts and lower incomes\u2014could worsen the decline in consumer payments. Additionally, companies managing tighter budgets might reduce spending, including on business travel and transactions. If travel slows due to global instability, Mastercard\u2019s high-margin cross-border revenues\u2014which have been growing rapidly\u2014could take a hit, squeezing overall revenue and profitability.

Reviews ethics statement      With IDR applications unfrozen, borrowers can again apply for plans to lower student loan payments. Here's what experts recommend for now.    The Federal Student Aid website has reopened applications for income-driven repayment programs. The Department of Education has reopened applications for income-driven repayment plans, offering a little relief to student loan borrowers who've been in limbo for the past month. IDR plans are student loan repayment programs that cap monthly payments based on a percentage of the borrower's income. It's been an alternative option for borrowers enrolled in the Saving on a Valuable Education plan, which has been on hold for months facing legal challenges. The IDR application was removed from the federal student loan site shortly after an appeals court\u00a0ruled against\u00a0SAVE in February. It has since been made available again with revisions, the Department of Education\u00a0announced Wednesday. While SAVE borrowers can explore other IDR plans, including income-contingent repayment and pay as you earn plans, the ruling against SAVE means that forgiveness at the end of the repayment period is still in limbo. However, experts still recommend borrowers explore IDR plans to potentially reduce their monthly payments. The Trump administration has made it clear that it's opposed to student loan forgiveness programs. President Donald Trump announced plans to shut down\u00a0the Department of Education and have the Small Business Administration \"immediately\" begin handling the entire federal student loan portfolio.   \"We are still awaiting further decisions on what happens at the end of the repayment term for borrowers repaying under these plans,\" said\u00a0Elaine Rubin, a CNET Money Expert Review Board member and advisor for Edvisors. What does all of this mean for your student loans and repayment options? We talked to experts to find out. If you're panicked about the end of SAVE, it's understandable. Although SAVE has not yet been officially canceled, it's likely just a matter of time. Anyone enrolled in SAVE has had their loans placed in an\u00a0administrative forbearance for the past eight months. You won't have to worry about resuming payments until this forbearance has ended. The forbearance period for SAVE borrowers was expected to end at the close of 2025, but it seems likely that payments will resume sooner. \"Those enrolled in the SAVE plan should be paying careful attention to what's going to happen in the next few months, because at some point their loans will enter repayment,\" Rubin said. Experts encourage SAVE borrowers to explore repayment options through other income-driven repayment plans. You can check your eligibility and expected monthly payment options using the loan simulator\u00a0at StudentAid.gov. Other IDR plans currently offer monthly payments that are higher than SAVE, but likely lower than the standard repayment plan. You may find you don't qualify for another IDR plan, however, even if you qualified for SAVE. CNET contributor Dana Miranda recently wrote about exploring her student loan\u00a0repayment options. Without SAVE, she now expects her monthly student loan payment to jump from $0 to $488. While your payments are paused, Rubin suggests taking steps to prepare. This might mean adjusting your budget or working with a financial counselor to assess your options. \"You might be at a standstill, but there are other actions you can take to put yourself in a better financial position,\" Rubin said. \"We've seen people who are putting their expected monthly payment amounts in a high-yield savings account, and others are paying off credit cards and car debts while they can contribute more money to those debts.\" If you're facing financial difficulties, talk to your student loan servicer about deferment or forbearance options. Since other income-driven repayment plans like PAYE and ICR have been written into the law, Rubin says they're less likely to be dismantled completely. For now, Rubin says borrowers should continue making on-time payments. What's less clear is how forgiveness through existing IDRs will shake out. Right now, income-driven repayment plans like PAYE and ICR both offer forgiveness for borrowers after they make 20 to 25 years of qualifying payments. \"Concerns have been raised about what happens at the end of the repayment terms for ICR and PAYE plans now that forgiveness has been blocked,\" Rubin said. \"After 20 or 25 years of payments, there remains uncertainty about how the remaining balance will be managed in the long term.\" If you're enrolled in any income-driven repayment plan and reach the end of your repayment term, Rubin said you'll be placed in an interest-free forbearance period until the court offers a final ruling on student loan forgiveness. The government's Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program\u00a0\u2014 which can help teachers, nurses and other public servants get their loan balances forgiven after 10 years of payments \u2014 is still in effect. For those currently enrolled in PSLF, the plan appears safe for now. During her confirmation hearing for education secretary last month, Linda McMahon told senators that the Department of Education would honor the Public Student Loan Forgiveness Program because it was created by Congress. However, for borrowers enrolled in SAVE who are working toward PSLF, debt relief could take longer. While your loans remain on hold during the administrative forbearance period, you won't receive on-time payment credit toward PSLF. This could stretch out your repayment timeline. There's another wrinkle for federal employees: As the Trump administration takes aim at shrinking the size of the federal workforce, public workers who have been laid off may no longer qualify for PSLF. The plan does allow for participants to resume PSLF if they get another public service job. If you have federal loans that are eligible for PSLF and you've worked in public service for 10 years or more, you may be eligible for forgiveness sooner through the PSLF buy-back program.\u00a0Here's how it works. If you're thinking about refinancing your federal student loans with a private lender, experts say to proceed with a high degree of caution. When you refinance your federal student loans with a private lender, you forfeit any perks federal loans offer, including forgiveness, debt relief, income-driven repayment options and administrative forbearances, like the SAVE payment pause. \"It's very rarely recommended,\" Rubin said. \"If you're struggling in the federal market, the private market is likely going to present even more challenges. Just because you see low, appealing rates advertised, it doesn't mean you'll get that rate. We have seen buyers with good to excellent credit not get the kind of rates they expected.\"","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Fukushima. Three Mile Island. Chernobyl. Places that will forever be remembered as the sites of nuclear disasters. Most people will have heard of them. But fewer are aware of the Windscale fire. It was one of the world's first - and remains the UK's worst - nuclear accident. A nuclear reactor at the site in Cumbria caught fire on 10 October 1957 and burned for three days, releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere. Many details of the event were kept quiet for decades, and it is far less famous than some of the more recent examples. But a new video game has brought the disaster, and the area where it happened, back into the spotlight. Atomfall is the latest release from Oxford-based Rebellion, best known for its long-running Sniper Elite series. CEO Jason Kingsley tells BBC Newsbeat he was walking in the Lake District when the idea of using the real-life Windscale story \"as a trigger point for a fictionalised version of the disaster\" began to take shape. Atomfall is a survival action game set in the rolling green landscapes of the beauty spot, but on an alternative sci-fi inspired timeline where the area surrounding the plant has become a quarantine zone. \"It went pretty wrong in real life, but it was controlled,\" says Jason.  \"It was a proper disaster, but it didn't cause strange glowing plants or mutants or dangerous cults to emerge.\" Although the Windscale fire was \"very serious\", Jason says it's not something that is especially well-remembered, even among locals. It was previously estimated about 240 cases of cancer were caused by the radioactive leak, but more recent research has suggested a link was unlikely. Scientists suggested a decision to destroy all milk produced within 310 square miles (800 square km) of the site for a month after the fire helped to prevent exposure. Windscale was eventually renamed Sellafield and produced nuclear power until 2003. It still employs about 10,000 people in the local area. When Newsbeat visits Cumbria, most young people we speak to say they haven't heard of the disaster. And indie game developers Hannah Roberts and Harry Howson say that they became more aware of it once the game was announced. For two people like them, who hope to break into the games industry, they're excited to see a game set in the place where they live. Hannah, 26, says it's evident Atomfall's makers have done their research.  \"The actual environments are spot on, they've got fantastic Morris dancing stuff going on - it really tickled me when I saw that,\" she says.  Hannah says other small details - like black and white Cumbrian signposts - were also pleasing to see. Atomfall's setting and its inspiration have made it an anticipated title since it was first revealed last year, and Harry, 23, says that's been encouraging for him.  \"Seeing that such a small space like Cumbria can be taken by the games industry and built upon and people are receptive to that, it's exciting for the future and I look forward to seeing what's next for me,\" he says. It's fairly unusual for high-profile games set in the UK to be set outside London.  While indie games - such as the Shropshire-set Everybody's Gone to the Rapture and last year's Barnsley-based laughfest Thank Goodness You're Here! - have ventured further north, bigger games haven't tended to stray beyond the M25. Jason says the US is about 40% of the video games market, so it's important to appeal to players there, and there's a \"natural tendency\" to follow the norms. Being an independent company, he feels, allows Rebellion to do things differently, and Britain offers lots of inspiration for new settings - if you're prepared to look for them. \"The UK, I think, to understand certain aspects of our culture, you've got to dig into it a little bit because we tend to understate things quite a lot.\" Rebellion's Head of Design Ben Fisher says the goal was to create a \"slightly theme parkish\" version of the Lake District with accurate details. \"There are things that, as locals, it's easy for us to forget are unique to Britain, that are unusual,\" he says. The team that worked on the game has members from various countries, Ben says, which helped to highlight things the UK natives might have missed. \"The lead artist on the project is from Seattle and was mystified by dry stone walls,\"  says Ben. He adds the team spent time recreating the structures - which are constructed without the use of mortar - to \"capture those local details\". Featuring a local area in a film or TV show can expose a new audience to that place. \"Ultimately, what's incredibly rewarding about this industry is you can put your ideas down and they can be played by people across the globe,\" Jason says. \"And you know, how wonderful is it to sort of talk about the Lake District to people that live in Africa or Southeast Asia or Canada or wherever it might be.  \"That's a kind of form of soft power that very few types of media have.\" Oliver Hodgson, 21, can see Sellafield from his bedroom window. He hopes that the local area will benefit from some of the soft power Jason describes. \"I think it's just an incredibly powerful thing for young people in west Cumbria,\" he says.  \"I think it's really positive to see such a big gaming developer set a story in Cumbria, which is normally just known for its lakes and mountains,\" he says. Oliver who runs his own PR firm, is working with the creators of a project to create a \u00a34m gaming hub in Whitehaven aimed at boosting digital skills in the area. Oliver says he's glad the game has taken its inspiration from Windscale and is drawing attention to the area, as well as switching locals on to their history. \"I think we should own it,\u201d he says.  \u201cThe story of the Windscale disaster obviously isn't a positive one but we can't rewrite history.  \"So acknowledging what happened and teaching and letting young people learn about that history, if this is what brings it into the classroom or on to young people's phones or their social media, then so be it.\" Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"     The new $799 phone uses a small OLED display to make it faster to knock out the essentials.    The Light Phone 3 has a 3.92-inch OLED display that runs in black and white. The Light Phone 3, the newest take on the company's minimalist phone line, launched Thursday, nine months after its announcement. The $799 phone (which is currently $599 as an early sale price) is a substantial price hike from the $299 Light Phone 2, but the new phone swaps out the E Ink display for a 3.92-inch OLED display that the company says makes it faster. Despite the speed boost, the Light Phone 3 only includes a few features, the menu interface will be in black and white, and the phone does not include an app store for adding new ones. You'll see basic phone and texting features -- with support for group chats over SMS and MMS -- along with a navigation app for directions. The phone's body includes a metal frame, a fingerprint sensor, a dedicated two-step shutter button for the 50-megapixel main camera and a USB-C port for charging. The Light Phone 3 also includes hardware for potential features that are still in development, such as NFC for a digital wallet and a front-facing 8-megapixel camera for video calls.\u00a0 Even though it's unlikely you'll be filling up the phone with media outside of music and photos, it does include 128GB of storage along with 6GB of RAM. There's also apps for alarms, a calculator, notes, music, podcasts, a calendar, timers and turning on a hotspot. The Light Phone 3 occupies a niche for people who want a lower-key device to cut down on distractions, but aren't bothered by a higher price to get some increased functionality. And there are increasingly more devices that support this desire for simplicity, although it's also not hard to find them at a lower price. For instance, HMD's $129 Barbie Phone is a simple flip phone in hot pink, which embraces nostalgia just as hard as it also shuns social media apps. The prior Light Phone 2 will also remain on sale at its $299 price. The Light Phone 3 starts shipping to anyone who preordered the phone before Thursday and is expected to arrive in April and May. Those who order it now should expect the phone to arrive in June. The Light Phone 3 is also getting limited release at select Boost Mobile stores in New York. The Light Phone 3 is also coming at a time when slimmer phones are making their way into the market, including Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S25 Edge. Similarly thin concept devices were also a highlight at this year's Mobile World Congress, including Tecno's Spark Slim that weighs in at just 146 grams. If you are looking for other less complicated phones that are also cheaper, check out our lists of best phones under $200 and $300. While they are unlikely to count as \"minimalist\" due to their access to the Google Play Store, these Android phones can be easily used as a simpler device by cutting down on the apps and services stored on the phone itself.","label":0}

John McCoy\/Getty Images                                       hide caption  LOS ANGELES \u2014 The 2025 Major League Baseball season gets fully underway Thursday, with 14 games. One team is the overwhelming favorite to win the World Series \u2014 the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers, who are the defending champions, are led by Japanese superstar and the biggest name in baseball, Shohei Ohtani. And they may have an even better team this season. The first of the games, featuring 28 of the 30 teams, will feature the New York Yankees against the Milwaukee Brewers at Yankee Stadium. The Dodgers open against the Detroit Tigers at Dodger Stadium. During the offseason Los Angeles' deep-pocketed ownership group worth many billions of dollars, spent lavishly to acquire a number of highly sought free agents. The biggest among those acquisitions is another Japanese star, right-handed pitcher Roki Sasaki. The 2025 Dodger payroll is more than $320 million, the largest in baseball, prompting some fans of opposing teams to label the Dodgers, perhaps enviously, \"the Evil Empire.\" The New York Mets will be another closely watched team this season. During the offseason the Mets, owned by billionaire hedge fund manager Steve Cohen, signed the biggest free agent of them all this year. They persuaded Juan Soto to leave crosstown rivals, the New York Yankees. The 26-year-old Dominican agreed to a 15-year contract worth $765 million \u2014 the richest contract in baseball history.                  Juan Soto of the New York Mets hits a single against the St. Louis Cardinals at a spring training game on Feb. 24, 2025, in Jupiter, Fla.                                                           Rich Storry\/Getty Images                                       hide caption  Soto says he decided to move from the Bronx to Queens, motivated by the Mets' desire to win. \"Definitely that was one of the things that opened my eyes, more, how hungry they are to win a championship and build a dynasty,\" he said when he signed. The Mets are viewed as the biggest threat to the Dodgers in the National League, along with the Atlanta Braves and Philadelphia Phillies. In the American League the Yankees are still thought by many to be the team to beat despite losing two of their key players from 2024. In addition to Soto, the Yankees will also be without the ace of their pitching staff. Gerrit Cole underwent Tommy John surgery earlier this month to repair a torn right ulnar collateral ligament and will miss the entire 2025 season. The Yankees hope the impact of those losses will be lessened by their signing of free agent pitcher Max Fried, who last year played for the Atlanta Braves. Other teams in the American League to keep an eye on this season include the Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland Guardians and Boston Red Sox. Two other teams will play their entire home schedules at very small and unusual ballparks. The Tampa Bay Rays are not able to play their home games at their regular stadium, Tropicana Field, which was damaged last October by Hurricane Milton. Their home in 2025 will be Steinbrenner Field, the spring training park for the Yankees. Meanwhile, the team formerly known as the Oakland A's will play their home games in West Sacramento, Calif., at the ballpark used by the minor league Sacramento River Cats. The A's are set to move to Las Vegas but the new stadium being planned on the Vegas Strip isn't expected to be ready until 2028. This season the name of the team will not include any city. The team will simply be called the \"A's\" or the \"Athletics.\" At the beginning of the season, it is difficult to imagine a scenario where the best bankrolled teams don't end near the top at the end of the season. And that's a growing concern among some baseball observers who worry about the issue of competitive balance. A constant question is whether small market and less wealthy teams can realistically compete against the mega-wealthy clubs. If this turns out to be a season where the \"haves\" again dominate the \"have nots,\" we can expect increased calls pushing for baseball to adopt some type of salary cap.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Business Insider Edition  President Donald Trump finally announced 25% tariffs on auto imports on Wednesday, which he said would push automakers to expand production in the US.          Here's what industry figures and politicians are saying about the decision.                The United Auto Workers union praised the move it said would help reverse more than 30 years of free trade policies that had devastated the US auto industry.               \"Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today's actions,\" UAW president Shawn Fain said in a statement.               The union expects the tariffs will push automakers, including the Big Three of GM, Ford and Stellantis as well as foreign companies such as Volkswagen, to invest more in the US and potentially create thousands of jobs.               The union argued that underutilized plants could quickly scale up production, reversing thousands of layoffs they attributed to the outsourcing to Mexico.               While Tesla produces its cars in the US, CEO Elon Musk\u00a0said\u00a0on X the tariffs would still have a \"significant\" impact on his EV company meaning it was \"not unscathed here.\"               \"To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries,\" he posted on Wednesday, adding that the cost impact is \"not trivial.\"               The tariffs come as Tesla faces challenges including US registrations falling by 11% in January and European sales sliding 42% in January and February.               Japan, the second-largest exporter of vehicles to the US after Mexico, warned of a strong response. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said \"every option\" was under consideration, and his government called the tariffs \"extremely regrettable\" and a threat to bilateral relations.               South Korea's industry minister, Ahn Duk-Geun, said Korean automakers faced \"considerable difficulties\" and would announce emergency measures.               European automakers also sounded the alarm. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association warned that tariffs would hurt both global automakers and US domestic manufacturing, as European manufacturers export 50% to 60% of the cars they make in the US.               \"We urge President Trump to consider the negative impact of tariffs not only on global automakers but on US domestic manufacturing as well,\" said the association's director-general Sigrid de Vries in a statement sent to Business Insider.               European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen\u00a0said\u00a0she \"deeply regretted\" the US decision to impose tariffs, while UK finance minister Rachel Reeves said Britain would not escalate trade tensions.               While Honda produces most of its cars for the American market in the US, rivals including Toyota, Nissan, Hyundai\/Kia, Volkswagen, and Stellantis rely heavily on imports, making them particularly exposed to the tariffs.               Autos Drive America, representing foreign automakers like Honda and Toyota, warned the tariffs would lead to higher car prices, fewer choices for consumers, and job losses.               \"The tariffs imposed today will make it more expensive to produce and sell cars in the United States, ultimately leading to higher prices, fewer options for consumers, and fewer manufacturing jobs in the US,\" said Jennifer Safavian, the CEO of Autos Drive America.

The departures are unrelated.          Neary, who joined Meta in 2013, announced his decision to step down in a LinkedIn post on Thursday. He described the move as the end of a \"12-year run,\" during which he helped grow the company's business across the Asia-Pacific region.               Based in Singapore, he oversaw Meta's expansion in some of its largest and fastest-growing international markets, including Australia, Southeast Asia, and Greater China.               \"It's hugely gratifying for me to look back at the small Singapore office where this journey started over a decade ago and see how far we have come together,\" Neary wrote. \"It's been the ride of a lifetime on the Meta APAC rocket ship.\"               He added that he would remain for a few months to help with the leadership transition before taking a break to spend time with family and explore the next steps.               Neary's exit marks the end of an era for Meta's Asia-Pacific operations, which have seen explosive growth over the past decade. Asia is now Meta's largest user base, home to over a billion accounts across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.               Meta's platforms have become essential for communication, commerce, and digital advertising in India, Indonesia, and Thailand. The region also continues to be a key driver of Meta's business messaging and performance ad revenue.               Hamill, who spent 13 years at Meta, will join Pinterest as vice president of enterprise sales for North America starting April 7. She will oversee revenue and sales teams in the US and Canada and work closely with Pinterest's Chief Revenue Officer, Bill Watkins.               Hamill led Meta's advertising relationships across major verticals, including retail, travel, entertainment, and gaming. She also worked closely with product teams on offerings like mobile app ads.               In a LinkedIn post earlier this week, she said she was drawn to Pinterest's focus on \"AI-driven and lower funnel ad solutions \" and the company's mission to build a \"more positive online space\".               Her departure is notable given her role in strengthening Meta's ties with major US advertisers during a period of rapid growth in its ads business. She helped launch and scale tools like Advantage+, automatically optimizing ads to reach likely buyers using AI. Advertising remains Meta's primary source of revenue.               Neither executive gave a specific reason for their departure.               A Meta spokesperson told Bloomberg, that Neary took the company's Asia Pacific business to \"incredible heights, delivering consistently strong results over the years.\"       Have a tip?

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"General Motors\u2019 (GM), Ford Motor\u2019s (F), and Ferrari\u2019s (RACE) earnings are likelier than ever to take a hit, as President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cdraconian\u201d tariffs and anti-electric vehicle policies hang over the automakers, according to JPMorgan (JPM) analysts.  The Trump administration\u2019s new 25% tariffs on all imports of parts and finished cars and trucks are set to go into effect on April 3. Almost half of all vehicles sold in the U.S. are imported, as are almost 60% of all parts in vehicles assembled in the U.S.  \u201cAnybody who has plants in the United States, it\u2019s going to be good for,\u201d Trump said Wednesday of his tariffs. JPMorgan analysts led by Ryan Brinkman lowered their December price target for GM to $53 per share from $64 per share, for Ford to $11 per share from $13 per share, and for Ferrari to $460 per share from $525 per share, according to a Thursday note.  GM stock dropped 3% on Wednesday as Trump made his auto tariff announcement, then slipped as much as 6.5% on Thursday. Ferrari\u2019s stock slid almost 5% on Wednesday but rose 1.6% on Thursday. Ford shares are down 2%. The S&P 500 Automobiles sub-index is up almost 2%, but down 28% year-to-date. Automakers had received a brief break from Trump\u2019s earlier 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada after the president said all vehicles covered by the USMCA trade pact would not be subject to duties for one month. That exemption, which primarily benefitted companies like GM and Ford, ends next week. JPMorgan expects GM to face a $10.5 billion tariff bill, which could rise to $13 billion over time. The automaker imports vehicles from South Korea, Canada, and Mexico. Ford\u2019s bill will be much lower, $2 billion to start, but will gradually rise to $4.5 billion. The analysts now expect the auto industry to take a $82 billion annual hit, up from an initial estimate of $41 billion, assuming that automakers absorb the cost of the tariffs. If they decide to pass the costs on to consumers, light-vehicle prices could rise by up to 11.4%.  The Michigan-based Anderson Economic Group previously estimated that a 25% tariff on Mexico and Canadian imports would add between $4,000 and $10,000 per unit to vehicles assembled in North America. Trump\u2019s tariffs on imports of aluminum and steel add another $250 to $800 per gas-powered vehicle and up to $2,500 on EVs. \u201cUnder the new scheme virtually all automakers will face significant pressure to raise prices, making it more likely domestic automakers will be able to effect price increases to better offset tariff costs without the risk of material market share loss,\u201d Brinkman said in the note. Ferrari on Thursday became the first automaker to raise prices in response to Trump\u2019s new tariff threat. The Italian company said exports to the U.S. after the tariffs take effect will be priced up by as much as 10%. However, exports of Ferrari 296, SF90, and Roma vehicles will not be subject to higher prices.  The tariffs are expected to stick around. When asked how long the duties would likely stay in effect, Trump said they would be permanent. While practically all automakers have been making moves to lessen the effect of Trump\u2019s tariffs, they still expect damage. \u201cLet\u2019s be real honest: Long term, a 25% tariff across the Mexico and Canada borders would blow a hole in the U.S. industry that we\u2019ve never seen,\u201d Ford CEO Jim Farley said in February.

If you're ready to cut down on coffee, here's why you should switch your choice of morning beverage.    Though it's been estimated that about 85% of US adults enjoy up to two cups of coffee daily, not everyone enjoys coffee or its effects (caffeine jitters or trouble sleeping, anyone?). If you're looking for an alternative that will still give you an energy boost, green tea is a popular and tasty caffeinated beverage. It has three times less caffeine than coffee, and it's packed with health benefits.  If you're interested in switching from coffee to green tea or simply want to enjoy more green tea during the day, here's everything you need to know about its benefits and the process of making the change.  Green tea has a long history dating back to about 3000 BC in China. Its beginnings as a medicinal beverage led to green tea becoming one of the world's most popular drinks; the global tea market is now worth over $300 billion. Green tea is an unoxidized tea that comes from the camellia sinensis plant. It grows in Asia, primarily in China and Japan. The tea leaves are plucked and then heated to prevent oxidation and preserve catechins, a natural flavonoid compound with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Leaves are then rolled and dried, though the processing method can differ depending on region. A few popular types of green tea include: Green tea is the most widely consumed tea and has the most health benefits, making up around 20% of the global tea production market.\u00a0 Water temperature and steeping time vary by tea type. The ideal way to prepare green tea is to steep it for around three minutes using water at a temperature of 180 to 185 degrees Fahrenheit. Your tea could become astringent from the release of tannins if you use water that's too hot. Consider an electric water kettle that allows you to set the temperature for the best results.\u00a0 A cup of green tea has between 15 to 48mg of caffeine per 8oz serving. The caffeine content goes up if you steep past three minutes, but goes down if you reuse the tea bag. I'm a coffee and tea lover. A typical day used to start with one or two cups of hot, steamy coffee. Then, I would switch to green or herbal tea and water to stay\u00a0hydrated. But I began to notice that I was getting jittery, and my stomach wasn't feeling so great, even with just one cup of coffee. I decided to swap out coffee for green tea to see what would happen to my body. I wasn't as jittery anymore, but I still had focus. \"Thanks to its L-theanine content, green tea provides a more sustained and calm focus, without the jitteriness or crash that some experience with coffee,\" said\u00a0Alison Tierney, board-certified oncology dietician and cancer survivor. My stomach is also feeling a lot better. Tierney mentioned that \"coffee can be harsh on the stomach due to its acidity, while green tea is typically easier to tolerate,\" which I agree with. Dr. Raj Dasgupta, chief medical advisor for Garage Gym Reviews, sums up the benefits I've experienced well: \"Over time, you'll likely notice more stable energy, better hydration and less stomach irritation since green tea is easier on digestion than coffee.\" Looking for a caffeine-free alternative? Check out herbal teas, a blend of herbs, spices and plant material that typically don't contain caffeine (chamomile is one of my favorites). You can also try new teas through a tea club or subscription. Although you can drink green tea for some health benefits, it may also be beneficial in other forms, such as extracts, topical applications and supplements. Check out some of the hidden health benefits of green tea, backed by experts and scientific research.\u00a0 Multiple longitudinal studies suggest that drinking green tea may help you live longer by reducing your risk of disease and all-cause mortality. Almost 500,000 participants in a study published in 2022, with follow-up after 11 years, found that those who drank at least two cups of green tea per day had a lower all-cause mortality risk. Including coffee with tea had similar results. A 2016 cohort study of 6,517 middle-aged and elderly Chinese adults yielded similar findings, particularly among those who had never smoked. Similarly, after a 15-year follow-up of over 164,000 healthy Chinese men, a different 2016 study found that green tea may lower the risk of dying and developing\u00a0cancer and cardiovascular disease. According to a 2019 Japanese study, women who drank one to two cups of tea daily had lower rates of respiratory disease and cancer mortality, and those who drank three or more cups a day had a lower risk of death from all causes, particularly cardiovascular disease. Type 2 diabetes is becoming more prevalent, with as much as 95% of the diabetic population being diagnosed with type 2, according to the CDC. Some studies suggest regular green tea consumption of at least two cups per day may reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. A 2023 meta-analysis of 17 trials shows a potential link between green tea consumption and lower fasting glucose and HbA1c levels. Researchers in a 2019 study of 40- to 79-year-old Japanese citizens found green tea consumption may reduce type 2 diabetes risk by increasing serum ethylamine. A 2020 study in Japan involved nearly 5,000 people with type 2 diabetes. It concluded that drinking two cups of coffee and green tea daily could lower the risk of death compared to drinking only one of the beverages. Green tea compounds, such as epigallocatechin-3 gallate (EGCG) and L-theanine, might help protect against age-related cognitive decline, preserving memory and reducing dementia risk. Middle-aged and older adults who drank green tea at least once a week showed a 64% lower risk of cognitive impairment, according to a 2020 study.\u00a0 A separate 2020 study showed a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers associated with increased Alzheimer's risk. Despite its promise, additional research is necessary to pinpoint the specific green tea compounds that benefit the brain and memory of habitual drinkers. If you're looking to burn fat and build muscle, green tea extract may help. Researchers in a 2021 review determined that green tea consumption may improve weightlifting results more than from exercises alone. A 2013 study found GTE may boost fat oxidation by up to 17% during a moderate-intensity cycling session. \"One of the ways I personally use green tea extract is right before a cardio session,\" said Terry Tateossian, ISSA-certified nutritionist and founder of THOR: The House of Rose, a group and individual wellness coaching company. \"I would keep its use limited to a pre-workout drink that enhances fat burning, endurance, focus and recovery, all while keeping you hydrated and energized,\" Tateossian continued.\u00a0 She recommends a cup of green tea 30 to 45 minutes prior to working out or an extract with 200 to 300mg of EGCG, but lower in caffeine to avoid overstimulation.\u00a0 That said, the conclusion of the 2013 study found that green tea extract may increase fat oxidation at rest better than while exercising, so more research is needed.\u00a0 Green tea extract supplementation may improve lipid and glycemic profiles, reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease, according to a 2021 meta-analysis of 55 randomized controlled trials. A 2022 study of 18,609 people showed a link between green tea consumption and a lower risk of heart disease, even in those with high blood pressure. Drinking two or more cups of coffee per day increases the risk of heart disease for people with severe hypertension. Though a 2022 genetic analysis didn't find a correlation between green tea and a lower risk of heart disease, it found it significantly reduces stroke, heart failure and hypertension risks.\u00a0 Loss of bone density, or osteoporosis, makes you more susceptible to breakage, but green tea may help strengthen your bones. Women over 50 are most likely to develop osteoporosis. Green tea is high in antioxidants, which may improve bone formation and preserve volume and thickness, according to a 2011 review of rat studies.\u00a0 A 2017 meta-analysis of 17 studies found that green tea polyphenols may limit bone loss, especially in women who don't drink alcohol or smoke. One 2009 study suggests that green tea may help prevent osteoporosis by balancing out bone metabolism and reducing the chance of bone loss before it begins, though more human studies are needed.\u00a0 According to the Stroke Awareness Foundation, strokes affect almost 800,000 Americans per year, with around 140,000 deaths annually. Consuming green tea regularly may reduce your risk of a stroke. A 2009 meta-analysis of nine studies found that consuming three or more cups of green tea daily can reduce your risk of stroke by 21%. An ischemic stroke blocks blood supply to the brain and accounts for around 87% of strokes, according to the American Stroke Association. A 2012 meta-analysis of 14 studies found that drinking at least three cups per day reduced the risk of ischemic stroke by as much as 13%. In a large 2013 cohort study of over 82,000 Japanese people, researchers found that drinking at least four cups of green tea or two cups of coffee per day reduced stroke risk by 20%. A 2019 study of more than 46,200 people over 18.5 years found that between one and six cups of green tea daily lowered death risk post-stroke or heart attack. For those without stroke or heart attack history, green tea and coffee consumption improved outcomes compared to non-drinkers. Green tea has the highest concentration of the amino acid L-theanine compared to other teas, which may help lower your anxiety and stress levels.\u00a0 In a 2017 study of 20 students, those who drank low-caffeine green tea were found to have a lower stress response than the placebo group. Another 2017 study of middle-aged individuals also found lower stress markers in the green tea group, which also improved their sleep quality compared to the placebo group.\u00a0 In a 2019 RCT of 30 people who were supplemented with 200mg of L-theanine per day for four weeks, the supplement group had lower anxiety and stress scores and higher cognitive function scores than the placebo group. Keep in mind, though, that the average cup of green tea has around 15mg of L-theanine.\u00a0 Caroline Igo, CNET wellness editor, is a lifelong fan of green tea. Instead of drinking coffee, she prefers tea since it contains lower levels of caffeine and doesn't leave her jittery. Here are some of her favorite green teas that she drinks daily.\u00a0 This is one of the best green teas on the market. It combines organic green tea with organic lemon verbena, organic spearmint, organic lemongrass and organic lemon oil. The tea has a very neutral taste that is not overpowering, thanks to the added citrus and minty flavors. It is sold at your local grocery store and Amazon.\u00a0 This tea from Teapigs is exactly what you think of green tea: earthy and light. When steeped, the tea is pale green color, not dark and murky. Each tea bag contains pure mao feng green tea. This brand might not be best for someone new to green tea, but tea lovers should appreciate the taste. When it comes to quality tea, Tea Forte is owning the game. The brand offers many gift boxes where you can mix-and-match different teas to try. However, we recommend the Jasmine green tea. Its flowery scent and flavor is well-balanced. You can opt for a 1-pound bag of loose leaf or a box of individual tea bags.\u00a0 If you happen to be taking a trip to Trader Joe's soon, add the Moroccan Mint green tea to your cart. It is minty, light and neutral -- very similar to the Tazo Zen tea. This is a great green tea for those who don't like earthy-tasting teas. Find at Trader Joe's or Amazon. Full of antioxidants and protectant compounds, green tea has a long history of providing a wide range of health benefits. Regular consumption of two or more cups per day may reduce your risk of disease, enhance fat burning and help you live longer. If you're considering cutting down on your coffee consumption, you may want to switch to green tea.\u00a0","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya are seeking back pay and reinstatement. Two former Federal Trade Commissioners are suing the Trump administration for moving to fire them last week, arguing it violates federal law. Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro M. Bedoya have filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia aiming to reverse President Donald Trump's decision to fire them without cause, they said. \"We are trying to vindicate the law that Congress passed, that has been in place for over a century to protect accountability and transparency at the FTC,\" Slaughter told ABC News. \"To make sure that commissioners and the work of the commission is done without fear or favor, and more specifically, that we can take on the biggest companies in America without fear of getting fired for failure to do a favor to the President's friends or donors or corporate allies.\" The FTC, which regulates major tech companies, such as Facebook and Amazon, has also recently cracked down on junk fees, including those for concert tickets and hotel resort fees and simplified the process for unsubscribing from hard-to-cancel services like gym memberships. The board usually consists of five members: three from the president's party and two from the opposition. In the termination letters last week, an official from the Trump administration informed Slaughter and Bedoya, the Democratic members, that their service at the FTC was \"inconsistent\" with the administration's policies but did not provide any further details. Slaughter and Bedoya point to a 1935 Supreme Court precedent that prohibits the president from removing FTC commissioners except for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\" \"This is a very obvious violation of the law, and we hope will be reinstated in short order,\" Bedoya said. The lawsuit demands back pay and reinstatement to their positions. In addition to Elon Musk, Trump has sought close ties with other tech CEOs, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, who were invited to Trump's inauguration. The former FTC commissioners said they don't know if Trump's relationships with the heads of tech companies had anything to do with their dismissal. \"It certainly raises the specter of that kind of interference and corruption,\" Slaughter said. \"We won't know without the presence of minority commissioners at the FTC why it's taking the actions it's taking and whether they're in line with the law.\" Bedoya added, \"Some of the recent, I would say, chaotic moves from the White House are a real concern, not just for consumers, but also for the market. If you want small businesses and startups to succeed, you want a stable, predictable market where big companies can't just snuff you out, not by issuing a better product, but just throwing their weight around to stop you. That is the kind of work FTC does, and that's what I fear will go away.\" 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"NEW THINKING Nike\u2019s collaboration with Skims, Kim Kardashian\u2019s billion-dollar shapewear empire, is one of the most talked-about partnerships in years. Within days of the announcement, Nike\u2019s market cap surged by $6 billion, a clear signal that investors saw financial upside. But beneath the headlines and the initial stock jump, there\u2019s a more pressing question: Is this a strategic evolution for Nike, or just another reactionary move to maintain cultural relevance? Nike has always been the brand that led culture, not chased it, but recent years have painted a different picture. This Skims partnership could be a glimpse into Nike\u2019s future, or it could be another short-term, hype-driven distraction that fails to address deeper issues. This article is part of Branding Strategy Insider\u2019s newsletter. You can sign up here to get thought pieces like this sent to your inbox. To understand what this deal means, let\u2019s break it down: How We Got Here: The Shift from Innovation to Influence Nike built its empire on performance, innovation, and athlete-driven storytelling. But in the past decade, Nike has shifted from product-first innovation to culture-first collaborations, leaning on hype cycles, limited drops, and celebrity partnerships to drive interest. The problem? It\u2019s a short-term strategy that can inflate brand heat but doesn\u2019t create lasting differentiation. Meanwhile, competitors like Lululemon, On Running, and Hoka are winning with actual product innovation. Enter Skims\u2026 Nike\u2019s women\u2019s business has underperformed relative to its men\u2019s division, and Lululemon has taken a significant lead in the female activewear market. This partnership gives Nike instant access to Skims\u2019 powerful audience of millennial and Gen Z women. On the surface, it makes sense. But does Nike need Skims to win in this space? Or does the very existence of this partnership signal that Nike lacks the internal resources to do this themselves? What This Partnership Means for Both Brands What Nike Gets What Skims Gets The biggest winner here? Skims. Skims is not an activewear brand\u2014it\u2019s a shapewear, loungewear, and underwear company. This partnership allows them to pivot into sportswear overnight. Meanwhile, Nike\u2014the undisputed sportswear leader\u2014now borrows cultural capital from Skims. That\u2019s the contradiction: Nike should be the one making Skims credible, not the other way around. A Contradiction in Values: What Message Does This Send? Nike has spent decades positioning itself as a brand that champions athleticism, empowerment, and performance. Its biggest female athletes\u2014Serena Williams, Megan Rapinoe, and Simone Biles\u2014have helped define what Nike stands for. Now, Nike is partnering with Kim Kardashian\u2014a business mogul, yes, but one whose brand is rooted in aesthetics, body sculpting, and influencer culture. Nike\u2019s press release states this collaboration is about making women feel \u201cstrong and sexy.\u201d But ask yourself this: Nike\u2019s greatest risk isn\u2019t irrelevance\u2014it\u2019s blindness. If the next generation of female athletes sees Nike more focused on aesthetics than athleticism, they may start looking elsewhere. Is This a New Direction for Nike\u2014or Just a Quick Win? Here\u2019s the real test: Will Nike use this partnership to truly innovate in women\u2019s activewear, or will it be just another collaboration that fizzles out once the hype dies down? We\u2019ve seen this before: Nike\u2019s $6B market cap surge on the Skims announcement is exciting. But stock bumps don\u2019t build brands\u2014vision does. The big question: Is this move part of a bigger strategic plan, or just a financial sugar high? Nike\u2019s Alpha Status is Now Its Biggest Risk This is new territory for Nike. Everyone who knew what it was like to fight for the top spot is long gone. When you\u2019ve been the alpha for this long, eventually, you stop looking over your shoulder. Malcolm Gladwell said it best: \u201cWhy do giants lose? Because they can\u2019t see. When they become big and powerful, they lose the ability to appreciate the world around them.\u201d That\u2019s the risk Nike faces today. It\u2019s not seeing the shifts happening in real time\u2014it\u2019s reacting to them after the fact. Nike isn\u2019t leading culture anymore\u2014it\u2019s chasing it. And when you start playing defense instead of offense, you start losing ground. The question is: Does Nike still have the hunger to fight like a challenger? Or has it become too comfortable being Goliath? What Nike Should Be Doing Instead If Nike truly wants to reclaim its leadership position, here\u2019s what it should focus on: 1. Prioritize Innovation Over Borrowed Influence Nike needs to stop relying on collabs and start creating products that change the game again. Where\u2019s the next Air Max? The next Flyknit? 2. Fix the Women\u2019s Business at the Product Level Marketing is great, but women don\u2019t just want resized men\u2019s shoes.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Business Insider Edition  When June came around last year, Sarah Wong was at the end of her rope. As a social media marketer, much of her day is spent on the phone keeping up with local news and events, and she'd hit a breaking point. \"It's just very overwhelming to be bombarded with news every day,\" the 28-year-old tells me.          Wong and her husband, a software engineer, typically travel every couple of months from their hometown of Austin, spending a few days exploring cities like Las Vegas, San Diego, and Martha's Vineyard. But her regular vacation wasn't going to cut it this time. Wong decided to try a wellness retreat, hoping it would help her unplug and reset her nervous system. She booked a four-night stay at the nearby Miraval Austin Resort and Spa with her husband. \"I think anyone who works in social media needs a reset where they don't have to be online,\" she says.               At the property, staff valeted her minivan and took her bags. Wong and her husband were given the choice between a backpack or tote bag containing a brandedwater bottle and a \"cellphone sleeping bag\" to hold their phones during their stay. (Miraval enforces a strict no-phone policy except in designated areas). \"It's very 'White Lotus',\" she tells me.               Between rope courses, sound bowl healing, and yoga, she and her husband would snag lunch from the build-your-own salad bar or off a menu where \"each dish is designed with wellness in mind,\" per the resort, and lounge by the pool. She tried yoga nidra, a form of meditation that promotes relaxation, which she describes as feeling like \"you woke up from the best nap of your life.\"               \"It feels like an adult summer camp,\" she says.               Since the retreat, Wong says she is able to step away from her phone more easily and spends more time outside. \"I've been trying to use our patio to just take in the fresh air, look at trees, look at the sky.\" She and her husband are planning to go again this year. \"We want to hit all three properties,\" she tells me.               Ever since pandemic-era travel restrictions subsided, travel has boomed. More recently, \"rest and relaxation\" has jumped ahead of having \"a fun time\" as the main motivation for leisure travel, according to a nationally representative 2024 survey of 1,000 US travelers from the market research firm Longwoods International. A Deloitte survey produced similar results. More people are feeling overwhelmed, burned out, or just want to focus their PTO time on improving their health. A 2023 American Express travel survey found that 73% of respondents were planning vacations around improving their physical and emotional health, with millennials and Gen Z prioritizing wellness travel at a higher rate than older generations.               A growing obsession with wellness paired with mounting uncertainty about daily life is driving demand for relaxation. Welcome to the age of the self-care-cation.               As recently as five years ago, wellness could be classified as a \"niche segment\" in travel, associated primarily with weekend spa breaks and hippie yoga retreats. But since COVID, people have begun to get serious about their health. McKinsey estimated the US market for wellness \u2014 which it defined as including better health, fitness, sleep, mindfulness, appearance, and nutrition \u2014 is up almost 7% since 2022, reaching $480 billion. Nearly 60% of respondents to the McKinsey survey said they valued wellness more in 2024 than the previous year. Meanwhile, the number of health and wellness podcasts has grown by 50% in the past five years, Nielsen found, while self-help books are one of the fastest-growing nonfiction genres. Younger generations are now shunning alcohol and driving a boom in bougie wellness clubs.               \"The tourism market looks a little bit at what's happening in people's leisure time, looks at the consumer trends and thinks, 'How can we capitalize on this?'\" says Melanie Kay Smith, an associate professor of tourism management at Budapest Business University.               Hilton announced in January that it now offers guided meditations, sleep stories, and mindfulness exercises from the mental-health wellness company Calm via their hotel room TVs. It also partnered with Peloton to offer workouts from room TVs. Other brands are investing in new wellness-focused resorts, such as Hyatt's new \"art and wellness house\" in Panama that's set to open soon. Accor Group plans to open 18 new luxury hotels this year and touts the wellness amenities in five of them. It's also opening a wellness-focused resort in the Caribbean later this year.               The drive for wellness isn't coming out of nowhere. In 2023, nearly half of Americans reported they frequently experienced stress, more than any other point since Gallup started tracking it in 1994. People are also becoming more anxious: In 2024, 43% of adults surveyed by the American Psychiatric Association said they felt more anxious than they had the previous year. \"As life speeds up, maybe our vacations need to be slower to compensate,\" says Smith.               Hotels, resorts, and retreats are stepping in to meet the need for a little TLC. In 2024, Miraval Resorts said it saw a nearly 80% increase in demand for stress management workshops over the previous year. It also said that group arrivals have increased 157% since 2021. \"I think the luxury consumer realizes that instead of acquiring things, acquiring experiences is much more rich,\" says Dina Niekamp, the associate vice president of sales, marketing, and brand for Miraval.               Ella Dixon-Nuttall, a 28-year-old yoga teacher from London, was tired of taking trips that revolved around beach clubs and drinking. So last June, she went on her first yoga retreat in Sicily with a friend. It cost 1,600, or just over $2,000, for the week and included accommodations, three meals a day, and yoga classes in the morning and evening. \"You got the benefit of an all-inclusive but then you also have the movement and wellness aspect,\" she tells me. \"I get home and feel filled up and energized by the experience rather than needing another holiday to get over the holiday.\"               Dixon-Nuttall enjoyed it so much that in February she went on her second retreat, this time with her mother. In March, she went on a third retreat in France. \"It's such a wonderful way to travel,\" she says. \"I'm now a retreat convert to the point where if I want to go somewhere I'll look if there's a retreat there.\" She is looking to book another in India later this year.               Lili Paxton's mother is a similar convert. Growing up, Paxton recalls family ski trips and girls getaways to Palm Springs. But at the end of 2022, Paxton and her mother were looking to book a more relaxing trip. They ended up planning a weeklong stay at Rancho La Puerta, a wellness resort and spa just over the San Diego border in Baja California, Mexico, after a family member recommended it. Weeklong rates for one person start at $5,650. Neither Paxton nor her mother had done anything like it before.               Each day hikes were offered at 5:30 a.m. Classes were available each hour for everything from Pilates to pickleball. Paxton's mother tried Watsu \u2014 a type of water therapy that uses massage, stretching, and acupressure \u2014 for the first time. \"She said it was the most spiritual experience,\" Paxton says. \"She said that she saw my dead father under the water.\"               When Paxton wasn't hiking or exercising, she was at the spa or relaxing by the pool. \"The whole time I was just really happy,\" she says. \"It felt like an escape from reality.\"               Her mother left the trip transformed. \"My mom is committed to going every year until she dies,\" says Paxton. \"She even talked to her financial planner and was like, 'I need you to put this in the budget for the next 20 years.'\" They spent another week at the retreat this past Christmas.               While many people are happy to pay a premium for a chance to indulge in simple things like walking in nature or taking a deep breath, for others, wellness is becoming increasingly high-tech. Since 2008, the wellness resort Sha has been at the forefront of holistic health, offering around 1,000 different treatments in nearly 40 different medical and health specialties at its locations in Spain and Mexico. Stays at the resort start at 550 euros a night, or roughly $600, while specialized four-day programs start at 2,500 euros, or about $2,700, with add-ons for treatments focused on sexual well-being, sleep recovery, stress management, gut health, quitting smoking, and more.               The \"Leader's Performance\" program, for example, starts with an advanced preventive diagnosis that tests body composition, cognitive abilities, and advanced glycation end-product accumulation \u2014 compounds that are linked with aging. Guests can also participate in clinical analyses, such as an oxidative stress test and a tailored meal plan with nutritional monitoring.               Almost every type of treatment imaginable is available at Sha: stem cell treatment, advanced plasma renewal, hormone replacement therapy, sleep diagnosis. All guests receive an alkalizing diet tailored to their individual nutritional needs. \"Even if you go to see all these different experts in the city, first, it will take you months to see them all, then there will be no coordination between them,\" Alejandro Bataller, Sha's vice president, says. \"We're probably the most comprehensive.\"               While Sha appeals to a range of health-conscious consumers, Bataller has noticed an increase over the past two or three years in customers he calls \"biohackers.\" These are people who already have a longevity doctor, nutritionist, and functional medicine doctor on speed dial, who take 40-plus supplements a day and invest in the latest high-tech treatments. \"They don't want a standard program,\" he says. \"They come to Sha because they know that Sha is always cutting edge.\"               Bataller describes wellness as not just being healthy, but as an \"active, ongoing pursuit\" that focuses on improving yourself. \"You can see someone with the best car, the best watch, the best suit,\" he says. \"But if he doesn't look healthy, that doesn't seem like luxury.\"               While there's research backing up some of these treatments, Jessica DeFino, a beauty reporter and culture critic, questions how much is driven by health and how much is simply a medicalized beauty standard. \"A better way to think about how we see looking healthy today is actually looking wealthy,\" she says. \"It's looking as if you've funneled thousands and tens of thousands of dollars into your face and body. That's not health; that's products, that's procedures.\"               Of course, products and procedures are all the rage right now as people look for alternative approaches to well-being. \"Our culture is largely unwell,\" DeFino explains. Only 36% of Americans have at least \"quite a lot\" of trust in the medical system, a 2024 Gallup survey found, and studies show that Americans are sicker than people in many parts of the world. Only about half of Americans focus on eating healthy and exercising, despite diet and physical inactivity being leading contributors to chronic disease. Wellness gurus have stepped in to fill the gap left by a flagging healthcare system. Across social platforms, they document macros consumed and hours spent in REM, while touting the benefits of cryotherapy, red-light therapy, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. \"The draw of wellness for the average person is it offers an individualized solution to a collective issue,\" DeFino says, adding: \"A lot of this is an attempt to intellectualize these arbitrary, oppressive beauty standards and make them seem like smart investments.\"               That doesn't mean the pursuit of chilling out isn't worth it. A 2023 study that reviewed 68 articles from 2002 to 2022 found that wellness tourism \u2014 defined as any tourism activities pursued with the goal of maintaining or improving health \u2014 could offer both psychological and quality-of-life benefits. However, these benefits vary from person to person, making it challenging to measure them.               It's easy to get carried away thinking we all need cutting-edge treatments to get by. \"It's great to step out of your everyday life and relax,\" says DeFino. \"Collectively, we also have to be focusing on how we create lives that we don't need to step out of all of the time.\"       Eve Upton-Clark is a features writer covering culture and society.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"What will it take for India's private companies to begin investing in building new factories and firms? It's a question that's confounded policymakers for years. As a share of gross domestic product (GDP), private investment in India has been on the decline since the global financial crisis of 2007, even while the overall economy clocked world-beating growth rates. After a long hiatus, the investment rate picked up slightly in 2022 and 2023, but latest data from a leading ratings agency shows private sector expenditure as part of the overall investments in India's economy dipped again to a decadal low of 33% this financial year. Analysis from Icra of 4,500 listed companies and 8,000 unlisted companies reveals that while the pace of investments made by listed players moderated, those by unlisted entities actually contracted. Over the years, several economists have raised similar concerns about a slowdown in private investments.  Banking tycoon Uday Kotak is among many who've raised concerns recently about India's fading \"animal spirits\", urging young business owners who had inherited companies to build new businesses rather than sitting tight and managing their existing wealth. Data from investment advisory firm Value Research shows Indian non-financial businesses were sitting on cash worth 11% of their total assets, corroborating the view that companies are not spending money in making fresh investments.  So why are Indian corporate houses choosing to do that? Weak domestic consumption in urban areas, muted export demand and an influx of cheap Chinese imports in some sectors were among the factors that \"restricted the capacity expansion plans of Indian corporate houses\", Icra's Chief Rating Officer K Ravichandran said in a note. But beyond the more immediate reasons, private investment impulse has been low because of \"global uncertainties and overcapacity\", India's economic survey pointed out earlier this year. Slowing private investments have a direct bearing on India's growth prospects. Investments by companies in assets such as factories, machinery or construction \u2013 also called gross fixed capital formation \u2013 make up around 30% of GDP and are its second largest contributor following private consumption. India's full-year GDP is expected to close at 6.5%, sharply lower compared to last year's 9.2%. Growth has flagged on account of slower consumption. With all the key levers of growth, including exports, slowing down and US President Donald Trump's tariffs exacerbating global uncertainties, kick-starting private investment will be fundamental for India to hit its long-term growth targets, experts say. According to the World Bank's latest estimates, India will need to grow by 7.8% on average over the next 22 years to achieve its high-income status ambition by 2047. Key to this would be to increase private and public investment to at least 40% of GDP from 33% currently, the bank estimates. The government on its part has significantly increased spending, especially on infrastructure. It also cut corporate tax rates from 30% to 22% and doled out billions of dollars in production-linked subsidies to manufacturers over the years. Availability of bank credit isn't a constraint any longer, and regulation has eased with regulatory restrictions halving between 2003 and 2020. But none of this has prodded corporate India to boost spending. According to Sajjid Chinoy, JP Morgan India's Chief Economist, the big problem is the lack of demand in the economy to justify putting up additional capacities. India's post-pandemic recovery has been uneven, with the consumer class not expanding quickly enough. Demand for goods and services has thus been hit, with spending capacity further curtailed by a fall in wages, even though corporate profitability has soared to a 15-year high this year. \"Just because companies are financially strong doesn't mean they will automatically invest. Companies will only invest if they expect good returns,\" Chinoy said at an event in Mumbai earlier this year. Rathin Roy, a former member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC), points to other deeper structural issues arresting investment appetite. \"Entrepreneurs have been lacking the energy to produce goods that might generate new demand. A classic example of this is construction - where there's unsold inventory in the urban areas, but an incapacity among builders to go into tier two and tier three towns and tap newer markets,\" Roy told the BBC. He said he also agreed with Mr Kotak's views on the growing trend of business heirs turning wealth managers rather than building businesses ground up. \"Business houses discovered during Covid-19 that they don't need to do business to make money. They can just invest and multiply it without building anything new,\" said Roy. And these investments aren't just happening in the domestic stock market. \"A lot of money is just flowing out of India and chasing returns elsewhere,\" he added. But things could be turning a corner, according to Icra. Interest rate cuts as well as a $12bn income tax relief provided to individuals in the federal budget \"augurs well for supporting domestic consumption demand\", according to the report. India's central bank also says more private companies have shown an intention to invest this year compared to last year, although how much of that intent results into actual money deployed remains to be seen.  The uncertainties related to global trade tariffs could delay any anticipated investment pick-up, according to Icra. Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Business Insider Edition  The Trump administration and its allies have ramped up the pressure ahead of a planned protest on March 29 that aims to target 500 Tesla showrooms worldwide.  The Tesla Takedown movement is protesting Elon Musk's involvement with the White House DOGE office, which has been a lightning rod of criticism over concerns about privacy and potential disruption to public services.               Alice Hu, one of the leaders of Tesla Takedown, based in New York City, said she faced doxxing and threats following a March 19 online call about the coming protests.               Hu, who is a US-born American citizen, told Business Insider that many of those threats occurred after Laura Loomer, a right-wing social media influencer with more than 1.5 million followers on X, posted that Hu \"is Chinese.\"               The Tesla Takedown movement has focused on peaceful protests at Tesla showrooms, as was repeatedly emphasized by Hu and other organizers, who don't want their movement to be conflated with sporadic acts of vandalism and arson against Tesla cars and showrooms.               Prosecutors in Colorado charged a woman last month in connection to an attack on a Tesla dealership, and authorities arrested a man in South Carolina whom they said set fire to Tesla charging stations. There is so far no evidence that these individual acts are connected to organizers of Tesla Takedown.               \"It is a reality that there could be escalation from the police and counter-protestors trying to provoke violence, and we are trying to educate each other on how to de-escalate situations,\" said Hu. \"The only thing we can control is our own conduct.\"               President Donald Trump has suggested that acts of vandalism against Tesla are \"domestic terrorism.\" FBI director Kash Patel created a task force to investigate apparent attacks against Tesla showrooms and cars and wrote in a tweet that \"those responsible will be pursued, caught, and brought to justice.\"               Trump also suggested via a social media post that those found guilty of participating in Tesla-related crimes be sent to prisons in El Salvador. Musk accused a protest organizer in Seattle of \"committing crimes\" without evidence.               During an interview on Fox News's Hannity, Attorney General Pam Bondi also demanded that Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, who called for protests against Musk on March 29, apologize to Tesla shareholders for \"promoting violence.\"               Meanwhile, the administration is also propping up Tesla and Musk, who serves as a White House advisor.               Trump showcased Teslas in front of the White House and said he would gift his granddaughter a Cybertruck, while Secretary of CommerceHoward Lutnick urged people to buy Tesla stock during an interview on Fox News.               As of this week, Tesla's shares plunged nearly 40% compared to their peak in December 2024. Given Musk's time commitment to DOGE, investors are concerned about the CEO's commitment to Tesla. The company's sales have plummeted in\u00a0Europe\u00a0and\u00a0China, and Cybertrucks just faced a fresh round of recalls.               Sarah Ludington, director of the First Amendment Clinic at the Duke School of Law, told Business Insider that although the government is by law entitled to investigate organizations suspected of crimes, and separate from that, voice its opposition to certain points of view, Musk's ability to potentially influence government decisions does complicate the situation.               \"People from the private sector who go into government sort of divorce themselves of their private sector ties when they accept a high-level government position, like putting their investments in a blind trust,\" said Ludington, \"but now we have somebody highly placed in the government who can potentially influence the executive to crack down on certain points of view.\"               Additionally, Ludington said there are reasons to be concerned for undocumented and non-citizen protesters who could be targeted by immigration enforcement. This is a concern that Hu shares.               \"I am a US-born American citizen, but regardless of citizenship status, it's very concerning to me and many other Americans, what is happening to non-citizen protesters,\" she said, referring to recent incidents where pro-Palestinian student protesters have been targeted by immigration enforcement and could face deportation.               However, the comments from the administration and others have only strengthened Hu's resolve.               \"These protests are not stopping just because people like Elon Musk are trying to harass and intimidate protesters,\" said organizer Alice Hu, \"I feel like this is motivating me more because the peaceful protests we are organizing are working.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Business Insider Edition  We went with the best intentions; that's what we tell ourselves now.          In 2012, my husband and I made the sensible decision to move from Chicago to Seattle so he could design Microsoft's line of phones and tablets.               The job came with an eye-watering salary bump, a bonus, and stock options we had seen only in the movies.               Both of us had moved to Chicago soon after graduating from college. We loved the city and didn't want to leave, but we questioned whether an offer like this would ever come again.       \"We'll move back if we hate it,\" we promised ourselves. We spent the next 12 years breaking that promise.               We found early on that people seemed to keep to themselves and weren't looking for new friends.               Still, there were some bright spots as the years ticked by. We had financial security for the first time in our lives, a few friends (all transplants like us), and a Craftsman house we spent weekends remodeling.               I got pregnant three months after moving and lost the baby at 20 weeks. Three miscarriages followed, along with a fight for doctors to find the root cause.               Our son, Leo, was born healthy in 2015, but a childbirth injury disabled me for five years and nearly cost me a leg. The hits kept coming as steadily as Seattle's drizzling rain.               Five years stretched into eight, and I had long given up forming an attachment to our new city under the pressure of first-time parenthood, medical trauma, and Seattle's air of social isolation. Most days, I could barely get out of bed.               It was about this time when my husband and I began fantasizing about moving back to Chicago. The world was still in the throes of COVID lockdown, but what if it weren't? Where would we be today, we wondered, if we still lived there?               We romanticized Cubs games, the gritty \"El\" train, and even our first apartment that blew a fuse every time we plugged in the toaster. Living in Chicago was objectively harder, but our lives were fuller back then.               We weren't confined to hours spent in gridlock traffic or constrained conversations that seemed to revolve around the same five topics: health problems, renovations, money, apathy, and \u2014 poignantly \u2014 when life would feel good again. We didn't sit at home in front of the TV; we were out, moving, doing new things.               Our son had never experienced that kind of freedom, and depriving him of it weighed on our minds. We were in \"golden handcuffs,\" chained by a lucrative job to a place we'd rather not be. We had bought into it in the beginning, not yet understanding that we were selling our quality of life.               I had just come home after another unplanned hospital stay. I looked around at the house we had remodeled together: the shiny oak floors laid in painstaking rows, the tile and countertops that perfectly matched the hand-carved crown molding.               It had all been a distraction, a consolation prize for the years we'd spent trying to make it work. I wanted to burn it all down. I cried on the bathroom floor instead.               \"I don't think I can live here anymore,\" I choked out between sobs. My husband sat down and put his arm around me. The hollowness of our life in Seattle had finally become too much, and without saying it, he understood that success on paper was no longer enough.               \"OK,\" he said. \"Let's go.\"               We were a less glamorous Joan Didion and John Dunne, barreling down I-90 with a third grader and a cat searching for a different life.               My husband landed a lead engineer role in Chicago's West Loop, our old stomping grounds, which has replaced dive bars and fish markets with five-star restaurants and art galleries.               In July, we bought a 115-year-old house in Evanston within walking distance of the train, restaurants, shops, an art center, and a comic book store where my son spends all his allowance.               Our garden gate opens to a community park where the kids play baseball all summer and ice-skate all winter. I started writing again for the first time in years, and I run our backyard Airbnb dedicated to John Hughes, who filmed his movies nearby.               The neighbors added us to the group chat and delivered welcome gifts to our front porch. \"I'd forgotten what this was like,\" Dave said as we unloaded boxes.               \"What?\" I asked.               \"Feeling at home,\" he said.               On our first Saturday back in town, we walked to a diner on Central Street near our house. A group of boys about my son's age rushed in in baseball uniforms, having ditched their unlocked bikes outside. They ordered food and sat in the booth behind us, chatting about their win. My son was enthralled.               \"Where are their parents?\" he whispered, craning his neck to see more of the unsupervised activity.               \"I think they came alone,\" my husband whispered back, smiling at me.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"American buyers of Ferrari\u2019s (RACE) luxury vehicles will soon have to pay higher prices, as the Italian automaker looks to offset the burden of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs. The Trump administration\u2019s new 25% tariffs on all imports of finished cars and trucks and of auto parts are set to go into effect on April 3. Almost half of all vehicles sold in the U.S. are imported, as are almost 60% of all parts in vehicles assembled in the U.S. Ferrari said Thursday that the impact of the tariffs would be partially reflected in its pricing for almost all imports after April 2. Excluding imports of Ferrari 297, SF90, and Roma vehicles, new cars could become as much as 10% more expensive. Some 40% of Ferrari\u2019s global sales come from the U.S. market.  \u201cAnd while Ferrari demand may prove amongst the least elastic to moderate changes in price...Ferrari purchases are arguably amongst the most discretionary also, and so we could envision some buyers electing to delay taking delivery,\u201d JPMorgan (JPM) analysts led by Ryan Brinkman said in a Thursday note.  Analysts at Bernstein (AB) led by Stephen Reitman argued in a Thursday note that U.S. customers won\u2019t be pushed away by higher prices. Ferrari\u2019s customers tend to be wealthier individuals who will be less impacted by tariffs, which put more pressure on poorer consumers.  \u201cWe are hard-pressed to think of any customer cohort in the U.S. that is better placed than Ferrari\u2019s to absorb higher prices,\u201d the Bernstein analysts said. \u201cAny increase in new prices will be somewhat cushioned by the knowledge that the customer\u2019s other Ferraris in their garage have seen their values rise.\u201d JPMorgan lowered its December 2025 price target for Ferrari by 12%, to $460 per share from $525 per share, while Bernstein maintained an outperform rating on the stock. Ferrari stock is up by almost 2% and trades at $421 per share. Ferrari said its financial targets for 2025 will remain unchanged. The company has forecast adjusted earnings of at least 2.68 billion euros ($2.88 billion), an increase of at least 5%, and net revenue of more than 7 billion euros ($7.5 billion) for the full year.  Ferrari recorded net profit of 1.53 billion euros ($1.6 billion) and revenue of 6.7 billion euros ($7.2 billion) in 2024. That\u2019s an increase of 21% and 12%, respectively, compared to 2023.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"It's what makes them elite.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Qualcomm is nearing a big decision. It's reportedly gearing up to release a new, midrange Snapdragon chip. While this \"budget\" SoC is rumored to be powered by Arm cores \u2014 not the custom Oryon cores powering other Elite chips \u2014 it's unclear whether the company will still use \"Elite\" branding. We've seen reports use both Snapdragon 8s Elite and Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 to refer to the unannounced mobile chip. The problem? The custom Oryon CPU cores are what make Snapdragon 8 Elite chips, well, \"elite.\" Let's review how we got here. Last year, Qualcomm finally achieved its breakthrough moment. It launched the Snapdragon X lineup of laptop and desktop-class systems-on-a-chip (SoCs) in June 2024 that would eventually disrupt the stronghold competitors AMD and Intel had on personal computing. Then, Qualcomm used what it learned to develop the Snapdragon X platform and brought it to mobile with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. By now, I've had the chance to review and test multiple Snapdragon X and Snapdragon 8 Elite laptops and phones, respectively. They're both as good as advertised. Snapdragon X brought excellent power efficiency and responsiveness to Windows laptops, and Snapdragon 8 Elite brought massive year-over-year performance improvements to Android smartphones.  Oryon cores are the secret to Qualcomm's major success. The company used its own custom Oryon cores instead of off-the-shelf designs from Arm to make the Snapdragon X, Snapdragon X Plus, and Snapdragon X Elite SoCs. Essentially, it followed the same blueprint Apple used when designing its own silicon. A quick look at Qualcomm's PC processors reveals that chips with Oryon cores don't always use the Elite brand. That's reserved for Qualcomm's best PC chips, while budget versions with slower clock speeds and\/or fewer cores use names like Snapdragon X and Snapdragon X Plus. But we've never seen a Qualcomm chip branded with the Elite tag that doesn't use custom Oryon cores. Although there are conflicting reports about whether the next Snapdragon 8s mobile processor will get a \"Gen 4\" or \"Elite\" brand name, the right option seems clear. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Qualcomm should name the unreleased midrange chip Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 to avoid consumer confusion and keep the Elite brand sacred for the company's standout processors \u2014 those with Oryon cores. Right now, there's no official word on what Qualcomm will call the next Snapdragon 8s chip. One rumor from reputable leaker Yogesh Brar on X (formerly Twitter) earlier this month said that the SoC was \"set to launch soon,\" referring to it as Snapdragon 8s Elite. More recently, a tip from Digital Chat Station this week on Weibo called the unreleased chip the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4. Although both rumored names are only speculation at this point, one seems more fitting than the other.  That's because current leaks claim to reveal the upcoming Snapdragon 8s chip's core structure, and custom Oryon cores are absent. According to Digital Chat Station, this processor has a model number of SN8735. It is said to be headlined by a 3.21GHz Cortex-X4 Prime Core, plus three more 3.01GHz Cortex-A720 cores and two 2.80GHz Cortex-A720 cores. The SoC is also expected to include two 2.02GHz Cortex-A720 efficiency cores. If this configuration turns out to be accurate, the Snapdragon 8s chip will use standard Arm designs rather than Qualcomm's best Oryon cores. This isn't a bad thing, because the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip is expensive, and the \"s\" variant is supposed to be cheaper. However, it does mean that the Elite branding wouldn't exactly make sense for this particular SoC. Qualcomm is a very large company operating in many different verticals, from cellular modems to smartphone and desktop chips. Under those circumstances, it's easy for naming schemes to get convoluted. Just look at what Intel and Sony have done over the years, releasing products like the Intel Core i9 14900K or the Sony WH-1000XM5. Luckily, Qualcomm seems to be aware of how important branding is for consumer clarity. At MWC Barcelona 2025, it introduced a new naming scheme for its vast portfolio of products. Qualcomm will be used for general products, like modems, with the Snapdragon brand serving consumer products and the Dragonwing brand covering the enterprise market.  Qualcomm may be set up for an interesting decision. On the one hand, using the name Snapdragon 8s Elite would make it clear that the to-be-released chip is part of the same generation as the Snapdragon 8 Elite. On the other hand, using the name Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 would make it clear that the chip isn't using custom Oryon cores. Only time will tell which name Qualcomm will end up using. Personally, I'm voting for the next Snapdragon 8s SoC to be called the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4. While the Elite nomenclature is an excellent brand, it's too good to be diluted. Currently, every Elite chip features Qualcomm's custom Oryon cores, and I think it should stay that way.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"Dmitri Sirota, Chief Executive Officer of BigID, spoke with NYSE TV\u2019s \u201cTaking Stock with Kristen Scholer\u201d for a special video interview. Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. KRISTEN SCHOLER (KS): Artificial intelligence remains in the spotlight. HumanX is currently underway in Las Vegas talking all things AI and companies continue to raise money in this space. Well, joining me now with more on how his company is operating in this current environment is Dmitri Sirota. He\u2019s the CEO and co-founder of BigID. BigID recently debuted BigID Next. How is this platform helping companies protect their data? DMITRI SIROTA (DS): Big ID started off as a company focused on helping organizations manage secure govern their data. As we\u2019ve evolved and as AI has become prominent over the last two, three years, we\u2019ve extended that to actually managing models, copilots, agents, and so BigID Next provides a vehicle for organizations to manage their data, the data that they use to train these AI models, but also to train the models to manage the models themselves to make sure they\u2019re properly governed, properly controlled, and they don\u2019t abuse or misuse the data that goes into train them. KS: Safeguarding and protecting AI by protecting the data. How crucial is that? DS: So we do a little bit of both. We actually protect the models and the interactions with the models, employees, consumers, but also the data. So 99% of companies are not gonna be building frontier or foundation models like OpenAI. What they\u2019re gonna be doing is training existing models like OpenAI, like Claude or Anthropic on their data. So they\u2019re gonna make the models smart on their data, but they want to be careful about how that data gets used and about how the models basically regurgitate that data back to employees and consumers. So we help on both accounts. We help them manage what data they feel comfortable using, make sure it\u2019s properly cleansed, it\u2019s compliant with all the regulations, it doesn\u2019t violate any internal policies. And at the same time, we wanna manage the interactions with the models. We wanna make sure the models don\u2019t go rogue, the models don\u2019t send back information that is private or privileged. So BigID Next helps with both. KS: How does this help companies stay ahead in an uber-competitive environment? DS: It facilitates them being able to use AI safely. I think today we\u2019re now kind of three years in since Open AI debuted ChatGPT. I think every company realizes and every board of director realizes their future hinges on the successful adoption of AI. There\u2019s efficiency benefits, their scale benefits, and this is before we hit AIG. However, training those models, making use of those models, how they allow those models to be used by employees and by consumers and partners, that is still to be defined. So if we\u2019re able to safeguard that, if we\u2019re able to give them guardrails and parameters, then they could take advantage of AI more safely. KS: Can you quantify the positive impact this can have? DS: We can. I think we allow them to train and develop more models. We actually do give them an ability to assess the risk of an AI program that combines a model and the data that goes into them. We let them prioritize so they could focus on the ones that fall within a CT parameter of risk that they are willing to take. And ultimately if we\u2019re able to help them deliver more, more, more models, more agents, more co-pilots and drive more value to their employees and to their customers, then we we see benefit. KS: What more can you tell me about the key differentiators when it comes to BigID Next? DS: Differentiators are a few things. So first of all, we have visibility into data. We could find it, we can identify it, we could contextualize it, meaning we could tell you if there\u2019s other versions of that data where it exists. And BigID Next has the broadest coverage in terms of where companies keep data, whether it\u2019s in SAP (SAP), whether it\u2019s in Salesforce (CRM), whether it\u2019s in Azure (MSFT), GCP (GOOGL) or AWS (AMZN) or even in in Legacy data center. On top of that, it has the ability to control. It doesn\u2019t just tell you about the data. It gives you an ability to control the data. And with BigID Next, we don\u2019t just limit you to the data, we now give you an ability to control the models and how the models interact, both with the data and the consumers that are using the models. KS: What more can you share in terms of why companies do need to adapt this now? DS: So look, AI is obviously gonna be decades long, the most salient kind of change, just like mobile was just like cloud was just like the internet commerce was maybe 15, 16 years ago. AI is gonna be the prevalent arc that we all need to kind of abide by. And I think companies that are sitting on the sidelines and can\u2019t take advantage of it because of concerns around security, compliance, privacy, are gonna be at a disadvantage. And so we\u2019re gonna help those organizations that are regulated or that are subject to some of the privacy regulations or that just want to have better experiences for their customers or their employees. We\u2019re gonna help them take advantage of the latest technology, but do it in a responsible and safe way. KS: What are your goals for 2025? DS: So the goals are obviously to deal with  any negative repercussions in the economy. But, more importantly, I think we\u2019ve seen robust growth over the last three, four years despite softness in the economy. And now with AI becoming as prevalent as it is, becoming kind of the topic that every board and every CEO is conversing, to really drive that value. Some of the companies listed on the exchange are our customers and I think the more we could showcase around how AI could be used safely, responsibly, how it could be opened up to their employees and to their customers, I think it\u2019s a win-win. It\u2019s a win for us. It\u2019s a win for our customers. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning. ","label":0}

An NPR team traveled this winter through the regions closest to the fighting, where people spoke of hope and loss. Calling out remembered lines of poetry from her twin bed for her daughter to write down is one way that Neonila Prytsyk, 73, tries to recover some of what she has lost in the war.                  Neonila Prytsyk sits in her bed in a temporary housing unit in Posad-Pokrovske, on the land where her home stood before it was destroyed. \"We had everything. I won't be shy to state that I was a good homeowner. I had everything. From a spoon and a cup, to plates and gifts,\" she remembers. She had to prioritize taking her wheelchair and walker when she evacuated because she is disabled after a stroke eight years ago.                                           Claire Harbage\/NPR                                       hide caption  She and her daughter, Larisa Prytsyk, 49, are staying in a tiny temporary housing unit in Posad-Pokrovske, a village in the Kherson region where she's lived since 1984. Her home was severely damaged along with nearly every other in the village because it was in the path of the Russian troops who advanced toward Mykolaiv city in March 2022. \"The hole you've seen there, this was our house. 120 square meters [about 1,300 square feet]. Really beautiful house. Really warm,\" says Neonila. \"Marriage, christenings, funerals,\" she continues. Her loved ones are buried in the town cemetery. \"I've buried my mother. And I buried my husband here,\" she says. \"We had happiness here, and sadness. We had tears here. I was singing here \u2026 I was writing my poetry here.\"  She lost everything \u2014 hand-embroidered heirlooms from her mother, the family of cats she was taking care of, and a life's worth of poetry she had written down in notebooks.                  Despite repair efforts beginning, many homes in Posad-Pokrovske, like this one, remain crumbling shells.                                                           Claire Harbage\/NPR                                       hide caption  Now as an occasional line of lost poetry surfaces in her memory, she is in a rush to not let it slip away. She has her daughter jot them down in a new notebook and then post them to her social media. Larisa Sokolova, 52, the deputy mayor of the village, says not everyone is ready to come back. \"There are many people who are still afraid and who are still not sure about at that stage that we are in this war. Like some people want to see the definitive victory probably to come back. A lot of them, having families and they hear those explosions, they're terrified to return.\"                  Larisa Prytsyk stands on the lot where the home she shared with her aging mother once stood. The remains have been cleared in preparation for a new house to be built. Mother and daughter returned to their village last November, more than two years after they'd evacuated. By then Russian forces had been pushed back for some time \u2014 but front line activity can still be heard less than 30 miles away.

Some buildings are patched with blue tarps and fresh mortar, new foundations are emerging from the ground and a slew of temporary units speckle the village grounds. Across the front line regions, the destruction of buildings, homes, schools and commercial spaces is one of the major costs of the war. Over 2 million homes have been destroyed, according to the United Nations, and it has transformed the landscape of Ukraine.

Some projects have had more immediate success than others. People in the village are concerned about the future of foreign aid and the possibility of corruption causing problems for their funding. But despite the challenges, there is hope. A nearby village, Zelenyi Hai, was also in the path of the Russian advances, but much of it has been restored. Oksana Hnedko, 50, the village head, says she has to remind people not to brag about their successes, \"When our people go to the market to trade, I tell them, 'stop showing off there. Be quiet. Don't show off,' \" she says, laughing.                  Nadia Huscha, 37, (left) and her daughter Anna, 14, talk with Oksana Hnedko in their home that was repaired in Zelenyi Hai. With most of the town's buildings already fixed, Hnedko and Huscha can actually dream of a return to normal. They reminisce about the annual village celebration, the last of which they had in 2021. And they talk about their hopes of having another celebration again someday.

With her family home only four hours' drive away, she holds on to the idea that she could return one day. \"I imagined how I'm gonna come to see my parents, how I'm gonna cry 'cause I haven't seen them for three years. What a hysteria it's gonna be. To see them all. You always imagine something.\" She says she's ready even to walk there.

She is only using her first name because her family is still in occupied territory and she fears Russian authorities might punish them for her work helping displaced people escape such territory. Her brother was three years old when she left her home in Kherson city to visit her boyfriend in Zaporizhzhia in February 2022. The war started while she was away, and now she can't go back. Most of her family members are living in Kherson city. \"There is hope. As we say, hope dies last,\" she says. \"But if I think that potentially I won't be able to go back ever. Obviously it really hurts. Hurts badly. Realizing that you won't see your mother \u2026\"  Anastasia can't keep the tears out of her eyes as she speaks. She's missed half of her brother's life.                  Internally displaced people staying at the ARTAK shelter in Zaporizhzhia gather for dinner. Anastasia found a sense of community by volunteering at ARTAK, where she helps other displaced people, including seniors and the disabled. It's like family, she says.

Halyna Zayceva wanted to stay in Novohrodivka, her home, in the Donetsk region, as long as possible. Other residents of her apartment building had left their keys with her, knowing her intention to stay, and she still has them all. But six months ago, her apartment was struck by a missile while she was out caring for a friend. Now, her home is occupied and she says there's nothing to go back to anyway. \"I would gladly come back, but I doubt that anyone will be able to rebuild it. I always have this hope. But the city is destroyed, destroyed,\" Zayceva says.

All over the front line regions, the sense of uncertainty is apparent. In the Kharkiv region, where people have always been neighbors with Russia, some farmers say they can never return to how things were in the past, no matter what kind of agreement is reached to end the war.

Konstyantyn says this used to be their small slice of Switzerland, with pine forests on one side, oak on the other, and a small pond in the valley. He would go there sometimes just to relax and have a moment of peace.                  A sunflower stands in a field in Staryi Saltiv. The Hordienkos can no longer grow sunflowers in their field due to the ongoing front line activity. Viktor was given the land by the Ukrainian government in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union. He'd been farming his crops ever since, exporting wheat and sunflower products. He imagined one day passing the land on to his son.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"ByDavid Trainer  ByDavid Trainer,  Contributor.  A Skechers sign is shown in San Francisco, Sunday, March 17, 2024. (AP Photo\/Jeff Chiu) I originally made Skechers USA, Inc. (SKX) a Long Idea in May 2018 and have reiterated my bullish view on the stock many times. Since my last update, SKX has outperformed as a Long Idea, but most recently, shares plummeted after reporting 4Q24 earnings. This drop begs the question, does Skechers still provide quality risk\/reward? As I\u2019ll show below, the answer is yes. Skechers has grown revenue by 14% and net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) by 15% compounded annually since 2014. See Figure 1. The company improved its NOPAT margin from 8.1% in 2014 to 8.9% in 2024 while invested capital turns increased from 1.4 to 1.6 over the same time. Rising operational and capital efficiency drive return on invested capital (ROIC) from 11% in 2014 to 14% in 2024. Additionally, the company\u2019s Core Earnings rose 17% compounded annually from $141 million in 2014 to $654 million in 2024. Figure 1: Skechers\u2019 Revenue and NOPAT Since 2014 SKX NOPAT & Revenue 2014-2024 Skechers\u2019 business operates through two main segments, wholesale and direct-to-consumer, both of which improved in 2024. The company\u2019s direct-to-consumer segment boasts a large network of physical stores across the world. At the end of 2024, Skechers owned ~1,800 retail stores worldwide while distributors, licensees, and franchisees operated another ~3,500 stores, which brings Skechers\u2019 total retail locations to ~5,300. For reference, footwear giant Nike (NKE) operates a retail store count of just over 1,000. With a larger store footprint compared to its most well-known peer, Skechers leverages locations to allow more consumers to experience their footwear in person. In 2024, Skechers grew its direct-to-consumer sales 11% YoY, from $3.5 billion in 2023 to $3.9 billion in 2024. On the other hand, Skechers\u2019 wholesale sales, which include stores operated by third parties (licensees, franchisees such as sporting goods retailers, department stores, and more), grew 13% YoY, from $4.5 billion in 2023 to $5.1 billion in 2024. Combined, Skecher\u2019s total sales grew 12% YoY in 2024 and reached a company record $9.0 billion. Although Skechers is, in its own words, \u201cthe third largest footwear company in the world\u201d, it maintains double digit revenue growth rates, a feat that is not always the case as consumer goods companies grow larger. More importantly, the company has grown revenue faster than the overall market, thereby taking market share in the process. Per Figure 2, Skechers\u2019 market share of U.S. clothing and footwear expenditures rose from 0.41% in 2014 to 0.65% in 2024. Figure 2: Skechers\u2019 Market Share of Clothing and Footwear Expenditures: 2014 \u2013 2024 SKX Market Share 2014-2024 Skechers currently operates in more than 180 countries, and the company\u2019s international sales accounted for 62% of its total sales in 2024, up from 34% 2014. Since 2014, Skechers\u2019 international sales grew 21% compounded annually. Last year, the company\u2019s international sales grew 12% YoY. Skechers is expanding beyond its traditional lifestyle footwear and into the global sports world, with a focus on international stars rather than only going after those most known in the United States. Skechers Football (soccer) launched with the 2023\/2024 season, when the company signed a lifetime global deal with English national captain and current Bundesliga leading goal scorer Harry Kane. Other ambassadors include Ghana national Mohammed Kudus and La Liga star Isco Alarcon. Additionally, the company entered the second largest sport in the world, Cricket. Skechers launched Skechers Cricket in 2024, when it signed Mumbai Indian cricketers Ishan Kishan and Yastika Bhatia. In April 2024, Skechers signed the 2022-2023 season NBA MVP Joel Embiid to a multi-year sneaker deal, making him the face of the company\u2019s basketball division. Other ambassadors include three-time NBA All-Star Julius Randle. Skechers management believes sports ambassadors enhance brand awareness and drive consumer demand. Importantly, Skechers is expanding its efforts on the global stage, which will support further international sales growth. Skechers has built a strong brand name in the footwear industry. In fact, Skechers is the leading footwear brand when it comes to customer satisfaction. According to the American Customer Satisfaction Index, Skechers tied for the highest score, an 85, among athletic shoes companies in 2024. Figure 3: Satisfaction Benchmarks by Athletic Shoes Companies: 2023 \u2013 2024 SKX Satisfaction Vs Peers Skechers does not pay a dividend, but it does return capital to shareholders through share repurchases. From 2018 through 2024, the company repurchased $694 million (8% of market cap) of shares. The company repurchased $303 million of shares in 2024 alone. As of December 31, 2024, the company has $790 million of shares available to repurchase under its current authorization. Should the company repurchase shares at its 2024 rate, or $330 million of shares in 2025, the repurchases would represent 3.8% of the current market cap. However, it\u2019s important to note that share repurchases and dividends may not be the best use of capital, as Skechers has a high ROIC and high NOPAT margin business worthy of additional investment. Given that free cash flow (FCF) has been less than repurchases since 2018, I expect the company to lower repurchases in favor of allocating capital to its thriving business. Per Figure 4, Skechers earns an attractive overall Credit Rating and scores an attractive-or-better rating in four of the five credit rating metrics. Even if economic conditions deteriorate or tariffs hurt U.S. businesses more than expected, the company\u2019s strong financial footing secures its operations for the foreseeable future. Figure 4: Skechers\u2019 Credit Rating Details SKX Credit Rating Details Skechers\u2019 stock fell 12% when the company\u2019s 2025 guidance came in below consensus expectations during its 4Q24 earnings call. However, this large drop appears to be an overreaction. The 2025 guidance still implies 9% YoY revenue growth and 11% YoY EPS growth. Additionally, the company remains firm in its expectation to continue its growth and reach $10 billion in revenue in 2026. The stock\u2019s recent drop in price presents a buying opportunity. President Trump\u2019s recent announcement of additional tariffs on China create uncertainty in supply chains for companies operating on an international scale. For instance, Skechers operates a 1.6 million square foot distribution center in China, with ongoing investments to increase its size to 2.3+ million square feet. Luckily for investors, Skechers\u2019 management is prepared for the ongoing tariff uncertainty, largely because they already experienced it in the first Trump administration. First, the company already sells a large portion of its products outside of the U.S., in which case, products made elsewhere can be redirected to those international locales. Additionally, management noted on the 4Q24 earnings call that they\u2019re \u201cgoing to employ the same tactics\u201d as four years ago to \u201cdefend these margins.\u201d Specifically, the company will redirect origin and manufacturing relationships and have conversations with vendors in regard to foreign exchange, where a strengthened dollar helps. Ultimately, the proof is in the financial performance, and Skechers\u2019 management has proven it can effectively manage tariffs. In the pre-COVID years under President Trump\u2019s first administration, when tariffs on China were first implemented, Skechers\u2019 NOPAT margin only rose from 9.2% in 2017 to 9.5% in 2018, and to 9.2% in 2019. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze expectations for different stock price scenarios for SKX. Note: Skechers has grown NOPAT by 15% compounded annually over both the last 10- and 25-year periods. In the first scenario, I quantify the expectations baked into the current price. If I assume: the stock is worth $58\/share today \u2013 nearly equal to the current stock price. For reference, the revenue growth in this scenario would be below consensus expectations of 9.6% in 2025 and 8.7% in 2026. In this scenario, SKX\u2019s NOPAT grows 4% compounded annually from 2025 \u2013 2034, which is well below historical growth rates. If I instead assume: the stock is worth $79\/share today \u2013 a 30% upside to the current price. In this scenario, SKX\u2019s NOPAT would grow 7% compounded annually from 2025 to 2034. Should the company\u2019s NOPAT grow more in line with historical levels, the stock has even more upside. Furthermore, I think companies with long track records of strong profit growth deserve premium stock valuations, especially in a market filled with so many underperforming companies.

Justin Sun Chinese blockchain entrepreneur Justin Sun\u2019s admiration of Donald Trump began in middle school, while he was living in Huizhou, a city in China\u2019s Guangdong province just north of Hong Kong. Sun\u2019s teacher encouraged his class to watch American television to learn vernacular English, so Sun tapped peer-to-peer file sharer BitTorrent, a service that years later he would own, and began downloading reruns of The Apprentice. The precocious Sun says he was captivated by the Ameri\u00adcan tycoon\u2019s lessons in cutthroat competition, showmanship and, of course, ego\u2014anathema in a society steeped in the principles of Confucianism and Chinese socialism. So it felt like fate that Sun heard late last year that the Trump family\u2019s crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, was faltering despite the fact that the patriarch had just been elected president of the United States. It was easy to see why. World Liberty was going to be another decentralized finance plat\u00adform, of which there are hundreds already, but it offered no equity, lacked credible management and its tokens would be illiquid. The fact that the Trumps could have easily self-\u00adfinanced the $30 million needed to launch, but chose against it, underscored why no one else wanted to either. The 34-year-old couldn\u2019t miss the potential dividend sitting in front of him. Since March 2023, Sun has been facing a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit alleging fraudulent market manipulation and selling unregistered securities. Now he had come across a way to single-handedly enrich the person about to lead the executive branch of the U.S. government, the SEC included. In late November, Sun plunked down the $30 million ostensibly needed to cover operating expenses. That $30 million ignited a buying frenzy that primarily benefits the Trump family. As if Sun\u2019s actions weren\u2019t helpful enough, a few weeks later he invested another $45 million into World Liberty Financial, 75% of which went directly into Trump\u2019s pocket.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"With an RPG that claims to be as deep and dynamic as Atomfall, questions about its length are sure to come up. While it isn\u2019t a fully open-world game, you will be exploring giant hubs with little direction from the game on what to investigate or when. Structurally, Atomfall shares a lot of DNA with\u00a0Fallout,\u00a0but those are some of the longest RPGs on the market. If you\u2019re curious how much time you could end up sinking into this title, we\u2019ll break down how long it might take you to see the end. The trouble with estimating how long Atomfall will take is that it is very much up to you as a player. For example, there is an Achievement in the game for beating it in under 5 hours. Accomplishing that almost necessitates prior knowledge, though, but does demonstrate how quickly you could reach the end if you tried. In our experience, we were able to beat the game in a mostly focused playthrough in about 8 hours. That was us mainly ignoring optional quests and other possible paths to an ending and focusing squarely on one. There is also a high degree of variability based on combat and how quickly you can figure out where to go based on the game\u2019s general lack of waypoints guiding you to objectives. A second run, in which we followed more leads and took more time doing side investigations ended up at around 20 hours. That felt like a fulfilling playthrough where we saw everything we were interested in but didn\u2019t look into every nook and cranny. For those who want to fully immerse themselves in this world, follow every investigation, and find every secret, that hour count could go up to 30 or 35 hours. There are a lot of unintuitive systems in\u00a0Monster Hunter Wilds that you need to read a ton of tips and tricks to understand. For example, changing your character's appearance, changing your armor appearance, and editing your character are all different systems. The latter is especially odd since they require a consumable item called Character Edit Vouchers to access. To help you understand what the difference between these are and how you can get these special vouchers, here's a full breakdown of how you can edit your character in Monster Hunter Wilds. How to get and use character edit vouchers Before we get to the bad news regarding Character Edit Vouchers, let's first go over the situations in which you would even need one. You can change a ton about your character by just changing their appearance at your Base Camp, but not everything. The only options that are locked behind the use of a voucher are: Staying alive shouldn't be a surprising tip or trick you need to learn in Monster Hunter Wilds. While upgrading your weapons comes down to forging new ones with Gemma, which is made all the easier with the wishlist feature, the early hours of Monster Hunter Wilds will force you to make new armor sets if you want to increase your defense. Once you get a bit further into the story, though, you will be able to upgrade your existing armor so you can keep all your favorite perks and skills associated with it. Here is when you can upgrade your armor and how it works. How to upgrade armor You won't be able to upgrade your armor until the early parts of Chapter 2. Once you reach the Oilwell Basin region and can access the forge again, Gemma will tell you about armor upgrades. Hunters have been preparing meals, sharpening their weapons, and sharing all the best tips and tricks for months waiting for Monster Hunter Wilds to arrive. Now that it has arrived, we're all ready to gather our friends and hunt down the most epic beasts yet. Fans have come to expect these games to last dozens, if not hundreds, of hours beyond just the main campaign. Going into High Rank hunts, grinding to upgrade gear, and taking on rare species can extend the fun for those who want to dive deep into the systems. But the question remains if Capcom had to scale down this latest entry, at least at launch, to account for all the new systems and improved visuals. Let's take a break at camp to find out just how long Monster Hunter Wilds is. How long is Monster Hunter Wilds? Determining how long Monster Hunter Wilds\u00a0is depends on what you consider finishing the game. If reaching the game's credits is your definition of the end, which comes after beating the main story, then you could expect the game to last anywhere from 15 to 20 hours depending on how many optional quests and hunts you decide to take. However, the main story only lasts through the end of Low Rank, with High Rank being where the game really starts for most players and also includes even more story content.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"ByLeonard Martin Schmedding  ByLeonard Martin Schmedding,  Forbes Councils Member.  Leonard Martin Schmedding, co-founder of Everlast Consulting.    AI voice agents are no longer a futuristic concept\u2014they are fundamentally transforming how businesses operate. While countries like the U.S. and China have been leading the AI revolution, my experience in the German market has shown me that Germany has traditionally been slower in adopting AI-driven voice automation. That is no longer the case. Our company was one of the first to recognize this potential. Running a German YouTube channel covering AI in business, I have been at the forefront of this shift, demonstrating how companies can leverage AI voice technology to gain a competitive edge. To fully capitalize on AI-driven voice automation, businesses must understand where it delivers the most impact. Here are some core advantages: In my experience, one of the biggest pain points for businesses has been customer service scalability. Traditional call centers are expensive and often struggle with long wait times. AI voice agents can eliminate these issues by providing instant, automated and personalized responses. A well-trained AI voice agent can handle customer inquiries, appointment scheduling, order tracking and complaint resolution\u2014without human intervention. This can not only reduce operational costs but also significantly enhance the customer experience. Businesses that integrate AI voice agents today are seeing: \u2022 Reduction in customer service costs \u2022 Faster response times, reducing wait times to near zero \u2022 Consistent customer interactions, free from human error This automation allows human employees to focus on higher-value, strategic work rather than repetitive service tasks. Beyond customer service, AI voice agents can streamline internal operations across industries: \u2022 In logistics, voice agents can track shipments, provide real-time updates and coordinate deliveries with minimal human intervention. \u2022 In healthcare, AI-driven voice systems assist in scheduling appointments, patient follow-ups and medication reminders. \u2022 In finance, voice AI can automate fraud detection, conduct KYC (know your customer) verification and handle routine banking inquiries. The result? Increased efficiency, reduced costs and scalable automation. Germany is a linguistically diverse country in Europe, and this presents both a challenge and an opportunity. AI voice agents, equipped with real-time language translation and multilingual support, are opening entirely new revenue streams for companies operating in international markets. Imagine a German e-commerce company seamlessly supporting French, Spanish and English-speaking customers\u2014all through AI-powered voice interactions. Companies leveraging multilingual AI voice agents have the chance to: \u2022 Expand their customer base without hiring multilingual staff \u2022 Reduce friction in international transactions \u2022 Offer a personalized experience without additional cost For businesses looking to scale globally, this can be a game changer. Despite the benefits, AI voice agents are not without challenges. German businesses must navigate these obstacles carefully to fully capitalize on the technology. Germany operates under strict GDPR laws when it comes to governing data privacy. This means that AI voice solutions must meet the highest security standards. AI-driven voice technology processes sensitive data, including: \u2022 Customer identity and transaction details \u2022 Personal conversations and support inquiries \u2022 Audio recordings that require GDPR-compliant storage To gain customer trust, companies must implement privacy-first AI solutions with clear transparency about how data is used, stored and protected. Many German enterprises still rely on outdated IT infrastructure that is not designed for AI-powered automation. But companies that fail to modernize their IT infrastructure can struggle to compete in an increasingly AI-driven world. To implement an AI voice solution, businesses should: \u2022 Integrate API seamlessly with existing CRM and ERP systems. \u2022 Use cloud-based AI models that work alongside legacy software. \u2022 Implement phased adoption strategies to avoid disrupting daily operations. Germany has dozens of dialects, formal and informal speech variations and industry-specific terminology that AI models must accurately recognize and process. Unlike English-speaking markets, where AI voice agents have been widely adopted, German-language AI models require fine-tuned training to achieve high accuracy. For example, AI models must distinguish between: \u2022 \u201cSie\u201d (formal you) and \u201cdu\u201d (informal you) in customer conversations \u2022 Regional dialects (e.g., Bavarian vs. Berlinerisch) \u2022 Industry-specific jargon in law, finance and healthcare Companies must be sure to invest in AI voice solutions that are linguistically advanced to outperform competitors in customer engagement and satisfaction. Businesses that want to dominate the AI-driven market must take proactive steps now. For example: Companies must invest in AI literacy, training programs and partnerships with AI pioneers to stay ahead. German businesses must shift from reactive AI adoption to proactive innovation to compete with global players. AI voice adoption will only succeed if businesses gain consumer trust. This means: \u2022 Clear communication on data privacy \u2022 Implementing explainable AI (XAI) \u2022 Ensuring ethical AI training practices Companies that position themselves as ethical AI leaders will be the trusted brands of the future. No company can build AI solutions alone. Businesses must collaborate with AI innovators, regulatory bodies and technology providers to: \u2022 Gain early access to cutting-edge AI advancements \u2022 Ensure full compliance with data regulations \u2022 Scale AI voice solutions faster than competitors AI voice agents are not just a technological trend\u2014they are fundamentally redefining how businesses operate. Companies that hesitate will be left behind. Those that act now will shape the future of AI voice automation in Germany. The question is: Are you ready to lead\u2014or will you be left behind?

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"ByR. Daniel Foster  ByR. Daniel Foster,  Contributor.  Adolph Zukor, left, Paramount president, is the man whose organization engineered Mae West's rise. Leo McCarey, right, is directing West in \"It Ain't No Sin.\" Do homes ever truly shake their storied pasts? Sit quietly in any aged home and tales of former owners and their well-lived lives reverberate. The residence owned by Paramount pioneer Adolph Zukor is certainly high-spirited\u2014it includes echoes of antics of such party guests as Mick Jagger and composer Kurt Weill. Further back, early stars that Zukor signed were a presence. They included Douglas Fairbanks, Gloria Swanson, Mary Pickford and Rudolph Valentino. Known as Mountain View Farmhouse, the 1930s Colonial-style residence recently came to market for $1.975 million. Set on nearly seven acres, the six-bedroom home was expanded in 1944, and in 2019, it underwent an $800,000 renovation. The 4,740 square-foot home, with a private lake and tennis and basketball courts, is located in the Rockland County hamlet of New City, located about 35 miles north of New York City. The home has woodland charm with its red stone and charcoal-stained wood. The renovation lends the rustic home\u2019s interior a a minimalist white-washed look, somewhat warmed by the retention of brick, sandstone, hand-hewn wood beams and wood flooring. Expansive windows frame the pastoral view. The surrounding idyllic landscape is graced with mature magnolias, weeping beech, dogwood and other plantings. Adolph Zukor's home was built in the 1930s and expanded in 1944. Approaching the home after passing through high gates, there\u2019s a sense of comfort in seeing the home\u2019s red stone, charcoal-stained wood siding and gables. The look perfectly pairs with the pastoral setting, as if geese might gather near the kitchen door and need to be shooed away. The home is set in the New York state's Hudson Valley. \u201cYou can\u2019t ignore the property\u2019s location in the historic Hudson Valley,\u201d says listing agent Richard Ellis, owner of Ellis Sotheby\u2019s International Realty in Nyack, New York. \u201cIt\u2019s a place to create and meditate as well as to entertain and celebrate. The vibe is exciting and energizing.\u201d The primary suite is adjoined by a den on the first floor, with additional bedrooms and baths on the second level. The layout feels logical, a flow that suits family living, as well as guests who love to roam and explore. A private lake lures plenty of wildlife. The renovation includes modern conveniences and a slate patio located off the open-concept kitchen. The kitchen blends into the great room, which is banked with white stone that frames a fireplace. Both the patio and great room face the lake, providing optimal views. Take a seat for a round-the-clock show: the ruffed grouse, cottontail rabbits, waterfowl and occasional muskrats that wander about, lured by the lake. Rolling Stones lead singer Mick Jagger during a concert in 1976. Jagger frequented Zukor's home, attending screenings. In the early 20th century, Zukor, the engine behind Paramount\u2019s success, acquired over 300 acres in Rockland County, transforming the land into a retreat. The property is adjacent to High Tor State Park, a 691-acre recreation area with hiking trails and views of the New York City skyline. The park can feel like an extension of the home\u2019s acreage, the serene landscapes separated only by zoning boundaries on a map. Zukor\u2019s early movies include \u201cThe Prisoner of Zenda,\u201d \u201cPeter Pan,\u201d \u201cBeau Geste\u201d and \u201cThe Docks of New York,\u201d produced from 1913 to 1928. Zukor is also noted for the 1931 film, \u201cDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\u201d as well \u201cShanghai Express,\u201d made in 1932. Students from West Orange Washington School watch as Adolph Zukor, Chairman of the Board of Paramount Pictures. pulls a switch to start an 1889 Kinetograph at the Thomas Alva Edison Museum in West Orange. Zukor, born in Ricse, Hungary, immigrated to the United States in 1889 when he was 16. With just $40 in his pocket, he attended night school to learn business skills and improve his English. In 1903, after opening and expanding a fur business, Zukor made his foray in the movie business by launching a chain of penny arcades that showed films. Zukor\u2019s home was part of the South Mountain Road artist community, a gathering spot for celebrities, artists and intellectuals during the early-to-mid 20th century. The winding two-lane road is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Zukor's former home, renovated in 2019, includes expansive outdoor spaces. The art colony was a chance for creatives to gather just outside of New York City to host events, discussions and party. Playwright Maxwell Anderson was a regular, along with composer Kurt Weill and his singer\/actress wife Lotte Lenya. Others included the actor, director and producer John Houseman, artist Henry Varnum Poor and Norman Lloyd. That circle of artists, and plenty of tragedy, is included in a memoir that Maxwell Anderson\u2019s daughter, Hesper Anderson, wrote in 2000: \u201cSouth Mountain Road: A Daughter's Journey of Discovery.\u201d The book revolves around the suicide of Anderson\u2019s mother, and includes notables who frequented the area.

{"date":"2025-03-27","content":"ByLawrence Wintermeyer  ByLawrence Wintermeyer,  Contributor.  Close Up Shot of a Computer Monitor Screen with Real-Time Stocks, Commodities and Exchange Market ... More Charts and Tickers on a Multi-Display Workstation in a Financial Business Office. The U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is not at the top of anyone\u2019s list for hedge fund commentators but it does have serious views on the subject. Its report in June last year said that hedge funds use of AI and machine learning technologies to assist in trading decisions, which has been a practice by some for years, raises several concerns as this technology evolves, including the risk of inadequate disclosures to clients and the potential for increased threats to market stability.\u201d It quoted the then SEC Chairman Gary Gensler\u2019s view that a financial crisis triggered by AI is \u201cnearly unavoidable\u201d within the next decade and cited the May 2023 incident when an AI generated image of an explosion at the Pentagon led to a drop in stock market indices. Gary Gensler is gone and AI regulation in the new administration is certain to be lighter but the issue remains. Arguably, the biggest concern often raised by policymakers and regulators about AI in financial services is the use of GenAI and Large Language Models (LLMs) which are complex and nuanced, often with a lack of transparency with the underlying information used in generating a response that is used to make investment decisions. This is especially the case in the regulated financial services sector. The CFTC released Report on Responsible AI in Financial Markets, in May 2024, was authored by an independent Commitee of experts to facilitate an understanding of the impact and implications of the evolution of AI on financial markets with five recommendations to as to how the CFTC should approach this AI evolution in order to safeguard financial markets - regulating AI in financial services was not one of the recommendations. Commenting on the report, Commissioner Goldsmith Romero said, \u201cI herald the foundational, iterative approach of the Committee to recognize both that AI has been used in financial markets for decades, and that the evolution of generative AI introduces new issues and concerns, as well as opportunities.\" \u201cHerding\u201d is often cited as a concern, where similar common models are used systemically important financial institutions or large cohorts of market participants, creating concentration risks, as pointed out in IOSCO\u2019s newly released member survey report, Artificial Intelligence in Capital Markets: Use Cases, Risks, and Challenges, though the report claims there is a lack of sufficient data in this specific area. The European Commission is consulting the industry on the use of AI in financial services with a view to regulating it, which is more the European way. Jack Inglis, ceo of The Alternative Investment Management Association (AIMA), says, \u201cA prescriptive approach to policy-making in this area could stifle innovation, placing European investment managers at a competitive disadvantage globally.\u201d AIMA, which represents many hedge funds, stressed advanced technologies have been used in the sector for years \u201cto increase business and compliance efficiencies, but generative AI now offers new opportunities for enhanced efficiency gains.\u201d Firms in the hedge fund industry, and across the financial services sector as a whole, invest heavily in their own technology, and in fintech and technology investments. After the Fed started rate cutting Goldman Sachs noted that hedge funds were buying technology stocks at the fastest rate for four months placing nearly almost three times as many long positions on the bet that information technology stocks would rise, compared to those with bets against them. That has of course changed since the start of the year and coinciding with the launch of DeepSeek. The Magnificent Seven or Mag7, now dubbed the Lag7, are down 16 percent so far this year. Markets being markets, there are claims now that Lag7 stocks are oversold. Goldman Sachs now says hedge funds are fuelling the biggest tech buying spree since 2021 with Clif Marriott in Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets saying, \u201cWe think 2025 is going to be a breakout year for the number of tech IPOs globally.\u201d The amount of capital invested in artificial intelligence is growing and similarly in cyber security, \u201cEuropean tech has evolved immensely over the past decade,\u201dadd Marriott. Investment by hedge funds in technology for their own business operations as well as for their investors is a major issue and one that research from Beacon Platform Inc. has explored in depth in a new research report, Hedge Funds in 2024: Risks, Resilience, and Technology.  Asset Tarabayev, chief product officer at Beacon, sums it up the report saying, \u201cHedge funds clearly understand that data and systems integration are essential components of both risk visibility and competitive advantage.\u201d The report from Beacon, a cross-asset portfolio analytics and risk management platform for multi-strategy hedge funds, contains some good news and some not so good news about hedge funds\u2019 use of technology. The good news is that institutional investors are predicting strong growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns in the hedge fund sector and are planning to back expansion with increased allocations. Almost all (93 percent) questioned expect an increase in fundraising by hedge funds of 10 percent or more over the next three years with 14 percent predicting growth of more than 20 percent. All institutional investors questioned believe investing in hedge funds will be attractive in terms of risk-adjusted returns over the next five years, with 17 percent describing it as very attractive. Data from Hedge Fund Research shows that at the end of 2024 total global hedge fund capital rose to an estimated $4.51 trillion, increasing $401.4 billion in the year. A major growth area has been crypto and blockchain with the HFR Cryptocurrency Index showing annualized returns of 51.4 percent and cumulative gains of 694.6 percent over five years. The not so good news is that, for all the investment in technology and talk of the use of generative AI and innovation, the research discovered the old ways have not gone away yet with 90 percent questioned saying their fund or department is wasting time with Excel spreadsheets and other manual activities. Almost all (92 percent) believe their system spends too much time on consolidating data from multiple sources while 81 percent say too much time goes in investment evaluation and 79 percent admit time is wasted on aggregating and measuring risk. Nearly three out of four (73 percent) say too much time goes into manual or spreadsheet-based analytics and 71 percent say this about trying to define P&L residuals. Kirat Singh, co-founder and ceo, at Beacon said, \u201cExcel spreadsheets clearly have a place in managing trading activity and risk management in the hedge fund sector, however, with so many saying that they are spending too much time on spreadsheets, there is a strong case for greater use of the available technologies. \u201cLeading funds are turning massive spreadsheets with millions of cells into cloud-enabled analytics, increasing the scale and speed of their analysis and decision making.\u201d Technology and its use in risk management emerged as one of the biggest risks. Most institutional investors questioned (88 percent) agree that the quality of information and transparency in hedge funds needs to improve, with 22 percent saying it needs to improve dramatically. It is an issue that is costing hedge funds money. 85 percent of institutional investors questioned have decided not to invest in a particular fund because of concerns over its management of risk, and almost all (93 percent) think that this will be a growing trend. Almost all (93 percent) of senior hedge-fund executives questioned said risk parameters are becoming stricter at their firm in terms of what they can and cannot trade. Almost all (95 percent) say they are having to reduce or abandon trading in some areas because of the growing risks or because they don\u2019t have a good enough understanding of the risks in that area. Credit trading is the area hedge fund executives believe is most likely to be reduced or abandoned due to tighter risk parameters. Technology is the answer or at least a big part of the answer in helping to improve risk management. Almost all (99 percent) of hedge fund executives questioned say their fund will increase spending on risk management over the next two years. 90 percent questioned admit transparency provided to clients and investors must improve with 23 percent saying it has to improve dramatically. More than half (55 percent) say investment in technology is helping improve risk management and technology is seen as a source of competitive advantage across a range of factors. It is also a major factor making it easier to launch new funds with 60 percent of hedge fund executives questioned pointed to technology as a driver for growth in the number of funds. Technology is just about as important as being able to raise funds with 61 percent questioned indicating this. The research found launching a new fund is so popular that most hedge fund executives suspect colleagues are planning to quit and launch their own fund with 85 percent of senior executives questioned are concerned about a colleague launching their own fund. They just need the technology, which is becoming both cheaper to buy and build. Technology is central to the development of the hedge fund industry and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future, however it is often a tale of two domains, from LLMs to spreadsheets. While the U.S. is focused more on voluntary guidelines for AI use in industries like financial services, the EU AI Act looks to be focused on comprehensive regulatory efforts, and classifying AI systems in high risk areas like financial services and healthcare. A good common ground for the hedge fund industry and policymakers and regulators is transparency - technology that delivers the transparency and outcomes that investors increasingly require will go some way to satisfying the drive to better oversight. The use of newer and greater AI technology monitoring systems to underpin financial stability would be a productive endeavor, and an innovate breaththrough, for policymakers and regulators - physician, heal thyself. It is time that governments and regulators master this new and innovative technology to satisfy the monitoring (RegTech) and supervisory (SupTech) requirements in industries like highly regulated financial services that are technology driven to seeking to meet the requirements of our complex society.","label":0}
