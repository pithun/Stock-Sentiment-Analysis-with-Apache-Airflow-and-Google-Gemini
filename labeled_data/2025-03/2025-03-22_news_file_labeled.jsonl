{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"It's Android v. iOS all over again.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  In the beginning, there was Palm. Or Windows. Or Nokia. Or BlackBerry. Anyway, then came Apple. The iPhone quickly became the industry standard for smartphones. Without offering any amazing new features, it captivated consumers in a way the existing offerings just couldn't. I spent far too much and chained myself to AT&T to get one, and there's a good chance you did, too. This did not last. Someone at Google had the idea to try and make the smartphone more accessible to people who didn't want to or simply couldn't spend an arm and a leg with Android, and everything changed. Today, depending on the exact time of year, eight of every 10 new phones sold are powered by Android, but Apple makes more money than almost every other phone maker combined.  One of the web's longest-running tech columns, Android & Chill is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech. We're about to see this happen all over again with wearables. In fact, it has already begun. Last year wasn't a great year for wearable sales (or any other goods, it seems), but it was a particularly bad year for Apple. That doesn't mean Apple lost money, but it does mean the company saw its share of the market fall while competitor sales increased ever-so-slightly. Nor does it mean that Apple's watchOS and the Apple Watch aren't a smashing success because the company surely made more pure profit for each watch sold than any other company could dream of doing. Again, this is exactly what happened with the smartphone. Very few people bought the first Android phones. Then Motorola and HTC made some headway (with the help of U.S. carriers), and the gap narrowed until places were switched. Somehow, Apple still makes more money, even today, thanks to a supernatural manipulation of the supply chain and the idea that Android phones are for \"poor\" people in North America. This is how wearables are going to play out, too. The Apple Watch is yet another product Apple makes obscene amounts of profit per unit because it's good at business, and people in the U.S., Canada, and a few enclaves around the world will rush out to buy another one the minute it's available. Basic math tells you selling 100 things and making $10 for every one of them is more than selling 200 things and only making $2 from each. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android  None of that matters to me, and none of it should matter to you. I want to love a wearable but have a hard time doing it, and when I do wear one, it runs Garmin's goofy proprietary software, not Wear OS or watchOS. It's the one I like more than the others, and what you like is never going to matter to me. You need to do the very same thing and use whatever you like without caring what I think or which company makes more money. It's also just the way both Apple and Google like it. One company wants numbers sold while the other wants profits per. Of course, Apple loved selling more watches than Samsung, but it loves the bottom line just as much. This all weirdly makes sense. If you have 30 companies each selling a good product that people want, collectively, they will sell more than a single company that sells a similar, yet different, product. Wear OS, like Android, is a commodity like corn or crude oil that other companies use to create their own product. WatchOS is not and only available for the Apple Watch. A company trying to do it alone will never be the market leader when it comes to sales. As long as Apple can capture customers in its reality distortion field and keep them buying expensive products and accessories to use with them, it will do just fine. Marketing is an incredible tool and Apple is the master at wielding it. Enjoy your smartwatch, no matter who makes it. Jerry is an amateur woodworker and struggling shade tree mechanic.

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"Boxing heavyweight legend George Foreman has died aged 76.  Known as Big George in the ring, the American built one of the most remarkable and enduring careers in the sport, winning Olympic gold in 1968 and claiming the world heavyweight title twice, 21 years apart - the second making him the oldest champion in history aged 45. He lost his first title to Muhammad Ali in their famous Rumble in the Jungle fight in 1974. But overall, he boasted an astonishing total of 76 wins including 68 knockouts, almost double that of Ali.  Foreman retired in 1997 but not before he agreed to put his name to a best-selling grill - a decision that went on to bring him fortunes that dwarfed his boxing earnings.  His family said in a post on Instagram on Friday night: \"Our hearts are broken. A devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father, and a proud grand and great grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility, and purpose.\" The statement added: \"A humanitarian, an Olympian, and two time heavyweight champion of the world, He was deeply respected - a force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name - for his family.\" Tributes poured in from others across the sport, with former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson saying Foreman's \"contribution to boxing and beyond will never be forgotten\".  The Ring magazine, often dubbed the Bible of Boxing, described him as \"one of the greatest heavyweights of all time\". \"[He] will be remembered as an icon of the sport forever.\" Foreman was born in Marshall, Texas, on 10 January 1949, and raised along with six siblings by a single mother in the segregated American South. He dropped out of school and turned to street robberies before eventually finding his outlet in the ring. Foreman won the heavyweight gold medal at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, aged 19, before turning pro and winning 37 consecutive matches. He lost only five bouts over his career. He beat previously undefeated reigning champion Joe Frazier in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1973 knocking him down six times in the first two rounds. His 1974 Rumble in the Jungle against Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, remains one of the most famous boxing matches ever.  Ali, the older man, was the underdog after he was stripped of his crown seven years earlier for refusing to be drafted into the Vietnam War. Foreman reflected on the legendary fight 50 years later in an October interview with BBC World Service Newshour, explaining that everyone thought he was going to decimate Ali.  \"Oh, he's not going to last one round,\" the boxer said experts were predicting at the time.  Foreman told the BBC he typically would get \"real nervous\" and have \"butterflies\" before any boxing match, but that night - it was the \"most comfortable\" he had felt. But the wily Ali used a tactic that later became known as \"rope-a-dope\", which wore out Foreman, causing him to throw out hundreds of punches before Ali unloaded on him in the eighth round and scored a knockout. After a second professional loss, Foreman retired in 1977 and became an ordained minister at the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ in Texas, which he founded and built. He told the BBC his defeat to Ali became the \"best thing that ever happened to me\" as it ultimately led him to \"get my message out\" through preaching.  He recalled that his preaching started small, on street corners and with friends, then grew.  \"We began meeting informally at various homes in Houston, and before long, the crowds became too large for most houses to accommodate,\" Foreman said on his website.  \"Eventually, we bought a piece of land and an old, dilapidated building on the north-east side of Houston.\" Foreman came out of retirement in 1987 to raise money for a youth centre he founded. He won 24 matches before losing to Evander Holyfield after 12 rounds in 1991. In 1994, Foreman knocked out undefeated Michael Moorer to become the oldest ever heavyweight champion at age 45. He became ad pitchman for his George Foreman Grill, which millions have purchased since it hit the market in 1994, thanks in part to his memorable catchphrase, the \"Lean Mean Grilling Machine\". Foreman was married five times. He has a dozen children, including five sons who are all named George.  He explained on his website that he named them after himself so they \"they would always have something in common\".  \"I say to them, 'If one of us goes up, then we all go up together,\" he explained. \"And if one goes down, we all go down together!'\" Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"Business Insider Edition  This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Mike King, who runs a suite of vending machines as well as Moneta Market, a full-service micro-market company based in Salt Lake City. The following has been edited for length and clarity.          I started out with gumball machines. I was in college serving tables, when I read an e-book online, and started buying them for about $50 a pop.               Then I met a guy who was selling full-size snack and soda machines and he was kind of laughing at me: \"Why are you messing around with all that small money?\" he said. \"If you're going to do it, do it for real.\" So I decided to go all in on vending, and built that up.               Then I learned how to do micro-markets, and realized the profit was better.               A micro-market is a small, unstaffed shop where people can justgrab things, pay, and go. Our point-of-sale systems are housed in steel boxes that we manufacture in China.               We run about 350 of them now.               Four years ago, when we started making these boxes, my initial impulse was to see if we can make them down the road, or in manufacturing hubs like Detroit.               Overwhelmingly, it was difficult to communicate with and deal with any American company that we reached out to. So I went with Chinese manufacturers.               In February and March, Trump announced that the US was implementing 25% tariffs on any steel, plus a total of 20% on anything from China.               We already had a 25% tariff on Chinese steel, so I'm sitting there thinking, \"Well, does that mean Icould have a 70% tariff if I order steel from China?\"               I started doing the math. To actually deter me from ordering from China at this point, the tariffs would still have to be quite a lot more.               I'm buying my boxes at about $250, and a 70% tariff would add another $175, making them $425. Once it's shipped and through customs, it'd be about $825 per box.               In the US, I might be able to do all that for $1,000-$1,200.               Even if the price in China got to be a few hundred dollars more, I'm probably still ordering from China, just because it's so much easier.               I think that once China realized that they were going to be the manufacturer for the world, they embraced that wholeheartedly and built an entire infrastructure around it.               I just don't see how America can compete at all with what China has built.               My box needs to be powder coated, and that also needs custom foam packaging around it, and a custom box made for it.               When I send a job to a metal factory, they're making the box and then they're putting it on a truck and shipping it down the road to a place that's powder-coating it. Then they're sending to a place making custom Styrofoam boxes, and then shipping it to a place with cardboard boxes made that fit perfectly. Then someone's shipping it down to the boat yard to get it to me.               All of those logistics are part of the price, and I don't have to think about any of it.               I might find a place in Fresno that's willing to make my metal boxes for a reasonable price, but there are so many more headaches.               In China, when they encountered a design issue, they scratched their heads for a bit \u2014 and within a week, had proposed tweaks. When companies in the US saw my designs, they threw up so many roadblocks and would have charged so much more to adapt them.               A US maker is also likely not going to powder coat the boxes, or package them, so that becomes my job to organize.               In the end, the tariffs will likely just add some costs to my business.               But it's a logistical nightmare to try to get something like what I'm trying to do done in America.

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"Business Insider Edition  This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jessica Cody, a 36-year-old from central Florida. From 2010 to 2014, Cody worked as a Walt Disney World cast member, appearing as Lady Tremaine, Pluto, and other characters. She also worked as an actor and dancer at Universal Orlando Resort from 2010 to 2013.The following has been edited for length and clarity.  Editor's note: Walt Disney World set a $15 minimum wage for cast members in 2021 and increased it to $18 in 2023. The company offers employee packages with benefits. In 2022, Walt Disney World Resort announced it would develop affordable housing with over 1,000 apartments available to cast members and the larger community in Orange County, Florida.           I was workingfull-time hours at Walt Disney World after the big stock market crash in 2008.               I was getting scheduled for roughly 70-hour weeks and at first that was fine. I was able to rent a room. But eventually Disney capped the number of hours you could work.               At that point, I could no longer pay rent. So I lived in my 2005 Chevy Malibu, which I parked in West Clock, the Magic Kingdom cast member parking lot. I slept there and showered in the locker rooms every day for months, trying to get more hours.               Honestly, there were so many people that slept in their cars in that parking lot.               You're not supposed to sleep on the property, but the company turned a blind eye. When I was living in my car, I was one among dozens of others \u2014 it was not just me. Security knew we were doing this, and they knew we had nowhere else to go.               While it was a theme park that put me in that situation, it was also a theme park that helped me get out of it. I got hired as an actor and dancer at Universal in November 2010. My first role there was for \"Grinchmas,\" a holiday event held at the theme park. Universal paid me $15 an hour, which together with my Disney hours, helped me finally rent an apartment with two other people and allowed me to afford basic needs.               I would never trade my time at Disney for anything. I learned more about the entertainment industry than I ever did in college or the audition circuit in New York City. I just think it is ridiculous that people have to choose between financial security and a job that fulfills them.               I no longer work at Disney or Universal. At Disney, I went down to seasonal, and when you're seasonal, you have to work a certain amount of hours a year to keep your status. I just didn't work enough.               With Universal, I had my son around that time so I switched to a different department. I was in the call center for the last six months of my time at Universal.               I'm now a dance teacher and choreographer.               Disney has made some positive changes in recent years with programs to help cast members. They also raised the minimum amount they pay people. But, in my opinion, it's still not a living wage as far as Orlando is concerned.               You can love Disney and still expect them to do better. There's no reason for any cast member to be on food stamps or unable to afford basic necessities. Until there are no cast members homeless or living on public assistance, we're not there yet.               That place would not be open if it weren't for the dedicated and amazing people working there who break their backs to bring joy to families.               Those are the people responsible for the theme park's success.       Do you have a story to share about working at Disney? Contact this reporter at ledmonds@businessinsider.com.

Pool\/AP                                       hide caption  President Trump has announced that Boeing will build the U.S. Air Force's next generation of fighter jets. \"They will have unprecedented power,\" Trump said on Friday, adding that \"America's enemies will never see [them] coming.\" Trump is the 47th U.S. president and the jet is being called the F-47. \"The generals picked a title, and it's a beautiful number,\" Trump told reporters from the Oval Office. \"Nothing in the world comes even close to it.\" Known as the Next Generation Air Dominance, or NGAD, the F-47 will join a legacy of high-performance jets, though little is known about its exact specifications, appearance or capabilities. Trump teased that the sixth-generation fighter aircraft would be \"virtually unseeable\" on radar. Although details on the contract's cost remain unclear, early estimates suggest development costs will exceed $20 billion, according to The Associated Press, while the final price tag would be in the hundreds of billions, The War Zone reported.  \"We've given an order for a lot. We can't tell you the price,\" Trump said. The announcement is a big win for Boeing, which has struggled to recover from a series of public relations crises and operational setbacks. The company's reputation has taken a hit after 737 Max crashes in 2018 and 2019, a door plug blowout in 2024, and longstanding problems with its KC-46 refueling tanker program. The F-47 will be built at a Boeing manufacturing space in St. Louis, according to St. Louis Public Radio. Boeing's stock rose by about 5% on Friday, shortly after Trump's announcement. Its largest competitor, Lockheed Martin, saw its shares drop nearly 7%. Lockheed Martin produces the F-35 jet, which still forms the backbone of the Air Force's air combat capabilities. But the F-35's have faced criticism \u2014 notably from Trump ally Elon Musk, who has called the F-35 an \"expensive & complex jack of all trades, master of none.\" Musk has instead called on the U.S. Department of Defense to invest more in drone technology in lieu of stealth jets. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said the new warplanes would send a strong message about America's commitment to remaining a global leader in military aviation. The new fighter jet, he said, \"sends a very clear, direct message to our allies that we're not going anywhere.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"Business Insider Edition  The most important meal of the day could get a little more expensive following President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico.          After much back-and-forth, the tariffs are expected to go into effect on April 2 and will cover products from manufacturing to fresh produce.               Mexico and Canada are America's two biggest agriculturaltrade partners. In 2020, 77% of imported fresh vegetables in the US came from Mexico, while Canada accounted for 11%, according to the USDA.               The price increases due to tariffs will likely fall on consumers, Target CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC earlier this month.               Like many US food suppliers, Target relies heavily on imported fruits and vegetables during the winter months. The tariffs could force the company to raise prices on these promptly, he said.               Trump has referred to the economic uncertainty inflicted by his tariffs as a \"period of transition.\"               \"There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big,\" he said on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" on March 9. \"We're bringing back wealth to America.

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"Pixel fans love this simple tablet, and $120 off certainly doesn't hurt either.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Cheap tablets always see the light of day around holidays and season changes, and quite a few tablet deals are starting to go live for spring. For example, Amazon has launched 30% off the Google Pixel Tablet just days away from its Big Spring Sale (March 25th-31st). This deal represents $120 in savings, so it might not be a bad time to pick up your next Pixel device if you were already in the market. The Google Pixel tablet was highly anticipated upon its release in 2023, and it's remained a staple for those who like the Pixel ecosystem. While it's certainly not a premium tablet, the Pixel tablet upholds the cozy Google look and feel, offering decent performance backed by the Tensor G2 chip and 8GB of RAM. It also includes a 10.95-inch display, and while it's not an AMOLED screen, it still offers pretty bright, vibrant visuals. Google Pixel Tablet 128GB: $399.00 $279.00 for Amazon's Big Spring Sale Days before the big sale, Amazon is offering a $120 discount on the Google Pixel Tablet, which is a great option for those with other Pixel devices. With fluid performance and a vibrant 11-inch display, the Pixel tablet lives up to the hype as far as mid-range tablets go. \u2705Recommended if: you like Pixel devices and need a simple mid-range tablet; you're looking for a tablet that will offer regular software update support; you want another display for controlling Google smart home devices or for integrating with your other Pixel devices. \u274cSkip this deal if: you need a tablet with a headphone jack; you prefer a tablet with smaller bezels or one with first-party accessories; you have extra money to spend and would rather upgrade to a premium productivity or work tablet. No surprise here; the Google Pixel Tablet was a pretty easy pick for the best Android tablet for Pixel fans category. From the smooth, utilitarian One UI to the easy integration with other Pixel devices, there's more than one reason why fans waited so long for this tablet to come out. To be sure, the Pixel Tablet isn't a premium-level tablet or one best used for performance-intensive use. However, it comes with a nice 10.95-inch LCD display that remains vibrant and bright (despite not being an AMOLED), and solid performance, as supported by the 8GB of RAM and Google Tensor G2 chip. This particular deal is for the 128GB storage configuration of the tablet, though Google also offers a 256GB version. A few downsides include the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack, and Google's lack of a first-party stylus or keyboard cover. But for most casual users or those simply looking to add a multi-use screen to their Google smart home, the price point here is certainly worth considering.

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"We know how [Techmoan] feels. In the 1980s we had a bewildering array of oddball gadgets and exciting new tech. But as kids we didn\u2019t have money to buy a lot of what we saw. But he had a \u00a35 note burning a hole in his pocket from Christmas and found a Casio RD-10 \u201ccard radio\u201d on sale and grabbed it. He\u2019s long-ago lost that one, but he was able to find a new old stock one and shows us the little gadget in the video below. The card-thin (1.9 mm) FM radio had many odd features, especially for the 1980s. For one thing, it took a coin cell, which was exotic in those days. The headphones had a special flat connector that reminded us of an automotive fuse. Even the idea of an earbud was odd at that time.  It was a good idea not to lose the earbud, as it had that strange connector. The earbud worked as the antenna and power switch, too. Oddly enough, you could get a slightly fatter AM radio version, and they even made one that was AM and FM. Unsurprisingly, Casio even made a version with a calculator built-in. It had a solar cell, but that only powers the calculator. You still needed the coin cell for the radio. The sound? Meh. But what did you expect? There was a stereo version, too. However, that one had a rechargeable battery, which was not in good health after a few decades. He also shows a Sony card radio that is a bit different. We were hoping for a teardown, especially of the rechargeable since it was toast, anyway, but for now, we\u2019ll have to imagine what\u2019s inside. We love nostalgic radios, although usually they are a little older. We miss the days when a kid might think it was cool to see an ad touting: \u201cOh boy! We\u2019re radio engineers!\u201d  I managed to find a thumbnail of the internals on Google but the site it linked to (radiomuseum) didn\u2019t seem to have the full image https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/mwZYXJ6 What happened to Techmoan, he looks awful!    If you are curious why there was a gap in uploads of a few weeks \u2013 it\u2019s because I have been very ill with flu. I\u2019m still not 100% recovered. My apologies for the rather wavy voice. Thanks for hanging in there.  From his video description. He could do with a  new belt and some lithium grease, and will be as good as new afterwards.

Apparently he has been ill, but is starting to feel better. I was also a little startled, but he has a couple of videos on his patreon explaining that he had some kind of enhanced flu and lost 10kg(!).  So hopefully all fine. It\u2019s actually utmost, not upmost. I\u2019d love to see a teardown of one of these. It must have taken quite some effort to implement RF and IF filtering in such a skinny package. Even with the DSP chipsets available today, you\u2019d have to work hard to get it that thin. Did anyone else ever notice that using the earphone or headphones in the power circuit of these small radios or cassette players always ruined the bass output?  I assume it was deguassing the magnets in the drivers.  That\u2019s assuming folks haden\u2019t destroyed the cords or lost them before you\u2019d notice the damage. Depending on the unit and your usage,  it would take a couple week to a couple of months to kill the bass. I have a vape pen sized, pocket FM radio, from Radio Shack, early 90\u2019s. Good reception and could almost get 2 days of run time, but it destroys headphones.  Finally tossed it in a junk box somewhere, after it nuked a fairly nice set of headphones (Radio Shack Pro-60) when I stupidly plugged them into it for only a couple of nights. P.S. I\u2019d love to find something truly like the original Koss type cushions that came on them, not the ebay knock-off memory foam stuff. In that period, a lot of items had a solar-powered calculator integrated, even other electronic tools who came with a battery. I had a small foldable (clamshell type) radio\/calculator, I guess about 8mm thick. And the inevitable file folders. When the craze had almost died down in the early 2000\u2019s, we got the euro and everything came with a currency converter calculator! Like these?: https:\/\/a.co\/d\/cncsaVp The ones I would need are for over the ear sized phones, so more of a loop vs a pad.  I\u2019d like to find something in foam or velour covering. The pleather ones make your ears sweaty too fast.  That said, I do appreciate you posting the link! Never know where I\u2019ll run across what I\u2019m looking for. The cheaper ones might have used a circuit with a single output transistor operated in \u2018Class A\u2019, I.e. a steady DC current is varied up and down by the audio signal, and the earphone is connected in series . This arrangement goes back to the 1960s at least, when expensive germanium transistors were all that was available, and the number used had to be minimised. The principle goes back to the early single-valve receivers of the 1920s. Remember all of the devices that were incorporated into the PCM\/CIA architecture? You could get all kinds of things. When I was a Cable Guy, we had cable-box-on-a-card for use in the then-nascent large-flatscreens and external-supplier boxes. It wasn\u2019t a full box, just the tuner data, but still. There were network cards with pull-out \u201cthru\u201d connectors for RJ45\u2019s and modem cards with the same for RJ11\u2026 I think some cable boxes are the only thing still using those cards for cable card. I had tons of the single space 10\/100 Ethernet and 56k modem cards but none of the adapters that that terminated to rj-45 and rj-11 Here\u2019s what one looked like\u2026 https:\/\/www.recycledgoods.com\/us-robotics-33-6k-megahertz-pcmcia-modem-ethernet-xjem3336\/ Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  CRWD Stock CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock has experienced significant volatility this year, beginning with a robust rally from below $350 in early January to exceeding $450 by mid-February. However, this upward momentum abruptly reversed due to several negative developments.   The downturn began when the U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission launched investigations into a $32 million deal with Carahsoft Technology. Compounding these regulatory concerns, CrowdStrike recently issued forward guidance that failed to meet analyst expectations. Market conditions further exacerbated CrowdStrike's challenges, as broader investor anxiety about potential tariff impacts on inflation and economic growth created additional headwinds. This combination of company-specific issues and unfavorable market sentiment has driven CRWD stock down approximately 20% from its February peak, returning to around $360 per share. Now that CRWD stock has seen a decline, it looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy at its current price of around $360. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with CRWD stock, which makes it attractive, but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is extremely high. Although the high valuation seems justified, given the rapid revenue and earnings growth lately.   We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of CRWD stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of CrowdStrike along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, CRWD stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. \u2022 CrowdStrike has a price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 23.1 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500 CrowdStrike's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. \u2022 CrowdStrike has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 40% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.3% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Its revenues have grown 29% from $3.1 Bil to $4.0 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500)  \u2022 Also, its quarterly revenues grew 25% to $1.1 Bil in the most recent quarter from $845 Mil a year ago (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500) CrowdStrike\u2019s profit margins are worse than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. \u2022 CrowdStrike\u2019s Operating Income over the last twelve months period was $-120 Mil, which represents a very poor Operating Margin of -3% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500) \u2022 However, on an adjusted basis, CrowdStrike\u2019s operating margin stood at 21.2% for the last twelve months period. \u2022 CrowdStrike\u2019s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $1.4 Bil, pointing to a high OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 35% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500) CrowdStrike's balance sheet looks very strong. \u2022 CrowdStrike\u2019s Debt figure was $789 Mil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $89 Bil (as of 3\/21\/2025). This implies a very strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 0.9% (vs. 19.0% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable]  \u2022 Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $4.3 Bil of the $8.7 Bil in Total Assets for CrowdStrike. This yields a very strong Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 49% (vs. 14.8% for S&P 500) CRWD stock has seen an impact that was worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. \u2022 CRWD stock fell 58.3% from a high of $239.86 on 13 April 2022 to $99.96 on 28 December 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 7 December 2023  \u2022 Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $455.36 on 18 February 2025 and currently trades at around $360 \u2022 CRWD stock fell 50.0% from a high of $66.03 on 19 February 2020 to $33.01 on 16 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 April 2020 In summary, CrowdStrike's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: \u2022 Growth: Extremely Strong  \u2022 Profitability: Weak  \u2022 Financial Stability: Extremely Strong  \u2022 Downturn Resilience: Weak  \u2022 Overall: Strong Surely, CRWD stock trades at rich valuation of 23x trailing revenues, but its average sales growth of 40% and a stellar 85% average growth rate for adjusted earnings, seems to justify the premium valuation. Overall, despite its high valuation, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that CRWD is a tricky stock to buy. Not too happy about the volatile nature of CRWD stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"ByMichael Foster  ByMichael Foster,  Contributor.  Economic with stock exchange market showing stock chart down The market pullback we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of weeks really hasn\u2019t come as a surprise to me. The economy is sending what you could\u2014at best\u2014call mixed signals right now. And stocks, as they do in uncertain times, are reacting. I expect more volatility ahead, so today we\u2019re going to talk about ways to protect ourselves while maintaining the 8%+ dividend streams we\u2019re drawing from our favorite closed-end funds (CEFs). (Read: We\u2019re not going to cash here.) Instead we\u2019re going to focus on a strategy that\u2019s been around as long as investing itself\u2014diversification\u2014by putting a bit more weight on assets beyond stocks. That\u2019s what\u2019s great about CEFs: You can buy CEFs that hold a range of assets, such as the two I see as great diversification picks today: the preferred-stock-focused Cohen & Steers Tax-Advantaged Preferred Securities and Income Fund (PTA), with an 8.4% payout; and the PGIM Global High Yield Fund (GHY), a global bond fund with a 9.6% dividend. (Note that GHY is a holding in our CEF Insider portfolio.) Regular readers of CEF Insider know we\u2019ve been expecting the pivot we\u2019ve recently seen in stocks and have discussed it in the last couple of issues. After seeing the inevitable recovery from the 2022 mess throughout 2023 and 2024, it was clear that stocks had gotten ahead of themselves. And to be sure, the signals the economy is giving off remain murky. If the S&P 500 were to fall to a 10% decline from the start of the year, that may be a great buying opportunity (it\u2019s off about 3% from January 1 as I write this). Of course, I\u2019ll be watching those signals closely and will flag the moves we need to make in response\u2014buys and sells\u2014in CEF Insider. For now, though, let\u2019s run through the economic picture we have in front of us, and how it tees up growth for GHY and PTA. Over the last half-decade, the US economy has been growing at a strong clip, and we\u2019ve settled at around a 2.5% growth rate after inflation (that mention of inflation is important: we\u2019re talking about real growth in the economy, regardless of how high or low inflation is). This is good news, and it points to a basic stability in the economy that, over the long term, is bullish; America is growing at around 2.5% per year, pretty close to the 3.1% average we\u2019ve seen since 1948 and close enough to the 2.8% average we\u2019ve seen in the last 50 years. In short, the economy overall isn\u2019t in a bubble, nor is it in a sharp contraction. Things are, well, pretty okay at the moment. That\u2019s worth remembering after a month of ruthless selloff action because it tells us that in the long term, investments\u2014including stock investments\u2014will pay off, as they always have. Still, markets, as they say, take the escalator up and the elevator down, and it seems like we\u2019ve already gotten in and someone has pushed the \u201cdown\u201d button. So what should we do? There is growing evidence saying that, yes, we should seek alternatives to stocks now. That\u2019s something we\u2019ve been actively doing in CEF Insider in recent months and will continue to do. This is also where PTA and GHY come in, as we\u2019ll see in a moment. First on the negative side, there are signs that both wealthy and lower-income consumers are losing confidence in the economy, with a decline similar to what we saw in 2020, when the pandemic hit, and in 2021\/2022, due to post-pandemic inflation. Consumer Sentiment This needs to be taken with a grain of salt, however. After all, the economy was fine in 2021, and 2020 was a great year for stocks, even with the pandemic, thanks to the Fed\u2019s intervention. But sentiment leads behavior, and if this negativity gets entrenched, we could see more people cut back on spending. Retail Sales Trend The above chart is where we can see some really good news, though. While it looks like there\u2019s been a big slide in year-over-year retail-sales growth over the last few years, this is wholly due to pandemic effects. In 2021, we saw a huge gain in spending because people could leave their homes again, and the slide in 2022, to a slight decline in January 2024, was a normalizing effect, like a slingshot that was pulled tight and then released before going slack. And since a year ago, we\u2019ve seen a steady rise in retail sales, to a 4% year-over-year growth rate as of January 2025. That\u2019s a healthy clip, and it signals that most Americans aren\u2019t pulling back quite yet. Still, there are alternative indicators showing that some parts of the economy are seeing weaker spending. Those include the National Retail Federation\u2019s more real-time indicator showing that retail sales went negative on a month-over-month basis in January and February. So we\u2019re seeing at least some consumer pullback as some people feel less secure in the future of the United States economy. If you are experiencing whiplash, I get it! Mixed economic data is notoriously tough to drill down into. But the key thing to keep in mind is that everything here points to a \u201cmid-cycle\u201d economy, where America is no longer going gangbusters, but it\u2019s not in a sharp pullback, either. That said, we are closer to a recession than we\u2019ve been in the last four years. Which is why it\u2019s time to pivot toward high-yielding alternative funds like the two I mentioned earlier. Let\u2019s start with the 8.4%-paying Cohen & Steers Tax-Advantaged Preferred Securities and Income Fund (PTA), which is cheap, with its discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) coming in at 6.8% as I write this, well below the fund\u2019s 4.9% average discount over the last year. This indicates that the discount\u2019s decline is purely the result of the market panic. That\u2019s partly because PTA is misunderstood by most investors. It holds preferred stocks, which essentially means it benefits from higher, stable dividends even if stocks fall (since they yield more on average and payouts are prioritized over those of common stock dividends). Preferred-stock funds tend to suffer short-term volatility when stocks first take a hit, along with any other non-government asset, only to recover soon after, when their high dividends attract passive income-seeking investors. Moreover, PTA benefits if the US economy is seen as weakening because that would push the Fed to cut interest rates. That, in turn, boosts the value of PTA\u2019s portfolio, since preferreds, like bonds, go up in price as rates fall. Now let\u2019s talk about the PGIM Global High Yield Fund (GHY), with a 9.6% dividend and a discount that\u2019s raced toward par lately: It now trades at just a 0.8% discount to NAV. I see that modest discount flipping to a premium because GHY, like PTA, will benefit if America\u2019s economy is seen as weakening. That\u2019s because a weaker economy means a weaker dollar, and a weaker dollar would, in turn, boost the value of the foreign bonds in which GHY invests. In short, both funds should be safe havens for income-hungry investors on more stock-market weakness. That makes both attractive pickups now, with GHY getting the edge from me, due to its bigger yield and \u201cdiscount momentum.\u201d Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Here\u2019s how it works.   News Weekly is our column where we highlight and summarize some of the week's top stories so you can catch up on the latest tech news. This is Android Central's News Weekly, your go-to source for a concise roundup of the week's most significant tech stories. This is where we delve into the top headlines that provide the latest developments and innovations contributing to the digital landscape. This week saw The Google Pixel 9a launch, the EU Commission dings Google Search and Google Play for breaching the DMA, One UI 7 gets a launch date, Verizon brings satellite messaging to any device, and Pebble watches are here.  Read more here and here Google's budget phone launched this week, and right off the bat, you see the Pixel 9a sports an all-new look, ditching its usual \"Pixel-like\" appearance for a sleek, flat rear panel that houses the camera array within the phone. While the big pill-shaped camera bump seems to be all but gone, the phone has the same rounded aluminum side rails as its predecessors. For its display, the Pixel 9a gets a slightly bigger 6.3-inch pOLED screen but is 35% brighter than the Pixel 8a. It also arrives with a massive 5,100mAh, which is larger than the standard Pixel 9 model (4700mAh). The device gets Android 15 out of the box, the new Tensor G4 chip, and seven years of OS and security updates. It comes with an extended battery life of up to 30 hours, faster charging, and two new colorways: Iris and Peony. Starting at $499, it has a smaller 48MP primary lens, sticks to the 13MP ultra-wide lens, and a 13MP selfie camera. But what about Pre-orders, you ask? Google usually makes its devices available for pre-order on launch day, but that isn't the case with the Pixel 9a. Google said in an email that the device will be going on sale sometime in April without an exact date of sale. In a statement to Android Central, Google noted a \"component quality issue\" affecting initial Pixel 9a units as the reason: \"We're checking on a component quality issue that's affecting a small number of Pixel 9a devices.\"  Read more here Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Alphabet, Google's parent company, is under investigation by the EU Commission. It posted its preliminary findings stating that two of Google's most used products are in breach of the Digital Markets Act (DMA). Legislation brought about by the European Union to regulate big tech companies so that they don't favor their products over other players on the market\u2014 leveling the playing field for other tech companies. The report claimed two things: First, Google Search showed results favoring Google at the top of the results page rather than similar services offered by third parties. Second, app developers who contribute to the Google Play Store should be allowed to steer customers to cheaper options other than the ones Google controls. Responding to this report, Google stated in a blog post that, while the DMA aims at being fair to all players in the market, these rules are \"having the opposite effect by hurting European businesses and consumers.\" However the company will continue to have discussions with the EU to come to a middle ground.  Read more here. Can we just say, better late than never? One UI 7 update of Galaxy devices finally has a launch date. Samsung announced this week that the official rollout for the stable version of the OS will arrive as early as April 7\u2014for those in the company's home ground, Korea, at least. Folks in the U.S. have to wait for another three days post-launch, aka April 10, to be able to see the update pop up on their devices. According to the announcement post, the first set of devices that will be lucky enough to experience the OS are the Galaxy S24 series, the Galaxy Z Fold 6, and the Galaxy Z Flip 6. While other eligible devices will see a gradual rollout post-launch \"in the coming weeks.\"  Read more here Verizon announced it is bringing satellite texting to any device via \"select\" Android phones. Verizon will bring this feature to its U.S.-based customers first. The company states users can \"send text messages to any other customer device via satellite when outside the reach of terrestrial cellular networks.\" However, this feature won't show up on every Android phone. Users with a Samsung Galaxy S25 or Google Pixel 9 series phone can leverage its newly expanded satellite texting. Verizon's EVP & president of Global Network and Technology, Joe Russo, said in a statement, \"This expansion of satellite texting capabilities is a testament to our commitment to ensure customers stay connected wherever they are.\" The company has started working on incorporating this feature as we speak. However, it will likely take two weeks before it's completely stable and ready.  Read more here PebbleOS watches have made a comeback and how! Pebble's founder, Eric Migicovsky, in a new blog post announced the arrival of two new smartwatches: the Core 2 Duo and Time 2. These devices are launching under Migicovsky's new company, \"Core Devices.\" Migicovsky states both watches are compatible with \"thousands of your beloved Pebble apps.\" Time 2 is a 1.5-inch e-paper display watch that will deliver \"less glare and reflections\" than its older watches. It has a 53% larger display with 88% more pixels, the Time 2 contains a heart rate monitor, as well as step and sleep-tracking capabilities. Core Devices had given the watch an IPX8 rating, too. The device also sports a microphone and speaker. The Time 2 is available for pre-orders for $225. The second watch is the Core 2 Duo, which the company says is identical to the Pebble 2 \u2014 but it's been upgraded. This smartwatch features a smaller 1.2-inch black and white e-paper display with a lightweight polycarbonate frame and three physical buttons. Like Time 2, Core Devices states it is \"targeting\" an IPX8 water-resistant rating. For $149, it includes a 30-day battery life, a speaker, a barometer, and a compass sensor.

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"ByWilliam Baldwin  ByWilliam Baldwin,  Senior Contributor.  For most of the 21st century, investors have been in love with the U.S. and lacking a motive to send money abroad. This year they have, for some reason, changed their thinking. So far foreign stocks are up 9% (dividends included), U.S. stocks down 5%. If you want to join the flight overseas, use this guide to cost-effective index funds. They all have expenses no higher than 0.16% ($16 a year per $10,000), assets of at least $50 million and, with four exceptions, very diversified portfolios containing at least 100 stocks. Counting all share classes, investors looking for U.S.-registered funds devoted to foreign stocks have 3,320 choices. Picking through that heap is an all-day task. Your work is simplified here with a roster of 48 Best Buys, all in the newer exchange-traded format, which means they can be acquired and held at any brokerage firm. The list is sortable. Sort by average market capitalization if you want just large or just small companies, by yield if that matters to you or by any other column. Yes. Lots of foreign funds charge 2% or more, including the money handed over to the stockbrokers for persuading you to buy these funds. Continuing that kind of damage over a working lifetime will cut your retirement wealth in half. Over the same period, a fund charging 0.05% will cost you a cumulative 2%. Future returns matter a lot, but there\u2019s no way to know them. So we are necessarily talking about past performance. The question is whether terrific past performance of a money manager makes up for a bad expense ratio. The answer: almost never. Consider this disparity: Over the past decade, large foreign stocks have beaten small ones. This doesn\u2019t tell you that large stocks are the better investment now. Maybe what you are witnessing is that small stocks have gotten too cheap and are now about to catch up. A na\u00efve investor will say, \u201cI don\u2019t care if my money manager charges 2%. He is beating the market by 5%, so I\u2019m still 3% ahead.\u201d Wrong tense. There is no \u201cis beating.\u201d There is only \u201chas beaten.\u201d And past performance is only a faint indicator of future performance. Usually at some rate worse than the rate on U.S. dividends but better than the rate on U.S. bond interest. Foreign dividends collected by U.S. citizens are first taxed in the payer\u2019s home country, typically at a 15% rate, and then by the U.S. If your foreign fund is held in a taxable account, you can recover some or all of the foreign tax via a credit against your U.S. tax bill. How much of those foreign taxes you can recover depends on some insanely complicated formulas described here. Let\u2019s suppose you are able to get back two-thirds of the foreign tax as a credit, and that you are in the 15% U.S. bracket for dividends. Then your combined tax rate is 20% (15% plus 15% minus 10%). That\u2019s worse than the 15% rate you owe on most U.S. dividends but not as bad as the 24% rate you might be paying on interest income. If the foreign stock fund is in a tax-sheltered account, the 15% lost to foreign tax collectors is not recoverable. That, by itself, is not a reason to keep the foreign investments outside the shelter. Outside, they incur the same 15% foreign levy plus, usually, some incremental U.S. tax (whatever is not offset by the credit). Rule of thumb: Use space in your IRA and 401(k) first to hold your fixed income investments, next to hold foreign stock funds. U.S. stocks are last in line to go behind the shelter. Well, they are fat. That doesn\u2019t make them good. The 3.1% yield on the Vanguard Total International Stock Fund is better than double the 1.2% yield on the fund\u2019s U.S. counterpart. But you would be better off with lower dividends abroad and higher capital gains. The appreciation is taxed only when you sell and doesn\u2019t incur a tax by the foreign government. If you need steady cash in retirement, dividends are not the only way to get it. To draw 3% from a portfolio yielding 1.2%, cash in the dividends and also 1.8% of the shares. Over the past decade they were a terrible place to invest. Now the stocks in countries like China, Brazil and India are cheap, trading at roughly half the multiples of earnings seen in the U.S. Research Affiliates, a large money manager with a passive-adjacent strategy, puts out 10-year forecasts of real annual returns (dividends added, inflation subtracted). It has large U.S. growth stocks, the ones that have done best over the past decade, down for -0.5%, emerging market value stocks at +7.9%. But \u201cemerging\u201d is a euphemism for \u201cworrisome.\u201d The Russian market once offered a tempting collection of cheap banks and oil producers. The iShares Russia ETF is now in the midst of an inglorious liquidation. Most emerging-market funds have a large allocation to China (Vanguard\u2019s is 29%), although there\u2019s one China-free option on our list. Do you really want to bet on an economy overseen by a tyrant? What motivated you to look overseas to begin with? If you are already doing business at Fidelity, Schwab or Vanguard, it might make sense to buy the house-brand, no-load mutual fund available there. Fidelity Zero is a good choice for an international mutual fund. Vanguard\u2019s mutual funds are often copycats of its ETFs but with a slightly higher expense ratio. A no-load mutual fund has no transaction cost, while going in and out of an ETF costs you the bid\/ask spread. The spread comes to $1.60 on a $10,000 trade at Vanguard Total International Stock Index, the largest foreign ETF. The transaction cost can be stiffer at smaller ETFs. For most investors, though, ETFs are better, for three reasons. First is that long-term holders do better paying the transaction cost just once by buying an ETF. At a mutual fund, impatient investors get a free ride going in and out, imposing their trading cost damage on fellow shareholders and nibbbling away on everyone\u2019s long-term return. Next is that ETFs are very portable from one brokerage account to another. In contrast, a new broker might not be willing to hold a mutual fund run by a rival firm. You might be forced to liquidate and pay tax on the appreciation. Last is that ETFs are better at tax time. Mutual funds often disgorge unwanted capital gain dividends on holders, while ETFs rarely do. If you are holding the foreign ETF in a tax-sheltered account, of course, this consideration does not apply.","label":1}

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"Business Insider Edition  Airbus has a strong aircraft portfolio, and its deliveries consistently outpace Boeing's. But one of its planes has proven to be a commercial flop: the Airbus A330-800neo.          The jet flies further than its A330-900neo sister, but it has a higher per-seat fuel burn while carrying fewer people \u2014 tanking potential profits.                Only three airlines operate the plane: Air Greenland, Kuwait Airways, and Uganda Airlines. This year, it will go to one new city.                Beginning May 18, Uganda Airlines will launch four-times-weekly A330-800neo flights between Entebbe and London Gatwick Airport, bridging the two countries nonstop for the first time since 2015.               It's the first time London has welcomed the jet since September 2023. People who hope to experience the ultra-rare plane can board in about three dozen cities worldwide this year.               Data from the aviation analytics company Cirium shows only about 4,600 A330-800neo flights are scheduled for 2025, up about 450 from 2024.               Here is every route the A330-800neo is scheduled to fly this year, per Cirium data. Kuwait, the plane's launch customer in 2020, is the largest operator.               Nuuk is a new A330-800neo city as of November 2024. Air Greenland \u2014 the plane's smaller operator \u2014 inaugurated widebody flights from the country's capital after the airport built a bigger runway.               The airline's A330-800neo route to Reyjavik is also new in 2025 but will only fly two roundtrips, one in June and one in August. The route will otherwise use Boeing 737-800s and De Havilland Dash 8 turboprops.               Kuala Lumpur is a returning route for Kuwait, which last flew to the city in October 2023. Kuwait won't fly its A330-800neo to Bangkok in 2025 like it did last year, swapping the route for the larger Boeing 777-300ER.               A handful of Kuwait's routes will only fly a few roundtrips in April, including to Lahore and Islamabad in Pakistan and to Tbilisi, Georgia. Munich will run twice in June.               Kuwait's service to Ahmedabad, India, and Mashhad, Iran, were omitted from the map because they were single roundtrips that already operated in February and March.               One major market absent from the global A330-800neo network is the US.               Kuwait last flew the aircraft nonstop to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport in October 2023 but has since swapped the jet for the Boeing 777-300ER.               The A330-800neo was built as a longer-range version of the A330-900neo, flying about 1,000 miles further than its sister aircraft. The range was supposed to be the main selling point, but it hasn't been enough to offset its less favorable size and costs.               The A330-800neo can carry up to 406 people, compared to up to 465 passengers on the A330-900neo. Both are powered by next-generation Rolls Royce Trent 7000 engines that burn 25% less fuel than older A330s.               The A330-800neo's shrunken size and complementary efficiency may seem like a sweet spot on lower-demand, far-away routes, but the per-seat cost is greater because the plane holds fewer people while still carrying the same structural components and engines as the A330-900neo.               The A330-900neo's capacity allows for more revenue potential, especially since the larger cabin can accommodate more high-dollar business or first-class seats. Plus, the A330-900neo's 8,300-mile range is already suitable for airlines' needs.               The A330-800neo's unfavorable economics have made it Airbus' worst-selling plane. Air Greenland has one, Kuwait Airways has four, and Uganda Airlines has two. One unnamed private operator bought a single unit in 2023.               However, Garuda Indonesia canceled its purchase agreement for four A330-800neos in October, bringing the plane's net orders to just eight over 11 years.               The A330-900neo has garnered nearly 400 orders during the same time and Cirium data shows it will fly about 82,000 scheduled flights in 2025.               No one has ordered the A330-800neo in nearly two years, though the plane's cheaper $260 million price tag could help recoup the higher operating costs. The sister plane is nearly $300 million.               Still, it's unclear whether Airbus will eventually abandon the project or keep it as an option, considering it invested in the plane and possibly doesn't want those efforts wasted.

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"Under Elon Musk\u2019s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, the Social Security Administration has sought to downsize and reorganize its operations. This week, the agency made the highly controversial decision to nix identity verification over the phone. The policy shift threatens to force millions of seniors (many of which have poor mobility) to travel to field offices to receive their benefits. At the same time, DOGE has been closing SSA field offices across the country, making it increasingly difficult to access those offices. Organizations like Social Security Works are organizing to fight the changes, and they hope to spur a groundswell of activism that can convince the government to reverse course. Still, the group\u2019s executive director, Alex Lawson, thinks that the SSA\u2019s recent policy change will have immediate and disastrous impacts on the agency\u2019s ability to deliver retirement benefits to Americans. \u201cWe know exactly how it will impact benefits,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cThere will be tragedies, people will be harmed, people will die.\u201d It\u2019s pretty clear, Lawson added, that the goal of Musk\u2019s DOGE is to destroy the Social Security program from the inside out. \u201cYou listen to Elon Musk on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast and you hear his disdain, his hatred of Social Security,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cHe thinks it is an incredible net negative for the country.\u201d The SSA, which is currently being led by a new, DOGE-linked director, has argued that the policy shift is about rooting out fraud and abuse within the program (which is also the ostensible goal of DOGE), but critics maintain that the real intent is to drive the agency into dysfunction. \u201cMany people will just not be able to get benefits,\u201d said Lawson. Huge numbers of retirees are going to be driven into SSA field offices that were \u201calready straining, even before the Trump presidency,\u201d he said, noting that even under Biden, the agency was already at fifty-year staffing lows. The changes under Trump are now threatening to destroy the agency\u2019s operations and its ability to dispense benefits, he said. \u201cNow you have firings, buyouts, they\u2019ve closed 45 offices, they\u2019ve instructed GSA [the General Services Administration] to end the leases on all of them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all aimed at creating a crisis, at collapsing the system.\u201d The Trump administration even seems to have admitted that recent policy shifts could disrupt service delivery, with the U.S. Commerce Secretary, billionaire Howard Lutnick, going on TV and claiming that an occasional drop in retirement benefits is really not that big of a deal. Howard Lutnick: \"Let's say Social Security didn't send out their checks this month, my mother-in-law\u2014 who's 94\u2014 she wouldn't call and complain. She just wouldn't. She'd just think something I messed up.\" pic.twitter.com\/Nez8FdEEAN \u2014 Ron Smith (@Ronxyz00) March 21, 2025  Lawson said that the tactics being employed are a very old strategy used by private actors to attack public systems. \u201cKneecap the mailman, complain that the mail is late, suddenly remember that you\u2019ve got a cousin in the private mail delivery service and that they\u2019ll do it for twice as much and deliver half.\u201d Part of the strategy is to \u201clower public confidence\u201d in Social Security as a program, he said: \u201cIf you can convince people that they\u2019re going to get nothing, they will be willing to accept less than they\u2019re owed.\u201d The only thing DOGE is doing efficiently is hurting the Social Security program, he added. Lawson said he doesn\u2019t think Musk understands the benefits of Social Security because he comes from a background in which economic security was never a question. \u201cHe was born with an emerald mine,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cNot even a silver spoon. An emerald mine. He\u2019s not a normal person.\u201d Musk has denied multiple times that his family owned stakes in South African emerald mines or that the profits from said mines funded his early career, but his own father, Errol Morris, has said that the family was involved in the emerald trade and that his son\u2019s denials were \u201cjust because, you see, he wants to tell the people in America that he also had a hard time.\u201d In 2016, Elon, himself, told Forbes that his father had \u201ca share in an Emerald mine in Zambia\u201d when he was 15 years old. Musk has referred to Social Security as a \u201cPonzi scheme,\u201d which Lawson said is a ridiculous comparison since Ponzi schemes are about taking someone\u2019s money and not giving anything back, while Social Security is funded by Americans\u2019 money and often returns more than retirees actually pay in. \u201cA Ponzi scheme is a criminal enterprise based on fraud that benefits one or a group of criminal actors at the top,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cSocial Security is a very transparent\u2014you can find out where every nickel and dime goes\u2014social insurance, pay-as-you-go system. It\u2019s wage insurance. There\u2019s nobody who\u2019s profiting from Social Security. There\u2019s nobody on top of the program who\u2019s getting money out of it. There\u2019s no profits from it. All of it goes back to the people who are paying in.\u201d Lawson compared the goal of privatizing Social Security to America\u2019s previous transition away from defined benefit pension plans and towards 401ks. Americans are much less secure within the 401k system, which is tied to the stock market, he said. The private sector literally cannot provide the same benefits that the SS program does because you can\u2019t turn a profit from what Social Security provides, Lawson said. Social Security is not designed to make money, it\u2019s designed to ensure that people can enjoy old age without working themselves to death. Cuts to the Social Security program will create real, tangible harm to untold numbers of people, the activist added, noting that he had recently spoken with a lot of seniors who were incredibly frightened about what the cuts would mean for them. \u201cYou miss one check and people are like, \u2018I can\u2019t fucking eat. What am I supposed to do? It\u2019s all I\u2019ve got, I\u2019m going to get thrown out.\u2019 You talk to these people and they want me to tell them there\u2019s nothing to be scared of. There\u2019s a lot to be scared of right now.\u201d However, Lawson said his organization hopes to convert Americans\u2019 fear into rage\u2014the kind that will motivate them to get involved politically. The goal is to inspire a lot of people to come out and support their crusade against DOGE in the coming weeks\u2014like on April 5th, when the group is organizing a national day of action. \u201cThis is a guy stealing our money. I don\u2019t think little Elon Musk understands the magnitude of what he\u2019s fucking with right now,\u201d Lawson said. \r           Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r          \r           News from the future, delivered to your present.\r          \r       Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r      We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites. \u00a92025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"ByRachel King  ByRachel King,  Contributor.  Falanghina is an ancient Italian white grape variety known for its vibrant acidity, floral aromas and notes of citrus, apple and herbs, primarily grown in the Campania region. As wine consumers increasingly seek out alternatives to mainstream varietals, falanghina, an ancient grape variety from southern Italy, is gaining attention as a potential contender to stand alongside pinot grigio in the global market. With its crisp acidity, citrus-forward profile and refreshing minerality, falanghina offers an appealing option for those looking to expand their palates. Grown primarily in the Campania region, falanghina\u2019s unique characteristics have earned it a growing reputation among sommeliers and wine enthusiasts alike. And falanghina\u2019s rise in popularity comes at a time when wine drinkers are showing greater openness to lesser-known grapes. \u201cConsumers are more open. They still need advice to try something new but are way more keen to try than in the past,\u201d says Antonio Capaldo, general manager of Feudi di San Gregorio, a Campania winery that has been operating since 1986. This trend is part of a broader shift in the wine industry, where consumers are seeking diversity in their wine experiences and moving beyond familiar options like pinot grigio. Wine sales have been a mixed bag all over the world in 2024, but Italian wine exports to the United States appear to have remained steady. The global pinot grigio wine market was valued at $2.5 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach $4.13 billion by 2031, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.4% between 2024 and 2031, according to Market Research Pulse. Pinot grigio has long been a popular choice among wine drinkers, from Michelin-star restaurants down to dive bars. Primarily produced in northern Italy, particularly in the Veneto and Friuli regions, pinot grigio is known for its light, crisp and refreshing profile, often with flavors of green apple, citrus and pear. Pinot grigio is the Italian name for the pinot gris grape, which is also grown in regions like France\u2019s Alsace. Thus, pinot grigio is not just versatile in flavor but it\u2019s also just grown more widely. But that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for a little more competition. Falanghina\u2019s appeal lies in its balance of freshness and complexity. \u201cWhat makes falanghina unique is the coexistence of aromaticity, due to the grape, and sapidity, thanks to the mineral soil of the most optimal area of origin, the high hills around Benevento, in Campania,\u201d he explains. This balance allows the wine to retain a certain sophistication while remaining accessible to a broad range of wine drinkers. Comparisons between falanghina and pinot grigio are inevitable, given the latter\u2019s aforementioned dominance in the white wine market. However, Capaldo believes that falanghina offers something more robust. \u201cIf I have to compare it with a pinot grigio, I would say that it is somehow stronger and drier in taste, with more character but as pleasant and with richer structure,\u201d he notes\ufffc. These qualities make falanghina a compelling choice for wine drinkers who enjoy a dry, full-bodied white wine but are looking for something with a bit more personality. The regions where falanghina is grown play a crucial role in shaping its characteristics. Campania, which accounts for over 90% of falanghina\u2019s production, provides an ideal terroir with its volcanic soils, high altitudes, and Mediterranean climate. \u201cThis area is characterized by great ventilation, good humidity with over 130 days of rain per year, and interesting complex soils with a good volcanic presence,\u201d says Capaldo\ufffc. These conditions contribute to the grape\u2019s distinctive structure and complexity, while the semi-aromatic nature of the varietal adds depth to the wine\u2019s nose. While falanghina may not yet be as widely recognized as pinot grigio, its versatility in food pairings could help elevate its status. The wine\u2019s dry, aromatic profile makes it an excellent match for a range of dishes, from seafood and poultry to pizza and mozzarella. \u201cNot just fish dishes (both raw and cooked) but also poultry and many appetizers,\u201d Capaldo adds. He also highlights falanghina\u2019s suitability for pairing with Asian cuisine, a nod to its adaptability across different culinary traditions. Sustainability is another factor that could drive falanghina\u2019s rise in popularity, particularly among today\u2019s environmentally conscious consumers. In Campania, where small plots of land dominate the agricultural landscape, sustainable viticulture is a natural outcome of the region\u2019s fragmented vineyard ownership. \u201cYou don\u2019t find large properties but small plots, where the farmer grows several things, including vines,\u201d Capaldo explains . This commitment to preserving natural biodiversity, along with the presence of cooperatives that support small-scale farmers, aligns with the growing consumer demand for wines produced in an environmentally responsible manner. For those unfamiliar with falanghina, Capaldo suggests approaching the wine on its own terms rather than through direct comparison with more established varietals. \u201cMy advice in wine is to never compare one wine with another, but just enjoy it,\u201d he says. \u201cAll wines represent wonderful terroirs, and they should be considered individually.\u201d","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"ByJohn Buckingham  ByJohn Buckingham,  Contributor.  US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell holds a press conference after the Monetary Policy Committee ... More meeting, at the Federal Reserve in Washington, DC on March 19, 2025. The Fed paused interest rate cuts again on March 19 and noted an increase in economic uncertainty, as it navigates an economy unnerved by the stop-start tariff policies of US President Donald Trump. Policymakers voted to hold the lending rate at between 4.25 percent and 4.50 percent, the Fed said in a statement. (Photo by ROBERTO SCHMIDT \/ AFP) (Photo by ROBERTO SCHMIDT\/AFP via Getty Images) On March 19, 2025, the Federal Reserve opted to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. The FOMC statement began: Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. The unemployment rate has stabilized at a low level in recent months, and labor market conditions remain solid. Inflation remains somewhat elevated. The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. Uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased. The Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate. Of course, Jerome H. Powell and his colleagues downgraded their collective real (inflation-adjusted) GDP growth forecast to 1.7% (from 2.1%) for 2025 and raised their inflation projection to 2.7% (from 2.5%), but the Fed Chair at his Press Conference later that day had this to say in his opening remarks\u2026 The economy is strong overall and has made significant progress toward our goals over the past two years. Labor market conditions are solid, and inflation has moved closer to our 2\u202fpercent longer-run goal, though it remains somewhat elevated. Despite the Fed\u2019s relatively upbeat commentary, we understand that plenty of ink will be spilled over deciphering near-term movements in interest rates. However, history shows that stocks have delivered solid returns, on average, regardless of whether rates are rising or falling. In fact, data from 1954 to 2024 suggests that equities performed well in both high- and low-rate environments: Stocks entered correction (10% or greater decline) territory, based on the S&P 500, on March 13, 2025. While corrections happen every 11 months or so, on average, I understand that they can be disconcerting, especially as \u201cit is different this time.\u201d Market Corrections (and 10%+ Rallies) Of course, it is different every time and market downturns are inevitable. I have always been of the mind that the secret to success in stocks is not to get scared out of them, and I think it should be reassuring to note that all previous trips south have been followed by an eventual sizable advance. Just since the launch of The Prudent Speculator in 1977, the S&P 500 has experienced 10% corrections 39 times, with an average loss of 17.83% during those periods in the red. However, each of those declines was followed by a whopping average gain of 40.69%. While economic concerns persist, history suggests that staying invested\u2014especially in Value stocks and Dividend Payers\u2014has consistently rewarded patient investors. The Fed\u2019s stance may shift in the months ahead, and stock prices will always be volatile, but long-term investors should remember legendary investor Charlie Munger\u2019s admonition, \u201cThe first rule of compounding. Never interrupt it unnecessarily.\u201d For those looking to hear more, straight from the horse\u2019s mouth, check out my recent Webinar: 3 Market Myths Debunked and Q&A.

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"Two key upgrades  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  The more foldable iPhone rumors we come across, the more convinced we become that such a device is indeed going to see the light of day in the next year or two \u2013 and there are a couple of fresh leaks to report. First up, well-known tipster Yeux1122 (via MacRumors) says that battery life is a priority for Apple when it comes to the folding iPhone. Apparently, DDI components \u2013 the key display chip technologies \u2013 will be improved to boost battery life as much as possible. As foldable phones are essentially two phones stacked together, manufacturers try and ensure they're as thin as possible. That can have a negative impact on battery capacity and battery life, and it seems that's something Apple is trying to overcome. This isn't the first time we've heard that battery life is important to Apple and its folding smartphone. Just a few days ago we heard about other tweaks Apple is making to the display technology to increase the time between recharges. Dongguan EonTec is poised to benefit significantly from the widespread adoption of liquid metal in the hinges of the upcoming foldable iPhone. According to recent industry research, Apple is focused on improving durability, enhancing screen flatness, and minimizing crease marks\u2026 https:\/\/t.co\/KsGu49JXkPMarch 21, 2025 Our second leak comes from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who is usually accurate when it comes to Apple predictions. He says Apple is thinking about using a liquid metal hinge in the construction of the folding iPhone, to improve durability and make the crease less visible. The move, which would also improve the flatness of the main screen when it's unfolded, could be something that's followed by Android phone makers too, Kuo says \u2013 so stay up to date with our best foldable phones guide for any changes. It speaks to the care with which Apple seems to be developing this device: earlier rumors have suggested one of the reasons that we've been waiting so long for a foldable iPhone is that Apple isn't happy with the current state of display creases. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. With so much unofficial chatter around the folding iPhone now, it seems certain that it's something Apple is now working on.

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"ByCatherine Brock  ByCatherine Brock,  Contributor.  Emerging market securities have risk, but they add a new layer of diversification and upside ... More potential to your portfolio. Emerging markets have underperformed in recent years, but some analysts believe a resurgence is overdue. A report from RBC Capital Management notes some promising trends for these up-and-coming economies. China\u2019s dominance of the segment has lessened, emerging-market currencies have shown strength and the U.S. trade war likely won't involve some important emerging market economies\u2014namely, India, Brazil and South Africa. Does this mean it's time to expand your portfolio beyond developed economies? Let's discuss the pros and cons of investing in emerging markets, how much you should allocate to the segment and three ways to fulfill that allocation. Emerging markets are economies in transition from developing to developed. They are economic adolescents: They show some characteristics of fully developed countries, but they remain less sophisticated than the U.S., U.K., Canada, Germany and others. Relative to developed nations, emerging economies demonstrate: Investment research firm MSCI includes 24 countries in its emerging markets index. Six of the top emerging markets are China, India, Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan and Mexico, according to Nasdaq Contributor Prableen Bajpai. The advantages of investing in emerging markets include higher growth potential, diversification benefits and attractive valuations. Emerging markets can grow quickly. You can see the growth potential informally by reviewing the history of iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM), which tracks the MSCI Emerging Markets index. The ETF grew 338% from April 2003 to December 2007, which averages about 96% annually. In the past five years, the fund has appreciated 8.4% annually on average and is up 11.2% over the last 12 months. To be clear, these growth periods have not been smooth and easy. The iShares ETF has demonstrated dips as extreme as its gains. Even so, the emerging markets fund outperformed the S&P 500 between early 2003 and 2010. Since then, the S&P 500 has pulled ahead. Diversification is a strategy for managing risk and volatility. By investing across sectors, company sizes, asset types and geographies, you incorporate varying behaviors into your portfolio. Ideally, these varying behaviors have a mild offsetting effect when economic or financial market conditions change. Instead of watching all your positions lose value simultaneously, you might see some rise while others fall. The net effect is less extreme behavior for your portfolio as a whole. Emerging markets contribute to this strategy. For example, Brazilian or Chinese equities may experience gains related to local conditions that wouldn't benefit, say, Apple or Microsoft. Or, your domestic stocks may react more negatively to a U.S. economic recession than your emerging markets holdings. Emerging market stocks can be better values than domestic stocks. The P\/E ratio of the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF portfolio is 15.63. The fund's P\/B ratio is 1.97. Both metrics are modest relative to the S&P 500, which has a P\/E of 28.39 and a P\/B ratio of 4.87. Emerging market stocks tend to be volatile, partly because they are subject to currency risk and political risk. With greater growth potential comes greater volatility. Emerging market stocks can fall as quickly as they can rise. For example, the iShares fund and the MSCI Emerging Markets Index lost half their value in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis. They also dipped more than 35% between mid-2021 and late-2022. If the local currency loses value relative to the U.S. dollar, it can offset returns or magnify losses. Currency risk can worsen the normal volatility of emerging markets stocks. Purdue University\u2019s Craig Brown notes that the current trade policy uncertainty will likely increase currency volatility globally. Global U.S. companies like McDonald's and Amazon also face currency risk. However, these companies generate a lot of revenue in the U.S., which limits the relative currency effects. War, changing monetary policy and fluid regulations are political risk factors present in emerging market economies. These dynamics can destabilize the business environment, reduce earnings and shrink investment returns. Emerging markets assets are too volatile to be core holdings, no matter how risk-tolerant you are. Their ideal role is a complementary one. Alongside more stable assets, emerging market securities can add upside and improve portfolio diversification. Many investors limit their emerging markets exposure to a single-digit allocation. Here are some allocation data points to consider: The right allocation for your portfolio depends on your risk tolerance and investing timeline. You could start with a small allocation, say 2%, and then build your exposure as you get comfortable with these assets. To decide if emerging market investing is right for you, consider two questions: There are three common ways to invest in emerging markets. The lowest-risk option is purchasing a global securities fund that includes emerging markets exposure. You can also pursue a more targeted emerging markets investment with a dedicated ETF. The riskiest approach is via American Depository Receipts (ADRs), which are stocks of foreign companies trading on U.S. exchanges. Some global funds include emerging markets coverage alongside securities from developed countries. An example is Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (VEU). The fund has more than 3,800 non-U.S. stocks from around the world. The emerging markets securities account for 26.4% of the portfolio. You can alternatively invest in a dedicated emerging markets fund. iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) holds more than 800 emerging markets stocks. Another option is Vanguard Emerging Markets Bond Fund Investor Shares (VEMBX), which holds primarily government bonds from Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, Brazil, Peru and others. If you prefer individual positions, you can seek out emerging market stocks trading on U.S. exchanges. Examples include chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Chinese tech company Alibaba (BABA) and PDD Holdings (PDD), an ecommerce company that originated in China. For more investing ideas, see best stocks to buy for 2025. Bottom Line Emerging market securities have risk, but they add a new layer of diversification and upside potential to your portfolio. If you decide to invest, move ahead with a small allocation to funds or individual stocks, and build your exposure over time. Depending on your risk tolerance and investing timeline, you could invest 2% to 9% of your portfolio in emerging markets.\u00a0 Emerging market stocks are riskier than U.S. stocks. Political unrest, regulatory changes and reactive currency values can affect business results and equity values.\u00a0 China, India, Brazil, South Korea, Taiwan and Mexico are emerging markets in 2025.\u00a0 Emerging markets can outperform developed markets. This occurred between 2003 and 2010. However, over the past 15 years, developed markets have performed better.\u00a0","label":1}

The MSI Claw 8 AI+ offers powerful PC gaming handheld performance like we've never seen before. It easily outshines ROG Ally and Legion Go when it comes to frame rates in games, but the lack of customization options like VRAM adjustment is disappointing. Additionally, the unpleasant back casing texture takes away from the ergonomic grips and balanced design. Still, it offers responsive controls like Hall Effect joysticks, provides two Thunderbolt 4 ports, and has a respectable 8-inch VRR display that looks good in person.

Find out more about how we test.  I knew I wanted to write our MSI Claw 8 AI+ review as soon as this new Intel Core Ultra Series 2 Windows gaming handheld was revealed. I've previously reviewed the ASUS ROG Ally, ROG Ally X, Lenovo Legion Go, and several other Windows 11 gaming handhelds. As such, I wanted to see how the MSI Claw 8 AI+ matches up to these rival devices. \u2022 Pricing & specs\u2022 Design & build quality\u2022 Display quality\u2022 Performance & thermals\u2022 Battery experience\u2022 Software experience\u2022 Controls & other hardware\u2022 Alternatives\u2022 Score card & final thoughts Now, if you're familiar with gaming handhelds, then you know that the original MSI Claw A1M, which was released in March 2024, didn't really match up to its competition. It was the only mainstream handheld powered by Intel's Core Ultra Series 1 AI CPUs (central processing units), but it failed to keep pace with the performance of AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme devices like the Legion Go and ROG Ally. With all this in mind, I took to using the new MSI Claw 8 AI+ as my main gaming device for two weeks. I also ran it through several benchmark tests to see how it compares to ROG Ally and Legion Go. It's a much-improved device over the original, but is that enough to make it worth buying? And what's with the delayed launch? Let's dive in and discuss. I've been obsessed with video games ever since I was a kid and have been a handheld gamer since the 90s. At Windows Central, I review video games, gaming laptops, gaming handhelds, and various gaming accessories. My experience and analysis helps me know when a device is worth buying or when it's best to get something else.  This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by MSI. The company had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication.  Windows 11 gaming handhelds are expensive, and that's especially true of the new MSI Claw AI handhelds. \u2022 Price: $899.99 at Best Buy\u2022 Display: 8-inch IPS, 16:10 aspect ratio, FHD+ (1,920 x 1,200) resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) support, multi-touch support\u2022 CPU: Intel Core Ultra 7 258V (8 cores, 8 threads, up to 4.8GHz)\u2022 NPU: Intel AI Boost (47 TOPS)\u2022 GPU: Intel Arc 140V (8 cores)\u2022 RAM: 32GB LPDDR5x\u2022 Storage: 1TB M.2 2230 NVMe PCIe Gen4 SSD\u2022 Connection: Wi-Fi 7 + Bluetooth 5.4\u2022 Battery: 80Whr, 65W Thunderbolt 4 Type-C charger\u2022 Dimensions: 299 x 126 x 24mm (11.77 x 4.96 x 0.94in)\u2022 Weight: 795g (1.75lbs) MSI actually announced two Intel Core Ultra Series 2 gaming handhelds for this year. First, there's the larger black and sandy-brown \"Sandstorm\" MSI Claw 8 AI+ A2VM, which has an MSRP of $899.99 at Best Buy. Then, there's the smaller all-black MSI Claw 7 AI+, which has an MSRP of $799.99 at Amazon. These newer MSI handhelds are notably more expensive than the original Intel Core Ultra Series 1 MSI Claw A1M, which has a starting price of $649.99 at Best Buy. Outside of MSI devices, the most similar handheld to the Claw 8 AI+ is arguably the ASUS ROG Ally. It costs $100 less and offers a 7-inch display, AMD Z1 Extreme, 24GB RAM, 1TB SSD, 80Whr battery, and sells for $799.99 at Best Buy. That said, part of the reason why the Claw 8 AI+ is so expensive is that it is one of the only Windows handhelds that uses Intel AI processors with AI-boosted NPUs (Neural Processing Units) rather than AMD's handheld-centric Z-Series chips. Additionally, the MSI Claw 8 AI+ has some really nice next-gen handheld specs compared to other lower-configured rivals, which is part of what makes it more costly. Additionally, Intel chips also tend to cost more than AMD chips. Because it has this Intel AI chip, this handheld is technically an AI PC, unlike ROG Ally and Legion Go. MSI even goes as far as to label it a Copilot+ PC, although it doesn't have a dedicated Copilot button to meet this classification. The biggest problem with the MSI Claw 8 AI+ at the time of writing is availability. It still isn't actually available for purchase yet at many major retailers, even though it was supposed to hit the market already. I have no idea when this handheld will actually be widely available for purchase, but a Best Buy listing (and listings at other retailers) has been up for a few months now with no changes. When I asked MSI about Claw 8 AI+ availability, I was told that the handheld is expected to get restocked sometime in April. You can check out our MSI Claw 8 AI+ restock alert page for more info. MSI Claw 8 AI+ \u2014 Core Ultra 7 258V | 32GB RAM | 1TB SSDComing soon: $899.99 at Best Buy This is one of the only Windows gaming handhelds to use Intel AI-boosted chips rather than AMD chips. It offers powerful performance, great controls, and a nice screen. You can play it in handheld mode or connect it to a separately-sold docking station and play on TV.  \ud83d\udc49See at: BestBuy.com | Amazon.com | B&H.com | Newegg.com | MSI.com  While this device's \"Sandstorm\" coloring stands out from the usual sea of white and black handhelds, the design can be pretty divisive. Some of the Windows Central team loves the color scheme and see it as an 80s futuristic throwback, while others don't particularly like the look. You'll just have to decide for yourself. Design-wise, the new MSI Claw 8 AI+ offers some nice improvements over the original MSI Claw A1M. For one thing, the back buttons have been flattened, preventing them from getting in the way of the grips as much. Overall, the handheld has a balanced and ergonomic design, but I don't like the hard plastic indentations on the back, which feel unpleasant on my fingertips compared to the flatter, less-textured back casings of Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and Legion Go devices. Connectivity-wise, the new Claw now offers two Thunderbolt 4 ports, which means you can actually charge the handheld up with one port and have an accessory connected to the other at the same time. To further add to this device's conveniences, it offers the latest Bluetooth 5.4 and Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, as well as a microSD card slot for quickly expanding storage. Despite my aversion to the Claw's back texture, the handheld is well-balanced, provides good grips, and offers plenty of helpful connections for accessories.  While the MSI Claw 8 AI+'s 8-inch IPS touchscreen isn't the best handheld screen out there, it's large, responsive, and offers crisp details, a good color gamut, and a pleasant overall viewing experience. After playing games on it for a few hours, I connected a colorimeter and ran a color gamut test. The touchscreen produced 99% of sRGB, 76% of AdobeRGB, and 77% of P3, making it just slightly better than the respectable results produced by the ROG Ally X IPS display (see our ROG Ally X review for more details). Obviously, these results aren't nearly as good as what you'll get on a handheld with an OLED display (see our Legion Go S review for an example), but having an IPS screen rather than OLED saves on the device's overall cost. The device supports VRR (variable refresh rate) at up to 120Hz. Motion clarity in games is decent on the Claw 8 AI+ display but not always perfect; that's pretty typical with VRR-supporting handhelds. I'll talk more about gaming and performance in the next section. For now, let's continue talking about the display. Setting Brightness Black Contrast White point 0% 12.1 0.00 0 : 1 7300 25% 119.7 0.07 1630 : 1 7300 50% 239.9 0.15 1630 : 1 7400 75% 356.2 0.22 1630 : 1 7400 100% 469.7 0.32 1480 : 1 7500 I also conducted a brightness and contrast test while the colorimeter was in use. This revealed that the display's max brightness is 469 nits, which is decent but doesn't get as bright as ROG Ally X's max brightness of 536 nits. However, contrast is slightly better on MSI's handheld than ASUS' handheld. In the end, the Claw 8 AI+'s display is more than good enough for handheld gaming, with great details, good coloring, and a responsive touchscreen. It would just be nicer if it got a bit brighter, though. I arranged my 8.8-inch display Legion Go, 8-inch display MSI Claw 8 AI+, and 7-inch display ROG Ally X on my table by screen size to conduct a visual comparison between the three. Aside from size differences, each of these handheld screens offers tradeoffs. The Legion Go produces the very best color gamut of the three, as evidenced by its much higher AdobeRGB and P3 results. Gaming handheld Display color gamut Lenovo Legion Go 100% of sRGB, 91% of AdobeRGB, and 96% of P3 MSI Claw 8 AI+ 99% of sRGB, 76% of AdobeRGB, and 77% of P3 ASUS ROG Ally \/ X 98% of sRGB, 73% or AdobeRGB, and 75% of P3 However, I found that the glass used on the smaller ROG Ally X didn't tend to reflect as much as the MSI Claw and Legion Go glass, which makes it easier to see contrast and dark details in person on ASUS's handheld where dark areas on the other devices tend to look more gray. Overall, the MSI Claw 8 AI+'s display is not top-tier, but it's plenty good for handheld gaming.  Over the past two years, I've toted the AMD Z1 Extreme ROG Ally as the best Windows handheld performance-wise and motion-clarity-wise. But now, my testing has helped me see that the Intel Core Ultra Series 2 MSI Claw 8 AI+ offers a significantly smoother playing experience than it. To test the Claw 8 AI+, I spent over 12 hours playing several CPU and\/or GPU-straining video games, including Baldur's Gate 3, Ashes of the Singularity, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Cyberpunk 2077, and more. Overall, it played much more smoothly than ROG Ally and Legion Go, with less pop-in and significantly higher frame rates. Default Graphics Setting MSI Claw 8 AI+ Avg. FPS Legion Go Avg. FPS Ally X Avg. FPS Ally Avg. FPS Low 59.01 FPS 36.43 FPS 26.45 FPS 21.64 FPS Steam Deck 59.27 FPS 36.43 FPS 29.13 FPS 23.86 FPS Ray Tracing: Low 57.20 FPS 35.76 FPS 27.22 FPS 21.86 FPS To further drive this point home, I've also included the graph above comparing the Cyberpunk 2077 benchmark results of the Claw 8 AI+, Legion Go, Ally X, and Ally when these devices are at max TDP and running the same graphic preset settings. During testing, I also put the Claw handheld at its max 30W TDP and ran it through various benchmark tests. The Claw 8 AI+ provided a fantastic playing experience overall. As you can see in the benchmark results, the Claw tended to produce around 60 FPS or even higher when playing these more straining titles, which is significantly better than what you get on ROG Ally and Legion Go. Since the MSI Claw 8 AI+ is basically a laptop but with controllers attached instead of a keyboard, I ran the device through the same gauntlet of benchmark testing as I would a laptop. Starting with CPU analysis, the handheld produced a multi-core score of 10,446 and a single-core score of 2,718 in Geekbench 6. While not the most impressive results for an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V, these scores were very similar to other devices with the same processor. It's worth noting that ASUS ROG Ally X, ROG Ally, and Lenovo Legion Go all got higher Geekbench 6 multi-core scores than Claw 8 AI+, but the Claw 8 AI+ got the highest single-core score of them all. I also ran Cinbench R24 to check CPU rendering abilities. In this test, the MSI Claw 8 AI+ only got a single-core score of 120 and a multi-core score of 483, which is a bit lower than we'd like to see for this processor. For perspective, the ROG Ally X and its AMD Z1 Extreme currently hold the highest Cinebench handheld multi-core score of 724, but it also has a lower 100 single-core score than the Claw 8 AI+. Since the Claw 8 AI+'s Intel Core Ultra 7 258V is an AI-boosted processor with an integrated NPU (neural processing unit), I also ran some additional AI PC testing on it. In Procyon's Windows ML Float 32 CPU test, the handheld got a pretty low score of 60. However, the device faired better in Procyon's Intel OpenVINO float 16 NPU test, earning a score of 837. My previous video game benchmark testing showed that this device offers better game performance than other handhelds. The fact that the Claw doesn't match up with other AI PC devices isn't a huge problem, given that this has a very different end-goal design from other AI PCs we've tested. I then moved to 3DMark to test the MSI Claw 8 AI+'s integrated Intel Arc 140V GPU (graphics processing unit). Here, the handheld got a score of 3,882, which is the lowest Intel Arc 140V score we've seen in Time Spy so far. That said, this was a higher score than the ROG Ally X's 3,506 score and Legion Go's 3,247 score. I also ran 3DMark's integrated graphics test, Night Raid, and here, the handheld got a good score of 28,499, but it is lower than this processor's 34,451 average. With those results in, I used CrystalDiskMark to analyze SSD performance. The Claw's SSD produced a read speed of 6,068 MB\/s and a write speed of 5,324 MB\/s, which is better than the Legion Go's 5,016 MB\/s read speed and 1,620 MB\/s write speed, and the ROG Ally's 4,337 MB\/s read speed and 1,812 MB\/s write speed. What this tells us is that the Claw is faster than other handhelds at the important gaming tasks of accessing, loading, and saving data. To top everything off, I ran CrossMark to gauge the MSI Claw 8 AI+'s overall system performance. It earned a score of 1,665, which is higher than Legion Go's 1,588 score and ROG Ally's 1,508 score. TL;DR \u2014 While it didn't always get the highest scores in every benchmark, the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and its Intel processors dominated overall when compared against ROG Ally and Legion Go. In other words, it is an excellent handheld AI-boosted computer that provides smoother gaming performance than its rivals. This handheld doesn't get very loud when playing games or running certain programs. In fact, when I had my decibel meter right next to the vents the sound level only ever peaked at 52.9 dB during a CPU stress test. You're not likely to sit with your head against the handheld, so I also took a reading with the decibel meter next to my ear while I held the Claw at a normal distance from me. The sound level peaked at 38.0 dB, which isn't loud at all. Nearing the end of the 20-minute CPU stress test, I pulled out my thermal camera and took pictures of the Claw 8 AI+. Unsurprisingly, the hottest areas of the handheld are the main vents, which peaked at 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). The second-hottest area is the bottom center of the screen, which peaked at 99 degrees F (~37 degrees C). The back center of the Claw did reach a peak of 98 degrees F (~36 degrees C), but the areas that you actually grip and hold don't ever get overly warm to the touch.  Gaming handhelds all have one major weakness, and that is battery life. As it stands, the longest-lasting Windows handhelds only tend to run for about two hours when at max TDP and playing intensive games \u2014 this device doesn't break any new ground in this area. As with the ROG Ally X's 80Whr battery, the MSI Claw's 80Whr battery only lasted two hours and 10 minutes when playing Cyberpunk 2077 with max TDP and the screen at roughly 200 nits brightness. There were also times during my testing when the handheld only lasted about an hour and 47 minutes, depending on the games I was playing. Honestly, unless you only play quick gaming rounds, you'll likely want to use the Claw 8 AI+ while plugged into a charger or connected to a TV docking station if you want longer play sessions.  Since this is a Windows 11 device, it works like a laptop that has connected controllers instead of a keyboard. You can access the internet, run games, and open programs that are accessible on a normal computer. This, of course, means you can open other game launchers, including Steam, Ubisoft Connect, Xbox app, Epic Games, Battle.net, and more. The Claw 8 AI+ comes with MSI Center M installed, a software that functions as a game launcher, gives access to customer service, and provides settings adjustments, among other things. Like its Claw A1M predecessor, the Claw 8 AI+ doesn't have as many setting customization options as competitors like ASUS ROG Ally. For instance, there is no way to adjust VRAM on this handheld, which will be frustrating to people who want to tailor the system. However, going into the manual mode does let you change TDP between 8W, 17W, and 30W. Additionally, fan speed can be set to auto or can be manually adjusted via sliders. Since this is an AI PC, I can put the handheld in AI Engine mode, which automatically adjusts settings based on my usage of the device. This AI Engine mode works well and is especially useful for people who don't want to personally fiddle with settings. One of the other main functions MSI Center M provides is RGB lighting adjustment. The Mystic Light tab lets me choose between five effects and provides a color picker. I can create up to three profiles or presets to swap between. I like how vibrant the colors look around the joysticks, but I also appreciate that MSI Center M lets me turn the RGB lights off completely when I don't want colorful lighting aimed at my face. Compared to the original Claw A1M, the Claw 8 AI+'s D-Pad, buttons, triggers, and Hall Effect joysticks all seem similar, if not the same. The only big difference I can see is that the joystick tips have more texture on them for better grip control. As I mentioned earlier, the back buttons have been flattened compared to the original device, but they click in nicely and are responsive like everything else.  As with some competitors, this handheld's power button doubles as a fingerprint reader. It doesn't always work on the first attempt, but it can make the login process a lot more convenient. Since there is no built-in camera on this handheld, the device cannot take advantage of Windows Hello facial login. I'm happy to report that the two 2W speakers with Hi-Res support and the built-in mic are much better than is necessary for a handheld. There was a stretch where I was playing Baldur's Gate 3 co-op with friends, and my headset stopped working for some reason. Thanks to the mic, I was still able to effectively communicate with my teammates for several minutes until I got my headset sorted.  I've mentioned ROG Ally X and Legion Go so often in this review that my recommending them as MSI Claw 8 AI+ alternatives should come as no surprise.

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"Home Blog                        21 Mar, 2025                    I can feel uncertainty looming over the software industry as the hiring frenzy of the COVID era has given way to layoffs and hiring freezes. The power transferring from employee to employer is palpable. I see former coworkers, seasoned professionals grapple with imposter syndrome, questioning their self-worth. Despite the enormous privilege they've enjoyed, the feelings weigh on them all the same. If that's how they feel, what would it feel like to be a Waterloo student today? It brings me back to when I entered the ECE program amid the 2008 global financial crises. The first day of class, Donna Strickland\u2014who would later go on to win a Nobel Prize\u2014wrote a problem on the whiteboard, turned around, and said \"This problem is going to be on your final exam, so pay attention\". I had no idea what she was talking about, nor was I able to comprehend the problem. Next class, Calculus, the professor scribbles on the blackboard and says, \"We'll be reviewing integration for the first couple of weeks. Raise your hand if you've learned this before\". Most of the class raises their hand. I feel a pit in my stomach. What is he talking about? Then there was a time when a student raised his hand and asked a question in Mandarin. Professor responded back in Mandarin and continued to teach his lesson like nothing happened. If that was the classroom experience, exams weren't much better. Midterm exams, or as it was often referred to \"Hell week\". A series of multi-hour exams all in one week. The relief you feel writing the last exam is indescribable. Always followed by multi-day binge drinking to numb the feelings and forget the stress you just endured. When the midterm grades come in, it feels like a collective gut punch, a crushing 40% class average. For many, it's our first real taste of failure. And then come the grading gymnastics. Some professors curve the average up to a barely-passing 60% while others shift weight to the final, making the midterm pointless. As the semester concludes, the final report card arrives and I'm flooded with relief over a passing grade. New year brings new faces into the class, and a few close friends no longer there. A hard realization washed over me that not everybody made it. I start having nightmares for the first time in my life. The same nightmare, again and again: I get the report card, I fail, I'm kicked out, I don't have a job, I let everybody down. The nightmare would continue years after graduating. I woke up covered in sweat, panicked, slowly coming to and remembering that it was a dream, that I did end up graduating and my life continued. Just as academics felt like survival, so did finding internships. Trying to write a resume and get a job four months into school was comedic. The job hunt was a performance we all had to take part in. Employers knew we had no real experience, but we competed anyway-padding resumes, grasping for any edge over classmates. I sent out over 400 applications, received a handful of interviews and finally landed an offer. But on the day I was supposed to start, I got an email stating the company had no money to pay me and therefore closed the position. Just like that, it was gone. I ended up back at my high school job as an electrician, something Waterloo approved without hesitation - because in 2008, they knew how brutal the market was. The journey was one of the biggest emotional roller coasters of my life. Filled with self-doubt, I'd look to seniors for reassurance. They'd always say, \"It gets easier\". I took that to mean the environment would soften, but that wasn't the case. Every year, familiar faces disappeared-some dropped out, others failed. A year in school felt like a round of Squid Game - relentless, high-stakes and unforgiving. You never knew who would make it to the next stage. It's didn't get easier, I just get better at playing the game. I figured out learning strategies that work for me. I stop going to class and just locked myself in the library before exams. My anxiety would fuel my rise in grades with little to no love for the subject. I learned to grind and when stress got high, we drank. It took many years to unwind my alcohol use as my coping mechanism. Some of my friends never did. Yet despite everything-the brutal workload, the fear, the constant pressure - those years remain one of my favorite chapters of my life. The struggle forged the strongest relationships I have to this day, 15 years later. And for a long time after graduating, I found myself wanting to go back. For those of you that are in the middle of it, stay strong and keep going. Lean in and lean on each other. Learn, struggle, celebrate, fail and get back up. This time in your life will shape you in ways you won't understand until much later. And when you finally do, you'll look back and know-it was worth it. I believe in you.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"In brief: It hasn't been a good week for Tesla as U.S. safety regulators issued a recall for nearly all Cybertrucks on the road. In an effort to stabilize morale, CEO Elon Musk held an unconventional meeting to reassure employees and address the company's challenges, including a significant decline in stock price.  The move marks the eighth safety-related recall for the Tesla-made vehicles since deliveries began just over a year ago. Initiated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the recall affects more than 46,000 Cybertrucks and primarily relates to an issue with an exterior panel that can detach while driving. The problematic panel, known as a cant rail assembly, is located between the windshield and the roof on both sides of the vehicle. It is secured using a structural adhesive, but the current adhesive is susceptible to environmental degradation. To address this issue, Tesla will replace the panel with a new adhesive that is more resilient and add additional reinforcements. The recall covers all 2024 and 2025 model years, manufactured from November 13, 2023, to February 27, 2025. Tesla became aware of the problem early this year. Owner notification letters are expected to be mailed on May 19, 2025. This latest recall is part of a series of setbacks for Tesla, which has faced multiple safety issues with the Cybertruck, including faults in electric inverters and stuck acceleration pedals. Tesla all-hands live presentation https:\/\/t.co\/jQOt6WB2LN Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk is working to reassure employees amid a tumultuous period for the company. Following a significant decline in Tesla's stock price \u2013 more than 50 percent over the past three months \u2013 Musk addressed employees in a surprise all-hands meeting at Tesla's Texas Gigafactory, urging them to remain optimistic about the company's future. He acknowledged the current challenges, admitting that \"it feels like Armageddon\" when reading news about the company, including instances of vandalism and protests targeting Tesla vehicles and dealerships. He said that Teslas will soon be capable of driving autonomously, a promise he has made as far back as 2016. Musk encouraged employees to hold on to their stock, pointing out the company's potential for innovation and growth.  \"What I'm saying is hang on to your stock... There are times when there are rocky moments, but what I'm here to tell you is that the future is incredibly bright and exciting, and we're going to do things that no one has even dreamed of,\" he said during the meeting. Musk's message was met with mixed reactions from employees. Some felt reassured by his optimism and commitment to Tesla's mission, while others were skeptical, viewing the event as a publicity stunt or questioning the alignment of Musk's political involvement with Tesla's goals. The meeting was notable not only for its content but also for its unconventional timing and format. Typically, Tesla holds all-hands meetings during regular work hours, but this event was livestreamed on Musk's social media platform X, starting late in the evening. His words seemed to have a positive impact, though, as Tesla shares rose slightly following the stream.

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"One of the core problems with AI is the notoriously high power and computing demand, especially for tasks such as media generation. On mobile phones, when it comes to running natively, only a handful of pricey devices with powerful silicon can run the feature suite. Even when implemented at scale on cloud, it\u2019s a pricey affair. Nvidia may have quietly addressed that challenge in partnership with the folks over at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Tsinghua University. The team created a hybrid AI image generation tool called HART (hybrid autoregressive transformer) that essentially combines two of the most widely used AI image creation techniques. The result is a blazing fast tool with dramatically lower compute requirement. Just to give you an idea of just how fast it is, I asked it to create an image of a parrot playing a bass guitar. It returned with the following picture in just about a second. I could barely even follow the progress bar. When I pushed the same prompt before Google\u2019s Imagen 3 model in Gemini, it took roughly 9-10 seconds on a 200 Mbps internet connection. When AI images first started making waves, the diffusion technique was behind it all, powering products such as OpenAI\u2019s Dall-E image generator, Google\u2019s Imagen, and Stable Diffusion. This method can produce images with an extremely high level of detail. However, it is a multi-step approach to creating AI images, and as a result, it is slow and computationally expensive.  The second approach that has recently gained popularity is auto-regressive models, which essentially work in the same fashion as chatbots and generate images using a pixel prediction technique. It is faster, but also a more error-prone method of creating images using AI. The team at MIT fused both methods into a single package called HART. It relies on an autoregression model to predict compressed image assets as a discrete token, while a small diffusion model handles the rest to compensate for the quality loss. The overall approach reduces the number of steps involved from over two dozen to eight steps.  The experts behind HART claim that it can \u201cgenerate images that match or exceed the quality of state-of-the-art diffusion models, but do so about nine times faster.\u201d HART combines an autoregressive model with a 700 million parameter range and a small diffusion model that can handle 37 million parameters. Interestingly, this hybrid tool was able to create images that matched the quality of top-shelf models with a 2 billion parameter capacity. Most importantly, HART was able to achieve that milestone at a nine times faster image generation rate, while requiring 31% less computation resources. As per the team, the low-compute approach allows HART to run locally on phones and laptops, which is a huge win. So far, the most popular mass-market products such as ChatGPT and Gemini require an internet connection for image generation as the computing happens in the cloud servers.  In the test video, the team showcased it running natively on an MSI laptop with Intel\u2019s Core series processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX graphics card. That\u2019s a combination you can find on a majority of gaming laptops out there, without spending a fortune, while at it. HART is capable of producing 1:1 aspect ratio images at a respectable 1024 x 1024 pixels resolution. The level of detail in these images is impressive, and so is the stylistic variation and scenery accuracy. During their tests, the team noted that the hybrid AI tool was anywhere between three to six times faster and offered over seven times higher throughput.  The future potential is exciting, especially when integrating HART\u2019s image capabilities with language models. \u201cIn the future, one could interact with a unified vision-language generative model, perhaps by asking it to show the intermediate steps required to assemble a piece of furniture,\u201d says the team at MIT.  They are already exploring that idea, and even plan to test the HART approach at audio and video generation. You can try it out on MIT\u2019s web dashboard.  Before we dive into the quality debate, do keep in mind that HART is very much a research project that is still in its early stages. On the technical side, there are a few hassles highlighted by the team, such as overheads during the inference and training process. The challenges can be fixed or overlooked, because they are minor in the bigger scheme of things here. Moreover, considering the sheer benefits HART delivers in terms of computing efficiency, speed, and latency, they might just persist without leading to any major performance issues.  In my brief time prompt-testing HART, I was astonished by the pace of image generation. I barely ran into a scenario where the free web tool took more than two seconds to create an image. Even with prompts that span three paragraphs (roughly over 200 words in length), HART was able to create images that adhere tightly to the description. Aside from descriptive accuracy, there was plenty of detail in the images. However, HART suffers from the typical failings of an AI image generator tool. It struggles with digits, basic depictions like eating food items, character consistency, and failing at perspective capture.  Photorealism in human context is one area where I noticed glaring failures. On a few occasions, it simply got the concept of basic objects wrong, like confusing a ring with a necklace. But overall, those errors were far, few, and fundamentally expected. A healthy bunch of AI tools still can\u2019t get that right, despite being out there for a while now.  Overall, I am particularly excited by the immense potential of HART. It would be interesting to see whether MIT and Nvidia create a product out of it, or simply adopt the hybrid AI image generation approach in an existing product. Either way, it\u2019s a glimpse into a very promising future.  An empty Maserati MC20 driven by an AI system recently set a new speed record for an autonomous vehicle, reaching a blistering 197.7 mph (318 kph) at Space Florida's Launch and Landing Facility at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Footage of the achievement (above) shows the self-driving Maserati MC20 hurtling down the runway once used for Space Shuttle landings, with the speedometer gradually ticking all the way up to the record-breaking speed. Update: A Google spokesperson responded to our queries. The story has been updated with their answers in a dedicated section below.\u00a0 Google is pushing forward with more AI into how internet search works. Remember AI Overviews, which essentially summarizes the content pulled from websites, and presents it at the top of the Google Search page? OpenAI released its Sora text-to-video generation tool late in 2024, and expanded it to the European market at the end of February this year. It seems the next avenue for Sora is the ChatGPT app. According to a TechCrunch report, which cites internal conversations, OpenAI is planning to bring the video creation AI tool to ChatGPT. So far, the video generator has been available only via a web client, and has remained exclusive to paid users.

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"Over the past couple years, we have learned that AI can boost the productivity of individual knowledge workers ranging from consultants to lawyers to coders. But most knowledge work isn\u2019t purely an individual activity; it happens in groups and teams. And teams aren't just collections of individuals \u2013 they provide critical benefits that individuals alone typically can't, including better performance, sharing of expertise, and social connections.  So, what happens when AI acts as a teammate? This past summer we conducted a pre-registered, randomized controlled trial of 776 professionals at Procter and Gamble, the consumer goods giant, to find out. We are ready to share the results in a new working paper: The Cybernetic Teammate: A Field Experiment on Generative AI Reshaping Teamwork and Expertise. Given the scale of this project, it shouldn\u2019t be a surprise that this paper was a massive team effort coordinated by the Digital Data Design Institute at Harvard and led by Fabrizio Dell\u2019Acqua, Charles Ayoubi, and Karim Lakhani, along with Hila Lifshitz, Raffaella Sadun, Lilach Mollick, me, and our partners at Procter and Gamble: Yi Han, Jeff Goldman, Hari Nair, and Stewart Taub.  We wanted this experiment to be a test of real-world AI use, so we were able to replicate the product development process at P&G, thanks to the cooperation and help of the company (which had no control over the results or data). To do that, we ran one-day workshops where professionals from Europe and the US had to actually develop product ideas, packaging, retail strategies and other tasks for the business units they really worked for, which included baby products, feminine care, grooming, and oral care. Teams with the best ideas had them submitted to management for approval, so there were some real stakes involved. We also had two kinds of professionals in our experiment: commercial experts and technical R&D experts. They were generally very experienced, with over 10 years of work at P&G alone. We randomly created teams consisting of one person in each specialty. Half were given GPT-4 or GPT-4o to use, and half were not. We also picked a random set of both types of specialists to work alone, and gave half of them access to AI. Everyone assigned to the AI condition was given a training session and a set of prompts they could use or modify. This design allowed us to isolate the effects of AI and teamwork independently and in combination. We measured outcomes across multiple dimensions including solution quality (as determined by at least two expert judges per solution), time spent, and participants' emotional responses. What we found was interesting. When working without AI, teams outperformed individuals by a significant amount, 0.24 standard deviations (providing a sigh of relief for every teacher and manager who has pushed the value of teamwork). But the surprise came when we looked at AI-enabled participants. Individuals working with AI performed just as well as teams without AI, showing a 0.37 standard deviation improvement over the baseline. This suggests that AI effectively replicated the performance benefits of having a human teammate \u2013 one person with AI could match what previously required two-person collaboration. Teams with AI performed best overall with a 0.39 standard deviation improvement, though the difference between individuals with AI and teams with AI wasn't statistically significant. But we found an interesting pattern when looking at truly exceptional solutions, those ranking in the top 10% of quality. Teams using AI were significantly more likely to produce these top-tier solutions, suggesting that there is value in having human teams working on a problem that goes beyond the value of working with AI alone. Both AI-enabled groups also worked much faster, saving 12-16% of the time spent by non-AI groups while producing solutions that were substantially longer and more detailed than those from non-AI groups. Without AI, we saw clear professional silos in how people approached problems. R&D specialists consistently proposed technically-oriented solutions while Commercial specialists suggested market-focused ideas. When these specialists worked together in teams without AI, they produced more balanced solutions through their cross-functional collaboration (teamwork wins again!). But this was another place AI made a big difference. When paired with AI, both R&D and Commercial professionals, in teams or when working alone, produced balanced solutions that integrated both technical and commercial perspectives. The distinction between specialists virtually disappeared in AI-aided conditions, as you can see in the graph. We saw a similar effect on teams. This effect was especially pronounced for employees less familiar with product development. Without AI, these less experienced employees performed relatively poorly even in teams. But with AI assistance, they suddenly performed at levels comparable to teams that included experienced members. AI effectively helped people bridge functional knowledge gaps, allowing them to think and create beyond their specialized training, and helped amateurs act more like experts. A particularly surprising finding was how AI affected the emotional experience of work. Technological change, and especially AI, has often been associated with reduced workplace satisfaction and increased stress. But our results showed the opposite, at least in this case. People using AI reported significantly higher levels of positive emotions (excitement, energy, and enthusiasm) compared to those working without AI. They also reported lower levels of negative emotions like anxiety and frustration. Individuals working with AI had emotional experiences comparable to or better than those working in human teams.  While we conducted a thorough study that involved a pre-registered randomized controlled trial, there are always caveats to these sorts of studies. For example, it is possible that larger teams would show very different results when working with AI, or that working with AI for longer projects may impact its value. It is also possible that our results represent a lower bound: all of these experiments were conducted with GPT-4 or GPT-4o, less capable models than what are available today; the participants did not have a lot of prompting experience so they may not have gotten as much benefit; and chatbots are not really built for teamwork. There is a lot more detail on all of this in the paper, but limitations aside, the bigger question might be: why does this all matter? Organizations have primarily viewed AI as just another productivity tool, like a better calculator or spreadsheet. This made sense initially but has become increasingly limiting as models get better and as recent data finds users most often employ AI for critical thinking and complex problem solving, not just routine productivity tasks. Companies that focus solely on efficiency gains from AI will not only find workers unwilling to share their AI discoveries for fear of making themselves redundant but will also miss the opportunity to think bigger about the future of work.  To successfully use AI, organizations will need to change their analogies. Our findings suggest AI sometimes functions more like a teammate than a tool. While not human, it replicates core benefits of teamwork\u2014improved performance, expertise sharing, and positive emotional experiences. This teammate perspective should make organizations think differently about AI. It suggests a need to reconsider team structures, training programs, and even traditional boundaries between specialties. At least with the current set of AI tools, AI augments human capabilities. It democratizes expertise as well, enabling more employees to contribute meaningfully to specialized tasks and potentially opening new career pathways. The most exciting implication may be that AI doesn't just automate existing tasks, it changes how we can think about work itself. The future of work isn't just about individuals adapting to AI, it's about organizations reimagining the fundamental nature of teamwork and management structures themselves. And that's a challenge that will require not just technological solutions, but new organizational thinking. Leave a comment  This is 100% my experience. The last couple of months have been the most productive in my career, and it isn\u2019t even close. My concern with this observation is that we are potentially entering a productivity divide between those who utilize AI properly and those who do not. And this is not just an AI literacy question, it is primarily also a question of attitude towards the benefits of AI. If you are rejecting AI as a matter of principle you will no longer be able to compete, even if you are the smartest person in the room. What I find significant is that this study is done before the use of the new \u201cdeep research \u201c methodologies were realized.  I am \u201cteaming\u201d with a combination of Gemini, OpenAI, and Claude using deep research and doing mashups of results.  And now I am integrating this with my human team members and teaching them the technologies.  The results are spectacular.  We are using this technology to design, architect, project plan, and build and it is hard to describe the results.  As new features appear we are folding them into our processes.  GPT 4o results which used to stun me are now pedestrian in comparison. No posts Ready for more?","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Published onMarch 22, 2025 In less than a month, Apple and Google both released their newest budget smartphones for 2025. Apple has the iPhone 16e, while Google has the Pixel 9a. At first glance, the phones are similar enough. They\u2019re both the cheapest value offering for their flagship siblings, have a big focus on AI features, and have similar price tags. There\u2019s an argument to be made for each phone. If you need to be in Apple\u2019s ecosystem but don\u2019t want to pay $799 or $999 for an iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Pro, the iPhone 16e gives you all the essentials (with a decent splash of Apple Intelligence) for $599. The Google Pixel 9a is the same type of phone for people who prefer Android, standing in as a lower-cost alternative to the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro with capable specs and its own AI goodies \u2014 all for just $499. While the sum of the iPhone 16e and Pixel 9a may be identical, the parts they consist of are where things get very different. Each phone attempts to do the same thing, but when you look at them side by side and think about what each is giving you for your money, the Pixel 9a quickly highlights how bad of a value the iPhone 16e really is. From a hardware perspective, the Pixel 9a and iPhone 16e have a few things in common. Each one has an aluminum frame, an IP68 dust\/water resistance rating, and a 48MP primary camera. Both phones also support wireless charging and wired charge speeds of around 20W. But it\u2019s with the rest of the spec sheet where things fall apart for the iPhone. It starts with the display. I love how compact the iPhone 16e\u2019s 6.1-inch screen is, and it being an OLED panel is great, too. But you know what\u2019s not great? Having an outdated 60Hz refresh rate and a measly peak brightness of just 1200 nits. Meanwhile, the Pixel 9a also has an OLED panel and pairs it with a 120Hz refresh rate with up to 2700 nits of peak brightness \u2014 meaning it has much smoother animations and a lot more brightness for outdoor visibility. So far, not a great start for the iPhone. What about cameras? There\u2019s a big disparity there, too. As I mentioned above, both phones have a 48MP primary camera sensor on the back, though the Pixel sports a larger physical sensor for more light and details. Also, in the case of the iPhone 16e, that\u2019s the only rear camera it has. Comparatively, the Google Pixel 9a has an extra 13MP ultrawide camera with a 120-degree field of view. Is it the best ultrawide sensor on the market? No, but it still allows for a much greater level of shooting flexibility than what\u2019s possible on the iPhone 16e. Battery capacity is another thing to look at. The iPhone 16e\u2019s battery capacity is a little over 3,900mAh. The Pixel 9a\u2019s battery size? 5,100mAh. We still need to test the Pixel 9a for ourselves to see just how good its battery life really is, but at least on paper, that\u2019s a big advantage in the Pixel\u2019s favor. Finally, there are a lot of other quality-of-life aspects where the Pixel 9a continues to best Apple\u2019s budget iPhone. The Pixel 9a has a USB-C 3.2 port and Wi-Fi 6E connectivity. Further, in addition to its under-display fingerprint sensor, it also has the same excellent face unlock as the regular Pixel 9\/9 Pro, allowing you to unlock sensitive apps and authenticate Google Wallet purchases using just your face. The iPhone 16e, by comparison, has a slower USB-C 2.0 port, the slightly older Wi-Fi 6 standard, and just Face ID for biometric security. Of course, there is a counterargument to all of this. The iPhone 16e isn\u2019t trying to be a spec powerhouse. Instead, Apple\u2019s main goal with the phone is to offer its Apple Intelligence suite on a lower-cost handset. In that regard, the iPhone 16e is a success. It\u2019s the cheapest phone in Apple\u2019s current lineup with all the Apple Intelligence features you\u2019d expect \u2014 including Writing Tools, phone call and recording transcripts, Genmoji, Image Playground, and the improved Siri. That\u2019s a fair point, but there\u2019s a counter to that counterargument: the Google Pixel 9a achieves the exact same thing. The Pixel 9a supports most of the Pixel-exclusive features we\u2019ve come to expect over the years, such as the Pixel Recorder app, all of the Call Assist tools, and more. It also has Circle to Search, the Pixel Studio app, Gemini Live, Google\u2019s usual suite of AI photo editing tools, and so on. Simply put, the iPhone 16e and Pixel 9a are both \u201cAI phones.\u201d If the argument is that Apple had to sacrifice so many hardware specs to deliver its AI features, that doesn\u2019t hold much weight when the Pixel 9a is equally capable on the AI front \u2014 if not more so \u2014 and still manages to one-up so many of the iPhone 16e\u2019s specs while also costing $100 less. On their own, some of the spec differences highlighted above may not matter to you. I prefer a 120Hz refresh rate, but you might be OK with a 60Hz one. A newer Wi-Fi standard and a faster USB-C port are nice, but they aren\u2019t the end-all-be-all. The problem with the iPhone 16e isn\u2019t just one or two spec compromises like that. It\u2019s the fact that the iPhone 16e has so many of them that the Google Pixel 9a does not, all while costing $100 more. And as we just covered above, the iPhone 16e can\u2019t lean on its AI features as a crutch to explain these shortcomings. If you\u2019re knee-deep in the Apple ecosystem, features like iMessage, Apple Watch support, and AirDrop are still things you can only get on an iPhone. In that case, the iPhone 16e probably makes the most sense as the phone you should buy. But even so, it\u2019s important to be aware of the other options out there. To someone who\u2019s only shopping for or looking at iPhones, the iPhone 16e can seem like a good value. But that changes the second you bring a phone like the Google Pixel 9a into the equation. The Pixel 9a proves you can make an AI-capable phone with good hardware, modern specs, and a price tag under $500, while the iPhone 16e may lead you to believe that\u2019s impossible. The Pixel 9a is a better deal than the iPhone 16e in almost every conceivable way, and if I were in the market for a $500-$600 phone today, the Pixel is the one I would choose. Hands down.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"With a bit of a lull in Apple product news following the launches of the latest Mac, iPad, and iPhone updates for early 2025, attention is turning back to rumors about other upcoming products with the all-new \"iPhone 17 Air\" for later this year and even next year's iPhone 18 Pro seeing some recent rumors. Apple is also still getting attention for its delay announcement around the forthcoming Siri update based on Apple Intelligence, with the company seeking to generate some fresh energy for the project by bringing in new leadership, so read on below for all the details on these stories and more!  Rumors and leaks indicate we're getting a new iPhone model this year, with an \"iPhone 17 Air\" replacing the Plus model that's been in the lineup for past several years and coming in at around the same $899 starting price point. While the device is expected to have an impressively thin and light design, rumors suggest it will have some compromises compared to iPhone 17 Pro models, including only a single rear camera, a single speaker, and an A19 chip instead of a more powerful A19 Pro chip. The iPhone 17 Air will reportedly include a 6.6-inch display, and while Apple reportedly prototyped a larger model with a 6.9-inch screen, the company is said to have decided against it due to concerns over an ultra-thin form factor at that size being susceptible to bending.  Fallout from delays to a Siri revamp powered by Apple Intelligence and subsequent criticisms of some of the company's actions continues to mount, with Apple moving to shift responsibility for Siri from its AI chief John Giannandrea to former Vision Pro boss Mike Rockwell in an effort to shake things up. The move comes as the current version of Siri is under renewed criticism for its difficulties handling even some of the most basic queries. Prominent industry analyst Benedict Evans wonders if the Apple Intelligence issues and the push to bring Vision Pro to market are a sign of Apple experiencing a \"Vista-like drift into systemically poor execution\" similar to what Microsoft went through with Windows nearly 20 years ago.  Apple is known to have been investing large sums of money into Apple TV+ in an effort to expand its services business, but it's never been revealed how well the service is performing for Apple. A new report from The Information claims that Apple TV+ has around 45 million subscribers worldwide, making it a small player in the streaming video market, and that the service is losing roughly $1 billion per year. Apple has reportedly been trying to tighten up the purse strings a bit to move closer to breaking even on Apple TV+, but it's not the only Apple service that's not exactly pulling its weight in the high-margin services sector, as Apple Music interest seems to be plateauing while Apple News+, Apple Arcade, and Apple Fitness+ are also not seeing significant growth.  We're still nearly six months away from the official unveiling of the iPhone 17 lineup, but that doesn't mean the rumor mill isn't already looking beyond to the 2026 models. For Apple's high-end iPhone 18 Pro models, rumors have suggested we could see under-display Face ID for a much smaller Dynamic Island, a variable aperture main camera, Apple's next-generation C2 cellular modem, and an A20 chip with upgrades to benefit Apple Intelligence.  Apple has been rumored to be working on several foldable devices, with a foldable iPhone potentially being the first one out the door in late 2026 or early 2027. Based on supply chain checks, Barclays analyst Tim Long believes the device could start at around $2,300, representing a huge premium over Apple's traditional flagship phones. A larger foldable device may not be far behind, but will it be considered a Mac or an iPad? It may largely come down to whether its operating system is built off of iPadOS or macOS, with analyst Jeff Pu believing it will be a flavor of macOS.

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"Watch CBS News  Updated on:  March 21, 2025 \/ 8:30 PM EDT           \/ CBS News          Los Angeles \u2014 With a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and vehicle parts from Canada and Mexico set to take effect on April 2 as part of President Trump's trade wars, car shoppers are unsure about whether to buy now or risk facing higher prices later.  Even after 20 years of selling cars, general manager Brandon Wishengrad still can't predict how impending tariffs will impact prices at his family's Nissan dealership in Los Angeles.  Wishengrad admits he doesn't know what to say to customers about whether prices could change.  \"It's tough to say,\" Wishengrad said. \"At the moment, I think we know just as much as anybody else does.\"\u00a0 The average cost of a new car could increase anywhere from $3,500 to $10,000 if the tariffs take effect, according to estimates from the Anderson Economic Group. That potential uptick also depends on where the parts come from.  Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds, says it is a spreadsheet nightmare.  \"A lot of the vehicles are final-assembled in the United States, but get engines, transmissions from Mexico and Canada,\" Caldwell explained. \"\u2026If you look across the entire industry, there's nothing that's 100% American.\" Mr. Trump' 25% tariffs took effect March 4, but one day later, he issued a one-month reprieve to U.S. automakers after talking to leaders from the Big Three automakers: Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. Then on March 6, he also issued a pause until Apr 2 on all imports from Canada and Mexico that are covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Caldwell says that she suspects that in \"many cases\" automakers probably do not yet know what the tariffs will cost them.  \"Especially things like, if a part does cross the border eight times,\" Caldwell added.  She notes that while automakers \"can build factories here in the United States, it's just going to take time.\" In the meantime, Caldwell says anyone who drives a car should prepare to pay more.  \u00a0 \"It's not just people buying vehicles, I think anybody that is having to repair their vehicle or just service their vehicle are gonna experience higher costs as well,\" Caldwell said.  When it comes to new cars, Caldwell believes buyer incentives and other discounts will be among the first to disappear. \u00a0 \"So if someone is looking to buy a new vehicle in the next few months, I'd say probably do it sooner rather than later,\" Caldwell said. \"We don't know if the tariffs will go through ultimately, but if you can't afford to take that gamble, I think it's probably best to err on the side of caution.\"  Wishengrad agrees that the back-and-forth about the trade war has become white noise for consumers. \"I do think so, eventually, you know, people start to tune that out.\"\u00a0 Carter Evans has served as a Los Angeles-based correspondent for CBS News since February 2013, reporting across all of the network's platforms.

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"ByMaury Brown  ByMaury Brown,  Senior Contributor.  Fan growth continues to surge with Formula 1, led by China. (Photo by WU HAO \/ POOL \/ AFP) (Photo by ... More WU HAO\/POOL\/AFP via Getty Images) As the 2025 Formula 1 season gets underway, new data released by Nielsen Sports indicates a significant increase in fan interest in the global racing series. Entering the 75th anniversary season for F1, the increased parity on the grid during the 2024 season with the rise of McLaren in the Constructor\u2019s Championship, and a variety of drivers not named Max Verstappen getting wins, fan growth surged. According to Nielsen Sports, Formula 1 now has a global fanbase of 826.5 million, an increase of 90 million over the 2023 season. In the U.S., the market increased by +10.5% over 2023 adding nearly 90 million new fans. That follows a +10.5% growth in the market to 52 million fans between 2023 and 2024. With the Chinese Grand Prix back on the schedule, China led global growth with a +39% increase in fans over the last 12 months. Other key growth markets include Canada (+31.5%), Argentina (+25.5%), and Saudi Arabia (+25.5%), According to Formula One Group CEO Stefano Domenicali, race events saw strong attendance trends continue throughout the season the 2024 with 17 sellout crowds and 10 new attendance records. Over 6.5 million people attended races in 2024. A new record, growing +9% over 2023. Consumption of Formula 1 \u2013 both on television and digital via platforms \u2013 continues to grow. According to Nielsen Sports, there was a cumulative increase of +10% for the 2024 season on television. In The U.S., while overall viewership was ostensibly flat year-over-year between 2023 and 2024 on ESPN, seven races saw viewership records set domestically (Miami, Monaco, Canada, British, Italian, Qatar, Abu Dhabi), with Miami leading the way with an average audience of 3.1 million. According to ESPN, 11 races saw year-over-year viewership gains over 2023 (Japan, Miami, Monaco, Canada, Spain, British, Hungary, Dutch, Italian, Qatar, Abu Dhabi). Digitally, YouTube highlights globally of F1 saw an additional 233 million views, particularly in the U.S. (31.5 million), U.K. (25 million), and India (13 million). \"Formula 1\u2019s growth reflects its growing global appeal. With a more competitive season in 2024 and key markets like the U.S., China, and Brazil experiencing year-over-year fan growth, F1 continues to strengthen its position as a truly global sport,\u2019 said Jon Stainer, Global GM at Nielsen Sports. \u201cThe 2025 season, marking the 75th anniversary, presents a major opportunity for brands to align with this momentum and engage with an increasingly diverse and engaged fanbase.\" The question is, how much of this growth can be attributed to the Netflix series Drive To Survive, or has the U.S. finally organically entrenched itself in the sport? In a statement by Formula 1 for Forbes, they said DTS certainly had an impact and continues to be very popular, but that F1\u2019s major investment and strategic changes have been done to support U.S. market growth. \u201cSince 2017 we have gone from 1 race to 3 in the U.S., including Las Vegas where we have a permanent presence with Grand Prix Plaza,\u201d Formula 1 said in the statement to Forbes. \u201cSocial media was opened up, with drivers and teams all having a significant presence, inviting our fans behind the scenes all year round. The US is now our largest market for social media followers. We have also focused on creating opportunities for fans to engage away from track, including F1 Arcade which has a number of US properties, and will expand further in years to come.\u201d Data provided by Nielsen Sports comes from Nielsen Sports\u2019 F1 Audience Measurement Data (2024), and Nielsen Fan Insights (NFI), which surveyed the opinions and interests of 44,000 respondents across 37 international markets.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"BySimon Moore  BySimon Moore,  Senior Contributor.  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference after the Federal Open Market ... More Committee meeting, Wednesday, March 19, 2025, at the Federal Reserve in Washington. The Fed is expected most likely likely cut interest rates again in June. (AP Photo\/Jacquelyn Martin) The next interest rate cut will most likely come in June, according to fixed income markets. The Federal Open Market Committee has held interest rates steady at meetings in January and March. The pause in interest rate cuts has primarily been due to waiting for further progress on disinflation at a time when the job market appears robust. However, economic uncertainty has risen, clouding the outlook for monetary policy. The FOMC sees elevated uncertainty in the economic outlook. Policymaker forecasts imply an average of two cuts in 2025, as updated on March 19. Importantly, despite the average expectation of two cuts remaining the same, the range of outcomes from policymakers is now skewed to fewer cuts than in December projections. Interest rate cuts could come if inflation cools further and the jobs market remains robust. Though policymakers do apparently see tariffs creating some inflation in 2025 on their recent projections. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell commented on inflation saying, \u201cSome near-term measures of inflation expectations have recently moved up.\" At his March 19 press conference. Powell continued. \"We see this in both market- and survey-based measures, and survey respondents, both consumers and businesses, are mentioning tariffs as a driving factor. Beyond the next year or so, however, most measures of longer-term expectations remain consistent with our 2% inflation goal.\u201d Recession fears, which have increased somewhat based on survey data, could also trigger rate cuts. Despite recession fears, reported economic data has been broadly positive. Forecasting site Kalshi, puts the chance of a 2025 recession at 36%. Powell did not suggest interest rate cuts were imminent at his March 19 press conference. Rather, he emphasized considerable economic uncertainty. Often policymakers will hint a cut is coming at the next meeting to help manage expectations. Without evidence of that, fixed income markets give only a 16% chance of a May 7 cut in interest rates. However, markets are confident that the FOMC will cut interest rates by June 18 giving a 78% chance that short-term interest rates are below their current level of 4.25% to 4.5% by then, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. For 2025 as a whole, fixed income markets see between two and four interest cuts as likely. In contrast, FOMC policymakers\u2019 projections imply a different view, implying two cuts as the most likely outcome with fewer cuts possible. Powell suggested that the lack of change in the interest rate forecast might be due to inertia in the face of uncertainty, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to see how things actually work out. And the fact that there wasn\u2019t much change, I think that's partly because, you know, you see weaker growth but higher inflation, they kind of offset. And also, frankly, a little bit of inertia when it comes to changing something in this highly uncertain environment, you know, I think there is a level of inertia where you just say, maybe I'll stay where I am.\u201d With assessments of economic uncertainty at very high levels compared to recent history, much will depend on how economic data plays out. There are rising fears of recession. For example, economic research from UCLA published in March suggested that, \u201ca downturn could result over the coming year or two.\u201d This assessment argues that the impact of tariff levels perhaps rising to a level not seen in a century could lead to supply chain dislocation. Government spending cuts, too, may dampen demand. Lastly, immigration policies could reduce labor supply with particular impacts on the construction and agricultural sectors. Consumer confidence has also declined in recent surveys. However, reported economic data remains generally robust. For example, jobless claims as reported on March 20, remain consistent with levels over the past two years. In addition, the unemployment rate was reported as 4.1% for February, this rate has remained in a narrow band of between 4% and 4.2% since May 2024 and is not at historically elevated levels. That said, it may take until perhaps May or later for the economic impact of recent policy changes to be fully assessed in reported economic data. For now, the FOMC is projecting two interest rate cuts for 2025, with the first perhaps coming in June. However, economic uncertainty is high, and the fixed income markets see a reasonable chance of deeper interest rate cuts. The FOMC often stresses that its actions are data dependent, but that will be particularly true of the coming months as there is considerable divergence of economic forecasts.","label":0}

(Unsplash: Phil Cruz) Move over gin, distillers say rum is next in line for a resurgence. The number of Australian spirit makers has exploded from around 30 in 2013 to more than 700 today. Around half of those are in regional areas, and the latest addition to the list is at Muswellbrook in the NSW Hunter Valley, in the town's former milk factory. Steve Magarry and Jonny Croft from Sydney Rum Distillery will produce rum at the old Oak factory. (Supplied) Steve Magarry is the chief executive of the Sydney Rum Distillery, which is in the process of transforming the 1940s-built former Oak milk factory into a rum distillery.The Oak factory closed in 1994 and has since hosted wine and spirits companies, but has been sitting idle since 2019. \"The focus for us is to utilise the existing assets, reuse and upgrade what's already here.\" Once at full production, Mr Magarry said the distillery would produce 1.5 to 2 million litres of rum and brandy each year, with much of it destined for the international market. \"We're looking to be the second largest rum producer in the south pacific region,\" he said. The historic Muswellbrook Oak factory was built in the 1940s. (ABC Upper Hunter: Sean Murphy) Australian Distillers Association CEO Paul McLeay said with global interest growing, now is the time for Australia to push its spirits further. Mr McLeay said domestically, the spirits industry is worth more than $15 billion. \"We have 5,500 jobs in direct manufacturing and we support a supply chain of over 100,000,\" he said. \"We know that within the decade we can be a $1 billion export industry if we get the policy settings right.\" The community was recently invited to tour the old factory. (Supplied) The Upper Hunter is bracing for thousands of jobs to be lost from the coal industry in decades to come, including more than 10,000 by 2030 as Mount Arthur and Mangoola mines near Muswellbrook close down. Muswellbrook Shire mayor Jeff Drayton said the distillery is a perfect example of how the region could welcome new industries. \"This is exactly the type of industry [we want]; you need an industry that will be a drawcard for the town,\" he said. Long before mining, the Upper Hunter was \"bred on dairy farming\". Jeff Wolfgang's family ran a dairy for 90 years and he remembers when the Oak factory first opened in the 1950s. The Muswellbrook Oak factory used local milk in its products. (ABC Archive) Not only did it take fresh milk, but it also processed milk to powder, which Mr Wolfgang said was a huge step forward for local dairy farmers. \"In a good season, everybody's cows gave a lot more milk and we didn't know what to do with it,\" he said. In those days, it would be separated on farm and the milk fed to the Wolfgangs' pigs. As an avid historian, Mr Wolfgang is excited for the building to reopen. \"It's a new industry for the district, it's a beautiful building there \u2026 it's a landmark.\" Topic:Public Sector Topic:Stock Market Topic:Liberal Party of Australia Topic:Political Leadership Topic:Universities Topic:Agricultural Crops Topic:Alcohol Topic:Food and Beverage Processing Industry Alcoholic Drinks Careers Dairy Farming Exports Food and Beverage Processing Industry Hospitality Industry Muswellbrook Newcastle Topic:Public Sector Topic:Stock Market Topic:Liberal Party of Australia Topic:Political Leadership Topic:Universities Topic:World Politics Topic:Religious Leaders Topic:Public Sector Topic:Liberal Party of Australia We acknowledge Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the First Australians and Traditional Custodians of the lands where we live, learn, and work.

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"The agency repping The Texas Chainsaw Massacre rights since 2017, Verve, is fielding a flurry of attention as they quietly shop around one of horror\u2019s most enduring and blood-soaked IPs. As the theatrical market becomes increasingly reliant on established franchises, especially horror, it\u2019s not surprising that studios and filmmakers are sharpening their chainsaws. Verve confirmed to Deadline: \u201cVerve represents The Texas Chainsaw Massacre estate and is building out a multimedia strategy for the seminal horror franchise.\u201d They also added: \u201cVerve has not officially submitted the property into any filmmakers, producers or buyers. Because this is such a hot and iconic horror property, packages are pre-emptively being brought to Verve.\u201d One early pairing is Strange Darling filmmaker JT Mollner and producer Roy Lee. Their recent indie thriller was a great flick, and it pulled in $3 million and boasts a 96% Rotten Tomatoes score.  Supposedly, if Mollner gets a script together, Top Gun: Maverick\u2019s Glen Powell wants to read it. It's early days, but a Mollner-Powell team-up could make for an interesting parternership with a franchise like this.  Word is that Lionsgate, A24, and others are also sniffing around along with Neon, who is hot off the success of Longlegs, The Monkey, and their upcoming film Keeper, this could be their next big horror swing for them. Exurbia Films is the production company behind the scenes, with Pat Cassidy, Ian Henkel, and Kim Henkel producing. The estate is represented by attorney Marios Rush. This is one of those franchises just won\u2019t die. It was born from the twisted minds of Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel, the original 1974 film was a guerrilla production and shot in 100-degree heat with unknown actors for $140,000 and a script loosely inspired by real-life killers like Ed Gein and Elmer Wayne Henley.  That movie messed me up when I first watched it and none of the other films in the franchise captured the nightmarish insanity of that first movie.  It scraped together funding from local lawyers and friends, got picked up by the same company that released Deep Throat, and eventually made $31 million globally. A courtroom battle later revealed that after investors and legal fees, only $8,100 was left to split between 20 cast and crew members.  Regardless, it launched Hooper\u2019s career and got Spielberg\u2019s attention, who offered him Poltergeist. There\u2019s a long story and debate there about who really directed that movie.  Over the years, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise grew to include nine films, two video games, comics, a novel, and box office receipts totaling over $252 million. The most recent was released in 2022. So here we are again, the franchise is back on the table, and whoever ends up reviving Leatherface will be tapping into a brand with deep roots and blood-soaked history. But, I seriously doubt that whatever come of it will not reach the bar of horror that was set by the original.

{"date":"2025-03-22","content":"Authorities have blamed the deadly attack in the town of Kokorou on the Islamic State in the Great Sahara, an ISIL affiliate. The government of Niger has declared three days of mourning following an attack on a mosque in the country\u2019s southwest that killed at least 44 people. The victims were killed in a \u201csavage\u201d armed assault in the Fambita quarter of the rural border town of Kokorou, the interior ministry said in a statement broadcast on state television on Friday. The ministry said another 13 people were wounded. West Africa\u2019s Sahel region has seen an uptick in violence in recent years following the rise of armed fighters linked to the al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS) armed groups that took over territory in north Mali after the 2012 Tuareg rebellion. Since then, it has spread into neighbouring Niger and Burkina Faso, and more recently into the north of coastal West African countries such as Togo and Ghana. Niger\u2019s interior ministry said the latest attack occurred early in the afternoon as people were attending a prayer service at the mosque during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. \u201cThe heavily armed terrorists surrounded the mosque to carry out their massacre with unusual cruelty,\u201d it said, adding that the attackers also set fire to a local market and homes. The defence ministry blamed the attack on the Islamic State in the Great Sahara, or EIGS, an affiliate of ISIL, in a statement late on Friday.      EIGS had no immediate reaction to the allegation. Previous attacks in Niger were claimed by al-Qaeda affiliate groups. The government has promised to hunt down the perpetrators and put them on trial. The military-run government of Niger frequently fights armed groups in the region, and civilians are often victims of the violence. Since July 2023, at least 2,400 people have been killed in Niger, according to the database of ACLED, a non-governmental organisation that gives armed conflict location and event data. Across the greater Sahel region that encompasses several countries, hundreds of thousands more have been killed and millions displaced as armed groups attack towns and villages as well as government security outposts. The failure of governments to restore security contributed to two coups in Mali, two in Burkina Faso and one in Niger between 2020 and 2023. All three remain under military rule despite regional and international pressure to hold elections. Since the coups, authorities have turned away from traditional Western allies and have sought military support from Russia instead.          Follow Al Jazeera English:","label":0}
