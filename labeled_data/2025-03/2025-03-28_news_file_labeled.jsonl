{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Business Insider Edition  Stocks are in a danger zone closely watched by technical analysts for signs of further weakness ahead.           The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 have both been trading below theur 200-day moving average, an important technical indicator that helps identify the long-term direction of a trend.                When securities fall below this level, it sends a warning to traders that the prior uptrend in price could be on the verge of reversing course and establishing a downtrend.               The Samp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 have been trading below their respective 200-day moving averages since early March, and perhaps more importantly, they both retested the level and failed to climb back above it.               That trading behavior tracks with a key principle of technical analysis, which is that an old support level becomes the new resistance at the start of a downtrend.               The recent trading behavior solidifies the idea that the 200-day moving average is now acting as a resistance level for stocks.               The recent sell-off could also mark the start of a new downtrend, which is defined as a series of lower highs and lower lows.               That's not to say that the bull market is over. There have been plenty of head fakes for traders who are laser-focused on the 200-day moving average, including in March 2023 and November 2023, when the index briefly traded below the indicator but quickly recovered.               But the longer the index trades below the key level, the higher the likelihood that a new downtrend is in place.                Katie Stockton, a closely followed technical analyst on Wall Street, told clients in a recent note that she expects the pain in stocks to continue.               \"Our intermediate-term indicators suggest the correction will resume mid- to late April,\" Stockton said, adding that recent trading behavior in the Nasdaq suggests \"a challenging Q2.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"I remember 1974 well. With inflation on the rise, the government had been locked in battle with trade unions over worker pay. The government appeared paralysed: stand up to the miners and strikes could shut down the power system, but give in and pay them more money and inflation would rocket. And then the global oil crisis came out of nowhere. It threw economies, including Britain's, into chaos. The government introduced a three-day week. Power cuts were common - we would be plunged into darkness without warning. And seemingly, the government just expected us to deal with it. This was also the year I began presenting the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama. We spent a lot of time debating these issues. People came on with all kinds of different ideas of what to do.  There were even suggestions that what the country really needed to take back control from the unions was a military takeover - a coup. There was another idea out there too. It was proposed by the Conservative politician Keith Joseph and was entirely radical - so removed from the mainstream, in fact, that during filming of Panorama, Joseph turned to the production team and asked exasperatedly if they understood what he meant. That idea was the free market. This meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security. If, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that's exactly the point. What we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever. US President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before. It might yet weather the storm. However others are asking, is the free market system fatally flawed and doomed to failure? So much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight. But at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war. I was six when the war ended. There was rationing \u2013 coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain.  With Clement Attlee's landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain's political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism.  But more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet.  \"We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we're proud of it,\" was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done. However not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher's ear. That the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher's reforms were with the American right.  Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn't agree with some of Reagan's trade policies. Thatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread. The Thatcher government's big idea was that they weren't just going to sell the shares in state-owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people.  In December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders.  And Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn't just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular. In Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of \u00a360bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders. Britain was embracing the free market. This wasn't just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain's relationship with money, with government, and with itself. And if Thatcher's privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain's financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City. There were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences. At the core of Thatcher's thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder. James Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him. But then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate. \"You get to a system whereby, to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force 'Goodbye, we can't use you anymore - you're too expensive'. \"You've got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we're going offshore.\" Goldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that's literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing. And to make things worse, he argued that Britain had ceded sovereignty to the likes of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with Britain binding itself to an economic system run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, only adding to the sense of alienation felt in collapsing communities. And with global markets dictating policy. If an industry wasn't profitable, it was left to die. Today, the UK may be a global leader in science and financial services but is that of much consolation to communities where we once made things that are now made offshore?  Based on what I often heard in my many years touring the country presenting Question Time, I'm not sure it is. Goldsmith would end up trying to go into politics. His Referendum Party was trounced in the 1997 general election but he had planted a seed. He had argued that the global free market path that Britain and the rest of the world was going down was dangerous. That it would spread division around the world. Fast-forward nearly 20 years to 2016 and his warning came to pass. Britain voted to leave the European Union and the verdict could not be clearer: the Leave vote was highest in those left-behind communities, seemingly fuelled by those who felt globalisation was not working for them. The dream of a nation of shareholders has soured too. In 1989 Thames Water was privatised. We were promised lower bills, better infrastructure, less red tape and investment in a system fraying at the edges. It was investment that the global capitalist system was supposedly best placed to provide. What followed was something else entirely. Debt ballooned and dividends flowed to shareholders. The company extracted profit while pipes leaked and sewage poured into rivers. And our bills now pay for interest on that debt - it feels like we've come a long way from Thatcher's nation of shareholders. Back in 1994, James Goldsmith had posited that the problem with the free market dream was that it didn't protect the home base. Now, there is someone else much more powerful who takes that view. President Trump's methods are so erratic that with him it's hard to tell what is going on. His readiness to slap hugely consequential tariffs on countries that are both traditional foes and supposed friends at times defies easy explanation. But what we can say is that he is trying to return to ideas that preceded the free market. He is trying to make America strong through protectionism, making it harder for anyone to simply sell anywhere. There is an argument that if you take the long view then perhaps the free market period is the outlier. Britain itself had a long, long period of protectionism before it embraced free trade.  Tariffs are nothing new in world economic history and in a sense Trump is just trying to return the US to how things were, albeit in quite a chaotic way. The reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge. But that challenge is coming not from supporters of socialism who ideologically back a big role for the state. Instead, the challenge is coming from Trump, a man who is broadly speaking of the right and has no qualms with capitalism allowing people to become very rich. That the challenge is coming from within is what makes it so potent.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Samsung couldn't prove that Oura's litigious history indicated an \"actual\" threat to the Galaxy Ring. But the legal battle is far from over.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Samsung's lawsuit against Oura has been dismissed without prejudice in U.S. District Court. While federal judge Araceli Mart\u00ednez-Olgu\u00edn gave Samsung until late April to file an amended complaint, there isn't much legal leeway. And this ruling is a reminder that Samsung aside, the smart ring industry remains in legal limbo even as things appear normal. Last summer, Samsung preemptively sued Oura, arguing that \"Oura's pattern of indiscriminate assertion of patent infringement\" against smart ring brands like Ultrahuman, Circular, and RingConn was an \"actual, imminent risk to Samsung\" and the upcoming Galaxy Ring. The March 27 ruling \u2014 spotted by ip fray's Florian Mueller and shared with Android Central \u2014 shows Mart\u00ednez-Olgu\u00edn argue that Oura's general statements about enforcing its patents \"were not directed at Samsung\" and \"do not reveal a likelihood or intent to enforce Oura\u2019s patents against Samsung.\" Oura only reserved the right to \"take the action that's appropriate.\" It may decide that means suing Samsung, but Samsung lacks standing to argue future harm to its business without anything concrete.  Samsung can refile the suit, but only with \"allegations that predate the filing of the initial complaint,\" and we don't know of any overt threats Oura made against Samsung before or after the Galaxy Ring launch. Mueller argues in his analysis that Samsung's lawsuit successfully hampered Oura's legal action until some of its patents were \"rendered moot\" due to statutory limitations. He also believes Samsung may try to amend its complaint or appeal the dismissal, even without a \"smoking gun,\" to forestall Oura from suing in another district like East Texas. Samsung's stalling gambit has given the Galaxy Ring almost a year of unimpeded sales. But if this ruling eventually clears the way for Oura to sue, it could interfere with the hypothetical Galaxy Ring 2 or later models. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Of course, as this ruling states, there's no proof that Oura will sue Samsung after this. And we're still waiting to see how the other top smart ring brands will fare in their own Oura patent infringement lawsuits. We've reached out to Samsung for comment on this ruling and will update the post if we hear back.  In March 2024, Oura filed an International Trade Commission (ITC) action against Circular, RingConn, and Ultrahuman, stating they had \"no choice\" but to legally challenge brands that \"imitate and ride the coattails of our innovation\" through patent infringement. A month later, the ITC announced a Section 337 investigation, indicating Oura had asked for a \"limited exclusion order and cease and desist orders\" that would essentially ban these brands from sale in the United States. A year later, the investigation page still shows as \"Pending before the Administrative Law Judge,\" with the most recent notice in December 2024 indicating that certain aspects of the case are still being amended. There's no way to know how long it'll take or how the change in U.S. administration will affect the ruling, but the case hasn't gone away.  Frankly, it's easy to forget how fragile the smart ring industry is at this moment. Smart ring sales were under a million in 2023 and should climb to 2.5 million in 2025, per IDC predictions shared with Android Central. The top smart ring brands keep releasing new models and signs point to strong sales. The Circular Ring 2 is at $1.6 million and climbing for its Kickstarter, promising blood pressure and glucose readings. Ultrahuman sells luxury smart rings and constantly updates its Ring Air with new \"Powerplug\" features. RingConn launched its Gen 2 ring last year and the Gen 2 Air this month. Unless you pay close attention to legal filings, you'd have no idea that the smart ring industry could come to a crashing halt if Oura proves that most of its competitors infringe on its ideas. And those ideas keep coming! While researching possible designs for the Oura Ring 5, I found dozens of Oura patents filed in 2025 alone and hundreds more before that, ranging from new one-size-fits-all design ideas to more outlandish tricks like unlocking or controlling your car with your Oura Ring.  Samsung has its own patented ideas for the Galaxy Ring 2, like an outer temperature sensor to detect if you have a fever, gesture controls for other connected devices like a laptop or tablet, or a resizable design that'll morph into your finger size. It also has more resources than startup brands like Circular and Ultrahuman, which could make it a tougher opponent for Oura to battle in the courts. Still, even Apple had to reckon with a potential watch recall over the Masimo blood oxygen patent dispute, and Samsung has already lost one legal fight. Ultimately, no matter which smart ring brand you wear or are interested in, you may want to pay close attention to Oura's ITC case and the likely follow-up to Samsung's counter-suit.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Business Insider Edition  Elon Musk on Friday announced in a post on X that his artificial intelligence company, xAI, had acquired his social media platform, X, in an all-stock deal.          \"The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion ($45B less $12B debt),\" Musk wrote.                Musk purchased X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, for $44 billion\u00a0\u2014\u00a0despite the company's board initially being resistant to the Tesla CEO's proposition. Musk also attempted to\u00a0back out of the purchase, though he faced a $1 billion termination fee if the deal fell through.\u00a0The sale was ultimately completed in October 2022, and the once publicly traded social media company went private under Musk's ownership.               Since his acquisition of X, Musk has gutted the site's trust and safety team, users have reported spikes in antisemitic content and other hate speech on the platform, and X has been plagued by an exodus of advertisers. Business Insider's Peter Kafka earlier this month reported that the billionaire CEO has been so far unable to completely turn the social media site's trajectory around, but investors have remained interested in the platform  \u2014 in part due to its financial ties to xAI.               Prior to the news of the acquisition, X held a $6 billion stake in Musk's artificial intelligence company, per Bloomberg.               Musk founded xAI in March 2023 with the goal of \"building artificial intelligence to accelerate human scientific discovery.\" The company, a competitor to OpenAI, has since launched a large language model chatbot called Grok, which is integrated with X and relies, in part, on data generated on the site for training.               \"xAI and X's futures are intertwined,\" Musk continued in his Friday announcement. \"Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent. This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI's advanced AI capability and expertise with X's massive reach.\"               He added: \"I would like to recognize the hardcore dedication of everyone at xAI and X that has brought us to this point. This is just the beginning.\"               A spokesperson for X declined to comment on the deal when reached by Business Insider.Representatives for xAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from BI.               In a post amplifying Musk's announcement, X CEO Linda Yaccarino wrote the future of the two companies \"could not be brighter.\"               The deal between X and xAI isn't the first time Musk has made a similar move between his businesses. In 2016, Tesla acquired SolarCity \u2014\u00a0a solar panel company founded by Musk's cousins, Peter and Lyndon Rive \u2014\u00a0for $2.6 billion, taking on $3 billion of Solar City's debts in the process.               SolarCity was turned into Tesla Energy, which then had to contend with a lawsuit from angry shareholders who argued that the takeover amounted to a bailout of SolarCity. Musk ultimately won that lawsuit, avoiding roughly $2 billion in damages.               \"I think this deal gets rid of a troublesome company \u2014\u00a0like SolarCity before, X now \u2014 and takes it out of the spotlight,\" Ann Lipton, a corporate law expert and law professor at Tulane University, told Business Insider. \"But xAI is so opaque and so controlled by Musk, and its investors are so close to him, that it's hard to say what kind of downside they see.\"               Lipton, who has written about Musk's acquisition of Twitter, said Musk has functionally eliminated shareholders who might have otherwise questioned X's valuation and trajectory.               \"Now we might ask whether xAI is worth the hype, but at least for now I suspect the X holders are happy with the swap,\" Lipton said. \"Musk makes a troublesome holding less visible and if xAI is over-hyped, well, that's a reckoning that will come later.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Business Insider Edition  In early February, as the furor around Elon Musk and DOGE's remaking of the federal government began to swell on the left, Democratic Rep. Julie Johnson sold off her Tesla stock.          The Texas Democrat wasn't trying to make a statement. An independent financial advisor had made the decision to sell off her shares \u2014 worth between $16,000 and $65,000 \u2014 without her input.               \"I'm all for people selling Tesla stock,\" Johnson told BI. \"In my personal situation, I have money managers that take care of all of it, and I don't have anything to do with what we buy and sell.\"               While Johnson was selling, some of her fellow Democratic colleagues were buying, according to a review of recently filed periodic transaction reports.               Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, whose South Texas district is home to the headquarters of Musk's SpaceX, bought at least $65,000 worth of Tesla stock earlier this month. Rep. Gil Cisneros of California, meanwhile, bought between $1,000 and $15,000.               And Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, one of the most frequent traders in Congress, bought and sold thousands of dollars in Tesla stock several times in both January and February of this year.               As with Johnson, some of those trades are said to have been made by someone else. A spokesman for Cisneros said that \"outside financial advisors who have a fiduciary responsibility to maintain a diverse portfolio\" managed the congressman's investments. He also pointed out that Cisneros was critical of Musk both before and after making the trade.               \"Unlike President Trump, who held an impromptu Tesla infomercial for Elon Musk on the White House lawn, and Secretary Lutnick, who violated the law when he implored people to buy Tesla stock during a television interview, Congressman Cisneros has never abused his official position to benefit a private entity,\" the spokesman said.               Similarly, a spokesperson for Gottheimer told BI that all of his trades are made by a \"third party\" and that the congressman is in the midst of setting up a blind trust.               A spokesperson for Gonzalez did not return multiple requests for comment.               In recent weeks, some Democrats \u2014 and others opposed to Musk's politics \u2014 have taken intentional aim at Tesla, including selling their Tesla vehicles.               Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona recently sold off his Tesla for a Chevy Tahoe, and Sen. Adam Schiff of California recently told Semafor that he'd be \"happy to unload\" his Tesla.               \"Elon Musk kind of turned out to be an asshole,\" Kelly said in a video at the time.       Used Tesla listings have increased by 33% this year, indicating that many are looking to sell their cars, with many apparently put off by Musk's antics.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"The BBC has \"decided to rule out\" placing adverts on some of its podcasts for UK listeners on sites such as Apple and Spotify. Last year, the corporation revealed it planned to put ads in some of its podcasts on commercial platforms to \"generate more revenue to support the BBC\". But some of Britain's biggest media companies objected - including ITV, Sky, commercial radio giants Bauer and Global, and Gary Lineker's production company Goalhanger - with a joint letter to the government warning that the move would be \"disastrous\" for the UK podcast market. The BBC said: \"We have listened to feedback and having considered the options carefully, we have decided to rule out placing adverts around BBC licence-fee funded programmes on third party podcast platforms in the UK.\" A spokesperson added: \"We will continue to support the audio sector and the wider market, investing in the best ideas and developing production capabilities across the UK.\" Under the plan, adverts would not have been placed in shows on the corporation's own audio platform, BBC Sounds. The letter sent by the media companies to the government last May said: \"Forcing users to migrate to BBC Sounds if they want to hear content ad-free also has the impact of putting BBC Sounds at a distinct advantage as a platform, having an unfair competitive advantage when it comes to competition between listening platforms.\" It added: \"These changes are highly likely to have a significant adverse impact on fair and effective competition in the UK podcast market.\" Podcast advertising was worth \u00a376m in 2022, it said, compared with the BBC's income of \u00a35.7bn. The BBC's plan for adverts on podcasts, listed in the 2024\/2025 annual plan, had said it would \"assess this proposal for compliance with our regulatory obligations\".   The corporation currently gets most of its income from the licence fee, which costs \u00a3169.50 a year. BBC Studios sells ads on BBC podcasts outside the UK. When the plan to do the same in the UK was announced a year ago, the BBC said it would \"generate more revenue to support the BBC, licence-fee payers our suppliers and rights holders\". Last year, director general Tim Davie said the broadcaster's annual savings target would rise to \u00a3700m a year by 2028. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has started negotiations with the BBC about the corporation's funding after its current royal charter expires in 2027. The charter, drawn up by the government, sets out the terms and purposes of the BBC's existence and normally lasts for about a decade. In January, Nandy ruled out funding the BBC from taxes if the licence fee was to be abolished. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport declined to comment on the BBC's podcast decision.

Milton was convicted of defrauding investors in his zero-emission truck company in 2023. by  Andrew J. Hawkins Trevor Milton, the founder of Nikola Motors who was convicted of defrauding investors in his zero-emission truck company, has been pardoned by President Donald Trump, the White House confirmed Friday. A federal jury convicted Milton of lying about Nikola\u2019s capabilities, including an assertion that it had built its own electric truck, the Nikola One, from the \u201cground up.\u201d He was also accused of staging a video that purportedly showed its Nikola One semi driving under its own power when it was actually rolling down a hill. Milton was sentenced to four years in prison, but remained out on bond while he appealed his conviction. \u201cI am free,\u201d Milton said in a video posted on X. \u201cThe prosecutors can no longer hurt me.\u201d Founded in 2015, Nikola staked out a unique position in the EV space by claiming it would make zero-emission big rigs using hydrogen fuel cell technology. But questions emerged about the company\u2019s claims after short-selling firm Hindenburg Research published a bombshell report accusing Nikola of fraud, including the video showing the truck rolling down a hill. The report set off a chain reaction that resulted in Milton\u2019s stepping down as board chair and CEO and his eventual arrest. In addition to staging the video, Milton was accused of falsely claiming to produce his own hydrogen fuels at below-market rates and obtaining \u201cbillions and billions and billions and billions\u201d of dollars\u2019 worth of committed truck orders. Earlier this year, Nikola filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Milton isn\u2019t the first controversial figure for the transportation world to receive a pardon from Trump.

The company's CEO, Calvin McDonald, said in an earnings call with investors on Thursday that it would introduce leggings without a front seam, a highly requested change.               \"We'll expand further with other new bottoms, including a legging with no front seam,\" McDonald said to investors.               \"Our guests have been asking for this innovation, and we believe this style, along with all the other newness and innovation we are bringing to market, will help drive new guest acquisition and increase purchase from existing guests as well,\" he added.               Representatives for Lululemon did not respond to a request for comment from BI about when the new product will be available and how much it will cost. The Vancouver-based company's leggings start at around $98.               McDonald said the new leggings were celebrating the 10th anniversary of Lululemon's Align product line, which includes leggings, shorts, sports bras, tops, bodysuits, and more.               Some social media users have criticized the front seam of Lululemon's leggings, with some women saying the seam can be unflattering.       @victoria.morris           Tell me im wrong?!  #lululemon#lululemonleggings#girlproblems#gumtok#gymgirl#momtok#momswhoworkout#momswholift#leggings#workoutleggings#momoftwo#relatablemom#relatable#gymlife#gymhumor#gymcomedy    original sound - victoria |  mom + lifestyle           Some TikTok users also say Lululemon's front seam is a big reason they've bought leggings from other brands.               This is not the first pair of leggings Lululemon has made without front seams.               In July, it dropped the $98 Breezethrough leggings without the front seam, but the product was pulled from shelves within the same month after customers criticized it for its deep V-shaped back seam.               The company reported results from its latest quarter on Thursday. Revenue increased 13% from the year before to $3.6 billion, and international sales rose 38% in the quarter.               The company's stock remained flat during trading hours on Thursday but dropped about 10% in after-hours trading.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"The popular products will be replaced by new models from First Alert and Yale. The popular products will be replaced by new models from First Alert and Yale. by  Jennifer Pattison Tuohy If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. In this week\u2019s least surprising news, Google has announced it\u2019s discontinuing the Nest Protect Smart Smoke and CO alarm and the Nest x Yale smart door lock. The Nest Protect, which has long been one of the best smart smoke alarms you can buy, has been hard to find for a while now, with users complaining on Reddit that the device either isn\u2019t in stock or that the Google store is limiting purchases to one and shipping them out slowly.  In a post on its Nest community forum, Google says it made the decision to ditch its popular smoke alarm and door lock as part of its move toward \u201cbuilding a platform that all device makers and developers can use to spur innovation in the home.\u201d The company added that as the smart home evolves, it \u201cmust continue to refine our portfolio of devices to meet the needs of our customers.\u201d The Nest Protect was launched in 2013, with a second-gen model following in 2015, after the first-gen model was recalled due to a questionable wave-to-silence feature. The company is now partnering with First Alert, owned by Resideo, to launch the First Alert Smart Smoke & Carbon Monoxide Alarm in the US and Canada later this year.  The new alarm will cost $129 and can interconnect with existing Nest Protect devices via Google\u2019s Weave \/ Thread communication protocol. However, it will connect to the Google Home app over Wi-Fi to send alerts and notifications. I\u2019ve written more about the new smoke alarm here. Google says the Nest Protect will continue to receive security updates and work as expected through its expiration dates (10 years from the date of manufacture for second-gen models). The alarm is still available to buy at the Google store and other retailers \u201cwhile supplies last.\u201d  Nest Protects are currently added and controlled via the Nest app, although Google recently announced it will migrate them to the Google Home app. Compatibility is currently available through Google Home\u2019s public preview, but Google says it will be available to all Google Home app users in the coming weeks.  Google is also killing its Nest x Yale door lock, which launched in 2018. It says existing Nest x Yale locks will continue to receive software and security updates, and the lock will function as expected. Google also says it will bring new features to the lock, including passcode management, from the Nest app to the Google Home app for the first time. Currently, the Nest x Yale lock needs to be set up and managed in the Nest app, but Google is slowly transitioning users away from that legacy app.  To offer a replacement for the lock, Google has again partnered with Yale to develop the Yale Smart Lock with Matter, which it says is \u201ca new smart lock designed to complement Nest doorbells coming this summer.\u201d The $170 lock is designed to fit in with the Google Nest video doorbell aesthetic but will work with any Matter-compatible ecosystem over the Thread protocol, including Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, and Samsung SmartThings. I\u2019ve written more about the new lock here.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Business Insider Edition  CoreWeave listed on the Nasdaq Friday amid a shifting narrative and much anticipation. The company priced its IPO at $40 per share. The stock flailed, opening at $39 per share, then falling as much as 6% and ending the day back up at $41.59.          The cloud firm, founded in 2017, is the first pure-play AI public offering in the US. CoreWeave buys graphics processing units from Nvidia and then pairs them with software to give companies an easy way to access the GPUs and achieve the top performance of their AI products and services.               The company's financial future is dependent on two unknowns \u2014 that the use and usefulness of AI will grow immensely, and that those workloads will continue to run on Nvidia GPUs.           It's no wonder that the listing has often been described as a bellwether for the entire AI industry.               But CoreWeave's specific business has some contours that could be responsible for Friday's ambivalent debut without passing judgment on AI as a whole.               CoreWeave customers are highly concentrated and its suppliers are even more so. The company is highly leveraged, with billions in debt, collateralized by GPUs. The future obsolescence of those GPUs is looming.               Umesh Padval, managing director of Thomvest expects the pricing for the GPU computing CoreWeave offers to go down in the next 12 to 18 months as GPU supply continues to improve, which could challenge the company's future profitability.               \"In general, it's not a bellwether in my opinion,\" Padval told Business Insider.               So what does it mean that CoreWeave's debut didn't rise to meet hopes and expectations?               Karl Mozurkewich, principal architect at cloud firm Valdi told BI the Friday IPO is more of a test for the neocloud concept than for AI. Neoclouds are a term used to describe young public cloud providers that solely focus on accelerated computing. They often use Nvidia's preferred reference architecture and, in theory, demonstrate the best possible performance for Nvidia's hardware.               Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang gave the buch a shoutout at the company's tentpole GTC conference last week.               \"What they do is just one thing. They host GPUs,\" Huang said to an audience of nearly 18,000. \"They call themselves GPU clouds, and one of our great partners, CoreWeave, is in the process of going public and we're super proud of them.\"               CoreWeave's public market performance will signal what shape the future could take for these companies, according to Mozurkewich. Will more companies try to replicate the GPU-cloud model? Will Nvidia seed more similar businesses? Will it continue to give neoclouds early access to new hardware?               \"I think the industry is very interested to see if the shape of CoreWeave is long-term successful,\" Mozurkewich said.               Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group, told BI that CoreWeave is \"one measuring point of the AI trade; it isn't entirely indicative of the overall AI market or AI demand.\" He added the company has the opportunity to improve its fate as AI scales and the customer base grows and diversifies.               Lucas Keh, Semiconductors Analyst at Third Bridge agreed.               \"Currently, more than 70% of CoreWeave's revenue comes from hyperscalers, but our experts expect this concentration to decrease 1\u20142 years after an IPO as the company diversifies its customer base beyond public cloud customers,\" Keh said via email.               Having a handful of large, dominant enterprise customers is not uncommon for a young provider like CoreWeave, Mozurkewich said. But it's also no surprise that it could concern investors.               \"This is where CoreWeave has a chance to shine as AI and the demand for AI spans beyond the big 7 to 10 names. The caveat will be how stable GPU prices are as availability increases and competition increases,\" Newman said.               Other issues, like obsolescence, the necessary depreciation, and leverage will be harder to shake.       Have a tip or an insight to share?

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Organizers behind a pronatalist conference with far-right ties in Austin, Texas, this weekend have set up matchmaking events for attendees that include the option of getting married onsite as part of their greater effort to repopulate the world, WIRED has learned. According to its website, the sold-out Natal Conference, taking place March 28-29 at a hotel operated by the University of Texas at Austin, has \u201cno political or ideological goal other than a world in which our children can have grandchildren.\u201d But the event, an earlier version of which was promoted by Elon Musk, features speakers like Pizzagate conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec and Cr\u00e9mieux, an online pseudonym linked, according to The Guardian, to Jordan Lasker, who discusses falling birthrates and promotes eugenics. Natal Conference organizer Kevin Dolan, a father of at least six, according to Politico, has previously stated that eugenics\u2014the belief that white people are genetically superior\u2014and the pronatalist movement are \u201cvery much aligned.\u201d Publicly available details about the Natal Conference are scant, with the vague online conference agenda promising closed-door sessions to address collapsing birth rates. However, an email obtained by WIRED promoting a preconference mixer held Thursday night reveals matchmaking may play a significant role at the conference and in the pronatalist movement more widely. \u201cThis is a special email to NatalCon attendees who indicated they were highly interested in finding the missing puzzle piece for singles, matchmaking, marriage, and family formation,\u201d reads the email, sent by an event producer named Luke, who did not sign with his last name. \u201cWe were stunned to receive many emails saying, \u2018NatalCon needs to be focusing on this, right now!\u2019 And we're here to serve you. This is coming from all sectors: singles, parents with dating-age children, grandparents, newlyweds that want to help their friends start families, and more,\u201d the email said. Attendees are instructed to register to learn the exact venue (though it is listed elsewhere on the website), and registration was listed as costing $10,000 for the full weekend\u2014an increase from earlier this year when the cost was 90 percent cheaper. (A Saturday-only ticket is $500.) Last year\u2019s VIP package was $1,000, according to the NatalCon website. After credit card details are handed over, organizers vet potential attendees, requiring them to submit their social media handles. The website says prospective attendees aren\u2019t charged unless they\u2019re approved. NatalCon organizers, including Dolan, did not respond to messages from WIRED seeking comment. Single registrants are directed to fill out a survey that asks their desired number of children (listing 1 to over 7 as options), \u201creligious, spiritual, cultural, lifestyle\u201d values, and whether they would be open to a \u201cQ&A with a NatalCon speaker to introduce yourself to the room.\u201d Speaking to Edward Dutton\u2014who has been described as a \u201cproponent of pseudo-scientific \u2018race science,\u2019\u201d by anti-extremism group Hope Not Hate\u2014on a Jolly Heretic podcast in 2023, Dolan described his alma mater, Brigham Young University, as a \u201cbreeding program\u201d for smart Mormons. He said his pronatalist events are a counter to the \u201cperverse incentives in the dating app market.\u201d In the email to NatalCon attendees, Luke noted the conference had set up multiple sessions throughout the conference to strategize on the issue of matchmaking. The email concludes by noting that there will be \u201csome ministers attending if anyone decides to take the leap at the conference!\u201d Luke also instructed attendees to \u201ccome up with great ideas\u201d regarding matchmaking, which will be passed on to him \u201cfor implementation.\u201d Other conference guests include Indian Bronson, the pseudonymous founder of AI dating app Keeper (he\u2019s no longer affiliated with the company), which aims to help people start a family, and influencers Simone and Malcolm Collins, who have four kids and say they plan to have up to 13. The pronatalist movement, which views declining birth rates around the world as an existential threat, has seen a boom in recent years, propelled by famous and powerful tech elites, including Musk, who has 14 children. Tweeting about the 2023 Natal Conference, Musk said, \u201cIf birth rates continue to plummet, human civilization will end.\u201d Even tech elites who have not explicitly associated themselves with the movement seem generally aligned with its aims: Sam Altman, for instance, has invested in multiple fertility startups and said he would like to have a family with \u201csix or eight\u201d children. The movement gained even more momentum during the 2024 election, when comments surfaced of then vice presidential candidate JD Vance calling Democrats \"childless cat ladies\u201d around the time of his Senate run in 2021; he also previously said people with children \u201cshould have more power\u201d than \u201cpeople who don\u2019t have kids.\u201d However, the pronatalist movement has been criticized as being racist and classist, with some startups catering to adherents by even offering to screen embryos used for in vitro fertilization for IQ. Dolan told the Jolly Heretic podcast his pronatalist events weed out \u201cstupid people.\u201d \u201cSome of the debates that I hear about natalism [are] like, \u2018We can\u2019t have natalism, we have too many stupid people.\u2019 But in my opinion the only people who are going to respond to any of our natalism conferences, natalism conversations, are going to be on the higher end of the distribution,\u201d he said. Despite criticism of the conference, University of Texas at Austin spokesperson Mike Rosen told WIRED the school rents out its spaces indiscriminately. \u201cThe AT&T Hotel & Conference Center leases space to non-University groups for their events without regard to their viewpoint consistent with the First Amendment,\" Rosen said. The venue also hosted an Ayn Rand conference in February. Updated: 3\/31\/2025, 11:30 AM EDT: This article has been updated to reflect that while pseudonymous writer Indian Bronson was a co-founder of the Keeper dating app, he is no longer affiliated with the company.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Imagine making a big mess, only to realize it was for naught. A judge has dismissed Samsung\u2019s attempt at striking before the iron\u2019s hot. Last summer, before Samsung had even released the Galaxy Ring to the public, the company filed a lawsuit asking a judge to proclaim its business didn\u2019t infringe on any patents, specifically, patents related to the Oura Ring. This week, the judge ruled this as malarkey (not a direct quote), and Samsung has until late April to appeal the decision with an amended complaint. What does all this legal back-and-forth mean? Samsung struck before Oura, the company behind the Oura Ring, could sniff through its patents and get litigious. Samsung figured that since Oura is known for going after its competition on standard wellness patents\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u2019s gone after lower-cost brands like Ringconn and Circular\u00e2\u0080\u0094it would come after Samsung, too. Considering Oura\u2019s business is squarely the smart ring and the accompanying ecosystem, it makes sense. Samsung had asked the judge to file a declaratory judgment lawsuit in the Northern District of California court, where it filed the suit. This \u201cjudgment\u201d would indicate that Samsung had not copied any of Oura\u2019s patents, like one for \u201cassessing a readiness score of a user\u201d and a \u201cmethod for manufacturing thereof.\u201d Samsung claims that Oura had a \u201cpattern of indiscriminate assertion of patent infringement against any and all competitors in the smart ring market\u201d as the reason for its lawsuit. Judge Araceli Mart\u00c3\u00adnez-Olgu\u00c3\u00adnp ultimately threw out the lawsuit. Samsung was trying to strike against Oura before Oura could strike against it. It\u2019s lawsuit ping-pong, with Samsung starting it out in Northern California, where Oura is headquartered, to get a declaration filed before Oura attempts to bring the fight to Samsung\u2019s turf in Texas, where it has slightly more reign. Ultimately, the power these companies have is inherently related to how much money they have to throw at lawsuits, even before they materialize. Oura may not have as much manufacturing prowess as Samsung, but it\u2019s not doing too badly\u00c2\u00a0in\u00c2\u00a0securing the funding it needs to continue. It helps, too, that Oura is a good product. It\u2019s good enough that Samsung is afraid it\u2019ll come for its business, even if it is relatively minor.  oura ringPatent Warssamsung galaxy ringsmart rings  \r           Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r          \r           News from the future, delivered to your present.\r          \r       Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r                 Oura hopes its AI will help guide you toward better health.

It's available to pre-order today for $349 and will start shipping October 15.

Was it the irreverent branding that didn\u2018t connect with British sensibilities? Or proof that even viral marketing can\u2019t guarantee product success? According to behavioral science expert Phill Agnew, the answer is more nuanced. In the UK, tap water isn't just acceptable, but a point of pride. Scottish tap water is famously excellent, and many Brits are genuinely proud of their municipal water quality. The cold climate creates another unique challenge: water comes out of pipes already refreshingly chilled. This natural advantage eliminates one key selling point of bottled water \u2014 coldness \u2014 before the marketing battle even begins. \u201cThe idea that you're going to splash cash on something you can get for free out of your tap is quite hard for a lot of Brits to swallow,\u201d Agnew explains. People in the UK fall into two camps: loyal tap water drinkers, or price-sensitive bottled water buyers. Asking either group to buy premium canned water was fighting deeply ingrained habits. As Agnew points out, when Red Bull came to market, they weren't asking people to drink soda for the first time. But Liquid Death was trying to get Brits to buy canned water, something they just don\u2019t do. This challenge was compounded by a channel mismatch. Liquid Death\u2018s social media prowess didn\u2019t align with UK purchasing behavior. Brits don't buy water online. They grab it at stores while shopping for other items. \u201cThere's something slightly perverse in trying to sell it online when the sale point is actually in person,\u201d Agnew notes. Despite killer marketing that made the brand stand out in a \u201csea of sameness,\u201d UK-based Agnew points out a crucial flaw: \u201cI have not seen a single person drinking Liquid...

Sort of gives a different meaning to \"checks and balances.\"  Trump gets the checks to increase his balance. Good for whom? Oh thank goodness Hunter Biden is safe from prosecution. Hunter Biden being safe from prosecution is good in the same way that Richard Nixon being safe from prosecution was a good thing. Now, purchasing presidential pardons is something entirely different.  Why isn't this a bribe?  Well, ... many reasons, including the Supreme Court giving Trump immunity for basically anything he does, the DOJ being Trump's wingman, and Congress being Trump's other wingman.  Sort of gives a different meaning to \"checks and balances.\"  Trump gets the checks to increase his balance.   The first time (end of 2020) Donny scribbled on pardons, the results [reason.com] were:        Trump has issued 94 pardons and commutations;     68 of the 94 advance his political agenda;     40 of 94 recipients had a personal connection to the President;     20 of the 94 had some sort of celebrity status;     86 of the 94 had some sort of personal or political connection to the President;     Only 7 of the 94 appear to have been recommended by the DOJ Office of the Pardon Attorney.   And of course they were for sale [opensecrets.org] then, too.   Take your bothsides nonsense somewhere where readers enjoy being gaslit, like the NYT. What does other people have to do with what Trump is doing wrong? Yes, because Trump absolutely didn't pardon a bunch of cronies and criminals who paid for clemency on his way out the door in January of 2021. You fucking cultist muppet. Came here to say that SBF must be jumping for joy at this news, he should be free as soon as the check clears. \"...granting me this sacred pardon of innocence...\" Who is stupid enough to not be nauseated by this language, SuperKendall?

I've been reading over the pardons list, and pretty much the entire list of who he's pardoned this term have been either wealthy con artists, his backers or his donors. I'm pretty certain this is not why the founders bestowed this power on presidents. It was *supposed* to be a last resort to undo grevious injustices. Now I'm not saying this is unique to him. Presidents have been doing this shit for as long as I've been alive, but its become particularly egrarious under trump.

One thing it absolutely does though, is remove any 5th amendment protections against testifying in ongoing criminal proceedings against co-conspirators. If you no longer have any jeopardy of being prosecuted, you cannot use protections against self-incrimination.  Of course, these idiots aren't thinking of that, but it might get really useful if he pardons the wrong guy and a prosecutor out there wants to compel testimony.

Since when did someone have to accept a pardon?  There's nothing about that in the Constitution.  The President pardons people whether they like it or not. That is apparently an open question. People have rejected pardons. Some of the January 6 people did so, in fact. Whether or not they can do that has to be decided by a court, and nobody has cared enough about forcing someone to accept a pardon to actually do that.  People have rejected pardons. Some of the January 6 people did so, in fact. Got a link? That would be an interesting read.  People have rejected pardons. Some of the January 6 people did so, in fact.  Got a link?

[northeastern.edu] Yup. https:\/\/slashdot.org\/comments.... [slashdot.org] Only $1.8 million? That's Bill Clinton level bribery. I am disappoint. A king is the fountainhead of justice. Those were forward-looking statements. Is there anyone who donated money or campaigned for Trump that didn't get a pardon? Epstein.  how much a presidential pardon costs.  seems a bit cheap actually, but he IS a deal-maker, right? If someone is convicted of a heinous crime that causes great suffering to individuals there should be no route to pardon other than by a randomly selected multi-judge panel who finds the person wrongly convicted. Note, the key here is that the judges are randomly selected. I understand we need to sometimes exchange prisoners such as spies, but in that instance it must require approval from a randomly selected panel from the public (similar to juries), AND, the person must be exiled or banned from the US.  To be fair, Presidential pardons used to be rigorously vetted and *usually* granted only after a certain number of years or after the person had served their sentence -- not simply because one gained favor of the President through friends or bribes - I mean - donations.  Trump recently fired the pardon attorney at DOJ, whose job it was to research people and circumstances - guess she wasn't needed anymore...  His lawyer is (now) U.S. AG Pam Bondi's brother and Milton donated $1.8M to Trump.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Business Insider Edition  Wall Street thinks the risk of a recession is growing, and according to Morgan Stanley's top stock strategist, there are a few moves investors can make to position for an economic slowdown.           Mike Wilson, the chief investment officer at the bank, said he believes the risk of recession had gone up to around 30%-35%, up from 10%-20% at the start of the year. That's weighing on the outlook for stocks, he said, adding that the S&P 500 could drop below 5,500 in event of a hard landing.               \"Once again, I think a majority of strategists and clients came into the year probably too bullish about kind of the trajectory,\" Wilson said speaking to Bloomberg on Thursday. The bank's base case though, is that the S&P 500 will rise to 6,500 over the next 12 months, which implies the benchmark index rising 14% from current levels.               Talk of a potential recession has been growing louder on Wall Street. Earlier this month, Goldman Sachs raised its probability of a recession over the next 12 months from 15% to 20%. Meanwhile, a March survey conducted by Bank of America found that 55% of fund managers said they saw a global recession triggered by trade war as the top risk to the market.               Wilson said that the bank had been positioning for economic weakness over the last year, which is one reason Morgan Stanley's Focus List, a list of the bank's top investment ideas, has outperformed the S&P 500. The list has returned 7% year-to-date, compared to the benchmark index's 3% loss.               \"We're just being more tactical, I think, than most people,\" he added. \"So we've been in the right sectors; we've been in the right tractors, for the most part, really for the last year.\"               He highlighted several moves he and his team were making amid the current economy.               Morgan Stanley has shifted away from consumer goods stocks. That's due to underlying weakness in the economy, Wilson said, adding that he believed most of the \"private economy\" had already been in a recession for at least two years.               He pointed to the drop in home sales and manufacturing activity, which first began to decline several years ago.               \"We've been, you know, underweight consumer goods for literally three years and it's paid every year,\" he added.               Concerns about consumer spending have been on the rise recently.       Consumer confidence declined for the fourth straight month in March, with consumers' expectations for income, business activity, and the job market falling to the lowest level in 12 years, according to the Conference Board's latest survey.       Household finances\u00a0also look weaker, with fewer Americans able to cover\u00a0emergency expenses\u00a0than they were several years ago. According to the latest Survey of Consumer Expectations from the New York Fed, 63% of US households said they had enough cash on hand to cover a surprise $2,000 bill, the lowest proportion recorded since 2015, according to an analysis from Apollo Global Management.               For similar reasons, Wilson's team has also shifted away from small-cap stocks.               The Russell 2000 is down 7% so far this year.               \"Small cap stocks, it's paid every year to be underweight these areas,\" Wilson said. \"So the market gets the joke. I just think a lot of stock observers haven't really understood what's been going on here. You know, the economy has not been strong. It has not been a balanced, good economy.\"               Morgan Stanley's core portfolio is made up of high-quality companies in the defensive and growth sectors, Wilson said.               That's because, in the current economic climate, companies don't have pricing power. That differs from several years ago when inflation accelerated and companies were able to raise prices to boost profits, he said.               \"Today it's the exact opposite. Companies don't have pricing power, They can't really pass this on. So we've had a margin squeeze really in a lot of industries over the last couple of years, except for, if you're a monopoly,\" he added, pointing to large tech firms and other businesses that have been able to operate efficiently.               \"So that market is still very much intact,\" Wilson said.               Investors should have their eye on the market's laggards \u2014 and be ready to jump on them when the economy officially enters a recession, Wilson said.               \"If you have a true hard landing, the day that it becomes consensus, the first thing you want to do is buy the lowest quality stuff on the market,\" he said. You want to buy beaten up, you know, really levered companies, you know, bad balance sheet type businesses.\"               He pointed to consumer goods, materials, and the energy sector in particular, all of which could benefit as the economy enters a \"rolling recovery\" and which need fresh economic growth to reset and move higher, he said.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"The writing has been on the wall as Google has slowly moved away from Android as the core product and toward the bright light of artificial intelligence. This week\u2019s news about how Google plans to change how it develops the operating system seems to seal the deal. Android Authority confirmed that Google plans to take Android development entirely in-house. Essentially, Google is privatizing the Android source code. As with all things privatized, this is good news for Google, the company that operates Android. It streamlines Android development so that the company doesn\u2019t have to worry about managing two sets of source code and fielding comments while working on the next version of Android. It\u2019s good news for users, too, because it means there won\u2019t be two versions of Android floating out in the ether while it\u2019s in development. It can be confusing to navigate between the internal branch of Android source code, which Google passes out to the brands under Google Mobile Services (GMS) agreements, and the public Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which anyone and any manufacturer can use. It also speaks to how priorities have changed internally at Google as it shifts focus toward what AI can do on its various software platforms. Gemini is the main sell, now. It was apparent last year at Google I\/O 2024 that it would become the objective, especially after the hardware and software teams were combined into an all-inclusive \u201cPlatforms and Devices\u201d team. Then, a month after the conference, Google announced that former Vice President of Engineering for Android, David Burke, would be stepping into an advisory position at the company instead. Burke had been a steward of the platform for 14 years. The move to developing Android in-house shouldn\u2019t have too many implications on the platform. \u201cThe change makes sense when it comes to allocating resources to work that matters,\u201d texted Carolina Milanesi, a principal analyst, after I asked her about what this means for the broader smartphone market. Overall, nothing major will change with the Android platform on the consumer-facing side. The biggest difference will be in how Google interfaces with the developers who don\u2019t have GMS agreements. \u201cDevelopers will have maybe less understanding of what is coming\u2026but their access ultimately doesn\u2019t change,\u201d added Milanesi. As of this writing, Google hasn\u2019t publicly blogged about this change, though I independently confirmed with the company that this is the route it\u2019s headed. It\u2019s likely because nothing should change on the side of Android users. If anything, the code sleuthing you see going on around Android blogs may dry up over the coming months since Google won\u2019t release as much of its source code to the public until it\u2019s ready for primetime. It will annoy developers fishing around for future tidbits, but it shouldn\u2019t bother anyone using an Android phone otherwise.

Google hopes you will park and play, but most gaming in cars will only make sense if self-driving vehicles are a thing.                     Apple could be out $20 billion because of a court's decision.                     Gemini can tell you what it's looking at on your phone or through the camera way before Apple Intelligence can.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"     The iPhone company is reportedly moving away from smaller phones to even bigger handsets.    The company's small phones era is over. We have some bad news for lovers of the\u00a0iPhone Mini: It looks as though the diminutive device won't make a comeback anytime soon. Apple is not planning to reintroduce the smaller iPhone model, according to Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman. During a recent livestreamed Q&A session, he noted Apple has shifted away from smaller designs to go \"bigger and bigger and bigger,\" which in turn makes the smaller phones feel even smaller. \"We'll see what the market tells Apple,\" he added. The statements from the longtime Apple reporter, who has close ties to company sources, come as the company recently stopped selling its third-generation iPhone SE -- effectively leaving no iPhone model with a display under 6 inches. The company is also reportedly working on a foldable iPhone with a 7.8-inch crease-free inner display and a 5.5-inch outer display, with a launch date of as early as next year. The iPhone Mini, which hasn't been refreshed since 2021, had a 5.4-inch display. The smaller model debuted with the iPhone 12 Mini in 2020. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Although the iPhone 12 Mini and 13 Mini developed a niche fanbase, particularly among people who thought it fit better in their hands, they failed to gain widespread traction. At the time, Counterpoint Research reported the iPhone 12 Mini accounted for only 5% of iPhone 12 sales in January 2021. Neither the iPhone 12 Mini nor the 13 Mini cracked the top 10 list of best-selling smartphones by the end of that year, according to Counterpoint. Ramon Llamas, a director at market research firm IDC, told CNET \"the writing was on the wall for this one.\" \"With the trend to larger and larger smartphones -- hello there, iPhone Pro Max -- and the success of value-based products -- iPhone SE and iPhone 16E -- the iPhone Mini's niche spot in the world has been under constant pressure from all of its other iPhone cousins,\" Llamas said.\u00a0 \"I think a lot of people liked it, particularly for their aging parents who wanted something small and simple to handle -- but rarely for themselves.\"","label":0}

Google has discontinued its smart smoke alarm and partnered with First Alert on a new $129 detector that will work with current Nest Protect alarms. by  Jennifer Pattison Tuohy If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. Life safety manufacturer First Alert launched a new line of smart smoke and carbon monoxide alarms this week that will work with Google Home. Following Google\u2019s decision to discontinue its Nest Protect smart smoke alarm, the company has announced it\u2019s partnering with First Alert on the First Alert Smart Smoke & Carbon Monoxide (CO) Alarm.  The new alarms will work with the First Alert and Google Home apps but not with any other smart home platforms. They will also be compatible with existing Nest Protect alarms. Ryan Park, senior product director at Resideo, which owns First Alert, told The Verge that they interconnect over Nest\u2019s Weave communication protocol (which uses Thread) to sound all compatible alarms when one is triggered. The notification system can also include any compatible non-connected First Alert alarms you might have installed.  The new First Alert Smart Smoke & CO Alarms will cost $129.99 and will be available in hardwired or battery-powered options later this year in the US and Canada. They\u2019re available now for preorder at FirstAlert.com. Nest Protect alarms work for 10 years from the date of manufacture. They first launched in 2013, so many homeowners (myself included) may need to replace theirs soon. Park says they were designed for easy hardware replacement so that Nest Protect users \u201ccan seamlessly replace their devices.\u201d  The new First Alert alarms have several of the same features found on the Nest Protect. These include automatic safety checkups, a \u201cHeads-up Early Warning\u201d that sends voice and app alerts before an alarm triggers, alerts when an alarm is triggered, and the ability to silence alarms from both the First Alert and Google Home apps. The lineup features a hardwired alarm with a 10-year battery (a requirement in many states) and a battery-powered option, both with backup batteries. The app will send you low battery warnings, so you shouldn\u2019t get those 2AM low battery chirps. Unlike the Protect, the First Alert alarms won\u2019t work as a presence sensor for Google Home\u2019s Home & Away function or feature the Protect\u2019s neat nightlight feature. And while they resemble the Nest Protect, they sadly don\u2019t have the same stylish design. However, Google says they can trigger a live feed from your Nest security cameras in the Home app when an alarm sounds. The new alarms use First Alert\u2019s Precision Detection \u2014 an advanced sensing technology that uses photoelectric sensing. They work over Wi-Fi to connect to the Google Home and First Alert apps. Existing Nest Protects will soon appear in the Google Home app. The new Google Home-compatible alarm comes hot on the heels of competitor Kidde\u2019s launch of a smart smoke alarm that works with Ring at CES this year. The Kidde Smart Smoke Alarm with Ring ($54.97) and the Kidde Smart Smoke and CO Alarm with Ring ($74.97) are hardwired alarms with battery backup and will launch this April at The Home Depot. These connect exclusively to the Ring app via Wi-Fi. First Alert has an existing line of Onelink smoke and CO alarms with Wi-Fi connectivity. However, it phased out its models that worked with Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, and Google Home a while ago. Park says the current Onelink product line will be discontinued over time in favor of the new models. The company also manufactures a Z-Wave smoke and CO alarm that works with Ring Alarm and other platforms, which will continue to be sold.  It\u2019s great to see more smart smoke alarm options; it\u2019s a space that really hasn\u2019t seen a viable competitor to the Nest Protect in the US market. However, this proprietary approach is frustrating, especially now that Matter is here, which is designed to make it easier for manufacturers to integrate with multiple smart home platforms.  Smoke alarms are part of the Matter spec, but none of the recently announced models are compatible with the new smart home standard. Resideo, owner of First Alert, is part of the Connectivity Standards Alliance that oversees Matter. The company recently released a smart thermostat that works with Matter. I\u2019ve asked if there is a plan to make the new smoke alarm compatible. Correction, March 28th: An earlier version of this article misstated the First Alert alarm\u2019s sensing technology. It uses just photoelectric sensing, not a combination of ionization and photoelectric.

If you don't share your WiFi, the day is quickly coming where your smart devices will piggy back on your neighbors WiFi, or the Amazon delivery vehicle, or another smart device, or any connected car that comes near your house. Or just have their own built in chip and antenna for communicating on cellular networks. In addition to the other suggestions, run Pi-hole as your DNS server so you can block the domain lookups these garbage \"features\" require to work. Oh, and block DNS queries at the router unless they're coming from your Pi-hole server to prevent them from hard-coding 8.8.8.8 as their resolver. Yeah, this is a problem.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"With sales from Best Buy and Amazon, there isn't a better time to pick up Beats gear.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Beats products have gotten a bad rap over the years, but they've been successfully revived and reimagined under Apple's stewardship. Gone are the days when Beats were promoting fashion over features and a bass-heavy sound signature. I've tested every single Beats product released over the past two years, and they're not only excellent options for Apple users \u2014 they've also become some of the best price-to-performance audio products for Android fans as well. Now that Amazon's Big Spring Sale is here, we're seeing some of the best prices on Beats audio gear since Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Best of all, competing retailers like Best Buy and Target are getting in on the fun, often with better deals and promotions to challenge Amazon. That's why if you're in the market for new audio gear \u2014 whether it be headphones, earbuds, or speakers \u2014 there's a massively-discounted Beats product to choose from. After testing them all, I'm going to recommend the best Beats deal in each category. If you act fast, you can save up to $100 on the latest Beats gear.  The Beats Solo 4 aren't the best pair of headphones on the market, but you shouldn't sleep on them either. They're all about portability, ease-of-use, and battery life. With a collapsible design, you can fold them up and easily slide them into a bag for safe transport. Solo 4 also weigh just 217 grams, which is a minuscule amount compared to heavier pairs of headphones, like the 384.8-gram AirPods Max. This makes the Beats Solo 4 the perfect gym or on-the-go companion. Their on-ear design and strong clamping force means they won't fall off during your commute or workout, and at the same time, the soft cushions make Solo 4 comfortable. Beats Solo 4: $199.99 $129.99 at Best Buy Beats Solo 4 are a comfortable pair of on-ear headphones that aim to provide the basics at an affordable price point. They're incredibly versatile, with support for lossless audio over wired 3.5mm or USB-C connections. Best of all, you get perfect wireless connectivity with iOS and Android.   Price comparison: Amazon - $129.99 | Target - $49.99 (Target Circle exclusive) \u2705Recommended if: You need a lightweight, versatile pair of wireless headphones lasting over 50 hours on a single charge. \u274cSkip this deal if: You need over-ear headphones with support for active noise-canceling and transparency mode. For me, the killer features are the Beats Solo 4's versatility and battery life. These headphones last up to 50 hours on a single charge, which should last all week for workouts, commuting, and more. When the battery runs out, Solo 4 can actually run without power using the 3.5mm headphone jack. You have plenty of connectivity options here: 3.5mm wired, USB-C wired, or fast wireless pairing with iOS or Android. Of course, there were some compromises made to hit this insane (now discounted even further) price point. The on-ear design may be less comfortable than over-ears for some, and there's no active noise-canceling or transparency mode here. The good news is that if you want all those features, the Beats Studio Pro have them, and they're also $170 off for a limited time. We have a full breakdown of that deal here if you want to learn more. If you want the very best deal on the Beats Solo 4, Target is offering $100 off, but it requires creating a Target Circle account and going through a few hoops. If you want a fully-featured pair of truly-wireless earbuds on a budget, look to the Beats Studio Buds Plus. They're a revised version of the original Beats Studio Buds with better sound quality and features, inspired by the first-generation AirPods Pro. That's why the Studio Buds Plus are sure to sound great, with an in-ear design that pushes audio straight into your ears. Another perk of the Beats Studio Buds Plus is that they're tiny, and that goes for both the earbuds and their charging case. The buds don't have any stems or hooks, so they'll sit nearly flush with your ear when nestled inside. Despite the tiny form factor, you'll get up to nine hours of battery life on a single charge with the earbuds and an additional 27 hours with the USB-C charging case. Beats Studio Buds Plus: $169.99 $129.99 at Best Buy Beats Studio Buds Plus are a great pair of truly-wireless earbuds with excellent features like ANC and transparency mode. They support fast pairing with both Android and iOS, and fit comfortably in your ear with no stem hanging out. Plus, you get 36 total hours of battery life with the included charging case. Price comparison: Amazon - $129.99| Target - $129.99 (Target Circle exclusive) \u2705Recommended if: You want a tiny pair of earbuds with advanced features and excellent Bluetooth 5.2 compatibility. \u274cSkip this deal if: You need the absolute best ANC quality, or need earbuds with a wireless charging case. On top of all that, you get fast pairing with both Android and iOS, and full support for customization and updates with the Beats app for Android. There's ANC and transparency mode support that'll help both block out unwanted noise and let in some of your surroundings. In all, it's going to be hard to find a better set of earbuds at the Beats Studio Buds Plus' discounted $130 price.  The Beats Pill isn't just a speaker. It's also a power bank, with a USB-C port for powering up other devices. You can use it as a beach or pool companion too, with an included lanyard and an IP67 dust and water-resistance rating. And as far as sound quality goes, there's new driver hardware for impressive and full audio with an angled design to push sound right toward your ears. But the fantastic thing about the Beats Pill is its price. Right now, it's available for just $100 \u2014 that's $50 off its typical retail price. To put that in perspective, the Beats Pill's $149.99 retail price was already a discount. The Pill's predecessor, the Pill Plus, retailed for $230 when it released years ago. So, you're not only getting a better product for $80 less than the previous version \u2014 you're also saving $50 on top of that. Beats Pill: $149.99 $99.99 at Best Buy Beats revived the Pill last year, one of the most iconic Bluetooth speakers to ever exist. The appeal isn't just nostalgia, though. This wireless speaker ships with better water resistance, Find My and Find My Device support, and longer battery life.  Price comparison: Amazon - $99.99| Target - $99.99 (Target Circle exclusive) \u2705Recommended if: You want a portable Bluetooth speaker with great sound and long battery life. \u274cSkip this deal if: You need a wireless speaker with a 3.5mm audio jack. There's really only one shortcoming of the Beats Pill, and that's the lack of a 3.5mm audio jack. However, you can use the included USB-C port for audio input and reverse charging, so it's an easy flaw to overlook. That's especially true if you plan to use the speaker wirelessly most of the time. For just $99.99 for a limited time, I think most people will be stunned by how better their music sounds coming through the Beats Pill compared to their phone speakers. After all, this product is quite similar to the Sonos Roam 2 while costing nearly half the price with this discount.  For Android users, the biggest appeal of buying a Beats audio product is getting the latest Apple features in an Android-friendly package. While AirPods Pro 2 or AirPods Max are some of the best headphones on the market, they're not fun to use with Android. By comparison, the Beats Solo 4, Beats Studio Buds Plus, and Beats Pill are all fully-featured on Android. In fact, some of them have Android-exclusive features. It's worth noting that Beats' best competitor to the likes of the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro or the Pixel Buds Pro 2 is the Powerbeats Pro 2, which aren't on sale yet \u2014 they just came out last month. With that being said, every single Beats product on this list is discounted to a fraction of the price of the Powerbeats Pro 2 ($250), so you aren't missing out. If you're in the market for a new pair of headphones or earbuds, or even a Bluetooth speaker, there's a great Beats sale available. These deals won't last forever, so act now if you want to snag one of them.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Instagram has introduced a new fast-forward feature for Reels that allows users to speed through videos by holding down on either edge of the screen. The action plays content at double speed, similar to a feature already available on TikTok. The Meta-owned platform initially limited Reels to 15-second clips but has since expanded the maximum duration to three minutes, making playback controls increasingly necessary for users who want to quickly navigate through longer content. To use the new feature, simply press and hold on the right or left side of their screen while watching a Reel. The video will then play at 2x speed, enabling you to skip to the parts that interest you most. Instagram users have become accustomed to consuming quick, bite-sized content, so the ability to fast-forward increases the likelihood that they will watch Reels through to completion rather than scrolling past longer videos. It's the latest in a series of TikTok-inspired features that Instagram has added in its ongoing effort to compete in the short-form video market. Previously, Instagram introduced Remix, a direct copy of TikTok's Duet functionality, which allows users to create content alongside existing videos. (Via TechCrunch.)

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 2.7%, the S&P 500 declined 2%, and the Dow Jones Industrial average shed 715.8 points, or 1.7%. Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) led the Mag 7 lower, plunging 4.9%, Amazon\u2019s (AMZN) stock fell 4.3%, Tesla slid 3.5%, and Nvidia eased 1.6%.

The ADRs of Toyota (TM), Volkswagen (VWAGY) and Honda (HMC) also declined. Separately, Lululemon\u2019s (LULU) stock plunged 14% after the athleisure wear maker\u2019s sales and profit projections missed analyst expectations. The company has scrambled to update its product line to compete with trendier brands, Reuters (TRI) reported. Chris Grisanti, chief market strategist at MAI Capital Management, said he was surprised by the relatively benign market reaction to the auto tariffs, which were more hawkish than he\u2019d anticipated. He now expects new duties on April 2 to also be hawkish, possibly followed by another muted reaction from investors. Chairman Jerome Powell and his fellow policymakers will probably wait longer to see the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs, especially on inflation, before making any decision on cutting rates, Grisanti told Quartz. \u201cThe only way I see Trump getting the Fed on his side is if he tanks the economy,\u201d Grisanti said. \u201cWe can slice and dice these economic numbers as much as we want, but the Fed is on hold until we get some tariff clarity.\u201d Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

But the outlook for consumers and stubbornly high inflation are adding to the uneasiness. A key gauge of inflation is called the Personal Consumption Expenditures index.

At its March meeting, Chairman Jerome Powell said the impact of tariffs would likely be \u201ctransitory\u201d and the risk of a recession in his estimation is low.  \tPresident Trump and senior administration officials have pressed on with tariffs despite worries on the part of domestic automakers, let alone companies in other sectors.

An overwhelming majority of economists and market watchers expect that businesses and consumers will be burdened by tariffs and an escalating trade war that is likely to result from them.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Today, CoreWeave began trading on the stock market, and it is looking like an inauspicious start for the AI sector. The company had initially hoped to sell shares for $47 to $55 a piece, but began trading at $39 despite being propped up by Nvidia with a massive $250 million order at $40 per share. When you look under the hood, CoreWeave is a dog of a company, with business fundamentals that raise a lot of questions, explaining the less than enthusiastic demand by investors. CoreWeave in recent years found itself in something of an enviable position. Starting out in 2017, it bought GPUs to supply to the cryptocurrency mining industry, only to pivot to AI when that became the hot new trend. CoreWeave is fundamentally a picks and shovels business: It supplies GPUs to an industry that has desperately sought them. Unfortunately though, it appears that the industry does not need them as much today. CoreWeave is going public just as its biggest customer, Microsoft, has pulled back on spending in AI infrastructure, releasing its leases on data centers globally and allowing OpenAI to find other partners. Chips were suddenly in huge demand after OpenAI launched ChatGPT in 2023, but the supply shortage seems to be subsiding in a way that could be bad for CoreWeave. From the Wall Street Journal: The supply shortage has since subsided, and companies say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comparatively easy to buy the required chips. Renting a GPU for an hour cost about $5.50 in mid-2023; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now $1.55, said Evan Conrad, chief executive of San Francisco Compute, a market for GPUs. To put into context the risk here, Microsoft accounted for a whopping 62% of CoreWeave\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenue in 2024. But it has declined optioning a further $12 billion in infrastructure, which had to be taken by OpenAI instead. Furthermore, Nvidia has been a major backer of CoreWeave, only to have the money come straight back as CoreWeave used the money to buy Nvidia GPUs, accounting for 6-7% of Nvidia\u2019s business. Being propped up by just two companies, Microsoft and Nvidia\u00e2\u0080\u0094the former of which is cooling on AI\u00e2\u0080\u0094does not seem like a position of strength. Even worse, CoreWeave is suffocating under a heavy debt burden. Despite bringing in $1.9 billion in 2024 revenue, CoreWeave burned $6 billion last year and $1.1 billion the previous year because of the heavy expenses to build out its AI infrastructure. It has raised eyebrows in the past over carrying nearly $8 billion in debt and using the GPUs themselves as collateral, which certainly seems concerning as GPU prices decline and more efficient AI models require less resources. It appears that CoreWeave needed to go public out of a desperate need to pay down debt. If CoreWeave continues to underwhelm in the days and weeks to come, that could cause problems for other AI companies hoping to go public. And they need it, too\u00e2\u0080\u0094investors demand returns, especially as few companies went public in recent years. Tech companies have fallen on their first of trading in the past only to rebound, so today is not necessarily a death knell for CoreWeave. Interest rates and President Trump\u2019s tariff strategy have been hurting the broader stock market of late. Money-losing, risky companies are less attractive when money can be parked in safer places. CoreWeave, if anything, could be seen as the first barometer of current market stress for GPUs. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and others in the industry have argued that new \u201cthinking\u201d models require more resources, and as more consumers use AI, the demand for GPUs could continue to rise for years to come even as models become more efficient. But again, these are picks and shovels businesses; of course they will say you need more picks and shovels. OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman posted on X yesterday that demand for ChatGPT\u2019s new image generator was \u201cmelting\u201d GPUs. Whether that was a short-lived fad as people made novelty Studio Ghibli knockoffs, or something more sustainable, remains to be seen. Either way, there is no doubt that CoreWeave seems to be on particularly shaky ground. What happens as chip prices continue to decline and major tech giants build their own Nvidia competitors in-house? Why then would CoreWeave be a $32 billion company, as it is expected to be valued on the first day of trading? And what if the AGI boom does not come to pass? This company has been propped up by excessive hype over the past two years, selling picks and shovels, before any other critical AI company has gone public and proven these products are more than glorified next-word predictors with the reliability of an unpaid intern. \u201cNone of these companies are making any profit off of generative AI, and outside of OpenAI, there really isn\u2019t the demand for these services,\u201d said Ed Zitron, a public relations expert and host of Better Offline. \u201cIf there was, Microsoft wouldn\u2019t have just pulled out of 2GW of future compute capacity.\u201d Even should generative AI revolutionize the world, it seems the value will concentrate at the app layer. Foundational language models and hardware are being commoditized. Companies that can find uses cases and can charge for apps will be the ones that stand out. CoreWeave\u2019s three founders will be fine either way. They cashed out $500 million of their holdings between 2023 and 2024.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  TSLA Stock Tesla stock rose by roughly 17% over the past week, despite slipping nearly 5% in Wednesday\u2019s session. Several developments have influenced Tesla\u2019s stock in recent weeks. So, what\u2019s been fueling the recent movement?   President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday a 25% tariff on vehicle imports to the U.S., aiming to promote domestic production. Tesla might emerge as a beneficiary\u2014or at least be less affected\u2014since it manufactures all its U.S.-sold vehicles at its California and Texas plants, exempting them from tariffs. In contrast, rivals like GM and Ford produce EVs in Mexico and may face steeper cost increases. This could make Tesla vehicles more price-competitive and help it grow market share. However, Tesla isn\u2019t completely insulated, as it may incur higher costs from more expensive imported parts. Separately, see Is Google Stock Undervalued At $156? Elon Musk\u2019s prominent role in the new Department of Government Efficiency under the Trump administration has drawn criticism and sparked concerns about his attention to Tesla. However, recent developments suggest he\u2019s turning his focus back to the company. During an all-hands meeting last week, Musk reassured staff about Tesla\u2019s direction and encouraged them to retain their shares, underlining the company\u2019s ambitious future. This renewed engagement may have contributed to the stock\u2019s recent gains. Tesla has seen its European sales drop significantly. According to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association, new Tesla vehicle registrations declined 40% year-over-year in February. This contrasts with the broader EV market, which posted a 26% increase. Multiple reasons may explain the drop: customers may be delaying purchases ahead of the updated Model Y, Europe\u2019s top-selling EV. Additionally, Musk\u2019s political involvement and ties to Trump\u2014who has had strained relations with Europe\u2014might be distancing Tesla from its more progressive European customer base. TSLA stock\u2019s performance over the past four years has been marked by significant volatility compared to the S&P 500. The stock returned 50% in 2021, dropped 65% in 2022, surged 102% in 2023, and climbed 63% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which includes 30 stocks, has experienced much lower volatility and has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the same period. What explains this outperformance? HQ Portfolio stocks, as a group, have delivered stronger returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, offering a smoother ride as reflected in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. With ongoing uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions, including rate cut speculation and global conflicts, TSLA may once again underperform the S&P as it did in 2022\u2014or could potentially post strong gains. We estimate Tesla\u2019s fair value at around $250 per share\u2014roughly 10% below its current market price of $270. We remain cautious for a few reasons. In 2024, Tesla\u2019s vehicle deliveries declined year-over-year for the first time in over ten years. The EV space is becoming more competitive, with Chinese manufacturers gaining global traction. Tesla\u2019s brand is also taking a hit, with resale values dropping and its early-adopter market showing signs of saturation. After the recent stock rally, Tesla\u2019s valuation appears stretched, trading at 100x expected 2025 earnings\u2014a level that could take time to justify.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m having a love\/hate relationship with the Razer Blade 16 right now. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so much to love about this system. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got two of the most powerful mobile components on the block with an AMD Strix Point CPU and an Nvidia Blackwell 5000 series GPU. Together, it makes the Blade 16 an outright AI-centric juggernaut whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gaming, creating content, or working. The OLED panel is stunning to look at as is the laptop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bright, comfortable keyboard and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got a solid suite of ports. And then there\u2019s the hate. The audio could use some work. With a six speaker system, I was expecting a much louder performance. Speaking of loud, the fans can become a bit of a distraction while they fight to keep the system cool. But with an all-metal chassis, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a losing battle. And naturally, the battery life is short lived whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re working or gaming. But the biggest offender is the price. The entry model of the Blade 16 costs $2,999 while my review unit, decked out to the nines, will set you back a hurtful $4,499. I get that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a premium gaming laptop, but damn, that price is eye watering. Still, if you want a thin-and-light gaming laptop with the works, including the AI sprinkles on top, the Razer Blade 16 is a prime contender. Razer Blade 16 The Razer Blade 16's top-of-the-line specs make it a top-of-the-line gaming laptop Pros Cons When it comes to design, only a few things in this life are certain. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west, Pi is irrational and expressed infinitely, and the Razer Blade in all but several cases is a beautiful piece of black CNC aluminum. I stand behind the claim that the Blade is the gamer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s MacBook Pro. But instead of the fruit logo, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that acid green, tri-headed snake emblem in the center with a enticing glow, daring you to open the lid. And when you finally open it, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re greeted with one of the prettiest RGB keyboards in the game by way of Razer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chroma lighting. Affirming its chops as a creator laptop, the notebook has a full SD card reader along with two USB-C ports, a pair of USB-A 3.2 ports, HDMI 2.1, a headset jack, a Kensington lock, and a proprietary power port. The Blade 16 (4.6 pounds) currently holds the title of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cthinnest Blade ever\u00e2\u0080\u009d at 0.59 inches. The notebook is 30% smaller and 15% lighter than its predecessor. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slimmer than the MacBook Pro 16 (0.61 inches). However, the Blade 16 is heavier than the weightiest version of the MacBook Pro 16 (3.4 pounds). But there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a beast beneath that beautiful chassis. The Blade 16 has a Nvidia GeForce 5090 GPU under the hood. Currently one of the most powerful mobile graphic chips on the market, the 5090 can handle just about anything you can throw at it. Built off Nvidia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Blackwell architecture, the chip is designed for both power efficiency and AI neural rendering. With the exception of Black Myth Wukong and Cyberpunk 2077, every game I benchmarked averaged well above 100 frames per second, even on the highest settings at native resolution. The aforementioned frame rates soon matched the other games once Nvidia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s DLSS technology, which uses AI to generate extra frame rates kicked in. Just keep in mind that the fans kick in something fierce when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re gaming or performing something graphics intensive like video editing. And despite a vapor chamber, plus fans working as hard as they can, that all-aluminum chassis can get uncomfortably hot. Although it\u2019s natural to zone in on the GPU in a gaming laptop, the 2.0-GHz AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU with its 32GB of RAM is a force in its own right. One of AMD\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new Strix Point processors, the chip is designed for thin-and-light laptops. And just like the laptop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GPU, the CPU is AI-centric, but doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t skimp on the power efficiency or performance. The Blade 16 chewed through my 75 open Google Chrome tabs with its menagerie of G-Suite docs, social media, and videos. Batch resizing large caches of photos was a breeze as was cutting together video. I know I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked a lot about gaming, but the Blade is equally a creator-class system, capable of delivering a stellar visual experience. Colors on the Blade\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 16-inch, 2560 x 1600 OLED display are so vivid, sometimes it felt like the notebook was trying to sear the color into my retinas. Whether I watched Sakamoto Days, Paradise, or Found, the contrasts and colors were excellent. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also great for photo and video editing. And thanks to the 240Hz refresh rate and Nvidia G-Sync software, I never encountered any unsightly tearing or latency as I played Assassin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Creed Shadows. However, with all the power the Blade 16 wields, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got to be a weakness. And like most gaming laptops, the Achilles Heel lies in the battery life. I ran the PCMark 10 Modern Office test which mimics typical office use (spreadsheets, social media scrolling, video conferencing, web surfing, etc.) with the display set to 50% brightness and the 90Whr battery only lasted 3 hours and 36 minutes. The time dropped to 1:24 on the gaming test. I managed to squeeze out four hours in actual use, but the game tapped out after an hour and ten minutes during Assassin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Creed Shadows. And what I could hear while gaming wasn\u2019t impressive. Similar to the MacBook Pro 16, the Blade 16 has six speakers and a smart AMP. It also has spatial audio care of THX. However, the speakers lack volume, especially when compared to last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Razer Blade 18 or my 2023 MacBook Pro 16. And the bass is all but non-existent even with the four audio presets. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disappointing, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not something a good gaming headset can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fix. So yes, the battery life is fleeting, but that\u2019s to be expected with a gaming laptop! They\u2019re all bad at battery life! But I do wish the audio was a bit louder and the fans a bit quieter, and we can agree the price will do a number on many a budget.\u00c2\u00a0But despite the minor flaws this is still a premium system, and man, I love a premium system. They\u2019re a showcase of the best the industry has to offer. That is the story of the 2025 Razer Blade too. Powered by some of the most powerful mobile components from AMD and Nvidia, it\u2019s all but guaranteed that the Blade will push through most workloads like Saquon Barkley cuts through D-lines.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  A Google signage is seen outside their headquarter in Warsaw, Poland, March 21, 2025.   Despite a 18% stock decline this year, driven by investor apprehension over potential trade tensions \u2013 including President Trump\u2019s recently proposed automobile tariffs and potential increases on European and Canadian goods \u2013 we find Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock to be an attractive pick at its current price of about $156. This conclusion is supported by our analysis comparing Google\u2019s present valuation with its operating performance in recent years, alongside its current and historical financial standing. While the current administration\u2019s tariff and immigration policies have rekindled inflation anxieties, hinting at potential economic turbulence that could impact tech stocks, it\u2019s crucial to recognize that these near-term macroeconomic headwinds do not alter Google\u2019s long-term prospects. Separately, another stock moved almost 150% over the past two years. See What\u2019s Behind The 150% Rise In Amazon Stock? Furthermore, Google has demonstrated greater resilience than the broader market during one of the two recent economic downturns. Our detailed assessment of Alphabet across key metrics such as Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience confirms the company\u2019s very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed in the following sections. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, GOOG stock looks slightly expensive compared to the broader market. Alphabet's Revenues have seen notable growth over recent years. Alphabet\u2019s profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Alphabet's balance sheet looks very strong. GOOG stock has seen an impact that was slightly better than the benchmark S&P 500 index in one of the two recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Alphabet's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: \u2022 Growth: Very Strong   \u2022 Profitability: Very Strong   \u2022 Financial Stability: Extremely Strong   \u2022 Downturn Resilience: Neutral   \u2022 Overall: Very Strong Alphabet\u2019s current valuation of approximately 6x trailing revenues, while slightly higher than the S&P 500 average, remains marginally below its own five-year price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 6.2x. We believe that this positioning creates an attractive entry point. The company's promising earnings growth potential, driven by strategic AI initiatives and the continued momentum in its cloud division, suggests that a premium valuation is not only justified but potentially undervalued. The strength of Alphabet\u2019s performance across key business segments supports our view that Google stock represents a compelling investment opportunity at $165. The company\u2019s ability to innovate, particularly in AI and cloud technologies, positions it to potentially expand its valuation multiple beyond historical averages, making it an attractive pick for investors seeking growth and technological leadership. While it looks like there is upside to GOOG stock, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid- and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  AMZN Stock   Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) has declined by around 10% so far this year, as investors grow increasingly concerned about the possibility of escalating trade disputes. President Trump has floated a 25% tariff on auto imports and indicated that more tariffs could be levied on European and Canadian products if he believes they harm the U.S. economy.[1] Still, AMZN stock is up 145% when measured from early 2023, thanks largely to three key drivers: We'll take a closer look at these dynamics. For more details, check out our dashboard on Why Amazon Stock Moved. While AMZN has seen a strong run-up, if you\u2019re looking for upside potential with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has beaten the S&P with returns exceeding 91% since inception. Amazon\u2019s solid revenue growth is fueled by long-term trends in e-commerce, streaming, and digital advertising. As the leading player in U.S. online retail with a 38% market share, Amazon benefits from multiple revenue streams, especially through its innovative advertising model, which generates income from both ad placements and resulting sales. A key to this growth has been Amazon\u2019s diversification strategy, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) playing a major role. From 2020 to 2024, AWS grew at an average annual rate of 24.4%, far exceeding the growth of its North America (13.2%) and International (8.7%) operations. This underscores the impact of Amazon\u2019s long-term investments in infrastructure, including data centers, e-commerce tools, and logistics networks. Looking forward, while AWS remains a crucial growth engine, Amazon faces rising competition in cloud computing. Rivals like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are gaining ground. Microsoft\u2019s partnership with OpenAI and its aggressive AI investments could give it an edge, while Google continues to expand its generative AI offerings. These developments highlight the need for Amazon to continue innovating to maintain its leadership in the tech sector. After years of scaling operations, Amazon is now beginning to realize the payoff of its strategic investments. Its adaptability and focus across high-growth industries continue to reinforce its position in the digital economy. AWS has played a pivotal role in Amazon\u2019s financial evolution, helping to significantly boost profitability. From 2022 to 2024, Amazon\u2019s operating margin surged from 2.4% to 10.8% \u2014 a five-fold increase. This improved profitability, paired with strong revenue growth and AWS\u2019s rapid expansion, has shifted investor sentiment in Amazon\u2019s favor. During this period, Amazon\u2019s price-to-sales multiple nearly doubled from 1.7x to 3.4x, signaling renewed confidence in its growth outlook. This rebound came amid broader market turmoil, especially the inflation-driven market sell-off in 2022. At the time, Amazon stock dropped sharply \u2014 down 52% from a January 2022 peak of $170.40 to $81.82 by December. That decline outpaced the S&P 500\u2019s 25.4% fall. It wasn\u2019t until February 2024 that AMZN recovered to its prior high, demonstrating both the stock\u2019s volatility and resilience. Now trading at $200, Amazon's stock carries a P\/S ratio of 3.4x, roughly in line with its five-year average of 3.2x. Still, there are solid reasons to believe the multiple could rise further. Amazon\u2019s aggressive investments in artificial intelligence offer significant upside across several business segments. Within AWS, a surge in AI-driven app development is expected to drive increased demand for cloud infrastructure. On the retail side, AI-powered enhancements in product recommendations, search, and personalization could meaningfully lift performance. These improvements are likely to boost conversion rates, increase average order values, and improve advertising efficiency both on Amazon\u2019s platform and beyond. Sales are expected to grow at a low double-digit pace in the coming years, with profits projected to grow even faster. With rising profitability, ongoing AWS momentum, and sustained dominance in e-commerce, Amazon may see further expansion in its valuation multiple. Investors could view these strategies as strong catalysts for future gains. We estimate Amazon\u2019s valuation at $244 per share \u2014 about 20% above current levels \u2014 based on a P\/S multiple of 4.1x, 20% higher than the current 3.4x. Notably, the increase in AMZN stock over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While AMZN may still have room to climb, it\u2019s worth exploring how Amazon\u2019s Peers stack up on key financial metrics. You can find more comparisons across industries on Peer Comparisons.

The word on the street is that the authors originally intended to use \"they\/their\", but Elon objected, so they used the next best thing. ground truths are simply a basis for training, they are the \"knowns\".  Ground truths do not have to be true, they can be outright lies.  It doesn't matter that an AI treats lies as ground truths, it only matters that you assume that they don't. Ground truth is what you get when you actually go somewhere and muck around down in the mud. Doesn't sound like a bad description of X. Unless you're a \"data scientist\" in which case it means whatever someone assumes to be true, which is also a pretty decent description of X. This was probably a financial shenanigan that allowed him to pay them off by diverting venture capital money that was supposed to go to creating an AI company. I think this was the answer. Yeah I've always said that apparently Billionares dont have to follow laws.... unless they get caught screwing over other billionares, that is. Absolutely.Musk's purchase was heavily leveraged against Tesla stock, which is falling in value.Dude was one margin call away from losing -everything-, and that margin call was very near.Saving himself by redirecting the xAI investors money to cover his debts instead of, well, developing xAI is a bad look, and almost assuredly violated an assload of laws> But since we are in a post-law society, that part really doesn't matter. On to the next grift. Hmmm...actually my thought was that now xAI has the right to train on all material from twitter no matter how several current court cases turn out.

Even his own AI says Elon does nothing but spread misinformation. https:\/\/www.latintimes.com\/mus... [latintimes.com] They updated grok.

We have to start containing social media within national boundaries, make it difficult for the average person to access across borders and at least make the agitprop campaigns require some effort to insert and control content. Clearly a way for Musk to get out of his disastrous Twitter investment.   He grossly overpaid for Twitter, super underwater.  He can pretend that xAI is worth 80 billion based on some bulls--t latest round of investment.   Twitter is 'bought' with the fake xAI stock, and then Musk is able to divest his money during this peak AI frenzy...and later whoever has xAI investments takes the losses.

Basically a valuation is just a random number pulled out of thin air. Say you're going for investment funding, and your VC says they'll pick up 10% at $100M. That means your valuation is $1B - because the VC firm is buying 10% of it for $100M, so 100% of the  It's worse. You think this is fraud on the part of Musk, but in fact it's actually delusion on behalf of the financial industry.

Twitter's value was diminished so much after Leon took the helm that it was worth a fraction of some tech start-up that hasn't yet reached version 1.0 ?

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Business Insider Edition  Get ready to pay more for that Ferrari.          On Thursday, the Italian carmaker announced that its cars will cost up to 10% more under President Donald Trump's new tariffs.               The price hikes will apply to all models except the 296, SF90, and Roma. Cars imported before April 2 will not be affected, Ferrari wrote on its website.               The price tag of any other Ferrari that wasn't in the US by that date will climb, the company said.               Ferrari makes all of its cars in Maranello in northern Italy.               With Ferrari prices ranging from around $250,000 for a Portofino to over $3.5 million for limited-edition models like the F80, the price hike stands to add tens of thousands of dollars to the cost of a vehicle in the US.               Consider the Ferrari Purosangue, which retails for about $433,000 in the US. Under Trump's tariffs, the vehicle could cost up to an extra $43,000.               Ferrari said the tariffs could take a bite out of its profits.               \"On such basis, Ferrari confirms its financial targets for 2025, with a potential risk of 50 basis points reduction on profitability percentage margins,\" the company wrote on its site.               Trump on Wednesday signed an order implementing a 25% tariff on auto imports, which will apply to all cars and light trucks not made in the US.               In a note on Wednesday, Wedbush analysts described the tariffs as a \"hurricane-like headwind\" to foreign and domestic automakers. They estimated the tariffs would push car prices up between $5,000 and $10,000.               While Trump's announcement sent auto stocks tumbling, Tesla emerged as a winner, with its stock jumping 4% on Thursday. Tesla's vehicles sold in the US are made domestically at its factories in California and Texas.       Trump said he did not consult with Tesla CEO Elon Musk on the auto tariff, citing potential conflicts of interest.               The president suggested the new tariff could boost domestic manufacturing growth if foreign-owned auto companies expand or create new plants in the US to bypass the import fees.               The auto tariff adds to existing duties on imports like steel and aluminum from Canada, Mexico, and China. Trump has repeatedly set and extended deadlines for these tariffs, only to walk the extensions back during trade negotiations, heightening tensions between the US and its allies to the north and south.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"When Coca-Cola launched its Dasani bottled water brand in the U.S. in 1999, the product proved amazingly successful. By 2004, it had captured 24 percent of the U.S. market. The stage looked set for successful expansion into Europe, beginning with a major launch in the UK in February 2004.  Less than two months later, however, all UK production had ceased. On March 19, 2004, Coca-Cola announced a recall of half a million bottles and immediately withdrew Dasani from that country. So, what the heck went wrong? From the start, it was quickly apparent that the massive beverage company had misjudged the UK market, failing to take into account the fact that British consumers overwhelmingly favored bottled water sourced from natural springs.  Dasani falls into a different category. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actually purified water, meaning water that has been taken from a regular tap supply and then treated. But demand for purified water in the UK is pretty low. According to a 2015 report, purified water accounted for just 2 percent of the bottled water market in the UK.  Unlike their cousins across the pond, British people tend not to really mind drinking straight tap water, as their water supplies date back to as early as the Roman era. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only been over the last decade that at-home tap water filters have really taken off in the country, meaning there was already a cultural divide with UK shoppers by the time Coca-Cola unleashed Dasani to the masses.  Before the product even launched in February 2004, the Dasani brand was also hamstrung by an August 2003 article that ran in The Grocer magazine, which claimed that the water was sourced from Sidcup\u00e2\u0080\u0094an unglamorous suburb of London.  The national press quickly jumped on the story, playing down the water treatment process and lambasting the company for attempting to sell ordinary tap water at a markup.  Unfortunately for Coca-Cola, the situation bore more than a passing resemblance to an episode of one of the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most beloved sitcoms,\u00c2\u00a0Only Fools and Horses. In the season seven episode, \u00e2\u0080\u009cMother Nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Son,\u00e2\u0080\u009d cockney chancer Del Boy makes a fortune selling bottled water from his \u00e2\u0080\u0098Peckham Spring,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 only for it to be revealed that the beverage is, in fact, ordinary tap water from a burst main pipe.  Even though Coca-Cola had never claimed Dasani was anything but processed tap water, endless comparisons were made, with the situation becoming a national running joke. The final blow to the Dasani brand in the UK back in 2004 came from a report from the Food Standards Agency (FSA), the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s public health and food safety regulatory body. According to their findings, the purified water contained potentially unsafe levels of bromate, a chemical that can be carcinogenic and is known to lead to nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain when ingested in large amounts. The chemical is even linked to various cancers and may lead to kidney damage, as well as other health issues when ingested at levels thousands of times higher than is typically allowed in public water supplies. On March 19, 2004, Coca-Cola voluntarily issued a recall on about 500,000 Dasani bottled water products in the UK. The company also issued a statement, claiming that the bromate contamination had occurred during their regular practice of adding calcium to the drink. Under UK health laws, the limit for bromate in water was 10 parts per billion (ppb); the Dasani samples returned results of between 10 and 22 ppb. After the voluntary recall, some marketing experts declared that it would be next to impossible to re-launch Dasani in the UK. Due to the controversy, Coca-Cola subsequently canceled planned Dasani brand launches around other parts of Europe.  As of today, you still can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find Dasani on British shelves, and whether or not that might ever change in the future is still up for debate. But one thing\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for sure: Folks in the UK weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly clamoring for purified tap water in the first place.

The transaction values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion, according to CNBC. \u201cxAI has acquired X in an all-stock transaction. The combination values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion ($45B less $12B debt),\u201d Musk tweeted Friday evening.\u00c2\u00a0 Musk purchased Twitter in October 2022 for about $44 billion, changing the name of the company to X, and founded xAI just five months later as an artificial intelligence company.

Musk had previously said he wouldn\u2019t reinstate Jones, who had been banned in 2018, but apparently changed his mind about a year after buying the site.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"The Ultra and the new slimmer Find X8s series are launching in China on April 10.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Oppo is gearing up for a new launch event in China next month, wherein the company will be announcing a bunch of new products under the popular Find X8 series, including the Find X8 Ultra, the successor to the Find X7 Ultra. The company has started teasing the launch date set for April 10 \u2014 on Weibo accounts alongside Oppo Find series product manager Zhou Yi Bao, who also seems to be revealing important insights into the upcoming new phones. The teaser images indicate that we should be seeing Hasselblad integration staying intact with the Find X8 Ultra. The device is all set to take on the latest flagships in the market again with its two periscopic telephoto cameras. In the latest Weibo post (via Notebookcheck), Oppo has confirmed that it has improved light intake on both the sensors, wherein the 3x periscopic lens manages to gain 150% light intake and the 6x lens increases light intake by 251% \u2014 when compared to the predecessor Find X7 Ultra. Very recently, Bao has also shared a photo shot of the upcoming flagship Find X8 Ultra and compared the same shot taken by the latest iPhone 16 Pro. When put side by side, the Oppo phone has managed to outshine the iPhone 16 Pro as the shot was captured in a darker environment. The red neon lighting in the photo is bright red as seen on the X8 Ultra, whereas the iPhone turned it orange. Similarly, the person\u2019s avatar is seen in blue on the iPhone 16 Pro, whereas in the Find X8 Ultra, the person is more clear and real, as noted by Bao, and all thanks to Ultra\u2019s night portrait professional lens alongside a new Danxia color lens. Bao has further confirmed that along with the Find X8 Ultra, the company is also announcing two new Find X8s series phones on April 10. The Find X8s will have a 6.3-inch display, whereas the Find X8s Plus comes with a 6.59-inch panel. Both phones are believed to be carrying a lighter form factor yet having a strong build and a large glacier battery capacity.  Other expected product launches from the upcoming event include Oppo Watch X2 Mini and Oppo Pad 4 Pro. It is still unclear whether the Find X8 Ultra launch is limited to China or global markets would witness the handset as well, because previous Ultra iterations were limited to China.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"In March 2023, the government decided a former air base one mile from a small rural village in Essex should be used to house male asylum seekers. Two years on, what is it like for the local community and migrants living at MDP Wethersfield? A few minutes' drive from Wethersfield is the picture-postcard village of Finchingfield. Adorned with tea rooms, pubs and a duck pond surrounded by Georgian homes, it is less than two miles from the migrant accommodation. The Finchingfield Lion pub was packed on a Friday afternoon, with a roaring log burner warming the locals. Landlady Jacqui Braithwaite says the direct impact on the community from the asylum seekers was \"negligible\" and residents \"rarely\" saw small groups of people from the base walking around the area. But she feels the centre has affected the area in a different way. \"The impact on the people here has been really profound. It has divided us - the whole community. There were probably loads of racists here before but it never showed,\" she says. \"When the asylum [centre] happened, people just started saying things and they felt OK saying them. Horrible, racist things. \"I have people who don't come into my pub anymore. I came out as non-racist. I did a post that said they are just people, they are not bad people, they have been given a really crap hand and they are trying to find a way to live, to find a life. \"People are blaming them for everything. Anything that gets nicked or any can thrown out of a car into the hedge rows, all of a sudden it is 'because of asylum seekers'.\" Philip O'Reilly is sitting with his spaniel nursing a pint of local bitter in Jacqui's pub. He says he is neither for nor against the asylum seekers at the base. \"I'm more concerned when I or my wife go shopping in Braintree,\" he says. \"Without a doubt, there are groups of men not native to England that seem to gather on corners, more on market day.  \"I have had one or two of my female neighbours who feel uncomfortable in Braintree town centre.\" Tony Clarke-Holland lives metres from MDP Wethersfield's perimeter fence, which was previously one of the remotest areas of Essex. Over the past two years, he described the base as having become a hub of activity again. He says: \"It's become our new norm. It impacts everyone's life, sometimes it's more of a mental and intangible thing. You are living with it daily.  \"We hear noise and bits and bobs on occasion. Before, it was a very quiet area.\" Alan Mackenzie, the chair of the campaign group Fields Association, says when the decision was announced \"there was a tremendous amount of concern by everybody in the area, because there is no experience of anything like this\".  He says: \"[Wethersfield] is a village of just 700 people. Having the possibility of 1,700 asylum seekers descending not that far away on a small village was a serious concern.\" Yet, he adds, \"a lot of those fears haven't come to fruition\". The estimated 500 migrants \"seems to be a number which is kept under sensible control up at the base\". Source: BBC\/Home Office  Among those living at MDP Wethersfield is Kareem, 25, who is part of the Bidoon minority in Kuwait. He recently arrived in the UK by boat from Calais.  On a Sunday evening Kareem, alongside about two dozen other men who are mostly from the Middle East, Africa and Asia, dons a football kit and borrowed boots to enthusiastically kick a ball across an icy pitch. The players are all asylum seekers living at Wethersfield, who compete in Wethersfield FC \u2013 a football league amongst the men at the base.  Kareem describes the accommodation at Wethersfield as \"great\".  \"I love the camp, I love where I live... I want to be in the UK instead of any other country in the world, because the UK is helping everyone who don't have rights.\" He says his community is denied education, access to work and citizenship in Kuwait. The UK government says the Bidoon people have been classed as \"illegal residents\" by the Kuwaiti state since the 1960s. Liubov Liushnenko, 28, is a Ukrainian refugee and works for the charity Changing Lives, which provides sporting activities at the base, such as football, table tennis and volleyball. She says the men have always treated her with respect. \"I feel safe, I feel respectful. They are wonderful,\" she says. \"In their countries, in their religions, they are not allowed to say something bad about a woman. I feel absolutely safe there.\" English, art and music lessons are also provided with support from the Home Office and Braintree District Council. Another player, Saleh, 28, from Yemen, said: \"It's like normal, it's fine on Wethersfield. It's not better than other places, but it is fine.\" In 2023, some asylum seekers held protests outside the base over their living conditions, such as the quality of food and lack of activities. Some of the men at the time reported there was \"almost nightly fighting\" between different groups and a 2024 British Red Cross assessment found more than 70% of  residents did not feel safe on the site. Yafet, 25, from Eritrea, says: \"It's fine now. I have not seen this fighting during my time [at Wethersfield]... people love each other.\" The Home Office said asylum seekers should stay for a maximum of nine months at Wethersfield and then be placed in dispersal accommodation \u2013 usually shared housing in towns and cities. Yusuf, from Sudan, stayed at Wethersfield for six months and since December has been living in Colchester. He has just received his refugee status and wants to train as a plumber.  \"I was scared from the first time I entered [Wethersfield]. But the time when I was there for six months, I have seen there was nothing to fear about it.\" A Home Office spokesperson said: \"We remain of the belief that the Wethersfield site provides fully adequate and functional accommodation.\" Follow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"     A strong Wi-Fi signal and enhanced parental controls are a must, but customizing with your favorite Minions character puts the icing on the cake.           Article updated on March 28, 2025 at 6:39 AM PDT        CNET\u2019s expert staff reviews and rates dozens of new products and services each month, building on more than a quarter century of expertise. One thing being a parent has taught me is that you have to find ways to make the boring things fun. A simple design change or unexpected functionality can help bring excitement to the otherwise mundane, like brushing your teeth. (Thank you, singing Elmo toothbrush!)\u00a0 I\u2019ve discovered the same is true of internet routers and Wi-Fi extenders. When it comes to electronic devices in the home, is there anything more boring than a router? They\u2019re small, probably a bland off-white or gray color, have no screen and don\u2019t even play music. There are blinking lights occasionally, but those usually signify problems with your internet connection. Routers play a crucial role in our home internet connection by creating our Wi-Fi network. It\u2019s an important but not necessarily flashy job. Still, there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t have a little fun with our routers. These devices will help you do just that. Plus, using your own router can save you a good bit on your internet bill. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m still chuckling from watching Despicable Me 4 or the fact that this quality, quirky router is so cheap, but I dig Davolink\u2019s Minions-themed routers. Available in \u201cBob\u201d or \u201cKevin,\u201d these Wi-Fi 6 routers support WPA3 encryption, the latest router security protocol and parental control settings. Depending on which Minion you choose to join your clan, your router will feature dual- or tri-band frequency and a 2.7GB or 5.4GB transfer rate. Bob is the cheaper option, but you\u2019ll get a better performance from Kevin. If you have an Eero Wi-Fi system, newer Amazon Echo smart speakers, including the Echo Pop Kids, will double as a Wi-Fi extender for your network. Along with fun designs featuring Marvel or Disney characters, the Echo Pop Kids comes with six months of Amazon Kids Plus, easy-to-use parental controls and \u201cHey Disney\u201d functionality. It\u2019s great for playing music and telling bedtime stories while also boosting your Wi-Fi network. Sometimes you have to sacrifice fun for safety. The Gryphon AX mesh router doesn\u2019t resemble any cute characters, but that\u2019s because it takes its job -- parental controls -- seriously. The device equips parents with \u201cactive content monitoring, app and website blocking, individualized time limits and comprehensive insights so you can better monitor your kids\u2019 screen time.\u201d Aside from the parental controls, the router itself is impressive, featuring Wi-Fi 6 technology, tri-band frequency and coverage of up to 3,000 square feet. Newer parents know that, along with the sound machine, a good nightlight is crucial to a sound night\u2019s sleep. While most nightlights simply plug in, light up and have no other function, the Todaair device will also serve as a Wi-Fi extender. I\u2019ll admit the mushroom design is different, but if you\u2019re interested in a nightlight that can boost your Wi-Fi coverage, this is perhaps the best and only option you\u2019ll find. Kids play video games, and, if you\u2019re like me, parents play video games, too. Depending on the number of players and devices in your household, gaming can take quite a toll on your connection. The solution is a good gaming router, like the Asus RT-AX86U, CNET\u2019s pick for best gaming router overall. Not only does it look cool, the router is designed to keep latency low and speeds high, perfect for online gaming. If you\u2019re in the market for routers and Wi-Fi extenders, be sure to check out our other recommendations: And for more on how to find the best internet provider for your home and make the most of your internet connection, visit the CNET internet hub page.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"ByAaron Stanley  ByAaron Stanley,  Contributor.  Image of a 20 Mexican Peso bill which is equivalent to one US dollar (19.738800 pesos) in Mexico ... More City, on June 2, 2022. - A stable political outlook in the face of uncertainty in Colombia, Brazil and Chile, and an attractive financial yield are encouraging a surprisingly strong Mexican peso, despite the country's tepid economic outlook, experts say. (Photo by Pedro PARDO \/ AFP) (Photo by PEDRO PARDO\/AFP via Getty Images) US dollar-pegged stablecoins like USDT and USDC are all the rage this year, but tokens denominated in local market currencies are starting to find product market fit. Bitso, the Mexico-based crypto platform with operations across Latin America, has launched a new stablecoin pegged to the Mexican peso. Announced at the Merge Buenos Aires conference on March 25, the MXNB stablecoin will live on the Arbitrum network, an Ethereum Layer 2 network that has become a popular rail for stablecoins in emerging market countries. The idea is that MXNB will allow foreign companies doing business in Mexico to more easily convert in and out of Mexican pesos, thereby making it easier to offer products and services to Mexican customers. Similar products have gained traction in the Latin America region as of late. Bitso recently joined forces with Mercado Bitcoin and Foxbit to launch a Brazilian real-pegged stablecoin called BRL1. Brazil\u2019s Braza Bank announced a real-pegged token of its own on the XRP Ledger in February. These products join the party of other BRL-paired stablecoins such as BRZ \u2014 issued by Transfero, and BRLA \u2014 issued by BRLA Digital \u2014 that have been operative in the market for several years. USD stablecoins comprise the majority of the market due to their liquidity and convenience. They provide an easy way access to dollars for those seeking a store of value, and are ubiquitous in the crypto trading world. However, soft currencies don\u2019t possess these same characteristics, and users don\u2019t generally want to hold them for any prolonged period if there are better options available. So why the newfound interest in these stablecoins pegged to local currencies? The short answer is market access. These tokens serve as a bridge for individuals and businesses looking to on and off-ramp into new markets to offer products and services denominated in the local currency. Ben Reid, Head of Stablecoins at Bitso Business, explained: Stablecoins are now understood to be a fast, cost-effective solution to this problem, offering an alternative to traditional fiat rails for expanding access to foreign markets. In this regard, local stablecoins can be seen as the bridge between global capital and local usability. They enable international businesses to collect payments and pay salaries, vendors and customers in local currency and via local payment rails like Pix, in the case of Brazil. Lucas Giorgio, co-founder of BRLA Digital, explained that drop-off rates can be as high as 80% in Latin America when users are forced to transact in US dollars rather than their local currency. For Bitso, these local currency stablecoins are a core component of its business strategy for the remainder of the year. It has launched a subsidiary called Juno, that will live underneath its Bitso Business division, that is focused on issuance and management of digital assets like stablecoins. Bitso Business will also host Latin America\u2019s first conference devoted to stablecoins on August 27-28 in Mexico City.                            Why the newfound interest in non-dollar pegged stablecoins? Ben Reid, Head of Stablecoins at Bitso Business, explained that the value proposition of stablecoins denominated in local currencies is market access for international players.        , crypto trading on international exchanges (USD-denominated trading pairs tend to be more liquid)  ","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Published onMarch 28, 2025  Way back in October 2013, a young company called Nest Labs launched the Nest Protect, one of the first smart smoke\/CO2 alarms to enter the burgeoning smart home market. Only a few months later, Google had swept in and bought Nest for $3.2 billion. Unbelievably, since then, not much has changed: Google still makes the Nest Protect ($99 at Amazon) and has only moderately increased its price over the past 12 years. Today, however, the company is finally sending the Nest Protect off to pasture. Starting now, production of the Nest Protect will cease, and Google will sell through all remaining stock. Instead of producing its own replacement for the Nest Protect, Google is looking to a partner to fill the gap. First Alert \u2014 owned by a company called Resideo \u2014 is co-launching with Google the new First Alert Smart Smoke & Carbon Monoxide Alarm. Although a different firm makes it, the First Alert device is basically a Nest Protect 2 in that it integrates with existing Nest Protects and fully supports the Google Home app. In other words, if you have multiple Nest Protects throughout your house and one of them fails, you can just swap in one of these new First Alert alarms, and it will perform in pretty much the same fashion. In fact, this new device even looks a lot like the Nest Protect, as you can see in the official image below: The First Alert Smart Smoke & Carbon Monoxide Alarm will go on sale in the United States and Canada \u201cin the coming months\u201d for a projected price of $129, the same price as the original Nest Protect. You can pre-order it now at First Alert\u2019s site. If you\u2019re worried that this news means any Nest Protects you own will become paperweights, don\u2019t worry. Google is still committed to offering security updates to all Nest Protect devices through their individual expiration dates. It was never an official Made by Google product, but the 2018 Nest x Yale Lock was clearly developed in partnership with Google and Nest. The smart lock integrated smoothly with the Google Home platform and remains, to this day, the only smart lock with the Nest branding. Unfortunately, this lock is also being retired today. As with the Nest Protect, Google and Yale will sell through the remaining stock of the device and cease to make any additional units. Like the Nest Protect, Google and Yale will continue to support the Nest x Yale Lock with security updates. Additionally, Google will even integrate passcode management support and other new features with the Google Home app, making it still an excellent investment (or worth holding onto if you already have one). To replace the Nest x Yale Lock, Yale is launching a smart lock called the Yale Smart Lock with Matter, which you can see in the image above. This will be the next-best thing to replace the Nest x Yale Lock. Yale tells us this new smart lock will seamlessly integrate with the Google Home ecosystem \u2014 including Nest doorbells \u2014 along with general Matter-certified devices. It supports multiple entry methods, including passcode, app triggering, or even a conventional key. The lock will be available in three finishes (Ash, Matte Black, and Snow) and will cost $170. It will be available \u201clater this summer.\u201d","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Business Insider Edition  It's not easy being a Tesla owner right now \u2014 and it could be about to get worse thanks to rising insurance premiums.          The public backlash against Elon Musk and DOGE has turned Tesla into a target, with the company's vehicles, showrooms, and chargers hit by vandalism, gunfire, and suspected arson in recent weeks.               Some drivers have seen their cars graffitied and egged, and two Cybertruck owners previously told Business Insider they faced thousands of dollars in damages after objects were hurled at their vehicles during a Mardi Gra parade in New Orleans.               Fears that their vehicles might be targeted have already pushed some Tesla owners to sell up, and those that remain could face rising insurance costs as providers hike rates in response to the vandalism spree.               Average insurance premiums for Teslas are already higher than those for competing vehicles and have been steadily climbing in recent months.               The average premium for full coverage car insurance on a Model 3 hit $3,495 in March, according to data from Bankrate, up $101 from January, compared to the national average of $2,678.               The cost of insuring a Model Y, Tesla's best-selling vehicle, hit $3,771 in March, while average premiums on the Model X have risen more than $300 in three months to $5,459.               Tesla insurance premiums are now significantly higher than other EVs and hybrids including the Chevy Bolt, Toyota Highlander hybrid, and Ford F150 Lightning, per Bankrate's data.               Premiums for Model Y and 3 vehicles have risen 29% and 24% over the past year, compared to 10% for the average US vehicle, separate data from Insurify showed.               Shannon Martin, an insurance analyst for Bankrate, told Business Insider the rise in insurance rates reflected losses from 2024 rather than any recent uptick in vandalism \u2014 but added that insurance buyers should expect rates to rise in the next year if the problem persists.               \"I would expect if this keeps happening at this rate, definitely by 2026 renewals, people will start seeing a change, maybe as soon as toward the last quarter of 2025,\" Martin said.               Martin compared the situation to the 2023 \"Kia Boys\" saga, which saw insurance providers hike premiums or refuse to insure Hyundai and Kia vehicles after a wave of TikTok-inspired thefts.               High insurance costs have long been a problem for Tesla owners, spurring the company to launch its own insurance provider in 2019.               Martin said the average insurance premiums on a Model 3, Tesla's cheapest model, were closer to luxury vehicles like BMWs.               The company's most high-profile new customer, President Donald Trump, summed up the reason insuring a Tesla is so pricey \u2014 \"everything's computer.\"               \"Tesla has a lot more cameras, a lot more computer chips than most other electric vehicles on the market,\" said Martin.               \"They have cameras not just on the inside of the vehicle but also on the outside of the vehicle. So even a small fender bender would create very expensive repairs for the Tesla owner and the insurance company,\" she added.               Tesla did not respond to a request for comment, sent outside normal working hours.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Business Insider Edition  Stepping into a TWG Tea store in Singapore is a sensory overload.          The store is designed to be ultra-maximalist. Golden tins of hundreds of different tea blends are stacked on the walls. Warm ambient lighting and polished checkered floors make the space feel like a palace.               While the interiors and the products' packaging scream luxury, the packaged teas start at around 30 Singapore dollars, or $22.               If you dine in, you can choose from an extensive tea book consisting of over 800 tea varieties. Servings of the selected teas \u2014 brought out in round, gold teapots \u2014 start at SG$12, containing about three cups worth of drink.               Taha Bouqdib, the CEO of the Singaporean company V3 Gourmet, which owns TWG Tea and Bacha Coffee, told BI that keeping prices low is a top priority.               \"When you enter our store, even from $10, you are our client already,\" he said.               TWG Tea's sister brand, Bacha Coffee, offers the same luxe experience. Red and gold boxes of coffee blends are stacked on the ceiling, and products are displayed on shiny golden shelves.               Like TWG Tea, it, too, offers affordable luxury. The Bacha Coffee outlet in Marina Bay Sands, one of Singapore's biggest malls, sells croissants for SG$10 and pre-packaged coffee boxes for SG$32.               TWG Tea started in Singapore in 2008 and is now sold in over 100 locations globally. Bacha Coffee, founded in Morocco in 1910 and revived by V3 Gourmet in 2019, sells products in 28 stores around the world.               Bouqdib says he fell in love with tea when he was a child, living next to the Chinese Embassy in Rabat, Morocco.               \"They always gave us, as the neighbor, some teas,\" Bouqdib said.               \"In Morocco, normally we have this tradition of drinking tea with mint and a lot of sugar,\" he added. For him, Chinese tea had a very \"unique\" and \"particular\" taste \u2014 one he'll never forget.               That experience led Bouqdib down the path to creating a beautiful place packed to the brim with teas.               From there, he expanded to coffee, with Bacha. He wanted to have \"coffee around the world in one place,\" where customers can \"discover other countries, other cultures, just in one store.\"               Bouqdib said that young people \u2014 even those without deep pockets \u2014 are good for TWG Tea and Bacha Coffee's business.               He said he wanted to price his products so that children or students with some spare pocket money could buy them as gifts or to pamper themselves.               If SG$12 strikes you as a lot for a cup of tea, remember that Singapore is a country where a flat white from Starbucks can easily cost you SG$9 \u2014 and that's for a takeaway order that doesn't include the sumptuous experience of a TWG.               And on the fancier end of the spectrum, if you were to opt for one of Singapore's premier high tea experiences, you could find yourself shelling out SG$98 for tea and finger foods at the Raffles Hotel's Grand Lobby.               Its prices are also on par with or lower than its competitors.A set of five macarons at TWG Tea's outlet in MBS retails for SG$12.50. For comparison, Angelina, another upscale caf in MBS located close to TWG, sells a set of four macaroons for SG$19.               Bacha, in particular, has been attracting a young clientele, Bouqdib said. This customer base is looking for premium products and is willing to spend \"a couple of dollars more\" on quality coffee, he added.               Keeping prices on the lower side has meant that TWG Tea and Bacha Coffee have been largely spared from the ongoing luxury slump, he said.               After the COVID-19 pandemic, the luxury industry took a hit when aspirational luxury shoppers scaled back on spending. In 2024, luxury spending stagnated, and big brands saw their share prices drop.               Bouqdib said luxury buyers feeling the pinch were less likely to spend thousands of dollars on expensive handbags and watches. But they still craved a luxe experience \u2014 which is where TWG Tea and Bacha Coffee are attempting to position their brands.               And Bouqdib says he thinks simplicity and authenticity are best, even in a market where there can be hundreds of permutations for coffee orders.               His stores \"don't have this big machine for espresso with the barista behind,\" he said. They prepare the coffee as in the old days, he said. In Bacha stores, the coffee is served in gold kettles.               \"I think the original always is the winner,\" Bouqdib said. \"To go back to the reality, to go back to how I can appreciate a nice cup of coffee.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Business Insider Edition  Bank overdraft fees appear to be back on the table following years of decline \u2014\u00a0and the largest banks stand to gain the most.            The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in December moved to limit the fees banks can charge customers whose accounts dip below their available balances. The CFPB's rule, set to go into effect later this year, would have capped overdraft fees to $5 at banks with at least $10 billion in assets.               On Friday, the US Senate voted down the rule, which the industry largely opposed. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on it next week.               \"We applaud today's Senate passage of the Congressional Review Act resolution nullifying the CFPB's unlawful overdraft rule,\" Rob Nichols, the president and CEO of the American Banking Association, said in a statement. \"Without access to overdraft protection, many Americans would be driven to less regulated and higher risk nonbank lenders to cover unexpected or emergency expenses.\"               Overdraft fees have been on the decline in recent years amid criticisms from the CFPB, which referred to them as \"junk fees.\"  Banks reported $1.36 billion in such fees for the first quarter of 2024 \u2014 down from $1.41 billion during the same period the year before and the lowest in three years, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.               In 2023, the last full year for which the data is available, consumers paid about $5.8 billion in fees for insufficient funds in their checking accounts, down from about $12 billion in 2019, according to the CFPB.               Not all banks charge overdraft fees \u2014 some firms like Charles Schwab and Capital One have ditched them altogether, according to NerdWallet. In recent years, Americans have been making using overdraft protection more infrequently, too.               Other firms have modified how and when they levy these fees. JPMorgan Chase and TD Bank may only charge an overdraft fee under certain circumstances, NerdWallet said, such as when an account is overdrawn by more than $50.               Limited information is available about what banks earned from overdraft fees in 2024. According to the CFPB, here's a look at what banks earned in 2023.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Stocks fell premarket after the Federal Reserve\u2019s favorite inflation measure came in slightly hotter than expected. Futures linked to the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all pointed to a lower open on Friday. General Motors (GM) and some other automaker shares extended declines overseas and premarket in the wake of Trump\u2019s imposition of 25% tariffs on all imported cars, trucks, and auto parts, announced Wednesday evening. The core PCE picked up to 0.37% month-on-month in February \u2014 faster than the expected 0.30% \u2014 from 0.30% in January. The year-over-year increase accelerated to 2.8% from an upwardly revised 2.7%. Monthly personal consumption grew a faster-than-projected 0.43% while income gains unexpectedly sped up to 0.80%. Economic indicators have been a mixed bag in recent weeks, with surveys showing both consumers and businesses feeling anxious about their future prospects, while actual data continues to point a strong labor market and ongoing growth \u2014 except for manufacturing. Stocks ended lower yesterday as investors\u2019 concerns about Trump\u2019s trade war outweighed a report showing new jobless claims held steady last week and an upward revision of fourth-quarter GDP. Here are some stocks to watch today: AppLovin (APP) stock jumped 9% in pre-opening trading, rebounding from Thursday\u2019s 20% decline prompted by the publication of a report by short seller Muddy Waters. General Motors fell 1.2% premarket, extending declines for a second day after President Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on all imported cars, trucks and auto parts. Stellantis (STLA) fell 1.6% before the bell, while Ford (F) edged higher.  Lululemon\u2019s (LULU) stock fell 11% premarket after the athleisure wear maker\u2019s projections for full-year sales and profit missed analyst expectations. The company has scrambled to update its product line to compete with trendier brands, Reuters (TRI) reported. Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) stock advanced 0.5% in early trading after analysts called Elon Musk\u2019s automaker the clear winner from Trump\u2019s tariffs given its more-localized production \u2014 and despite Musk\u2019s own assertion that the company won\u2019t be unscathed by the duties.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"ByGuruFocus  ByGuruFocus,  Contributor.  By Praveen Chawla OpenText Corporation, a Canada based enterprise information management software company, has faced significant challenges in recent years following a large acquisition. The stock has experienced a substantial decline, with a 41% drop over the past three years and a 33% decrease in the last year alone, currently trading at $26.09 per share. Despite this, it offers an attractive forward dividend yield of 4.05%, supported by an annual dividend payout ratio of $0.26. OpenText's valuation is notably low, with a forward price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 6.38, suggesting potential undervaluation compared to industry peers. The company's financials show revenue decline due to divestments, but strong adjusted EBITDA margins remain. OpenText is focusing on growth areas like cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI), with initiatives such as the Titanium X platform launch expected to drive AI-related revenue. However, high debt levels and slow organic growth posed challenges. The company has now addressed the debt issue through a divestiture and has made good progress in reducing debt. OpenText is a global leader in information management, operating in a $200 billion total addressable market. The company is active in six key markets: content management, IT operations management, application development and modernization, business network, cybersecurity, and AI analytics. OpenText is approaching $6 billion in revenue for fiscal 2026, with cloud bookings growth exceeding 15% annually and an adjusted EBITDA of 30%. Analysts anticipate earnings growth and increased free cash flow, but concerns about underperformance and investor confidence remain. Overall, OpenText presents a mixed picture for investors, balancing potential undervaluation and growth prospects against significant business challenges. Open Text Corp 12 Month Price Targets Chart OpenText offers a comprehensive suite of enterprise software products that span various aspects of information management and digital business processes. At the core of their offerings is the Enterprise Content Management (ECM) suite, which includes the Content Suite Platform, Extended ECM, and Documentum. For business-to-business integration, OpenText provides the Trading Grid as part of its Business Network solutions. The company also offers Customer Experience Management tools and Digital Process Automation solutions like AppWorks. In the realm of legal technology, OpenText's Discovery suite, featuring Axcelerate, supports eDiscovery and investigations. The company has significantly bolstered its security offerings with products such as EnCase Forensic Security Suite, Carbonite, Webroot, NetIQ, ArcSight, Voltage, and Fortify. For organizations looking to leverage artificial intelligence and analytics, OpenText provides the Magellan Product Suite. Additional key products include information management tools like Archive Center and RightFax, as well as web content management solutions. This diverse product portfolio positions OpenText as a one-stop shop for enterprises seeking comprehensive information management and digital transformation solutions. Over its history OpenText has been an highly acquisitive company to build out its software stack. The acquisitions started in 2003 with IXOS Software AG; some recent acquisitions included Micro Focus in 2023 and Application Modernization and Connectivity (AMC) business in 2024. These acquisitions highlight OpenText's significant acquisitions and a recent major divestment, showcasing the company's strategic evolution in the enterprise information management space. It also demonstrates the company's considerable experience in integrating acqusitions. OpenText's $5.8 billion acquisition of UK based MicroFocus in 2023 was driven by a multifaceted strategy aimed at significantly expanding its market presence and enhancing its product portfolio. This move expanded OpenText's total addressable market (TAM) to $170 billion and added approximately $2.7 billion in annual revenue, making it one of the world's largest software and cloud businesses. The acquisition brought valuable software solutions in areas such as identity access, security, IT operations management, and networking, complementing OpenText's existing offerings and accelerating its digital transformation capabilities through enhanced cloud and AI technologies. OpenText also \/gained access to MicroFocus's prestigious customer base, strengthening its global reach and cybersecurity offerings. The company projected annual cost savings of $400 million through operational synergies and expected the acquisition to immediately boost its adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Ultimately, this strategic move positioned OpenText as a more comprehensive and competitive player in the information management and enterprise software space, while achieving significant operational and financial synergies. Company Strategy The company's future business strategy focuses more on organic growth, primarily driven by cloud services. Cloud revenue is projected to comprise 40% of total revenue, with customer support at 40% and license\/professional services at 20%. OpenText continues to offer on-premises options for customers while investing heavily in cloud development. This dual approach allows the company to cater to a wide range of customer needs. Open Text Operating Revenue by Business Segment In early 2023, OpenText acquired Micro Focus for approximately $6 billion. As part of its strategic realignment, the company has divested the Mainframe, Application Modernization and Connectivity (AMC) business for $2.275 billion. Following this divestiture, OpenText will retain IT operations management, application development and modernization, cybersecurity, and AI analytics from Micro Focus. This strategic move is designed to optimize OpenText's portfolio and focus on high-growth areas. Artificial intelligence (AI) is seen as a significant growth opportunity for OpenText, driving cloud bookings growth. The company has launched an AI product called Aviator, which is available across all business pillars. OpenText is leveraging its large installed base and existing customer relationships to drive AI adoption, positioning itself for further expansion in this area. Financially, OpenText plans to use the proceeds from the AMC divestiture to reduce debt, aiming to bring its net leverage ratio below 3x. Once leverage covenants allow, the company intends to implement a share buyback program. OpenText has increased its annual cloud bookings growth guidance to 25-30% and expects 7-9% revenue growth in fiscal 2026. This strategic financial management is designed to enhance shareholder value while supporting ongoing business growth. The near term Revenue and Operating Income trend appears to be encouraging, with double digit % growth over the last 3 years, and it appears that the company is coming out of a funk following a period of major acquisitions and divestment. Open Text Price Revenue and Operating Income Chart Guru Holdings of OpenText Ray Dalio\u2019s Bridgewater, Brandes Investment, Grantham, Greenblatt and Royce have holdings in Open Text. Most of the gurus are value investors while Ray Dalio (Trades, Portfolio) is more of a \"macro\" investor. Open Text Guru Trades Chart Jarislowsky, Fraser Ltd (JFL Global) is one of the largest institutional shareholders of OpenText Corporation. They own about 7.14% of the outstanding shares. JFL Global which is based in Montreal is a long term investor and emphasizes quality business's with sustainable competitive advantage. Mackenzie Financial Corporation a Toronto based deep value investor holds 2.07% of the outstanding stock. Conclusion OpenText is still in a period of transition after its transformative acquisition of Microfocus and divestment of AMC. It's basically now transitioning from being an acquirer towards an emphasis on organic growth focused on cloud and Software as a Service (Saas). OpenText's has a large TAM to aim for and a long runway for growth. It also has a very large and sticky legacy business which brings in reliable cash flows from lucrative and renewing customer support services. The company's FCF yield is nearly 10%. Open Text Cash and Debt Chart Given the deleveraging following the AMC divestment the company's balance sheet is now in better shape (with debt\/equity of 1.58) and the company is poised to return cash to the company via stock buybacks. I expect the stock should offer steady growth in the years ahead. OpenText is a rare undervalued stock and an established dividend payer, a rarity in the software industry.","label":1}

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Watch CBS News  Updated on:  March 28, 2025 \/ 3:09 PM EDT           \/ CBS News          Stocks are taking a battering on Friday amid growing concerns on Wall Street about the impact of President Trump's tariff regime as well as hotter-than-expected price data, sparking worries that the Federal Reserve is far from declaring victory on inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 758 points, or 1.8%, to 41,541.09 in Friday afternoon trading, while the broad-based S&P 500 shed 2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index skidded 2.8%.\u00a0 Friday's stock market rout comes after Wall Street has already suffered a pummeling this year, with the S&P 500 down 9% from its most recent February high.\u00a0 Mr. Trump on Wednesday said he is imposing a\u00a025% tariff on all vehicles\u00a0and auto parts imported into the U.S., a move that is expected to add thousands of dollars to the cost of many vehicles. He also plans to announce more tariffs on April 2. Because tariffs are import taxes that companies largely pass onto consumers, many economists are forecasting an uptick in inflation later this year. At the same time, new economic data released on Friday shows that core inflation heated up last month, posing a challenge to the Federal Reserve's goal of driving inflation down to a 2% annual rate. \"The recent U.S. stock market correction appears to have been partially triggered by investors realising that Trump may follow through with his tariff threats and that this will hurt the U.S. economy,\" said Oxford Economics lead economist Daniel Harenberg and senior economist Kiki Sondh in a Friday report. \"Similarly, consumer sentiment has weakened due to tariff-induced inflation fears.\" The economy has so far been holding up relatively well, but if it were to weaken while inflation stays high, it would produce a worst-case scenario called \"stagflation,\" which policymakers in Washington have few good tools to fix. A report on Friday morning showed that U.S. consumers, including Republicans, Independents and Democrats, getting more pessimistic about their future finances. Two out of three consumers surveyed by the University of Michigan expect unemployment to worsen in the year ahead. That's the the highest reading since 2009, and it raises worries about a job market that's been the linchpin keeping the U.S. economy solid. At the same time, recent CBS News polling shows that Americans have become more dour in their economic outlooks, with relatively more consumers bracing for a slowdown or\u00a0recession\u00a0over the next year. Shares of automakers tumbled on Friday, continuing a rout that began after Mr. Trump announced his new auto tariffs.\u00a0Hyundai Motor fell 2.6% in Seoul, while Honda Motor fell 2.6%, and Toyota Motor sank 2.8% in Tokyo. On Wall Street, Ford Motor fell 2.6%, and General Motors sank 1.7%. Even U.S. automakers selling vehicles in the country can feel the pain of such tariffs because their supply chains are spread throughout North America. Trump says he wants more manufacturing to take place within the United States. The rout also hit shares outside the auto industry, with investors concerned that Mr. Trump's trade war may cause U.S. households and businesses to freeze their spending. Even if the tariffs end up being less painful than feared, all the uncertainty may filter into changed behaviors that hurt the economy. Leading the market lower on Friday was Lululemon Athletica, which dropped 15%. Even though the seller of athletic apparel reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, it warned that its revenue growth may slow this upcoming year as consumers grow more cautious. \"Consumers are spending less due to increased concerns about inflation and the economy,\" said CEO Calvin McDonald. Lululemon also said tariffs and shifting foreign-currency values may account for about half of its expected drop in a key measure of performance: how much profit it can squeeze out of each $1 of revenue. Oxford Industries, the company behind the Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands, likewise reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected but still saw its stock fall 3.1%. CEO Tom Chubb said it saw a \"deterioration in consumer sentiment that also weighed on demand\" beginning in January, which accelerated into February.   The Associated Press                            contributed to this report.         Aimee Picchi is the associate managing editor for CBS MoneyWatch, where she covers business and personal finance.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Following Amazon's indictment of the Surface line, it has now set its sights on Xbox.   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Microsoft is a center for hardware excellence, at least generally speaking. Known for software primarily, Microsoft has been able to deliver surprisingly high-quality hardware products too in recent years. The Surface line has been particularly influential on the laptop market, which counts even Apple among companies stealing its ideas. The Xbox Series X was the most powerful, quietest, and coolest video game console until Sony's mid-gen PS5 Pro refresh came along. And the Xbox Series S defies expectations with its neat and small size. However, even a near-perfect product can be undermined by a single, significant defect. RELATED: How to fix the Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 bumpers by yourself You may recall the Xbox 360's notorious red ring of death issue, which cost Microsoft billions of dollars to rectify. The Xbox Series X|S platform has been the most reliable console I've ever owned as a result of those \"learnings,\" but the same sadly cannot be said for one of its other flagship Xbox products, and now Amazon is warning users against buying it. Recently, Amazon updated its store pages to warn users when a product suffered from heavy returns. Indeed, we reported recently that ARM-based Surface devices have fallen under Amazon's scrutiny, with store listings appearing with a big \"frequently returned item\" warning. While browsing Amazon for a replacement Xbox Elite Controller Series 2, I discovered that it too has earned a similar warning.  As of writing, I am frustratingly on my not second, but third Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 unit. The first was a review unit, which I loved \u2014 until the stick drift became unbearable around 6-8 months in. The second I purchased myself, until the right bumper became unusable, only registering actuations around half of the time. Again, after around 6-8 months. The third I have here has now also fallen victim to the same bumper issue, which I suspect may be particularly prevalent among soulsborne players, where attacks are mapped to the bumpers rather than face buttons. Whatever the cause, I feel like a controller that RRPs for almost $200 shouldn't break down after a few months of regular use. And now, Amazon's store page for the Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 warns users to check reviews before buying. As it should! There are ways to fix this issue and save yourself some bucks, and I'll be writing a guide on it soon, but for the vast majority of people, returning it with the standard 1 year warranty might be a better option. I would urge that instead, you buy something like the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro (Amazon) on the high end, or the GameSir G7 (Amazon) on the more affordable end. Both of these controllers feel just as good as a standard Xbox Elite controller, without the wear and tear problems. There's also the standard Xbox controller (Amazon) of course, which actually reads \"frequently kept,\" showing a low return-rate. And here's another Xbox product with a \"usually keep this item\" satisfaction rate!  Surprisingly, the Xbox Series S, which is often derided by content creators and commentators, enjoys a high satisfaction rate according to Amazon. \"Users usually keep this item,\" the green label reads, suggesting that buyers typically are satisfied with their purchases. I couldn't check the Xbox Series X satisfaction labels because it's, uh, out of stock (again) as of writing. The Xbox Series S is often blamed for some of Xbox's content gap problems, with titles like Black Myth Wukong skipping the platform entirely rather than having to make the effort to optimize their game for the Xbox Series S. For some reason, the Steam Deck avoids these criticisms despite its similar performance caps, but hey, it's not like there's a tax on Xbox discourse or anything (joke, joke). Seriously, though, the Xbox Series S is a tidy little system if you're looking to make a big saving on current gen gaming. If all you want to do is slam Fortnite or Call of Duty in your living room at 1080p, there's probably no more cost-effective way to do it right now. It's good that Amazon has started calling out companies and products that aren't making the grade, though, while celebrating those that do. Microsoft's Snapdragon-powered Copilot+ PC range is receiving a ton of criticism on Amazon for compatibility issues, rightfully so, as many of the promises Microsoft made about usability simply haven't panned out. The Xbox Elite Controller Series 2 quality control problems are also well documented, and I hope Microsoft pours some of these learnings into the inevitable Xbox Elite Controller Series 3 (which, by the way, we have some tentative confirmation on existing \u2014 full report coming soon.)  If you're in the market for a new controller, do consider the Razer and GameSir alternatives I mentioned. At least we have a lot of options to choose from these days.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"ByMoneyShow  ByMoneyShow,  Contributor.  It\u2019s a tough market, one where 25% auto tariffs are just the latest challenge for the bulls. But metals and miners are a \u201csilver\u201d lining for investors. Read about why stocks are weak, but metals are strong \u2013 and what to DO about it as an investor. Peter Krauth Stock Investor I\u2019m back behind my desk after participating in the Swiss Mining Institute\u2019s March Conference. While gold may be at the start of a mild near-term correction after becoming overbought, silver is looking less overbought and may hold up. We enjoyed the inevitable fondue dinner that facilitated lots of great networking, then spent the next two days in meetings with companies of all stripes. The mood was unsurprisingly upbeat with gold near record highs above $3,035 and silver flirting with $34. On the macro side, there was considerable talk of tariffs and a coming global reordering and how that is extremely bullish for precious metals. On the mining side, many experts suggested that merger and acquisition activity should pick up, and that near-term developers could be the most likely targets. Focusing on silver, the physical market remains abnormally tight with lease rates many times their normal levels. Flows from London to the New York Comex exchange have been steady, with some 134Moz flowing West in the four months to the end of February. LBMA The flow of metal from London to New York explains some of the jump in lease rates. Still, it\u2019s intriguing that gold lease rates have eased while silver rates have remained elevated. Nicholas Vardy The Global Guru Most investors chase AI, semiconductors, and the latest crypto buzz. But one of the most explosive trades of the year is hiding in plain sight. That trade? Copper. The red metal is quietly approaching a new all-time high. Commodities giants like Mercuria and Trafigura predict copper will surge past $12,000 per ton. That's well above the $11,000 highs we had seen in 2024. But this isn\u2019t another hype-fueled moonshot. It\u2019s not driven by Reddit threads or TikTok influencers. Copper\u2019s story is rooted in macro fundamentals. And the world is only just beginning to notice. If you\u2019re a contrarian investor looking for the next asymmetric bet, copper may be your best bet. United States Copper Index Fund (CPER) Copper isn\u2019t just an industrial metal. It\u2019s the wiring of the global energy transition. Electric Vehicles (EVs) demand four times the copper of their internal combustion cousins. Solar farms, wind turbines, and battery storage all run on copper. Even the AI-driven data centers capturing Wall Street's fancy rely heavily on it. And while demand soars, supply is stagnant. Bringing a new copper mine online takes 10 to 15 years. Regulations and rising geopolitical tensions in Chile and Peru only add more friction. The result? A textbook imbalance. Demand rising. Supply stagnating. And prices are starting to reflect the pressure. The US is also reportedly considering tariffs on imported copper just as it did with steel and aluminum. Traders are already front-running the move. Reports suggest over 400,000 tonnes of copper are headed to the US as buyers rush to beat potential tariffs. If tariffs happen, US copper markets could tighten sharply. Domestic producers stand to benefit. Prices could spike. And we\u2019ll have yet another politically driven catalyst on our hands. Here are some ways to play it: 1. Copper ETFs 2. Major Miners 3. Junior Miners 4. Options Strategies 5. Copper Futures (for advanced traders) Size your positions accordingly. Mike Larson MoneyShow.com You know I\u2019m a big fan of precious metals like gold and silver. But what other metals and commodities are worth a look? Today\u2019s MoneyShow Chart of the Day sheds some light on the subject. It shows the year-to-date performance of the VanEck Rare Earth and Strategic Metals ETF (REMX) and the Global X Copper Miners ETF (COPX), and how their returns compare to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY). You can see that these mining ETFs are handily outperforming the S&P \u2013 up about 9% in both cases versus a drop of almost 4%. REMX, COPX, SPY (YTD % Change)  REMX owns companies that produce, refine, and recycle metals and materials like lithium, lanthanum, and titanium. Holdings include Albermarle Corp. (ALB) and Sigma Lithium Corp. (SGML). COPX owns \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 copper-mining companies. Top positions include Southern Copper Corp. (SCCO), Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (FCX), and Ero Copper Corp. (ERO). What\u2019s the bull case for NON-precious metals and the companies that mine them? First, President Trump just signed an executive order designed to boost domestic production of strategic and rare earth materials and elements. That could make it easier for miners to plan, fund, and build out projects here at home. Second, copper prices have rallied in 2025 amid hopes for demand-boosting stimulus in China, plus reports of dwindling mine supply. So, if you\u2019re looking for OTHER metals and materials plays outside of gold and silver...maybe give these a look in 2025.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"It comes with interchangeable accessories, a built-in mirror, and swappable backs!  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.   Join Namerah Saud Fatmi as she explores the cool, quirky, and sometimes downright odd world of smartphone accessories, gadgets, and other nerdy toys every week. I thought I could use a dumbphone for 24 hours as a working adult, but it turns out that's impossible in the modern era. However, I found that the vibrant HMD Barbie Phone is suitable for young children and pre-teen kids. The Barbie Phone is basically a revamped version of the Nokia 2780 Flip, which is the best dumbphone on the market. Both devices are powered by KaiOS instead of Android, lack touchscreens, and have other limitations that categorize them as \"dumb\" phones. This isn't all bad, and you still get the basic functions of a mobile phone along with some perks. The software limitations serve as excellent parental controls while still enabling communication between guardians and their wards. Since KaiOS is much lighter than Android, it doesn't need a ton of memory to run smoothly. This means that even with 512MB of RAM and 4GB of internal storage, the Barbie Phone doesn't lag or stutter. You can always expand the memory up to 32GB via microSD later if needed. Children adore bright colors, so it's a given that the littles will love this overwhelmingly pink phone. HMD Global partnered with Mattel to deliver the funkiest, grooviest, and most fun packaging I've seen for a phone. The HMD Barbie Phone comes inside a pale pink velvet-lined box with a plethora of accessories. Your kid can knock themselves out customizing their Barbie phone. There are stickers in the box, replaceable backs for the phone, a beaded lanyard, a handful of cutesy charms, and gems to bedazzle the device as well. The wide range of accessories included in the set encourages children to express their individuality. HMD Global includes a bubblegum pink USB-C charger and cable in the box, as well as a pink microfiber cloth for wiping the mirror on the front. That's right, the front of the flip phone has a real mirror with a tiny LED screen built-in. The screen showcases the time, charging information, and notifications. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android While the Nokia 2780 Flip has the Kai Store with HTML5 apps like Facebook and YouTube, HMD Global intentionally omitted social media from the Barbie Phone, with the exception of an email app. The reason for this, according to HMD Global, is to keep the device non-intrusive by removing distracting apps. You only get basics like calls and text messages, Wi-Fi, and LTE connectivity on the device, which is why I feel it's an excellent phone for younger kids. Pre-teens whose parents feel they aren't ready for social media and instant connection with the world still need to be on the grid. The Barbie Phone enables that in a safe and seamless method. It's an excellent \"first\" phone for a child, preparing them for the responsibility of having a full-blown phone as well. It's not a boring phone either, with plenty of engaging games, an FM radio, and a music player. There are useful pre-loaded apps like a clock, calendar, to-do list, and voice recorder. There's even a flashlight, a headphone jack, and a single 5MP camera that shoots amicable pictures. There's a customizable Barbie button on the keypad, which opens the camera app initially. Typing on the old school keypad takes some getting used to, especially for younger generations who never had to use such phones ever before. The pink plastic buttons are easy to click and you get the hang of it pretty quickly. I'm glad that this concept lives on in dumbphones, reviving and sustaining the nostalgia of the physical numpad. HMD Global offers an insanely good price for the Barbie Phone. You can buy it unlocked for about $129.99, often discounted to $99.99 at various retailers like Amazon and Best Buy. Buying it locked is a smart idea too, as the cell plan from most carriers is filthy cheap. The HMD Barbie Phone works on all U.S. networks, CDMA and GSM alike. Certain MVNOs like Consumer Cellular offer a great deal with plans starting at just $20 a month, which is super affordable. Giving a full-blown smartphone to kids isn't a smart idea for countless reasons. More often than not, the cons far outweigh the pros, leaving parents to turn to alternatives like kids' smartwatches and dumbphones instead. Few phones are built from the ground up with children in mind. Most brands take pre-existing models and tweak them to make them suitable for kids or teenagers by bolstering privacy and security, and adding stricter parental controls. A lot of thought goes into choosing a phone for a child. If you're not keen on buying your 10 to 14-year-old an Android phone or an iPhone, the dumb HMD Barbie Phone is a fantastic choice. It maintains the right balance of connectivity, modernization, and limitation necessary for a younger child without taking the fun out of owning a phone.   It's fantastic, mostly plastic The HMD Barbie Phone is a modified Nokia 2780 Flip with loads of fun accessories in the box. It's an affordable entry-level dumb phone suitable to be any child's first phone. Namerah enjoys geeking out over accessories, gadgets, and all sorts of smart tech.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Let's not panic...  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  While Intel's Battlemage Arc B580 and B570 GPUs have provided great and affordable mid-range options for PC gamers, Team Blue is yet to make a high-end GPU to compete with Nvidia (since AMD is also focusing primarily on the mid-range space going forward). Unfortunately, it now looks like the wait will continue. According to a reputable leaker, Jaykihn0 on X, Intel's supposed high-end Battlemage GPU plans were cut short in Q3 of 2024: in other words, Xe2-based GPUs reportedly featuring up to 24GB of VRAM have been canceled. The 'BMG-G31' die supposedly had a 256-bit memory bus with 32 Xe cores and at least 16GB of GDDR6 VRAM. Any hopes of a strong high-end alternative to Nvidia's RTX GPUs are seemingly slimmer than ever, as both AMD and Intel continue to target affordable options for consumers. While Jaykihn0 suggests there are currently no updates on the upcoming Celestial discrete GPU lineup, it's certainly not over for Intel potentially delving into the high-end market. Celestial GPUs are rumored to use Xe3P architecture, which could involve some high-end GPUs and improved features like XeSS Frame Generation - however, it's not yet clear when they will be ready for consumers. In the meantime, Intel's Xe3 architecture will be used for the upcoming Panther Lake processors, likely including mobile processors for ultrabooks and handhelds. There's plenty to look forward to on Team Blue's end, especially after the success of its current Battlemage GPUs, and processors like the Core Ultra 7 258V.  If it wasn't clear enough already, the GPU market is in dire need of a helping hand: scalping, price inflation, and low availability are at an all-time high, and the only way I can see this changing is if consumers don't acquiesce to purchasing overpriced GPUs. However, most importantly, we need more high-end GPUs that aren't from Nvidia. Team Green's Blackwell GPU lineup is the only product range that includes true high-end options this generation, and it's not a surprise that there's hardly any stock for Founders Edition cards, considering their popularity and demand. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. While AMD's mid-range Radeon RX 9070 XT comes at an incredible $599\/\u00a3569, there are no reference cards, which means consumers must rely on AIB partner cards sold by retailers - which are currently charging over $200 more than MSRP. Don't believe me? Just have a look at Best Buy. With this in mind, Intel is potentially the only one in the market that could offer high-end alternatives in the near future: I'll admit it's hard to suggest any of these GPUs would beat Nvidia's RTX 5090, but PC gamers need all the industry competition we can get.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"ByMauricio Di Bartolomeo  ByMauricio Di Bartolomeo,  Contributor.  CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - MARCH 16: A GameStop store operates in a strip mall on March 16, 2023 in ... More Chicago, Illinois. The gaming retailer, which is scheduled to report earnings on March 21, saw its stock price jump more than five percent today.  (Photo by Scott Olson\/Getty Images) GameStop is back in the headlines, and this time it has nothing to do with Roaring Kitty. During its Q1 2025 earnings report this Tuesday, GameStop reported that its board had approved the addition of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. This means the company is now authorized to invest a portion of its cash or future debt and equity issuances in Bitcoin. According to its most recent 10K filing, the company is currently sitting on more than $4.7 Billion worth of cash and cash equivalents. Which is a massive pile relative to the size of its operations. The company made $120 Million in operating income last year. The source of the current cash position was a series of timely equity offerings during one of the stock\u2019s volatility episodes. During 2024 short squeeze dynamics drove the price much higher, which allowed the company to issue shares, diluting common shareholders by approximately 15% and raising the company over $3.4 Billion in cash. In other words, the company sold shares at a valuation of approximately ~$22.5 Billion, and it\u2019s currently trading at ~$10 Billion. It was an opportunistic move to capitalize on a high share price and has played out very well for the company\u2019s cash position. In addition to the $4.7 Billion in cash and cash equivalents, the company has also announced it will be issuing a 0% convertible note for $1.3 Billion, with potential to expand the offering to $1.5 Billion. The sale of the $1.3 Billion convertible note is expected to be completed by April 1st, 2025, and participants will have 13 days to exercise their option to invest up to $200 Million more. The company expects to have net proceeds of $1.28 billion ,or approximately $1.48 billion if the options for further investment are fully exercised. The notes have a 5-year term, maturing on April 1st, 2030. The conversion price for the notes is equivalent to $29.85 per share, which represents a 35% increase from today\u2019s closing price of $22.09. This means that for every $100,000 invested in the note, an investor could get 3,350 shares of GameStop if the shares reach the conversion price or go above it. If it doesn\u2019t, the note investors are first in line to get repaid in full. Thus, the attractiveness of this note lies in the option to convert the principal into shares if things go well for the company. To give you a sense of the implied yield that the convertible notes are getting by way of the option to convert into shares, a call option to purchase a share of GameStop at $30 on January 15th, 2027 trades for $8.08. This means that for every $100,000 invested, which would result in 3,350 shares, an investor would be getting well over $27,000 in \u201coption value\u201d (3,350 * $8.08). Keep in mind that the same option going out until April 30th 2030 instead of January 15th 2027 would be much more valuable due to having a longer duration. So it\u2019s safe to assume that note investors are getting an implied total yield of well over >30% on their investment, or an equivalent of well over >6% annualized, if we quantify the value of their option to convert. Given the company\u2019s new investment and treasury policy, it shouldn\u2019t be long until we hear about their first Bitcoin allocation or purchase. With this note issuance GameStop now officially joins the ranks of Strategy, Metaplanet, and Samara Asset Group as the 4th publicly listed company to issue debt to purchase bitcoin.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Business Insider Edition  Women entrepreneurs are outpacing men, according to Wells Fargo's latest report on the impact of women-owned businesses.          Although corporate America is still predominantly led by men, the number of women-owned businesses has grown faster than those owned by men in the past five years. Small businesses helmed by women have also seen faster employment and revenue growth over that period, based on Wells Fargo's analysis of Census data.               \"Women see a real opportunity in entrepreneurship to do things on their own,\" said Geri Stengel, the president of Ventureneer, a market research firm that co-published the report with Wells Fargo. \"They've hit the wall in corporate America.\"               While there are still significant barriers for women raising the capital needed to start a business, the report notes that solopreneurs have risen with the advent of digital platforms that democratize business opportunities. Women, in particular, have continued to flourish after federal stimulus packages aimed at supporting small businesses during the pandemic.               Education is a factor as well, Stengel added. Currently women are attending and graduating from college at higher rates than men.               Despite the strong recent growth in women's entrepreneurship, they're still underrepresented at the top of the corporate ladder. Women-owned companies only make up 2.4% of businesses that earn more than $20 million a year in revenue compared to men-owned businesses that make up 22.5%, according to the Wells Fargo study. The remaining balance represents companies owned by multiple people, or large corporations.               Overall the gender gap between the revenue earned by all women-owned businesses is gradually closing and if the current trend continues, the study projects that it would take 120 years before women would reach equal parity with men.               The study goes on to highlight that Black women-owned employer firms have experienced a growth rate three times all women-owned businesses \u2014 in part supported by diversity programs and movements like Buy Black, according to their findings.               \"There was a concerted effort to support Black\/African American businesses and communities after the killing of George Floyd,\" read the report's key statistics on Black women. In 2020, activists affiliated with the Black Lives Matter movement called on consumers to close the revenue gap for Black entrepreneurs by spending their dollars at Black-owned businesses. \"The growth of Black\/African American women-owned employers surged between 2019 and 2024, at 51.2%, compared to all women, at 17.2%.\"               But the report also noted that the growth for Black and Latino employers has cooled, with more recent political changes potentially adding to that slowdown.               \"That wave has diminished to a large extent,\" Stengel said of the support for Black-owned businesses that exploded during the pandemic. \"And we're not going to really see it right now because of the DEI executive orders.\"               Trump's administration has called diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, prioritizing opportunities for underrepresented groups, \"radical and wasteful.\" Businesses like Target and Amazon have also pulled back on DEI initiatives since the presidential election.               This month, the US Small Business Administration announced agency-wide job cuts and priority shifts under the Trump administration.               \"The agency has veered off track \u2014 doubling in size and turning into a sprawling leviathan plagued by mission creep, financial mismanagement, and waste,\" said SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler in a press release. Several grants are being terminated including the Community Navigator Pilot Program that awarded funding to small businesses in underserved areas.               \"Just like the small business owners we support, we must do more with less,\" Loeffler continued.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Business Insider Edition  A federal jury in Manhattan has convicted the Frank founder, Charlie Javice, of four counts of\u00a0defrauding JPMorgan Chase.          It took jurors eight hours of deliberations over two days to reach Friday's verdict. Over six weeks of testimony, prosecutors proved Javice used fake data to trick the largest US bank into buying her startup for $175 million.               She was convicted of conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud, and bank, wire, and securities fraud. The maximum sentence for the charges is 30 years in prison. Javice's sentencing was set for 11 a.m. on July 26.               Javice, 32, showed no expression as the verdict was read. Several family members sitting behind Javice held each other and audibly sobbed.               Juror number four, a woman who sat in the front row of the jury box, was also visibly moved.               Throughout the trial, this juror frequently smiled at Javice while walking past her as the jury entered and left the courtroom. On Friday, as the jury was individually polled, she held her hand to her mouth, appearing stricken by the decision and on the brink of tears.               The five-woman, seven-man jury also found Javice's former top lieutenant, 50-year-old Olivier Amar, guilty of the same four fraud counts as Javice.               \"You came to a verdict that was reasonable,\" US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein said in thanking the jury for their service.               As the jury filed out of the courtroom for the final time and the spectators rose from their seats, three people in the \"defendant family\" row of the audience remained seated.               The defendants are due back in court Tuesday when their lawyers will argue against prosecutors' request that Javice and Amar wear GPS ankle bracelets until sentencing. A lawyer for Javice told the judge that an ankle bracelet would be \"impossible\" given her work as a Pilates teacher.               The verdict is the latest chapter in a spectacular fall from grace for the once promising microfinance entrepreneur.               Javice was 27 years old in summer 2021, when JPMorgan executives agreed to acquire her website.               She was at the height of her success. She'd been named to Forbes' \"30 Under 30\" list in 2019 and had attracted tens of millions of dollars in private equity funding.               Aleph's Michael Eisenberg and Apollo's Marc Rowan were early investors and board members. During negotiations, she met one-on-one for 30 minutes with the bank's CEO, Jamie Dimon.               \"They saw something in Charlie, a young female CEO breaking the glass ceiling,\" her lead attorney, Jose Baez, told jurors in opening statements.               The bank's main goal in acquiring Frank, the defense lawyer argued, was to hire this rising fintech star as managing director in charge of student solutions \u2014 and to keep her and the website out of the hands of the competition.               \"That's what JPMorgan negotiated for,\" Baez told jurors. \"And that's what they got.\"               Prosecutors countered that the only real draw was Javice's data.               Frank gave students a simplified platform for filling out their FAFSA forms \u2014 the Free Application for Federal Student Aid \u2014 making it a treasure trove of student data and of great interest to banks.               Visitors would create an account and begin entering their financial and identifying information. The Frank site boasted that it used these inputs to generate a completed FAFSA in seven minutes, far more quickly than the average 13 hours the forms otherwise took to complete.               According to trial testimony, by the time the Frank-JPMorgan merger closed after months of negotiations, just under 300,000 visitors had signed up for a Frank account and shared their first name, last name, email address, and phone number.               Prosecutors said Javice fraudulently enticed JPMorgan to pay $175 million for the website by wildly inflating that 300,000 figure.               A federal prosecutor told jurors in closing arguments that Javice and Amar consistently assured JPMorgan \"that Frank had over 4 million users and that a user was someone who'd started an account by providing their first name, last name, phone number, and email.\"               \"Charlie Javice and Olivier Amar sold Frank for $175 million worth of lies,\" the prosecutor, Nicholas Chiuchiolo, told them on Wednesday.               \"Frank's 4 million customers \u2014 they were made up,\" Chiuchiolo said. \"Literally made up by a computer program. They did not exist. And through their lies Ms. Javice and Mr. Amar became multimillionaires.\"               The bank purchased Frank in order to market financial products \u2014 Chase checking accounts, credit cards, auto loans, and the like \u2014 directly to these 4 million students.               Lawyers for Javice and Amar countered that they'd made it clear to the bank that when they referred to their 4 million users, they meant the number of people who visited the website.               They also argued that the distinction didn't actually matter. The bank never cared how many visitors or student emails Frank had, the defense argued. It cared so little, in fact, that during months of negotiations \u2014 as all sides in the case agree \u2014 its executives never bothered to verify if Frank's 4 million users existed.               Multiple government witnesses, including Chase's CFO at the time, Sarah Youngwood, who's now the CFO of Nasdaq, told jurors a different story.               They testified that what JPMorgan really wanted was the millions of rows of student contact information, which the bank could use to pitch Chase accounts to young people at the start of their financial journeys.               Leslie Wims Morris, JPMorgan's corporate development head who led the bank's Frank acquisition team, told jurors that the bank relied on trust, not verification.               She also told jurors there's no way JPMorgan would have even looked at Frank if the bank knew that Javice only had the names and personal identifying information for fewer than 300,000 students.               Baez mocked Wims Morris in Wednesday's closings, noting that since the deal with Frank went south, she's now the CEO of Chase Auto.               \"I think her biggest client is Frank's Auto Lot,\" Javice's lawyer joked to jurors.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Business Insider Edition  Hey brands, want to sponsor my daughter's 16th birthday?          That was the pitch YouTuber Jordan Matter threw out to a room full of marketers on Thursday during creator startup Spotter's first upfront-style event. The showcase was an opportunity for YouTubers like Matter, Dude Perfect, Ryan Trahan, and MrBeast to lay out their content slate for the coming year. The goal? Woo brands into buying ads on their videos.               For Matter, who posts content with his family, the big upcoming tentpole event was his daughter Salish's 16th birthday. \"Anybody represent any automobile manufacturers here?\" he asked the crowd.               He pointed outthat Salish's birthday falls in the fourth quarter, a time when brands are shelling out their biggest ad budgets. \"Lucky us,\" Matter said.               The creator-run presentations mirrored the annual upfront pitches from TV broadcasters or NewFront sessions hosted by digital platforms like Snapchat and TikTok. But several of the creators who took the stage at Spotter's event were pitching something slightly different: their obsessively loyal, parasocial audiences. (Parasocial relationships are when fans imagine they have a friendship with a celebrity they don't personally know.)               \"An influencer invites you into their home every week, and you feel like you're a part of their family,\" Matter told the crowd. \"They have such a deep connection with their audience that transcends, I think, kind of anything you can find elsewhere.\"               Once you have that level of fan loyalty, you can sell almost anything. Perhaps, that makes your content a better place to put ads than a traditional TV or streaming show. That's at least what Spotter hoped the marketers would take away from the event.               \"Let's be clear, creators are the networks of today,\" Spotter's president Nic Paul told the crowd. \"They are delivering the hit shows that are attracting audience attention at scale.\"       YouTube was the biggest platform for US TV viewing in February, ahead of companies like Netflix, Disney, and Fox, per Nielsen's \"Media Distributor Gauge,\" which looks at viewership across cable, streaming, and other distributors.               Some of the Spotter creators' shows could comfortably live on traditional television. During the presentations, YouTuber Airrack announced plans to climb Mount Everest for a coming video project. Creators Sam and Colbyare planning to drop a new paranormal video series. Creator Kinigra Deon said she's putting together a movie in collaboration with Kevin Hart's entertainment company. And Melissa Drucker, MrBeast's global brand partnerships lead, took the stage to talk about the return of his Amazon series, \"Beast Games.\"               But others, like Matter, pitched content that veered deeper into their personal lives.               YouTuber Rebecca Zamolo, who has over 18 million subscribers on her main YouTube channel, was looking for brand partners for a back-to-school-themed video series that would overlap with the birth of her second child, for example.               \"Baby No. 2 will also be arriving when back to school hits, so, even more of a reason for our audience to be excited and to increase engagement even more,\" she said.               Zamolo said she earlier used a blue can of Poppi in a sponsored video to reveal the gender of her next child to her daughter.               Sponsoring a video about a birthday,\u00a0wedding proposal, or childbirth is certainly not new in the influencer business.               But there was something a little jarring about hearing a father court brands for \"integrations\" tied to his teenager's birthday.               That said, he makes a fair point that Salish's deeply loyal follower base, combined with YouTube's growing market share among TV viewers, positions her and the rest of the creator cohort very well to sell stuff.               For example, MrBeast makes more money from selling his Feastables chocolates than he does from his videos, Bloomberg reported, citing company documents sent to investors.               Trahan made a similar point when he talked about converting his 19.4 million subscribers into strong evangelists for his candy brand, Joyride.               \"My audience is on a mission to make it a top-selling candy in Target,\" Trahan told the Spotter crowd. \"This is such a great example of what can happen whenever you give the creators an opportunity to tell their audience a mission that they believe in.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"AP An egg seller inside the central market with various types of fresh eggs in Livorno, Italy, on March 19, 2025. AP SCHOENEICHE, Germany \u2014 The U.S. government is on a global egg hunt, seeking exports from countries in Europe and elsewhere to ease a severe shortage that has caused egg prices at grocery stores to hit record highs. Germany, Italy, Poland and Sweden are among the nations the U.S. Department of Agriculture approached to address the shortage brought on by a bird flu outbreak, according to European industry groups. But supplying Americans with eggs would be complicated for foreign producers \u2014 and not because of political tensions over the myriad import tariffs President Donald Trump has imposed or threatened to impose on his nation's top trading partners. Advertisement Advertisement Even if they were eager to share, European countries don\u2019t have many surplus eggs because of their own avian flu outbreaks and the growing domestic demand ahead of Easter. One of the biggest obstacles, however, is the approach the United States takes to preventing salmonella contamination. U.S. food safety regulations require fresh eggs to be sanitized and refrigerated before they reach shoppers; in the European Union, safety standards call for Grade A eggs to be sold unwashed and without extended chilling. \u201cThese are two systems that could not be more different,\u201d said Hans-Peter Goldnick, the president of the German Egg Association. It is common in parts of Europe, for example, for consumers to buy eggs that still have feathers and chicken poop stuck to them. Farmer David Karlsch described the simple process that gets eggs from hens to customers of the family-owned Saballus poultry farm in Schoeneiche, a town just outside Germany\u2019s capital: The eggs are taken from nests, placed into cartons and sold on the premises or from a refrigerated vending machine just outside the property. \u201cThe demand at Easter time is of course very, very high, as many children naturally want to paint eggs,\u201d Karlsch said. Poland, a major egg exporter, fielded a U.S. query about the availability of eggs, according to Katarzyna Gawro\u0144ska, director of the National Chamber of Poultry and Feed Producers. The issue of washed vs. unwashed was a crucial factor as European officials considered such requests, she said. Eggs are not cleaned in most of the 27 EU nations because of concerns that removing the natural protective coating from eggshells makes them more vulnerable to bacteria, Gawro\u0144ska said. Polish veterinary officials are trying to determine if the country and its farmers can meet U.S. requirements, such as whether the exporting nation has a comparable food safety inspection system or a significant bird flu outbreak. Although European Union regulations state that table eggs \u201cshall not be washed or cleaned,\u201d member countries have some leeway if they authorized egg baths at packing plants decades ago. Danish Egg Association CEO J\u00f8rgen Nyberg Larsen said national customs are part of it; washed eggs are the norm in Sweden, for example. But Sweden and Norway have informed the U.S. they don't have extra eggs to export, Larsen said. For now, any increased U.S. egg imports from Europe are more likely to arrive in powdered form or other products that can be shipped frozen or dried, Larsen said. That's the response Poland's trade association gave U.S. officials. If the U.S. certifies Poland as a source, the organization's members would have a limited number of shell eggs to sell but could supply \u201cvery large volumes of egg processing products,\u201d Gawro\u0144ska said. Processed eggs usually are pasteurized to prevent foodborne illnesses and then used in food manufacturing or by restaurants, hospitals and nursing homes, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Baked goods, pasta and sauces like mayonnaise are some of the commercial products made with egg powder. U.S. officials also tried to sound out farmers in northern Italy's Veneto region for emergency egg supplies, according to Coldiretti, the main Italian agricultural lobbying organization. But Italy only produces enough eggs to cover the national demand so most of the region's producers said they could not help. Bird flu outbreaks since the start of last year also have taken a toll on the Italian poultry industry. Germany cannot contribute much either. Its domestic poultry industry generates about 73% of the eggs consumed in the country, \u201cand we ourselves essentially have to import eggs from Holland every day to keep everyone satisfied,\" the German Egg Association\u2019s Goldnick said. \u201cWe have around 45 million eggs that we can collect from the chicken coops every day, and in America, there\u2019s a shortage of around 50 million eggs a day. That shows how difficult it is,\u201d he said. Other countries the U.S. government contacted include Austria, Norway, Spain and Denmark. The U.S. Department of Agriculture said it secured new egg commitments from South Korea and Turkey in recent months, although it did not specify the amount or type. Brazil, which traditionally exports less than 1% of its total egg production, increased its February shipments to the U.S. by 93% compared to a year earlier, according to the Brazilian Association of Animal Protein. The detection of Newcastle disease, a viral condition often fatal to chickens, in some parts of Brazil impedes the South American nation's ability to become a significant U.S. egg supplier, market insiders say. Imports of liquid, frozen and dried eggs may help free up some domestic shell eggs for consumers, but the U.S. made its appeal for foreign eggs amid a significant deficit; last month, the country produced 720 million fewer table eggs than in February 2024, a decline of nearly 10%. The U.S. also cut its own egg exports to boost supplies at home, the Agriculture Department said. While the informal trade talks continue, the U.S. market has shown signs of improvement. It\u2019s been nearly a month since a major bird flu outbreak impacted egg-laying hens, the department said. It reported the national wholesale price for large eggs dropped to $3.27 per dozen as of March 21, or less than half its peak of $8.15 per dozen on Feb. 21. U.S. consumers are just starting to see those falling wholesale prices translate to lower prices on grocery shelves, the department said. The big demand for eggs that usually accompanies Easter and Passover could cause prices to edge up again next month. Trump hasn't exactly walked on eggshells with the people of Europe since starting his second term. The president's repeated threats to seize Greenland, a Danish territory, infuriated many in Denmark. His posture toward Ukraine and disparaging remarks from top members of his administration have alarmed America's European allies. The European Union, which is the third-largest trade partner of the U.S., was not exempted from the tariffs Trump ordered on steel, aluminum and automobiles. Bracing for more, it has prepared counter-tariffs on American products. But many officials in Europe say none of that would rule out exporting eggs. Goldnick said an egg producer friend recently told him that \u201cif the price is right, then I\u2019ll deliver.\u201d Any deals made or not would come down to business decisions, he said. \u201cI have two souls in my chest. On the one hand, I would say, 'No, we can\u2019t support this system,' but that\u2019s not the right answer,\" he said, referring to new U.S. tariffs on European goods. \u201cThe right answer is we have to help where we can, Goldnick continued. \"It doesn\u2019t concern the government. You wouldn\u2019t prop them up or anything, but it\u2019s just people\u2019s demand at Easter, for eggs, and that\u2019s just as important to satisfy in America as it is here.\u201d \u2014Gera reported from Warsaw, Poland.

{"date":"2025-03-28","content":"Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Published onMarch 28, 2025  With Nintendo\u2019s Direct event just days away, fans have been speculating about when they\u2019ll finally be able to secure a Switch 2. Now, internal documents apparently indicate that US pre-orders are set to begin on April 9, and retailers are already warning they\u2019ll likely sell out on day one. The information comes from emails and internal planning materials of a major US retailer, which were provided to Insider Gaming. According to the documents, stores are expecting limited allocations of the new console and are preparing for their entire stock to be claimed within hours of pre-orders going live. This is despite Nintendo purportedly stockpiling units ahead of launch. This info potentially muddies the water as to when pre-orders will open. Earlier this week, Best Buy Canada briefly published a blog post stating that the Switch 2 pre-order period would begin on April 2 north of the border \u2014 the same day as the upcoming Nintendo Direct. That mention was quickly removed, prompting speculation about whether it had been posted in error or prematurely. The new documents appear to contradict that timeline. They outline a post-event messaging strategy, including a \u201cPre-Order Coming Soon\u201d notice and a countdown clock that ends on April 9. It seems highly unlikely that pre-orders would begin a week earlier in Canada than in the US. While Nintendo has yet to confirm a release date or pre-order plans, the same retailer documents point to a June launch, which had been widely rumored. With leaks now pointing to different dates and limited stock expected across the board, Switch fans may want to mark both April 2 and April 9 on their calendars \u2014 and be ready to move fast either way.","label":1}

A few people who managed the minor miracle of tracking down a new Nvidia RTX 50-series graphics card were shocked and appalled to find that these GPUs were underperforming thanks to missing Render Output Units (ROPs). But as it turns out, buyers are so desperate for these new cards that at least one European vendor is trying to sell said underperforming defects as \u201cB-stock.\u201d German online store Alternate.de has a listing up for the Zotac RTX 5090 Solid OC, with its \u201cmissing\u201d ROPs spelled out right on the page. (The defective card only has 168 ROPs when it should have 176.) Those missing ROPs can result in up to 10 percent less performance. The price for this rough diamond? \u20ac2,899, or about $3,140 USD. For a card that Nvidia claims has a $2,000 MSRP without defective hardware. Alternate.de It\u2019s hard to tell what the current street price is for any of the recently launched Nvidia and AMD cards, but one Newegg listing shows the same Zotac card as $2,370. Out of stock, of course. And VideoCardz.com notes that no, you can\u2019t just use the warranty on the card and get Zotac to replace it with a 5090 that does have all its ROPs intact. The best you can hope for would be a return and refund from the retailer. It\u2019s pretty depressing that someone is selling a known defective card at well above the price of an unsullied GPU. It\u2019s even more depressing that, in the current marketplace, someone\u2019s probably going to buy it\u2014if not an actual PC gamer willing to pay more for less, then a reseller hoping to make a quick buck, with or without disclosing that this particular 5090 isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be.

I am very fussy and sensitive about scents. Most perfumes are way too floral and give me a headache. I caught a whiff of this on a woman who passed me at the movie theater.
