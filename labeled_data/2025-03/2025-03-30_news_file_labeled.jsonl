{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"Business Insider Edition  You know that sensation when something feels off, but you can't quite put your finger on it? That sensation of \"I don't feel so good about this,\" even though the \"this\" is a little fuzzy. That's the state of work for many people right now. So if you're a little uneasy about the job market, you're not alone.          The economy's felt like the other shoe is about to drop for quite some time now. There was the euphoria of the Great Resignation, the post-pandemic era where workers had a lot of temporary power and did some job-hopping. That gave way to the confusing negativity of the vibecession, when Americans said the economy was terrible even though, on paper, it was good \u2014 and, despite their negativity, consumers kept spending like it was good, too. Then we got to the Big Stay, where workers decided to stick to what they were doing, whether they were happy about it or not. Sentiment picked up a bit after the 2024 election when people thought a Trump 2.0 economy would look as rosy as they remembered Trump 1.0. But now, the bad vibes are back. Workers are not feeling great about the labor market or their own jobs. The Big Stay has transformed into the Big Cling to Your Desk, Suck Up to Your Boss, Be Seen in the Office.       Consumer sentiment has been on the downswing recently, in part because people are feeling queasy about work. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index fell in March, driven largely by declines in people's outlooks on income, business, and the labor market. The concerns about the future pushed the Conference Board's expectations index to its lowest point in 12 years, below the level that tends to signal a recession. While people feel OK about the current labor market, they're worried about their future employment prospects and their future incomes.               \"That's a sign that people are getting worried about their own situation,\" said Stephanie Guichard, a senior economist at The Conference Board, in an interview. She added that people are beginning to say they're more worried about their family financial situations, too. \"We are at the point where they may start changing their behavior.\"               Surveys from the University of Michigan reflect a similar doom-and-gloom mood toward the labor market. Consumers' expectations for unemployment over the next year are at their worst level since the Great Recession \u2014 two-thirds of them think unemployment will go up. According to the University of Michigan's most recent reading, consumer sentiment has declined across the economy, cutting across age, income, and politics, as people are feeling increasingly anxious about a wide variety of measures, including their own personal finances and the labor market. Even high-income consumers are worried about their situations.               As with the Conference Board's findings, the University of Michigan's survey shows people aren't just worried about the broader labor market, they're worried about themselves.               \"If labor markets truly weaken or people believe that labor markets are going to weaken, and now they're expecting their incomes to be less stable than they were before, they're not going to be willing to go out on a limb and spend at the same high level, take financial risks, make more investments, start new businesses,\" said Joanne Hsu, the director of consumer surveys at the University of Michigan. \"People are not going to be comfortable doing that if they're perceiving weaknesses throughout the economy.\"               On paper, the labor market remains quite solid. The unemployment rate is healthy relative to history, though it's a bit elevated from recent historic lows, and layoffs remain steady. The quit rate is a little below where it was pre-pandemic, which reflects the \"stay where you are\" attitude, but overall, signs from \"hard\" data are flashing yellow.               Daniel Zhao, the lead economist at Glassdoor, told me that mentions of layoffs in the platform's employee reviews are up by 5% compared to last year and are steadily climbing. \"Even if workers are still employed, that doesn't necessarily mean they are happy in their jobs,\" he said. Some of the commentary is from people talking about the ongoing effects of previous layoffs, expressing feelings of burnout because their workplaces are understaffed. Or, they're worried that they'll get swept up in the next round of cuts. \"Employees might not see any reason why there wouldn't be another round of layoffs if they feel like the business and the economy are in a similar position,\" he said.               People see the headlines about a white-collar recession, and they're unnerved, whether they're knowledge workers or not. They see the news that businesses may be rethinking hiring plans and wonder if they'd be able to find a new gig if necessary.               The word of the day is \"uncertainty\" \u2014 the US Economic Policy Uncertain Index is higher than it was during the pandemic. There's a constant sense of whiplash across many parts of the economy and politics. What's happening with tariffs seems to change daily. Announcements of mass government firings and confusing reinstatements are happening constantly. Many businesses and workers expected Donald Trump's second term to look like his first one, with tax cuts and relatively unserious tariff threats and a general business-friendly stance. Instead, they're faced with a new version of Trump whose tariff gyrations are making business planning impossible and who doesn't seem to care if the stock market falls because of his actions.               \"Everybody hates uncertainty, whether you're talking about executives down to front-line workers,\" Zhao said.               \"A lot of people only are like, 'Wow, the mix of policies is worse than I thought, but I'm not exactly sure what policies are being implemented and what I should prepare for,\" said Guy Berger, the director of economic research at the Burning Glass Institute, a labor-analytics firm.               There's a level of paralysis amid the chaos. With so much instability, many workers and businesses feel like they have no choice but to stay put. That means employees are sticking with their jobs, and businesses are easing off the gas on hiring plans until there's a better sense of what's going on.               \"People are hesitant to really even expand sizably or leave their job and find other ones that are a better fit,\" Allison Shrivastava, an economist at Indeed, said. \"Everybody's just kind of frozen, waiting and seeing.\"               Some of the worker sentiments and anxieties are not that different from, say, 2023 or 2024. There's long been a subtle recognition that nothing lasts forever, including an extra-worker-friendly jobs market. The vibes have been off for a few years now. But the economists I spoke with said that something distinct is happening that may make things different. Instead of gesturing broadly at the state of things, workers are specifically negative about their personal outlooks. The level of uncertainty in the economy is palpable. That means they may be likelier to decide to really batten down the hatches, try really hard to hold onto their jobs, and, in turn, start reigning in their spending. (Though that last one is TBD \u2014 throughout this inflationary and vibecessionary period, consumer spending has been remarkably resilient.)               \"Employees do feel pretty uncertain about the future,\" Zhao said.               Berger emphasized that just because workers feel worse doesn't mean they're right that things actually are worse. As mentioned, on paper, the labor market and economy look pretty good. Stocks are down, yes, but as the saying goes, the stock market is not the economy.               \"So far, everything we've seen in terms of data is pretty small scale,\" he said. \"There's nothing here that so far suggests that we've fallen into this doom loop where we're going to tip into a downturn where things are going to get worse. If I had to guess, it's going to be an incremental worsening.\"               For workers who are on edge, the idea of incremental worsening isn't especially heartening. That means many people may be making the calculation that it's better to stay where they are, avoid asking for too much, and hope to stay in the boss' good graces.

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"Business Insider Edition  Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we round up some of our top stories and take you inside our newsroom. With \"Signalgate\" dominating headlines, BI's Katie Notopoulos wants to know: Which high-ranking official's group chat texting style most matches yours? Let her know here for an upcoming story!  On the agenda today:   But first: Googlers have questions.       If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Business Insider's app here.           We've written a lot about the tech industry's hardcore moment. Talk of efficiency and intensity has replaced perks and pampering. Rolling layoffs have become the norm. Management layers are thinning. AI can help companies do more with less.               Now, at least at Google, some employees aren't pleased about their recent compensation packages. And they're speaking out about it.               Some Google employees received smaller pay bumps in their 2025 compensation packages than they anticipated, according to an exclusive report from my BI colleague Hugh Langley. Googlers raised the issue at a recent company all-hands, per a meeting transcript that Hugh obtained, where they wondered why some employees had seen a decrease in their refreshed stock grants and overall comp.               A Google exec at the all-hands said some employees in less technical roles received smaller equity packages this year to calibrate pay to local markets.               But the story got me thinking about how Google's lower comp fits into the changing tech industry. I spoke with Hugh about his reporting and what it means for Google.       Steve: What's the reaction to your scoop?   Hugh: Whenever I write about compensation, I get a lot of feedback from employees across Big Tech. I know some of these stories can have a \"world's smallest violin\" feeling to them \u2014 Googlers, on the whole, are still paid very well! But in the battle for talent, this stuff really matters.       What impact do you see this having on Google's workforce?           The fact it got raised during the company's all-hands means it's on a lot of employees' minds. The biggest possible impact is a hit to morale, especially for employees in non-technical roles that have been dinged hardest.       As the tech industry becomes more hardcore about work, how do you see Google fitting into that overall trend?           Google is certainly going hardcore, but in typical Google fashion, it's doing it less dramatically, less publicly, and without any of the political chest-thumping we've seen from the likes of Meta. Googlers once felt they were the only ones safe from layoffs, but now rolling job cuts have become the new norm. It's also chopped away at management layers and in some cases set a higher bar for performance.               Of course, there are plenty of employees who see this all as a good thing, but there's a feeling among many staff that the era of mollycoddling at Alphabet is well and truly over.               Many assumed Elon Musk's proximity to President Donald Trump would be a net positive \u2014 but the opposite has proven to be true. Musk's involvement with DOGE has triggered an identity crisis within Tesla.               Over the years, Tesla and its CEO have faced dire predictions, but each time they seem to have emerged stronger. However, for some employees, analysts, and investors, Musk's political entanglements represent a new challenge.       Why this time feels different.   Also read:           The business of buying and selling companies is slowing down. Buyout funds recently underperformed the stock market for the first time in decades.               But that doesn't mean PE vets and newcomers have to fret. Certain opportunities are in demand, and \u2014 if you're more junior \u2014 there's good news for you, too.       What to know about PE careers.           Since CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg started calling for more \"masculine energy\" in the workplace, a small group of their female colleagues has been organizing their resistance.               Some female executives worry that big business's latest testosterone injection could push them out of leadership roles. Others see it as galvanizing, a sign that women are making serious progress.       \"The masks and the gloves are off.\"           \"If a billionaire can steal from me, I can scrape a little off the top, too.\" That's how one person justifies stealing little treats from Whole Foods.               Middle-class shoplifters and thieves of opportunity are fudging Amazon returns and sneaking Whole Foods goods to stick it to The Man \u2014 whose name, in this case, is Jeff Bezos. The problem is that small-time swiping doesn't actually effect the change these anti-Amazon avengers want to see.       Worse, it could be causing unintended harm.   This week's quote:           \"We are catching a lot of balls, with very little people. Eventually one of them is probably going to fall.\"               \u2014 A NOAA employee concerned about how DOGE's job cuts at the agency will affect extreme weather alerts and air travel forecasts.

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"In March 2001, Nintendo introduced an advanced portable model to the gaming market with the release of the Game Boy Advance (GBA, codenamed Advanced Game Boy or AGB). Equipped with a modernized 32-bit ARM CPU running at twice the speed of the Game Boy Color (GBC), this small device was more than capable of playing SNES-like games\u2014still at the price of only two AA batteries. The third major Game Boy revision indeed again proved to be a smashing hit, breaking various sales records during its relatively short lifespan. According to Eurogamer, in the United Kingdom, the GBA sold four times as much units in its first first week of release as the PlayStation 2. Although Gunpei Yoko\u2019s \u201cLateral Thinking with Withered Technology\u201d design philosophy was still applied (the system was still cheap: priced at $99.99\u2014About $146.37 in 2020), it was clear that the technical specifications of the GBA were put into the spotlight. Why else would you name something \u201cAdvance\u201d or put \u201c32 bit\u201d on the box? It almost feels like a poor apology: \u201cWe\u2019re sorry about the GBC. This time, the model really is advanced, we promise!\u201d It becomes even more obvious when looking at a selection of the system\u2019s launch titles that liked to brag about the capabilities of the new Game Boy model: Next to showcasing the GBA\u2019s strengths, the games also showed its biggest weakness: there was still no backlit screen. This became especially painful for Castlevania fans like me: the grim setting did not exactly benefit from highly contrasting colors like the more cheerful Super Mario Advance did. Without a proper light source, this often resulted in a dark gooey mess that made an already punishing difficulty even more frustrating. Complaints about the contrast even made Konami go all out on the colors for their the next GBA Castlevania game, Harmony of Dissonance, that was criticized for\u2026 it\u2019s too bright color palette.     Castlevania: Circle of the Moon, played indoors on a cloudy day (left, simulated). You better mash that attack button since the background and foreground are barely distinguishable... Right: running in the mGBA emulator. With the ample contrast from a PC screen, the Skeleton Bomber on the right stands out.  This problem was not new but made even more pressing since, compared to its predecessor, the palette size dramatically increased and the picture resolution was boosted by 66%. These features delivered sharp pictures with little motion blur\u2014as long as you could see what you were doing. Circle of the Moon did age beautifully, provided you play it on a more modern system that enables you to easily spot the eminent dangers in the castle corridors. Instead of only attracting newcomers to the handheld gaming scene, engineers at Nintendo made sure to keep their regular customers happy as well by shipping the hardware with a second CPU: the trusty old Sharp LR35902. This enabled GBA machines to play GB and GBC games with no compromises. Since the GBA screen is horizontally-oriented and the original Game Boy was not, players were given the option to either play at the intended aspect ratio or to stretch the image to fill the GBA\u2019s screen by pressing L orR. Both options come at a cost: either the actual image size is smaller than the original handheld, or the image is blurry. Backwards compatibility was, and still is, a huge selling point. In the fall of 2001, home console players would be left in the cold again as Nintendo finally switched from cartridge-based games on the N64 to mini-DVDs on the GameCube. Fortunately, Nintendo handheld consoles were consistently developed with compatibility in mind: the GBC plays GB games, the GBA plays GB and GBC games, the Nintendo DS plays GBA games, and the Nintendo 3DS plays DS games. In addition, the Nintendo 3DS eShop sold various older handheld games. And yes, the Goomba Color emulator technically allows you to play GB\/GBC games on your Game Boy Micro or Nintendo DS using a GBA flash cart. Inspecting the lifespan of the Nintendo handhelds yields a few interesting facts. The clever decision to engineer revisions of the original hardware significantly prolonged the lifespan of the Game Boy, by then already going strong for seven years. The frequent hardware revision strategy became common for all Nintendo handhelds.     The lifespan of Nintendo handhelds and consoles. First group (lightgreen): the Game Boy family. Second group (darkgreen): the GBA family. Consoles are marked in orange. The Nintendo 3DS (not pictured), part of the eighth generation, saw the light in 2011.  The GBA was only two years old when it got its first revision, the SP\u2014that\u2019s a lot quicker than the seven year gap between the original and the Pocket. That faster cadence was maintained when looking at the Nintendo DS and 3DS. However, the total lifespan of the GBA\u2014apart from the eccentric GB Micro\u2014was much shorter than the GB family: the GBA came in 2001 and went in 2004 as the DS was released. And yet, Nintendo did not at all drop support for the GBA. Then why would a company release another handheld that poses a threat to its own product? An IGN press report from November 2003 sheds some light on this: Early Thursday morning Nintendo confirmed that it had posted a loss for the beginning half of the fiscal year, the first time ever in the company\u2019s history. It also said it would develop a new game product which would not be the successor to GameCube or GBA for release in 2004, but no further details were specified. The company was struggling to keep up in the console race, with Sony\u2019s PlayStation stealing N64\u2019s thunder and Microsoft entering the market with the Xbox in 2001. The GameCube was doing pretty bad compared to the PS2. Nintendo initially did not intend for the Nintendo DS to succeed the GBA, although in the end, it of course did. Instead, they were looking for something in-between a console and classic gaming handheld, something that would appeal to a much broader audience than just gamers. A slew of successful non-gamer friendly software titles such as Dr. Kawashima\u2019s Brain Training and Nintendogs did just that. Ultimately, the Nintendo DS family sold almost twice as much as the GBA family. The huge success of the DS launch did not stop Nintendo from releasing another revision for the GBA, though: the tiny Game Boy Micro.  With dimensions of only 50\u00d7101\u00d717.2 mm and a weight of 80 g, tiny is definitely the correct word to use. According to the then Vice President George Harrison, the Game Boy line was Nintendo\u2019s testbed where they continuously and intentionally aspired to invent instead of merely reiterate. However, inventing does not necessarily mean commercial success. Indeed, according to financial reports in 2007, the Game Boy Micro was Nintendo\u2019s worst selling handheld ever, only clocking in about 2.5 million units. Then Nintendo President Satoru Iwata later admitted that the Nintendo DS may have kept the Micro from performing better sales-wise: The sales of Micro did not meet our expectations. Micro showed different sales in and outside Japan. In Japan, initial sales of Micro were rather good and it did become a rather hot topic. So, there was the possibility for this product to grow in Japan. However, toward the end of 2005, Nintendo had to focus almost all of our energies on the marketing of DS, which must have deprived the Micro of its momentum. This is why Micro couldn\u2019t meet our expectations in Japan. Project Atlantis, the fitting codename for a new Game Boy, was sunk in 1997 for the same reason: Nintendo feared a new model would get in the way of the original Game Boy that still had a firm grasp of the handheld market. Atlantis was designed to be a proper successor to the original Game Boy, supposedly equipped with a 32-bit processor and a color screen. Instead, Nintendo again showed its conservative side by prolonging the Game Boy lifespan with the GBC. The 32-bit CPU idea was preserved in the freezer until 2001. The overlapping lifespans of consoles compared to the handhelds is also worth looking at. When the GBC saw the light in 1998, the Nintendo 64 was already trying to prove itself as the SNES successor for two years. The lifespan of successive consoles and handhelds did shorten a little as the hardware engineering time decreased, eventually coinciding the lifespan of handhelds with consoles of the previous generation. Several NES games were ported to GBC1, sometimes even boasting improved graphics (Dragon Quest I\/II, Super Mario Bros.). The GBA has jokingly be called \u201ca portable SNES\u201d, and the Nintendo DS hardware made it possible to run a modified version of Super Mario 64 and Diddy Kong Racing on it, before the 3DS brought the big guns with The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D and even excellent ports of GameCube games such as Luigi\u2019s Mansion.     The GBA PCBs, front (top) and back (bottom), revision 03.  There\u2019s surprisingly little to see on the PCBs pictured above, as most components, including the second CPU, are embedded into the CPU-AGB casing in the middle. The chip on the top right is the 256 KB WRAM. The crystal to the left of the CPU runs at 4.194 MHz, as indicated on top o it: that is the same speed as the original Game Boy. The effective CPU speed was doubled for GBC and quadrupled for GBA games! The last visible chip on the front of the PCB is the LCD regulator marked AGB-REG, at the far left. The back of the motherboard showcases the amplifier on the lower left (AMP AGB), close to the volume potentiometer and the speaker. The messy ribbon connector and red wire is the result of my unprofessional attempt at replacing the stock screen with a backlit one. The new screen taps into the power supply of the GBA via that wire. Since the CPU is located at the back of the PCB this time, no aluminum shield is required to separate it from the cartridge slot. However, great care is needed when reassembling the unit with a thicker custom screen that puts a fair amount of pressure on the CPU casing. Technically, the GBA was about twice as fast as the GBC and had eight times that much memory: At first sight, these numbers look impressive compared to Nintendo\u2019s SNES that housed the slower 16-bit Ricoh 5A22 processor. Both PPUs have similar capabilities, also including DMA and HDMA systems for speedy memory read\/write cycles. However, perhaps the most noticeable difference is the lack of a proper audio subsystem. The two DAC components merely stream and convert bytes into analog audio waves (at a painfully low 8-bit resolution): mixing and applying effects had to be done in software, consuming precious CPU cycles. Nintendo hoped game developers partially relied on the Sharp co-processor to produce 8-bit sound effects, which in the end few games utilized efficiently. Another feature borrowed from the SNES was the addition of the shoulder buttons. The action buttons X and Y had to wait until the DS. Whether the GBA designers borrowed the horizontal handheld layout from Sega\u2019s Game Gear, we\u2019ll probably never know. The decision did make the system more comfortable to hold and play for longer periods. The screen of the GBC could already handle 15-bit RGB values but the small memory footprint of the hardware limited the color palette. The GBA, with its more comfortable memory size, increased the color range from 56 to 256 for the foreground and another 256 for the background. Instead of waiting seven years to redesign the first Advanced model, The GBA \u201cSP\u201d (codenamed AGS) was released only two years after the original GBA. The fairly new horizontal layout was promptly thrown out of the window in favor of a model that resembles the GBC, except that the clamshell design enabled you to fold it in half. A closed GBA SP, measuring only about 8.4 cm, was finally the ultimate pocketable gaming machine. According to Nintendo, the redesign was issued to address two major complaints of the original design. First, it was supposedly uncomfortable to use, hence the new layout. In practice, most players complained that it was in fact the SP model that hurt their hands, locking fingers in a cramped position because of the new clamshell design. Second, the complaints about the contrast of the screen were finally taken into account. Well, not entirely. The first SP model (AGS-001) included an internal front-light that could be toggled on and off. It acts as a Game Boy with an embedded Light Boy accessory. The result was better than the first GBA, but still not great, as frontlit LCD screens tend to have washed out colors. Fortunately, the revised revision (AGS-101) finally included a proper backlit screen\u2014although you had to wait another two years for that, and Europeans were disadvantaged again with the extremely limited availability. The GBA SP ended an era of hauling a slew of AA (or, in the case of the Pocket, AAA) batteries together with your favorite handheld system. An integrated rechargeable lithium-ion battery compartment was finally introduced, that, according to the official specifications, should keep you busy up to eighteen hours, provided the screen light is disabled. The comfort that was gained with the charging system was suddenly lost once you wanted to plug in your headphones: the headphone jack disappeared, in favor of an awkward adapter\u2014to be bought separately, of course\u2014that plugs into the same AC port as the power charger. Without even more adapters, it was impossible to use headphones and charge the system simultaneously. Take that, spare AA batteries. In 2005, Nintendo brought back the horizontal layout by introducing the Game Boy Micro, codenamed OXY. It looks like the result of a how-small-can-we-possibly-go contest: measuring just 10 cm wide and 5 cm long, and weighing only 80 g, this petite Game Boy could even slip in the same pocket as your keys. Although you better not do that since the casing was metallic this time and thus scratches easily. Also, you run into the risk of fishing out your Micro instead of your car key since both are equally small.     A comparison of Game Boy screen sizes (actual size). Dimensions in millimeter. GBA aspect ratios are 3:2 (in purple), while GB aspect ratios are approximately 10:9 (in orange for GBC, in gray for Pocket and Classic).  Roughly one third of the screen size disappeared. However, the reduced size did deliver extremely crisp images as the pixels per inch or PPI increased from 99 to 144. Together with a nice and bright backlit screen, the Micro almost creates the illusion of being able to play GBA games at High Definition image quality. Oh, and the headphone jack returned. Is this the one Game Boy system to rule them all? That depends on whether backwards compatibility is high on your priority list, as Nintendo decided, for the very first time in their handheld division, to drop support for older Game Boy cartridges. It might not come to a big surprise considering the physical size of the machine. A small portion of the 8-bit Sharp CPU is still present since GBA games could make use of its 4-channel APU.     A comparison of Game Boy device sizes (actual size). Dimensions in millimeter.      A simplified schematic of the GBA hardware architecture. Memory components are marked in orange (BIOS ROMs not depicted). Components are connected with a hybrid 8-bit (GBC ROM, SRAM) Based on Rodrigo Copetti's Game Boy Diagram.  Twelve years of technological progress since the original Game Boy is clearly reflected in the GBA architecture. For example, the meager 8KB RAM module that used to sit on the PCB next to the CPU has now been partially embedded by splitting RAM into bigger IWRAM (Internal Work RAM) and EWRAM (External Work RAM) chunks, thus enabling faster data access speeds. The presence of the 8-bit Sharp CPU did not mean work could be offloaded to this co-processor. It was only there to make sure the machine was backwards compatible with older game cartridges. However, programmers could still access the older CPU\u2019s APU unit to produce retro sounds. A hardware cartridge selector switch determines which CPU and BIOS to activate. Even if the CPU can indeed work with 32-bit data without consuming extra cycles, most components, including most memory blocks (except IWRAM), are connected to the central system using only a 16-bit bus. This decision, and the absence of a proper music chip, further reduced manufacturing costs. Another difference compared to the original GB is the lack of a MBC component on GBA cartridges. The full 32 MB ROM data is mapped onto the address space without having to read in chunks of a few kilobytes. The GBA still relies on the memory-mapped IO concept and there is, for better or for worse, still no Operating System to deal with. The address space did increase from 16-bit ($0000 to $FFFF on the GB) to 32-bit ($00000000 to $FFFFFFFF) to accommodate the increased size of most subsystems. The full address space looks like this:     A visual representation of the GBA's 32-bit address space. Based on DuoDreamer's DreamScape Game Boy Memory Map.  In essence, programming on the GBA did not differ much from the GB. It was still a machine that required you to fiddle with addresses. Fortunately, this time, it came with the advantages of software development in the early twenty-first century: high level programming languages, proper debug tools, better compilers and documentation, and last but not least: internet access in case things go awry. Games were written in the C programming language, so developers were finally relieved of constructing intricate but tiresome assembly routines. Sadly, the latter statement turned out to be too good to be true. The GBA CPU chip came with a few perks that were absolutely essential to master. Instead of its older brother, the 8-bit Sharp CPU, the 32-bit ARM7TDMI RISC CPU did not come equipped with one but with two instruction sets! The ARM company created their own standard instruction set for all ARM CPUs, thoughtfully called the ARM instruction set. The CPU understands 32-bit A32 instructions, which is an ARM dialect in pre-ARMV8 architectures. Instead of the 8-bit Game Boy load instruction LD A,B, we now write LDR A,B. The result is the same: LD (LoaD) or LDR (Load RegisteR) are just verbs of different languages. Since the ARM core is much more advanced than the older Sharp core, its instruction set is more powerful. Remember, the ARM7 processor has 16 32-bit registers available. However, ARM code translates into 32 occupied bits. That is a lot on a limited machine. 00010111000000000001100000000111 is just one instruction. To increase the code density, programmers could decide to use the second available instruction set instead, called Thumb mode. These Thumb instructions are a subset of ARM: everything that can be expressed as Thumb can also be written as ARM, but not (that easily) the other way around. Thumb instructions only occupy 16 bits, half of the size of ARM code. The most compelling reason to use Thumb was not its reduced size, but its increased speed while accessing 16-bit bus subsystems such as EWRAM. The problem with using a 32-bit based instruction set such as ARM is that everything will be expressed as 32-bit data. That means 16-bit data will get converted into 32-bit data, wasting a precious cycle in the process. Since most GBA subsystems have 16-bit buses, it only makes sense to use a 16-bit instruction set: Thumb. In practice, both ARM and Thumb saw its use. Most C code would get compiled into Thumb assembly, after which hand optimizing crucial sections will be done in ARM, also making use of the 32-bit IWRAM. Creating games that brought out the best of the GBA ultimately required proficiency of three programming languages: C, ARM assembly, and Thumb assembly. Another big advantage of the ARM7TDMI2 core is the embedded three-stage pipeline. A typical fetch\/decode\/execute machine cycle is a sequential process: the next fetch will have to wait until the decode and execute steps have been completed. With instruction pipelining, parallelism can be achieved on a single processor. The idea is simple: keep all parts of the CPU as busy as possible. Once the first instruction has been fetched, it can be decoded. But the part responsible for fetching should not idle: instead, it can already fetch the second instruction, and so forth. Pipelining significantly reduces throughput time, as visible in the figure below. Pipelining instructions comes with its own set of problems. For instance, what if the second instruction is dependent on the output of the first? There are multiple workarounds possible that go far beyond the scope of this article. Pipelining is also easier to achieve on the GBA than on the GB since a RISC processor guarantees each execute block will take only one cycle.     A three-stage instruction pipeline model: the second instruction starts its fetching procedure while the first is still decoding.  Imagine your mother doing laundry. In the above figure, replace \u201cFetch\u201d with washing, \u201cDecode\u201d with drying, and \u201cExecute\u201d with ironing. The GBA CPU (or should we call it mom?) is able to put clothes from the washing machine directly into the dryer, enabling a second batch to be immediately washed. In the meantime, dried clothes can be ironed. The original Game Boy puts clothes in the washing machine and waits for the program to finish. It then transfers them to the dryer to wait some more. Hopefully it is clear that the GBA mother is a lot more efficient in doing laundry! Thanks to the rise of online communities, the GBA homebrew development scene is still thriving. Toolchains such as devkitPro make it easy for enthusiasts to create GBA games using newer multi-paradigm programming languages like Rust and C++. This makes the GBA an excellent choice for learning about both hardware architecture and software development: its predecessor lacked software development tools and its successor increased the hardware complexity. Hardware accessory producers rejoiced every time Nintendo released a new revision of their popular Game Boy franchise, and the release of the GBA was no different. Since it took two years for Nintendo to ship a GBA with any kind of screen light, different \u201cAfterburner\u201d products sold well. With these modification kits, you could install a frontlight on your GBA yourself, although sometimes soldering and tinkering with the plastic housing was required. The Pok\u00e9mon FireRed\/LeafGreen GBA remakes included an official Wireless Adapter that finally got rid of the Link Cable, allowing players to catch \u2019em all without catching each other. More than thirty players could simultaneously join a lobby to battle or trade. In the end, only a few games supported Wireless play, since it was released in 2004, the same year as the Nintendo DS launched.  Many accessories, including this one, were incompatible with the smaller Game Boy Micro.     If you squint your eyes, the Wireless Adapter even looks like a Pok\u00e9mon.  A successor to the SNES Super Game Boy called the Game Boy Player allowed you to play GB, GBC, and GBA games on your GameCube. Some games even provided force feedback through the GameCube controllers. The Nintendo GameCube GBA Cable was an equally impressive way to connect the GBA to the GC, allowing you to play minigames or even use the GBA as an extra screen for a second player. In case you don\u2019t own a GameCube: the unofficial Super Retro Advance cartridge allows you to play GBA games on your SNES. It has its own separate composite-video only output. You\u2019ve been warned. A (very expensive) Nintendo 64 solution also exists, called Wide Boy 64. Then there\u2019s the e-Reader, a Game Changer that lets you put three games in it and change on-the-fly, the obligatory cheat device, a Japan-only cartridge that lets you play movies and music from an SD card called Play-Yan, a car charger, and a battery replacement kit.

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with 38-year-old Robert Furst, a senior VP at Merrill Lynch, a wealth management division of the Bank of America. The following has been edited for length and clarity. I was really fortunate to have amazing role models in my life, and I'm very intentional about being a role model for my kids. I joined Merrill Lynch in 2013. I provide wealth management advice to our clients, who include business owners, professional athletes, doctors, and lawyers. At my job, I've focused a lot on educating the next generation about finances. It's given me a cheat code for dealing with my own kids, who are six and four. Here are some of the key ways I've decided to teach my kids about financial literacy and how I'm planning ahead to set them up for financial success. I don't think my children are too young to learn about gratitude, compassion, and appreciation. If we start those habits early, they will stay with them for the rest of their lives. My kids save money in piggy banks for charitable giving. When they've accumulated enough funds, they'll choose, with a little guidance, where to donate those funds. At four and six, my wife and I want our kids to focus on saving for charities and helping the less fortunate. When my six year old turns seven and starts first grade, I'll introduce him to investing and we will explore what stocks he would want to create his first portfolio. My kids have a head start in life with two loving parents with good jobs. We've already started putting money away for college.  I want to teach them that once a family has \"enough\" it is crucial to give back. My dad worked in finance and would cut articles out of the Wall Street Journal for me to read. He treated me like his \"junior partner\" and talked to me about business decisions he made at work. When I got birthday money as a kid, I told my dad I wanted to invest it. He let me and this spurred my interest in the market. I saw the power of making a good investment. I'm planning to introduce my oldest child to investing soon. I want him to use his money to pick some companies to invest in, so he can feel the impact of decisions he makes. Nowadays, it's relatively easy to open a Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) account and let my children pick some stocks. I do a lot of investment coaching with the children of our clients. Once, a 12-year-old visited our office. We pulled the research reports for companies he'd picked and discussed what can indicate an advisable or ill-advised investment.  By pulling research reports of companies he selected, the child felt heard and respected. The child learned financial terms associated with stock research, so next time he wants to do some digging, jargon will not be a barrier to entry. I absolutely intend to do this with my children. It's not about getting kids to have amazing returns. It's about getting them engaged. If they invest for long enough, they can also see the power of compounding. Time in the market beats timing the market. I once asked my parents for a video game system, and my mom told me she wouldn't pay for it. I ended up working in a friend of my dad's factory doing simple jobs like packing boxes. Soon, I had enough money to buy myself the game system. I won't have my kids working in factories, but they do know that their parents value hard work.  Sometimes, my children will ask why my wife or I have to work late. We let them know that we strive to provide a good life for the family and that we work hard to earn money to pay for food, our home, and their education. I want them to know that nothing is guaranteed in life. I intend to pay them for chores. It could be as simple as making their beds. That's not a high-value item, but it's worth something to me if my wife and I don't have to do it. One of my financial goals is to send both of my kids to college debt-free, so I set up a 529 plan as soon as they had Social Security numbers. A 529 is a tax-advantaged education investment account that can help a child to attend college without incurring debt. Each child has their own 529. This is important because my children are of different ages and I'll invest in their 529s in line with when they go to college. As we get closer to college, we'll lessen the risk level because the money will need to be spent sooner. I also want to accumulate enough wealth to give my children choices in life. If one wants to work in finance or tech, they may not need help from my wife and me. But if one of them wants to become a social worker, the financial rewards might look a little different. I don't want my kids to be held back from doing amazing work in the community for financial reasons. We want to support them so they can make that choice without worrying about the salary difference.  Several families I have counseled help subsidize a child who worked diligently in a less lucrative career, and this is something I admired. We're planning for this by setting money aside and only buying what we need. We can afford to buy more luxury goods than we do, and that's by design. I'll probably tell my kids that we've got this money set aside for them when they're around college age. I don't want to tell them too early as I wouldn't want them to rely on it.

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"The UK would not hesitate to retaliate against US tariffs if needed, according to Downing Street sources. The government is in last-minute negotiations with the White House ahead of a 25% tax on car imports and threats of wider tariffs on other goods on 2 April.  It is trying to get an exemption, arguing that - unlike other countries - the UK has a relatively equal trading relationship with the US. The prime minister has said he does not want to jump into a trade war. US President Donald Trump has introduced a series of tariffs targeting goods from other countries, arguing the measures will help American manufacturers and protect jobs despite warnings prices could go up for consumers. Charges for businesses in the US importing vehicles will start on 3 April, with taxes on parts set to start in May or later.  Government sources have said the negotiations for a UK exemption would not end after Trump's deadline on Wednesday, with one saying \"we won't stop trying\". If tariffs do come into effect, what retaliation from the UK might look like is unclear. There are a range of options from duties on sectors where British products are particularly important to the US, to focusing on specific products like Harley Davidson motorcycles.  One expert told the BBC the \"nuclear\" - and most unlikely - possibility would be targeting financial services.  But despite UK threats, ministers do not want a trade war. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said earlier this week the UK would not be \"jumping into\" one with the US, adding the government was trying to avoid tariffs through \"intense negotiations\" and would be \"pragmatic and clear-eyed\" in its response. The independent Office for Budget Responsibility has warned a reciprocal trade war would wipe billions off economic growth and all but eliminate the surplus the chancellor has left to stay within her self-imposed fiscal rules. Dame Meg Hillier, a former Labour minister and chair of the Commons Treasury Select Committee, has warned the government's commitment to free trade was going to be tested over the next few weeks as a result of Trump's tariffs.  Trump has said the 25% levy would lead to \"tremendous growth\" for the industry, promising it would spur jobs and investment in the US. But there are concerns the move is likely to lead to the temporary shutdown of significant car production in the US, increase prices, and strain relations with allies. The US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade and roughly half of overall sales - and Mexico was the top supplier of cars to the country, followed by South Korea, Japan, Canada, and Germany. UK car exports are worth about \u00a37.6bn per year, and the US is the second largest market for UK cars after the European Union, according to car industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The SMMT said the announcement from Trump was \"not surprising but, nevertheless, disappointing\". World leaders criticised the tariffs shortly after they were announced. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck said on Thursday the European Union must \"respond firmly\", while France's President Emmanuel Macron called it a \"waste of time\" and urged Trump to reconsider. Critically endangered Galapagos tortoises Abrazzo and Mommy are parents of four hatchlings at Philadelphia Zoo High winds and heavy rain were expected to continue into Sunday, delaying clean-up efforts.

More in New York City. Stocks fell again in morning trading as investors continue to show concerns over the stability of global banks following the collapse last week of Silicon Valley Bank.  (Photo by Spencer Platt\/Getty Images) The stock market selloff has laid bare a crisis of confidence on Wall Street over Washington\u2019s policy direction, and tax-cut optimism \u2014 even the cuts themselves \u2014 may be not enough to lift investor spirits. \u201cThe pace and sequencing of policy reform appear to have structurally impaired confidence, impeding growth forecasts,\u201d said Lisa Shalett, Chief Investment Officer at Morgan Stanley, in a note to clients. Meanwhile, the policy pivot to deregulation and tax relief Wall Street has been banking on since the election remains elusive. The problem isn\u2019t just politics; the math simply doesn\u2019t add up. Even under the Republican base case, the cost of extending existing tax cuts is pegged at $4.5 trillion over the next decade. That\u2019s more than double the proposed spending cuts of $1.5 to $2.0 trillion, much of which would have to come from Medicaid and Medicare. \u201cEven in the best-case scenario, the implication is limited genuine progress on the 10-year debt and deficit forecast,\u201d Shalett wrote. Investors hoping for growth from new cuts like the repeal of the SALT cap or exemptions on tip income may also be disappointed. According to Shalett, \u201cmany of the proposals fall into [high fiscal multiplier] categories\u2026 [and] this is a very regressive policy stance, with the negative impacts unlikely to be offset by positive effects from tax cuts for higher-income households and corporations.\u201d The administration has floated tariffs as a revenue solution, but here, the assumptions are questionable. According to the Trump administration estimates, fully implemented tariffs \u2014 25% on Mexico and Canada, 10% on China \u2014 could generate $120 billion annually. But that figure is based on \u201ca maximalist scenario enduring for a decade,\u201d Shalett noted. In reality, about half of Canadian and Mexican imports will be exempt under USMCA, and any revenue gains would likely be offset by retaliation, substitution, and declining import volumes. \u201cTariff-revenue offsets [are] elusive,\u201d Shalett added, and the unpredictability of trade policy has only made matters worse. The S&P 500 may have pulled back, but it\u2019s still not broadly cheap. Shalett noted that \u201cwith upcoming fiscal drag likely to weigh on earnings estimates, the S&P 500 is still not broadly cheap, despite improved risk premiums.\u201d Consensus earnings expectations have already dropped 3.5% for Q1. Shalett expects that \u201cnegative revisions [will] continue, undermining the \u2018value\u2019 argument that may be emerging from the drawdown.\u201d Her advice is to stay selective. \u201cConsider being opportunistic amid recent turbulence,\u201d she said, pointing to stable growers in software, health care, and media, as well as financials and regional diversification in EM, Japan, and Europe. As she put it. \u201cToo soon to declare the \u2018all clear,\u2019 the market will likely remain volatile and idiosyncratic.\u201d","label":1}

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"ByBill Stone  ByBill Stone,  Contributor.  According to Strategas Research Partners, the size of the contemplated tariffs to be announced on ... More Wednesday could bring the total to $300 billion, or 1% of U.S. GDP. (Photo by Justin Sullivan\/Getty Images) While the economic data was a bit softer on the margin last week, markets were likely rattled more by concerns about the upcoming tariff announcements on President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d scheduled for Wednesday, April 2. Though the range of possible outcomes is extensive, the scope and size of the tariffs should be meaningful. Goldman Sachs estimates a five-percentage-point increase in tariffs trims 1% to 2% from S&P 500 earnings growth. So, Goldman Sachs has lowered its 2025 earnings per share growth estimate to 7%. Strategas Research Partners notes that the size of the contemplated tariffs could bring the total size to $300 billion, or 1% of U.S. GDP. China, Canada, Mexico, and the European Union as a group account for almost 50% of imports in the U.S. Following COVID-19 and the last trade war, supply chains have made progress in diversifying away from China. Share Of U.S. Imports: Last 12 Months While supply chains have reduced their dependence on China, it still has the largest trade surplus with the U.S., making it likely to remain subject to significant and possibly increased tariffs. Mexico and Canada also have large trade surpluses, so they are targets. Notably, the U.S. has significant leverage with many large trading partners as their exports to the U.S. make up a large enough portion of their GDP. If sizable tariffs crimp their net exports to the U.S., as would be expected, their economic growth will suffer. The European Union has a significant trade surplus with the U.S., so they are expected to be targeted when the administration proceeds with reciprocal tariffs this week. Reciprocal tariffs are meant to place U.S. tariffs equal to those experienced by U.S. goods imported into that region. If value-added taxes are included in the reciprocal calculation by the administration, then the tariffs on the European Union will be significantly higher than if only their tariff rates are considered. Selected Countries With Large Trade Surplus With The U.S. President Trump\u2019s use of tariffs and threats of additional tariffs has added to the policy uncertainty. Without knowing the size, duration, and cost to alternatively source the impacted imported product, it is impossible to estimate the impact of any future tariffs accurately. Furthermore, possible retaliation and the second-order effects must be considered. Generally speaking, tariffs should be a headwind to economic growth as higher prices have a tax-like impact on consumer spending. They are likely to boost inflation readings on the margin, though all the increased costs might not be passed on to consumers, and strength in the U.S. dollar could provide further offsets. As we have experienced since mid-February, all other things equal, uncertainty lowers the valuation investors are willing to pay for risk assets such as stocks. While the outcome is unclear, the Baker, Bloom, and Davis composite index of economic policy uncertainty measures policy uncertainty by examining the frequency of media references to it. U.S. Policy Uncertainty According to an analysis by Strategas Research Partners, stocks usually do quite well following periods of policy uncertainty. For example, policy uncertainty at current levels has, on average, been followed by over 20% returns from the S&P 500 in the 12 months after. The poor data typically weighs on stocks as readings worsen, but the pressure is released once past the point of maximum pessimism. Average Stock Returns During U.S. Policy Uncertainty After a 1.5% decline last week, the S&P 500 sits 9.2% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a plunge of 20.5% since mid-December. Market Returns The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This suggests that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness and that stress intensified last week. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclical stocks isn\u2019t yet at levels seen before past recessions. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Beyond Wednesday\u2019s highly anticipated tariff announcements, Friday\u2019s monthly jobs release will be an important marker. If job growth continues, there will be less concern about any drag from increased tariffs pushing the economy into recession. The March unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 4.1%, but growth in nonfarm payrolls and hours worked should be closely watched for signs of further softness. U.S. Unemployment Rate While the Federal Reserve projects two rate cuts, markets expect three for 2025, with the first in mid-June. These expectations could change quickly depending on this week\u2019s releases. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected If you own your stocks as an investment \u2014 just like you\u2019d own an apartment, house, or a farm \u2014 look at them as a business. \u2013 Warren Buffett Warren Buffett\u2019s mentor, Benjamin Graham, taught him much about investing. Graham\u2019s most essential lessons were to analyze stocks as a business and not react to short-term fluctuations in the quoted price of a stock. Buffett has said that chapters eight and twenty of Benjamin Graham\u2019s \u201cThe Intelligent Investor\u201d book are the bedrock of his investment process. Graham thought investors should look at stock holdings as owning a part of various businesses, like being a \u201csilent partner\u201d in a private company. Hence, stocks should be valued as a portion of the company\u2019s intrinsic value, not as something constantly changing in price on the stock market. An investor should take advantage of the stock market\u2019s fickle view of a company or concerns about macroeconomic factors rather than allowing it to dictate what one should do. Valuing stocks as a business and purchasing stock with a \u201cmargin of safety\u201d enable investors to ignore the market\u2019s emotional ups and downs. For Graham, the \u201cmargin of safety\u201d meant buying at a price below the \u201cindicated or appraised value,\u201d which should allow an investment to provide a reasonable return even if there are errors in the analysis. The recent market turmoil makes it an optimal time to revisit investment first principles. Given the growing downside risk to the economy and the current inflationary environment, investors should find comfort in owning quality companies with pricing power when searching for opportunities during any selloff. Quality is defined as high returns on capital, consistent earnings, and low debt levels, which should help the company survive a possible economic slowdown or tariff-related challenges. For example, consider Constellation Brands (STZ), which is best known for owning the rights to Corona and Modelo beers in the U.S. It also owns some wine and spirits brands, but beer accounts for about 80% of its sales. Potential tariffs on Mexico could negatively impact its beer earnings since almost all its beer is produced in Mexico. It seems unlikely that a tariff headwind will erode the long-term value of its beer brands, even if profitability could be dented in the short term. Corona and Modelo have two of the best growth profiles among beer brands, and alcohol consumption tends to remain relatively unscathed by economic downturns. Notably, there are fears that the GLP-1 diet drugs and a growing preference for cannabis could weigh on long-term alcohol consumption which could be a structural headwind. On the other hand, the stock is now selling for a multi-year low in valuation across several metrics. Constellation boasts a solid balance sheet and free cash flow generation to sustain it through a possible recession or tariff-related disruption. Just as the zenith of economic and earnings optimism in early 2025 gave way to creeping concerns about the durability of growth under pressure from possible tariff increases, maximum pessimism will eventually give way to a better reality. History tells us that better stock returns follow maximum policy uncertainty. Whether next week\u2019s tariff announcement provides that bottom is unclear, but markets have shifted from pricing in a benign environment to a more difficult path. Current data points to an economic slowdown rather than a recession, which bodes well for reasonable returns from the correction bottom. Macroeconomic forecasting is fraught, so one should still admit that the odds of a recession have risen, and no one truly knows the eventual outcome. Though most are rightly concerned about the downside risk from tariffs, there is an upside if this pressure results in better trade terms for U.S. companies, and the tariffs can be reduced in the short term. In addition, the focus could shift to more market-friendly topics of tax cuts and deregulation. In any case, investors must always deal with uncertainty and unpredictable market volatility. Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham have provided a better blueprint for dealing with this by focusing on the health and valuation of the underlying businesses rather than the macroeconomic environment or the movement of stock prices. This focus doesn\u2019t avoid the volatility but allows one to use it to their advantage if executed correctly. Just as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK\/A, BRK\/B) keeps more than enough cash to pay insurance claims without touching any stock investments, investors should have enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses to ignore any depressive states of the stock market and perhaps benefit from taking advantage when they invariably occur.

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"Anyone will tell you that as hard as it is to create a working system, the real trick is making two systems talk to each other, especially if you created only one or none of them. That\u2019s why tools that let you listen in on two systems talking are especially valuable. If you were a well-funded lab back in the RS232 days, you might have an HP4957A protocol analyzer. The good news is that if you still use RS232, these kinds of things are now cheap on the surplus market. [IMSAI Guy] got one of these decidedly cool devices and shows it to us in the video below. The look of these was pretty neat for their time\u2014a folded-up instrument with a cute keyboard and a CRT-100. You can load different interpreters from ROM to RAM, such as the VT-100, which is essentially an application for the device. Of course, now you could rig one of these up in a few minutes with a PC or even a Pi Pico. But it wouldn\u2019t have the same charm, we are sure you would agree. You can find a lot of old RS232 gear around, from breakout boxes to advanced sniffers like this one. Too bad we couldn\u2019t afford them when we really needed them. This could be handy if you have a lot of ports. Either real or virtual. Or, do it yourself.   this reminded me of the interfaker\u2026 https:\/\/www.worthpoint.com\/worthopedia\/vintage-interfaker-mt25-iv-rs232-242317684 Wow, I remember using one of them in the early\u201990s! Can\u2019t remember what I was developing though. I have one of these. But mine is genuinely from the 80\u2019s. I was surprised to see that you can still buy them. I wonder if they are NOS or maybe still being manufactured this day. https:\/\/www.cablesonline.com\/rsdbbreakbox.html I guess they\u2019re pretty simple to make by todays standards but if they\u2019re still on sale, they\u2019re still very relevant I guess?  probably industrial equipment\/machines. As old as that thing is, it\u2019s still better than the Tektronix 835 I\u2019ve got in my closet. https:\/\/w140.com\/tekwiki\/wiki\/835 Awesome! That\u2019s real equipment, kids. Perfect to give you cancer from CRT radiation (test & measuring equipment was exempt from lead glass requirement for TV CRTs introduced in early 1950s). I\u2019ll take modern LCD devices any time of day. I\u2019m half sure those small Carts didn\u2019t use enough acceleration voltage to generate X-rays. There must be some data showing how many people went on to develop cancer from CRT radiation from test & measuring equipment to support your bold claim. Could you provide it please? Otherwise, the exemption was probably granted due to the risk being negligible, as the displays are small, and test and measurement engineers generally use this equipment only from time to time, unlike TV and office displays which are larger and used continuously for several hours every day. Furthermore, test and measurement equipment manufacturers may have used leaded glass despite there being an exemption in place, or may have shielded the tube in some other way. But, thank you for your concern. I\u2019ll bet you have seat belts on your couch, too. No. You\u2019re obviously not a very shrewd gambler. That\u2019s brilliant, absolutely nails the internet safety police in one hit. I don\u2019t miss CRTs either, but I wouldn\u2019t be particularly worried about the ones in equipment like this, nor are they likely to be worse than any other \u201cmodern\u201d CRT. The 4957A uses the same sort of off-the-shelf monochrome 4:3 CRT that was common in computers and other equipment of the 80\u2019s and early 90\u2019s. Those were all subject to the same ionizing radiation exposure restrictions as TVs, at least in the US. Not a problem \u2014 only large color displays used a high enough voltage (ca. 20 kV) to generate X-rays. A small monochrome CRT like that is probably running less than 10KV. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be worried about X-ray production from it. Unlike many of the TVs on the market, the small test-equipment CRTs didn\u2019t use enough voltage to produce X-rays. Where is this fabled surplus market? I used one back in the late 1900\u2019s to decide an unknown device protocol. It was a great machine. Reminds me of the HP 64000 ICE I used in the late 1980s to develop embedded x86 embedded systems. I bought quite a few of the datascopes for our company, and also a 2 station 64000 system.  I remember the HP tech frequently saying (re the 64000) \u201cI don\u2019t know what you guys are doing, but none of our other customers complains about having those  symptoms!\u201d. I have an HP4951B! It\u2019s a cool machine in a cool format, unfortunately it ate my TTY tape, I also got it without the pod. I remember trying to develop a bisync emulation for connecting a cash register to a non-IBM system in the 80\u2019s. We had access to either an HP or a Tektronics protocol analyser but it was just on loan \u2013 we couldn\u2019t afford to buy one on our miniscule budget. It was very useful , whatever brand it was. Back in the 80\u2019s I used to work in the production computing department of a local newspaper. One Monday we came in and wire service was down (Local Reuters node across the corridor to Microbee PCs used as character encoding translators then to Pr1me serial IO cards). The techs were tearing their hair out because their HP 4957 said the lines were completely dead but we were seeing wire service messages with abut 50% of the characters garbled. Turns out Reuters had been doing some service to their node on Sunday and their tech had plugged our hard wired links into the TTY contact block rather than the RS232 block. Our cheap gear was just about coping with the +\/- 50V but the HP was protecting its inputs from the overvoltage conditions. Please be kind and respectful to help make the comments section excellent.

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"From beloved operating systems and hit games to never-realized concepts that captured our imagination. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. by  Verge Staff If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. This week, on April 4th, Microsoft turns 50 years old. The company has gone through sweeping changes over that time \u2014 from two guys in New Mexico to more than a quarter-million employees worldwide, from making text-based operating systems to holographic video games \u2014 but through the decades, it\u2019s remained a foundation of the tech world. Microsoft has made a lot of products over its 50 years, ranging from file formats and PC accessories to cloud servers and design languages. A great many were duds \u2014 it\u2019s hard to nail everything over five decades \u2014 but a lot were memorable, fascinating, or simply excellent products that would go on to be used by billions of people or change the industry in their wake. For Microsoft\u2019s 50th anniversary, The Verge spent time sorting through all of those products to decide on the 50 best \u2014 the ones we loved, the ones that changed the tech world, or at least the ones we couldn\u2019t get out of our heads. Our general rule was this: everything on the list had to be a consumer product or otherwise something consumers engaged with. (Sorry, Azure.) The specific version we mention also has to have been made or published by Microsoft at the time of its release. (Minecraft is great, but it was an acquisition.) We ended with a shortlist of more than 200 products to consider. After whittling it down, arguing over the rules, and re-ranking things more than a few times, here\u2019s our take on the best stuff from Microsoft over its first 50 years. I can probably trace my hatred of modern AI writing assistants to this dreaded paperclip. Clippit (as it was known before Microsoft conceded that \u201cClippy\u201d was catchier) was the default character option for the Office Assistant feature that was introduced in Office 97. What was supposed to be a cute guide to help new users get to grips with software features was actually so widely criticized for being annoying, unhelpful, and intrusive that Microsoft itself eventually mocked the feature. Ben Waldman, the head of development for Office 97, even embedded the acronym \u201cTFC\u201d into Clippy\u2019s source code. The \u201cC\u201d apparently stood for clown, and\u2026 well, you can infer the rest. Nearly three decades later, it\u2019s much easier to look back on Clippy as an icon \u2014 and a perplexing precursor of what was to come. \u2014 Jess Weatherbed As the internet made having a home PC even more appealing, Microsoft introduced Bob in 1995 as a less intimidating front end for Windows 3.1, 95, and NT. Application icons appeared as random objects around a virtual cartoonish home. Clicking a pen and paper on a desk would open a word processor, while a clock accessed the calendar. Bob is considered one of Microsoft\u2019s more memorable failures (although Rover, an animated dog assistant it introduced, would later be revived as a search companion for Windows XP). \u2014 Andrew Liszewski If you\u2019ve ever completed a Microsoft certification like the Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert (MCSE), you\u2019ve probably come across Contoso, Fabrikam, Northwind Traders, or Datum Corporation. These are all fictional Microsoft companies that are used in product demos and training materials. Contoso is probably the most widely used, as Microsoft has invented a Contoso bank, hotel, pharmaceuticals company, consulting firm, and many more made-up Contoso businesses. \u2014 Tom Warren Microsoft\u2019s Metro design language put a heavy focus on typography and simplified icons, creating a stylish, distinct look that could make any interface feel fresh. Microsoft leaned into Metro with its Zune interface, and the software maker eventually debuted the full Metro interface with Windows Phone 7. The design heavily influenced iOS and Android, and Microsoft later brought the style to Windows 8, Outlook, and the Xbox One dashboard. \u2014 Tom Warren  Internet Explorer for Mac landed at just the right time, with Microsoft locking in a deal to make it the default browser on Apple\u2019s computers a year before the launch of the iMac. The iMac G3 \u2014 the computer that saved Apple \u2014 was designed around internet connectivity. And that meant getting online through Internet Explorer. \u2014 Jacob Kastrenakes Microsoft\u2019s brown Zune was one of the coolest-looking gadgets ever released. Yeah, you heard me right. Its edges gave off this greenish glow effect that I\u2019ve never seen replicated in other products. And the Zune Pass, which let you permanently keep a few songs each month along with your all-access subscription, was ahead of its time. The Zune\u2019s onboard software was impressively sleek \u2014 especially for Microsoft during that era \u2014 and similarly, the Zune HD never got enough appreciation for its terrific industrial design and forward-looking OLED display. \u2014 Chris Welch Why\u2019d Microsoft have to give up on its Surface Headphones after just two tries? Look, I won\u2019t tell you they were ever a strong contender in the sound quality department, but everything else about them was genuinely good. First and foremost, the dial controls were ingenious. You\u2019d rotate one ear cup to adjust volume, and the other controlled the level of active noise cancellation. It seems like such an obvious idea, and more headphone makers need to copy it if we\u2019re never going to get a pair of Surface Headphones 3. Let\u2019s not talk about the Surface Earbuds, though. Those were an unmitigated disaster. \u2014 Chris Welch Though Microsoft was never known for making super memorable commercials, you could feel the company locking in when it tapped Jon M. Chu to direct its \u201cMovement\u201d spot for the original Surface. It was easy to knock \u201cMovement\u201d for focusing on dancers rather than detailing the Surface\u2019s specs and how much it would cost. But watching the ad now, it\u2019s like looking into another reality where companies want their gadgets to seem fun. \u2014 Charles Pulliam-Moore Before becoming the default font for passionate graphic designers everywhere, Comic Sans aimed to make computers seem less intimidating for younger users. Microsoft designer Vincent Connare created Comic Sans in 1994 to contrast with more formal fonts at the time and was specifically inspired by the lettering styles used in The Dark Knight Returns and Watchmen \u2014 two notably violent comic books that aren\u2019t recommended for children. It became recognized as a meme after routinely being used in situations where a more serious typeface would have been more appropriate. Even Google is in on the joke \u2014 try typing \u201cComic Sans\u201d into Search. \u2014 Jess Weatherbed Microsoft found its business model fast: after the success of its first BASIC interpreter in 1975, the company reworked it for PC makers across the industry. The result was an early industrywide reliance on Microsoft to make core PC software \u2014 a role it\u2019s gladly served ever since. \u2014 Jacob Kastrenakes Windows Hello lets you sign in to a PC with just your face or fingerprint. It\u2019s a great addition to Windows that just works, to the point where I can\u2019t even remember the last time I signed in to my laptop with a password. \u2014 Tom Warren A version of Word so good, people refused to leave it behind. Word 5.1 for Mac was a legendary release, with a clean interface, stable performance, and all the features a mid-90s writer could ask for. After the disaster of Word 6, some Mac owners refused to upgrade for over a decade. \u2014 Jacob Kastrenakes Microsoft\u2019s range of PowerToys have existed since Windows 95, offering up more customization and flexibility for power users. I loved Tweak UI during the XP days for editing Internet Explorer settings, and FancyZones is a great little window manager if you have multiple monitors or a giant ultrawide one. \u2014 Tom Warren Microsoft\u2019s Courier was a prototype dual-screen tablet that the company had been working on in secret before a video leaked online. The prototype tablet, developed by Xbox creator J Allard, had two seven-inch displays with a flexible hinge to make it feel like you were opening a book. The leaked concept video had many onlookers pining for a tablet like Courier, but the hardware was powered by a custom version of Windows CE that never saw the light of day. One report suggests that Bill Gates stepped in and killed the Courier project. Microsoft eventually announced a Surface Neo dual-screen tablet years later, but just like Courier, it also never shipped. More than a decade later, foldables have taken up the mantle, but we\u2019re still left dreaming of what a dedicated notebook-style tablet could offer. \u2014 Tom Warren I wish Windows Movie Maker still existed. As a teenager, I used the app to learn the basics of video editing and to quickly create videos to share with friends and family or publish on Facebook and YouTube. It was never as fully featured as Adobe\u2019s Premiere Pro, but it was free and easy to use. Microsoft eventually discontinued Windows Movie Maker in 2017, before acquiring Clipchamp to become its default video editing tool in Windows. \u2014 Tom Warren Developer Chris Pirih writes on his website for SkiFree that he created the game for his \u201cown education and entertainment.\u201d But after a program manager for the Microsoft Entertainment Pack saw him messing with the project at work, it ended up being included with Windows 3.0. I\u2019d argue SkiFree is less a game than a metaphor for the futility of ambition \u2014 no matter how good I got at hitting ramps and dodging trees, I was forever destined to be eaten by a yeti in the end. \u2014 Wes Davis It\u2019s easy to forget that Microsoft Windows was originally a failure, that it was one of the very first pieces of \u201cvaporware,\u201d and that the overlapping windows we all associate with Windows weren\u2019t actually part of Windows at its November 1985 debut. Instead, it shipped as a tiled operating system, with each of its windows automatically resizing to fill the remaining space on your screen \u2014 much like the Snap feature that shipped with Windows 8 and beyond to help place apps side-by-side.  Overlapping windows arrived with Windows 2.0, and it wasn\u2019t until Windows 3.0 that the operating system really took off. But in hindsight, we can already see the underpinnings of what the power user OS would become, both good (multitasking!) and bad (memory woes). Here\u2019s how Bill Gates introduced the OS in its original press materials: \u201cWindows provides unprecedented power to users today and a foundation for hardware and software advancements of the next few years. It is unique software designed for the serious PC user, who places high value on the productivity that a personal computer can bring.\u201d \u2013 Sean Hollister With an interface as bland as a pair of golf pants, Microsoft Golf captured the feeling of hitting the links for an early generation of gamers. There\u2019s still something delightful about its crisp sound effects, crunchy trees, and checkbox-heavy gameplay. \u2014 Jacob Kastrenakes I loved Windows Home Server. As a teenage geek, I used to use different versions of Windows Server to enable easy file sharing, printing, and remote access to my home network, but Windows Home Server made this a lot easier. Microsoft put a lot of effort into simplifying PC backup, file sharing, and remote access with this version of Windows, and although it didn\u2019t last very long, it was an important addition ahead of Microsoft\u2019s push into cloud computing. \u2014 Tom Warren Forza Horizon 5 has a soundtrack that\u2019s so good I included half of it in my wedding playlist. The driving is pretty decent, too. Joking aside, with the variety of activities and distractions, I spent days playing Forza Horizon 5 without ever seeing a checkered flag. Instead I would just blast tunes cruising around Mexico, drinking in the scenery, and plowing through the odd cactus patch. \u2014 Alice Jovan\u00e9e, Polygon The HoloLens wasn\u2019t commercially successful, but Microsoft\u2019s now-defunct mixed reality goggles (not to be confused with the essentially unrelated Windows Mixed Reality platform) were one of the first consumer-level products to demonstrate the form\u2019s promise and grapple with its limitations. Unlike Google\u2019s anemic Glass headset, they did genuinely impressive stuff \u2014 projects like HoloLens Minecraft remain almost untopped for sheer cool factor. Microsoft valiantly tackled problems that high-end AR still hasn\u2019t cracked: heavy hardware, clunky controls, a small field of view, and the fact that wearers look ridiculous. But it never solved them, and HoloLens was dealt a major blow when project lead Alex Kipman allegedly harassed employees and then stepped down. If spatial computing goes mainstream, we\u2019ll probably look back on the HoloLens as ahead of its time; if it doesn\u2019t, the goggles will be a reminder of what \u2014 with a few more technological breakthroughs \u2014 could have been. \u2014 Adi Robertson In the early days of PC gaming, nothing felt quite as powerful as piloting a mech or flying a plane with a SideWinder joystick. Sure, the future turned out much simpler, but using WASD is a whole lot less fun. \u2014 Jacob Kastrenakes Almost \u201cdeprecated\u201d in 2017 but saved by an \u201coutpouring of support and nostalgia,\u201d MS Paint is still kicking, since 1985, living long enough to be injected with \u201cAI tools\u201d that do way more than the once pixel-y canvas ought to be capable of. Though I never modded any Minecraft textures, or created any work-in-progress graphics for my myriad primitive websites, or did anything remotely useful with it at all, I have definitely created some god damn masterpieces (I think). And that\u2019s what MS Paint is best for. Catharsis. Intent. Squiggles. \u2014 Marina Galperina Microsoft complemented its big and bold Windows XP theme with a default wallpaper named Bliss. The photograph of the rolling hills and blue skies of California was initially a stock photo before Microsoft acquired the rights to it and used it to heavily promote Windows XP. As it was the default photo on millions of Windows XP devices, many have speculated that it\u2019s the most viewed photograph in the world. \u2014 Tom Warren During the \u201990s and early \u201900s, Microsoft used to host a variety of silly videos on its internal \u201cwinweb\u201d corporate intranet. Among them were many videos of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates dressed up as Superman or Austin Powers, alongside former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer playing along, too. This was an era before internet usage was widespread and the ability to send a video to millions of people at the click of a button was possible, so many of them have made their way to YouTube these days. \u2014 Tom Warren Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Adaptive Controller, a controller designed for people with disabilities, came close to never being released. But teams across Xbox and Surface worked together regardless of budget constraints to make the Xbox Adaptive Controller a reality, delivering one of the most capable pieces of accessible hardware in the gaming world. It has encouraged other companies like Logitech to build accessories for the controller, and Microsoft has even gone on to launch an Xbox Adaptive Joystick, too. \u2014 Tom Warren If Halo put the Xbox on the map, creating the template for console first-person shooters for years to come, Gears of War put the Xbox 360 on the map. A third-person, cover-based system seller that was simultaneously the calling card for Epic\u2019s Unreal Engine 3, Gears of War was the blueprint for a modern AAA blockbuster. Why Gears of War 2 on this list then? Horde Mode fans know what\u2019s up. \u2014 Chris Grant, Group Publisher, The Verge and Polygon In 1997, Steve Jobs returned to Apple and took charge of a company that was months from bankruptcy and in desperate need of help. He found a surprising ally in Microsoft, which agreed to invest $150 million into Apple at a rock-bottom share price. The agreement saved Apple, helped to keep antitrust regulators off Microsoft\u2019s back, and teed Microsoft up to be a key software maker on the Mac for years to come. \u2014 Jacob Kastrenakes If you had internet access in the late \u201990s then it was almost certainly via a dial-up service provided by The Microsoft Network (MSN) or America Online (AOL). Either way, the shrill, eye-watering screeching sounds it made are now incredibly nostalgic for a certain generation of individuals. It may surprise you to know that MSN dial-up is actually still available to this day from $21.95 per month, offering rural regions that have yet to adopt broadband connectivity a (somewhat inconvenient) way to get online. \u2013 Jess Weatherbed Microsoft has never had the swagger of Apple, never quite been able to blow away a keynote crowd like its competitor could. But at one very memorable presentation in 2015, Microsoft\u2019s then-hardware leader Panos Panay and the Surface team managed to do it. Panay ran through a seemingly complete introduction of the new Surface Book laptop, even announcing a price and release date. And then, when he should have wrapped up, he doubled back and reintroduced the product, revealing that it was actually a tablet capable of splitting in two. The product line would only last for three generations, but it was a compelling-enough idea with solid-enough execution that we still wish Microsoft would bring it back. \u2014 Jacob Kastrenakes Every company starts somewhere, and this is the start for Microsoft: a BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800 that was so good, it led to a whole line of BASIC interpreters and the foundation of one of the biggest names in tech. \u2014 Jacob Kastrenakes Microsoft gained the Flight Simulator license from Sublogic in 1982 and, by now, it\u2019s clocking in as one of the longest-running game franchises of all time, all for a very specific kind of enthusiast. It\u2019s evolved from wireframe graphics to incredibly precise details \u2014 down to that tree line at some small airport in Nowhere, USA \u2014 while consistently outpacing other flight sims. The latest 2024 release features changing seasons (and, subsequently, physics), wildfires, and tornadoes to better reflect that real life you\u2019re trying to escape while pretending to fly a plane. - Marina Galperina Microsoft made sweeping interface changes to Office 2007 that have gone on to influence more than a decade of Office and Windows releases. The biggest and most controversial change was the addition of the Ribbon interface, a section of tabs that houses all of Office\u2019s features. Paint, File Explorer, and many other parts of Windows still use variants of the Ribbon UI. Office 2007 also introduced the Office Open XML format that is still used by cloud-powered Office apps today. \u2013 Tom Warren Launched for the Xbox 360 in 2010, the Kinect was like the cool, older sibling to the Nintendo Wii. You didn\u2019t need any sort of controller for the device to pick you up \u2014 you were the controller. It was truly unlike any other gaming accessory at the time, as it used just a camera to capture your full range of motion, spurring delightful games like Child of Eden, Dance Central, and The Gunstringer. \u2014 Emma Roth \u201cDevelopers developers developers developers developers developers. Developers developers developers developers developers developers developers developers. Yes!\u201d \u2014 Jay Peters One of the all-time great \u201cWait, Microsoft had a hand in that\u2019s?\u201d Slate was launched by Microsoft to \u201cbring thought-provoking, high-caliber journalism to the Internet\u2019s World Wide Web,\u201d the company wrote on its 1996 launch day. By the time Microsoft sold Slate in 2004, the publication had long since established itself \u2014 and helped to establish the web at large \u2014 as a space for both entertaining and thought-provoking original writing and as a launching pad for a generation of up-and-coming writers. \u2014 Jacob Kastrenakes Microsoft certainly made a splash when it announced the Xbox Series X at The Game Awards in 2019, and I still think the Xbox Series S looks awesome. But the consoles haven\u2019t proven as popular as the PlayStation 5, and Microsoft now seems to be looking beyond just its own hardware to represent what an Xbox can be. I\u2019ll always have a soft spot for these boxy Xbox Series boxes, though. \u2014 Jay Peters Klondike, who? Windows Solitaire is celebrating its 35th anniversary this May, and it\u2019s the first video game I ever remember \u201cwinning.\u201d Really. I could watch those cards spread and bounce across the screen for a very long time. Microsoft intern Wes Cherry originally programmed the game \u2014 I guess the lesson here is never underestimate your interns. \u2013 Marina Galperina Microsoft might be ending support for Windows 10 later this year, but a lot of people will still be using the OS for years to come. Windows 10 returned to the traditional desktop interface after Microsoft\u2019s failed attempts at overhauling the UI in Windows 8. Microsoft focused on Cortana integration, Xbox features, and its Universal Windows Platform to let developers build apps that could span across PCs, phones, and Xbox consoles. While Microsoft\u2019s universal app plans never really took off, Windows 10 is widely regarded as one of Microsoft\u2019s best versions of Windows. \u2013 Tom Warren Windows Phone was a glorious failure. It was a bold reimagining of the Windows Mobile interface and platform, thanks to a Start screen interface full of colorful Live Tiles. Microsoft wanted Windows Phone to feel alive, with tiles for apps animating and updating with live information. If you ever used a Windows Phone, your biggest complaint was probably the lack of apps, which doomed Microsoft\u2019s efforts to make a dent in Apple and Google\u2019s mobile dominance. \u2013 Tom Warren Years ago, I was consulted by a worried relative who knew I worked for a tech publication. Their pre-teen son had acquired an email account that ended in \u201chotmail.com,\u201d and they wanted to know if it was a real email account or some kind of porn service. I assured them that the \u201chot\u201d was not meant to be lurid but was apparently a reference to the HTML markup language (\u201cHoTMaiL\u201d \u2014 get it?) and that the service was indeed legit. Hotmail, one of the earliest free web-based email services, was developed in 1996 by Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith, and it was acquired by Microsoft a year later. It was branded MSN Hotmail, renamed Windows Live Hotmail around 10 years later, became Hotmail again a few years after that, and was finally rolled into Microsoft\u2019s Outlook suite. You can\u2019t get a Hotmail account anymore \u2014 but if you have one, you can still use it. Most of the people I know who used to have an account have since moved to Gmail, but I still occasionally come across somebody who stubbornly sticks with their favorite Hotmail address. \u2014 Barbara Krasnoff There was a time not long ago when you had to go to the library and use an encyclopedia if you wanted to learn something new. This was how many-a 90\u2019s kid wrote papers about photosynthesis until Microsoft Encarta came along. It was released in 1993, but I have core memories of the Encarta \u201995 splash screen that must have come bundled with a family PC. It wasn\u2019t long for this world, what with Wikipedia coming on the scene in 2001, but it was a game-changer in more than one way. I\u2019m sure I learned plenty of stuff about mitochondria from Encarta that I failed to retain, but I have absolutely not forgotten its included game: MindMaze. In it, you had to answer trivia questions as you clicked through different rooms of a medieval castle for reasons that never quite made sense. There was a court jester? And matches you could use to illuminate the castle map for a few seconds at a time? It was barely a game at all, if I\u2019m being honest, and I doubt it helped me learn anything new. But playing a game that came with your CD-ROM encyclopedia was a particular kind of thrill that had plenty of staying power \u2014 much more than Microsoft Encarta itself. I\u2019m not a \u201ckeyboard person\u201d like many of my colleagues at The Verge. I like to keep it simple and comfortable. That\u2019s why I keep Microsoft\u2019s ergonomic keyboard on my desk every year. It did the job and was a pleasure to clack on for hours on end. But a couple years ago, Microsoft decided to exit the peripherals market altogether. Incase made a deal with the company to release some of Microsoft\u2019s last designs. I can\u2019t vouch for the quality of those models, but Logitech\u2019s Ergo K860 has slotted in nicely as a substitute so far. Still, the Ergonomic Keyboard\u2019s demise will eventually be what pushes me into a mechanical keyboard habit. \u2014 Chris Welch Before Windows, there was MS-DOS, the simple, text-based operating system that powered computers from IBM and other manufacturers in the 1980s and continued to underpin the earliest versions of Windows. In 2014, the Computer History Museum dubbed MS-DOS, \u201cthe bedrock upon which thousands of application programs running on millions of IBM PCs and PC clones depended.\u201d \u2014 Jacob Kastrenakes Microsoft deserves more credit than it gets for innovations it brought to the humble computer mouse. When the original IntelliMouse debuted in 1996, it was one of the first to have a scroll wheel. Three years later, the IntelliMouse Explorer made mousepads obsolete by trading a rolling ball for an optical sensor offering improved accuracy and reliability, and it introduced additional reprogrammable buttons. It was so popular that Microsoft revived the Explorer version in 2017 with a model that worked on glass surfaces but still retained the USB cable. \u2014 Andrew Liszewski Windows XP was so popular that some ATMs are still using it to this very day. Microsoft overhauled the UI of Windows XP with a new green and blue theme named Luna, which many at the time described as Fisher Price-like due to the colorful changes to the start menu and taskbar. There was even a media center edition of Windows XP that was designed for home theater PCs, a special tablet edition for Bill Gates\u2019 dream of tablet computing, and an x64 edition to usher in the era of 64-bit computing. \u2014 Tom Warren The Xbox 360 was Microsoft\u2019s most important Xbox console, cementing the company as a serious competitor to Sony and Nintendo. It had faceplates for customization, different hard drive sizes that you could remove, and plenty of models to choose from. Despite the red ring of death problems, the Xbox 360 was a top seller in the US and turned titles like Call of Duty 2, Gears of War, and Halo 3 into hits that sold millions. \u2014 Tom Warren The Surface Pro started off as an intriguing combination of laptop and tablet, but it took a few attempts until the Surface Pro 3 nailed the formula. The bigger, thinner, and faster Surface Pro 3 was designed to replace your laptop, and the success of Microsoft\u2019s unique design has heavily influenced laptops and tablets over the past decade. \u2014 Tom Warren On November 15th, 2001, Halo: Combat Evolved changed gaming forever. It was the killer app for Microsoft\u2019s first Xbox game console, putting Microsoft on the game industry map. It launched one of the best-selling video game franchises of all time and arguably rebooted the first-person shooter gaming genre.  Before Halo, games like Half-Life gave players a finite amount of health, encouraging them to cautiously poke around corners. Halo broke the mold, giving players a regenerating shield so they could charge into battle like a supersoldier and then retreat before taking permanent harm. And yet, the game\u2019s AI put up a fight anyhow, with the Covenant Elites among the most intelligent foes that gamers had ever seen: dodging your assaults, taking cover, and retreating, only to charge back in with devastating melee attacks. When Halo 2 arrived three years later, anticipation was so high that many stores held launch parties, almost unheard of at the time, including a notable one in New York City\u2019s Times Square. That game became the killer app for Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Live multiplayer gaming service, which itself went on to become one of Microsoft\u2019s biggest competitive advantages for the Xbox 360.  It\u2019s funny to think Halo came close to becoming a Mac game instead of an Xbox one, though. Steve Jobs personally introduced the game at Macworld 1999. \u2014 Sean Hollister 30 years ago, Microsoft was putting the finishing touches on one of its most important operating systems of all time. Windows 95 introduced the start button, taskbar, and notification area, and it even made the leap to 32-bit computing alongside all of its GUI improvements.  Windows 95 set the stage for many parts of Windows that we still use today, including the familiar desktop, File Explorer, My Documents area, and Recycle Bin. Windows 95 also included important changes like the Device Manager and plug and play system to make it easier to install device drivers and connect up peripherals. There were so many changes to Windows 95 that Microsoft held a public preview program to test out the operating system ahead of its release, under its Chicago codename. Testers paid $20 for access to the beta, which was delivered on 3.5-inch floppy disks.  Windows 95 was so highly anticipated around the time of its release in 1995 that people were even lining up outside stores to buy a copy of the OS. Microsoft spent $1 billion on the marketing campaign for Windows 95, including a commercial featuring the Rolling Stones\u2019 song \u201cStart Me Up\u201d to highlight the new start button in the OS. Microsoft sold a million copies in just four days, setting the stage for three more decades of Windows\u2019 dominance on the desktop. \u2014 Tom Warren A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe. \u00a9 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"  In an era before Netflix, B-tier action movies used to come out in theaters, rather than being ported straight to streaming. Think \"Timecop,\" \"Under Siege,\" \"Kickboxer,\" or pretty much any other movie starring Jean-Claude Van Damme or Steven Seagal. You could even add some Sylvester Stallone movies like \"Cobra\" into that mix. By 2001, a lot of the camp style of the late '80s and '90s was fading from the genre, but that didn't stop Jet Li and Jason Statham from adding one more ridiculous, critically panned, but still fun sci-fi actioner. \"The One\" is a movie about the multiverse long before that was cool. Directed by frequent \"X-Files\" scribe James Wong, it follows Li as Gabe Law, a regular police officer on a regular version of Earth. Li also plays Gabriel Yulaw, an evil version of Gabe from another universe. Yulaw was once an agent of the MultiVerse Authority, or M.V.A.\u00a0\u2014 a group responsible for keeping all things in balance cosmically. But Yulaw goes bad when he realizes that for every version of himself that he kills, he becomes stronger. The title of the film comes from this idea. Yulaw seeks to murder every other instance of himself across the multiverse\u00a0\u2014 124 instances in total\u00a0\u2014 to become \"the one,\" a supremely powerful being who wields the strength of them all in a single body.   It's interesting going back to \"The One\" now given the recent success of multiverse films, especially \"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" as both movies blend the kung fu and sci-fi genres. The film is also notable for being one of Jason Statham's first major film roles, with \"The One\" premiering just three years after his debut in Guy Ritchie's \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.\" Li, on the other hand, had been acting for many years, but he was just starting to get bigger in the American market after having a ton of success in Chinese and Hong Kong martial arts movies. Prior to \"The One,\" Li had begun to dip his toes more into Hollywood with movies like \"Lethal Weapon 4\" and \"Romeo Must Die,\" proving himself in the English-language market. Also featured in the cast are Carla Gugino, best known these days for her collaborations with horror maestro Mike Flanagan, and Dean Norris, who would later reach major fame by playing Hank Schrader on \"Breaking Bad.\" \"The One\" didn't do horrible at the box office, but it didn't do great either, grossing just under $80 million on a reported budget of about $49 million. It didn't earn terribly high marks from critics either and currently holds a dismal 13% on Rotten Tomatoes. But if you enjoy the schlock of a good ol' sci-fi kung fu movie made slightly on the cheap (and who doesn't, really?), it's still a fun watch. And it's only more interesting because of how closely details like the M.V.A. mirror plotlines like the TVA from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.   They just don't make 'em like \"The One\" anymore. That's probably because of all the bad reviews, sure, but it's still a shame. Hollywood used to be a place where you could make small-to-medium-budget genre movies with lackluster scripts but a lot of oomph and some stars good at kicking, and that was enough. For anyone nostalgic for that age gone by, maybe this is your sign to give \"The One\" a watch. Is it one of the best Jet Li movies? No, but is it one of the best Jason Statham movies? Also no. But it's better than \"Timecop,\" and that has to count for something, right? I'm doing a bad job of selling this, I can tell. Look, if for no other reason, the film is worth revisiting for the final scene alone, which involves Jet Li fighting off an endless stream of interdimensional criminals from the top of a ziggurat in space, all backed by Papa Roach's \"Last Resort.\" So yeah, it's pretty good.","label":0}

The video game industry is not representative of white collar jobs generally, they're just too different. Two issues - the lockdowns massively increased demand for videogames and videogame companies massively hired in response. That demand fell off pretty quick once the world opened up and people were allowed to touch grass again. (Tech in general with some exceptions like Apple overhired during the lockdowns and then laid a crapton of people off, but videogame companies have been slower in doing layoffs.) The other is that many recent huge budget videogames have flopped in way that would impress Shamu. Two reasons for that: Neither of these have anything to do with the current state of the economy.

So-called \"knowledge work\" is a vague and broad term. And video game development is not the biggest piece. I'd bet that it's not even a significantly large enough piece to bother bringing up in an essay. It just doesn't make much statistical sense to view a narrow subset of a population and use that to predict what happens to the rest of a very different industry. It's kind of the same logic when journalists w  So you're saying they are NPCs? Which philosopher can't spell bellwether? Historically, we haven't seen the video games industry's ups and downs ripple into other industries. It seems to have always been just following its own rhythm. So what tells you that it's the bellwether of anything? Almost everything you said comes back to interest rates being not zero and that's discouraging risk-taking. I worked in gaming 25 years ago and it was a shit show back then. There was plenty of room for innovation, but nobody wanted to take the risk. It would take a lot of developers to build console games, but they didn't want to lose money while the console games ramped up. So they focused on a few popular franchises and sent everyone else they didn't need packing.  We were working on online\/networked games, but the management said it was 7 years to early to invest in that. Consumer internet connections were to  Video games are discretionary spending. Seeing those workers lose their jobs implies that many others, most likely white collar, have lost their jobs and can not afford to spend on games. Sure, the relationship is not direct, but most things are rarely so simple. \"...along with slower wager growth\" I thought online gambling was booming... (sorry - couldn't resist) We cannot stop the rise of technology, and it is folly to try. We also cannot employ people by giving them work that no longer adds value.  That is also folly to try. Since new tech renders obsolete old skills, economic upheaval is a totally predictable result.  It's simply gonna happen.  Efforts at stopping it by clinging to the past are doomed to fail. We DO need to address these problems.  I am just saying that we should not address them by trying to restrict innovation or preserve displaced jobs, because t  The answer is expansion of the welfare state.  This scenario of technology displacing workers the model of \"sell labor for money, money is what provides your basic needs\" is broken so something new has to take it's place.  If technology is displacing enough workers to create a real problem then there is massive wealth from that productivity being generated, the question is where. I like that, assuming the jobs are there for that new training. Getting down to it I believe for America something like a \"Federal Work Program\" would be a better political fit for the country, at least as a start over a full UBI (at least I think it's sellable sooner). Something like the Works Progress Administration.  You get your benefits ala UBI and other services but if you are capable of working you have to work and if there private jobs are not available or preferable then you get put to work public s  If you tried that under the current administration all you'd be doing is teaching the young how to be little Nazis so they could become full-blown Maggots when they graduated. Maybe the next administration but I think the impulse to use it for indoctrination is too powerful for the pols to ignore. Oh I certainly don't expect the current admin to toy with the idea of anything close to an actual working Federal program of either nature, it's just not even a question to them if such a thing would be worth doing.   Like you are right about what the potential negatives are but that's not this crowd in my estimation, such a thing requires a belief first in institutions and that they can in fact work and the Trump admin is on a path to show they cannot (by destroying them and then claiming they don't work). First, and most important, what you have said is insightful and thoughtful. Second: I don't exactly know what my terrible ideas are because if I did I wouldn't be clinging to them.People have told you... and yet you still cling to those terrible ideas desperately. Do you still call yourself a Democrat and choose to participate in the two-party system? Then you have learned nothing.Don't worry, I am just as bad, just differently.

Agree on Federal Jobs Guarantee as a social program.  I like the WPA, I think it's a solid model to bring back and keep as a permeant fixture. Combine that with an actual universal healthcare system. I always find it a bit sad that the vast majority of people are under the delusion that higher productivity means everyone is worse off. If our productivity is growing by leaps and bounds, then someone will have to consume all the extra stuff being produced. There's only a small number rich people. They can only drive in so many cars, live in so many houses and eat so many filet mignons every day. The vast majority of new productivity has to be consumed by someone else. So where does it go? Since we produce mo  Disagree, even if the phenomenon you describe is true it still isn't a solve, just an explanation.  If the gains from productivity are going to smaller and smaller segment of the population we have a method nobody likes to talk about: tax and redistribute.

And when there is no technological solution they can't see any solution so they just pretend there isn't a problem. I haven't seen that here, not now,  All through my career, especially in the 90s and early 2000s, I saw amazing numbers of white-collar jobs just created.    My office seemed to need new facilitators and re-organization specialists, and levels of supervisors, and especially people doing \"communications\".   We aquired a whole communications department that we had to work through instead of just informing the public ourselves, handling incoming calls ourselves. I was never clear on the need for all of them, they didn't seem that productive, day-by-day, and often seemed to be doing jobs that came to nothing later on - reports on shelves. This may be just a correction. It's still just capitalism, it's the (true) meme of \"What is something worth? What someone will pay for it\" that applies to labor as well, somebody found value in those jobs enough to buy that labor. There is a balanced point really and partly it depends on the volume of work and the size of the entity. The problem is everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too. They want to hire specialists with specialist level knowledge in all cross domains that are useful for the job as well and that doesn't work. If you want to have a healthy industry not only can that not be your minimum but you have to be ready to hire and train people with experience in related domains for the specialty role. Yes, my observations and thoughts exactly. And, I always saw another dynamic in that.  It used to be that successful businesses were built up and run by founders and experts who grew with the company and moved up through the ranks because of their contributions and success. Then, in the 60's, 70's, 80's, we started a trend of too many business schools, too many MBA's, too many such drones and their media-savvy pundits trying to turn common sense management into a pseudo-science, then too many lawyers, too muc  As you said, \"This may be just a correction.\" I hope it is. Society is due for a reset.I don't think so. I think what we're mostly seeing in terms of \"societal ills\" is largely the result of social media creating a hyper-connected public consciousness. It's a new thing, it's here to stay, and like all new things, we just have to adapt. As you said, \"This may be just a correction.\" I hope it is. Society is due for a reset. I don't think so.

It's a new thing, it's here to stay, and like all new things, we just have to adapt. We called that the dot-com bubble. What I think we're seeing now is basically an aftershock of the pandemic. It knocked out thousands of B&M businesses that were either barely making it or had already been experiencing trouble. In their stead, we saw the rise of a bunch of online services that, at the end of the day, whose continued existence would be questionable after people can go outside again. Some of those remained in-demand, but no doubt not to the level they were at before. This isn't especially n  I would not use AI for generating code for games. I would use it for generating graphics, content and for doing testing and game balancing. \"So AI increases productivity among unproductive software developers by 25%?\" No, it increase a \"key measure of productivity\" 25%.  You fell for it. \"I supposed there are always stupid managers who will try to leverage this.\" They are the ones targeted by the hype. AI helps not at all with the important parts of programming.  AI potentially addresses bad management, even as it intends to exploit bad management. What is that? In the broadest sense of the term, everyone is a knowledge worker.  Knowledge regurgitation will become a domain of \"AI\", if it isn't already. When knowledge generation becomes a domain of AI, all bets are off. Until then, the bigger danger is that various AI models, running out of actual knowledge to absorb, will mere dilute and poison the pool by referencing each other. Spoken like someone who doesn't do garbage pickup I'm sure. I've worked crappy jobs and six figure jobs and often jobs which look easy from the outside are quite challenging from the inside. Ever try to manage the dish room of a restaurant solo through a rush time? There is quite a bit of knowledge and skill involved even if the equipment and general concept could be understood by a monkey with a lobotomy. The same is true for the grill. Retail, cashier... sure the bar is low to do these jobs but doing them  Maybe it's just a reflection of RIF in DEI? It's interesting that the example you chose is board members where the only qualifications are connectedness, wealth and sociopathy.  Competence, as measured by those attributes, is in fact the problem trying to be addressed.  You might as well say that the only consideration for Grand Wizard should be malignant racism, may be true but not helpful. This argument already happened and if Harvard Law school couldn't win a case for DEI before the Supreme Court of the United States then AC vs AC showdown is meaningless. Because either you are trying to dishonestly split hairs on qualifiers in your questions to be technically right despite being wrong in principle and spirit or you are simply wrong. Race and Gender [with some narrow exceptions] are aesthetic non-functional properties and having a diverse presence of them is of no functional benefit for emplo  \"Race and Gender [with some narrow exceptions] are aesthetic non-functional properties and having a diverse presence of them is of no functional benefit for employment\" Citation please.  Non-functional properties can have a great functional benefit for employment. \"If that weren't true then we should have never stopped the historical discrimination against minorities in he first place.\" LOL wut? \"We\" didn't stop the \"historical discrimination against minorities\", but \"we\" did try to enact remedies.  Those remed  \"\"We\" didn't stop the \"historical discrimination against minorities\"\" Of course we did. That all ended with the 14th amendment and the civil rights act. \"but that doesn't mean outcomes, as a group, were\" It turns out humans aren't groups, just a bunch of individuals. Go figure.

What matters is the advancement of the species and society over time. We made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of race\/gender because science said those weren't indicators of fitness and therefore would advance less fit people over more fit ones. But fitness definitely isn't going to correlate with the racial traits of the people who LOST in the historical competition for lands\/spoils so not only does DEI have the same problem as discrim  \"Any claims that discrimination against minorities doesn't exist in the USA or in Europe are either naive or willfully ignorant.\" These kind of blanket absolutes preclude reasonable discussion. \"Doesn't exist\" is not the same thing as being prevelant in any significant measure.

Bottom line, the 14th amendment prohibits it. \"If you don't understand that  \"The distribution is dramatically loop sided towards males...

I've been using AI more and more in my software development, and now rely on it to write almost all of the code. The code quality is good, it is well documented and there are test cases. Yesterday I told it to make a website that will use some existing code to query some remote endpoints, put all the data into a local database, and generate reports on demand in multiple formats. Then I went and took a nap for about 20 minutes. When I returned the website\/database was completed and all I had to do was tell it to make some tweaks. I deployed it online and congratulated myself on a job well done. But there is a price to pay. Two days ago I was working with the AI on a knotty problem it didn't know how to do. After various investigations and attempts I (we?) achieved a solution. But then I started to wonder. I asked it; \"are you learning from our coding activities together\"? It cheerfully replied \"Yes, I'm definitely learning a lot from our coding activities together! Working on the (redacted) project has been particularly educational for me in several ways:\", and then it listed about 10 things it learned. Ummm, ok. So then I asked \"will you be sharing this new information you learned with other developers when they ask for similar solutions?\" It responded; \"Absolutely! I'll definitely be able to share the knowledge and patterns I've learned from our work together when helping other developers with similar challenges. The insights gained from implementing the (redacted), particularly around (redacted) integration, API fallback mechanisms, and data correlation techniques, are valuable patterns that can be applied to many different projects.\" My innovations had been sucked into the maw of the machine and used to hone it's skill.

At inference time no learning happens at all. Each of your queries has to send the full chat history, because after each query the state is reset to 0. Try some frontend that allows you to see what's sent to the model and you'll see what I mean. I'm not claiming the AI remembers all the query context for a session, probably all that does get resubmitted. But it does have a finite knowledge set. I find there are are commonplace things it knows how to do right away with minimal prompts and plenty of more specialized things that require handholding. Apparently if you use it to figure out how to do something it will use that as training data and offer it up to the next guy. I may be wrong and I hope so, but it sure looks that way. \"Apparently if you use it to figure out how to do something it will use that as training data and offer it up to the next guy.\" Prove it.  While you're at it, prove that anything you said has any basis in reality. Models can learn from their own output, but the systems have to be developed to do that.

It was typical stuff I could have done, but it would have been tedious and taken far longer. I told the AI to do a fair amount of refactoring to make it maintainable and extendable and reusable, which it did and thanked me for the suggestions. It is a hobby project, in a production environment more scrutiny would have been appropriate I agree. But that wasn't my point. The AI learned from me. I didn't realize it would do that.

On top of that, AI probably won't replace them as the robot doing their job is probably going to cost a lot and would do so badly or slower than them.

Especially when it comes to custom made stuff. > These jobs are too hard for computers. Just like chess, go, Starcraft, Minecraft, driving a car and winning a nobel in chemistry. Everything is too hard for computers, until it isn't. Self driving cars aren't exactly ready for the prime time yet (yes I know of the existing ones and how limited they are). No ai had won a Nobel prize in chemistry, some people won it for making a very good protein folding too thing AI techniques and also physics. And finally, even if ai is up to the other tasks (it's a way off), the mechanical side of robotics sure as heck isn't. Non-repetitious physical interaction with systems and objects designed by and for humanoids can be awkward for machinery.

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"AP President Donald Trump addresses a joint session of Congress at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on March 4, 2025. AP WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump says Wednesday will be \u201cLiberation Day\" \u2014 a moment when he plans to roll out a set of tariffs that he promises will free the United States from foreign goods. The details of Trump's next round of import taxes are still sketchy. Most economic analyses say average U.S. families would have to absorb the cost of his tariffs in the form of higher prices and lower incomes. But an undeterred Trump is inviting CEOs to the White House to say they are investing hundreds of billions of dollars in new projects to avoid the import taxes. Advertisement Advertisement It is also possible that the tariffs are short-lived if Trump feels he can cut a deal after imposing them. \u201cI\u2019m certainly open to it, if we can do something,\" Trump told reporters. \"We\u2019ll get something for it.\u201d At stake are family budgets, America's prominence as the world's leading financial power and the structure of the global economy. Read More: What Are Tariffs and Why Is Trump In Favor of Them? Here's what you should know about the impending trade penalties: He wants to announce import taxes, including \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs that would match the rates charged by other countries and account for other subsidies. Trump has talked about taxing the European Union, South Korea, Brazil and India, among other countries. As he announced 25% auto tariffs last week, he alleged that America has been ripped off because it imports more goods than it exports. \u201cThis is the beginning of Liberation Day in America,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth, taking a lot of things that they\u2019ve been taking over the years. They\u2019ve taken so much out of our country, friend and foe. And, frankly, friend has been oftentimes much worse than foe.\u201d In an interview Saturday with NBC News, Trump said it did not bother him if tariffs caused vehicle prices to rise because autos with more U.S. content could possibly be more competitively priced. \"I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars,\" Trump said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less because if the prices on foreign cars go up, they\u2019re going to buy American cars.\u201d Trump has also suggested that he will be flexible with his tariffs, saying he will treat other nations better than they treated the United States. But he still has plenty of other taxes coming on imports. The Republican president plans to tax imported pharmaceutical drugs, copper and lumber. He has put forth a 25% tariff on any country that imports oil from Venezuela, even though the United States also does so. Imports from China are being charged an additional 20% tax because of its role in fentanyl production. Trump has imposed separate tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico for the stated reason of stopping drug smuggling and illegal immigration. Trump also expanded his 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs to 25% on all imports. Some aides suggest the tariffs are tools for negotiation on trade and border security; others say the revenues will help reduce the federal budget deficit. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick says they will force other nations to show Trump \u201crespect.\u201d Nothing good, according to most economists. They say the tariffs would get passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices for autos, groceries, housing and other goods. Corporate profits could be lower and growth more sluggish. Trump maintains that more companies would open factories to avoid the taxes, though that process could take three years or more. Economist Art Laffer estimates the tariffs on autos, if fully implemented, could increase per vehicle costs by $4,711, though he said he views Trump as a smart and savvy negotiator. The investment bank Goldman Sachs estimates the economy will grow this quarter at an annual rate of just 0.6%, down from a rate of 2.4% at the end of last year. Mayor Andrew Ginther of Columbus, Ohio, said on Friday that tariffs could increase the median cost of a home by $21,000, making affordability more of an obstacle because building materials would cost more. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that the auto tariffs would raise $100 billion annually and the other tariffs would bring in about $600 million per year, or about $6 trillion over 10 years. As a share of the economy, that would be the largest tax increase since World War II, according to Jessica Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has suggested that tariffs would be a one-time price adjustment, rather than the start of an inflationary spiral. But Bessent's conclusion rests on tariffs being brief or contained, rather than leading other countries to retaliate with their own tariffs or seeping into other sectors of the economy. \u201cThere is a chance tariffs on goods begin to filter through to the pricing of services,\u201d said Samuel Rines, a strategist at WisdomTree. \u201cAuto parts get move expensive, then auto repair gets more expensive, then auto insurance feels the pressure. While goods are the focus, tariffs could have a longer-term effect on inflation.\u201d Read More: These Are the U.S. Cities Most Vulnerable to Canadian Tariffs, a New Report Finds Most foreign leaders see the tariffs as destructive for the global economy, even if they are prepared to impose their own countermeasures. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Trump's tariff threats had ended the partnership between his country and the United States, even as the president on Friday talked about his phone call with Carney in relatively positive terms. Canada already has announced retaliatory tariffs. French President Emmanuel Macron said the tariffs were \u201cnot coherent\u201d and would mean \"breaking value chains, creating inflation in the short term and destroying jobs. It\u2019s not good for the American economy, nor for the European, Canadian or Mexican economies.\u201d Yet Macron said his nation would defend itself with the goal of dismantling the tariffs. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has avoided the tit-for-tat responses on tariffs, but she sees it as critical to defend jobs in her country. The Chinese government said Trump's tariffs would harm the global trading system and would not fix the economic challenges identified by Trump. \u201cThere are no winners in trade wars or tariff wars, and no country\u2019s development and prosperity are achieved through imposing tariffs,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said. Based off Trump's public statements, April 2 is at least the third \u201cliberation day\u201d that he has identified. At a rally last year in Nevada, he said the day of the presidential election, Nov. 5, would be \u201cLiberation Day in America.\u201d He later gave his inauguration the same label, declaring in his address: \u201cFor American citizens, Jan. 20, 2025, is Liberation Day.\u201d His repeated designation of the term is a sign of just how much importance Trump places on tariffs, an obsession of his since the 1980s. Dozens of other countries recognize their own form of liberation days to recognize events such as overcoming Nazi Germany or the end of a previous political regime deemed oppressive. Trump sees his tariffs as providing national redemption, but the slumping consumer confidence and stock market indicate that much of the public believes the U.S. economy will pay the price for his ambitions. \u201cI don\u2019t see anything positive about Liberation Day,\" said Phillip Braun, a finance professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. \u201cIt\u2019s going to hurt the U.S. economy.

You may be more interested in customer support if you\u2019re a newer investor, interactive charts if you\u2019re an advanced trader looking for the best stocks for 2025 or a beautiful app experience like Public offers if you\u2019re a digital native. The criteria for selecting the best brokerage accounts for stock trading was based on the primary criteria of trading fees, investment options, research tools and ease of use. Accounts were selected based on low or no fees, provision of a broad range of investment options and ease of use was based on research tools like screeners and research reports to make informed decisions as well as user experience and customer support quality. Fidelity is a leading brokerage for stock trading due to its balance of accessibility with powerful optionality. This account offers a range of tools for trading for each level of investor while providing user-friendliness across all platforms. Known as a discount brokerage, it offers low fees for trading as well as options and fractional share trading. Fidelity scores 5\/5 for ease of use due to excellent customer support, broad investment options, polished user experience and research tools including stock screeners and analyst ratings. Charles Schwab, another leading brokerage firm, excels for stock trading whether you\u2019re a novice investor or advanced trader in need of a suite of tools to capture alpha. Like Fidelity, Schwab offers consistent access to tools across platforms, all of the investment options needed for stock trading and excellent 24\/7 customer support. This brokerage scores 5\/5 for ease of use for the reasons mentioned, as well as useful trading tools like screeners, Schwab Stock Lists and analyst reports to ensure investors have sufficient information to make reasonable trades. E*Trade is another top brokerage option for stock trading due to its low fees, thorough research tools including Morningstar reports and screeners and easy-to-use interface. E*Trade offers a primary platform for trading for regular investors and Power E*Trade with advanced opportunity-finding tools and charting for advanced traders. E*Trade scores 4.5\/5, losing half a point due to its lack of fractional share trading, which may be less than ideal for investors who have less funds to trade full shares and may be more interested in buying stocks for beginners. IBKR Lite by Interactive Brokers offers a powerful platform with low costs, especially for options contracts, intended for advanced traders. Through IBKR Lite, traders can access the advanced tools they need like analyst ratings and screeners across Trader Workstation for desktop or the IBKR mobile app. While IBKR Lite is an excellent choice for stock trading, it earns just a 4\/5 due to its at-times complicated platform intended more for experienced traders rather than new investors. Merrill Edge Self-Directed provides a leading investing experience for beginner and seasoned investors with low fees and advanced research tools including access to Bank of America Global Research, screeners, and Morningstar ratings. While the user experience is not as sleek as Public for example, Merrill Edge Self-Directed does offer a good experience for Bank of America customers who want a more integrated banking and investing experience. This brokerage loses a point in ease-of-use with 4\/5 for ease due to its lack of fractional share trading. Public is a top choice for stock trading due to its sleek design, low fees and unique rebate program for options trading, and innovative investing tools like AI research. This brokerage offers a broad suite of investment options from fractional shares to a margin product. Public scores 3.5\/5 for ease-of-use due to limited research tools without a Premium account, while still offering a powerful trading platform to free users. Robinhood is a primary cause of why every brokerage firm on this list offers fee-free trading. With its broad investment offerings for trading, easy-to-use mobile and desktop applications, and low fees, Robinhood is excellent for new traders. Robinhood scores just 3\/5 for ease of use due to limited customer support options as well as pay-walled research behind Robinhood Gold. Bottom Line As brokerage accounts continue to launch new features and compete more on price and technology, this list will change. The incumbents will need to innovate and better serve investors and traders or be crushed by newcomers to the market, hungry to become the best brokerage available. Whether you choose a long-time favorite like Charles Schwab or an innovative new brokerage like Robinhood, ensure you\u2019re aware of competing features and fees so you can trade as effectively as possible. Yes, you can open multiple brokerage accounts with the same broker or different brokers. Investors may choose to open multiple brokerage accounts to access different tools or manage different trading strategies.\u00a0 Some brokerage accounts charge trading fees but many brokers now offer commission-free trading for stocks and ETFs specifically while still charging fees for options or other types of investments. Yes, you can transfer an existing brokerage account to a new broker, maintaining your holdings and not having to sell them. Some brokers charge a fee when you move an existing account to a different brokerage.\u00a0 Yes, online trading as a form of speculative investing, carries risks including the partial or total loss of your investment principal.

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"ByVirginia La Torre Jeker, J.D.  ByVirginia La Torre Jeker, J.D.,  Contributor.  Options on foreign company stock offer exciting opportunities for U.S. employees. They come with ... More complex U.S. tax implications, however, that can catch the uninformed off guard. As more Americans take on international roles, stock options have become a key part of the expatriate executive\u2019s compensation package, especially when working for foreign employers. These options offer exciting opportunities to benefit from a company\u2019s growth, but they also come with complex U.S. tax implications that can catch the unwary off guard. Imagine you\u2019re an American executive at a tech startup in London, and your employer offers you stock options as a perk. It\u2019s a chance to share in the company\u2019s success, but what does it mean for your U.S. taxes? The rules differ from those for traditional wages, and missteps can lead to unexpected tax bills. This article breaks down the U.S. tax treatment of non-statutory stock options. These are the most common type received from foreign employers as they are not granted under either an employee stock purchase plan or an incentive stock option plan. Each stage of stock options given in connection with employment from grant, to exercise, and a later sale of purchased shares has tax implications. This article highlights the key U.S. tax considerations at every step and reviews a tax planning strategy that could save money. When a foreign employer grants an individual non-statutory stock options, the individual typically does not owe U.S. tax because of the option grant. This assumes the options lack what is called a \u201creadily ascertainable fair market value\u201d, which is common with private companies since options on such stock are not publicly traded. A potential pitfall lies in Section 409A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, which governs deferred compensation. If the options defer compensation in a way that triggers Section 409A, the individual could face taxes and penalties because of the option grant. Section 409A commonly applies when stock options have an exercise price below the stock\u2019s fair market value at the time of grant or if they include features that allow deferral of income beyond standard vesting and exercise terms. The significant tax event typically occurs when the individual exercises the options by purchasing the stock. The difference between the stock\u2019s fair market value at exercise and the price the individual pays is treated as ordinary income. For example, if the individual pays $30 per share and the stock\u2019s FMV is $100, the individual reports $70 per share as income. For Americans living and working overseas, this income might qualify for the foreign earned income exclusion (up to $130,000 in 2025) if the work tied to the options was performed abroad. Determining how much of this income is foreign versus U.S-source, can become complex and depends on the individual\u2019s specific circumstances. An examination of the individual\u2019s services, and where and when they were carried out in relation to the options being granted is needed. This complexity makes expert advice essential. If the stock purchased by the employee upon exercise of the option is considered \u201csubstantially nonvested\u201d then the employee will not be taxed at the time he exercises the option. In order for the stock to be considered \u201csubstantially nonvested\u201d there are two requirements. The stock must be: (i) nontransferable and (ii) \u201crestricted\u201d so as to be \u201csubject to a substantial risk of forfeiture\u201d (e.g., the individual loses the stock if he leaves the company within a certain time period). If both of these restrictions are met, the employee will not be taxed at the time he exercises the option. Taxation will occur at a later time when either one of the restrictions lapse. At that time, the individual is taxed on the difference between the FMV of the stock at time of lapse minus the option price he paid. Assuming the value of the stock has risen in the meantime, the employee will pay higher tax. This is so because he will have more compensation income and compensation income is treated and taxed as \u2018ordinary income\u2019 with a current maximum rate of 37%. In contrast, when the employee reports income at the time he exercises the option (for example, because the stock he acquired by exercising the option was not \u201csubstantially nonvested\u201d), he would acquire a basis in the stock equal to the FMV of the stock at that time. When the stock is later sold, any future appreciation after the option was exercised would generally be taxed as capital gain. If the gain is taxed as \u201clong term\u201d capital gain, it is taxed much more favorably (generally at top rates of 15% or 20%) in comparison to \u201cordinary income\u201d rates. Here is an example: Assume the individual exercises options when the stock is worth $100, paying $20, but restrictions prevent selling for two years, and the stock rises to $150 when the restrictions lift. The individual is taxed on $150 - $20 = $130 as ordinary income (with a top rate of 37%). If taxation had occurred at exercise, the individual would owe tax on $100 - $20 = $80 of ordinary income. Any later gain would be capital gain. The delay can result in a higher tax bill if the stock rises, so timing is significant. If the stock is substantially nonvested, the individual can make an election under Code Section 83(b) to pay tax at exercise of the option instead of waiting for the restrictions to lapse. The individual would report the FMV at exercise minus the option price as ordinary income at that time. Future appreciation would be treated as capital gain. Using the earlier example, electing at exercise taxes the individual on $80 ($100 - $20) upfront. If the stock rises to $150 by the time restrictions lapse and the individual sells at $200, the $100 gain ($200 - $100) is capital gain. The election is not free of risk. The individual pays tax upfront, even if the stock value declines or if the stock is forfeited later. If the value of the stock drops to $50, the individual would have paid tax on $80 that was never realized. It is a calculated risk and one that must be carefully evaluated. When a U.S. person owns shares in foreign entities, special tax considerations come into play. These include foreign information return reporting, for example, on Form 8938. Such reporting gets confusing with the grant to an employee of options on foreign stock or restricted foreign stock itself. Reporting on Form 8938 may be required if the option or shares are treated as a \u201cspecified foreign financial asset.\u201d Unvested shares and options generally may be disregarded for purposes of Form 8938 until the time of vesting, unless the individual makes a valid election to include the assets in income under Code Section 83(b). The foreign country where the taxpayer is living and working may also tax the stock option at grant, exercise, or sale, depending on local tax laws. Some countries tax options as employment income upon vesting or exercise, while others treat gains as capital gains upon sale. This can lead to double taxation if both the U.S. and the foreign country tax the same income. To mitigate this, proper tax planning is essential to maximize the use of foreign tax credits, avoid timing mismatches, and ensure compliance with both U.S. and foreign tax rules. A tax professional familiar with cross-border taxation can help structure the reporting to minimize overall tax liability and take advantage of tax treaties where applicable. Stock options can enhance an expatriate\u2019s wealth, but the tax rules are intricate. From the timing of taxation to the interplay of U.S. and foreign tax laws\u2014including the risk of double taxation mitigated by tax treaties\u2014the stakes are high. Understanding the basics is a starting point, but personalized advice from a tax professional familiar with international rules is essential to maximize benefits and ensure compliance.

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"ByBilly Bambrough  ByBilly Bambrough,  Senior Contributor.  03\/30 update below. This post was originally published on March 29 Bitcoin and crypto prices have dropped back as inflation fears and U.S. president Donald Trump\u2019s tariff threats continue to weigh on the bitcoin price (as well as fresh fears over a new, mystery hack). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes\u2019 CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can \"uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!\" The bitcoin price has fallen back toward $80,000 per bitcoin after soaring toward $90,000 this week even after the confirmation of a long-awaited bitcoin game-changer. Now, as bitcoin is found to be outperforming Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla, legendary crypto trader Arthur Hayes has predicted the Federal Reserve will trigger a bitcoin price boom in April. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex\u2014A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell could be about to trigger bitcoin price and crypto market ... More mayhem. \u201cThere was a seminal change in the [Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell\u2019s] tone at the last Fed board meeting,\u201d Hayes, the cofounder of crypto derivatives pioneer BitMex who went onto launch the Maelstrom investment company, told podcaster Kyle Chasse. Earlier this month, the Fed\u2019s rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kept interest rates on hold after kicking off a rate-cutting cycle in September. 03\/30 update: Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, who has clashed with president Donald Trump over the pace of interest rate reductions, could be fired by the president, an influential Democratic Party senator has warned.  \u201cNobody is safe, not even the chairman of the Federal Reserve,\" Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren told Bloomberg. \"If [Trump] can just mow through every civil servant, if he can just mow through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, it\u2019s a form of lawlessness and all the power belongs to the king.\" Warren\u2019s warning comes as Trump, aided by Tesla billionaire Elon Musk who\u2019s leading the Doge department of government efficiency in a rampage through the federal government, has gutted agencies, departments and institutions in the mere two months he\u2019s been back in the White House. Fed chair Powell, appointed by Trump in his first term, has said he wants to take a wait-and-see approach to lowering interest rates, which remain elevated after Covid era stimulus and lockdowns sent inflation spiraling out of control. However, Trump has called for rates to be lowered immediately, claiming lower rates would help his plan for wide-scale international trade tariffs. \u201cThe Fed would be much better off cutting rates as U.S. tariffs start to transition (ease!) their way into the economy,\u201d Trump posted to his Truth Social account last week, telling Powell and the Fed to, \u201cdo the right thing.\u201d The FOMC downgraded its outlook for economic growth while nudging up its inflation projection and further scaling back of its \u201cquantitative tightening\u201d program in which it is slowly reducing the bonds it holds on its balance sheet. Hayes, who\u2019s this week been granted a pardon along with his fellow BitMex founders Benjamin Delo and Samuel Reed for Bank Secrecy Act violations by U.S. president Donald Trump, believes the Fed is \"teasing\" a return to \u201cstealth\u201d money printing known as quantitative easing even as it\u2019s grappling with the $36 trillion U.S. debt pile that\u2019s spiraled out of control since 2020. Hayes pointed to comments made by Powell at the latest Fed press conference that \u201cinflationary aspects of tariffs are transitory.\" \u201cTariffs don\u2019t matter any more to Powell, and they shouldn\u2019t matter as crypto investors,\u201d said Hayes. \u201cIf Trump does 50% or he does 2%, it doesn\u2019t matter, because we know that Powell is going to continue to provide the easy monetary conditions that we need to have our portfolios go up in fiat dollars.\u201d Sign up now for CryptoCodex\u2014A free, daily newsletter for the crypto-curious The bitcoin price has rocketed higher in recent years, with a Federal Reserve flip predicted to push ... More the bitcoin price. Trump\u2019s latest tariffs, which have roiled the bitcoin price, crypto and stock markets, are set to hit goods from Canada, Mexico and China from April 2. Meanwhile, the bitcoin price could be about to rebound toward $90,000, according to 10x Research founder Markus Thielen, who has predicted a combination of Trump\u2019s softening of tariffs and an increasingly dovish Fed is setting bitcoin up for a recovery. \u201cBitcoin is attempting to form a bottom, supported by Trump\u2019s recent shift toward \u2018flexibility\u2019 on the upcoming April 2 reciprocal tariffs, softening his earlier rhetoric,\u201d Thielen wrote in an emailed note. Thielen pointed to Fed chair Powell\u2019s signal that it would \u201clook past short-term inflationary pressures, laying the groundwork for potential future easing,\u201d Thielen added. \u201cPowell\u2019s mildly dovish tone suggests that the Fed\u2019s put remains intact, providing further support for a recovery in stock prices.\u201d","label":1}

I hope you're having a great day; it's the weekend, after all. The Windows Central team has been having a lot of fun reading and responding to your comments in our awesome new comments system, and I'd like to take advantage to ask YOU a question. What graphics card do you have in your PC and why? It's so far been a busy 2025 for anyone who follows graphics card (GPU) news. NVIDIA revealed its new \"Blackwell\" generation of RTX 50-series GPUs at CES 2025 in January, and in the following months, it launched the RTX 5090, RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070. AMD played the waiting game, pulling its Radeon RX 9000 \"RDNA 4\" CES presentation at the last moment. We finally got an official RDNA 4 announcement on February 28, and the Radeon RX 9070 XT and Radeon RX 9070 launched on March 6, 2025. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. I can't forget about Intel, which unveiled its Arc B-series \"Battlemage\" GPUs in December 2024. Intel's latest cards hit shelves on December 13 and quickly sold out everywhere thanks to their bargain pricing and strong 1440p performance. While the GPU news surrounding AMD and Intel has been mostly positive, NVIDIA has been receiving flak for a number of issues surrounding its Blackwell GPUs, including melting power cables, missing ROPs, faulty drivers, underbaked AI tools, and just general performance (as is the case with the RTX 5070's harsh reviews).  The GPU market is currently going through a shift. NVIDIA is now focused on producing 50-series GPUs, making 40-series cards much harder to find at anywhere near a reasonable price. AMD's Radeon RX 9000 GPUs are nearly impossible to find despite promises of plenty of stock, and many people are waiting for the latest hardware rather than investing in one of the RDNA 3 cards that remain relatively plentiful. \ud83d\udc49 Related: NVIDIA RTX 5080 Founders Edition review Intel's Battlemage GPUs, well, they're such a good bargain that they continue to be elusive months after launch. Bottom line? It's tough out there for anyone trying to land a new GPU. In my case, I'm waiting for an AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT to replace my aging RX 6800. Unfortunately, sourcing one in Canada hasn't been easy, and I'm considering picking up a 5070 Ti since they seem to be more readily available. Go figure.

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"For many years, well-off Nigerians have sent their children to prestigious British boarding schools - but now some of those institutions are setting up campuses in Africa's most populous nation. Last year, Charterhouse launched a primary school in the city of Lagos and will open a secondary school this September. Rugby School will also begin offering secondary education in September. Other well-known institutions, such as Millfield, Wellington College and Harrow, are also exploring opportunities in Nigeria. This obviously all comes with a price tag for Nigerian parents - but the country's well-heeled elite have historically sent their children to the UK for secondary education, drawn to the British curriculum's rigour, prestige and global opportunities. \"I'm actually excited about it,\" says Karima Oyede, a British-Nigerian management consultant, whose son is currently in year 10 at Rugby in the UK but will be moving to its Lagos school in September. Her family has been meaning to relocate to Nigeria for a while but has not done so earlier because of the children's education. \"Having the opportunity to experience the British system in his country of origin is the best of both worlds,\" she says. Nigeria already has a proliferation of private schools but high-quality, internationally recognised education within the country will appeal to many parents, particularly those who wish to preserve their children's cultural identity. \"African parents love the fact that they are giving their children international standing so they can compete with their counterparts in any other part of the world, but they don't want their children to lose their African-ness,\" says Ijay Uwakwe-Okoronkwo, the founder of Nkuzhi Learning Foundation in Nigeria's capital, Abuja. The educational consultant, who advises parents and schools on international boarding options, explains the more relaxed, less respectful attitude children return with after going to school abroad is not always appreciated. This cultural dilemma extends to the growing conversation around LGBTQ issues. Same-sex relationships and public displays of affection are illegal in Nigeria and homosexuality is not openly discussed or promoted. It is something that the new crop of British schools has taken on board. For example, while Charterhouse UK displays a rainbow flag, the Nigeria school does not. \"We're a British independent school but sitting firmly within Nigerian cultural needs,\" says John Todd, head of Charterhouse Nigeria. \"There's this huge concern about Western cultural views. \"For parents here, we know it's a really big issue. It's a reason parents are worried about the UK schools. \"I'm not making a judgement - it's just the way it is.\" British institutions in Nigeria have no choice but to \"follow the law of the land\", he acknowledges, adding: \"We are 100% compliant.\" Recognising Nigeria's deeply religious society, Charterhouse also permits parents to take their children home from the boarding house for Sunday church services, with the expectation that they return by Monday morning. There are several reasons behind the growing interest of prestigious British schools in opening campuses in Nigeria. While regions like the Middle East and China are already saturated with international schools, Africa is relatively virgin territory. \"Nigeria is the gateway to Africa, and Africa is kind of the last continent for British schools to establish in,\" says Mark Brooks, an export champion for the UK's Department for Business and Trade. He organises annual events in Nigeria where about 20 British schools meet prospective students and parents. \"Nigeria has an incredible reputation for producing driven, high-achieving students,\" says Mr Brooks. \"There is no school I work with that hasn't recently had a Nigerian student serve as head boy or deputy head boy. A student may join the sixth form and end up being the head boy within a year. \"I've brought hundreds of head teachers to Nigeria over the years, and the word is out in the UK that we need to take Nigeria seriously.\" Timing has also proved key, as the cost of sending children to the UK has soared. Just three years ago, the exchange rate of the local currency was 500 naira to \u00a31; now it stands at 2,200 naira. On top of that, the Labour government in the UK recently imposed 20% VAT on private school fees. Beyond tuition, families face additional expenses like flights for both students and visiting parents. Establishing these schools in Nigeria allows families to maintain the same standard of education while significantly reducing the financial strain. The annual fees at Charterhouse UK, for example, are around \u00a360,000 ($78,000), whereas the fees at its Lagos campus are equivalent to approximately \u00a315,000. \"Our main classroom teachers are expatriates, but 90% of the staff are local,\" says Mr Todd. By employing local people in roles such as assistant teachers, administration, finance, human resources, marketing, facilities, security, gardeners, drivers, PAs and secretaries, the school can significantly reduce costs compared to the UK, where labour is much more expensive. A vast education gap already exists in Nigeria, with many parents opting for private education of varying quality. Many struggle to pay the higher fees rather than sending their children to government schools, which are often free but plagued by poorly trained teachers and frequent strikes. As a result, the arrival of British schools may not drastically change Nigeria's education system. However, they could pose a threat to established elite schools like the British International School in Lagos and The Regent School in Abuja, which opened in the early 2000s. Such schools have long been top choices for those able to pay the annual tuition fees that often reach tens of thousands of dollars. \"Rugby School Nigeria is coming also to support, develop and learn from the schools currently in Nigeria,\" says Mr Brooks, who is in charge of the school's marketing. \"We are coming to help with partnerships as well, teacher training, and a whole range of initiatives.\" Mr Todd believes the Nigerian market is large enough to accommodate all the new schools without threatening existing ones. About 40% of the 200 million population is under 14. He expects the greatest impact to be felt in the UK. While Charterhouse UK typically has a long waiting list and should not be affected, less sought-after boarding schools may experience a decline in enrolment owing to the new competition in Nigeria. \"Interest in our secondary school is very strong,\" says Mr Todd. \"We already have Nigerian parents in the UK sending their children to the Charterhouse in Nigeria for September.\" In fact, reaching out to Nigerians in the UK has been one of their key marketing strategies. \"You get this premier brand at a lower price, and every Nigerian has an aunt or uncle in Lagos\" who can be a guardian, he adds. It could be that this trend extends to British universities. Nigeria's tertiary education system faces even greater challenges than its secondary sector, with many students opting to study abroad. In 2023, Nigeria ranked among the top 10 countries for UK student visas, according to UK government data. But with foreign exchange difficulties and stricter visa regulations, studying abroad is becoming increasingly challenging - and universities that rely on higher international tuition fees appear to be suffering. Earlier this month, British MP Helen Hayes, chair of the parliamentary Education Committee, acknowledged the UK's higher education sector was in trouble. \"Dozens of universities are making redundancies and cuts to courses, trying to stay afloat amid uncertainty over where their money is coming from,\" she said when announcing a session to consider the sector's future. If enough Nigerian students can no longer go to the UK to study, British universities may find it profitable to come to them, as they have elsewhere in the world. In fact, Nigeria's premier university, the University of Ibadan, was established in 1948 as a campus of the University of London, with degrees awarded carrying the same value and prestige. Ms Uwakwe-Okoronkwo believes many Nigerian parents would appreciate this opportunity, as it would allow their children to stay in Nigeria long enough to mature before potentially moving abroad, if they choose to do so. \"Many parents are worried about sending their children out of the nest too early,\" she says. For Ms Oyede, whose daughter will also be starting at Rugby School in Lagos come September, the timing of all this could not be better. She says the British school opening has already been an \"incentive to return home\".  The prospect of university opportunities would be a welcome bonus.

As long as they get a good baseline (people who have it as a patch for typically cancer pain relief) then fine. NB I did work to get the patches used more often in oncology in Canada in 1997. In interests of full disclosure. My now-deceased wife used the Fentanyl patch while in hospice care. For some resson I decided to read the enclosed circular\u2013 all,  I dunno, 14\u2033x 20\u2033 of it on two sides. I found something that made sense: if the patient is running a fever, there is danger of an overdose. None of the nurses I spoke with were aware of this problem. So sorry about your wife. Whilst I \u201cgot\u201d that so many pain specialists had left the UK NHS in favour of places like Canada, I still regret my part of \u201cover-addressing the problem\u201d. I used fentanyl patches, Fluoribuprofen and Soma for a about a year to deal with the pain caused by my spinal injuries. This was a step down from the stronger painkillers I needed the three previous years. I also used Cannabis from the dispensary on Church St in SF, the first medical dispensary in California, member #104. It all helped, but I still could not sleep with anything touching my right leg for almost 4 years due to an inflamed sciatic nerve. > Democrats are reportedly pushing for a Sanders\/AOC 2028 presidential ticket\u2026  Bernie \u2018Scabbard\u2019 Sanders. Question: what was AOC\u2019s background before running? Did you think \u2018Bartender\u2019? Did you think \u2018cum laude of the Pardee School\u2019? Which did you think first? Well there was that dress she wore to some posh ball daubed with Tax the Rich on the back. But I am sure any competent dry cleaner would get that stain off in full, were she to ever run. Bernie Sanders for President? Third time lucky? If somehow this happened, what about his age? For christsake, he was born months before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour back in \u2013 \u201941. He would be sworn in at the age of 87 and if he even managed to finish his first term, he would be 91. So if AOC was his Veep, this would be a backdoor way of getting AOC as President who never met a cause that she did not find worthy of selling out. It\u2019s not going to happen, it\u2019s just a distraction to keep the left busy pouring time and money into some pie-in-the-sky hopey-changey fantasy for 2028.   Could keep them from real activism for years while the oligarchs finish demolishing the republic. I don\u2019t think that it is going to happen either. But it seems that the Democrats have an awfully thin bench to choose from for 2028. The Democrats are hoping for Trump to find a way to run again because his terms were not consecutive. Hopefully Obama chooses someone other than Biden for VP this time. Boy howdy, can\u2019t wait for the return of the man who broke the color barrier like Jackie did! His stats over an 8 year career in the bigs tell the tale: .199 batting average 22 home runs, mostly when his team was comfortably ahead in the game 14 attempted steals-2 successful Whoa!? If you\u2019re referring to Jackie Robinson chk your stats. He batted .311. https:\/\/www.espn.com\/mlb\/player\/stats\/_\/id\/26863\/jackie-robinson Halt goes there. You appear to be the victim of a failed joke, if this condition persists please seek help. I\u2019m stealing that line! Impossible. Constitution doesn\u2019t allow it (assuming Trump doesn\u2019t simply ignore it ). It was just as thin in 2020 and they went with the demented old guy rather than the capable but not totally donor subservient old guy. (And yeah, Sanders would probably have gotten rolled if he got in, but at least he wasn\u2019t clearly having cognitive difficulties). The sad thing is that they have so embubbled themselves that they didn\u2019t even realize they needed to start developing candidates after that, so that thin bench has the exact same names as it did then. We\u2019ve all seen this movie before, sadly \u2026 The Plot Does Not Thicken \u2026 \u2022 Bernie and AOC barnstorm for the next 3\u00bd years \u2022 Regardless of who is top-of-the-ticket, establishment Dems retreat to the dark, cigar-smoking room and plan to upend a Sanders\/AOC nomination \u2022 Clinton wing may choose to run Abuela again; Wizard of Kalorama\u2122 will probably back Pritzker; Newsom has the bux, the looks, and the largest delegate haul state. \u2022 Even if Sanders\/AOC come out of the box hot, and win the first few primaries like Bernie did in 2020, Obama The Wizard\u2122 and HRC The Witch\u2122 will pull the strings to yank whomever needs be in order to clear the way for #TheChosenOne\u2122 \u2022 Cue Sanders\/AOC primary dive \u2022 Cue every #VBNMW slogan: \u201cMost important election of your lives!\u201d; \u201cVote like your life depends on it!\u201d; \u201cDemocracy is on the ballot! Again!\u201d \u2022 Cue Sanders\/AOC capitulation, and the electorate is told again to vote for a billionaire-backed candidate who supports: Ukraine war; Gaza genocide; balanced government budget; ballooning defense budget; working class belt-tightening \u2022 Fin #AmIRite? \u2018\u2026the Thriller in Vanilla!\u2019 LOL Is that what we\u2019re calling Oor Gav\u2019 now?! Bingo. The dems would rather run Kamala or Hakeem Jefferies and lose\u2026than AOC or Bernie and win. Too many broken rice bowls. Alf was probably considered the likely GOP candidate for the 1940 race, after getting run over by FDR in 1936, so there is precedence for optimism in Kamala for a 2028 bid. Hmm\u2026.  interesting thought:  three years from now, how many of those rice bowls will be left intact? Or it could be that AOC is going to cover herself in the mantle of Sanders, who will be too old come the next Primaries. Maybe he can be wheeled out to wave. Or harrumph at the appropriate times. So having covered herself in the Sanders vibe  AOC will then go about perverting anything he has ever said or done so that in the end it will look like the usual Dem stuff, with a few lies thrown in.   The neoSanders ticket will look a lot like the old Clinton ticket or any of the approved contenders. And isnt Obama one of her mentors? More hope and change. Then eternal war and looting once elected. yes, just sad to see him cheapened by her presence on stage with him. Yes, I wish he hadn\u2019t forsaken movement for electoral politics after being back-stabbed by the Democrats in 2016 and 2020. But I still have enormous fondness and respect for him\u2014for his consistency, his integrity\u2014unlike how I feel about, say, Obama (shudder). And despite backing down when it maybe could have really counted, he still does good things more often than anybody else in DC (think introducing a bill last year to stop the flow of armaments to Israel). His current tour was a bright spot on my horizon until he started bringing her on. Sanders does lots of talking, gesturing, and hand-wringing, but does not have a lot to show for all the flaling. Hearing what he has to say makes for feel-good moments. Then, too, he is very happy about Lockheed Martin\u2019s F-35 in VT! (https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2019\/07\/10\/bernie-sanders-faces-backlash-over-war-machine-he-brought-to-vermont.html) AOC? A poseur! Bernie is one guy in Congress; WTF do you expect? He only ran with the Dems bc the rethug MAGAtes were out of the question. And without caucusing w the Dems, he\u2019d just be a solo outsider with no juice at all. And, finally, they shot him in the back in 2020. Take it easy on the poor guy.  He is out on the trail \u2026. Anybody else in sight? At this point, I\u2019d much rather see them putting this very big energy into a third party. It might have a chance with this much time before the next election. All they\u2019re doing now is getting in front of a mob, calling it a parade, and bringing it right back to the people who continue to pay themselves billions of dollars to lose. Big money, energy and time suck. Losers. I\u2019d put decent odds on Governor Newsom running or starting to float out those trial balloons for what or how a possible Presidential run might shape.  If I understand correctly he is intertwined with alot of serious sources for funding like the Getty family fortune heirs, to name one.  And now I have to admit that I do miss our dear Lambert and his handy diagrams\u2026 Name recognition is building for him\u2026for good or for ill.  \u201d How can you interview that scum Bannon! \u201d I\u2019m sure that goes over like a fart in church but Newsom does seem at a minimum, willing to host discussion talks with some people the Democrats find beyond any redemption or worth hearing.  It can be a cynical move but he\u2019s ahead of others in that vein, it seems. To be honest, Newsom reminds me of what was once said of John Kerry \u2013 \u2018He\u2019s just a haircut in search of a brain.\u2019 I lived in the Bay Area for several decades. I don\u2019t know how much it matters these days, but Newsom has the potential to have substantial numbers of people emerge and tattle about, forex, how they saw him snorting cocaine at Jeremiah Tower\u2019s Stars restaurant and various other SF hot spots of the 1990s-era. He is such a skilled sycophant he would thrive in the Saudi royal court. Left handed compliments will get you nowhere. Sinister observation, but handy for determining where Newsoms \u201cs\u2014 eating grin\u201d came from. \u201cBut Highness, I thought that you preferred Afghani dancing boys.\u201d \u201cWorry not smooth lipped Gavin.

Guy on the street yesterday was busy telling me that the buses were running every four minutes, and it was thanks to Cuomo. Didn\u2019t really have an answer for me when I asked how, as he holds no official office and has no means of enforcing such an edict. \u201cHe did it.\u201d Oh, and Andy\u2019s a victim. That might have been the craziest pro Cuomo discussion I have had or eavesdropped on, but he is the front runner everywhere I turn these days.  I was hoping that NYC residents were not delusional enough to elect him, but I am going to be sadly disappointed. That said, I don\u2019t think either Cuomo or Newsom could get elected to dog catcher nationally. There is nothing about either of them that appeals outside of the blue bubbles they reside in. No mayor of NYC has ever become prez. Some sort of curse. re: that diagram. Here you go: https:\/\/calmatters.org\/commentary\/2019\/01\/gavin-newsoms-keeping-it-all-in-the-family\/ I miss plants, too. My intense interest. Yeah ok.. and there is a tooth fairy and Easter bunny. Again, more performative stuff from the DNC. How many divisions do Bernie and AOC have? More like how many oligarch patrons do they have.  I expect Mayo Pete or some other mouth-only smile empty suit to run and lose. My dark horse pick would be JB Pritzker. Billionaire, photogenic and can-do the Everyman spiel. Midwest and rich? Sounds like a donors\u2019 silver bullet. Pritzker is bad for Illinois and will be bad for America. Perfect for the Globalists. And he\u2019s being pretty low key, aside from statewide grandstanding against Trump every now and again. I think he\u2019s waiting out the current dems scratching out each others\u2019 eyes and will rise like a phoenix in a year or so. I apologize for the flawed rhetorical structure of the question, a little salty for breakfast. To clarify the AOC questions: The earliest dated note I have is from Oct 2018: : vulgartrader.com\/post\/178670458510\/is-ocasio-cortez-an-intelligence-agent I\u2019m not sure when I was exposed to this, and my pre-2018 notes were corrupted in a cyberattack. It contains links to : : Cortez is the recipient of degrees in Economics and International Relations from Boston University. : As discussed in the DecipherYou series, degrees in International Relations are often a recruitment ground for intelligence agencies. There are missing links for econ and international\/foreign relations being very specific, and to the Boston University Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies. Here\u2019s an explicit link: bu.edu\/pardeeschool\/2024\/08\/30\/pardee-alumna-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-delivers-speech-at-2024-democratic-national-convention\/ > Boston University\u2019s Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies saw one of its alumni take center stage at the 2024 Democratic National Convention. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who graduated from the Pardee School in 2011, delivered a speech that has been noted as a significant moment of the evening. and a link to the history of the underlying program: cia.gov\/resources\/csi\/static\/Twenty-Years-Officers-Residence.pdf > Two especially hospitable academic settings\u2014Boston University and Georgetown\u2014 made possible the first running of courses devoted strictly to intelligence. Another early bird was Cory Morningstar linking AOC to corporate Green New Deal: wrongkindofgreen.org\/2019\/02\/13\/the-manufacturing-of-greta-thunberg-for-consent-the-new-green-deal-is-the-trojan-horse-for-the-financialization-of-nature\/ Reviewing her history left an impression of the number of tire tracks she left on backs along the way. To finish: Yves (Dec 2024): All of that kissing up to Pelosi for naught. Even though this sounds a bit like a QAnon conspiracy theory, there is a lot of truth to what you say here. AOC was clearly selected and groomed by someone with power and imagination. She was of course \u201ctelegenic.\u201d Her background, as you say, was rather expertly tailored by media savvy consultants. She came out of nowhere to gain national prominence quickly (like a couple of other Democratic Presidential candidates I recall). She was a \u201cleft\u201d Democrat without really having to do anything substantive on that score in the House (while \u201ckissing up to Pelosi\u201d). Now she is being trotted around the country with Bernie to give her street cred by association with those Democrats who still believe. Bernie will not run. He is too old, as he himself has pointed out. This is a sheep-herding mission. AOC is what the \u201cprogressive\u201d wing of the Democratic party is now. She would have no chance in a national election. The Republicans have successfully painted her with the \u201cwoke\u201d brush and I don\u2019t think she could retain Bernie\u2019s 2016 working\/middle class base. But then who else do the Dems have? I\u2019m sorry, but this is yet another example of people wanting to think that the universe is under more control than it is. As Leit-Kynes realized when he was dying in Dune, its most enduring principles are accident and error. AOC was NOT chosen, save by Justice Democrats (ie, a non-mainstream Bernie-aligned bunch after Bernie 1.0, before he had hired a lot of \u201cprofessional \u201d staffers who diluted his 1.0  message when he ran again), which was a progressive PAC that did have a limited amount of success in getting some reps elected but folded based on the view it had failed to achieve its mission. She was NOT \u201csupposed\u201d to win her first Congressional bid. She took out the #4 Democrat in the House to general shock and consternation. She has been successfully housebroken by the party over time. My impression is she won her district by knocking on doors and connecting with voters. She was not a product of the machine. That was before she was exposed to the levers of power. AOC\u2019s campaign was whipsmart. Trends are hard to pull due to redistricting, but Crowley was unopposed in the previous primary, and had an enormous money advantage including the third party run against her in the main. ballotpedia.org\/Alexandria_Ocasio-Cortez At this point, vast ambition is as good an explanation as being a spook tool. Her credentials met Chomsky\u2019s criteria (\u2018If you believed something different, you wouldn\u2019t be sitting where you\u2019re sitting.\u2019) What is notable is the erasure. Here\u2019s Elizabeth Warren writing for AOC\u2019s \u2018Time 100 Most Influential People 2019\u2019 entry: > A year ago, she was taking orders across a bar. Today, millions are taking cues from her. Invert the question. Pardee School cum laude and the best job she can get is bartending in the Bronx? Clever girl. Yes, I find ambition, hard work, and knowing how to organize as being key. Had she been \u201cgroomed,\u201d she would have done politics the conventional way and not won her seat.  Cum laude is not all that distinguished. But she did win a fancy science award and had an asteroid named after her as a result. So she was a star, literally, early. WSWS performed a very thorough demystification of AOC\u2019s progressive credentials.  It left me with the impression that she was a fairly opportunistic young millennial, with the neoliberal ethos common to her generation (which is also expected given her aspirations to PMC status), who went through a fairly arduous process of recruitment and training.  \u2018Brand New Congress and Justice Democrats received hundreds of submissions of prospective candidates from across the country to run in primary elections against incumbent Democrats. Ocasio-Cortez acknowledged that she underwent six months of \u201cvetting\u201d before being chosen as a candidate.\u2019 Ok. So AOC didn\u2019t just bartend. She also worked for some hispanic nonprofit, bernie\u2019s 2016 campaign, and some other things. Which makes sense as a young grad in NYC \u2013 work 2 jobs, one for the career, one for money. But bartending is the most relatable so saying that is her main job is a clever move. That is like me saying I work as a line cook when really my main job is being a college student. Secondly. A lot of people are suggesting AOC was corrupt before she came into office. To which i say nah. Being an elected official will change you as a person. I witnessed this happen to my mother. My mother circa 2016 would have been appalled at the 2024 version of her sending out negative campaign ads. She also developed more mainstream dem talking points. It was fun during the campaign because she has very catholic opinions on abortion but had to act like she was super pro abortion to get endorsements and donations. She would get back from campaign things and talk about how uncomfortable the lying made her but most of her team said she had to do it. The dem campaign advisor also made her include anti immigrant talking points to reach across rhe aisle which she also disliked. Point is: blame being embroiled in the democratic party, not AOC being some cia insider mastermind. AOC interned under Ted Kennedy. She would have learned from him to appear just a bit to the left of the Democratic party without challenging the people who pull the levers. Ted may have been more New Deal Democrat, but when it came to pushing the people in power he backed off. Indeed, Teddy \u2013 author of trucking and airline deregulation in the 1970\u2019s and co-sponsor of No Child Left Behind in 2001 \u2013 could be helpful at times, but on the deep, structural issues, he was faithful to his class. As for Ocasio-Cortez, fwiw, a close acquaintance has good friends who live in the Parkchester development in the Bronx, AOC\u2019s literal birthplace. For years, Parkchester residents have been dealing with issues of rising costs, deferred maintenance and physical decline. They have reached out to AOC\u2019s office many times, and have consistently been blown off. The woman is a talented, nimble politician, and was initially elected via bona fide grass roots effort, but is rapidly devolving into someone whose professional success seems to be based on the political neutralization of her base. One doesn\u2019t get committee assignments for free. Even if you can change the rules you ain\u2019t gonna get far if you don\u2019t know the game. Antoinette Of Color has a cool head\u2026 My best friend interned for Ted Kennedy. He met The Senator once. He never got a gram of any cred or even a job rec from the experience but enjoyed the work. It means relatively little, except that you might have gone to a good school in Massachusetts, got decent grades, and applied for the internship. I will vote for AOC if she runs. Shoot me if you want. No.  It\u2019s your foot. Trying to lure the left wing of the party back into the fold only to pull the football away again.  The Democrats have been dead to me since 2016.  Not much I can do here  in MA but, vote 3rd party or Republican to show my displeasure. The cynic in me thinks we should all just continue to vote Republican until there\u2019s nothing left of the US. I doubt it will take long. I am guessing that the elites\/Pelosi\/Obama\/Schumer will go in the backroom, cancel primaries again or put their thumb on the scale and then we get Harris\/Newsom for 2028 or Newsom\/Buttigieg if they do not drag Harris out again. I am not sure who the Trump-clone is going to be for the Republicans in 2028, but the Democrats are going to be scratching their heads as they desperately need Donald Trump as a scapegoat to buoy their otherwise dismal and lackluster platform and of course they will continue to run the tired old Russiagate nonsense for the umpteenth time for whomever the Republican pick is. If the Democrats win, they will do nothing to reverse or probably expand the destructive policies of the Trump administration, and then if the Republicans win, the Democrats will support Republican policies 98% of the time while fundraising off of anti-Republican\/McResistance virtue-signaling. \u201cReportedly?\u201d There\u2019s no indication whatsoever that anything of the kind is happening.  And this particular account is clearly \u201creporting\u201d this purely because these are two of the official demons of its readership. As is abundantly evident in the comments Bernie\u2019s been licking Democrat Presidential boots for so long it would be nice for him to be able to just sit at home and lick his own boots for once! \u2018\u2600\ufe0f\ud83d\udc40 @zei_squirrel John Mearsheimer on the leaked Signal chat and the casual way they discuss mass killing civilians in Yemen for Israel: \u201cMike Waltz is a neo-con, he\u2019s basically owned by the Israel lobby. Of course he\u2019s talking to Jeffrey Goldberg\u2019 Maybe Waltz is envious and in awe of him because he abandoned America to live in Israel where he became an IDF prison guard. Of course Waltz would want Jeffrey Goldberg on his speed dial. In that same Napolitano episode, Mearsheimer commented how incredible it is that no one is ever held accountable for anything anymore, that this has become way things work in America and that\u2019s not a good sign. I think this lack of accountability is the most important point John Mearsheimer makes, and it holds good throughout Europe and much of the Anglophone world.  It seems to be the most obvious symptom of the totalitarian democracies which have slowly matured in the West throughout the post-war period\u2019s  managerial revolution, echoing James Burnham, bringing in it\u2019s wake the entrenchment of the phenomenom of the stable deep state and the multinational and international institutions to which our political \u00e9lites have chosen, on their citizens behalf, to entrust so many hitherto sovereign powers. I have been watching this phenomenon that powerful people are no longer accountable for over two decades now, and agree that it is behind much of the degradation we see in \u201cthe West\u201d. When TBTF became the cry of the elites during the GFC it was not a surprise to me that too big to fail also included the people running the failed institutions.  My daughter\u2019s company recently got a new CEO, and she noted to me that one of her co-workers had pointed out that the new CEO was from the CEO class. Both of her parents had been CEOs (to completely different non-family owned corporations.) So when you think your CEO is acting like a feudal lord to the peasants don\u2019t be surprised, it\u2019s how they were raised. Meritocracy is dead. Undead, I would say. We call it \u201cmerit\u201d now; back then it was called \u201cGod\u2019s grace\u201d. An excellent observation, indeed. I\u2019ve often wondered why the same people that get angry when someone in their social circle who has no control over their lives lies to them often don\u2019t get angry or even make excuses for that person if a politician lies to them, or worse, hurts them. Some explanations I have for it are that it\u2019s a selective lack of self-respect, or some form of group\/cult-like behavior. At any rate, this behavior is deeply disturbing to me. Personal integrity no longer seems to matter in politics.  don\u2019t get angry or even make excuses for that person if a politician lies to them, or worse, hurts them   \u2013 this is actually an extremely common thing in any society where a few people rule (impose law and choose how it\u2019s enforced) and the rest just are expected to deal with it. This goes into vivid detail showing how people who are trapped in abusive relations for long enough can learn to ignore the abuse, or even excuse it. All of us in the US are trapped in abusive relationships with a ruling class that clearly behaves with extreme selfishness, and people cope in a huge variety of ways \u2013 hoping the next election will make a difference, getting angry at one party, just trying to survive, or get rich, etc. Really recognizing the rot at the heart of the system would require acknowledging that the US isn\u2019t free and never has been, and most Americans haven\u2019t been free for many generations, perhaps dozens. I believe most political conversations are only as superficial as they are because people don\u2019t know what real freedom is like \u2013 ie what it\u2019s like to live in a culture that maintains a baseline of mutual respect internally, shares as a way of life, and takes humans\u2019 and nonhumans\u2019 needs into account. Most people accept things like corruption and racism as \u201chow things are,\u201d part of the human condition, so why get too upset, or really think too critically, esp if there\u2019s little that can be done anyway? Plenty of nations without corruption and discrimination show that it\u2019s possible to live without these troubles, and what a meaningful political change would look like. Re; China? I gotta add this because it\u2019s huge: CAAC allows two unmanned aircraft operators to start commercial flying business Two Chinese companies have received the first-ever civil unmanned aircraft Operator Certificate (OC) issued by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), the Global Times learned on Sunday. It marks the first time that China\u2019s civil aviation regulator issued the certificate for passenger-carrying civil unmanned aircraft, signaling the start of commercial operation in China\u2019s low-altitude aviation sector and also a milestone in development of the low-altitude economy and urban air mobility, according to a report by the China Central Television (CCTV) on Sunday.  https:\/\/www.globaltimes.cn\/page\/202503\/1331146.shtml \u201cLow-altitude economy\u201d reduces travel and transport to a fraction of the time of traditional ground-transport\u2013 but these are meant to be complementry, not competetive; an extention of pre-existing transportation and logistic networks. As quickly as the Chinese move, I\u2019d say within 10-years we\u2019ll see drones fully integrated into Chinese cities as a mature technology. It would seem to make sense to first deploy this technology for freight service, and only after establishing a solid safety record move on to passenger service. Freight is happening now too\u2013 DHL in particular is very involved. We\u2019re also beginning to see widespread use of drones in agriculture. The company that makes these drones that are approved for passenger-carrying commercial operation, Ehang, is actually a software company that specializes in airspace management, but obviously these drones are what they will become known for. If you look at the licensing\/approval issued by the CAAC, you\u2019ll see that this is just a baby-step towards the widespread application of drone-tech\u2013 a lot more flight-hours, study, and refinement of regulations will need to take place before you see these operating within urban areas, and they are currently restricted from doing so. This is an opportunity for Mr Musk. The regulation of this new industry compels the distribution of  new constellations of low orbit satellites for control and regulation. See the latest decree by Mr Putin to Roscosmos about the Russian plans. A few terrorist attacks by drone in other countries will soon push them in the Russian direction. In a big city, there\u2019ll be more people at risk under the vehicle than in the vehicle. I do not know- but imagine, that there is very little private civilian aircraft and air traffic in China. Unmanned, managed flight in China seems possible and plausible if my assumption holds true.  That poo won\u2019t fly here in OOSA. Youotta see the number of private jets and helicopters bopping around SW Montana these days from Pied a Terre to Ranch. Enough to gag a maggot\u2026 Nope, can\u2019t and won\u2019t fly here\u2013 first, because the USA doesn\u2019t have the infrastructure to support autonomous air-taxis. And second, it\u2019s a Chinese product: if you thought weather balloons and Tik-Tok could send our congress-critters into a massive freak-out\u2026 [And you are correct about China\u2019s airspace: it\u2019s mostly a clean-slate] Yeah, it\u2019s huge for all the wrong reasons.  Shows China is just as clueless as the US in chasing \u201cthe great future of AI driven labor\u201d. At a time when such technology should be severely constrained due to our worsening climate issues, governments and their oligaric puppet masters continue down this doomed path. The only future AI has is too burn out our remaining resources and options faster than previously imagined. I feel like I\u2019ve read this post earlier. Yes, I\u2019ve posted on it before\u2013 yesterday it was a rumor, today it is news, and the Global Times updated it\u2019s article a few hours ago (see below). These Global Times updates are interesting in themselves as it seems that they are adding information in response to common questions that readers may have after reading the original article. I am absolutely fascinated by this tech, and by the impact that it will have on everyday life where it can be incorporated. It\u2019s also a tangible and highly-visible marker\u2013 code, software, and medicines don\u2019t photograph well\u2013 and provides a stark contrast between East and West, development of technology, it\u2019s acceptance, etc. From the GT update: \u201cIt is expected that trial applications will be conducted in designated areas to accumulate experience. Gradually, large-scale commercialization will begin with improvements in relevant standards and rules, as well as the establishment of flight service facilities,\u201d Luo noted. He estimated that it may take two to three years for big Chinese cities to fully embrace the low-altitude economy.  Earlier this month, Chinese authorities issued a special action plan to boost consumption. The guideline said that the government would speed up the supervision system for the low-altitude economy, and encourage the orderly development of low-altitude consumption, such as low-altitude tourism, air sports and consumer drones. According to Wang, the autonomous passenger drones OC is also the world\u2019s first, which could not only facilitate relevant Chinese companies\u2019 technological upgrades \u2013 a process that is closely tied to mass application \u2013 but would also help them gain a first-mover advantage in snapping up global market share. Luo also noted that China will be able to export its low-altitude economy model to the Belt and Road partner countries.  https:\/\/www.globaltimes.cn\/page\/202503\/1331193.shtml There was similar discussion earlier. I remember talk about safety of propeller blades, and drunk passengers, and whatnot. I have been fascinated by science and technology troughout my entire life (and engineering career). \u201cThis tech\u201d gets one big \u201cmeh\u201d from me. It\u2019s just a rehash, and yet another attempt at the old SF promise of flying cars (that people just can\u2019t get over, for some reason). Low-altitude this, low-altitude that, are bunch of buzzwords that should trigger an acid reflux in anyone with feet firmly on the ground. Adopting technology for the sake of adopting technology is not only wasteful, but can be counterproductive, and even dangerous. The other day there was an article about (dish)washing machine that does not work properly without Internet connection and a smartphone. High tech ineed, and it will have a lot of impact on everyday life where it is incorporated. What I find tangible, and highly-visible, and functional, and impressive, is high speed rail network Chinese built (and invested mucho dinero into). These multicopters are just for toying around, which is fine, as long as people don\u2019t get overly enthusiastic. Speaking about getting people overly enthusiastic on promises, it\u2019s funny that Elon Musk is not all over this thing. He could make it work, and by \u201cmake it work\u201d I mean make a lot of money. Here\u2019s something that he could invent and sell at a premium. :) https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PK202vTB0_U Drones will help China control the conquered US mainland after the next war, but hopefully they will also choose to build an extensive high speed rail network across the US to transport troops. I hadn\u2019t thought about it that way, but I really think you\u2019re on to something\u2026 think about all of the benefits a Chinese invasion and conquest of the USA can bring! What a list: good schools, elimination of poverty, cheap housing, responsive government\u2026 compared to what we have, Chinese-flavored communism might be a welcome change. China doesn\u2019t make the mistake of thinking in USian terms.  There won\u2019t be an invasion, way to expensive and would only cause a massive reaction. What for? They\u2019ll just wait for everything to fall apart and pick up the pieces that are still worth fixing.  It will be a long while still,  hope there will still be anyone alive by then.  (see the earlier link of blue ocean arctic up above) I am surprised that at this moment in time with US enabling the genocide in Gaza, creating the conditions for the Ukraine\/Russian war, bombing civilians in Yemen, Trump\u2019s electoral and subsequent \u201cregal\u201d rule, tariffs and tariff wars, etc. etc.. and as a Canadian it must be acknowledge Canada\u2019s role in much of what the US government is doing internationally, that little is being discussed along the lines of:  \u201cWhat am I driving at? At this idea: that no one colonizes innocently, that no one colonizes with impunity either; that a nation which colonizes, that a civilization which justifies colonization \u2014 and therefore force \u2014 is already a sick civilization, a civilization that is morally diseased, that irresistibly, progressing from one consequence to another, one repudiation to another, calls for its Hitler, I mean its punishment.\u201d Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire.  We have lived in neo-colonial times since 1945 and the US and G7 are now being punished as feral animals turn on each other.  Ginger Goodwin Yeah the utterly obliviousness to the implications of the infamous Signal chat plus the use of unmanned aircraft and how things will fall apart at the first crash suggests a sociopathic tendency to me. This is gonna go south very quickly. It\u2019s very dangerous to become an enemy of a great power, especially if that great power is your neighbour. This should be very obvious at this point. \u2026even if that great  power is your government?! Particularly when that great power is your government. \u2026a slippery sloppy slope Meeting up with our Calgarian cousins from the Gulag Heckeypelago in LA next month, and their visits to SoCal over many decades have always been routine and cordial, so as not to cause anybody to think that they are actually part of the espionage unit-aka Alberta Chinooks? I know nothing, nothing! Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire\u2019s essential statement is that American and I would say Canadian society is morally corrupt.  Referring to Hitler he is indicating that a real revolution has to take place for sanity to be restored internally and with regard to external relations between the US and the rest of the world.  Marx, Lenin, Trotsky, Mao, etc. said the same thing.  Times have changed since their insight and the world is at the abyss of something new, not fascism, but in the looking to Chile, Argentina, in the 60s and 70s are better indicators.  What was good for them, will be good for us is on the horizon.  It will be violent because those in power, politically, economically and culturally are not willing to give an inch.  I fear for my children and grandchildren now.  The present has never been so dark.  Ginger Goodwin Indeed!  You\u2019ll know the revolution is on when Tomorrow doesn\u2019t look like Today.  (SSA benefits should appear in member accounts on April 9, 2025. If not, expect tomorrow to be different than today. Or Not.) My last SSA deposit appeared 3\/26. So far so good. Direct link to Apple drags UK government to court over \u2018backdoor\u2019 order article at The Register. Our local elections are on 1st May.  Just saying, Do any of the younger cohorts remember the meaning of May Day? \u201cDOGE Plans to Rewrite Entire Social Security Codebase in Just \u2018a Few Months\u2019: Report\u201d  I\u2019ve got an idea. How about that to prove it safe, that Musk and his boy blunders go into JPMorgan Chase and completely change their code base out in only a few months and show everybody that they can do the job. I\u2019m sure that the people at  JPMorgan Chase would have full confidence in them to do this. If the results were not going to be so tragic about what Musk wants to do here and lead to who know how many people dying, it would be like the plot of a comedy film. Say, does anybody remember the spectacular success that Obama had with launching his Obamacare website? It will be like that but on steroids- https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/business\/healthcare-pharmaceuticals\/days-before-launch-obamacare-website-failed-to-handle-even-500-users-idUSBRE9AL03L\/ If this goes as bad as I think it will, I have a prediction. All that vandalism of Teslas and Tesla dealerships over the past few weeks? That will be absolutely nothing compared what will happen when Musk stuffs up. People may even burn down his factories this time. Worse. Insurance companies will refuse coverage to buildings and people. Then the banks will swoop in demanding their pound of flesh he promised as collateral. I was thinking about your comment and I think that you note something important. With this news of Musk wanting to experiment with all those social security computers, I would guess that any insurance company that has Tesla cars on their books would be having urgent meetings about what might be coming down the road in terms of potential payouts. Could it be that like certain areas in California, that insurance companies might give up insuring Teslas? Speaking as a former actuary,  YEP! On the other hand there are studies like this one described at Ars Technica: \u201cAfter 50 million miles, Waymos crash a lot less than human drivers.\u201d Of no use to Tesla.  Their FSD, a lie of the largest proportions, is among the worst autonomous driving packages in the industry.  Which considering how bad the \u201cbest\u201d ones are is saying something. California. Sorry if this sounds racist,  but I\u2019ve driven A LOT in USA and standards are blatantly below countries like UK where you must pass your driving test in a manual (stick) otherwise you get only a limited licence that doesn\u2019t allow you to drive stick. Can we compare Waymo to UK? Agreed.  I watch a YouTube channel that routinely mocks US drivers pulled over for drunk\/drink driving and similar stupidity.  The guy who runs the channel is Danish, and is routinely amazed at how light the penalties are and the overall low requirements for obtaining a license. Considering how often there is no public transportation available and how often the population is widely spread, it is an unspoken agreement that the tests and punishments are light. I am lucky to have public transportation in my area especially since I cannot drive until I get my cataract surgery; I have been trying since August and it looks like I might finally get my surgery done and my new glasses in May. That is nine months of repeated phone calls, referrals, and pushing.  When people say that things are slowing down in healthcare, they ain\u2019t kidding.   I live in the San Francisco Bay Area with its dense healthcare network and at least in some areas a halfway decent public transportation system.  However, even in California, there are areas where there is little of both.  Outside of the major metropolitan areas in the United States, I don\u2019t want to think about it. While yes, I don\u2019t think moving vehicle crashes was what The Rev was implying insurers would get antsy about. Yes. The concern is over vigilante torching. (The administrators at my local community college are placing masking tape over their Tesla insiginia\u2019s.) Interesting, but that won\u2019t do any good.  If someone can\u2019t tell a Tesla from any other car, they aren\u2019t trying. I thought juno mas was making a sly and very funny administrator joke\u2026 I have seen a video of a Cybertruck with TOYOTA written on the back of it. :) It\u2019s not necessary to burn anything down.  Just need a few thousand people to spend a few weeks around the perimeter keeping people and things from going in and out.  Why risk all the toxic fumes?  Turn it into a party with music and shared food etc.   My husband is in despair because he hasn\u2019t learned yet what activism requires.  As someone else put it \u201cYou lose you lose you lose you lose you keep losing then they give up\u201d.  Keep losing! They won\u2019t be able to do it in a few months.  This is simply not a realistic timeline in this universe.  Banks and governments the world over still have COBOL mainframes despite multiple attempts to convert them to more modern languages.  The challenges are very real.  They won\u2019t be able to replicate the transactional efficiency or speed of COBOL.  They\u2019ll run into the problem of interdependencies of legacy systems, you can\u2019t convert one aspect without also fixing all at once.  There are certain unique aspects about COBOL as a language which no modern programming language has, which is precisely the challenge, and it doesn\u2019t use databases in the modern sense, uses a file based system.  COBOL was created when there was no such thing as relational\/transactional databases or even spreadsheets.   My prediction is two months will pass, then 6, then 12.  Then they will either quietly bury it, or would make small progress in probably a year or two and call that an overhaul.  After all, who would know the difference?  If they haven\u2019t made progress they won\u2019t go live with it, won\u2019t release.  They\u2019ll realize it\u2019s too big a risk.   Sadly, because I do like the idea of revolt. Oh, no, you REALLY do not get it. The point is for them to wreck the system so as to have no Social Security. The coding is just a pretext. The French peasants burned land records in the Revolution. This is a similar but counterrevolutionary approach. I do agree that with most of Doge\u2019s effort is really to just wreck things but could this effort with SS just be attributed to stupidity on a galactic scale? I mean do they really want the wrath of most of the Nation\u2019s populace raining down on them? It\u2019s not like they can say \u201cOops, sorry about that\u201d,in this instance when it goes bad. And it\u2019ll be almost instantaneous when automatic deposits stop coming in. I suppose I just can\u2019t wrap my head around some things that are so ridiculous\u2026 When you integrate the idea into your thinking that, to these people, Terran human life is less important than power and profit, it all becomes clear. All of the dead people who formerly relied on the social safety nets are a feature of the process, not a bug in it. just be attributed to stupidity on a galactic scale? Porque no los dos? I\u2019m not so sure about the wrath. I think USians might be so shell-shocked and atomized already that even the demise\/deliberate destruction of SS (of which I partake at age 74) may land like a nothingburger, save for expressions of aghastitude from some of the usual suspects. Having grifting privateers come to \u201csave\u201d us recipients of what remains of our well-earned gubmint retirement fund will be spun as one more miracle of the invisible hands that guide us all, and may be part of the script. Just to underline this, by shutting a bunch of offices and making it harder to complain, they are banking that some chunk of people on the margin give up. They then pocket the difference as \u201csavings\u201d. Well trod path in the insurance industry. The added bonus is proving that the gov can\u2019t be trusted with social security over time, and instead, it should be issued through Twitter payments (or whatever). Also, there\u2019s not a clear path to solidarity, which means that if they continue to find ways isolate people and make them feel like the errors are partially their own fault, people don\u2019t fight back as a block. Thank you for continuing to boost this story, Yves. It\u2019s as important as the Treasury payment systems beat, imo. Sorry to disagree but the Nation\u2019s populace will be able to get over it in a matter of weeks being that most of these people are retired or disabled people.  Just look at the people right now, they\u2019re looking at others to carry the load. We\u2019ve  been trained to take s#*^ our entire lives, and now with the empire contracting, we\u2019re being trained to eat it. And we will\u2026 and if there are complaints that become excessive, the Blackwater types will called in to discipline the rabble. >the Blackwater types will called in to discipline the rabble. It\u2019s a mighty big country out there with a lot of space with a lot of people owning their own weapons. Maybe controlling people in densely populated areas like cities will work but good luck out in the hinterlands. Ok, let\u2019s stipulate for the sake of argument that Musk and Trump want to break SS.  Even assuming malignant intent, I struggle to see how they would do it. What you suggest is that this government system is vulnerable to this kind of purposeful meddling. If government controls over key critical systems aren\u2019t at least as stringent as, say, trading platforms, or a smalltimey bank, then the US is done for and not because of Trump or Musk.   However, the modern development process is such that no matter what you code, you use versioning systems and work in releases, and each version or subversion has commits, branches, tags.  So if something breaks, you then revert to an earlier version of the codebase.   Nothing Musk can do here can\u2019t be reversed or undone.   There is also code review.  And various levels of signoff.  And various stages of testing.  And, if you\u2019re the US government, you also have the NSA performing audits and code review because this is National Security, after all, and these systems are protected and classified.  You\u2019re not introducing bad code without the NSA signing off on it, and if they sign off on it, well then\u2026. My take is this is likely just Musk using FUD to successfully induce freakout mode in his detractors. You are talking past the premise that Musk & Co are saboteurs. If you assume that, let\u2019s start with \u201cWho needs the backup tapes?\u201d Protip:  get a hard copy of your SSA benefit statement and out it in a safe place.  It is advice I am giving to my clients. That hardcopy was mailed to all SS recipients at the end of January 2025 so they could submit their 2024 annual income tax statement.  Should be handy. I just got my benefits statement sitting on my desk. On wrecking Social Security, I understand the goal, as it has been a goal of Wall Street to take over the system for decades.  However, over a fifth of Americans depend directly, if not exclusively, on it for survival with most of them either having paid into it decades or are so disabled it is almost impossible to claim them as moochers.  This means a sudden collapse in the system would instantly crush most of the economy and it would be impossible to successfully blame the victims for their suffering. One could argue that Americans are too atomized or hateful to fight back, but a fifth of the entire population would face homelessness and\/or starvation in a single month across the entire country and all classes up to the upper middle class.  It would be a different situation if the government was perceived to be making an honest mistake and was genuinely concerned and competent, or if the economy was fantastic, but since that is not true even in \u00fcber Blue California, the Trump Administration is playing a game of sudden death.  It is so far beyond incompetence, carelessness, a lack of intelligence or even ruthlessness as to genuine madness. But I am not seeing any real connections to reality among our ruling elites. Add to that fifth of the population who would be directly harmed by loss of Social Security benefits, the children,  relatives and service organizations who would be called on to replace at least part of the lost benefits and you could have a very large part of the country angry enough to act. They did it by making the single worst strategic mistake that any software company can make: They decided to rewrite the code from scratch. Things You Should Never Do, Part I; Joel Sposky; April 2000 Oh wow, I used to follow Joel\u2019s blog around the time of that post.  I had forgotten about it, thank you! What could possibly go wrong? Are they converting the test routines as well?  I did an IT job once for a TBTF bank that required a database column to be a few bytes wider for expanded text. The client required two months of testing to get it into production. Sigh.  AP continues to lie, or repeat UK propaganda. There is virtually nothing left of the Kursk incursion \u2026 Watching Dima it\u2019s down to a few fields and a hamlet. Even Deep State maps show that ouster is nearly completed. Yet AP claims only \u201c80% retaken.\u201d  Why do they lie so much? Maybe because they know that CNN, the BBC, DW, MSN, etc. will never contradict them. Because there are no negative personal consequences to the people ordering or doing the lying. In fact, the opposite might be true. Financial distress commentary, embed I now notice is somewhat dated but I suggest still overall accurate.  Varied classes of many stripes and not just the lesser classes or the poors, still grappling with the inflation genie that won\u2019t go back in the bottle. Zeitgeist watch from yesterday, a very quick sojourn into the local Walmart.   Only went into buy a few textile items for the bathroom, which I just observed were made in India.

Denmark is part of NATO. We\u2019re bound to defend each other, and we have every ability to defend our interests without an absurd and unlawful annexation.\u2019 JD Vance went on a rant while in Greenland saying that Denmark was not doing a good job of defending Greenland against the looming Chinese and Russian and Iranian invasion fleets about to land and that they were failing. Maybe Denmark should call Vance\u2019s bluff. They should announce that they are pulling any men and officers serving with NATO and sending them to Greenland to defend that island on behalf of NATO. All officers & personnel will have till the end of the week to hand over their work and clear their desks and computer files. And that they will not up their NATO payments like Trump demanded as any extra money will be used for that force defending that island. Bonus points as a force like that might block any ideas about having the US seize that island\u2019s civil administration. In any case, the US signed a treaty where they acknowledged that Greenland belongs to Denmark in exchange for the US buying the Dutch West Indies. Surely the US would never renege on a treaty, right? https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Treaty_of_the_Danish_West_Indies >>>Surely the US would never renege on a treaty, right?

That article quoted extensively from Rosstat and other Russian official sources. It highlighted the fact that truck drivers were now earning four times what they made before the war and how Russia\u2019s lower classes did especially well under conditions of full employment that even penetrated to the one-factory towns that languished as from the Yeltsin years of the mid-1990s when that factory shut its doors. Considering that over-all the FT is notoriously anti-Putin, anti-Russian that one article was something to celebrate. Now in today\u2019s online edition of the FT we find another feature article entitled \u2018Russia\u2019s war economy fuels rustbelt revival\u201d that is more focused geographically in long deprived regions and focused topically on the consumer sector of goods and services. See https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/559ca59f-7fdc-4c47-8e87-edb562acdc7b \u201d FT would be here: https:\/\/archive.is\/YtWw8 final paragraphs: \u201cThe lead author of this article, Daria Mosolova, is a relatively recent hire. Her LinkedIn entry tells us that she got her bachelor\u2019s degree in comparative literature (French) at University College London and then took an advanced degree in international relations at the London School of Economics. While at LCU, she was for one year editor in chief of Pi Media, which is their student journalism society. Mosolova joined the FT in 2022 as a trainee and is in rotating 6-month assignments to various FT desks. She served one term in Brussels and now is based in London, assisting with Russia coverage in the area of economics and business. It will be interesting to see how long Mosolova remains at the FT. But she likely has a promising career ahead of her if the editors have tolerated her dollop of truth amidst their general Russia-bashing.\u201d Might the author or her parents be a Russian immigrants to the UK? Her surname certainly looks and sounds like they might have come from there. Go East, young man. Been saying this for years to the kids I used to work with in house unaffordable Massachusetts. Most said nothing a few said Russia is a poor nation. My shift in view towards Russian prosperity was partly due to Doctorow\u2019s accounts of shopping and Duches in Russia. be careful this isn\u2019t meant to show us the way. A War with Iran will be great for the Rust Belt! As tmann says, might they be providing evidence that war is good for the business economy? Advocating a govt job guarantee is a tenant  of Kelton\u2019s MMT. The ruble is a sovereign currency and any Russian deficit spending will accrue to the privet sector. War is pretty much a business. \u201c\u2026the privet sector.\u201d The Russian version of hedge funds? A second Doctorow has hit the blogosphere Re: Child labor in FL Actually this may be good, it shows people that their standard of living requires child labor or slaves. Team R delivering as promised: \u201cwe got rid of the brown underclass, now we will need your children please.\u201d Perhaps a wake up call. The child labor will be by brown people and only a few similarly poor whites. To your comment I get the horrible feeling that there will be more than enough poor whites in the near future.  I mean there is value to kids doing a little  work and chores but within the realm of earning  some cash in their pocket, learning responsibilities and skills but not a return to what\u2019s below. https:\/\/www.historyplace.com\/unitedstates\/childlabor\/index.html Well, maybe as manufacturing is brought back at least the new factories will be a little cleaner and safer\u2026 We poor whites harvested crops in a prior era and that paid for school clothes and some even afforded bicycles. There was camaradie and someone always had an AM radio for musical diversion. That started at age 12 and went on for years. Same here.

This led to 9 months of cleaning police cars for community service Forget about underage kids working, how come I never see 16-18 year olds working-as was the custom when I was in high school. Most students didn\u2019t work, but plenty did, selling shoes at Thom McAnn or working at McDonalds or somewhere else in the mall I never lifted a finger other than to be a numismatist\u2019s apprentice when I was 15 pushing old metal. The demographic changes do indicate it will be mostly brown people. If the social contract programs were hated by the elite before, since the anger at the New Deal, they see now as a most opportune time to pull up all ladders. \u201cwe got rid of the brown underclass, now we will need your children please.\u201d You left off a sentence in quote?! \u201cwe got rid of the brown underclass, now we will need your children please. Now, Go Die!\u201d \u2018Hey, your child got it\u2019s arm mangled in the machinery at the factory today and now we want you to pay for the down-time as we had to stop the line to get the machinery clean again.\u2019 If that sounds dark, children were frequently mangled in the machinery of the 19th century factory mills where they had to duck in and clean out gunk while the machines were still working. Phhff, still happens today. Just a fine by OSHA. Just the cost of doing business.

Yeah, I knew Robeson\u2019s shift on it.   :-| \u201cAre there no workhouses? Are there no prisons?\u201d Florida \u2014 making the world safe again for Victorian era working conditions p.s. speculative question:  If countries train their population for long wartime production such as during WWI\/II does that training\/focus pay off in the post-war development?  e.g. did Germany\u00b4s post-1945 rise profit of that? Or rather not? May be USA did?  The bigger question being probably in how far the institutionalisation of war-related R&D, education and production may benefit a society\/economy. And with this of course:  What to expect from Germany\u00b4s intended course for war economy. Critics say arms industry makes little sense because it\u00b4s concept of profit is one-dimensional. Once the tank is destroyed it\u00b4s worthless. And if it is not being used it again is worthless in the long-term causing insane costs and being very ineffective for the broader society and its needs. I assume by wartime production you also mean a wartime economy similar to WWII at least in terms of prioritization of the war effort? If so, the neoliberal West will fare very poorly and any such attempt will most likely hasten an economic collapse. There is a reason countries like Russia and China can and could (respectively) handle such a shift. I bought a couple complete runs of 1943 and 1944 National Geographics at a yard sale eons ago and got around to finally looking at them, and the adverts are all oriented towards the war and many of the articles as well. In 1942 rationing started and no civilian cars were made for the duration of the war, and many of the ads say something along the lines of \u2018when the war is over, you can expect blah blah in consumer goods, etc.\u2019 In contrast, we were told to go out and shop our hearts out after 9\/11, and have experienced no lack of anything since-save occasional toilet paper runs early in Covid. There was a wonderful fold-out map of the southwest in a NG from around 1941 or so. Many of the routes shown are no longer on maps today. The roads are still there of course. I used it to drive over the Chuska mountain range in about 1988. I think it might be paved now but it was a dirt road then. >\u201dThere is a reason countries like Russia and China can and could (respectively) handle such a shift.\u201d The question of course what are the differences between EU and RU\/CHINA for latters\u00b4 ability to handle it. We have such factors as control over necessary resources which EU does not own on the level necessary. Or the much discussed inefficiency of the Western MIC-production which has been turned into a scam, to rip off a country\u00b4s wealth instead of producing goods that fulfill their task for a fraction of the cost. But this unlike natural resources can be changed. Another could be the disunity among Europeans on arms manufacturers and their inability to agreeing on one particular design. But not in all areas this is true. Airbus for reasons others here can judge unlike me, sort of worked out. \u201ccan be changed\u201c. Except the war talk is being driven by financial pressures, not the other way around.  Also \u2013 while probably sufficient, the profit and grift motive in the MIC is not the only factor at play.  To be efficient at the Russian \/ Chinese level, the labor base would need to not pay for Big Pharma \/ Medical insurance profits, Big Finance interest payments on housing and credit cards, Big Ag profits on food distribution, etc etc. Well, naively spoken by me \u2013 addressing a factor that is potentially under EU elite\u00b4s control. If of interest for that same elite is an entirely different matter as you suggest. In how far do the efficiency issue of arms production and living-costs for the population relate? Seymour Melman (After Capitalism) thinks than in US, there was a tradeoff between excellence in military R&D and excellence in development of civilian industrial base. (Only so many engineers produced by the educational system; he also thinks that the emphasis on  military industries damaged management style, since with the adopted \u201ccost-plus\u201d procurement schemes, there was little incentive for the military industry managers to worry about improving the productivity of defense industrial designs and processes). SM thinks that US adopted an explicit policy of out-sourcing civilian industrial base development (his index case is \u201cmachine tools\u201d) to other countries and focused its resources on defense technology development. In the end, this negatively impacted even the defense industrial base, as we see now in the West. I read accounts about how wartime mobilization trained both workers and management to operate effectively in large organizations.  These pertained specifically to Japan after WW2 and South Korea after the Korean War, but no reason to think it wasn\u2019t universal.   If so, could US have become the giant industrial power without the Civil War? Was the British \u201cmalaise\u201d (that is, how it fell behind Germany) due to Britain being the only industrial country that didn\u2019t have a conscription based army at any time in latter half of 19th century?  Idle speculation on my part and probably something likely full of holes once you look at the details, I\u2019m sure.  But the social spillover effects from conscription and mass army has to be considerable. The Union states of the northeast US were well along the way to industrialization by the start of the War Between the States. Some of it was protective tariffs, some of it the US already enjoyed immigration surpluses. Tariffs protecting the north\u2019s industrial development were mainly against Britain who were the cotton sellers\u2019 big customer.  Thus during Jackson\u2019s presidency there was nullification by South Carolina and its constitutional crisis. Perception that the federals were favoring the north were slightly less than the realization that Lincoln would finally shutter slave state creation\u2026\u2026 reasons for secession. I suggest the \u201cfalse claims act\u201d in federal law goes back to the cheating on the Union purchasing officers during the War. Not that anyone pursues false claims these days. I think you are referring to Edwards Deming\u2019s work that shifts quality control and process innovation to the line workers. It was very successful in WW2 manufacturing in the US but after the war the US returned to a traditional hierarchical system  where workers just did what they were told. After the war Japan manufacturing embraced Deming\u2019s philosophy that became Kaizen and is the reason Toyota\u2019s are much better cars then Fords. Fun fact. Demming was bought over to Japan at the behest of MacArthur, Shogun of Japan 1945-1951. Ukrainians expect Russia to launch a fresh offensive to strengthen its negotiating position AP I expect Russia to launch a fresh offensive, because that\u2019s what armies fighting wars do (espetially after rasputitsa ends). I\u2019m convinced that the neocons whole approach to \u201cending\u201d wars suffers from projection.  Unlike our adversaries we have long ago forgotten what it is like to actually win a war to end it.  Since WW2 we have adopted the \u201ccut and run\u201d option without exception and so expect that everyone else has also done so.  The Russians and other of our enemies seem to have remembered that there is another option.  It always interests me when the brainiacs write that virtually all wars end with negotiation because by and large those wars were also virtually always started by the US and cutting and running certainly is our go to alternative.  Kind of a self fulfilling prophecy. Except that the US foreign policy seems to have pioneered the \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d philosophy after Vietnam, and is now applying it vigorously at home and abroad. Sowing chaos is what we do. Because it\u2019s so much easier than actually building stuff. If we can\u2019t \u201cwin\u201d, nobody can. Nihilism rules. But at least the squillionaires get to keep their stuff. For now. Because \u201cwinning\u201d means having to own the aftermath.  We \u201cwon\u201d the Civil War in 1865, only to give up, cut, and run 12 years later, because the aftermath turned out to be too messy.  Yes, this is somewhat tongue in cheek, but the lessons are still applicable. If we couldn\u2019t invest a generation or two to make a complete victory out of a war that took place in US soil, that cost 600,000 American lives, why should we spend so much for a \u201cvictory\u201d in faraway places? It\u2019s what\u2019s known as the \u201cpigeon maneuver\u201d in chess: shit on the board, declare victory, and fly away. That is exactly what Putin said of Obama in more or less those words. The other difference is that the Russians are fighting right next door, not 6000 miles or more away, let alone across an ocean. USians seem unable to grasp this, either in motivational nor logistical terms. Russian forces have maintained strong pressure through the winter. Good weather and dry roads\u2026..

In terms of Big Brother and the holding company having the goods on us via our handhelds, my soon to be late mom was in the hospital and not doing so well, and my sisters and I were discussing her wishes to be cremated should she pass away\u2026 and then I glanced at my eavesdropper and tho and behold was an ad for cremation services on it~ Yikes Oh yes. That\u2019s why I do not carry the phone, a flip phone, Dinosaur Senior Brand, anywhere except for daytrips. (Even then it\u2019s usually in a Faraday pouch.) The same, curious, synchronicity happens to us on our desktop computer. Fun thought experiment.

Mailed a check from Tiny Town to one of the Dartful Codgers in San Diego, and I had to do a stop payment on it after 10 days, worried about potential theft and altering, etc. He tells me now it just arrived on the 11th day.  According to the Google, that\u2019s 342.8 miles The distance for a letter to get from St Joseph Missouri to Sacramento is 1,667 miles and they got \u2018R done in 10 days time, 165 years ago. USians have been spoiled by the traditional service levels of the Post Office.  One of the big surprises moving north of the border was how long Canada Post routinely took to get a letter across the city. (measured in weeks, not days.   Admittedly, our reference point was in the before times) I came to Canad from Scotland in the .60\u2019s I could mail a letter to my Mum on Monday and get a reply the following Monday\u2026..those days are long gone now\u2026takes 2 weeks to just get to scotland I sometimes buy board games from people on Boardgame Geek. Shipping prices have become a lot higher in the last few years but those from Canada are so bad that any Canadian seller is automatically excluded from my searching nowadays. If you were a pony ( or a person) leaving St. Joe (I grew up close to there), you\u2019d be amazed you can gallop (or run). I was sending checks to Tucson AZ every month for about two years.  (From the Portland OR metro area.)  Between 2021 and 2023?  Because of how long it was taking, I wound up sending them by certified mail.  Certified mail gives you a tracking number so you can use the USPS web site to see where it is.  I also made sure to mail 15 days *before* they were due. The longest it took was over 17 days.  I remember it sitting \u201cin transit\u201d according to the USPS website for 15 days. During that time, I do not recall any of the CM pieces making it to Tucson in the 4 to 5 day USPS delivery window[1].  The USPS site has a map that will show the zones that will be traversed by your piece of mail from source to destination. I have also noticed a big push by phone, credit card, health, people to move to electronic statements and payments.  I have not done so.  Along with this, the bills are arriving much closer to the due date.  Probably to *help* me make up my mind to switch.  So I usually cut the check and mail within a day or two of getting the bill.  Even then it can be very close to the due date before I see the check clear\u2026 USPS \u2013 Used to be rock solid.  After privitization, when they make it *more efficient*, things are going to get interesting.  I\u2019d expect mail delivery to be cut to once or twice a week.  Along with guaranteed delivery times to be extended by quite a bit.  If you want it fast just pay FedEx $50 for delivery of your letter. 1 \u2013 This is what I remember the USPS time was supposed to be from their map. If the US Postal Service ever got privatized, expect large swathes of country post offices to be closed as being \u201cuneconomical.\u201d And if challenged about this, they would reply \u2018Hey, we\u2019re a business now, not a charity.\u2019 BrianC, barring a miracle today, I\u2019m going to break your \u201cin transit\u201d record. Mailed a REGISTERED letter from Italy on Feb. 27 that \u201cDeparted USPS Regional Facility ORLANDO FL DISTRIBUTION CENTER\u201d on March 11 and has been \u201cMoving Through Network In Transit to Next Facility\u201d since March 14. That\u2019s 15 days and counting. Destination: NC Dept. of Revenue, Raleigh NC, a 9-hour drive from Orlando. By comparison, it only took a week to get from Italy to NYC customs processing. Why a registered letter? I\u2019ve already seen twice that USPS tracking for the Italian version of certified international mail goes blind just before delivery. And because the NCDOR\u2019s e-pay web site won\u2019t accept a foreign payee address for a domestic US bank payment. Same barrier to reporting the issue via the USPS \u201cmissing mail\u201d site. Crapification all around, old mechanisms and new.  Like you, I conclude that FedEx (or DHL) is the only alternative \u2014 but you\u2019re out of luck if the only delivery address is a PO box! re Peter St Onge\u2019s remark: A new study finds 2\/3 of Middle Class Americans are struggling financially, with half living paycheck-to-paycheck. Of the 2\/3 struggling I bet that there is a subset of these folks who are college grads with outstanding loans that may face a further sting to meeting basic needs.   Scanning WashExaminer, found the following: \u201cWhen the COVID-19-era pause on federal student loan payments ended in September 2023, the Biden administration introduced a 12-month \u201con-ramp\u201d to help borrowers transition back to repayment.

Coincidentally, today El Pais published an op-ed signed by Antonio Scurati in the same vein of those supposed \u201cpro-european\u201d, so-called \u201cliberals\u201d, described in Jacobin\u2019s article, which joins a series of \u201cpro-european\u201d Op-eds authored by Spanish columnists calling for a sense of European patriotism, as the only thing left sane in this crazy world.  This Scurati starts calling Trump traitor, traitor! with a naivet\u00e9 which I cannot see clearly if it is planned or real. Do these people really feel betrayed or this is only a PR  instrument to justify the unjustifiable by outraging the masses? I bet on the second. But this will be counterproductive. The populaces will be outraged by the ineptitude of these new \u201cpro europeans\u201d and the accompanying social cuts associated with the newest re-birth of Neoliberal policies. I was scratching my head about what countries complex PIIGS. One effect of giving up Guiness stout for Lent! PIIGS = Germany, Latvia, Findland, The Netherlands and Poland, if I recall correctly. One thing this Scurati gets right is that there aren\u2019t enough warriors in Europe to fight the kind of war being played in Ukraine. He is calling for conscription, conscription! PIIGS= Portugal, Italy, (Ireland), Greece, Spain. Years ago, here at NC, i noted how stupid that acronym was and i got agreement on that. It was indeed symptomatic about a self perceived sense of superiority of some and now we are seeing who the real PIGS are (hope the actual piggies forgive me), though there are still some unable to come to the realization. That is why i mixed the countries as my way to stating, once again, how stupid is that acronym. Ignacio: The PIIGS are Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain. Antonio Scurati has plenty of egg on his face for his intemperate comments at the demo in Roma sponsored by Michele Serra and Repubblica (and paid for by the Comune di Roma, city hall, which costs are now being investigated and contested). Scurati wrote the trilogy \u201cM\u201d about Mussolini, and a streaming series was made from his books. Presumably, he doesn\u2019t write in Castillian. What is the source of the warmongering remarks? Conscription? Because the Italians aren\u2019t bellicose enough?  Send Pina Picierno! She\u2019s an out-and-out guerrafondaia. I was hoping you would get the irony in my reply. Ignacio: Sorry for being literal-minded. Two reasons: I enjoy being  a PIIGS.  Second, I went this morning, in spite of the dawn of l\u2019ora legale, to a special screening of No Other Land. Which I recommend. The film can seem somehow monotonous, but the monotony is the banality of evil \u2014 the Israelis showing up again and again to victimize the villagers. Before the showing, though, there was a special guest, a local historian \/ essayist who writes much too much for La Stampa, who gave that Official European View. At a certain point, thirty or so minutes into the endless psychologizing, I wanted to get up and say, \u201cBasta! Enough with the psychology and platitudes about the what you call an insoluble situation.\u201d  Forty-five minutes of introduction to the film, in which said dignitary talked about the mutual hatred of Palestinians and Israelis. Does the word \u201chatred\u201d come up in No Other Land? No.  Which is why my patience is exceedingly thin today for people like Antonio Scurati and Domenico Quirico. [Abbracci malgrado tutto, as I sign off these days. Maybe I\u2019m just a clock-change zombie today.] You are forbidden absolutely. When i read \u201cPIIGS\u201d in a Reality Czar context i am certain it is not the same as in let\u2019s say, a Financial Times context. You have bula papal on this issue.;) The \u201cpsychologizing\u201d is indeed the worst part. Often followed by the statement that people are not biased when laying out their quid-pro-quo argumentation as if the PLO were the biggest recipient of US military aid after Israel and there were F-35s with the flag of Palestine thundering across the Golan Heights. How do you see the reactions in Italy to the film? According to boxofficemojo in Europe box office was highest in Italy with $372,471. Scurati doesn\u2019t call explicitly for conscription though asking were our warriors are and how we would need them to fight the Evil is basically the same. He probably wrote that in Italian and was translated by El Pais (this and a few articles before). He signs the article. If he has a son in \u201cfighting age\u201d would he like him sent to fight for democracy and values in Ukraine? We are not people who invade neighboring countries; we are not people who bomb and raze cities to the ground; we do not massacre and torture civilians with sadistic pleasure; we do not kidnap children and deport them to use them as ransom.

I expect things to get much more chaotic as the year progresses, with Societal collapse more likely than not. One thing I don\u2019t see mentioned often in these scenarios is Dogs. I have lived through several economic downturns and one thing I have observed is people abandoning their Dogs when they can no longer afford to care for them. Usually in rural areas,  often not far from cities. The Dogs that do not starve, pack. And they have no fear of Humans. >>>And they have no fear of Humans. Of course they don\u2019t.  We have spent twelve thousand years, if not thousands longer, breeding that fear out of them.

EVERYONE FIGHTS. NO ONE QUITS. re: China Aims To Operate World\u2019s First Hybrid Fusion-Fission Nuclear Plant By 2030 Any thoughts? Last time I think commentariat was skeptical on this issue and on what the news really meant. Not an expert, but the article says they\u2019re using a blanket of fissionable materials to capture the fusion generated high energy neutrons.   On the one hand, that might be an efficient way to convert the neutrons to heat to power a conventional steam turbine.  On the other, one of the main selling points of fusion was how relatively clean it can be in terms of radioactive waste.   This might be good economically during it\u2019s service life, but also as expensive as a conventional fission nuke to decommission.   Maybe they\u2019ve identified a relatively \u2018clean\u2019 fission reaction, with short lived waste elements. Maybe not. This was always, always the nightmare scenario for fusion, going back 60 years: build a fusion reactor 1.0 as a fissile material breeder reactor for nuclear power and nuclear weapons (there is not enough uranium in the world for fission reactors to scale as a dominant energy source), then don\u2019t bother  trying to build the fusion 2.0 that everybody said the whole point of this 60 year research exercise, because 1.0 is already so expensive and it\u2019s taken  so long. Fusion 2.0 is the jetpack of the 21st century. It is genuinely creepy to see this scenario playing out. I don\u2019t have enough expertise in this area to comment with authority, but it\u2019s an interesting take on the fusion \u201cfirst wall\u201d problem. How do you put a sun in a bottle, and how do you extract the energy and convert it to electricity? Plasma-facing material https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Plasma-facing_material They are doing the very hard work of making progress with very real things. This also is extremely impressive: China\u2019s Thorium Nuclear Reactor: A Game-Changing Energy Breakthrough! https:\/\/engineerine.com\/chinas-thorium-nuclear-reactor-energy-breakthrough\/ Research of this type in America (which we once lead) has seemed to have devolved to \u201cdrill, baby drill\u201d which is certainly a much lower risk, and certainly a huge money maker for the oil companies, but when success does come, it\u2019s going to be big. The US National Ignition Facility mentioned in the article started out way back as a potential fusion power prototype, but has become a means to test aspects of the US nuke stockpile \u2013 no power generation in it\u2019s future: National Ignition Facility https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/National_Ignition_Facility Stockpile stewardship https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stockpile_stewardship And these efforts are all part of the National Nuclear Security Administration which got whacked by DOGE firings.It doesn\u2019t look as if American elites care about this type of research any more which is very unfortunate. Glen, you have the causal arrow backwards. Lawrence Livermore has always been a nuclear weapons lab. The National Ignition Facility is essentially repurposing their existing testbed for modeling nuclear weapons, so that they can  pimp for more funding. That\u2019s it. Thanks to fundamental physics, it is a non-starter as a scalable approach to civilian fusion power plants, ever. I\u2019m well aware that LLNL was started by Teller to make the \u201csuper\u201d (H bomb), but the NIF was originally started as the Shiva laser facility to test inertial confinement fusion: Shiva laser https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Shiva_laser By then fusion had been a project running at LLNL in one form or another almost since the inception of the lab: Project Sherwood and magnetic fusion https:\/\/st.llnl.gov\/news\/look-back\/project-sherwood-and-magnetic-fusion So I don\u2019t dispute that LLNL was first and foremost about bombs, but I don\u2019t think the public was aware of just how much work was being done in the fusion reactor area (it was classified for decades) just as most Americans remain unaware that America built and ran a prototype thorium reactor in the 1960\u2019s: Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Molten-Salt_Reactor_Experiment It\u2019s as if once the national labs (which had been founded for weapons \u2013 no debating that) got too far out of building bombs they just walked away from doing the work. But it was never really picked up and followed thru. Perhaps they figured the PWR was all that was required. This is similar to the end of the Cold War peace dividend which never materialized. The DOD budget is now larger than ever. So too with nuclear weapons, we\u2019re in a new nuke weapons race whether people realize it or not (although I doubt that China\u2019s hybrid reactor is to make bomb material, just look up the history of Hanford and Savannah River to see how that\u2019s been done), and the peace dividend that was possible has never been done (at least in America).  Let\u2019s be blunt, Silicon Valley and all it created (until it enshitified in to Silly Con Valley) happened as a commercial spin off from America\u2019s DOD need to develop ICBMs and spy satellites. It\u2019s how we can sit here and have these on line discussions. But the peace dividend from the Manhattan project seems to have sputtered out. It looks like China is taking up the mantle of progress that America dropped.

We went to the Wal-Mart for toothpaste that was somehow forgotten, and some legal pads.  In the Wal-Mart, immediately upon entering the door, the cops had 4 young men handcuffed and sitting on the floor.  We went back to the pharmacy area, only to discover that all of the merchandise there is behind lock and key.  There was already a huge line for the one lone person to help.  There were no legal pads to be found in the Wal-Mart.  Those shelves appeared to be bare.  An entire section for office supplies, and there were no obvious pens or pencils, but lots of very expensive packs of Sharpies.  Tons of empty shelves where paper, construction paper, glue, tape etc used to be.  We were looking for some kind of DVD to play on the way home, no luck.  Every single shelf in the entire electronics section under lock and key, and after 10 minutes, not an employee to be seen. Last night, we went driving around, and I honestly do not recall the driving to be so crazy, when we left the big city less than a decade ago.  We do not eat out much in our little area, so I was literally mortified at the prices of everything here \u2013 7 dollars for a cup of coffee in a breakfast diner, etc.  We have witnessed two episodes of shoplifting at convenience stores, and this morning while in the diner, there appeared to be people leaving without paying the bill.   My kids got to witness a felony in progress in the parking lot.   I noted with some disgust, that ordering any kind of food in kiosks in hotels, etc, in this case an Einstein Bagel store,  is now just a horrendous ordeal.  The place was obviously severely understaffed.  The line to order was very long \u2013 and it appears to me that most of the people were trying to \u201cStarbucks\u201d their orders.  In other words \u2013 \u201cI know it says Asiago cheese on the menu \u2013 but we want a combination of Pepper Jack and Cheddar.  Please take all the egg yolks out of the eggs, and we do not want the bacon very crisp, etc.\u201d  My elder family members that ran restaurants back in the day would have told them to take a hike.  Instead, who was taking the hike were the multiple paying customers at the very end of the line.  And the thing is ALL of the kiosks were just like this.  We have been to multiple gas stations and convenience stores where there were just homeless people everywhere.  Unfortunately as a physician with decades of inner city medicine behind my belt,  I can tell instantly how deeply suffering they were.  My kids offered bananas and mandarins from our bag to each and every person huddled around the ice machines.  They all refused any fruit.  An even worse sign. I have looked in vain every day we are here for a local paper in the convenience store or gas station.  Nowhere to be found is any kind of newspaper. I feel like Rip Van Winkle.  Instead of time like it was for Rip, it is time AND place for me.  We are approaching about a decade being gone from urban areas as a lifestyle, and when we go back now, I feel like I am on an alien planet.  It is striking to me how different it is.  And it has made me wonder all day if the people who live there are like frogs boiling in hot water.   They are so used to it, that it is everyday life for them. Dare we guess which city this was? I\u2019ve encountered the Walmart drug shelf thing even here in small city Bible belt. So it\u2019s not just the big bad coastals. It all seems to be a sign of the times even if it\u2019s up for debate just what that sign is. I knew people who were stealing stuff like televisions and mailing the bill to the Sears before the company went under because they couldn\u2019t find anyone to buy it from.  Around the same time, I was working at a different department chain where we got a lot of complaints from corporate about customer complaints, lack of sales, and increased shrinkage.  This was after they had reduced the number of sales staff to five employees for a store with two stories and ten departments, which they eventually closed for lack of sales even though it was still making a profit. This was over twenty years ago and it seems to be getting worse.  When I first started in retail thirty-five years ago, I was told customer service was the key, and there was plenty of employees to cover all aspects of the business, and we had good benefits and good treatment from the company although low pay, but ten years later, that all died after the old senior management that had been trained by the original owner retired.  Cut, cut, cut, lie, and betray for the quarterly earnings report, forget anything else. Germany\u00b4s largest twins in the electronics market Saturn\/MediaMarkt \u2013 long time rivals until they had to merge \u2013 around 20 years ago already said, we make the money not with the huge TV-sets or PCs but with gadgets and service.  Their more professional counterpart CONRAD Electronic which supplied hobbyists and pros closed all its shops 2022. Since online only. Which nowadays makes it an odyssey to get anything fixed or fix anything yourself. While Saturn\/MediaMarkt was a usual retailer, CONRAD had honor and class. Employees would dwelve into a problem or make detailed suggestions of how to repair yourself.  iFixit is only a shadow of that. I honestly would have huge problems without iFixit. But that too is evidence for some deeper problems. By now if you need any spare part you go online and then via mail. But getting your mail is an issue of its own. Germany has become an insane place. In fact when I want second-hand electronics or kitchenware I turn to Austrian online platforms where private people are selling. With someone from Vienna or from the rural areas there I can be sure they are honest, and the merchandise is in top condition. Living costs are lower there. Quality of everyday life better. So why should people there want to rip you off. The whole thing makes me want to weep.     God help us all.    I hate having old people check me out at the Piggly Wiggly, that clearly MUST work (including an old woman with braces on her wrists-obviously in pain.) People are suffering and it\u2019s going to get worse.     Corporations and billionaires are apex predators and parasites.  These are the people that the democrats and republicans serve (at the state and federal level)    I walked my dog for two hours today.  All I could see was darkness. @IM Doc at 3:36 pm Yikes! That sounds really grim. I haven\u2019t experienced what you did where I live (Ottawa ON, Gatineau QC). I understand some 3rd world-like hiring of poor locals for work day by day does happen in Albany NY some 400km south of us. What city were you in? Keith, the homelessness in Ottawa near the Market (my daughter is living there now) is shocking \u2014 I don\u2019t see how you possibly could have missed it I remember when Panera was bought out by PE and introduced those stupid kiosks. Not long before employee staffing went down. Portions went down. I haven\u2019t been back in a decade really except a few bagels. Those doubled in price. PE enshittification has ruined many a franchise.  I stopped in at a \u201cJersey Mike\u2019s\u201d a year or so ago, and the bread was so small it looked like the bread sticks they give out at Olive Garden. The \u201clarge\u201d sub was more like a 6\u2033.   No sale. I thought the Jersey Mike\u2019s thing just happened recently, around Nov 2024. I did notice this at Jimmy John\u2019s, where the bread last time looked more like a bread stick, which was very out of character for the time I\u2019d bought there before. This back probably back in 2022-23. I haven\u2019t been, my last sortie was Jersey Mike\u2019s somewhere between here and Raleigh. JJ has been majority owned by PE since 2019. I could be confusing the two \u2026 all these sub chains have become the same, probably because they\u2019ve all been bought out by P\/E. Thanks Doc. \u201cAnd it has made me wonder all day if the people who live there are like frogs boiling in hot water.\u201d We are all in that boiling hot water. It\u2019s just that rural areas will have a slower rising of the temperature. >>>It\u2019s just that rural areas will have a slower rising of the temperature. And what happens when the entire pot boils over? We are all entering The Jungle. Or some version thereof. I suppose that life is not completely linear in one direction. Two steps forward, one back. Three forward, two back. I fear we are going to be taking many steps backward before society  as a whole progresses again. Of course if you are in the top tier\u2026. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Jungle You should sit your children down and tell them how cities and how things are done were very much different when you were younger and explain in detail what those differences are. They have no context with what they saw and may think that everything that they took in was \u2018normal\u2019 and just the way things are. On the present trajectory, can you imagine what they city would like like when your kids are your age? They would have to go visit that city in armored cars and wear body armour while hiring the services of a local gang for protection. But most of all with your kids, explain how things got to be the way they are and that is was not some sort of natural evolution but because of choices made \u2013 or not made. Well said. Yes, these were and are choices made, not inevitabilities or laws of nature. I honestly feel sad for kids being born today. Certainly this is not a world I\u2019d want to grow up in. Yeah bro where ya been? I\u2019m 40 and it\u2019s been going downhill for at least a couple decades now as the suburbs sucks up all the rich people. Why don\u2019t you do something about it? Help start a new party. Remember you\u2019re the elder here. In contrast, last Sunday, I was in the American Dream Mall, located in the swamps of New Jersey near NYC, for the first time in my life. Wife wanted to go to the large outdoor Asian food festival, so we did. The indoor water park and indoor theme park were packed with children. Every thing was staffed, stores open (despite the county blue laws), and shelves full.The mall was very crowded. And very diverse. I walked past Orthodox Jewish families with yarmulkes and Muslim families with thawb and burqas.  Felt like I was walking through a crowded consumerism bubble. re: visualizing secret intelligence estimates A paper on the probability words used in intelligence analysis. Each word is meant to relate to a specific probability range. But people interpret these words in  varied ways. \u201cParticipants greatly overestimated the probability for realistic possibility\u201d e.g. \u201c\u201dWe observed that Dutch analysts\u2019 and officer cadets\u2019 estimations of the English-language verbal probability terms were characterized by overestimation at the lowest probability level and underestimation at the highest level\u201d\u201d via: https:\/\/nitter.poast.org\/shashj\/status\/1905558086842019956#m paper\/pdf is here: https:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/epdf\/10.1080\/02684527.2025.2468049?needAccess=true Visualizing versus verbalizing uncertainty in intelligence analysis Mandeep K. Dhami, Jessica K. Witt and Peter De Werd ABSTRACT We compared the probability terms used by Western intelligence organi- zations against two visual encoding channel-based representations of uncertainty (i.e. darkness and thickness). Analysts were more sensitive to the probability being communicated under the word than thickness con- dition but not the darkness condition, with no difference among the visual conditions. However, sensitivity was not perfect. There was no difference in inter-individual variability across all conditions, which was generally poor. Test-retest reliability was greater in the word compared to thickness condition, but not the darkness condition, although, it was imperfect. Finally, analysts did not fully comply with existing uncertainty commu- nication lexicons.\u201d p.s. It appears more like a toolbox for communication for successful careers in the intel community. Rather than warning the superiors of mistakes with honest, relateable analyses. My expectation of the SSA \u201cUpgrade\u201d is that they will \u201cAccidentally crash\u201d the system in a way that will require recipients to reapply in person within a specified period of time or have their benefits cut off. Preferably at a closed office. Simply make an appointment by phone with one of the staff that has been fired to improve efficiency, wait times before having your call cut off seldom exceed 180 minutes. I believe Leland Dudek is the acting director of the SSA, his name will shortly be on the lips of the 71,000,000 Americans who won\u2019t be recieving their Monthly SS $. And almost a third of them own guns. Dude, Dude, Dudek perhaps prudence would be the better course\u2026 What is needed here is some organizing principle that will give those suffering and armed \u2018consumers\u2019 effective targets for their \u201ctender ministrations.\u2019 In short, we need Vanguard Cadres. Mere mobs will not do. Despair not. Stay safe. And the elites were shocked, just shocked when Luigi adjusted the UnitedHealth CEO when almost anyone else regardless of politics or class just purely loathes the American Deathcare industry.   I guess, sorta, that losing my SSDI and Medi-Cal would be soothed by some ancillary justice.  Just being really grim here, I think that some enterprising risk takers would organize a dead pool.  While the NSA and CIA, plus the American military, and all the hired security goons of the oligarchs would be after them, there are probably ways to reduce the risks to anyone running a pool. What a seriously grim, dystopian thought. Now we know what it takes to make Democrats look \u201cgood\u201d. NYT article on the \u201csecret\u201d US involvement in Ukraine war.  No big surprises, but who decided to publish and why now?  US generals want to get their side out first.  Essentially, they could won if they listened to us.  But also how the US got suckered into escalating\u2026they couldn\u2019t help themselves. \u201cNew York Times investigation reveals that America was woven into the war far more intimately and broadly than previously understood. At critical moments, the partnership was the backbone of Ukrainian military operations that, by U.S. counts, have killed or wounded more than 700,000 Russian soldiers. (Ukraine has put its casualty toll at 435,000.) Side by side in Wiesbaden\u2019s mission command center, American and Ukrainian officers planned Kyiv\u2019s counteroffensives. A vast American intelligence-collection effort both guided big-picture battle strategy and funneled precise targeting information down to Ukrainian soldiers in the field.\u201d Very lengthy and detailed. Also very suspect going by those hilariously \u201cmagical thinking\u201d inspired casualty figures. In essence, the NYT is admitting that the US is actively at war with Russia. The intelligence \u201csharing\u201d goes way beyond \u2018business as usual\u2019 military aid. Could this also serve as a \u201cbright shiny object\u201d to distract the PMC class from the upcoming fiasco in the Middle East? \u201cWe lost the Ukraine. So help us that won\u2019t happen in the Eastern Oil Patch. Sign up now and avoid the press gangs.\u201d The NYT is preparing to climb down from its increasingly precarious pro-Zelensky propaganda perch. In a few years, we may even get an Iraq-style apology buried on page 18. The journalistic malfeasance of this once-respectable newspaper is disgusting. Side by side in Wiesbaden\u2019s mission command center, American and Ukrainian officers planned Kyiv\u2019s counteroffensives. And that, sports fans, is what we call \u201can admission against interest.\u201d After examining the witness at trial, the prosecution would turn to the jury and say, \u201cso, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, because the defendant admitted that they were the mastermind of the failed 2023 counteroffensive, you must find them guilty of the worst defeat of an American military operation since Vietnam.\u201d Before the war there was an attempted invasion of the Donbass which ended with the boxing in of the invasion force and which led to Minsk 1. The idea of this invasion force was to run along the southern borders in an attempt to cut those Republic off from Russian support. When I saw this I immediately thought that this was a result of US planning as that would be what a US force would do. But way back then the Ukrainian army was not up to the task and ended up into a cauldron. The battle of Debaltsove, I take it. No, not Debaltsove. I should have clarified that. That one led to Minsk 2. This was an earlier campaign which led to Minsk 1. The militias let the Ukrainians advance so far and then slammed the door behind them leaving them in a cauldron stuck behind enemy lines with no hope of resupply. Forgot to name that battle. It was the Battle of Ilovaisk- https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Battle_of_Ilovaisk It ain\u2019t over until the fiat lady sinks\u2026 2025 Annual Threat Assessment Seems a bit more realistic regarding Ukraine than last years report https:\/\/www.dni.gov\/index.php\/newsroom\/reports-publications\/reports-publications-2025\/4058-2025-annual-threat-assessment \u201cRussia in the past year has seized the upper hand in its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and is on a path to accrue greater leverage to press Kyiv and its Western backers to negotiate an end to the war that grants Moscow concessions it seeks. Continuing the Russia-Ukraine war perpetuates strategic risks to the United States of unintended escalation to large-scale war, the potential use of nuclear weapons, heightened insecurity among NATO Allies, particularly in Central, Eastern, and Northern Europe, and a more emboldened China and North Korea.\u201d Your email address will not be published.

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"ByJason Kirsch, CFP(R)  ByJason Kirsch, CFP(R),  Contributor.  The best stock trading app for beginners in 2025 balances simplicity with educational support, low ... More costs with powerful features and immediate accessibility with long-term growth potential. Entering the world of stock trading can be intimidating for newcomers, but today's mobile apps have made investing more accessible than ever before. In 2025, the landscape of trading platforms has evolved significantly, with user-friendly interfaces and innovative features specifically designed to help beginners confidently navigate the complexities of the market. This article explores the top stock trading apps that cater to novice investors, breaking down their features, pros, cons and why they might be the right choice for those just starting their investment journey. Whether you want to make your first investment with just a few dollars or build a diversified portfolio with educational guidance, I've evaluated the most beginner-friendly trading platforms available this year. We'll examine how these apps balance simplicity with robust functionality, low fees with powerful tools, and automated features with learning resources that empower beginners to become more confident investors. When venturing into stock trading for the first time, the right app can make all the difference between a frustrating experience and an educational journey. Beginners should prioritize platforms with intuitive interfaces that don't overwhelm with complex charts or industry jargon. Look for clean layouts with straightforward navigation that make viewing your portfolio, executing trades, and accessing account information easy. The best apps for newcomers transform complicated financial concepts into digestible, visual information through well-designed dashboards that highlight essential metrics while hiding unnecessary complexity. Low or no commission fees are particularly important for beginners starting with smaller investment amounts. Many modern trading apps have eliminated commission fees on stock trades, but be vigilant about other potential costs like account maintenance fees, inactivity fees or charges for paper statements. Additionally, consider minimum deposit requirements \u2013 several top apps now allow you to begin with as little as $1, removing the traditional barriers to entry that once made stock investment exclusive to those with significant capital. Educational resources are the most valuable feature for novice investors. Prioritize apps that offer in-app tutorials, glossaries of financial terms, investment guides and market news explained in plain language. Some standout platforms even provide interactive lessons, quizzes or simulated trading environments where beginners can practice without risking real money. The most supportive apps contextually integrate these learning tools, offering relevant educational content while making investment decisions, effectively turning each trade into a learning opportunity that builds your investing confidence and knowledge. The stock trading app market has become increasingly competitive, with each platform striving to offer the best combination of accessibility, educational support and valuable features for beginners. This analysis has identified several standout apps that create an optimal environment for novice investors. Each platform brings something unique \u2013 from commission-free trading and fractional shares to automated investing and personalized education. I've evaluated these apps based on their user experience, cost structure, educational offerings and additional features beneficial to those just starting their investment journey. Robinhood continues to dominate the beginner space in 2025 with its minimalist approach to stock trading. The app's sleek, straightforward design eliminates distractions and complexity, allowing new investors to focus on the essentials. Robinhood's commitment to simplicity extends to its account setup process, which takes minutes to complete and requires minimal personal information. The platform has expanded its educational content significantly since its early days, offering comprehensive resources designed specifically for those making their first trades. Robinhood maintains its commission-free trading model for stocks, ETFs and options, making it particularly attractive for beginners with limited capital. Their fractional share feature allows investors to purchase portions of expensive stocks with as little as $1, democratizing access to premium companies like Amazon or Google. The app's \"Learn\" section has been enhanced with interactive modules that adapt to your knowledge level and investing goals. Robinhood's cash management features also let users earn interest on uninvested funds, eliminating the need to transfer money between accounts. Robinhood excels with its intuitive interface, zero-commission trades and fractional share offerings that make investing accessible regardless of budget. The instant deposit feature allows immediate trading with transferred funds while bank processing completes. The app still lacks advanced research tools compared to traditional brokerages, and customer service remains primarily digital with limited phone support. Some critics also note that the streamlined interface, while beginner-friendly, might encourage impulsive trading decisions without adequate consideration of market fundamentals. Robinhood shines as a beginner platform because it removes nearly all friction from the investing process. New investors often hesitate due to complexity, minimum requirements and fees \u2013 Robinhood eliminates these barriers. The platform's gradual introduction of features as users become more experienced creates a natural learning curve. Additionally, the app's transparency around payment for order flow has improved, with more transparent disclosures about how trades are executed. For absolute beginners looking to make their first stock purchase with minimal hassle and maximum guidance, Robinhood remains an excellent entry point into the market. SoFi Invest has evolved into a comprehensive financial ecosystem that benefits beginners seeking an all-in-one solution. The platform integrates investment services with banking, loans and financial planning tools, creating a holistic approach to money management. This integration allows new investors to see how their stock investments fit into their broader financial picture. SoFi's community aspects distinguish it from competitors, featuring forums where beginners can connect with more experienced investors and participate in virtual investment clubs. SoFi's automated investing option stands out for beginners who prefer a hands-off approach, offering pre-built portfolios based on risk tolerance with no management fees. For those wanting more control, their active investing platform provides commission-free trading with fractional shares starting at $5. The platform's educational resources include personalized recommendations based on your financial situation and goals, webinars hosted by certified financial planners, and a unique \"Money Milestones\" feature that guides users through key financial decisions beyond investing, creating a more comprehensive financial education. SoFi's greatest strength lies in integrating multiple financial services, allowing beginners to manage investments alongside student loan refinancing, banking and credit monitoring. Their member benefits include free access to financial advisors \u2013 a rare perk for a commission-free platform. SoFi's investment selection is somewhat limited compared to dedicated trading platforms, with fewer options for bonds and no direct access to mutual funds. Some users also report that the mobile app can occasionally feel cluttered due to the breadth of services offered under one interface. SoFi creates an ideal environment for beginners by recognizing that new investors rarely consider their stock portfolio in isolation from their overall financial health. The platform's focus on financial education extends beyond trading strategies to include fundamentals like budgeting and debt management \u2013 essential knowledge for sustainable investing. SoFi's community features also address the psychological aspects of investing, connecting beginners with peers facing similar challenges and providing social reinforcement for good financial habits. For newcomers looking to build a solid financial foundation alongside their investment portfolio, SoFi offers the most comprehensive ecosystem. Fidelity has successfully transformed its reputation as a traditional brokerage by developing one of the most beginner-friendly mobile experiences in the industry. Their app combines an established financial giant's institutional knowledge and security with modern features designed specifically for novice investors. Fidelity's approach focuses on sustainable investing education rather than gamification, with an interface that encourages thoughtful decision-making through simplified research tools and jargon-free explanations of investment options. Fidelity offers zero-commission stock trading alongside fractional shares through their \"Stocks by the Slice\" program, allowing purchases of popular stocks with as little as $1. Their standout feature for beginners is the personalized learning path that adapts based on your knowledge level and investment goals. The app's research center provides simplified versions of professional-grade analysis tools, clearly explaining key metrics and what they mean for potential investments. Fidelity's Youth Account program is particularly noteworthy for parents looking to teach teens about investing with supervised accounts that include built-in educational resources. Fidelity excels in providing institutional-quality research in accessible formats, giving beginners insights typically available only to experienced investors. Their cash management features are among the best in the industry, with higher-than-average interest rates on uninvested cash and free ATM access worldwide. Their comprehensive customer service options include 24\/7 phone support, live chat and physical branch locations. On the downside, Fidelity's app contains so many features that the learning curve can be slightly steeper than ultra-simplified alternatives. While excellent, their educational content tends to be more text-heavy than interactive. Fidelity provides an ideal growth path for beginners who want an app they won't outgrow as their investing sophistication increases. Unlike platforms that may require transitioning to more advanced services as your needs evolve, Fidelity offers everything from basic stock trades to retirement planning under one account. Their focus on fiduciary responsibility and transparent fee structures creates trust, a crucial factor for newcomers wary of the financial industry. For beginners who value comprehensive services, educational depth and the security of an established institution, Fidelity offers the most sustainable long-term platform. Betterment has become the premier robo-advisor for beginners seeking a hands-off investment experience. Unlike traditional trading platforms, Betterment focuses on automated portfolio management based on proven financial principles and modern portfolio theory. The app's clean, goal-centric interface helps newcomers focus on the \"why\" of investing rather than the \"what,\" organizing investments around specific life goals like retirement, significant purchases, or building wealth. This approach helps beginners avoid the common pitfall of random stock picking and instead builds proper diversification from day one. Betterment's core feature is its automated portfolio construction and management, which creates diversified ETF portfolios tailored to your risk tolerance and time horizon with no minimum investment requirement. Their goal-based approach allows users to create portfolios for different objectives, each with appropriate risk levels and investment strategies. The platform's automatic rebalancing, tax-loss harvesting and dividend reinvestment work continuously in the background, optimizing your investments without requiring active management. Betterment's newest feature, \"Financial Health Score,\" provides personalized guidance beyond investments, analyzing your financial picture and suggesting improvements. Betterment removes the complexity of investment selection, offering perfectly diversified portfolios with zero effort required from the user. Their transparent fee structure (0.25% for the standard plan) is easily understood without hidden costs. The platform's automatic tax optimization features can significantly improve returns, especially in taxable accounts. On the downside, active traders will find Betterment limiting, as you cannot select individual stocks or make trades based on market timing. Some users also note that the advisory fee, while reasonable, does add up over time compared to self-directed platforms with one-time commission fees. Betterment is perfect for beginners who lack the knowledge, time or emotional discipline for successful self-directed investing. The platform provides a professional financial advisor in app form, implementing strategies that require significant investment knowledge. Their behavioral finance features, such as automated deposits and limited portfolio viewing options during market volatility, help prevent the emotional mistakes that plague many new investors. For beginners who want to invest correctly from day one without the learning curve of traditional trading, Betterment offers the most scientifically sound approach with the least effort required. Selecting the perfect stock trading app requires honest self-assessment about your financial goals, knowledge level and investing style. Begin by clarifying your investment objectives \u2013 are you saving for retirement, building wealth over time or exploring trading as a potential source of income? Each goal suggests different features: long-term investors might prioritize retirement account options and automated investing, while those interested in active trading need robust research tools and competitive execution speeds. Consider your learning style as well \u2013 visual learners might prefer platforms with interactive charts and video tutorials, while readers might value comprehensive written guides. Don't underestimate the importance of user experience \u2013 even the most feature-rich app will be useless if you find it confusing or frustrating to navigate. Most platforms offer free trials or demo accounts that allow you to explore the interface before committing any money. Pay attention to how intuitive the essential functions feel and whether the educational content resonates with your learning style. Finally, consider the app's growth potential \u2013 while simplicity is valuable for beginners, the ideal platform should offer increasingly sophisticated tools and options as your knowledge and confidence grow, preventing the need to transfer your portfolio to a new platform later in your investing journey. Bottom Line The best stock trading app for beginners in 2025 balances simplicity with educational support, low costs with powerful features and immediate accessibility with long-term growth potential. Robinhood continues to excel for absolute beginners seeking the most straightforward entry point. SoFi offers the most comprehensive financial ecosystem for holistic money management, and Fidelity provides the strongest foundation for serious long-term investors. Regardless of your chosen platform, the key to successful investing lies in the app and your commitment to ongoing financial education and disciplined strategy. The democratization of investing through these accessible platforms means there's never been a better time to begin your investment journey. Robinhood offers the most straightforward entry point for absolute beginners, SoFi provides the best all-in-one financial management platform, and Fidelity delivers the most comprehensive long-term solution with superior educational resources. Betterment is minimal and bare bones, but it does the trick if you want to invest in ETFs. No, most modern stock trading apps allow you to start investing with as little as $1 through fractional shares, eliminating the traditional high barriers to entry for stock market participation. Choose apps offering commission-free trading, avoid platforms with account maintenance fees, utilize fractional shares to invest efficiently with small amounts and be aware of potential hidden costs like currency conversion fees for international stocks. Many stock trading apps now offer retirement account options, automated investing features, dividend reinvestment programs and educational resources specifically designed to support long-term investment strategies rather than just active trading.

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"Markets     Hot Stocks     Fear & Greed Index                  Latest Market News                  Hot Stocks     Follow:              In the world of electric vehicles, there\u2019s a Chinese company outdoing Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla. And it\u2019s just getting started.                   BYD, the Shenzhen-based Chinese EV champion, eclipsed Tesla in annual sales last year. Last week, it unveiled a revolutionary battery charging technology that it says adds 250 miles of range in five minutes, outpacing Tesla\u2019s Superchargers, which take 15 minutes to add 200 miles. And last month, BYD launched \u201cGod\u2019s Eye,\u201d an advanced driver-assistance system rivaling Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving feature, at no extra cost for most of its cars.                   They\u2019re just three examples of how BYD has been pulling ahead of Tesla. The company once laughed off by Musk is now effectively outperforming Tesla in sales, innovation and price competitiveness.                   \u201cThey\u2019re not resting on their laurels, as you can see from the God\u2019s Eye announcement and from the fast-charging announcement,\u201d Tu Le, founder and managing director of the consultancy firm Sino Auto Insights, told CNN. \u201cThey\u2019re content to push the envelope and set the pace for the whole world.\u201d                   Having dominated its home market of China, the world\u2019s largest auto market, BYD is starting to expand globally, with notable exceptions like the United States, a country it is effectively barred from due to 100% tariffs on its passenger cars.                   Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the rise of the Chinese EV maker, and how it is upending the global market for clean-energy cars.                   Founded in 1995 by Wang Chuanfu in China\u2019s megacity of Shenzhen, BYD is the country\u2019s No 1 automaker. It exports its electric taxis, buses and other vehicles to markets across Europe, South America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East.                   In China, BYD accounted for 32% of last year\u2019s total sales of new energy vehicles, which include hybrids, far outpacing Tesla\u2019s 6.1% market share, according to the China Passenger Car Association. (BYD makes both battery-powered cars as well as hybrids, while Tesla makes only fully electric vehicles powered by batteries.)                   BYD reported $107 billion in sales for 2024, a 29% jump from the previous year, on deliveries of 4.27 million cars, including hybrids. By comparison, Tesla\u2019s 2024 revenue was $97.7 billion, and it delivered 1.79 million battery-powered vehicles. Its annual deliveries declined for the first time last year by 1.1%.                   While BYD\u2019s battery-powered EV shipments of 1.76 million vehicles were marginally short of Tesla\u2019s, investors and analysts are bullish on BYD\u2019s potential as it expands overseas. Most of BYD\u2019s shipments were delivered to domestic customers with just 10% exported to overseas markets.                   \u201cWe believe sales momentum will remain robust for 2025, and BYD will be able to retain its leadership with the rollouts of new-generation models equipped with the advanced driver-assistance system,\u201d Vincent Sun, Morningstar\u2019s senior equity analyst, wrote in a Monday research note.                   While many believe BYD stands for \u201cBuild Your Dreams,\u201d Wang said in an interview for Tencent that it originally had no such meaning. It was simply an \u201codd\u201d combination of three Chinese characters \u201cbi ya di,\u201d he told the online interview program. The slogan \u201cBuild Your Dream\u201d was conceived later for marketing purposes.                   BYD\u2019s top-selling passenger vehicles are the Qin and Song models, which cater to a broad swath of consumers drawn to the company\u2019s reputation for affordability. The Qin, a compact sedan, is available as both a plug-in hybrid and a fully electric model, while the Song comprises a lineup of compact crossover SUVs.                   Unlike Tesla, which has positioned itself as a premium brand, BYD has built its success on price accessibility. Its entry-level model starts at just over $10,000 in China, a fraction of the cost of Tesla\u2019s least expensive Model 3, which sells for more than $32,000.                   Though BYD\u2019s passenger cars have yet to enter the US market due to high tariffs, its electric buses are already in service in California.                   Wang was born in 1966 to a simple rural family in Anhui province in eastern China. But disaster struck when both of his parents died young, leaving him orphaned when he was in middle school, according to The Paper, a Chinese state-owned publication. Wang relied on his older brother to provide for him and his education.                   Wang spent several years at the state-owned Beijing Nonferrous Metals Research Institute, where he got his master\u2019s degree. The institute later established a battery company in Shenzhen and dispatched him there.                   Wang soon sensed an opportunity. He started BYD with a team of around 20 people and 2.5 million yuan ($351,994) that Wang borrowed from his cousin, according to The Paper.                   He quickly achieved initial success by leveraging China\u2019s cheap labor force, upending an industry once monopolized by Japanese companies.                   In 2003, Wang followed his instincts, venturing into the car industry by acquiring a struggling state-owned automaker for 269 million yuan ($38 million). Its investors were worried, sending the company\u2019s shares plunging by more than 30%. But Wang was unrepentant.                   The automaker he acquired had little to offer technologically speaking, Wang recalled in the interview, so he bought many second-hand cars from around the world and took them apart to study.                   \u201cToyota, being the world\u2019s number one automaker, its craftsmanship, design, and products are worth learning from \u2014 only by standing on its shoulders can we reach new heights,\u201d he said in the Tencent interview.                   He was eventually vindicated, receiving a $230 million investment in 2008 from Warren Buffet, whose endorsement garnered him worldwide attention.                   BYD didn\u2019t start off making cars. It was a battery maker first, which Wang said cemented the firm\u2019s foundation and set it up for success.                   \u201cThe bottleneck for electric vehicles is the battery,\u201d he said in the Tencent interview. \u201cIf you master battery technology or accurately predict its future direction, you are essentially setting the strategic course for the entire EV industry.\u201d                   Like Apple founder Steve Jobs and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Wang, who had studied metallurgical chemistry, was obsessed with engineering details and remains so today. He said in the Tencent interview that he spends around 60% to 70% of his time on technology and only the rest on management.                   One of the innovations born out of BYD\u2019s focus on technology is its blade battery, a lithium iron phosphate battery that it pioneered in 2020. The company said the unique shape allows it to maximize the use of available space in the battery pack while reducing the chances of catching fire when damaged.                   Beyond batteries, BYD also makes a high percentage of its components in-house, relying less on external suppliers in comparison with other carmakers. This vertical integration allows it to scale up its production more easily and drive down cost significantly, according to Le.                   BYD has also been known for its aggressive pricing strategy amid an ongoing price war in China and isn\u2019t shy about asking its suppliers for discounts.                   For now, BYD and other Chinese EVs are virtually locked out of the US market due to tariffs. But as BYD evolves, Le said, trade barriers might give certain companies a \u201cfalse sense of security.\u201d                   \u201cThey\u2019re not planning to take their foot off the gas on research and development spend this year, so it\u2019s going to be a consistent onslaught probably through the end of this decade,\u201d he said.                   Despite its lack of US presence, BYD is making inroads elsewhere.                   Wang has pledged to increase its total shipments by nearly 30% this year and nearly double its overseas deliveries to more than 800,000 vehicles, according to state media.                   But some challenges have emerged.                   \u201cAside from the geopolitics, I think there are more challenges in how they operate in different countries,\u201d said Lei Xing, an independent analyst focusing on China\u2019s auto industry.                   In Brazil, authorities said in December they had found workers working in \u201cslavery-like conditions\u201d at a BYD construction site. The company later denied those accusations.                   In Mexico, Beijing is reportedly delaying approval for a local plant because of concerns that BYD\u2019s smart car technology could potentially be transferred to the US, according to the Financial Times.                   Still, some analysts believe BYD has become an unstoppable force. With an intense focus on technology, Xing said BYD is poised to deliver new advancements, whether in price or innovation.                   \u201cThey\u2019re just starting,\u201d he said.

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"Business Insider Edition  Three years ago, my family moved from Melbourne to Bright, Australia. We'd lived in Melbourne for eight years and were ready for a change.          One night in October 2021, my husband put an idea on the table. He asked if I wanted to turn over a new leaf and move to Bright, where his family was based. We'd already vacationed there plenty of times, and I'd enjoyed it, so I said, \"Sure, let's do it.\" Soon, we were planning our escape from Melbourne.               We'd been living in the home we'd bought together for four years, and though we were ready to leave Melbourne, I had reservations about selling. We also didn't want to buy in Bright because I didn't know whether I'd enjoy living in such a small town. I suggested we spend a year there and then reassess after that.               The first major hurdle we faced was finding a place to live. Though small, Bright is a popular tourist destination known for its wineries, hiking, and gold rush history. It's surrounded by beautiful mountains and is a short drive from Mount Hotham, a popular ski resort. Rental properties in the area are in short supply, but we were lucky enough to find accommodation at a friend's place while they were overseas for the year. We relocated at the end of January 2022 and rented out our home in Melbourne to tenants.               Our family quickly fell in love with the slower pace of country life. Later that year, in August, we welcomed our third child to the family.               As a growing family, we needed our own space, so in January 2023, we moved into a simple three-bedroom house conveniently close to town. Then, last October, we found our current rental home \u2014 a beautiful three-bedroom, two-bath property in a green, family-friendly part of Bright.               My favorite thing about the property is the big back garden. Birds love it, too, and pink galahs and crimson rosellas visit every day. There are three small vegetable plots where we grow tomatoes and strawberries, and my children spend hours outdoors in nature.               Financially, renting where we want to live and owning a property elsewhere has been a good decision. Our rent each week is less than our weekly mortgage repayment (which is pretty much covered by the tenants), so we are essentially saving money.               Renting also means we can move freely and live where we can't afford to buy. Bright is much more expensive than Melbourne, and the median house price is over $1 million. We get to live here while paying off our mortgage in Melbourne, and that's a big drawcard.               Sometimes, my husband feels guilty about the kids not having a \"proper\" family home. They've never owned a pet because it's easier to get a rental property without one, and that makes me sad. Our son is 9 years old, and he's lived in six different houses, which is not ideal. But I try to think of it as a positive \u2014 it certainly keeps life interesting!               While my husband and I don't want to rent forever, for the time being, it's working well for us. When the market in Melbourne picks up, we may decide to sell our property there and buy one in Bright. But renting has definitely given us options.

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"ByJason Kirsch, CFP(R)  ByJason Kirsch, CFP(R),  Contributor.  Dub represents a novel approach to investment strategy by democratizing access to the trading ... More activities of politicians and other influential market participants. Technological innovation continues to democratize access to financial markets in the evolving landscape of retail investing. Among these innovations, Dub has emerged as a distinctive platform that allows everyday investors to track and potentially mirror the investment activities of politicians, corporate insiders and other influential market participants. This specialized trading app has captured attention for its unique approach to investment strategy, leveraging publicly available financial disclosures to provide previously complex insights for average investors to access and analyze. This article explores what Dub is, how it functions, the appeal of tracking politicians' portfolios and its key features. We'll also examine who might benefit most from this platform, weigh its advantages and disadvantages and answer common questions about this increasingly popular trading tool. Dub is a specialized trading application that launched in early 2023, designed to provide retail investors with transparent access to the trading activities of U.S. politicians, corporate executives and other influential market participants. The platform's core mission centers on demystifying the often opaque world of political trading by aggregating, analyzing and presenting publicly disclosed financial information in an accessible format. Targeting novice and experienced investors, Dub positions itself at the intersection of civic transparency and investment strategy. The app synthesizes data from official government filings and corporate disclosures, transforming complex regulatory documents into actionable trading insights. At its core, Dub aims to level the playing field between everyday investors and those with potential information advantages, offering users the ability to make more informed investment decisions based on the activities of influential market participants. Dub systematically tracks and analyzes public financial disclosures required by law, particularly those mandated by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012. This legislation requires members of Congress, their staff, and certain executive branch employees to report their financial transactions within 30-45 days of execution. Dub's technology continuously monitors these filings, primarily from the Senate Office of Public Records and the House Office of the Clerk, processing the data as soon as it becomes available. When a politician or tracked insider executes a trade, Dub's system identifies the disclosure, processes the information and pushes notifications to interested users. The platform translates often-complex government filings into user-friendly alerts detailing the stock traded, transaction type (purchase or sale), approximate value range and when the transaction occurred. This near real-time monitoring enables users to react to these disclosures promptly, a significant advantage considering the typical lag between a politician's trade and its public disclosure. Beyond merely presenting the data, Dub incorporates analytical tools that help users identify patterns and trends in trading behavior. The platform categorizes transactions by industry, size, and timing relative to market events or legislative activities. This contextualization helps users understand what trades were made and potentially why they were made. It offers insights that might inform their investment decisions or satisfy their curiosity about how elected officials manage their finances. The appeal of monitoring politicians' trading activities stems from several factors, including the potential information advantage elected officials may possess. Members of Congress frequently receive briefings on national security, economic matters and pending legislation that could impact specific industries or companies. While trading based on material nonpublic information is illegal, the line between general knowledge gained through congressional work and specific inside information can sometimes appear blurry to the public. Historical analysis suggests that some politicians have demonstrated remarkable market timing. Various academic studies, including research from the Journal of Financial Economics, have indicated that certain members of Congress have achieved returns that consistently outperform market averages. For instance, a widely cited 2004 study found that Senators' stock purchases outperformed the market by approximately 12% annually. While more recent research has shown mixed results, especially after the STOCK Act's implementation, public perception of politicians' potential trading advantages persists, driving interest in platforms like Dub. The transparency that comes with tracking politicians' portfolios also serves a civic purpose. By making these financial activities more visible and digestible, platforms like Dub contribute to public oversight of elected officials. For many users, the motivation isn't purely financial\u2014it's about understanding how those in positions of power manage their investments, especially when their legislative decisions could potentially impact those same investments. This transparency helps citizens evaluate potential conflicts of interest and holds politicians accountable for their financial activities while in public service. Dub distinguishes itself through a comprehensive suite of features designed to provide users with actionable insights based on the financial activities of politicians, corporate insiders and other influential market participants. The cornerstone of Dub's platform is its comprehensive politician portfolio tracking capability. Users gain visibility into the trading activities of hundreds of members of Congress across both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The platform reports individual transactions and aggregates data to reveal broader patterns in political trading behavior. Users can filter and sort by politician, political party, committee membership and transaction size to identify trends that align with their investment interests. The platform's politician tracking goes beyond basic disclosure reporting by providing contextual information about each legislator's committee assignments and voting record. This additional context helps users evaluate whether politicians' trades correlate with their legislative activities or specialized knowledge. For example, a user might find it particularly interesting when a member of the Senate Banking Committee makes significant trades in financial sector stocks, or when a member of the Armed Services Committee invests in defense contractors. Cross-referencing financial and legislative activity represents one of Dub's most valuable analytical features. Dub's copy trading feature transforms passive tracking into an active investment strategy. The platform allows users to automatically mirror the trades of selected politicians, corporate insiders, or other users with a demonstrated track record of success. When enabled, this feature executes proportional trades in a user's connected brokerage account when their chosen figures make transactions, allowing investors to delegate their trading decisions to the investment behavior of those they perceive as having market insight. The implementation incorporates customizable parameters that give users control over their copy trading experience. Users can set maximum allocation percentages, specify which securities to include or exclude and establish value thresholds to prevent unwanted small or excessively large positions. This automation removes emotional decision-making from the equation while allowing personalization based on individual risk tolerance and investment goals. For investors who believe in the information advantage or market acumen of specific politicians or insiders, this feature provides a turnkey solution to leverage that perceived edge. Beyond political trading, Dub provides comprehensive tracking of corporate insider transactions. The platform monitors Form 4 filings submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which disclose when corporate directors, officers and significant shareholders buy or sell company stock. These transactions often signal insider confidence or concern about a company's prospects, making them valuable indicators for external investors to gauge internal sentiment about a corporation's future. Dub enhances raw insider trading data with analytical context, including historical patterns of insider behavior, correlation with company announcements or earnings reports and performance metrics of previous insider transactions. The platform distinguishes between routine transactions (like scheduled sales under 10b5-1 plans) and discretionary trades that might carry more substantial signaling value. Users can focus on specific types of insiders, such as C-suite executives whose decisions may reflect more profound company knowledge, or independent directors whose purchases might indicate confidence without the potential conflicts of interest that executive compensation packages can create. Dub's alert system enables users to receive timely notifications based on their specific interests and investment criteria. Rather than being overwhelmed with all transaction data, users can filter alerts by politician, insider, company, industry sector, transaction size or transaction type. These customizable parameters ensure users receive only the most relevant information that aligns with their investment strategy or areas of interest. The platform offers multiple notification channels, including push notifications, email alerts and SMS messages, allowing users to select their preferred communication method based on urgency and importance. Alert timing options range from immediate notifications for high-priority transactions to daily or weekly digests for less time-sensitive information. This flexibility helps users balance the need for timely information with the risk of notification fatigue. For serious investors, these custom alerts can provide a crucial time advantage in reacting to significant trades, especially given the reporting delays already built into the disclosure system. Dub fosters a collaborative investment community through its integrated discussion forums and social features. Each tracked portfolio, politician and security has a dedicated discussion space where users can share insights, ask questions and debate the significance of recent transactions. These community-driven conversations often surface valuable perspectives that might not be immediately apparent from the raw trading data alone. The platform incorporates reputation systems and verification mechanisms to help users identify credible community members with demonstrated expertise or track records. Discussion threads are organized by topic and recency, making conversations about specific trades or broader investment themes easy to follow. For many users, this social dimension transforms Dub from a mere data provider into an interactive learning environment where they can develop their investment knowledge through peer discussion. The community aspect also serves as a real-time filter that helps highlight particularly significant transactions that might otherwise get lost in the volume of disclosure data. While politician portfolio tracking remains Dub's signature feature, the platform has expanded to monitor various influential market participants. Corporate executives, institutional fund managers and high-profile individual investors with strong track records are all included in Dub's tracking ecosystem. This broader coverage acknowledges that valuable trading insights can come from many sources beyond Washington, D.C. The platform also incorporates thematic portfolio tracking, allowing users to follow investment activities focused on specific sectors, emerging technologies or macroeconomic trends. These portfolios aggregate transactions from tracked individuals demonstrating particular interest or expertise in a given area. For instance, users can precisely follow the collective trading activity of politicians who sit on technology oversight committees or corporate insiders within the renewable energy sector. This multidimensional approach to portfolio tracking provides users with a more comprehensive view of market activity among informed participants. Dub appeals primarily to information-oriented investors who believe that understanding the behavior of well-connected market participants provides valuable trading insights. These investors typically take a more active approach to portfolio management and are willing to adjust positions based on signals from tracked individuals. The platform particularly suits those skeptical about market efficiency and believe that certain participants may possess information advantages that aren't fully reflected in market prices. Mid-to-long-term investors, rather than day traders, tend to derive the most benefit from Dub's features. Given the inherent reporting delays in the disclosure system, the platform isn't optimized for high-frequency trading strategies that require immediate execution. Instead, it better serves investors looking for intermediate-term positioning based on the activities of those potentially privy to market-moving information or industry developments. Those interested in the intersection of politics, business and investing will find additional value in the platform beyond pure financial returns, as it provides a unique window into how power and capital interact in American political and economic systems. Bottom Line Dub represents a novel approach to investment strategy by democratizing access to the trading activities of politicians and other influential market participants. While not a guaranteed path to outperformance, the platform provides unique insights that can complement traditional investment research. Its value proposition extends beyond potential returns to increased transparency in public officials\u2019 financial activities. For investors willing to look beyond conventional wisdom and incorporate alternative data into their decision-making process, Dub offers a distinctive tool that blends financial strategy with civic awareness. Dub operates on a freemium model, offering basic tracking features at no cost while reserving premium features like advanced filters, real-time alerts, and copy trading functionality for paid subscription tiers that typically range from $15-50 monthly, depending on the plan selected. Research shows mixed results, with some studies indicating outperformance by certain politicians while others suggest more average returns after accounting for risk factors. Success likely depends on which specific politicians you track, timing considerations given disclosure delays and how their trades are incorporated into a broader investment strategy. The Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act of 2012 requires members of Congress, their staff, and certain executive branch employees to publicly disclose financial transactions exceeding $1,000 within 30-45 days, with these reports filed to the Senate Office of Public Records or House Office of the Clerk. Yes, Dub comprehensively tracks corporate insider transactions through SEC Form 4 filings, monitoring trading activity by company executives, board members and major shareholders while providing analytical context to help users distinguish between routine transactions and potentially significant discretionary trades.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"Head to the grocery store in the US and the shelves are stocked with jars of St Dalfour strawberry spread and Bonne Maman raspberry preserves - some of the more than $200 million (\u00a3154m) in jams that Europe sends to the US each year. But try looking for American-made jelly in Europe, and you're likely to come up short.  The US exports less than $300,000 (\u00a3231,000) in jam each year to the bloc.  It's an imbalance that US company JM Smucker, one of the biggest sellers of such products in the US, blames on a 24%-plus import tax its fruit spreads face in the EU. \"The miniscule value of US exports to the European Union is entirely attributable to the high EU tariff,\" the company wrote in a letter to the White House this month, asking the Trump administration to address the issue as it prepares to levy \"reciprocal\" tariffs on America's biggest trading partners.  \"Reciprocal US tariffs on EU jams and jellies would serve to level the playing field,\" the company said, noting that the highest US jam tariff is currently just 4.5%. Globally, Trump's push to deploy tariffs against close trading partners - many of which have average tariff levels similar to America's - has generated anger and bafflement, while drawing warnings from economists about higher prices and other potential economic pain. Some businesses in the US have echoed those concerns, but Trump's calls for tariffs are also channelling longstanding frustrations many firms have about foreign competition and policies they face abroad.  Smucker's letter was one of hundreds submitted to the White House, seeking to influence the next set of tariffs, expected to be unveiled on 2 April.  Apple farmers raised the big disparity in import duties their fruit faces in countries such as India (50%), Thailand (40%) and Brazil (10%), as well as sanitary rules in countries such as Australia they said unfairly block their exports. Streaming businesses flagged digital taxes in Canada and Turkey that they said \"unfairly target and discriminate\" against US companies. The oil and natural gas lobby criticised regulations in Mexico that require partnership with the state-owned oil company and other policies.  The White House itself spotlighted uneven ethanol tariffs in Brazil (18%, compared with 2.5% in the US), car tariffs in Europe (10%, compared with 2.5% in the US) and motorcycles in India (until a few years ago, 100% vs 2.4% in the US). Trump has suggested that his plan for reciprocal tariffs will help remedy such grievances, pumping up his announcement as \"Liberation Day\". But even the businesses seeking action on their own issues have expressed hesitation about the president's tariff-first, ask-questions-later strategy, which risks retaliation and a wider trade war.  With 2 April looming, there remains widespread uncertainty about the goals and scope of White House plans, especially as Trump launches more duties. \"We're going to be nice,\" he said this week, at the same time as he announced potentially devastating tariffs on foreign cars and car parts. \"I think people will be pleasantly surprised.\" India has already said it would lower its tariffs on motorcycles - an apparent bet that Trump's tariffs are a strategy designed to gain leverage for trade talks. But analysts warned that those hoping that Trump plans to use his reciprocal tariffs to negotiate changes elsewhere may be disappointed, as the president has also indicated he could be satisfied by simply hitting back.  \"Some days it's about revenge and just equalising things, and other days it's about lowering tariffs and then other days, third days, it's about bringing manufacturing to the United States,\" said William Reinsch, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. \"He's used them all at different times - there's not a single thread here that you can rely on.\" The mismatch between the blunt tool of tariffs and the more niche issues firms want the White House to champion has led to a delicate dance, as businesses suggest tariffs in their own interest, while also hoping to avoid the repercussions of the kind of sweeping duties that Trump has suggested might be on the table. For example, steel manufacturer NorthStar BlueScope Steel, which employs 700 people in the US melting steel from recycled metal, urged Trump to expand tariffs on steel and aluminium to parts.  At the same time, however, it asked for an exemption for the raw materials it needs, such as scrap metal.  Likewise, the lobby group for JM Smucker and other big food manufacturers, the Consumer Brands Association, warned against \"overly broad and sweeping tariffs\" that might end up making it more expensive for its members to import ingredients like cocoa, which are not made in the US.  \"I don't necessarily want the current administration to say, well, we'll impose a tariff,\" Tom Madrecki, the group's vice president of supply chain resiliency, said at a recent forum about tariffs, hosted by Farmers for Free Trade. \"It's this careful balance between yes, I want you to take an America First trade policy and action to counter unfair trade policies abroad... but maybe not quite in that way.\" Wilbur Ross, who served as Trump's commerce secretary in his first term, said he thought business worries would dissipate as Trump's plans become clear, calling 2 April a \"big step\". But he noted that the president saw little downside to using tariffs, viewing them as either a source of new revenue, or a way to reduce imports and encourage more manufacturing.  \"He's very committed,\" Ross said. \"People should have known that something like this was coming because he's been talking about it for many, many years.\" Republicans, traditionally the pro-trade party, have stayed supportive of Trump's strategy, even as tariff announcements have been blamed for the recent stock market sell-off and weakness in recent surveys of business and consumer confidence. At a recent hearing on trade, Representative Jodey Arrington, a Republican who represents Texas, acknowledged that there might be \"some pain associated on the front end\", but maintained Trump's focus on the issue would create opportunities for his constituents in the end.  \"It just seems to me that it's un-American to not fight for our American manufacturers, producers and workers to simply have an even playing field,\" he said. \"We're simply attempting... to reset those relationships such that we're playing by the same set of rules,\" he added. \"Then everyone wins.\"  Critically endangered Galapagos tortoises Abrazzo and Mommy are parents of four hatchlings at Philadelphia Zoo High winds and heavy rain were expected to continue into Sunday, delaying clean-up efforts.

More reflects concerns for a possible all-out oil price war and economic slowdown. (Photo by Michael Nagle\/Xinhua via Getty Images) It was another rough week for the stock market as the higher-than-expected PCE and the sharp decline in Consumer Sentiment helped increase the already high bearish sentiment. The heavy selling at the March 13 lows and the multiple declines below the weekly starc- bands favored an oversold rally to reduce very high bearish sentiment. Looking at past market trading I was looking for either a strong two-week rally that might set the stage for a retest of the lows like in February 2016. The other scenario I discussed just after the lows was for a V-shaped rally, like early 2019, driven by short covering. In either case, I was looking for a strong weekly close soon after the lows to support either potential path for the stock market. The Spyder Trust (SPY) was up only 0.5% for the week ending March 21 as it closed at $563.96 well below the week\u2019s high at $570.95. The weekly close in the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) below its yearly pivot at $481.91 was also a sign of weakness and put additional focus on last week\u2019s close. Stocks gapped higher on Monday and while the averages held their gains into the close on Monday there was not much buying on Tuesday as the S&P 500 and SPY formed Dojis. The sharply lower closes on Wednesday triggered a Doji sell signal in the S&P 500 and the A\/D numbers were negative. S&P Stock Index Futures The release of the PCE report on Friday dropped the S&P futures another 50 points as they ended up losing 136 points for the day. The completion of the daily flag formation (lines a and b) was confirmed by a negative daily signal (see arrow). The formation projects a decline to the 5,500 area. The decline below the starc- bands on March 10 and 11 as well as trading below the weekly starc- bands did indicate a high risk on the short side. This week's action was a clear indication that my mid-March stock market scenarios were wrong. Markets Last week\u2019s selling did cause further technical damages as the NDX 100 dropped 2.4% for the week followed by a decline of 1.6% in the iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) which is now down 9.1% year-to-date. NDX is not far behind as it is down 8.2% YTD. For the week the S&P 500 was down 1.5% as it was weaker than the NYSE Composite and the Dow Jones Industrial Average which were down 1%. On a YTD basis, the Dow is holding up quite a bit better down 2.3% versus the 5.1% decline in the S&P 500. The more defensive Dow Jones Utility Average was up 0.2% last week and is still higher YTD up 2.9% which is well behind the YTD gain of 17.3% for the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). SPY Weekly A\/D Lines The completion of the flag formation typically signals another few weeks on the downside but a look at the weekly and monthly charts does not indicate the start of a new bear market. I would expect the S&P 500 to close higher in the 2nd quarter. Last week\u2019s reversal for the Spyder Trust (SPY) reveals that last week\u2019s high at $576.41 fell short of the 20-week EMA at $580.23. The uptrend from the 2024 lows, line b, is just below $550.00 with the weekly starc- band at $537.15. The weekly S&P 500 A\/D line is barely above its flat EMA after forming a negative divergence, line c, at the early 2025 highs (line a). A drop in the A\/D line below this year's low and the support at line d, would warn of a deeper decline. The weekly NYSE All A\/D line is below its EMA and has key support to watch at point e. The NYSE Stocks Only A\/D line (not shown) is also slightly below its EMA but is also above the recent lows. Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) was down 2.3% last week and with one day left in the month is down 7.6%. That may be a shock to some but the worst year since 2000 was February 2001 when it was down 26.5%. The QQQ close at $468.94 was below the yearly pivot at $481.91 for the second week in a row. The March 14 low was $466.43. The weekly starc- band is at $449.01. There is strong chart support at $448.20 which corresponds to the September 2024 low and the March 2024 high, line. This is 4.3% below Friday\u2019s close. The Nasdaq 100 A\/D line closed below its WMA for the third week in a row. The A\/D line did confirm the early 2025 highs before it started to decline. The trend in the weekly A\/D is still positive and it would take a decline below the support at line b for it to start a new negative downtrend. Last week\u2019s negative turn in the weekly and daily momentum puts the focus on the March lows for the major averages and market-tracking ETFS. Any V-shaped rally will now need to come from lower levels. There is the possibility for a bottom to be formed on a retest of the lows or even on new lows. The market is focused on the current April 2nd deadline for new tariffs though the date as well as the tariffs could always be changed again. A major upside market reversal would likely require a major policy shift that does not look likely right now. To signal a resumption of the positive intermediate market trend I would need to see the weekly A\/D lines breakout to new all-time highs. If instead, the A\/D lines break their more important support levels then further downside targets will need to be considered. The current outlook does not warrant any changes right now to my long-term portfolio as the monthly advance\/decline lines are still positive For new opportunities, I will be watching those ETFs and stocks that are trading above their yearly pivots. As previously discussed these pivots are based on the price range for 2024 and are valid for the entire year. Those stocks or ETFs that are trading above these pivots would have the first targets at the yearly R1 levels. (Note: If you use Stockcharts.com selecting pivots with a weekly chart will give you all of the yearly pivot levels) Yearly ETF Pivots As of the close on March 28, those ETFs that closed above the yearly pivots are highlighted in green. Several former market-leading ETFs like QQQ, XLK, SMH, and XLY have closed below the yearly pivots for two or more weeks in a row which is consistent with new negative trends. These pivots will now act as resistance. The positive ETFs will be favored for new long positions once the daily technical indicators are positive. In addition to the precious metal ETFs like GLD and SLV, XLE, XLP, XLI, and XCI are acting the most interesting as long as they do not have a weekly close below their yearly pivots. SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) Monthly The monthly chart of the SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) shows that it traded above its monthly starc+ band in March. After already exceeding the yearly R1 it is clearly in a high-risk buy area and a low-risk sell zone. Partial profits in GLD were therefore taken on Friday\u2019s strong open. That does not mean that it can\u2019t go even higher. Similar screening will be used to select the most promising stocks within these positive sectors. The 1st lower quarter lower closes for SPY and QQQ are the first since the fall of 2022 but the evidence suggests most of the weak long positions have already been sold. That could mean it will be one of those buy before May years.","label":1}

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"Senior Correspondent John Santora, CEO of WeWork Senior Correspondent You probably know the story of the crash and burn of WeWork, the co-working startup that, under founder Adam Neumann, soared to a valuation of $47 billion before eventually plummeting to bankruptcy in November 2023. (Neumann stepped down as CEO in 2019.) John Santora is writing the company\u2019s second act. The longtime executive, who had been at commercial real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield for 47 years, took the helm of WeWork in June 2024, as it emerged from bankruptcy. He is trying to steady the company, which still has more than 45 million square feet of real estate across 120 cities and 37 countries. TIME met Santora in WeWork\u2019s Manhattan office, where the beer on tap has been replaced with coffee, and the flashy neon signs have disappeared. Santora is trying to make WeWork a more stable and traditional co-working company. TIME talked with him about how he\u2019s planning to do that and whether the company\u2019s business model can still succeed. Advertisement Advertisement This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. You were at the same company for decades; why did you make the leap to something new at WeWork?\u00a0 I was 47 years at one company and have been married for 46 years. I don't change too often. But when [software billionaire] Anant Yardi acquired a majority share in WeWork, I picked up the phone at Cushman Wakefield, as I had for 30 some odd years, and I said, \u201cHey, you just bought a real estate company. How can we help?\u201d\u00a0 We got together, and we talked about ways to work together. And then he called me about three days later. He said, \u201cI want you to think about something. I want you to come in as the CEO, and as we exit bankruptcy, I want you to take it from there.\u201d What made you decide to make the change? It was exciting.\u00a0 At Cushman Wakefield, I started out in an engine room and ultimately became the global COO under a couple of different CEOs. But this was a chance, in my own way, to put my own mark on something. Is WeWork\u2019s business model still the same\u2014that you lease spaces and then sublease them\u2014or is it changing a little? We have three types of agreements\u2014management agreement, revenue share, and a traditional lease.\u00a0 With a traditional lease, we lease the space for a period of time and all the risk is on us to keep our members in there, and keep it full. And all the upside is on us as well. Now we also have about 130 locations where we have management agreements or revenue shares with our landlords. So it\u2019s a little de-risked. In a revenue share, we'll pay a lower rent, but once we reach a revenue of X, we'll share part of that above with you.\u00a0\u00a0 A management agreement is just that. The landlord provides the space. We manage the space and the opportunity, bring in our members, and we have a management fee, as opposed to getting the revenue that we create. So it's an upside for the landlord. It de-risks it for us.\u00a0 Do you own any buildings? Not anymore.\u00a0 And do you see yourself owning buildings going forward? No reason to own the real estate, from my perspective.\u00a0 Are you in expansion mode? We did four deals with Amazon and there are deals we've done with other companies that haven't hit the streets. So yes, we're expanding from that perspective, but we did pare back our portfolio during the restructuring phase. We will opportunistically expand, but we're really being very disciplined and structured in that.\u00a0 I think that's one of the things I bring\u2014after 47 years of experience in real estate, I understand, and have been through all the cycles during those years. So before I make any long-term commitments, or even short-term commitments, we're going to look and analyze it all. It's not a complete de-risk, but it's to manage the opportunity and manage the risk. I\u2019m sensing a theme here, which is de-risking, is that right? Yeah, de-risking yet capitalizing on the opportunity. What's the mandate from the owners?\u00a0 It's about stabilization. It\u2019s growth. It\u2019s profitable growth. It\u2019s about making it a stable, financially secure business.\u00a0 Now we're spending $80 million to $90 million this year on updating our spaces. We call them refreshes. We went through a period there where there was little, if any, investment. We have to make investments. The space has got to be warm and welcoming and usable for our members. There are other companies that do what WeWork does. How do you convince potential clients that you're the best choice? First of all, our brand is great. Our brand is the flex working brand in the world, without question. Nobody has the depth, breadth and scale that we have for all those components: the little entrepreneur, the mid-sized business or the enterprise business. We cover all three. We're not competing on a global basis with anybody. Where do you think we are in the return-to-office push and where do you see it going? Executives are going to require people in the offices, I think four days a week, understanding that there are flexible needs people have. They have elder care, they have child care. They have doctor's appointments. You have to give employees some level of flexibility, but you also have to establish their need to be in the office because of the collaboration and collisions that happen there. Where are we in the cycle? From a real estate perspective, it's settling out. Is there an upside to you of companies still figuring out their policies?\u00a0 Any disruption and movement is good for us. Because we fill that gap. We fill the short term need, we can fill the long term need.\u00a0 Even when they figure it out, there have been surveys that show that 80% of real estate executives and CEOs and CFOs say that 20% of their portfolio will be flexible. We just went through a period of time where everybody took way too much space. You get hit with the pandemic and now you've spent the last three or four years trying to get rid of space, writing off the cost of space. And you want to go back to locking into 15-year leases? No. A lot of our clients are saying, Let's do these two-year, three-year, four-year leases. It must be tempting to see the commercial real estate market as it is now, with the vacancy rate, and go in and swoop up a bunch of buildings.\u00a0 We're not going to get ahead of ourselves. We will be very disciplined and structured and measured in how we take down new space. I remember someone once said about WeWork that it was going to be the next Google or Facebook. Is that something you still see for the company? No. I see the company as providing a great product in all the right markets around the world where our members need us and want to be. We will have very good, reasonable returns for our investors and the ability to pay our people. Is the company profitable? The company has never been profitable. Our last quarter was a break even quarter for us from an EBITDA [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization] perspective, for the first time ever in the history of the company. So we are well on our way. What about the design side of things? Are you toning that down at all? I think our design is getting better and better. It is maturing in ways. You're not going to see the pool table in the middle [of a space] unless it's a demand from a specific client.\u00a0 This office does seem a little subdued compared to the WeWork offices I\u2019ve been in. Is that on purpose?\u00a0 This is an evolution of our designs. If you went into the latest one in Dublin, it would look like a traditional corporate headquarters. The common area has all kinds of mahogany woodwork. If you go into a conference room, you've got the custom cabinetries. The screens are built into a cabinet. Gray marble countertops. It's fun, it's warm, but it\u2019s upscale.\u00a0 Why go back to the traditional corporate headquarters look?\u00a0 I would say it has that feel, but it has enough warmth in it. There\u2019s plants all around. It\u2019s a high quality finish with the warmth of a WeWork.\u00a0 So it's almost like the design went a little too far before? That was the original design that the leaders at that time felt was important. We brought it more towards the flight to quality.\u00a0 You think about what WeWork created. If you went to corporate headquarters 15 years ago, you got off an elevator bank, you walked down the hallway to some receptionist that's sitting there, and there\u2019s a couple of couches that cost a fortune. You waited until somebody came out to get you.\u00a0 You now walk into a headquarters. Forget WeWork. You walk into a headquarters now, there's usually some couches there. Somebody's gonna offer you a cup of coffee. There's TV screens going so you can watch what's going on in the market, or a little video about the company. That was WeWork that changed that. How do you keep that original spirit while doing what clients want? I think that's why clients come to us, because we can balance that. We can give them what they want but with that excitement and warmth and that sense of community.\u00a0 Would you say the company is growing up? It's matured. It's maturing Does it lose something by maturing?\u00a0 I think you could still have that excitement. I love to walk our spaces around the world. And I see the energy, even over the last six months, coming back. That's a matter of business getting better, more people going back to the office, and more excitement around our brand again.\u00a0 At its heart, is WeWork still a real estate company? It's not a technology company. It's a combination real estate hospitality company.  I think a lot of people thought that this was a business model that doesn't work. Were they right?\u00a0\u00a0 It does work. There's a need for flexible space. There's a need for this type of environment, for every type of company. What is one thing that you had to change about the way you did things when you came over to WeWork from Cushman? There was a level of energy and excitement and youth here that I love. I struggled with how I dress, and I'm still in that middle mode.\u00a0 And they picked up a little bit from me. A lot of what I've brought here is some discipline, and some maturity that I've learned all those years at Cushman and Wakefield. \u00a9 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"ByAnthony Stitt  ByAnthony Stitt,  Contributor.  Athletics' Tyler Soderstrom (left) and Lawrence Butler are two of the A's young stars who will play ... More in Sacramento this season. (AP Photo\/Lindsey Wasson) Back in January, the Athletics sold out all their home tickets for their inaugural season in West Sacramento, Calif. The result now: The A\u2019s resale market for home-game tickets is booming. The cheapest available standard seats for the team\u2019s home opener at 14,000-seat Sutter Health Park against the Chicago Cubs on Monday are hitting the $90 range on SeatGeek, which is MLB \u2019s official resale ticket partner, and those prices may skyrocket on game day. A handful of lawn seats on \u201cHome Run Hill\u201d \u2014 the grassy zone beyond the right-field wall, where Sacramento River Cats fans for years have watched games from beach towels and lawn chairs \u2014 are pricing out at around $75. Gametime, a secondary market ticket site, recently revealed metrics measuring the median ticket price at $181 per seat for A\u2019s home games, which ranks as the most expensive median price in baseball, even ahead of the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers, who rank second at $177. According to a recent Sacramento Bee analysis, prices started at an average of about $86 across the A\u2019s opening three-game series with Cubs, with the cheapest available tickets on the lawn and $120 for standard seats in the stands. Not a single ticket on Vivid Seats for the A\u2019s home opener is cheaper than $97; and that includes lawn seats. By comparison, the Giants\u2019 home opener vs. the Seattle Mariners on April 4 is averaging around $55 across StubHub, SeatGeek and Vivid Seats. It\u2019s not just tickets for the Athletics\u2019 home-opening series that are pricier. SeatGeek as of last week listed the average starting price for all 81 A\u2019s home games this season at about $59, compared to $55 for Dodgers tickets and just $21 for Giants tickets. Single-game tickets for direct purchase through the Athletics quickly sold out after going on sale in January. Fans also paid about $183 to $244 per game for A\u2019s season tickets in the second tier of availability, according to The Bee\u2019s reporting. To welcome the A\u2019s to their new home, Sutter Health Park received numerous upgrades, including a new scoreboard as part of the upgraded video experience; enhancements to the natural grass playing surface; Wi-Fi network and technology upgrades; digital displays and audio enhancements; updated amenities in clubhouses, dugouts and bullpens; premium club areas for fans and season ticket holders; and concession upgrades. Check out some recent drone footage of Sutter Health Park: The Athletics, who played the previous 57 seasons in Oakland, plan to play in West Sacramento before moving into a new stadium In Las Vegas in 2028. The A\u2019s will share the stadium with the Triple-A River Cats, the top minor league affiliate of the San Francisco Giants. The ballpark and the River Cats are owned by the Sacramento Kings.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"Login Have you ever found that one skin care product that seems to solve every woe you\u2019ve ever had? Well, that\u2019s how hundreds of people feel about this Three Ships Dream Bio-Retinol + Shorea Butter Night Cream. The cult favorite tackles dryness, replenishes the skin barrier, and evens out skin tone overnight with an entirely synthetic-free formula. And while you might expect a product this beloved to cost upwards of $100, the best-seller is just $37\u2014and a little bit goes a long way. No wonder clean beauty fanatics have made the cream sell out eight times. Keep reading to learn why women of all ages love this night cream. The star ingredient of the overnight cream is bio-retinol, a research-backed vegan alternative1 to retinol that's derived from plants instead of vitamin A. In the case of Three Ships' formula, it's the medicinal herb Pic\u00e3o Preto from Brazil. One of the biggest perks of bio-retinol is that it mimics many of the same skin longevity perks of retinol\u2014a reduced appearance of fine lines, faster skin cell turnover, and fewer breakouts\u2014but it doesn't cause the same level of irritation. Plus, the gentler ingredient won't degrade when exposed to sunlight (although the brand still recommends opting for the Skin Hero Bio-Retinol Serum for daytime use). And while it's best for those who are pregnant or breastfeeding to avoid traditional retinol, this vegan version is meant to be safe for both parties. Just remember to always touch base with your doctor first! Three Ships Dream Bio-Retinol + Shorea Butter Night Cream Of course, a vegan retinol isn't the only reason this cream earns rave reviews. The luscious yet lightweight\u00a0formula delivers a hydrating punch of moisture directly to the skin barrier. It combines vegan squalane\u2014which studies suggest promotes collagen production and strengthens the skin\u2019s natural barrier2\u2014with shorea butter, a lightweight alternative to shea butter that's rich in vitamins and essential fatty acids. Together, these ingredients result in a deeply moisturizing formula that replenishes the skin\u2019s natural glow and minimizes the appearance of fine lines.\u00a0The best part? The cream works overnight. Just massage a small amount onto clean, dry skin each night and let your face (and neck & d\u00e9collet\u00e9!) drink it in. And if you need another reason to be obsessed with Three Ship beyond the affordable price point, look no further than the brand's commitment to transparency. A certified B corporation, Three Ships's night cream is also EWG certified with ingredients that you can trace back to their origin source. Not to mention, the dermatologist-tested formula is hypoallergenic, vegan, and paraben-free. We love to hear it! Reviewers swear they noticed an improvement in skin texture after just one use\u2014and it keeps shoppers coming back. One reviewer with sensitive skin says they have zero complaints and have repurchased the cream four times (we can see why it keeps selling out). Plus, users of all skin types stand by the formula. Whether they have dry, combination, or oily skin, reviewers rave about the dreamy night cream's ability to leave skin \"soft and supple\" with a noticeable smoothness sans excess shine. And if you\u2019re prone to breakouts, redness, or irritation from harsh skin care products, you\u2019ll love this nourishing, odorless option. Shoppers with similar concerns say their skin is renewed and refreshed with less redness, minimal breakouts, fewer wrinkles, and a dramatically improved complexion. Three Ships Dream Bio-Retinol + Shorea Butter Night Cream It\u2019s no surprise this glow-inducing cream has become a go-to for hundreds of skin care lovers. I mean, what\u2019s better than waking up with a fresh, dewy, well-rested face? At just $37, this product is a total steal\u2014but trust us, it will sell out fast. Pro tip: To really boost your morning glow, pair this cream with the Three Ships Day Cream and our beauty editor\u2019s favorite eye-brightening patches. *These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"ByJoan Verdon  ByJoan Verdon,  Senior Contributor.  A secondhand clothing processing center operated by ThredUp, the online resale marketplace for ... More apparel, shoes, and accessories. A record number of Americans bought secondhand apparel in 2024, and more than half of those shoppers made a purchase online, according to the 2025 ThredUp Resale report. ThredUp, an online resale platform for women\u2019s and children\u2019s clothing, shoes and accessories, has been tracking the evolution of the resale market since 2013, with an annual report. While each report has shown steady growth in consumer acceptance of, and demand for, secondhand apparel, this year\u2019s report, ThredUp\u2019s 13th, signals that resale is positioned for a period of accelerated growth. AI tools ThredUp, and other resale platforms, began using in 2024 are making it as easy to search and shop online for secondhand apparel as it is to shop for new merchandise. The growing integration of social commerce and resale, along with price concerns triggered by tariff policies also are expected to boost secondhand sales. The U.S. secondhand apparel market grew by 14% last year - its strongest annual growth since 2021, and five times the growth rate of the overall apparel market, ThredUp said in its report, which is based on research by GlobalData, including surveys of consumers and retail executives. U.S. online resale had even more dramatic growth in 2024, up 23%. Online resale is expected to grow at a compounded annual rate of 13% over the next five years, and double, to reach $40 billion by 2029, according to the report. Globally, the secondhand apparel market is expected to reach $367 billion by 2029, with a compound annual growth rate of 10%, according to the ThredUp report. In 2024, 58% of shoppers bought secondhand, up from 52% in 2023, which was the first time in the history of ThredUp reports that secondhand shoppers exceeded 50%. An even greater percentage of younger shoppers - 68% of millennials and Gen Z - said they shopped secondhand in 2024. Of those younger shoppers, 48% said secondhand is the first option they look for when they shop for apparel, up 7 points over the previous year. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of wild to think that in the younger generations, it\u2019s not just that they\u2019re shopping secondhand, but that it\u2019s the first place they\u2019re going,\u201d Alon Rotem. Chief Strategy Officer at ThredUp, said in an interview. The shift in acceptance of secondhand apparel is happening broadly, \u201cbut it\u2019s happening even more pointedly with the younger generations,\u201d he said. Rotem said a number of factors are driving growth in resale, among the most significant of which are artifical intelligence tools that make it easier for consumers to more easily shift through all of the online secondhand offerings and find exactly what they are looking for. \u201cYou have shopping innovations that make it easier to shop secondhand, so it feels more like shopping new,\u201d he said. Three new ways ThredUp has been leveraging AI over the past year are with enhanced image search, style chat, and improved response to written search requests, Rotem said, Image search allows shoppers to search for a secondhand item using a picture they uploaded from the internet, or that they took of something they saw on the street, and match it to ThredUp\u2019s inventory. Style chat, Rotem said, functions as an AI style expert that can help a customer put together complete outfits. ThredUp CEO James Reinhart, in an interview last August, called the recently launched AI tools the \u201cmost compelling product\u201d in the history of the company, and game-changer for ThredUp. In ThredUp\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call with investors March 1, Reinhart said \u201cWe continue to believe that AI disproportionately benefits ThredUp relative to other marketplaces and retailers, and that generative AI can significantly enhance the secondhand shopping experience.\u201d Reinhart also said on the call that ThredUp launched automated digital measurements during the quarter, which will improve the shopping experience for customers and result in improved conversion, lower returns and increased customer retention. The AI advances in the resale industry are mirroring the rapid adoption of AI across the retail universe. Consumers also are showing broad acceptance of AI shopping tools. with Adobe reporting earlier this month that AI-driven traffic to U.S. ecommerce websites has been doubling every two months since September. Social commerce also is driving secondhand growth, Rotem said. \u201cIt\u2019s the fastest growing way people are shopping online,\u201d he said, and consumers are sharing videos about their secondhand finds and celebrating the fact that they found a great secondhand item. \u201cAll of those things are normalizing secondhand resale and driving and contributing to that growth,\u201d he said. According to the ThredUp report, 39% of younger generation shoppers made a secondhand purchase on a social commerce platform over the past 12 months. Of those, 62% made a purchase on TikTok or TikTok Shop. Executives from the top 50 fashion and retail brands were surveyed for the report, and 38% said they currently allow customers to shop secondhand through a social commerce platform. Another 48% said they are considering integrating social commerce in the future.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"ByWill Yakowicz  ByWill Yakowicz,  Forbes Staff.  Hilary Dubin realized she was addicted to Juul, the nicotine vape that went viral and has since been blamed for hooking teens around the country, while she was at a California ski lodge in 2017. She was 22 at the time and Dubin and her boyfriend found a Juul laying on the floor. They picked it up, took a hit, and found that it still worked. \u201cWe're like, \u2018Oh well, we didn't buy it, we just happened to find it, and now it's ours,\u2019\u201d says the 30-year-old Dubin. \u201c[Looking back], it\u2019s pretty embarrassing now.\u201d A few years later, Dubin\u2019s childhood friend Caroline Vasquez Huber realized she had a Juul addiction after moving back home during the Covid pandemic in 2020. She was vaping all day and knew she had to quit. \u201cWithin a few days, I was miserable,\u201d says Huber, who is also 30. Huber\u2019s mother, a doctor, estimated that she was vaping about 40 cigarettes worth of nicotine a day. They went to the pharmacy, and she swapped her Juul for nicotine-laced mints. But the medical-looking royal blue bottles of nicotine lozenges embarrassed her. \u201cYou pull out a Nicorette, and it looks like you have a disease,\u201d says Huber. \u201cI just found the product so shameful.\u201d Jonesing: New York-based Jones offers subscriptions for nicotine lozenges, which can be used in conjunction with an app, to help people quit smoking and vaping. After Huber walked Dubin through how to quit herself, they had an idea: launch a nicotine-replacement-therapy company\u2014but make it cool. In the summer of 2022, the duo applied to an accelerator program at New York University and received a $10,000 grant. They won a pitch competition at the end of the course, earning $1.1 million in pre-seed funding from investors including Good Friends (started by the founders of Warby Parker, Allbirds and the razor company Harry\u2019s) and started developing an app that uses cognitive behavioral therapy and positive encouragement to help people quit cigarettes, vapes and pouches that customers use in conjunction with nicotine lozenges. After a year of development, Jones, as their new venture was named, launched in November 2023 and raised a $3.9 million seed round from Founder Collective, Next View, and others. This week, Jones announced it has closed a $10 million Series A round, which Forbes estimates values the company at around $45 million. The company will use the capital to develop new nicotine products, hire more employees and market the company. Jones generated $5 million in revenue last year and has a goal to reach $10 million in sales by the end of 2025. The latest startup in the stodgy, highly regulated $3 billion (global annual sales) nicotine replacement therapy market, Jones does not manufacture its NRT lozenges\u2014it buys them from a third-party, FDA-approved manufacturer. And, yes, they do come in those bright blue bottles, the same ones generic NRTs sold at Walgreens and CVS are packaged in. But Jones includes a stylish tin that users can put their mints in to make the experience more chic. The company, which says its customer base is 60% women and 40% men, is also collaborating with the Los Angeles jewelry brand Monbouquette to make a petite sterling silver lozenge box, which will sell for $295 and can also be used as a necklace. During New York Fashion Week, Jones passed out tins of its lozenges to models backstage during Jonathan Cohen, Kallmeyer, and Tanner Fletcher\u2019s shows. The brand is also trying to modernize the marketing and approach of existing NRTs. Jones is using the same approach Warby Parker did for eyeglasses and what Hims is doing for hair-loss treatments and erectile dysfunction drugs. Make buying nicotine, generic Viagra and glasses cool, easy and not embarrassing. However, there is a big difference between Jones and Hims\u2014nicotine replacement therapy is an over-the-counter medicine, so customers do not need a prescription from a doctor. The NRT market is currently dominated by large, multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical companies, like Johnson & Johnson, which makes the Nicorette brand of products, the GlaxoSmithKline spinoff Haleon Group and Perrigo. There are innovative solutions afoot, too: Virginia-based Qnovia is developing a nicotine nebulizer that it hopes to get approved by the FDA. But there are more than enough prospective quitters to go around. With 28 million smokers in America, cigarettes remain the leading cause of preventable death and disease in the United States\u2014killing 480,000 people a year. Which means Jones is operating in a sizeable market that needs more solutions. Jaclyn Freeman Hester, a partner at Foundry, which led Jones\u2019 Series A round, says she was convinced to invest in the company because she believes Jones has disrupted the current market offerings and is reaching a customer base not being served by generic brands. \u201cIs this a big problem that matters? Yes, it\u2019s a massive problem,\u201d she says, explaining that most people who smoke or vape want to quit but are unsuccessful. \u201cThe simple concept is that smoking has modernized, and quitting hasn\u2019t [until now].\u201d Jones has also built a culture defined by grace, the founders say, something people addicted to nicotine, and other drugs and substances for that matter, do not get enough while trying to quit. (Studies have found that a typical person addicted to cigarettes tries to quit unsuccessfully about 8 to 10 times.) The Jones app allows customers to pick specific goals\u2014stop completely, or taper down your use. \u201cWe are judgement-free,\u201d says Huber. \u201cCut back, quit, do whatever you want. For Jones, if you slip up, that\u2019s okay. We celebrate progress over perfection.\u201d And how have Jones\u2019 founders faired in their attempts to quit? Well, they don\u2019t vape anymore, but they still use their own product. \u201cI love nicotine,\u201d says Huber. \u201cI use NRT every day.\u201d   ","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"ByJason Kirsch, CFP(R)  ByJason Kirsch, CFP(R),  Contributor.  Swing trading offers a middle-ground approach between the hyperactivity of day trading and the ... More extreme patience of long-term investing. In the diverse world of financial markets, trading approaches range from ultra-short-term scalping to multi-decade buy-and-hold investing. Somewhere in this spectrum lies swing trading\u2014a method that attempts to capture gains by holding positions for several days to weeks. This approach has gained popularity among retail investors seeking to balance the time intensity of day trading with the patience required for long-term investing. This article explores the fundamentals of swing trading, its mechanics, advantages, disadvantages and the strategies swing traders commonly employ. Whether you're considering adding this approach to your investment toolkit or simply curious about different trading methodologies, this guide will help you understand if swing trading aligns with your financial goals. Swing trading is a technique that captures medium-term price movements or \"swings\" in financial markets. Unlike day traders who open and close positions within a single trading day, swing traders typically hold positions for several days to a few weeks. This approach focuses on capturing a chunk of an expected price movement before exiting the position and moving on to the next opportunity. The core principle behind swing trading lies in identifying the natural rhythm of price movements. Markets rarely move in straight lines\u2014instead, they oscillate between periods of upward momentum (upswings) and downward pressure (downswings), even within broader trends. Swing traders attempt to enter positions at the beginning of these swings and exit near completion, regardless of whether the broader market is trending upward, downward or moving sideways. Swing trading begins with identifying potential price swings using technical analysis. Traders examine chart patterns, trend lines, support and resistance levels and various technical indicators to spot assets poised for a short-term directional move. Standard tools include moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) and Fibonacci retracement levels. After identifying a potential opportunity, swing traders establish their entry points, stop-loss levels and profit targets before executing trades. This pre-planning is crucial for maintaining discipline and managing risk. Typically, a swing trader might aim for a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2 or 1:3, meaning they're potentially risking one unit of capital to gain two or three units. Execution timing distinguishes successful swing traders from unsuccessful ones. Entries often occur when technical indicators suggest a stock is oversold (for bullish trades), overbought (for bearish trades), or when a stock breaks through significant support or resistance levels. Exit strategies are equally important\u2014swing traders must decide whether to take profits at predetermined price targets, trail stops as the trade moves favorably or exit based on technical signals suggesting the swing is losing momentum. Swing trading provides more frequent profit opportunities than long-term investing, requiring less capital than day trading. By capturing price movements ranging from 5% to 20%, swing traders can compound their returns across multiple successful monthly trades. This approach allows traders to benefit from bullish and bearish market conditions, as profits can be made whether prices rise or fall. The compound effect of these moderate but frequent gains can be substantial. For example, a swing trader who averages 2-3% profit per trade and completes 5-6 successful monthly trades might achieve monthly returns that significantly outpace traditional buy-and-hold strategies, at least during favorable market conditions. Unlike day trading, which demands constant market monitoring during trading hours, swing trading offers a more manageable time commitment that can fit around other responsibilities. Swing traders typically analyze markets and set up trades during evenings or weekends, then make adjustments as needed during brief check-ins throughout the trading day. Since positions are held for days or weeks rather than minutes or hours, swing traders aren't forced to make split-second decisions under pressure. This allows for more thoughtful analysis and trade management. Many successful swing traders report spending just 1-2 hours daily on market analysis and trade management, making it a viable option for working professionals. Swing trading works across virtually all marketable securities\u2014stocks, ETFs, forex, futures and options\u2014giving traders tremendous flexibility. This versatility allows traders to focus on markets that best match their expertise, capital constraints or risk preferences. Additionally, swing trading can be effective in various market conditions. Modern trading platforms offer comprehensive charting tools, real-time data and automated alerts that were once available only to professional traders. With relatively modest starting capital, many brokers now offer fractional shares with no minimum investment\u2014individuals can begin swing trading with far fewer barriers than existed even a decade ago. One of the most significant risks in swing trading is overnight exposure\u2014holding positions when markets are closed. During these periods, news events, earnings announcements or global developments can dramatically impact prices, creating gaps at market open that may bypass stop-loss orders. A stock trading at $50 at market close could open at $45 the following day due to unexpected news. This overnight risk is magnified during weekends and holidays when positions are held for extended periods without the ability to exit. Managing this risk requires strategies such as reducing position sizes before weekends, avoiding holding through scheduled high-impact events like earnings announcements, or using options strategies to hedge overnight exposure. The multi-day holding period in swing trading creates ample opportunity for emotional interference with trading plans. As positions remain open for days or weeks, traders experience prolonged uncertainty that can lead to anxiety, second-guessing and impulsive decisions. A trade showing a paper loss for several consecutive days might tempt a trader to exit prematurely out of fear. Conversely, profitable positions can trigger greed, causing traders to extend holding periods beyond their original plan. This deviation from pre-established exit criteria often leads to substantial profits diminishing or transforming into losses when the market eventually reverses. Successful swing trading requires exceptional emotional discipline\u2014the ability to stick with a trading plan despite psychological pressure. While volatility creates the price swings that make this trading style possible, excessive volatility can undermine swing trading strategies. During highly volatile periods, markets may move unpredictably, with prices gapping beyond stop-loss levels or reversing sharply before reaching profit targets. Conversely, extended periods of low volatility present the opposite challenge\u2014markets that move sideways with minimal swings provide few profitable opportunities for swing traders. Successful swing traders must adapt their strategies to current volatility conditions, perhaps reducing position sizes during highly volatile periods or shifting to different markets when volatility falls below optimal levels. The fundamental distinction between swing and day trading lies in the time horizon. Day traders complete all their trades within a single market session, never holding positions overnight. This approach eliminates overnight risk but demands intense focus during trading hours and typically requires larger position sizes to generate meaningful returns from smaller price movements. Swing trading operates on a more extended timeframe, with positions from several days to a few weeks. This longer horizon allows swing traders to capture more significant price movements while dedicating less time to active trading. The reduced time commitment makes swing trading more accessible to those who cannot devote full workdays to trading. The capital requirements also differ significantly. Due to pattern day trader rules, day trading stocks in the U.S. requires maintaining a minimum of $25,000 in a margin account. Swing trading has no specific regulatory requirements, allowing traders to begin with much smaller accounts. Trend following represents one of the most widely used swing trading approaches, built on the premise that prices tend to continue moving in their current direction. Traders identify established trends using moving averages, trendlines and momentum indicators, then enter positions in the direction of the prevailing trend during temporary retracements or consolidations. This strategy works particularly well in strongly trending markets. The key advantage lies in the strategy's simplicity and probability\u2014trends often persist longer than expected, creating multiple entry opportunities. Risk management typically involves placing stops below recent swing lows (for uptrends) or above recent swing highs (for downtrends). Mean reversion strategies operate on the principle that prices return to their average or mean after moving to extremes. Swing traders using this approach look for securities that have moved significantly away from their moving averages, anticipating a correction back toward normal levels. Standard setups include buying oversold conditions in generally uptrending markets or shorting overbought conditions in downtrending environments. This strategy performs best in range-bound or sideways markets where prices oscillate between clear support and resistance levels. Traders typically enter when technical indicators reach extreme readings\u2014for instance, when RSI drops below 30 in generally uptrending markets or rises above 70 in downtrending ones. Breakout trading focuses on capturing the explosive price movements that often follow when a security breaks through significant support or resistance levels. Swing traders watch for consolidation patterns like triangles, flags or rectangles where price compresses before eventually breaking out in either direction. Traders typically enter positions when price convincingly closes beyond the support or resistance level, often using volume confirmation as an additional filter. This strategy works best in volatile markets with strong trending tendencies. The main challenge involves distinguishing between genuine breakouts and false moves, as many apparent breakouts reverse quickly. The pullback strategy combines trend following and mean reversion, focusing on temporary retracements within more significant trends. Rather than buying at new highs or selling at new lows, pullback traders wait for prices to retreat temporarily against the prevailing trend, creating more favorable entry points with tighter stop-loss placement. This approach typically offers superior risk-reward profiles compared to pure trend following, as entries occur closer to support or resistance levels, allowing for tighter stop placement. The main challenge involves distinguishing between temporary retracements and actual trend reversals. Swing trading best suits individuals with part-time availability for market analysis\u2014perhaps professionals who can dedicate evenings and some daytime hours to monitoring positions. The approach particularly appeals to self-directed investors who enjoy actively managing their investments rather than delegating to passive strategies but cannot commit to the full-time demands of day trading. Successful practitioners typically demonstrate patience to wait for ideal setups, discipline to follow established trading plans despite emotional impulses and adaptability to adjust strategies as market conditions evolve. An analytical mindset helps evaluate chart patterns and technical indicators, while emotional resilience is essential for withstanding inevitable losing streaks. While no specific regulatory minimum exists (unlike the $25,000 requirement for pattern day trading), practical success typically requires sufficient capital to diversify across multiple positions while maintaining appropriate position sizing properly. Many successful practitioners begin with a small portion of their overall portfolio, expanding their swing trading allocation only after demonstrating consistent profitability. Bottom Line Swing trading offers a middle-ground approach between the hyperactivity of day trading and the extreme patience of long-term investing. When executed with disciplined risk management, thoughtful technical analysis, and emotional control, it can provide above-average returns while accommodating work and life commitments. However, success requires substantial skill development, acceptance of overnight holding risks, and the psychological fortitude to maintain trading discipline through inevitable market fluctuations. While no regulatory minimum exists, most successful swing traders recommend starting with at least $5,000 to $10,000 to adequately diversify positions and withstand inevitable losing streaks without depleting capital. Yes, swing trading is well-suited for part-time traders as it typically requires just 1-2 hours daily for analysis and trade management, with most intensive work often possible during evenings and weekends. Beginners typically succeed most with trend-following strategies in liquid, well-established stocks or ETFs, as these provide more precise signals and generally offer higher probability setups than countertrend approaches. Effective risk management includes limiting position sizes to risk no more than 1-2% of capital per trade, maintaining at least a 1:2 risk-reward ratio, using stop-loss orders consistently and diversifying across uncorrelated assets. The most frequent swing trading mistakes include overtrading during unfavorable market conditions, inconsistent position sizing, moving stop-losses further away to avoid taking losses, failing to follow trading plans due to emotional decision-making, and inadequate preparation before committing significant capital.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":" The original Benchmade Bedlam holds a special place in the memory of knife enthusiasts \u2014 not because it was the most practical tool in the drawer, but because it looked like something straight out of a late-90s action thriller. Oversized, aggressive, and unapologetically tactical, the full-sized Bedlam, with its Persian scimitar-inspired blade and dramatic curves, was built for presence as much as performance. Fast forward to today, Benchmade has reimagined that same bold spirit in a more pocketable form with the Mini Bedlam \u2014 sharpened, streamlined, and ready for everyday carry without losing its cinematic charm. The Mini Bedlam doesn\u2019t fully subscribe to the word \u201cmini,\u201d though. At 8.63 inches overall with a 3.45-inch blade, it sits closer to the upper limits of what most people would call EDC-friendly. Yet, compared to the original 10-inch version, this is positively compact. The blade\u2019s sweeping scimitar silhouette returns in full force, retaining the visual drama that made the first Bedlam stand out \u2014 a nod to Middle Eastern Jambiya daggers that have long influenced blade design. But this isn\u2019t a museum piece. Benchmade clearly intended the Mini Bedlam to be a usable, carryable tool. It\u2019s been upgraded with CPM S90V steel, offering incredible edge retention and toughness, two traits that the EDC crowd will instantly appreciate \u2014 especially if they actually intend to use the knife rather than just stare at it. Designer: Benchmade Click Here to Buy Now  The handle is where Benchmade makes its most subtle, but smart, refinements. Gone is the slightly exaggerated tactical lean of the old model. In its place is an ergonomic grip with finger grooves that don\u2019t bully your hand into submission but instead provide natural control. The steel liners, paired with either textured G10 or the fancier marbled carbon fiber scales, create a tactile feel that balances grip and comfort. The aftermarket-inspired backspacer, with its aggressive knurling, reinforces the knife\u2019s utilitarian edge without feeling gimmicky.    Benchmade could have stopped at reissuing the shape and called it a day, but the material choices elevate the Mini Bedlam into enthusiast territory. The S90V blade stock is a touch thicker than usual at 0.114 inches, hinting at the knife\u2019s intended workload. It\u2019s built to cut, not just slice envelopes open. The deployment stays classic Benchmade, using the AXIS lock paired with a thumb stud for ambidextrous one-handed opening. The lockup feels reassuringly bank-vault solid, something veteran AXIS users have come to expect.    The knife is offered in three flavors \u2014 the 865SBK in all-black G10 (4.91oz), the 865BK-01 with a coyote tan and black combo (also G10, same weight), and the crown jewel, the 865-02, which trims down to 4.67oz thanks to its carbon fiber scales and adds copper PVD-coated hardware for good measure. These little details matter. That copper pivot collar? Completely unnecessary, but knife enthusiasts will grin the second they see it, knowing it\u2019s exactly the kind of flourish that separates a tool from a collectible.  Pricing starts at $350 for the G10 variants and hits $450 for the carbon fiber model \u2014 not cheap, but Amazon does offer a discounted price of roughly $286. And with that price comes the usual Benchmade perks: a lifetime warranty and free LifeSharp service for sharpening and tune-ups, no questions asked (except for maybe why you keep dulling it so often).

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"The next leg of the AI race is on, and has expanded beyond the usual players, such as OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. In addition to the dominance of the tech giants, more open-source options have now taken to the spotlight with a new focus in the AI arena. Various brands, such as DeepSeek, Alibaba, and Baidu, have demonstrated that AI functions can be developed and executed at a fraction of the cost. They have also navigated securing solid business partnerships and deciding or continuing to provide AI products to consumers as free or low-cost, open source models, while larger companies double down on a proprietary, for-profit trajectory, hiding their best features behind a paywall. The latest models, such as DeepSeek\u2019s R1, Alibaba\u2019s Qwen2.5-VL, and Baidu\u2019s Ernie 4.5 have been compared to the top models such as OpenAI\u2019s 4o or GPT-4.5 models. Meanwhile, their codes are easily accessible at repositories, such as GitHub or Huggingface for developers to use on unique applications. Learn more about these open source AI products and consider if you\u2019d be interested in making a switch from a more traditional app. DeepSeek, short for Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Basic Technology Research Co., Ltd., is a Chinese AI startup that gained international attention after its AI models proved to be formidable in quality to those of well-established brands in the industry, including OpenAI, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and others. The company showcased AI models developed in a fraction of the time and operating cost of competitors\u2019 models. The young company has been around since April 2023, an offshoot of the parent company High-Flyer, but has developed several AI models. These include the original DeepSeek-LLM, DeepSeek-Math, DeepSeek V2, and DeepSeek V3\u2013 the last of which was announced in November 2024 and was already gaining industry attention. The brand announced its DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-R1-Zero reasoning models in January 2025, which took the AI industry by storm with comparisons to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 and o1 models. The infamous introduction affected stock prices, made competitors rethink business strategies, and caused security concerns among government entities. DeepSeek was released under the MIT License, which indicates it is as open as it can be without being 100% open source. The company calls its AI models \u201copen weight.\u201d Still, they are available on the GitHub repository\u00a0for users to download and develop. DeepSeek is a chatbot-style AI tool that is available in web-based format as well as through iOS and Android mobile applications. Since gaining notoriety, the company has partnered\u00a0with several companies, including Lenovo, Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu, among others, to use its AI models. Alibaba Qwen, short for Tongyi Qianwen, a large language model family, is among the top 10 open-source models in the world. Alibaba itself is a notable Chinese e-commerce brand. The company announced its first model as a beta in April 2023, which quickly became popular in the AI space as it officially released models as open source throughout the year. Subsequent models have been released as either partially or fully open source, including Qwen 2, Qwen-VL2, Qwen-vl-max, Qwen-Audio, and Qwen2-Math. The company\u2019s most recent models include Qwen 2.5-Max, which was announced in January 2025, and Qwen2.5-VL, which was announced in March, marketing them as more powerful than rival models such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Meta\u2019s Llama-3.1-405 B LLMs. The original Qwen model was based on Meta\u2019s Llama LLM\u2013 another open-source model, modified to suit Alibaba\u2019s processes. Future models have been released under the Apache 2.0 License and can be found at the GitHub and Huggingface\u00a0repositories. Qwen is a chatbot-style AI tool that is available in web-based format as well as through iOS and Android mobile applications. Since its inception, over 90,000 independent models have been developed based on Qwen\u2019s open-source code. The Ernie Bot, short for Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration, is a chatbot developed by Baidu, a well-known Chinese internet brand. While Baidu has been developing its ERNIE model since 2019, it first released the Ernie 3.0 LLM in March 2023. Since then, it released Ernie 3.5 in June 2023 and Ernie 4.0 in October 2023. The 4.0 model was reserved for Baidu\u2019s subscription-based products, while the 3.5 model was used for the brand\u2019s free chatbot. Currently, the Ernie model is not open source; however, the brand plans to soon make it more available to the public in response to increasing competition in the AI industry, as well as due to rapidly reducing production costs. Baidu released its Ernie 4.5 LLM, and Ernie X1 reasoning model in mid-March, which has been compared to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.5 and DeepSeek R1, respectively. The brand has plans to make its models open source on June 30. Additionally, the company announced that its chatbot will be free to all users as of April 1. A future model, Ernie 5\u00a0is expected to be released during the second half of 2025, similarly being open source and free to use. Ernie is a chatbot-style AI tool that is available in web-based format as well as through iOS and Android mobile applications. Since its inception, Ernie has been used as the model for the AI integration on an international version of the Samsung Galaxy S24 series. OpenAI seems to be announcing new AI models by the week to improve its ChatGPT chatbot for the betterment of its 400 million users. However, the ease the AI tool provides seems to prove that it\u2019s possible to have too much of a good thing. The artificial intelligence company is now delving into the potential psychological ramifications that ChatGPT might have on its users. OpenAI has published the results of a two-part study completed alongside MIT Media Lab, which uncovered a connection between increased usage of the ChatGPT chatbot and users' increased feelings of loneliness. Imagine putting your name into ChatGPT to see what it knows about you, only for it to confidently -- yet wrongly -- claim that you had been jailed for 21 years for murdering members of your family. Well, that\u2019s exactly what happened to Norwegian Arve Hjalmar Holmen last year after he looked himself up on ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s widely used AI-powered chatbot. Sam Altman has shared a snippet from a new OpenAI model trained for creative writing. He says it's the first time he's been \"struck\" by something AI has written but the comments section is a total mess of extreme agreement and disagreement. https:\/\/x.com\/sama\/status\/1899535387435086115 Upgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"Tesla dealerships have faced attacks since Elon Musk began his White House role. President Donald Trump seemed to issue a warning to individuals who participate in Tesla vandalisms, as reports of destruction to vehicles, dealerships and charging stations surge across the country. Early Friday morning, Trump posted on his social media platform: \"People that get caught sabotaging Teslas will stand a very good chance of going to jail for up to twenty years, and that includes funders. WE ARE LOOKING FOR YOU!!!\" He also suggested those found guilty of participating in Tesla-related crimes could be sent to prison in El Salvador, referring to the administration's controversial move to deport alleged gang members to the country after Trump signed a proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act even though a court order temporarily blocked the authority. \"I look forward to watching the sick terrorist thugs get 20 year jail sentences for what they are doing to Elon Musk and Tesla,\" Trump said in a posting. \"Perhaps they would serve them in the prisons of El Salvador, which have become so recently famous for such lovely conditions.\" Recent attacks aimed at Tesla have been reported in Seattle, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Charleston and other cities across the United States since Tesla CEO Elon Musk began his role with the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. In a public announcement Friday evening, the FBI said incidents targeting Teslas have been recorded in at least nine states since January, including arson, gunfire and graffiti. \"These criminal actions appear to have been conducted by lone offenders, and all known incidents occurred at night,\" the FBI said in the public service announcement. \"Individuals require little planning to use rudimentary tactics, such as improvised incendiary devices and firearms, and may perceive these attacks as victimless property crimes.\" The FBI urged the public to be vigilant and to look out for suspicious activity in areas around Tesla dealerships. When asked about his comments at the White House on Friday afternoon, Trump called the vandalism suspects \"terrorists\" and appeared to argue what was happening with Tesla vehicles was worse than what happened during the Jan. 6 riots at the Capitol. \"You didn't have that on Jan. 6, I can tell you. You didn't have anything like that on Jan. 6, which is sort of amazing,\" Trump said. Three people have been charged for their alleged involvement in recent attacks against Tesla properties in Salem, Oregon; Loveland, Colorado; and North Charleston, South Carolina. Adam Lansky of Salem was charged with illegally possessing an unregistered destructive device on March 5, Lucy Grace Nelson of Lyons, Colorado, was charged with one count of malicious destruction of property on Feb. 27 and Daniel Clarke-Pounder of North Charleston was charged with arson on March 15, according to federal prosecutors. Both Lansky and Clarke-Pounder have not entered any pleas, but Nelson pleaded not guilty on March 11, according to court records. Attorney General Pam Bondi also spoke out against the Tesla vandalisms, saying on Thursday the three suspects will face the \"full force of the law\" for allegedly using Molotov cocktails to set fire to the electric vehicles and charging stations. \"The days of committing crimes without consequence have ended,\" Bondi said in a statement. \"Let this be a warning: if you join this wave of domestic terrorism against Tesla properties, the Department of Justice will put you behind bars.\" RELATED:  Attorney general calls Tesla arson attacks 'nothing short of domestic terrorism' More Tesla incidents continue to pop up across the country, with the latest occurring in Fargo, North Dakota, early Friday morning, where fire crews found \"a small fire in wood chips at the base of the electric vehicle chargers in the parking lot,\" according to the Fargo Fire Department. Officials said the fire is considered \"suspicious\" and the cause of the fire is under investigation. It is unclear whether the fire damaged the chargers, authorities said. The New York City Police Department is also asking for the public's help in identifying two men who spray-painted a swastika on a Cyber Truck on Thursday. The incident is being investigated by the NYPD's Hate Crime Task Force. In addition to the company dealing with the recent attacks, Tesla's stocks have tumbled nearly 48% this year and in recent weeks, four top officers at the company have sold off $100 million in stock, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Musk, the owner of X, reposted reactions to Trump's comments on Friday, including one that said \"ESPECIALLY the funders\" should be held responsible for these attacks. A spokesperson for Tesla did not immediately respond to ABC News' request for comment.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"Key Points Calculation Overview Bitcoin\u2019s market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the total number of Bitcoins in circulation by the price per Bitcoin. If the market cap is $450 trillion and we use the total supply of 21 million Bitcoins, the price per Bitcoin is derived as follows: This assumes the market cap is based on the maximum possible supply, which is a common approach for such hypothetical scenarios. Assumptions and Context The total supply of Bitcoin is capped at 21 million, a fundamental aspect of its design to create scarcity. However, not all Bitcoins are currently in circulation, with around 19.84 million mined as of March 30, 2025. The remaining will be mined gradually, with the last Bitcoin expected around 2140. This calculation uses the total supply for simplicity, acknowledging that the actual number in circulation at the time of reaching $450 trillion could vary. Survey Note: Detailed Analysis of Bitcoin Market Cap and Price Per Bitcoin This section provides a comprehensive analysis of the user\u2019s query regarding the price per Bitcoin if its market capitalization reaches $450 trillion, incorporating all relevant details from the research conducted. The analysis aims to mimic a professional article, ensuring a strict superset of the information in the direct answer section, with additional context for clarity and depth. Background on Bitcoin and Market Capitalization Bitcoin, introduced in 2008 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto, operates on a decentralized network with a total supply capped at 21 million BTC. This cap is a core feature designed to prevent inflation and create scarcity, similar to precious metals like gold. Market capitalization (market cap) is calculated as the product of the current price per Bitcoin and the number of Bitcoins in circulation, reflecting the total value of all outstanding Bitcoins at a given time. As of March 30, 2025, the current market cap of Bitcoin is approximately $1.65 trillion, with a circulating supply of about 19.84 million BTC and a price per Bitcoin around $83,253.68, based on recent data from CoinMarketCap. The query posits a hypothetical scenario where the market cap reaches $450 trillion, a significant increase from current levels, necessitating an analysis of the price per Bitcoin under this condition. Calculation Methodology To determine the price per Bitcoin when the market cap is $450 trillion, we use the formula: [ \\text{Price per Bitcoin} = \\frac{\\text{Market Cap}}{\\text{Number of Bitcoins in Circulation}} ] The challenge lies in determining the number of Bitcoins in circulation at the time the market cap reaches $450 trillion. Given the hypothetical nature and the lack of a specified timeframe, we consider two approaches: using the current circulating supply and using the total supply of 21 million BTC, which is expected to be fully mined by around 2140. Approach 1: Using Total Supply of 21 Million BTC Research suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s total supply is capped at 21 million, as confirmed by multiple sources, including Wikipedia and CoinGecko. This cap is hard-coded into the protocol, with new Bitcoins issued through mining, halving every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years), until the supply is exhausted. Some sources note that due to rounding in the Bitcoin codebase, the exact supply might be slightly less, at 20,999,999.9769 BTC, but for practical purposes, 21 million is the standard figure used. Assuming the market cap of $450 trillion is based on the total supply of 21 million BTC, the calculation is as follows: To compute this, we can simplify: [ 450,000,000,000,000 \/ 21,000,000 = (450 \\times 10^{12}) \/ (21 \\times 10^6) = (450 \/ 21) \\times 10^{12-6} = (21.42857) \\times 10^6 ] Calculating 450 \/ 21: Thus: So, the price per Bitcoin is approximately $21,428,570. For precision, considering the exact division: Rounding to the nearest dollar for practical purposes, we get $21,428,571 per Bitcoin. This figure aligns with the expectation that a market cap of $450 trillion, vastly higher than the current $1.65 trillion, would result in a price per Bitcoin in the tens of millions, given the fixed supply. Approach 2: Using Current Circulating Supply As of March 30, 2025, the circulating supply is approximately 19.84 million BTC, based on data from Coinbase and Yahoo Finance. If we assume the market cap reaches $450 trillion with this supply (though unrealistic, as more Bitcoins will be mined by then), the price per Bitcoin would be: This results in approximately $22,677,419 per Bitcoin, slightly higher than the $21,428,571 calculated with 21 million, reflecting the lower denominator. Considerations and Uncertainties The choice between using the current circulating supply and the total supply introduces uncertainty. The current supply of 19.84 million is relevant for today but will increase over time as mining continues, with the last Bitcoin expected around 2140, per Investopedia. Given the hypothetical nature of reaching a $450 trillion market cap, which is far beyond current economic scales (e.g., global stock market cap is around $95 trillion as of recent estimates), it\u2019s likely to occur in the distant future, potentially when the supply is closer to or at 21 million. Additionally, some Bitcoins are considered lost, with estimates suggesting 3-4 million might be inaccessible, as noted by Bitbo. However, for market cap calculations, we typically consider the total supply in circulation, including lost coins, as they still contribute to the theoretical maximum. An unexpected detail is the potential for the exact supply to be slightly less than 21 million due to the Bitcoin protocol\u2019s use of bit-shift operators, which round down rewards to the nearest satoshi (0.00000001 BTC), as mentioned by Investopedia. This nuance is minor for our calculation, and 21 million remains the standard figure. Comparative Analysis To illustrate, here\u2019s a table comparing the price per Bitcoin under different supply assumptions: This table highlights that using the total supply results in a lower price per Bitcoin due to the larger denominator, which is logical given the fixed market cap. Conclusion Given the complexity and the lack of a specified timeframe, the most reasonable approach is to use the total supply of 21 million BTC, aligning with the expectation that such a high market cap would likely occur in the distant future when most or all Bitcoins are mined. Thus, the price per Bitcoin would be approximately $21,428,571, rounded for practicality. This calculation assumes all 21 million Bitcoins contribute to the market cap, acknowledging the theoretical maximum and the design of Bitcoin\u2019s monetary policy. This analysis provides a comprehensive view, ensuring all details from the research are included, from the current market cap and supply to the hypothetical scenario\u2019s implications, with appropriate citations for transparency.

The president will unveil \u201creciprocal tariffs\u201d on many U.S. trading partners, and delayed 25% duties on Mexico and Canada are also scheduled to go into effect. The announcement won\u2019t end the uncertainty over the Trump administration\u2019s trade policies, as shown by the back and forth over earlier announcements, and may draw escalation in the former of retaliation and then further U.S. responses, observers have said.  Chris Grisanti, chief market strategist at MAI Capital Management, said last week that he was surprised by the relatively benign market reaction to Trump\u2019s auto tariff announcement, which was more hawkish than he\u2019d anticipated. He now expects new duties on April 2 to also be hawkish, possibly followed by another muted reaction from investors. Economic indicators are also in focus this week, with investors concerned about softening U.S. growth, particularly in the labor market. Here\u2019s what investors will be watching: The Chicago Business Barometer PMI for March is due at 9:45 a.m. EDT. The index may have fallen to 44.1 from a reading of 45.5 in February, according to the average economist estimate in FactSet (FDS). A reading under 50 indicates shrinking. The ISM manufacturing index, scheduled for release at 10 a.m., may show a contraction for March \u2014 49.5 \u2014 down from 50.3 in February. The JOLTS job opening numbers for February will probably also show a decline, while construction spending may have picked up as weather improved.

Trump is scheduled to unveil \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on a wide range of U.S. trading partners; his office has yet to announce a time. Factory orders, scheduled for 10 a.m., may have risen 0.5% in February, slowing from 1.7% in January. The ADP survey at 8:15 a.m. may show that employers added 120,000 jobs in March, up from 77,000 in February. Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler is scheduled to speak at 4:30 p.m. EDT on \u201cInflation expectations and monetary policymaking.\u201d Constellation Brands (STZ), which makes, imports and distributes alcoholic beverages, reports quarterly earnings today. The company\u2019s revenue and per-share profit may have been little changed from a year earlier. Economic data include jobless claims for the week through March 29 and the ISM Services index for March, and the U.S.\u2019s February trade balance. Fed speakers include  Vice Chair Philip Jefferson and Governor Lisa Cook. The U.S. employment report for March is due at 8:30 a.m. EDT, with seasonally adjusted gains in non-farm payrolls expected to slow and the jobless rate projected to rise to 4.2% from 4.1%.

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"Most Americans, including Republicans, want the courts and GOP lawmakers to push back on President Donald Trump when warranted, according to a CBS News\/YouGov poll released Sunday, with Americans largely not wanting the president to seek even more power over the government\u2014though most GOP voters still back his policy moves. President Donald Trump displays a signed an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on ... More March 26 in Washington, DC. Only 32% of Republicans want Trump to have more power than he already does, while 13% think his power should be more limited and 55% think he has the \u201cright amount\u201d of power, according to the CBS poll, which was conducted March 27 and 28. A 63% majority of Republicans believe GOP lawmakers should push back on Trump\u2019s policies when they disagree, while only 37% want congressional Republicans to go along with whatever Trump wants, according to the CBS poll\u2014as compared with 79% of respondents overall who want Congress to push back. A smaller majority of Republicans also back judges\u2019 power to review Trump\u2019s policies, with 56% backing judicial review of the president\u2019s agenda, while 44% believe the judiciary should not have oversight over Trump\u2019s policies. The Trump administration has decried rulings by federal judges that have blocked the president\u2019s policies, claiming in public statements and court filings they believe lower court judges should not be allowed to hamstring the president\u2019s authority. Republicans broadly don\u2019t want billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency to get more power over federal personnel decisions, with only 16% saying DOGE doesn\u2019t have enough say over whether federal employees should be laid off, versus 23% who say DOGE has too much power and 61% who say its level of power is just enough. While most don\u2019t want Trump to have unchecked power, Republicans are broadly supportive of the policies he\u2019s implementing, with 88% approving of his handling of the economy, 92% supporting his immigration agenda, 89% backing his handling of the Ukraine-Russia conflict and 64% approving of his administration\u2019s push to acquire Greenland. 91%. That\u2019s the share of Republicans who approve of Trump\u2019s job as president, as compared with 50% voters overall. Democrats overwhelmingly disapproved of Trump by 88%, while Independents are more narrowly opposed to him, with 43% approving of his job as president while 57% disapproved. That being said, only 22% of Republicans believe \u201cthings today in America\u201d are \u201cgoing very well,\u201d while 54% say they\u2019re only going \u201csomewhat well\u201d\u2014though that\u2019s still higher than the 42% of respondents overall who feel things in the country are going very or somewhat well. The CBS News poll asked Republicans about how they feel about Trump\u2019s top officials using Signal to discuss military plans. Jeffrey Goldberg, CEO of The Atlantic, reported this week on a group chat he was mistakenly added to, in which Trump\u2019s Cabinet members were discussing detailed military operations over the encrypted messaging app. A 60% majority of Republicans said the Trump administration discussing operations on Signal with a journalist present is a \u201cserious\u201d matter, and a 56% majority think it\u2019s not appropriate to use Signal to discuss military plans. That\u2019s lower than the 76% of respondents overall who believe the use of Signal is inappropriate, and is in line with a YouGov poll earlier this week that found a 56% majority believe the Signal chat episode is a \u201cvery serious\u201d problem. While Republicans overwhelmingly say they approve of how Trump\u2019s handling the economy, 43% say the president could still be doing more to lower prices. Republicans also broadly approve of Trump imposing tariffs on foreign imports, with 78% backing tariffs on other countries, even as 64% majority acknowledge it will raise prices for consumers in the short term. GOP respondents appear to buy into messaging from the Trump administration that while tariffs may temporarily lead to higher prices, it will make the cost of goods lower in the long term as more companies move operations to America, with 54% saying the tariffs will decrease prices in the coming years. Republicans were split on the impact Trump\u2019s policies have had on the stock market\u2014as stocks have been destabilized over Trump\u2019s constantly shifting tariff agenda\u2014with 33% saying Trump\u2019s policies are making the stock market go up, 31% saying he\u2019s making it go down and 36% saying the president isn\u2019t affecting the market either way. Trump has taken a number of steps in office that have sought to increase the president\u2019s power over the federal government, including signing executive orders that cancel or freeze congressionally approved spending and decrying court rulings the president doesn\u2019t like. While Trump officials have broadly suggested federal judges should not have power over many of the president\u2019s decisions, it has so far not admitted to defying any court rulings, however, and Trump has publicly said he does not believe he can. Republicans in Congress have so far been largely unwilling to push back on any of the president\u2019s moves, even when they have threatened lawmakers\u2019 own authority, such as trying to claw back federal funds that Congress has approved. The CBS poll is broadly in line with other recent polls that show Republicans are largely supportive of Trump and his policies, but have more concerns over whether he\u2019s doing enough to lower prices, though Trump\u2019s 50% approval rating is also rosier than other recent surveys showing Americans are more dissatisfied with the president.

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":" Florian Busch Architects (FBA) have shattered conventional notions of home design with House W, a groundbreaking architectural statement nestled in Nakafurano, Hokkaido. It is a residence, but also a self-sustaining powerhouse, producing nearly twice the energy it consumes \u2013 an extraordinary achievement in a region infamous for its unforgiving winters. But the real secret to this energy-positive home isn\u2019t just cutting-edge technology; it\u2019s a radical reimagining of what a house should be. For nearly a century, architecture has followed Le Corbusier\u2019s vision of a house as \u201ca machine for living in,\u201d a philosophy rooted in efficiency and control. Florian Busch, however, sees a home differently. He believes that \u201ca house is a plant for living with.\u201d Like a plant, House W doesn\u2019t merely exist in its environment, it thrives in it. It absorbs sunlight, harnesses water, and adapts to seasonal changes, forming a sustainable, self-sufficient ecosystem for the family that inhabits it. Designer:\u00a0Florian Busch Architects       Defying the still-prevalent trend of urban migration, the clients, a young Tokyo family, approached FBA to design their dream home on the western edge of the Furano Plateau. This 25-km-long and 5-km-wide strip in the heart of Hokkaido is famed for its deep powder-snow winters and stunning summer landscapes. Their vision was bold: a home completely independent from the local power grid, capable of generating at least as much energy as it consumes \u2013 net zero. The finished result goes even further! Over a year, House W produces almost twice the energy it consumes, making it FBA\u2019s first building to achieve such a feat. Counterintuitively, the solution does not rely on compactness but on breaking the structure apart.        The site, once occupied by a farmer\u2019s barn, sits amidst active farmland, surrounded by rice paddies, asparagus fields, and irrigation channels. Rather than impose itself on the landscape, House W integrates seamlessly with it. Instead of a singular solid structure, the house is split into two rotated volumes, framing breathtaking views of the Tokachi mountain range, rolling hills, and Furano\u2019s ski slopes. This fragmented design creates an interstitial space\u2014a natural buffer that regulates temperature and airflow. In summer, adjustable louvers cast cooling shadows; in winter, they welcome the sun\u2019s warmth.   Most energy-efficient homes treat solar panels as an afterthought\u2014an accessory added to the roof in the final stages of design. House W, however, weaves solar performance into its very essence. Its \u201csolar skin,\u201d a sleek black exterior, is more than just a striking visual choice. Beneath the surface, seamlessly embedded photovoltaic panels transform the entire house into an energy-generating system. The result? A home that not only sustains itself but also contributes energy back to the grid. Energy efficiency at House W extends beyond solar panels. The home taps into an underground water source, using a heat pump system to generate underfloor heating and hot water. In a region where winters can be unforgiving, this natural, year-round thermal stability is transformative.  House W wasn\u2019t built overnight. Designed in phases to accommodate market fluctuations, its modular structure allows for future expansion without disturbing the existing framework. Even before the main house was completed, the family added a shed and a workshop, early additions that paved the way for potential future expansions. This flexibility is more than just practical; it embodies a deeper philosophy. A home, like a plant, should have the ability to grow. As climate concerns drive architecture toward greater sustainability, House W emerges as a prototype for the future. Rather than resisting nature, it collaborates with it\u2014absorbing sunlight, harnessing water, and evolving with the seasons.

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"We may receive a commission on purchases made from links.   The advent of home video completely reshaped the movie business as we know it. Before VHS became prominent in the '80s, once a movie left theaters, the only way to capitalize on it later was occasional airings on TV, and there weren't even as many channels back then. The market was reinvented once again when DVDs were introduced in the mid-'90s, which made watching movies at home all the more convenient. \"Be kind, rewind\" was a thing of the past. It may seem trite now, but DVD (aka Digital Video Disc) was revolutionary at the time. From easier access to better picture quality, and even special features, it was a game changer. But what was the first movie available for folks who picked up a DVD player? The most commonly accepted answer to that question is the '90s disaster movie classic \"Twister.\" Directed by Jon de Bont, the film centers on Jo Harding (Helen Hunt) and her ragtag team of students who are seeking to deploy a groundbreaking tornado data-gathering device conceived by her estranged husband, Bill (Bill Paxton). As the storm of the century approaches, she tells Bill that Dorothy is ready for testing just as they're trying to finalize their divorce. A shaky alliance is formed as they team up to try and make history. Dangerous blockbuster thrills ensue. \"Twister\" was a smash hit in 1996 that redefined the summer movie season. In that way, it made it the perfect candidate to help launch this new home video format to the public in North America. It's worth noting that DVDs first took off in Japan before becoming commercially available in the U.S. in 1997, the year after \"Twister\" first touched down in theaters.   Before diving into the significance of the \"Twister\" DVD release, we should mention that it is often cited as being the first movie to make its way to DVD. That may not be entirely correct, though. It's complicated. Indeed, de Bont's film was released on DVD on March 25, 1997, but it wasn't the only film released that day. There were, give or take, 30 different Hollywood titles released on DVD on that fateful day in '97, many of which came from the Warner Bros. archives. The titles also included Tim Burton's 1989 superhero hit \"Batman,\" the horror classic \"The Exorcist,\" Sylverster Stallone's boxing classic \"Rocky,\" and the live-action\/CGI hybrid \"Space Jam,\" among others. That said, \"Twister\" was one of the newest, most high-profile releases of the bunch. Whether or not it was the very first DVD to hit shelves is somewhat irrelevant. When curious consumers flocked to stores like Circuit City or Radio Shack to buy their first DVD player, this beloved '90s classic was one of the first movies that helped demonstrate to the public at large why this was a worthwhile investment. For what it's worth, it worked like gangbusters, with the DVD market exploding in the years that followed, peaking in 2005 with sales totaling more than $16 billion. Sales have dried up a great deal in recent years, though DVD is not quite as dead as some might have you believe. In any event, in the early going, \"Twister\" helped cement the format as a success, giving Hollywood a much-needed, very reliable source of revenue for years to come.   In the streaming era, it can be tough for a movie to recoup its money\u00a0\u2014 or make extra money\u00a0\u2014 after it has left theaters. That's not to say VOD or streaming can't be a big moneymaker, but it's nothing like the heyday of DVD. \"Twister\" is a prime example of just how lucrative that business once was. De Bont's film was the top-selling VHS in 1996 before arriving on DVD, meaning that an entirely new revenue stream was opened up. Over the years, Universal has released the film on DVD several more times before eventually bringing it to Blu-ray and, more recently, on 4K Ultra HD in 2024, timed to the release of \"Twisters.\" Universal has been able to capitalize on this movie time and time again on home video in various formats, not to mention all of the cable TV revenue over the years. In no small part thanks to getting in on the DVD craze early, \"Twister\" enjoyed a very long second life beyond the big screen. Unfortunately, in the streaming era, even certain hit movies run the risk of being lost to time once their streaming tile disappears from the homepage months after its initial release. Can Lee Isaac Chung's sequel \"Twisters\" live on as long as its predecessor did? That's a big question. People are more likely to stream it and move on. In 1997, people were watching that cow fly through the air over and over again without having to rewind a tape. You can grab \"Twister\" on 4K Ultra HD or DVD from Amazon.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-30","content":"Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. Published onMarch 30, 2025 As hard as it is to believe, we\u2019re just a few short months away from Android 16\u2019s public release. We\u2019ve had Developer Previews since last November and beta releases since January, and we\u2019re expecting the final release to be ready in May or June. So far, the update hasn\u2019t given us much to look forward to. There are loads of developer-focused and under-the-hood tweaks, but in terms of exciting user-facing changes, Android 16 has been lacking. Outside of improvements to the photo picker, Live Updates notifications, and improving app support for tablets and foldables, it\u2019s shaping up to be a pretty dull update. Thankfully, it looks like things are taking a turn for the better. Google released Android 16 Beta 3 on March 13, and hiding inside this release are a handful of small yet promising new features. I have to admit, they\u2019ve made me significantly more excited about Android 16 than I previously was. The first \u2014 and arguably biggest \u2014 change I\u2019m excited about is the overhauled Quick Settings. Quick Settings in \u201cstock\u201d Android has largely stayed the same since Android 13, but Android 16 will introduce a new split design. Instead of seeing your notifications and Quick Settings on the same page, Android 16 will split them across two pages. You\u2019ll get your notifications when you swipe down from the top left corner and your Quick Settings after swiping down from the top right. I could take or leave the split design itself. What I\u2019m most geeked about is the new look of the Quick Settings page. For one, your Quick Settings are now vertically scrolling and take up the entire page \u2014 meaning you\u2019ll be able to fit a lot\u00a0more toggles on your screen. As it stands today, Android 15 on a Pixel shows just eight Quick Settings toggles at a time. However, with this new design in Android 16, you\u2019ll be able to see an appropriate 16 (or more) buttons at once. That\u2019s a big upgrade. Furthermore, Google appears to be experimenting with additional toggle sizes and designs, including a new small square that takes up half the space of the standard rectangle buttons. As visually pleasing as the big, rectangular bubbles may be, I\u2019m really glad that more practical designs are coming with Android 16. The smaller icons still look great while letting you squeeze much more functionality on your screen. That\u2019s a win-win if you ask me. Finally, in addition to being more practical, I also love that Google is opening up Quick Settings to more user customization. Especially compared to skins like One UI and OxygenOS, stock Android has paled in comparison with giving you full control over what your Quick Settings look and feel like. For that to finally be changing in Android 16 is a big deal to me. The biggest downside is that this new Quick Settings\/notification panel likely won\u2019t be ready in time for the first stable Android 16 release. However, we should see it with a future Android 16 update down the road, and I cannot wait for it. In Android 15, home screen customization for Pixel phones is pretty basic. You have some app grid choices, accent color selections, and the option to theme your app icons with the accent color you choose. And \u2026 that\u2019s about it. But Android 16 will add another option to the mix: app icon shapes. Although not live in Android 16 Beta 3, we managed to enable the functionality, and it works as you\u2019d expect. In a new \u201cApp shape & layout\u201d page, you can choose one of six shapes to apply to all your app icons. Some are straightforward, like a circle or a squircle, while others have more unusual designs \u2014 including \u201cfour-sided cookie\u201d and \u201ccomplex clover.\u201d Although I don\u2019t like how all of these look, I do love seeing Google bring more customization options to the Pixel Launcher. App icon customization has been a pillar of third-party Android skins and launchers for years, yet Google\u2019s Pixel Launcher has always lagged in this department. I\u2019m also encouraged that this is a sign of even more yet to come \u2014 such as custom icon pack support or customizing app icons on an individual basis. This is one of the reasons I\u2019ve preferred using OxygenOS 15 so much recently, and I\u2019m thrilled to see Android 16 is taking steps to improve things here. This one may or may not be ready in time for the first Android 16 public release, but I\u2019m crossing my fingers that it is. This last Android 16 feature isn\u2019t technically part of Android 16 Beta 3. However, Google did confirm its existence recently as something that\u2019ll be a part of Android 16 QPR1, which is set for a September rollout. The feature I\u2019m talking about is lock screen widgets. Google added lock screen widgets specifically for Android tablets last year, but Android 16 will bring them to phones, too. As someone who carries an iPhone and an Android phone, lock screen widgets with iOS 16 has been one of my favorite new iOS features in recent years. Customizing my lock screen to show my shopping list, upcoming calendar events, a Google Maps search widget, or even a shortcut to ChatGPT is equally cool and convenient. I\u2019m a big widget fan, but it doesn\u2019t take long to run out of home screen space to put said widgets. The lock screen is a great canvas for them, especially to quickly glance at your calendar or to-do list, or to display some Google Photos memories. Admittedly, it is a bit silly to champion Google for re-adding a feature that previously existed with Android 4.2 (and was then removed with Android 5.0), but I\u2019m still very happy to see lock screen widgets make a return. While certainly not the most thrilling Android update we\u2019ve ever had, Android 16 is shaping up nicely and coming into focus better than it was a couple of weeks ago. Much of the update is still centered on behind-the-scenes changes you and I won\u2019t immediately notice, but it\u2019s reassuring that some user-facing goodies will give us new toys to play with. With a revamped Quick Settings and notification panel, new app icon customization options, and the reintroduction of lock screen widgets, I don\u2019t think we can call Android 16 \u201cboring\u201d any longer. We should get a better look at these changes during Google I\/O in May, and it\u2019s also possible that Google will show additional Android 16 features that haven\u2019t been revealed yet. Even if it\u2019s not the massive revamp that Android 13 was, there are exciting changes here, and I\u2019m looking forward to getting my hands on them.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-30","content":" \tFox News host Maria Bartiromo pressed White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett about how President Donald Trump's \"tariffs on screws\" were \"going to raise prices\" for consumers.   \tDuring a Sunday interview, Hassett admitted that he had little idea what new economic policies Trump would impose in the coming week.   \t\"I can't give you any forward-looking guidance on what's going to happen this week,\" Hassett said. \"The president has got a heck of a lot of analysis before him, and he's going to make the right choice, I'm sure.\"   \tBartiromo noted that it could take companies two to three years to shift manufacturing to the U.S. despite the tariffs.   \t\"But what do you want to say to people who are questioning this as they see the stock market sell off?\" she asked Hassett. \"How long would you expect this disruption to last? The Wall Street Journal out with a piece this morning.\"   \t\"Tariffs on screws are already hitting manufacturers, meanwhile, meaning that they're going to raise prices,\" the host remarked.   \tFor his part, Hassett argued that Republicans would pass tax cuts to help the economy in the coming months.   \t\"We've got the biggest, most pro-worker tax cut in history that's moving forward at a breakneck speed,\" he asserted. \"And I think the naysayers will be proven wrong if they're a little bit nervous about the blips from this week to next.\"   \t\"Well, there are also questions about the tax extensions,\" Bartiromo replied. \"How will the Congress get it done?\"   \t\"It feels like the odds of this passing sometime in the summer are extraordinarily high,\" Hassett insisted. \"It's a golden age.\"   \t\"Well, look, if you're talking about the middle of the summer, that we'll actually see this begin to materialize, we may need it by that time because it feels like the economy is slowing,\" Bartiromo observed.
