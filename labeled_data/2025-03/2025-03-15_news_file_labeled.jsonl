{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"Business Insider Edition  Many older Americans are at a crossroads: Should theybrave the market and hope it bounces back, or rethink their retirement plans?          Business Insider spoke this week to nearly a dozen older Americans about how they view their retirement amid a wave of market and economic uncertainty. While some said they're fearful inflation could tick up or their retirement funds may not recover, others are more optimistic and expect the market to rebound.               The Samp;P 500 fell over 10% from recent highs in mid-February and 6% year to date before ticking back up Friday, triggering recession anxiety on Wall Street and hitting many older Americans' retirement investments. President Donald Trump's shifting tariff policies and DOGE-led federal government cuts also mean some older Americans fear higher grocery or medical bills.               Many older adults BI spoke with said they feel financially comfortable and will not be significantly affected by federal policy changes. But others said they're scared they will have trouble paying their bills or accessing government aid.       We want to hear from you. Are you an older American comfortable sharing your retirement outlook with a reporter? Please fill out this quick form.           A few older Americans told BI they're cautiously optimistic about their financial futures despite this rough patch in the market.               Karen Keane, 64, said that while she's nervous about the long-term, she's in a better financial position than many of her peers.               Keane worked in finance for a Fortune 100 company in South Florida and took a voluntary buyout a few years ago that included medical insurance, though she's been unable to find another midlevel management job.               \"My money is gone, and I have had to dip into my 401(k) to pay bills. I also lost my health insurance in 2023 and had to go on my husband's,\" Keane said, adding her retirement forecast from 2019 has come up short amid price increases.               Keane said she and her husband are preparing to sell their house and plan to move to West Virginia for lower living costs.               Keane advised taking a steady view of your retirement savings: \"Don't panic and stay diversified. Look at your savings as a supplement to Social Security. Figure out where, why, and how you want to spend your retirement.\"               For some retirees with larger assets and higher income streams, the last few weeks haven't caused much concern.               William Kent, 73, worked until 72 as a vice president of corporate relations and runs a consulting business. Kent said he counterbalances the downward market trend by investing in energy stocks that are up this year. He expects Social Security won't change or be touched by Congress anytime soon.               \"There will continue to be uncertainty as our country attempts to find ways out of our current economic mess, and if Americans don't have control over their own lives and depend too much on the government, they will continue to be faced with uncertainty,\" Kent said, citing federal deficit spending and long-term debts as a particular concern. \"Each of us is responsible for our own actions.\"               Still, even Trump voters who trusted his vision for the economy said they doubt this level of volatility is sustainable.               Joseph Dennis, 73, voted for Trump but wishes the administration's decisions on tariffs and federal cuts were less extreme, adding he's concerned about the market's volatility.               Dennis started multiple businesses and retired at 51 after diversifying his portfolio and staying in conservative investments. He grew his wealth by buying rental properties after the 2007 real estate crash, and he keeps much of his money in cash CDs and money market funds.               \"I hope he knows what he's doing, but I'm not so sure,\" Dennis said.               Meanwhile, the market downturn and policy uncertainty have heightened fears for older Americans in more vulnerable financial situations.               Peter Young, 69, worries his finances will become even tighter over the next few months.               Young retired at 62 with decent savings after years as a manufacturing manager and electronics technician. But after struggling to secure more work and with his health declining, he ate through his savings, had his car repossessed, and lost some medical coverage.               Young, who has terminal cancer, was disenrolled from Medicaid in Nevada last year for making too much from Supplemental Security Income. He anticipates with government cuts and the market downturn, he'll face increasing financial hurdles as his health declines.               \"This country is in for its roughest ride in 80 years, and that will impact us all no matter what,\" Young said. He added his retirement \"sure won't be the Golden Years of Hollywood and AARP, but then again, as trite as it sounds, it could always be worse.\"               Some older Americans with more financial security still feel the immediate effects of Trump's economic policies.               Ed Harris, 69, said he lives comfortably in Arizona as a retired product engineer. Though satisfied with his economic condition, he said he's worried about middle- and lower-income Americans who may experience hardship in the next few months. \"Gas prices, groceries, drugs, and even medical prices are up,\" Harris said, noting he's nervous that many older Americans may be left without Medicaid benefits if the program faces deep cuts from Congress later this year.               Gloria Rodriguez, 69, fears the economy may not improve enough for her to get back on her feet. Rodriguez said her Social Security is not enough for her to live, and she became homeless after her husband died a few years ago. Rodriguez now stays with with a friend but fears she may not find a place to live on her own given rising costs and little income.               \"I am very afraid of the way the world is today, with so much uncertainty and people losing their money and jobs,\" Rodriguez said.               Margarita Sdoukos, 49, and her husband are worried they may have to delay their retirement. They planned to stop working in six years, but Sdoukos doubts they can afford it.           Sdoukos said they have lost \"tens of thousands\" of dollars in the stock market since January and are shifting to safer investments for their 401(k), even if they are less lucrative. She's also cashing out her teacher's pension due to \"uncertainty in the government\" and is concerned about potential changes to Social Security.               Eight financial advisors and wealth managers told BI this week that older Americans shouldn't panic. Now is a good time for those with fewer savings or without a retirement plan to consider crafting one and cutting back on unnecessary spending, they agreed.               \"We don't even think about retirement right now,\" Sdoukos said. \"We're just trying to get through these next four years.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"Business Insider Edition  This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rajan Chidambaram and Renzo Sanio, two college students at the University of Virginia (UVA) and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. The two 22-year-old friends who met in high school are set to graduate in May. In July, they plan to open Royal Oak Retreat, a luxury cabin in Front Royal, Virginia, a rural town about 70 miles outside Washington, DC. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.  Renzo: I've always been told when you're young, it's the best time to take risks. I was just waiting for the right opportunity to find a development deal that I could partake in.               I went to college, studying physics, and eventually added Building Construction as my second major \u2014 but it didn't seem creative enough. So, I added Real Estate as a second major in my sophomore year. I was excited because you can see the whole development process from the start.       Rajan: Renzo and I actually reconnected in Texas. I was working in Dallas and visiting another friend in Austin. Renzo just happened to be there. That's where I first got introduced to real-estate development. Now, I'm majoring in IT and Real Estate.       Renzo: I was working in a commercial-development internship in Austin. I shared the idea to buy investment land with Rajan while he was working at JP Morgan in Dallas, and that was, in a way, the start of our partnership.       Rajan: I've been selling shoes for a very long time, and I saved up a lot of money over the last five years. I wanted to park some of it in real estate. The inspiration to get into real estate came from my dad who suggested I look into it. I already had a lot of money in the stock market, so I wanted to diversify a little bit.               I bought a property on my 21st birthday. It was a single-family townhouse for $295,000, about five minutes away from UVA, so it's holding its value very well. I rented it out to a family that lives there.       Renzo: There was a 24-year-old in Texas who built a retreat for $2.5 million and then sold it two years later for $7 million. And I thought that if I could do a very similar thing, just in a market closer to where my home was, we would exceed.       Rajan: Renzo brought me this deal. He's the one who found it, he's the one who sourced it, he's the one who did the research, and he just brought me along.               My dad started his own company, and before I even explained it, he was like, \"Just go do it.\" I'm very grateful that he had full faith in me to do my own thing.       Renzo: Our property is 2.5 acres in Front Royal, Virginia. We got it under contract for $37,000 right after Thanksgiving 2024. We bought it free and clear.       Rajan: We closed on January 10. We've started clearing the land but have not started putting the foundation in yet.       Renzo: The 2.5 acres are subdivided into four parcels, and the end goal is to have four luxury cabins.               I bought the plans for the cabins for $2,000, probably six months before we bought the land. I had to buy them to know how much it would cost to build them, which would be used in our financial model.               We're using a $300,000 construction loan to build the first cabin, which kind of maxes out our financial capacity. Our finances are limiting us in that sense, so we're going to build the remaining three in phases.               We definitely needed cosigners for the loans \u2014 some conversations with parents and easing their concerns opened up the possibility for us to see this through.               Once we get full-time roles, our capacity for debt should increase. So, we might consider building all three at the same time.               Our financial model projects $100,000 in revenue per cabin annually. While $100,000 looks sexy, hospitality is expensive to operate.               We discovered Front Royal is one of Virginia's strongest short-term rental markets because it's so close to DC \u2014 it's only one hour away.               As for the market side, the downturns aren't really a concern. If the market dips and people find themselves in unfavorable financial situations, we expect that in-state travel will increase, which will benefit us.       Rajan: We expect to be fully hands-on. This is not an investment; this is a business that we're starting.               And I think it starts with the marketing. That's why I'm really pushing content out on my page. We also have a branded page for Royal Oak Retreat, and the whole point behind that is by the time we open, I want to build up our personal brand so big that when we open, we have a direct bookings funnel.               We don't want to rely on Airbnb or Vrbo because they take a percentage of what we would charge. We want to have our own direct booking site.               I think by the time we open, people are going to be so bought into our story. If you want to book out for a whole year, that's only 365 people, and right now, we have 47,000 people following our journey.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"     If you've earned interest on a CD, you need this\u2019ll  when filing your taxes.    A certificate of deposit can be a great way to grow your money at a predictable rate. Unlike savings accounts, whose rates can change anytime, your CD rate is fixed for the entire term, so your earnings are guaranteed. However, the government wants its share of those earnings. When it's time to file your tax return, you'll need to report any interest you've earned on your CD over the tax year. You'll also need to pay taxes on a percentage of it. Here's what you need to know to make sure you're doing everything right. Read more: Best Tax Software of 2025 \"Interest paid on your CDs will be taxed as ordinary income just like wages when you file your taxes,\" said Lisa Greene-Lewis, a certified public accountant with TurboTax.\u00a0 That means your CD interest is taxed at your ordinary federal income tax rate based on your tax bracket. Tax rates for the year 2024 range from 10% to 37% and depend on your income and filing status, Greene-Lewis said.\u00a0 If you earn at least $10 in interest from a CD during a year, your financial institution must report that interest to the IRS. If you invest in a short-term CD that matures the same year it was purchased, you'll have to pay tax on it for that year. If you invest in a long-term CD that matures after 12 months or more, you'll have to pay taxes on whatever interest accrues annually along the way.\u00a0 \"The interest will be reported and claimed on your taxes for the year it was paid,\" Greene-Lewis said. For example, let's say you opened a two-year CD in January 2024 that matures in January 2026. When you file your 2024 tax return, you'll pay taxes on the interest you accumulated in the CD through the end of that year. When you file your 2025 return, you'll pay taxes on the interest earned that year. And in 2026, you'll owe taxes on the interest accumulated in January of that year. You should receive Form 1099-INT reporting how much interest you earned each tax year by Jan. 31, Greene-Lewis said. But \"even if you don't receive a copy, you still should report the interest earned on your taxes,\" she said. The interest you earn on a CD is subject to federal, state and local taxation, with tax laws varying by jurisdiction. Unless you live in a state with no income tax, you should expect to owe both federal and state taxes on your CD interest. Since state-level tax brackets are a bit more complicated than federal tiers, you can use this breakdown from the Tax Foundation to get an estimate of the percentage of your CD earnings that will go to the state government. Note that state laws on interest income vary widely. New Hampshire, for example, just eliminated its state tax on interest and dividends. Fifth Third's CD Maturity Calculator is a helpful tool for estimating your federal and state tax bill (toggle the advanced feature to access it).\u00a0 You'll pay taxes on your CD interest regardless of whether you withdraw the money.\u00a0 For example, let's say you open a five-year CD right now and plan to leave it untouched until the term is up. You'll be paying taxes on interest until the CD reaches maturity, and you'll receive a 1099-INT form for every year the CD accrues interest. If you decide to take out your money before the CD matures, most banks and credit unions will hit you with an early withdrawal penalty. You can deduct the cost of the penalty on your taxes, reducing what you owe.\u00a0 So let's say you earned $70 in interest in a calendar year, but you paid a $45 early withdrawal penalty because you needed the funds before the term was over. You'll owe taxes only on $35 of interest. Your bank or credit union will likely mail you a copy of your 1099-INT form, or you can access it through your online account.\u00a0 The interest you've earned will be in Box 1 of the form. You'll need to enter that number in the \"taxable interest\" section of whatever tax return form you file with the IRS. If you earned more than $1,500 in interest and dividends between your CD and other investments, you'll need to file a Schedule B. Ready to file your return? Check out CNET's tax partners. You can't avoid reporting CD interest on your tax return, but you may be able to delay your payment obligation.\u00a0 \"You can potentially lower or avoid paying taxes on CD interest by purchasing a CD in a tax-advantaged account like an IRA or 401(k),\" Greene-Lewis said. By putting your CD in one of these tax-deferred accounts, you won't pay taxes on the interest until you withdraw the funds during retirement, she said.\u00a0 The upside is that you may be in a significantly lower tax bracket when you retire. The downside is that your interest earnings from CDs will likely be much lower than you'd get from riskier investments in the stock market. So while you can shrink your tax bill with this approach, you might be limiting your overall retirement fund. A certificate of deposit can be a valuable part of your savings strategy, but when you're calculating your interest earnings, don't forget that the government will want its share.\u00a0 Tax reporting has many nuances: standard versus itemized deductions, charitable contributions, mortgage interest deductions and more. It might be worth it to hire a tax professional\u00a0to ensure you follow the appropriate guidelines and minimize your stress.","label":0}

Gen X here. When I was in my 20's, we couldn't afford restaurant food, either dine-in or takeout, and we certainly couldn't pay extra for delivery, except for an occasional pizza night. We made ends meet by cooking for ourselves, or resorting to packaged ramen when we had to. We didn't have fancy $1,000 phones in our pockets that we replaced every year. The cost of living back then was more affordable because we didn't spend as much on things Gen Z-ers take for granted. No, I'm not buying the sob story. When you don't have money, you don't spend it. When you do spend it anyway, you end up living paycheck to paycheck. That's how it's always worked. Seems to me that both you and the parent have points. There is plenty of examples to show that spending habits are skewed, however much of what you say is true also. I would tack onto this the scourge that is credentialism that effectively forces kids to go into lifelong debt for jobs that demand levels of education far beyond what is actually necessary. That is an insane burden. I'm in my forties and got to watch as politicians in the 90s offshored basically everything that wasn't nailed down and in so doing  The demand for college degrees hasn't come from a real need for credentials, but rather, from a widespread *notion* that everybody must get a degree. One of my sons got no college education, the other went to community college and got an associate's degree. Neither have had trouble getting work, with good pay. Yes, there are fields where you need advanced degrees, such as becoming a medical doctor. But most professions, including software engineering, do *not* require a degree, as long as you can do the wor  Yup, 100% correct. The term to describe this phenomenon is credentialism. At least here in the UK a lot of it was sparked by Tony Blair demanding that 50% of the population should have university degrees. If that figure seems utterly arbitrary, that's because it is - when asked by journalists at the time he had no answer for how he came up with the figure. I've heard that in the US, a lot of this is being led by HR departments, but don't know how correct that is. I'm sure there are US HR departments that look at these degrees, but most don't. Mostly, as far as I can tell, the notion that \"everybody\" needs a degree, comes more from the education community itself, and the parents who listen to the hype. There doesn't seem to be an actual driving force behind the perceived requirement, from businesses. Your memories of cheap food are anecdotes that don't hold up when you look at actual data. Since 1990, real wages (wages adjusted for inflation) have increased. https:\/\/www.aei.org\/articles\/h...  [aei.org] This is true for all income bands, low, medium, and high wage earners. This means that per hour worked, people day have more buying power than they did in 1990. It's also not fair to compare the price of day-old donuts back then to fresh grocery store donuts today. There are still day-old bakeries today, and they sti You're right about real estate prices, they have ballooned. But you don't have to *own* a home to live in one. Rent rates have increased far less, more in keeping with real wages. You didn't buy your house on an entry level salary either. Nobody did then, and nobody does now. You also didn't eat out (or takeout) 80% of your meals. That *is* a difference between Gen X and Gen Z. We didn't have payment plans or easy credit, so maybe we were forced to live within our means. But grandma was still right, if you ca  Most of them don't have $1000 phones, or if they do they were gifts from parents. They don't dine out or get takeaways either, they are more likely to be delivering the takeaway as their side gig. It's mostly down to the cost of housing and rent. No matter how you try to frame it, that is much more expensive than it was in the 80s and 90s when gen X was buying their first homes. Do you have data to support your case? I do. Here's a chart of the top-selling smartphones in the US. https:\/\/www.statista.com\/stati...  [statista.com] The vast majority of these phones are in the $1,000 price range, +\/- $200. Data shows that 63% of Gen Z considers food delivery to be an \"essential part\" of their lifestyle. https:\/\/www.escoffier.edu\/blog... [escoffier.edu]  According to the same article, half of Americans order food delivered at least twice a week, while a large portion of older Americans never have food delivered. It is st This is very true. The good old days weren't so good. We older people just remember them as being \"good\" because we were children, and our parents generally sheltered us from the stresses of that time period. Real wages have increased, not decreased, over the last 50 years. Billionaires don't have money, they just own stocks of companies. As companies make money, they get more stocks as that money is used by the companies for example to get more workers, buildings or machines. So billionaires don't extract money from the economy, they multiply the available money in economy and distribute it to working class. Companies that get more buildings hire workers to build, companies that buy equipment offer work for factories that make those equipment. What is extracting money from the economy is the government and normal people. For example when you eat a bread, you destroy wealth by consuming it. When Russia builds a tank and gets it destroyed by Ukraine, government destroys wealth. When you throw your old TV out, that is destroyed wealth.

The price was roughly 3.3x my annual salary.

The kids are being ripped off even as the oligarchs and tech bros enrich themselves obscenely. You are correct. I am kicking myself for not reading about finances earlier.  I paid off the loan early because I just wanted to see the amount owed go down and didn't need the money.  Total paid was $149k, ending April last year. I was also saving for retirement all the way along.  By the end of last year, total contributions to retirement accounts exceeded what I paid for the house, and the value is of course much higher than that due to market growth.  I am currently saving as much as I can to make up for  The number is not completely irrelevant.  I think when we bought, the mortgage rate was around 6% or so.  Mortgage payments on $130K at 6% are still going to be a heck of a lot lower than on $900K at 3%.

The plural of \"anecdote\" is not \"data.\" Not everybody is lucky enough to have parents who can help them out.  Not everyone is lucky enough to get an entry-level job that pays  way above the median salary for the time.   In many countries, but particularly in the USA, if you start out disadvantaged, you are very likely to stay disadvantaged.  Social mobility in the USA is very low and it's keeping millions of people poor.  And it's impoverishing the country, too, because countries with higher social mobility tend to be wealthier overall.

Never  It's not entirely a bad thing to pay off your mortgage early. But, as you discovered, there are better ways to handle your money. The extra that you put towards your home loan could have earned much more than 3.5% in the stock market. And the mortgage interest is deductible, so the net cost of borrowing that money is lower than a loan for something else.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"Business Insider Edition  Some celebrities are ditching Elon Musk's Tesla to protest his work with DOGE and President Donald Trump's administration.          Not Kim Kardashian, though.               Kardashian appeared as the cover star for Perfect Magazine's upcoming issue, which included a Tesla-themed photo spread. One photo showed Kardashian posing in the bed of a Cybertruck, while another featured her cuddling with a Tesla robot near the beach.               Kardashian shared a slideshow of the photos, taken by Steven Klein, with her 357 million Instagram followers on Friday. Some Instagram users criticized the post due to Tesla's newfound association with the Trump administration.               A post shared by Perfect Magazine said the photos were snapped in Malibu, California, last November. It's been four months since then, and a lot has happened.               Musk, Tesla's CEO, has become the target of criticism for his work with the White House DOGE Office, which is tasked with slashing the federal budget. DOGE has sought to reduce the federal workforce and cut numerous departments and agencies, including NASA,USAID, and Veteran's Affairs.                Musk also faced ire from politicians in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, who have britsled at his attempts to influence European politics.               In response, Tesla sales are down in several global markets and the company's stock price has cratered. Critics have staged protests against Musk, and some Tesla owners \u2014 including Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly \u2014 have sold their vehicles.               Amid reports of Tesla's struggles, Trump hosted an event at the White House last week where he showed off a Tesla car. Representatives for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.               Kardashian told The Free Press in a 2021 interview that her political ideology is a mix of liberal and conservative. \"I believe in the rights that the Democrats want, but I believe in the taxes that the Republicans want,\" she said.               Kardashian has embraced criminal justice reform over the last decade, leading her to meet with Trump at the White House in 2018, 2019, and 2020. She also visited the White House during former President Joe Biden's administration in 2024 to meet Vice President Kamala Harris.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"Yesterday, the tj-actions repository, a popular tool used with Github Actions was compromised (for more background read one of these two articles). Watching the infrastructure and security engineering teams at Carta respond, it highlighted to me just how much LLMs can\u2019t meaningfully replace many essential roles of software professionals. However, I\u2019m also reading Jennifer Palkha\u2019s Recoding America, which makes an important point: decision-makers can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. (Or, in this context, remain employed.) I\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot lately, as I\u2019ve ended up having more \u201c2025 is not much fun\u201d-themed career discussions with prior colleagues navigating the current job market. I\u2019ve tried to pull together my points from those conversations here: Many people who first entered senior roles in 2010-2020 are finding current roles a lot less fun. There are a number of reasons for this. First, managers were generally evaluated in that period based on their ability to hire, retain and motivate teams. The current market doesn\u2019t value those skills particularly highly, but instead prioritizes a different set of skills: working in the details, pushing pace, and navigating the technology transition to foundational models \/ LLMs. This means many members of the current crop of senior leaders are either worse at the skills they currently need to succeed, or are less motivated by those activities. Either way, they\u2019re having less fun. Similarly, the would-be senior leaders from 2010-2020 era who excelled at working in the details, pushing pace and so on, are viewed as stagnate in their careers so are still finding it difficult to move into senior roles. This means that many folks feel like the current market has left them behind. This is, of course, not universal. It is a general experience that many people are having. Many people are not having this experience. The technology transition to Foundational models \/ LLMs as a core product and development tool is causing many senior leaders\u2019 hard-earned playbooks to be invalidated. Many companies that were stable, durable market leaders are now in tenuous positions because foundational models threaten to erode their advantage. Whether or not their advantage is truly eroded is uncertain, but it is clear that usefully adopting foundational models into a product requires more than simply shoving an OpenAI\/Anthropic API call in somewhere. Instead, you have to figure out how to design with progressive validation, with critical data validated via human-in-the-loop techniques before it is used in a critical workflow. It also requires designing for a rapidly improving toolkit: many workflows that were laughably bad in 2023 work surprisingly well with the latest reasoning models. Effective product design requires architecting for both massive improvement, and no improvement at all, of models in 2026-2027. This is equally true of writing software itself. There\u2019s so much noise about how to write software, and much of it\u2019s clearly propaganda\u2013this blog\u2019s opening anecdote regarding the tj-actions repository prove that expertise remains essential\u2013but parts of it aren\u2019t. I spent a few weeks in the evenings working on a new side project via Cursor in January, and I was surprised at how much my workflow changed even through Cursor itself was far from perfect. Even since then, Claude has advanced from 3.5 to 3.7 with extended thinking. Again, initial application development might easily be radically different in 2027, or it might be largely unchanged after the scaffolding step in complex codebases. (I\u2019m also curious to see if context window limitations drive another flight from monolithic architectures.) Sitting out this transition, when we are relearning how to develop software, feels like a high risk proposition. Your well-honed skills in team development are already devalued today relative to three years ago, and now your other skills are at risk of being devalued as well. Valuations and funding are relatively less accessible to non-AI companies than they were three years ago. Certainly elite companies are doing alright, whether or not they have a clear AI angle, but the cutoff for remaining elite has risen. Simultaneously, the public markets are challenged, which means less willingness for both individuals and companies to purchase products, which slows revenue growth, further challenging valuations and funding. The consequence of this if you\u2019re at a private, non-AI company, is that you\u2019re likely to hire less, promote less, see less movement in pay bands, and experience a less predictable path to liquidity. It also means fewer open roles at other companies, so there\u2019s more competition when attempting to trade up into a larger, higher compensated role at another company. The major exception to this is joining an AI company, but generally those companies are in extremely competitive markets and are priced more appropriately for investors managing a basket of investments than for employees trying to deliver a predictable return. If you join one of these companies today, you\u2019re probably joining a bit late to experience a big pop, your equity might go to zero, and you\u2019ll be working extremely hard for the next five to seven years. This is the classic startup contract, but not necessarily the contract that folks have expected over the past decade as maximum compensation has generally come from joining a later-stage company or member of the Magnificent Seven. As companies respond to the reduced valuations and funding, they are pushing their teams harder to find growth with their existing team. In the right environment, this can be motivating, but people may have opted into to a more relaxed experience that has become markedly less relaxed without their consent. If you pull all those things together, you\u2019re essentially in a market where profit and pace are fixed, and you have to figure out how you personally want to optimize between people, prestige and learning. Whereas a few years ago, I think these variables were much more decoupled, that is not what I hear from folks today, even if their jobs were quite cozy a few years ago. Going a bit further, I know folks who are good at their jobs, and have been struggling to find something meaningful for six-plus months. I know folks who are exceptionally strong candidates, who can find reasonably good jobs, but even they are finding that the sorts of jobs they want simply don\u2019t exist right now. I know folks who are strong candidates but with some oddities in their profile, maybe too many short stints, who are now being filtered out because hiring managers need some way to filter through the higher volume of candidates. I can\u2019t give advice on what you should do, but if you\u2019re finding this job market difficult, it\u2019s certainly not personal. My sense is that\u2019s basically the experience that everyone is having when searching for new roles right now. If you are in a role today that\u2019s frustrating you, my advice is to try harder than usual to find a way to make it a rewarding experience, even if it\u2019s not perfect. I also wouldn\u2019t personally try to sit this cycle out unless you\u2019re comfortable with a small risk that reentry is quite difficult: I think it\u2019s more likely that the ecosystem is meaningfully different in five years than that it\u2019s largely unchanged. Altogether, this hasn\u2019t really been the advice that anyone wanted when they chatted with me, but it seems to generally have resonated with them as a realistic appraisal of the current markets. Hopefully there\u2019s something useful for you in here as well. Hi folks. I'm Will Larson.If you're looking to reach out to me, here are ways I help.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"Business Insider Edition  DraftKings is modeling its online casino experience after Netflix as it expands its focus on original games.          Chief Product Officer Corey Gottlieb said Netflix's content recommendations inspired his team at DraftKings. He spoke in March at Next.io's Next\u00a0Summit, a gambling conference in New York.               Netflix's app is known for surfacing shows and movies based on what users have watched, grouping titles in unique categories, and puttinghighlights,\u00a0like new releases or\u00a0Christmas movies around the holidays, at the top of the homepage.               Swiping through DraftKings' casino app, users can similarly find \"lobbies\" with carousels of games. They include the top 10 slots or table games, titles that are \"only at DraftKings,\" recently played games, suggested games for a particular user, and games grouped by themes like \"spin the wheel.\" The app even has an \"Easter Hunt\" section right now with spring-themed games like \"Charmed Rabbits\" and \"Celtic Gold.\"               \"It was really modeled after Netflix from a content delivery perspective,\" Gottlieb said. \"This next-gen lobby product we've created essentially allows our operators to manage dozens of lobbies concurrently with one another, and every lobby is themed.\"               Gottlieb said there are also lobbies tailored for different types of bettors like VIPs and casual gamers.               The Netflix model is part of DraftKings' merchandising strategy, one of three pillars of its product plan that also includes in-house content and gamification.               DraftKings has doubled down on original content to propel its casino business. Gottlieb said the company now produces 110 original titles through its casino studio, which made up about half of the amount wagered on its casino games last year, a metric known as handle. That was out of the thousands of games it offers.               While online casino gambling is legal in a small portion of the US, the business is key to DraftKings' future because of its growth potential. DraftKings acquired Golden Nugget Online Gaming and software company Blue Ribbon a few years ago to pave its entry into the space. It's also bet on adjacent areas like digital lottery through the purchase of Jackpocket.               DraftKings' revenue from its online casino, referred to as igaming, grew about 21% year over year in the fourth quarter to $426 million, according to a financial presentation. Overall revenue for the period was up 13% year over year.               Gottlieb said producing in-house content is part of a larger plan to create more originals across its business, including the sportsbook.               It's creating more of its own bets, rather than relying on third parties for live betting or same-game parlays on different outcomes within a game.               \"We have made a major investment both in bringing new content to market,\" and in \"bringing that content in-house,\" Gottlieb said, referring to betting markets.               He said this gives DraftKings more control over areas like pricing and the types of bets it offers, helping the company stand out in a \"very redundant\" marketplace.               Gottlieb said that by the end of 2025, all DraftKings' live and in-game betting content will be in-house.               \"The goal for us initially was, how do we just sort of reduce a third-party dependency, create some cost savings?\" Gottlieb said. \"And what we sort of found our way into was a fully functional end-to-end studio with everything from game development to in-house.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"Business Insider Edition  Beating the S&P 500's 23% gain in 2024 was no easy feat, but an AI-backed ETF did just that.          Qraft Technologies' AI-Enhanced US Large Cap Momentum ETF (AMOM) finished the year up 38%, thanks to big bets on growth stock winners such as Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Palantir (PLTR).               But this year's volatile market has led the fund \u2014 which uses machine learning models to analyze price trends in the market \u2014 to do some severe rebalancing in March, reducing its tech exposure in a big way.               AMOM runs on a machine-learning methodology called clustering, which sorts data into similar groups. The algorithm examines the price momentum of large-cap US stocks and rebalances every month, Qraft's ETF lead Justin Tam told Business Insider.               \"In simple terms, it means that we're looking at previous momentum to see which one is the best predictor of next month,\" Tam said.               A tech-heavy concentration hasn't done the portfolio any favors so far in 2025, as it's down 16% year-to-date.               \"Going into March, it's gone really bearish on tech,\" Tam said of the fund. The AI model has reduced its exposure from the tech sector from over 40% last year to just 26% now.               Instead of retaining its tech-heavy allocation, the algorithm has diversified more into financials and communications services, picking up companies like Wells Fargo (WFC) and Morgan Stanley (MS).               The AI fund hasn't completely exited or reduced all of its Big Tech holdings in March, though. In fact, three of its four largest holdings are Magnificent Seven stocks: Nvidia (9.41%), Meta Platforms (6.95%), and Tesla (5.19%).               Even though Nvidia beat Wall Street expectations with its earnings report in February of this year, its stock has taken a beating from macroeconomic volatility and technological developments in the AI space. But Tam remains confident in the stock.               \"We do see a lot of signs for optimism in terms of the long-term growth for Nvidia and the AI trade in general, seeing as the data center revenue has stayed steady, which means that the mega-caps are still investing heavily in AI development,\" Tam said.               As for Tesla, the stock has seen a 48% decline since its mid-December peak, leaving investors uneasy. However, the fund is still holding on, with a 6% allocation to the electric carmaker.               \"We've seen it pick names that we couldn't make sense of and have it pay off quite a lot,\" Tam said of the fund's AI algorithm.               AI isn't alone in betting on Tesla \u2014 the company has supporters on Wall Street, too. Morgan Stanley is overweight on the stock and has classified the company as a top US auto stock pick.               The bank isn't too worried about Tesla's decreased sales. \"Tesla's softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive 'pure play' to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics,\" Adam Jones, an equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note earlier this month.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"Folding phones are getting weird, but we're all loving it. Some brands excite me more than others though.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  In the wake of Huawei's Mate XT launch, a lesser-known brand called Infinix also unveiled a tri-fold phone. Although it's not available to buy (yet), it is meant to be a \"visionary glimpse\" of what the company has in store for the future. Unlike Huawei's large tri-fold phone, which looks like a Galaxy Z Fold with an extra flap, the Infinix Zero Mini concept is a small-scale tri-fold phone. It's more like a Galaxy Z Flip or Motorola Razr Plus unfolding sideways. The idea is tantalizingly fun and pregnant with possibilities. There aren't many images of the Infinix Zero Mini, but the available renders provide insight into how the concept could be used in the real world. Believe it or not, I'm more excited by the Infinix tri-fold than Huawei \u2014 or even Samsung's rumored take on a tri-foldable device.  Before calling me crazy, hear me out. The Huawei Mate XT is undoubtedly a gorgeous device. It's the pinnacle of innovation and definitely one of the most exciting phones we've seen in a long time. I live in Southeast Asia, so it's actually possible for me to walk into a store and purchase one; the North American market doesn't have that option. The problem is, though, that innovation is expensive. In my locale, the Mate XT is priced at RM14,999, which is about $3,372 when converted to USD. Even if I dared to dream about owning one, I'd have to consider selling one of my kidneys. To be fully candid, that's the amount I spent to purchase my car. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android In fact, almost all foldable phones are steeply priced. But Huawei has given us the most expensive folding phone the world has ever seen. So yes, even though the Mate XT is a marvel of this technological era, and I do find it invigorating, the device has an unrealistic appeal. I can't afford to buy it, and even if I could, I don't imagine myself shelling out that much dough for a phone. Heck, I'd rather buy another car with that amount!  I don't want to put a damper on your enthusiasm. Feats such as the one Huawei achieved should be celebrated. And if you're a person with that much spare cash to burn, by all means, you should get the device. It's an absolutely lovely piece of technology. As for myself, I've turned my gaze towards more humble brands such as Infinix and TECNO because they feel more realistically accessible. Also, Motorola doesn't sell foldables in my region despite selling some attractive, low-priced flip phones like the Razr 2024. I think Infinix can actually bring the concept tri-fold to life \u2014 and sell it at a more easily digestible price. It feels like yesterday when TECNO first debuted the impossibly affordable Phantom V Flip. I was stunned when the $600 price was revealed, and then impressed when the brand did it again with the Phantom V Flip 2. Here's a little-known fact: Infinix and TECNO are both owned by smartphone manufacturer Transsion Holdings, much like BBK Electronics owns OnePlus, OPPO, Vivo, and Realme. This means that the sister brands most probably have access to each other's research and development. This leads me to believe that if TECNO can do it, so can Infinix. The tri-fold might not be as cheap as the $700 Phantom V Flip 2, but it'll definitely be a whole lot cheaper than the $3,300 Huawei Mate XT. And this is the main reason why the Infinix Zero Mini tri-fold, to me, is a lot more exciting. Namerah enjoys geeking out over accessories, gadgets, and all sorts of smart tech.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"Business Insider Edition  A quiet, sunny day is suddenly interrupted by the hum of a Russian drone. Moments later, another appears. Then another. Suddenly, they're crisscrossing in the sky as cruise missiles soar overhead. It is fast becoming impossible to shoot everything down.          This overwhelming scenario is one that Ukraine's defenders have faced repeatedly over the past three years of war, but when Business Insider experienced it, the Russian attack wasn't real.               BI recently visited a training center in Kyiv where Ukrainian forces from across the military use highly immersive virtual reality simulators to get ready for a fight \u2014 engaging lethal Russian threats like drones, missiles, and aircraft.               Ukrainian technology company PSS by Logics7 makes these simulators. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops have used the company's systems to sharpen their combat skills and train for real-life battles,\u00a0ones in which failing to shoot down an enemy threat can have deadly consequences.               \"Future training systems will be only in virtual space,\" PSS founder Igor Belov told BI in an interview. \"We do it right now.\"               The training simulators offer Ukrainian soldiers a cheaper and faster training process. They get the same feel for the weapon without expending valuable ammunition. It's also a safer way to practice and learn, as Russia has demonstrated that it will launch deadly strikes on Ukraine's training grounds.               BI observed Ukrainian soldiers training on the American-made .50-caliber M2 Browning machine gun and FIM-92 Stinger, and Soviet-era 9K38 Igla. The training weapons mimic the real deal in appearance, weight, and touch, so the soldiers develop strong muscle memory habits and become familiar with the systems.               The Browning is a popular weapon for Ukrainian mobile air defense units tasked with shooting down Russian drones like the Shahed-136, Iranian-made loitering munitions; Russia also has its own domestically produced version. The heavy machine guns are often mounted in the beds of ordinary pickup trucks. The Stinger and Igla, meanwhile, are man-portable air-defense systems, or MANPADS. These shoulder-launched weapons can fire missiles at higher-threat targets like planes, helicopters, and even cruise missiles.               The soldiers wear virtual-reality goggles and are placed in simulated battlefield scenarios. An operator can customize the combat experience, such as having drones attack from different directions or changing the weather to a low-visibility fog, making it significantly more challenging to spot and defend against threats.               Igor said the simulators make the soldiers more effective in actual combat scenarios, and the soldiers can attest to that.               Vitaliy, a Ukrainian soldier in an anti-aircraft unit, told BI through a translator that there's a clear difference between the simulation and firing a real gun on the battlefield. But the VR experience helps provide that muscle memory and feel that makes it easier to use the weapons in real life.               Vitaliy, who is identified only by his first name for security purposes, said training on the Stinger is easier than the Igla because the American launcher provides its operator with two chances to hit a target, whereas the Soviet system only gives one. He has been in combat before, but the training helps him keep his edge.               Soldiers serving in a mobile air defense unit on the outskirts of Kyiv told BI in a separate interview that simulator training helped them hone their skills on the Browning machine gun.               At the facility in Kyiv, this reporter tested the Browning simulator. It was manageable at first to shoot down a few slow-moving Shahed drones traveling in a straight line, leading the airborne threats by aiming just a little ahead of the drone to ensure the interception was perfectly timed.               But as more drones came in from different directions, it got more complicated. Eventually, cruise missiles were added into the mix, and the complex attack became completely overwhelming.               PSS offers soldiers plenty of other weapons for Ukrainian soldiers to train with beyond air defense, such as drones, small arms, or anti-tank weapons, like the Next-generation Light Anti-tank Weapon, or NLAW.               The simulator service is offered to the Ukrainian military at no cost as it wages war against the Russian invasion force, but Igor said PSS can still sell its product and wants to put it on the international market for foreign militaries to try.               \"This system can be the main system for training in the whole world,\" Igor said. \"It's necessary to develop as fast as we can.\"               VR and AR training is a highly sought-after training capability. Ukraine is not the only military that uses augmented reality to train on different weapons. Last year, this reporter visited a facility at Oklahoma's Fort Sill, where American soldiers practice with Stinger simulators just like the Ukrainians. BI has also previously participated in augmented-reality room-clearing exercises at what is now Fort Barfoot.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"Business Insider Edition  Federal workers hoping to jump into the private sector might need to adopt a new skill: translation.          That's because it can be difficult for those in business to understand what it's like to work inside a sometimes mazelike government structure and what skills it requires.               Recruiters and career coaches told Business Insider that many federal workers have the know-how to succeed in private industry, yet they might struggle to make that clear.               Carrie Soave, who runs a career consulting firm in Detroit, said she was once a federal worker herself.               Soave told BI it can be tricky for government workers to convey to corporate human resources departments and hiring managers the value of their experience if it's buried under acronyms or hard-to-decipher job descriptions.               Instead, she encourages job seekers to think, \"What is your success story?\"               Cataloging those wins is becoming increasingly important as the Department of Government Efficiency, an advisory group run by Elon Musk, ushers in sweeping cuts to the federal workforce.               Leigh Henderson, who has nearly two decades of experience in corporate HR, told BI that erstwhile federal workers will struggle if they don't talk about their time in government in ways that resonate in a business setting.               \"Companies want problem-solvers, critical thinkers, and leaders who can navigate complexity,\" she said. The good news is that government workers often have those strengths \"in spades.\"               \"The key is telling that story in a way that makes hiring managers listen,\" she said.               One example: A rsum for a federal worker might run a half-dozen more pages or more. In the private sector, a maximum of two pages is often the norm.               Amanda Augustine, a career coach with Careerminds, told BI that job seekers should remember that everything from their rsums to their LinkedIn profiles are, essentially, marketing documents.               Augustine said workers should make clear the skills they were using and how they leveraged those skills to create positive outcomes.       DOGE-led job cuts have pushed layoffs to their highest level since the pandemic, and more positions will likely be cut. DOGE has said that the reductions, in part, have targeted \"low performers,\" a narrative that some federal employees have pushed back on.               Still, any stigma could prove challenging for one-time government staffers, said Ken Crowell, founder of EmployTest, which creates assessments for job candidates.               Tropes about bureaucrats and inefficiency could emerge as a headwind, he told BI.               \"We can talk about fair and not fair, but you know, at a personal level, it's going to be tough for them to get through,\" Crowell said.               Still, he said many former government workers have vast experience and substantive leadership and management skills that employers would be foolish to dismiss out of turn.               Farah Sharghi, a recruiter turned career coach, said where federal workers wind up in the private sector often depends on their skills.               \"You could have somebody who works for a regulatory body, and then they go work for the type of companies that they regulated,\" she said.               Henderson, the longtime corporate HR worker, said former federal workers could do well in industries that involve complex operations and heavy regulation and security \u2014 including healthcare, defense, and logistics.               She said consulting firms often prize government workers' abilities to navigate bureaucracy and compliance protocols.               Henderson expects workers from some government agencies to appear especially attractive to employers. These include cybersecurity and IT pros who've worked in agencies like the Department of Defense because of a broad \"arms race\" for cybersecurity talent, she said.               \"Government-trained professionals often bring top-tier experience in threat detection, risk assessment, and infrastructure security,\" Henderson said.               Workers in highly specific roles, however, might need to add to their skills if their experience doesn't directly translate to a corporate setting. Henderson said policy analysts, compliance officers, and administrative specialists could face a tough time converting that experience to private industry.               She said workers might need to adjust to expectations that can be different in private industry than in government.               That's one area where so-called soft skills can come into play, Henderson said.               \"Adaptability, strategic thinking, and stakeholder management will be critical for making that transition smoothly,\" she said.

The Leverage Shares 2X Long Coinbase Daily ETF (COIG) is designed to deliver twice the daily return of Coinbase\u2019s stock price, offering traders an amplified exposure to the U.S.\u2019s largest cryptocurrency exchange. The ETF, which carries an expense ratio of 0.75%, is listed on Nasdaq, according to a press release. The launch comes amid a significant cryptocurrency market downturn that saw bitcoin (BTC) drop by around 19% over the last three months, from over $105,000 to now stand at wrought $84,000. COIN shares saw even worse performance, losing nearly 42% of their value during the same period. The new ETF allows investors to take advantage of Coinbase\u2019s stock performance volatility without directly holding shares.  These types of single-stock leveraged ETFs, for both longs and shorts sides, are typically used for short-term trading due to the high levels of risks associated with daily compounding. The profits and losses for both types of these are amplified when the prices of the underlying stocks move significantly.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"Business Insider Edition  Grocery shopping can be a minefield of faux health foods that are biting into your budget and damaging your long-term health.          That's why, when Dr. Tim Spector is walking down the food aisle, he keeps his eyes peeled for red flags \u2014 things that sound healthy, but are quite the opposite.               Spector, a medical doctor and professor of epidemiology at King's College London, co-founded the science and nutrition company ZOE, which gives members nutrition advice, among other features.               He took a particular interest in nutrition research after he had a mini-stroke in 2011. He was just 53, and felt pretty healthy, but he began to take a closer look at his eating habits.               \"I said, 'I need to change what I'm doing and do massive research to work out what I should be eating, what I should be doing, health-wise to keep me living longer,'\" Spector, co-founder of the science and nutrition company ZOE, told Business Insider.               Now, he has made it his mission to help consumers spot \"health halos\" \u2014 misleading advertising on ultra-processed foods making them seem nutritious when they can be detrimental to your health.               Here are four red flags he looks for that can help you spot dubious claims at the grocery store, and how to stock your kitchen with healthier options instead.               Spector said he steers clear of anything labeled \"low-fat,\" which includes margarine and butter substitutes, yogurts, and other dairy.               Low-fat products have a long history in the fad diet industry. The craze really took off in the 1980s because of concerns that saturated fat could worsen heart health and cholesterol levels. Companies selling low-fat substitutes for popular foods also cashed in on the myth that eating more dietary fat causes you to gain more body fat.               The problem is, trimming the fat from a food has a major catch. Since fat brings flavor and texture to food, swapping it out means adding sugars, starches, and binding agent so the final product is still appetizing.               That's good news for manufacturers, who saved money by using lower-cost additives, but bad news for consumers, who are nowmissing out on some heart-healthy fats that naturally occur in foods, and eating more preservatives instead.               The extra refined carbohydrates that are added in place of fats can wreck havoc on our health, raising the risk of heart disease and messing with metabolic health.               \"Big food loved it because it was cheaper to have these sort of fat replacements than actually paying for the natural fat got in our diets,\" Spector said.               If you're trying to watch your cholesterol levels, Spector said skip the low-fat products. Instead, he avoids cooking oils and spreads, and uses extra virgin olive oil, which offers a dose of beneficial fatty acids and polyphenols.               He also buys full-fat butter, since emerging research suggests that the fat in dairy products can have a protective effect, potentially reducing risk of illness and promoting healthy aging.               Labeling products as low in calories is a marketing ploy which often signals a food is ultra-processed and loaded with additives, Spector said.               \"It means they've tampered with it. They have probably taken out some sugar and added artificial sweeteners to disguise how much sugar is in there,\" Spector said.               Many low- or no-calorie artificial sweeteners are no better for your health than sugar, according to a 2022 study.               For example, consuming aspartame, the no-calorie sweetener used in many diet sodas, carriessome of the same health risks as excess sugar, like higher risk of heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. It may also cause you to eat more as the sweet taste prompts your body to expect a boost of energy that never arrives.               Spector has another gripe with thelow-calorie label: calories alone aren't a good indication of whether a food is nutritious, he said. It's more important to focus on the nutrients in your food than one siloed metric. Plus, research suggests calorie labels can be off by as much as 20%.               \"Calories are completely the wrong way to summarize a food. They're not accurate. They're not useful, as most people cannot follow a calorie-restricted diet or calorie count reliably,\" Spector said.               It's pretty common for food packages to declare \"added vitamins\" or \"added minerals\" \u2014 from cereals to juice to milk.               However, while getting an extra boost of vitamins and minerals in your food may seem like a bonus, it's another sneaky way to disguise processing, Spector said.               Ultra-processed foods are designed to have a long shelf life, with a hyper-palatable flavor and texture, tempting you to keep eating. That manufacturing process strips out naturally-occurring nutrients like vitamins and minerals. By law, manufacturers have to add them back in, Spector explained.               That's why Spector is not so impressed by foods advertised as \"fortified\" with vitamins and minerals.               Vitamins and minerals are most effective in the form of whole foods, since they're in larger quantities and in higher-quality form, easier for the body to absorb and use than the manufactured, isolated version.               Food manufacturers will often hype up the appeal of their products by adding very small amounts of ingredients with promising nutritional benefits, even if the doses aren't large enough to do much good. In the supplement world, this is called \"fairy dusting.\"               \"You can claim immune health by adding a microscopic amount of zinc into it; gut health with a bit of manganese all sorts of nonsense,\" Spector said               Misleading health claims also includes labels that advertise added fiber, since you may not be getting an effective dose.               \"Big food doesn't make money out of fiber. There's no big fiber lobby. It's just quiet cheap, and it's healthy. And of course, it fills you up. So you eat less of it,\" Spector said.               The easiest way to navigate food labels is to check the actual quantities of ingredients and serving sizes, to make sure you're getting what you want, Spector said. Not all processed foods are created equal, since certain types of processing can retain the nutrients you want.               Spector's approach to getting enough nutrients is to aim to eat 30 different plants per week, including things like nuts, seeds, spices, coffee, and even high-quality chocolate.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement      Compact digital cameras, aka digicams, are making a surprising comeback. Here's why.    Unless you're a photographer, I bet you haven't thought about digital cameras in years. If you're like most people, your phone takes all the photos you want. What might surprise you (or maybe not given the headline of this article) is that digital cameras are becoming popular again. Manufacturers like Canon, Nikon, Panasonic, Fujifilm and others are either updating old models with modern features or releasing\u00a0entirely new models. The used market is also exploding, with people grabbing up the \"digicams\" that were popular in the 2000s.\u00a0 Even if you have fond memories of your first digital camera, you might be confused about where this trend originated. After all, the convenience of taking pictures with your phone is surely better than a separate device, right? Well, turns out convenience isn't necessarily the main selling point. There are actually a variety of reasons. Five, in fact. So yeah, maybe that beloved camera from your younger days that's been collecting dust in your closet is popular again. It might even be worth a little money. Here's why. Sony CyberShot circa 2005. Yep, this camera (and the photo of it) are 20 years old. As my bones crumble to dust... \"What's old is new again,\" an adage as old as it is new. Every generation is fascinated by the technology and culture that preceded it. People reach a certain age and are interested in things their parents knew and did at that age. See the interest in things like vinyl records, cassette tapes, film cameras and instant cameras over the past few years.\u00a0 There's also humor and warm nostalgia to be had by \"older\" people carrying around the pocket point-and-shoot they had in their youth. Inset: A much younger version of the author, as photographed by a \"vintage\" Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX3 with its \"ancient\" 10.1 megapixel CCD sensor (not shown). Taking photos with your phone, once a novelty, is now mundane. Sure, it captures a moment, but for many, the photo itself isn't special. The moment and the memory it evokes might be, but the highly processed image isn't. Taking out a camera, waiting for it to turn on, and making the moment about\u00a0taking this specific photo\u00a0add to its specialness.\u00a0 For the love of pixels, put that strap over their head. I noticed this when I started getting back into film after I reviewed the Pentax 17. Having your phone out and in your hand, ostensibly with the goal of taking photos, inevitably leads to distractions. \"Oh, I just got a message.\" \"Oh, I should check my email\/Slack\/Teams real quick.\" Having a device that's only used to take photos keeps your phone in your pocket or purse, out of sight and for a few glorious moments, out of mind. (The same can be said for MP3 players.) It's also worth considering that the young people who are driving a lot of recent camera sales grew up with their parents (admittedly, I am of that generation) always being on their phones. Talk to younger Gen Z or older Gen Alpha; many don't want to be online. They grew up online and know better than anyone how awful it is there, uh, here. They want to create a space that's not online, and that's just for them and their friends. To be \"more in the moment.\" Read more: Fujifilm X100VI: TikTok's Favorite Camera Is the Perfect Companion to My iPhone Canon PowerShot circa 2007. Most modern phones can take amazing photos. This is despite having relatively small image sensors and very small lenses. Much of their image quality prowess comes from extensive and impressive image processing. That does lead to phone images often having a certain \"look,\" however.\u00a0 Digital cameras are quite varied and range from old-school point-and-shoots to full-frame digital SLRs and everything in between. Getting better photos from a digital camera is possible, though that's not assured. What's easier and more likely is getting photos that look different from images captured on a phone.\u00a0 Maybe the photos aren't as good, but that's largely the point. Someone who wants a \"perfect\" photo can take it on their phone. If they want something stylized or different, it's hard to beat starting with a camera that creates that result just doing its poor, prehistoric best. Yes, you can add a filter in editing so your phone shot looks more \"Y2K\" vintage. Still, there's something better (and by \"better,\" I absolutely mean objectively worse) about photos from early digital cameras to achieve that aesthetic.\u00a0 TikTok trends often drive the pop culture discourse. That's not great, but it is what it is. Guess what has been popular on TikTok?\u00a0 Popularity on TikTok then spreads to others and eventually to the Very Online (guilty) populace. I'll let you draw your own judgments, but it's definitely a thing and a big part of the resurgence of this once-dead or at least dying technology. So... yay? Everyone's getting into photography these days. In the short term, this rise in popularity severely limits the availability of certain popular cameras. Hopefully, these are finding their way into the hands of people who will actually use them and, even better, get into photography. (Many people buy records and don't own a turntable.) It's an expensive hobby, but one I love and that I'd love to see more people enjoy. In the longer term, it's likely a boon for photography hobbyists as we'll see more of these new, or at least refreshed, models from many big manufacturers.\u00a0 So, have a look in that drawer you never look in or in the deep corners of your closet. Maybe your old \"digicam\" is still there, covered in dust and filled with long-forgotten photos. If you don't want to be hip and trendy with your cool retro camera, there's always eBay.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"Central Ohioans are beneficiaries of one of the greatest park systems in the country. Founded in 1945, Columbus and Franklin County Metro Parks opened its first park, Blacklick Woods, in 1948. Nearly 80 years later, the system has expanded to include 20 parks, encompassing almost 30,000 acres. Park employees deliver around 3,500 interpretative programs annually, and our parks protect 2,500 species of plants and animals. The fifth metro park to be established was Highbanks in 1973. The 1,200-acre park with its 14 miles of trails sits on the west side of U.S. 23, just three miles north of I-270. I was 11 when Highbanks opened and lived just four miles south of it in Worthington. My parents took me there the year it opened, and a trip to Highbanks meant a 3-mile trip through the country to reach it (remember Jerry\u2019s Drive-In, anyone?). Today, Highbanks is mostly hemmed in by development, as northern Franklin County\/southern Delaware County has exploded with sprawl and it\u2019s ever tougher to find natural open spaces. Our parks are much appreciated by people, and Highbanks hosted 1,333,360 visitors in 2024. That\u2019s equivalent to ALL the people who reside in Franklin County. People are not the only beneficiaries of Highbanks (and our other parks). The year after it opened, Highbanks hosted a Bachman\u2019s sparrow. I was only 12, thus I had no driver\u2019s license, but my always supportive parents ran me up the road to see the bird. That was the last territorial Bachman\u2019s sparrow in Ohio. It was once a widespread nester. There\u2019s still plenty of birds, as large urban parks such as Highbanks become ever more important players in the conservation of our natural resources. To date, 203 bird species have been recorded \u2014 nearly half of ALL species documented in Ohio. Highbanks visitors often see one of the local barred owls, and locally nesting bald eagles stage frequent flyovers. All seven regularly occurring woodpecker species can be found, but the star of the drummers is the crow-sized pileated woodpecker. Wood ducks, belted kingfishers and hooded mergansers (in season) are regular sights along the Olentangy River. Tying Highbanks to a much larger bioeconomy are the warblers. Twenty-two species of these small songbirds nest in Ohio, and a dozen of them breed at Highbanks. Perhaps most notable are the Louisiana waterthrushes that breed along streams that forged the deep ravines at Highbanks. This species is now the fourth rarest of the eastern warblers. Also notable to birders are the resident summer tanagers. The brick-red males sing their burry songs from the park\u2019s oak trees and frequently snap up large wasps and bees \u2014 their dietary stock in trade. In all, birds that breed at Highbanks radiate to wintering grounds in Mexico, all of the Central American countries and many in South American countries. Back on Feb. 16, Shauna and I ventured to Highbanks on the heels of a storm that dumped four inches of powdery snow. The park was transformed into a winter wonderland, and our cameras worked overtime to try and capture the park\u2019s beauty. My favorite trail \u2014 highly recommended \u2014 is the Overlook Trail, which bisects wonderful older-growth forest sliced by steep-sided ravines. The trail terminates at the park\u2019s namesake high banks, a 110-foot tall, nearly vertical shale bluff overlooking the Olentangy River. Two Adena culture burial mounds and an earthwork are nearby. If you visit, be sure to stop in the nature center (145,749 visitors last year). A robust bird-feeding operation is easily viewed from picture windows, and the center is loaded with educational displays. Naturalist Chrissy Hoff is a wealth of information and can answer all of your questions. For more information about Highbanks and all of our metro parks, visit: metroparks.net.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"Business Insider Edition  Your next ride across the Atlantic may be smaller than you expected.  Several airlines are flying more narrow-body planes between North America and Europe this year \u2014 a shift from larger widebodies that have historically dominated transoceanic routes.               Data from the aviation analytics company Cirium shows that about 56,500 transatlantic narrowbody flights are scheduled in 2025, a 50% increase from 2019.                 Although some people may see the strategy as counterintuitive \u2014 as fewer seats mean less revenue potential \u2014 narrowbodies are cheaper to operate than a widebody and are easier to fill on lower-demand but still profitable routes.               European planemaker Airbus is trailblazing this transatlantic trend. In 2018, it launched the extended-range Airbus A321neoLR to make long-haul flights more efficient than its previous generation options.               Airbus took its strategy one step further when its \"extra long range\" A321XLR launched in November. The Boeing 737 Max has less range than its Airbus rivals but is still used by a handful of carriers across the Atlantic.               The growing trend is changing how people fly to Europe. Smaller jets can be cozier and boast competitive fares due to their cheaper costs, and their fewer passengers mean faster boarding and deplaning times.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"Last week, in a classic Friday news dump, Apple made the deeply embarrassing announcement that it would be delaying plans to infuse its voice assistant Siri with artificial intelligence-powered capabilities. But that announcement didn\u2019t just send its stock price tumbling. According to a new report from Bloomberg, it\u2019s also caused morale within its Siri team to spiral, too. Per the inside account of Apple\u2019s issues, Robby Walker, a senior director in Apple\u2019s Siri division, held an all-hands meeting for the team and acknowledged that things were\u2026not great. He acknowledged that team members might feel angry, embarrassed, and burned out by the whole situation. \u201cYou might have co-workers or friends or family asking you what happened, and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel good,\u201d he reportedly said, according to Bloomberg. What also doesn\u2019t feel good is the apparent fact that Apple\u2019s marketing kinda left the Siri folks hanging out to dry. They started running ads promoting the features that would be available in the suped-up Siri last year, promising that it\u2019d arrive by June of this year. Those features were supposed to be part of the broader suite of Apple Intelligence offerings\u00e2\u0080\u0094one of the primary selling points of the iPhone 16, which otherwise didn\u2019t offer a whole lot of upgrades. But now those aren\u2019t coming. In fact, it seems there\u2019s no clear timeline for when they actually will arrive. Walker reportedly told the team that while Apple would like for their new intelligence features to roll out along with the launch of iOS 19, expected to be available this summer, it \u00e2\u0080\u009cdoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re shipping then.\u201d Currently, Bloomberg reports that the in-progress Siri feature only works the way it\u2019s supposed to between two-thirds to 80% of the time\u00e2\u0080\u0094which both sounds woefully insufficient and, if you have any experience with Siri, is about in line with how well it already works. While missing a deadline is painful and embarrassing, maybe the Siri team should take solace in the fact that most people probably aren\u2019t missing those promised features all that much. A December 2024 survey from trade journal SellCell found that 73% of iPhone owners found the company\u2019s new AI features to \u201cadd little to no value.\u201d That said, voice assistants like Siri kinda seem like a no-brainer application for artificial intelligence. It\u2019s surprising that it\u2019s taken so long for companies to get around to actually integrating it. Apple isn\u2019t alone in this problem. It took until last month for Amazon to announce AI-powered features for its Alexa voice assistant, and even those are getting slow-rolled as the company introduces them to a limited selection of devices for the time being. For all the hype AI generates, it seems like finding ways to get consumers to use it is harder than it may seem.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":" Stools often serve as unassuming supporting characters: practical pieces meant for brief moments of rest rather than extended comfort. Their straightforward purpose has traditionally led to equally straightforward designs, particularly in the flat-packed furniture market where simplicity reigns supreme. Yet within these constraints lies an opportunity for innovation that the Walle stool brilliantly seizes, transforming a basic seating solution into something far more functional. The genius of the Walle stool lies in its recognition of how we actually use these transitional seating spaces. Those moments when we pause to catch our breath or briefly observe our surroundings aren\u2019t merely empty times but are perfect opportunities for a few pages of reading. This thoughtfully designed metal stool accommodates this natural behavior by incorporating clever book storage directly into its structure, keeping 2 to 3 books within arm\u2019s reach whenever you need a literary escape during your short rest. Designer: Luis Gimeno       Engineering elegance defines the Walle\u2019s construction, with just four components that assemble with remarkable ease. The assembly requires only four screws, while the bottom shelf cleverly slots into place using notches in the opposing legs \u2013 no additional hardware needed. This approach not only simplifies assembly but allows the entire stool to be packaged in an exceptionally compact form, making it ideal for shipping, storage, and transport in our increasingly space-conscious world.        Visually, the Walle makes a subtle yet distinctive statement that draws inspiration from architectural forms. Its silhouette evokes the elegant simplicity of a miniature tower or traditional Torii gate, with seat and shelf edges that extend slightly beyond the frame. This intentional overhang creates visual interest through balanced asymmetry, demonstrating how thoughtful proportions can elevate even the most minimalist designs without requiring ornate detailing or excessive materials.   The stool\u2019s storage solutions are ingeniously integrated into its structural elements rather than added as afterthoughts. The side gutters accommodate slim reading materials like magazines or tablets, while the narrow space directly beneath the seat provides perfect housing for thicker books. Meanwhile, the bottom shelf offers versatile storage for additional reading material or personal items like bags and accessories, ensuring nothing needs to touch the floor.   The stool\u2019s metal construction offers durability that matches its timeless design approach. Unlike many contemporary furniture pieces that prioritize trends over longevity, the Walle\u2019s clean lines and practical functionality ensure it remains relevant regardless of shifting design fashions. What makes the Walle truly remarkable is how it transforms a typically single-purpose piece into a multifunctional design object without compromising its primary function or aesthetic integrity. It represents a perfect marriage of pragmatism and thoughtful design, acknowledging that even our briefest moments of rest can be enhanced through access to reading materials.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"ByMichael Foster  ByMichael Foster , Contributor.  Buy on the dip There are two things I need to bring to your attention right now, especially if you\u2019re an income investor. One is my outlook for the market, as volatility really hits home. The other is a 15.6%-yielding(!) fund that just changed its name and ticker\u2014and really grabbed contrarians\u2019 attention in the process. Let\u2019s start with what\u2019s really going on with this wild market. The NASDAQ is now down more than 10% from its peak price, and stocks on the whole are down for the year. I don\u2019t expect this to last very long. My take: 2025 is likely to be a year of volatility rather than a year of decline. Even so, the volatility we\u2019ve seen so far is relatively new. It was only the middle of last month that stocks started making a clear reversal from their long climb, and the NASDAQ 100 is still up 12.6% annualized over the last three years as I write this, while the S&P 500 is up an annualized 9.6%. Market Dip Just a quick look at this chart tells you that buying the dip during this period has been a winning strategy. It also tells us that both indices are setting up for another dip-buying opportunity, where stocks will fall to a point where they become irresistible. During volatile markets, however, the psychological pressures are tough, with sharp declines and trillions of dollars of wealth seemingly vanishing in a matter of days. This has always been a problem for markets, but I think it\u2019s less of a problem now, for one reason: COVID-19. This might sound a bit strange, so let me explain. At the start of the pandemic, trillions of dollars disappeared in hours. People were literally prohibited from economic activity, as they were forced to stay in their homes. Oil prices actually went negative. And yet stocks recovered, both because of monetary policy (the Fed swooped in with emergency rate cuts and massive buys of government bonds\u2014so-called \u201cquantitative easing\u201d) and, after that, technological progress (including changes in infrastructure responding to the pandemic, such as new supply chains; new medical technologies; and, of course, AI). In other words, investors have already seen the worst and it\u2019s fresh in their minds, so even if we face a recession over the next year or two, stocks are unlikely to collapse like they did in 2020 or 2008. So, in a sense, this time is different, but not in the way one might think: People are less likely to give in to total fear (or 2020-like despair!) as the business cycle weakens. Which means that while stocks are likely to fall, they\u2019re not likely to collapse. In such a situation, a smart play is to buy the dip slowly, steadily and strategically. Since fear is unpredictable, we can\u2019t wait for the market to bottom and swoop in to buy everything, but we can start buying when there\u2019s a correction, buy a little more as it worsens, and buy even more when it becomes a full-on bear market. And we can essentially double our \u201cdip-buying discount\u201d by purchasing stocks within a closed-end fund (CEF) trading at an attractive discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). That\u2019s where the BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX), payer of that outsized (to say the least) 15.6% dividend. BTX is the fund\u2019s newest ticker, which BlackRock changed from BIGZ last month. It also changed the name from the old monicker: the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust. As the name now says, the fund invests part of its portfolio in private equity, which can have bigger returns than public stocks in the long run, while the \u201cterm\u201d refers to the fact that the fund will come to maturity in 12 years. (Although there is fine print stating that the fund can convert to a perpetual fund, and I fully expect this to happen, so I don\u2019t pay much attention to the \u201cterm\u201d in the name here). The most important thing here (besides the huge dividend, of course) is the discount, which has been narrowing lately: BTX Discount Narrows Since the melodramatic fear-induced selloff of 2022, BTX\u2019s discount has narrowed as investors realized that a 20%-off sale on the fund\u2019s tech-stock holdings, including Marvell Technology (MRVL) and NVIDIA (NVDA), was a sweet deal. BlackRock, the fund\u2019s management firm, even realized this and started a stock-buyback program in early 2024. There\u2019s just one problem (or at least there was): BTX (under its former incarnation, BIGZ) lagged other BlackRock tech CEFs. But these days the fund is worth your attention. The changes to this fund run much deeper than a rebrand. BlackRock also made major revisions to its mandate, letting it invest even more in tech stocks. Now, at least 80% of its assets will be in public and private tech companies, instead of the previous focus on small- and mid-cap growth stocks. That mandate didn\u2019t work because small-cap stocks have underperformed other types of stocks for years, as you can see in the benchmark index fund for small caps, in blue below, compared to the NASDAQ (in orange) and the S&P 500 (in purple). Small Caps Lag This wasn\u2019t always the case, and the reason why small caps underperform more now than they used to is another article unto itself. In short, this was one of the reasons why I was wary of BTX when it was BIGZ. Ironically, BIGZ wasn\u2019t as \u201cbig-focused\u201d as it should have been. That has changed, along with BTX\u2019s fund managers, with the fund now being run by Tony Kim and Reid Menge. This is great news because Tony and Reid also manage the BlackRock Technology Opportunities Fund (BGSAX), which has run the table on the indices, including the NASDAQ, a particularly tough one to beat. This kind of outperformance deserves a premium, which BTX will likely get eventually. Until then, the fund remains attractive when it trades at a discount, as it is now.

(Selcuk Acar\/Anadolu via Getty Images)  Josh Hammer \/ @josh_hammer  Josh Hammer, a syndicated columnist, is senior editor-at-large at Newsweek and a research fellow with the Edmund Burke Foundation. He also is counsel and policy adviser for the Internet Accountability Project and contributing editor for Anchoring Truths. The stock market of late has been on a veritable roller coaster, Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency continues to ruffle feathers, Iran marches ever harrowingly closer to a nuclear weapon, and Russia and Ukraine get tantalizingly close to a ceasefire. But the national political conversation this week has curiously tended to focus not on any of that but instead on the uncertain fate of a lone noncitizen and former Columbia University graduate student, Mahmoud Khalil. Talk about a misplacement of priorities. Most American media consumers care a great deal about their pocketbooks and retirement accounts. They likely also care about stability on the world stage\u2013a subdued China, a relatively calm Middle East and a long-overdue peace deal to end the bloodshed in Eastern Europe. By contrast, here is one thing media consumers probably don\u2019t care a lot about: whether a Syrian national and Algerian citizen who was the face of last year\u2019s violent pro-Hamas Columbia University campus riots gets deported. You would never know that, of course, from the media\u2019s incessant focus on the Khalil saga. Is it any wonder that only 31% of Americans told Gallup last fall they have a \u201cgreat deal\u201d or \u201cfair amount\u201d of confidence in the media? In any event, Khalil is, by any metric, a wildly unsympathetic figure. The New York Times described him as the \u201cpublic face of protest against Israel\u201d at Columbia. He was the spokesman of a pro-Hamas student group called Columbia University Apartheid Divest. CUAD has referred to the Oct. 7 slaughter of Israelis as a \u201cmoral, military, and political victory\u201d and asserted that it is fighting for nothing less than the \u201ctotal eradication of Western civilization.\u201d Khalil personally distributed propaganda pamphlets titled \u201cOur Narrative\u2013Operation Al-Aqsa Flood,\u201d borrowing Hamas\u2019 code name for Oct. 7. Even more relevant, Khalil is not a U.S. citizen. He is a green card holder\u2013a legal alien. And like any alien, legal or illegal, he can only remain on our soil when the sovereign\u2013in the U.S., that\u2019s \u201cWe the People\u201d\u2013consents to it. And when we remove our consent, then the alien must go. The power to exclude is the singular defining feature of what it means to be a sovereign. Emer de Vattel\u2019s highly influential 1758 treatise, \u201cThe Law of Nations,\u201d described this power as plenary: \u201cThe sovereign may forbid the entrance of his territory either to foreigners in general, or in particular cases, or to certain persons, or for certain particular purposes, according as he may think it advantageous to the state.\u201d And as Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia noted in his 2001 dissent in Zadvydas v. Davis, quoting Justice Robert Jackson\u2019s earlier assertion in Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei (1953): \u201cDue process does not invest any alien with a right to enter the United States, nor confer on those admitted the right to remain against the national will.\u201d It\u2019s quite simple, really: Any alien, from someone here on a tourist visa to a green card holder, is here solely because We the People\u2013the citizens of this nation\u2013consented to it. When the alien violates the terms of their admission, they can be\u2013indeed, must be\u2013removed. That alien, moreover, can be removed summarily if so desired; there is no specific level of \u201cdue process\u201d to which an alien is entitled. That brings us back to Khalil\u2013a foreign national who violated the terms of his sojourn by supporting at least one (perhaps multiple) U.S. State Department-designated foreign terrorist organizations, and by making common cause with an organization clamoring more generally for \u201cthe total eradication of Western civilization.\u201d The day the United States loses the ability to deport noncitizens who espouse such toxic beliefs is the day the United States ceases to be a sovereign nation-state. And therein lies the entire point. The Khalil saga is where we see the intersection of the three menacing anti-Western ideologies I identify in my new book out this Tuesday, \u201cIsrael and Civilization: The Fate of the Jewish Nation and the Destiny of the West.\u201d First, there is the woke angle: Khalil and his ilk believe in the neo-Marxist \u201coppressor\u201d\/\u201coppressed\u201d dichotomy, and his view of Israel as an \u201coppressor\u201d underlies his repugnant activism. Second, there is the Islamist angle: Khalil supports Sunni Islamist outfits such as Hamas. Third, there is the global neoliberal angle: Those protesting Khalil\u2019s detention see little to no distinction between citizen and noncitizen\u2013like John Lennon\u2019s dystopian song \u201cImagine,\u201d they envision a borderless world. The drama over Khalil\u2019s arrest and detention is thus not really about Khalil. It is about the fate of the United States\u2013and the destiny of the very West of which the U.S. is the foundational cog. On Monday, the official X account for the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats posted, alongside a corresponding photo, \u201cFree Mahmoud Khalil.\u201d But if those Senate Democrats and Khalil\u2019s myriad other apologists are being honest, they seek not merely to \u201cfree\u201d Khalil from President Donald Trump\u2019s Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency. Rather, they seek to \u201cfree\u201d him\u2013and all of us\u2013from the shackles of Western civilization itself. COPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM We publish a variety of perspectives.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"It's expensive and kit-heavy, but I'm not going back. Early last year, the first widely available multi-gig broadband was announced for the UK market, offering download speeds up to 1.6Gbps over the Openreach FTTP network. As an irredeemable nerd who gets overexcited at the prospect of a download progress bar reaching heretofore unseen speeds, I knew that I had to try it out to see if it actually offered a noticeable improvement over the more readily available 900Mbps BT service I had before. Would there be a tangible benefit for gaming, content creation and downloading Linux ISOs?  To find out, I managed to get in touch with Zen Broadband, who amongst EE and Vodafone are one of the few UK providers offering this package. They offered a spot amongst their early access customers for \"Full Fibre Max\". The broadband was installed in early October, so I've now been using it for four months - and I've got to say, I'm a fan. That's despite the relatively high monthly cost (\u00a365) and the equipment I needed to pick up to truly make the most of a connection of this magnitude (router, switch, motherboard).  Before I get into the whys, hows and what-fors, it's probably sensible to address the elephant(s) in the room: yup, pretty much everyone can live with far more affordable broadband, even for 4K streaming or gaming, and of course, far faster broadband exists too - both abroad and right here in the UK, where residents of some lucky communities can get symmetric fibre connections up to 8Gbps (the mind boggles). However, as something that's in theory a bit more widely available, I think there's still value in looking at how this decidedly asymmetric 1.6Gbps\/ 0.11Gbps connection performs.  So: multi-gig broadband. To get this installed at a property that previously had FTTP connection up to 900Mbps, you'll need an Openreach engineer to upgrade the device that turns the fibre-optic cable that comes into your house into a regular ethernet cable that you can attach to your router. It's called an optical network terminal or ONT in the lingo, and most modern ONTs max out at gigabit speeds - pretty sensible. For faster connections, that's replaced with a 2.5-gig alternative, which in my experience is a relatively rapid procedure that requires an engineer visit but is otherwise painless.  Critically, the fibre line itself isn't changed, so there's no need to drill any fresh holes in the side of your building - just waiting for the engineer to unplug the existing ONT, plug in the new one and wait for it to be activated. For me, this took the better part of an hour from start to finish, with most of the time spent just waiting for the ONT to be remotely activated.  As I went with Zen as an ISP, I had a choice of two new routers: the Eero Pro 6E, which is included in the price of the broadband, or the Eero Max 7, which costs an extra \u00a310 a month. I went for the 6E, and that proved to be mistake - and it's the only thing I'd really ding Zen for in what was otherwise a seamless, deeply personalised and gentle swap from my previous providers BT.  Here's the thing: the Eero Pro 6E is a lovely bit of kit, providing fast and wide-ranging WiFi 6E - including that all-important 6GHz spectrum in addition to the usual 2.4GHz and 5GHz - but it doesn't allow you to access the full 1.6Gbps connection via ethernet. That's because the router only has two ethernet ports, a 2.5-gig port that must go to the ONT, and a one-gig port that can go to your PC, console, router or switch.  That feels like a massive failure for a router provided alongside a multi-gig connection, as the people that are spending this much on internet probably know the importance of a wired connection to maximise speeds and reliability. Sure, WiFi 6E can go beyond gigabit speeds, but it still felt galling to know I wasn't able to get the full-fat connection on my gaming PC!  Thankfully, Zen very nicely sent over the Pro 7 so I could compare the two devices, and the WiFi 7 option is definitely worth the extra \u00a3240 (\u00a310 x 24 months) given that it retails for \u00a3600 by itself. As well as boasting higher maximum wireless speeds, this router comes with what I would consider to be a suitable number of ethernet ports for multi-gig broadband: four, two of which are 10-gig, with the other two being 2.5-gig. That means you can use one of the 2.5-gig ports for your incoming internet, while keeping two 10-gig ports for extremely fast local transfers - eg for connecting a gaming\/work PC and a NAS.  Both Eero routers were quite novel to me in that they don't allow you to set them up using a web browser; instead you use an Android or iOS app. This simplifies certain things considerably - setup is particularly easy and rapid, and it's great having notifications when new devices join your network - but you do have fewer options than most traditional routers I've used over the years. Ultimately, I haven't ever needed to use those more advanced options, nor have I felt the need to install custom firmware, but it's worth knowing that the whole setup is much more firmly locked down than your average TP-Link, Asus or Netduma router. Of course, there are plenty of other WiFi 7 routers available that I haven't tested, so it's worth doing your own research on that front.  With my router situation solved and a stable 1.6Gbps download, 110Mbps upload and 7ms of ping registering on speed tests, it was time to work out what I would actually use this much bandwidth for. Sure, you can download an entire 845MB Nvidia graphics driver in four seconds, but you could have done that in about seven seconds on a 900Mbps connection, so what's the hurry?  The real differences come with substantially bigger downloads. The current Digital Foundry CPU benchmark suite accounts for just over 1.3TB, so the download time for that moves from around 3 hours and 15 minutes to an hour and 48 minutes. That's a critical speed-up when, for example, it's embargo day and you need to redo all of your tests on one CPU in your lineup, but the SSD you've been using now refuses to boot and you need to quickly reinstall everything on another drive... ask me how I know!  Beyond this, you really need multiple computers to reliably max out a multi-gig connection - and ideally, some roommates or family members that like to download their content rather than stream, as even 25mbps connections are capable of streaming 4K videos. Like the RTX 4090 effectively solves the issue of rasterised rendering, having broadband of this speed effectively solves multi-user streaming. You'd have to have a huge family unit to really notice any slowdowns at all, and in most cases you'll be hitting the limits of the servers you're downloading from rather than your connection.   While some routers like the Eero Max 7 have plenty of ethernet ports, others like the Eero Pro 6E do not - so often you'll want a second router or an unmanaged network switch to give multiple computers the ability to access the full potential of a multi-gig connection. It may not surprise you to learn that I have about a dozen computers in various states of repair in my office, so having a switch made the most sense to keep multiple computers connected at once without having to resort to WiFi - something that isn't included on all of our test systems.  D-Link were kind enough to send over their DMS-106XT, an unmanaged switch designed for gaming (we know this because it has an RGB light bar and a cool wedge-shaped metal design). It's genuinely the nicest-looking switch I've ever used, and of course like all unmanaged switches it works effectively without any need for configuration - just plug in your router or a NAS via the 10-gig link and five more devices via its 2.5-gig ports, and you're off to the races.  However, there are some extra features that are similarly set-and-forget. There's a turbo mode switch on the back which enables a port-based priority mode (ports one and six can effectively claim as much bandwidth as they want at the expense of other devices; port two gets second dibs and the remaining ports whatever scraps remain). There's also a button to toggle the RGB off if you want a more sedate look.  The switch has worked silently and reliably for months now, and at as low as \u00a3105 on sale it's quite reasonably priced for the 22.5 gigabytes of potential throughput you're getting.   I also experimented with using a few secondary routers to see if they were worth using instead of the Eero, though ultimately I decided against it. The Netgear XR1000 is a router that I've been using since 2022, providing some quite unique gaming features including a ping heatmap that blocks access to badly-performing or geographically distant game servers, ensuring your Counter-Strike matches will be lost by you and your teammates rather than because of network conditions. There's also a rather excellent implementation of QoS, a feature which prioritises gaming and other real-time traffic over downloads, preventing bufferbloat - where your connection to a game server goes all screwy when someone starts downloading something.  The Netduma R3 is an even more advanced version of the same idea, a device designed from the ground up to be a gaming router with some new capabilities like \"Hybrid VPN\" - essentially a way to easily connect multiple devices to an OpenVPN or WireGuard VPN, an ad blocker and \"Steady Ping\", which increases your ping to make it more stable - a bit like capping your game at a specific frame-rate. These are nice features that work as promised, and are easier to access than on the XR1000 with a modern-feeling UI.  However, the R3's hardware doesn't seem quite as fast or reliable as the XR1000 it ostensibly replaces, and I found its wireless signal strength and speeds were noticeably worse - likely as it's an AX3000 router versus the AX5400 of the XR1000. It also lacks USB functionality versus the XR1000, which could use it as a network share. Finally, it doesn't support PPPoE connections over a certain speed (500Mbps), making it a particularly poor choice for high-speed Openreach connections in the UK in particular. Of course, you can pair it with your ISP's router to get around this issue, but it is a pain if you want a single router solution, and with only gigabit ports you can't use the full potential of a multi-gig connection.  This Dongknows review is a little out of date now, but it reflects a lot of the experience I've had with the R3 - a good idea that hasn't quite delivered in practice. The router does continue to receive firmware updates, so it's worth trying if multiplayer gaming is particularly important to you. I hope that we eventually see an R4 model that combines WiFi 6E or 7 with some higher-end specs - it could be a great companion for a multi-gig connection in the future.   Thankfully, the Eero routers provided by Zen do have the most important thing for gaming - a decent QoS implementation, which is called \"Optimize for Conferencing and Gaming\" or \"SQM\". Enabling this reduced my bufferbloat to similar levels as with the Netduma R3, which is good enough for my purposes - though I do still miss some of the DumaOS ping geofencing features.  So - is multi-gig internet worth upgrading for? For me, the answer is yes. It's a great benefit to my actual job, it makes downloading Call of Duty patches as painless as possible, and it means that I never worry about guests or family members reducing my download speeds or interrupting a gaming session - there's more than enough bandwidth for everyone. I'd still kill for a symmetric connection with substantially more upstream bandwidth - those YouTube videos aren't going to upload themselves! - but for now, this is as good as it gets in the UK outside of relatively rare community fibre projects.  Would I recommend it to most people? No. I faced no hardships operating with the 900Mbps internet I was using before, and from a value perspective only the heaviest internet users should even consider gigabit speeds, let alone anything faster. If you're like me and also work in an online medium where fast speeds will make your life easier, then it's more justifiable but still a luxury purchase of a sort - especially as the high download speeds aren't accompanied by an increase in upload speeds over 900Mbps connections.  Beyond the not insignificant outlay on the internet connection itself, it's worth considering the cost of the various devices that you might feel compelled to pick up at some stage to make the most of your new speeds: new motherboards and laptops, fancy WiFi 7 routers and switches, high-end smartphones. Of these, the D-Link DMS-106XT switch is an easy recommendation to share a high-speed line between more wired devices, while the Eero Max 7 and Netduma R3 are both interesting routers worth at least knowing about.  Beyond testing this specific connection speed, I've also come away with a positive impression of both Zen, my new ISP, and Eero, my new router system. Zen's customer support has been so much more engaging, responsive and real versus the giants of BT and Virgin that I've used previously, and I'd recommend them to anyone in the UK. For multi-gig in particular, I think offering the Eero Pro 6E is a bit weird, and they ought to swap to the Eero Pro 7 and its two 2.5-gig ports instead once this is available later in February.  Amazon's Eero routers are also a bit of a revelation - I don't particularly like giving up the control to really fiddle with firmwares and so on, but the features that are here work well and the process of monitoring devices or adding new routers is exceptionally streamlined. There are certainly more affordable WiFi 6E \/ 7 devices out there, but for ease-of-use these routers deserve their reputation.   I think that's just about everything, so I'll just conclude by saying that I look forward to reading your comments on multi-gig internet below. If you have any questions about the whole situation, I'll answer them if I can.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":" The design of handheld gaming devices is finally starting to diversify a bit. Although originally inspired by the success of the Nintendo Switch, most followed the unibody design of the Steam Deck. Given the complexity of having removable controllers paired with the complexity of computers themselves, it\u2019s understandable that not many manufacturers dared to take the risk in such a niche and still unproven market. That\u2019s not to say there haven\u2019t been attempts, like the first Lenovo Legion GO, for example, but they\u2019re few and far between. Recently, we\u2019ve been seeing some rather curious interpretations of that design, including one with a gigantic 10-inch screen. That\u2019s what this peculiar handheld gaming PC design obviously tries to pull off but it seems to make a mistake in the one part that matters the most. Designer: CRELANDER        When it comes to gaming computers, there are many elements that determine their success or failure, but handheld devices boil that down to two important things: the form factor and raw power. After all, it has to be comfortable to hold to even be considered a \u201chandheld\u201d device, and it has to have enough processing power to handle gaming. The CRELANDER \u201claptop\u201d teeters on the former but seems to completely flop the latter.        Technically speaking, you could consider the CRELANDER as more of a tablet than either a laptop or a handheld PC. Its 10.5-inch touch screen pretty much makes sure of that, but its rather thick 20mm body takes it out of the competition in the slim and sleek department. What earmarks it for gaming, however, are the detachable controllers that seem to physically connect to the sides of the tablet, exactly like the Nintendo Switch Joy-cons. With a weight of at least 2.2 lbs (1kg), however, it\u2019s probably not going to be a comfortable gaming session while you\u2019re standing up.   Its biggest flaw, however, is the Intel N95 that drives the whole thing, a low-power processor that won\u2019t be able to handle any AAA or graphics-intensive games. The rest of the specs, which includes 16GB or 32GB of RAM and up to 2TB SSD definitely fit the bill of a gaming PC, but the processor will be the bottleneck that ruins the experience. Not unless all you want to do is play retro or emulated games, as well as a few casual PC games, then this multi-purpose portable PC might look attractive.  It\u2019s highly likely that the $350 price tag is the driving factor behind the choice of an Intel N95, though it\u2019s a sacrifice that asks too much even for that price. There are some, like the OneXPlayer X1, that make the same proposition with better design and specs though at three times the cost. Given these factors, you might start to ask whether such a novel design on a large 10-inch tablet is worth it at all.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"As I\u2019m getting older I look back on all the things I\u2019ve done as a creative developer, and I see so many cool projects! But I never wrote down any development stories, and most of these projects, even as successful when released, got lost in time as years go by. That\u2019s why I\u2019m starting my new posts series \u201eThat time I\u201d where I look back on my most interesting projects. The first one is about that time I recreated Photoshop in C++ and Windows API! I invite you to read my story and leave a comment with feedback, it\u2019s hard to go on without your input \ud83d\ude42 Everything started in early summer of 2006. I was reading *a lot* of manga back then. But all the image reading apps sucked. Specifically, none of the apps allowed me to control my reading using just the mouse, and reaching my keyboard all the time was distracting. Since I just finished the C++\/Windows API course at the uni, I spent the summer break coding my perfect manga reader. And I named it Fiew. Early autumn 2006 we returned to uni and had to decide on our final thesis for the degree. Writing the image viewer went smooth enough that I got the idea I could create an image editor as well. I was a heavy Adobe Photoshop user back then, so that became my goal. I mean, how hard can it be? Turns out, very. Over the course of the next several months, I wrote Advanced Image Editor named Fedit in C++ using Windows API and GDI+ graphic libraries. It followed a set of five rules to benefit the end user: no installers, no archives, no registry keys, no additional runtimes and a single executable file. The result was a program that was ready to work without the need of installation, could be run on systems with limited privileges (or straight from a thumb drive) and consumed small amounts of resources. I was very careful to make the interface look like classic Photoshop, and include all my most used features. So you had all the free floating windows with tools. The excellent colour picker. Easy layer management. Step-by-step reversible history. Several image filters, plus a matrix interface to encode your own pixel shifting filters too. Straight from my previous project named Fiew I added a massive image library viewer. It really could quickly and easily scroll through massive amounts of pictures. I had a lot of fun coding Fedit. And a lot of issues along the way. I spent a ton of time on MSDN and Experts Exchange (old web Stack Overflow), however that didn\u2019t help that much since most of the issues were so specific I had to analyse and debug them on my own. But I worked like crazy on it, my motivation was immense. I had to make the bachelor thesis deadline, so for the final two-month stint I worked 14 hours a day. User interface was the most tricky bit. I wanted the workflow to resemble Photoshop as much as possible. The freely snapping-unsnapping of the tool settings pane was particularly hard. But no less than recreating the colour picker or the tool selector. By the time I finished I was pretty exhausted and kind of resenting WinAPI. But the thesis was a success and I received my Bachelor of Science in Engineering from the Warsaw University of Technology. Fedit received several positive reviews online but I didn\u2019t promote it. Instead I took a well deserved holiday. A few months later thanks to the impression Fiew and Fedit made on the CTO of GoldenLine (Polish LinkedIn, market leader in its time, but now defunct), I landed a C++ job with a task to create extremely efficient WinAPI app to handle massive image uploading for a clone of Flickr. So in the end all that effort paid off. Fedit (and Fiew) source code is available on GitHub. The thesis documentation is available as PDF. The original website for these apps is still up on the Web Archive!

I need this type of motivation. How can one be so much motivated for such long period of time. Also, with the wave of AI and very less jobs, what is your advice to someone who wants to break into tech and or get a job at a big tech. A roadmap, step by step process or something? Thanks! Fun is the best motivation. You need to have fun building, watching it appear and work as expected. It\u2019s like building with legos. At first there is nothing much, then with every step you see more of it, and at the end it\u2019s amazing. And you have fun in the process. It\u2019s hard to say how to break into IT these days, with AI etc. We are witnessing a great shift. It\u2019s a challenge for the old way of thinking about IT jobs, but also an opportunity if you don\u2019t follow the usual path. You need to adapt quickly, and take leaps of faith. Best bet probably is to become an expert in managing AIs. Also want to mention one thing, the hardest part for me was doing the \u201cbrush\u201d. Because I wasn\u2019t doing \u201cstamp\u201ding like photoshop, I think photoshop doing some \u201cstamp\u201ding in order to create different brushes. I used lines, so when mouse moves it was just creating short lines if that does make any sense. and it was soooo slow. Like whenever mouse moves it was just look at image and just changes it, but this is not good. So I was using 700\u00d79000 webtoon to see how things working and it was around 150~ fps. Most people would say that\u2019s fine, but it wasn\u2019t imo. I knew that I could do much faster. So I thought just changing the parts where mouse is around, can\u2019t explain too well but I somehow think you would understand me \ud83d\ude00 So after trying lots of things, like photoshop \u201cspacing\u201d (tho I don\u2019t like spacing thing in photoshop, the first thing I do is changing that from 25% to 4% whenever I install this program). In the end I could manage to get 1k~ish fps. https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/nPjki1C This is the image. Just wanted to share this, because I don\u2019t see anyone else doing photoshop clone other than me and you \ud83d\ude00  I\u2019m hella impressed by the things u did in 2006 wow, thank you for sharing this. It made me so happy to see, had to write a comment again \ud83d\ude00 That was one of my bigger challenges as well! In fact there is a small rendering bug when painting in my app, if I remember correctly. However, there is a whole section in my thesis about optimising for real time painting performance. I think I am re-rendering only the square area the size of the currently selected brush. Additionally I remember WinAPI mouse position polling was sometimes sparse when the cursor was moving fast so I think there was some approximation involved to smooth the drawing line. I never thought about it in terms of FPS, very interesting! This is awesome, you\u2019re a brave one. After spending some time with the WASAPI last weekend I wouldn\u2019t wish the hell that is interface upon anyone. FYI your comment box submit button is out of view on Firefox. I was fascinated by C++ back then, and the powers WinAPI gave a developer. It was so bare bone and direct to Windows. I thought I could do anything. It was basically true, but very very hard work. Thanks for the note on the comment box, I just fixed it by turning off Jetpack enhancements. Yoooo! THAT\u2019S TOO COOL! I\u2019m a student from Turkey and I did Photoshop in PyQt for my bachelor\u2019s degree this year!! Daamn, and it has specific functionalities for manga editing! The reason I tried this also because was manga. It\u2019s crazy to see a person who is doing the similiar stuff in 20 years ago. Btw can\u2019t comment because of \u201cThis site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Learn how your comment data is processed.\u201d thing. Or maybe because of \u201cscroll\u201d thing not appearing. Btw for me, the hardest part was like the brush thing. And I actually didn\u2019t implement brushes as ps does. Since I have to show the brush on every mouse move, it\u2019s kinda too much consuming. So I had to think a lot on this one, I did something like a \u201cpolling\u201d system, kinda like the photoshop \u201cspacing\u201d. When I first wrote my code, it had almost 150~ fps on 700\u00d79000 image. It was doing lines not stamping if the words makes sense. My biggest mistake was refreshing the image whenever the mouse moves so it was okay  in 1920\u00d71080 images. And 150~fps doesn\u2019t sound too bad actually. But you know, I knew that I could do better, so I wanted to make it much faster. And I DID actually. This image https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/nPjki1C shows the difference. It was hard to do, but after I accomplish this it was soo good to see. It makes you so happy, I think you know what I mean \ud83d\ude00 Hello from Poland!

The fine art of social media management means being able to respond quickly to events, and Promeo\u2019s template- and AI-based workflow, along with easy access to stock images and video, takes a lot of the time-consuming work out of creating posts for Instagram, Facebook, and more.  Why you can trust Creative Bloq     Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.  Promeo comes from Cyberlink, the company behind the Director apps for photo and video editing. The firm\u2019s products have been on a bit of an AI kick recently, with the ability to create AI music added to PowerDirector 365, and image generation incorporated into PhotoDirector 365. With Promeo, the idea is to let the algorithms do a lot of the heavy lifting for you, with the ability to create social media posts and even adverts with a few clicks. Or taps, as Promeo is also available as an iOS and Android app, though we\u2019re reviewing the Windows version here. So alongside the kind of tools you might get in Canva, here you begin a project with a template and build upon it - though a blank sheet of paper is available too. You get a wealth of stickers, stock images and text effects, but the AI smarts help set Promeo apart. Apart enough to put it among the best AI photo editor apps or best graphic design software out there? We'll see.  Promeo is a free download, and comes with a monthly or annual subscription of $40. You can also get it as a bundle with Cyberlink\u2019s Director Suite 365, though this costs much more. You\u2019ll need to make an account, but after signup it largely stays out of your way. Projects can be started from blank sheets or templates, and there are starting points available for stills and images on social networks and online stores, basic print products such as flyers, or simple white rectangles, though it doesn\u2019t offer paper sizes such as A5. From here, you can choose to put together a project yourself, or let the AI handle it. Pick the latter, and you\u2019ll be prompted to upload a source image for the AI to build the post around, or let it generate one from text prompts, which you\u2019ll have to enter to tell it what kind of post you\u2019re trying to create. After this, you\u2019ll be presented with a selection of options the AI has put together from your prompts. Choose one, and you can edit it further. It\u2019s a fast way to create a post in a hurry, and has the added benefit that, after generating 25 or so alternative ideas, one or two might be usable.  Alongside all this template-based creation, Cyberlink has added AI-based image extraction. This works like its Adobe equivalent to identify the subject of an image and remove the background, and you\u2019re given the choice of plain white or transparency here so that you can use it as a background image or an overlay, and there's a batch edit function that allows you to queue up images to be processed while you do something else. There's also the option to replace the background with a newly generated one. The app works through a layer system that will be familiar to users of many other image editing or layout apps, with each one helpfully outlined when you hover your mouse over it for easy identification.  An interesting feature is the ability to build your own brand kit by adding folders of images and other graphics from your PC, so you can easily integrate them into your creations, and you can add frequently used objects to a library too, so you can find them more easily. If you need images, Promeo has a sidebar option dedicated to pulling images out of the Getty\/iStock stock images and video libraries, which appear in your compositions without a watermark (and there's royalty-free music too, for video ambience). These files are downloaded into a cache, as are any template files you make use of, and you can limit the size of this cache in the app\u2019s settings to prevent it from taking over an SSD. Promeo can also AI-generate new images if nothing suitable can be found, and of course, you can import your own images, video and music if you have it. Text is handled by a simple system with plenty of options, such as changing the text direction or adding animation as well as making letters bold or italic. There's AI here too, with a Co-writer available to punch up your copy in varying tones of voice, as well as summarise or expand upon what you\u2019ve written. It\u2019s all fairly standard AI stuff, but nicely integrated into the app and easy to access. There are also stickers that can be slapped across your post for a simple attention-getter.  The app maintains a clean look and feel in use, with a minimum of floating palettes and sidebars. Typically, there is one at the left for holding stock images, overlays, stickers and more, while your project\u2019s layers are found on the right. At the bottom, there's a timeline that comes into play if you\u2019re working with video or animation, but otherwise, the interface does its best to foreground your work and stay out of the way. Clicking on a project component brings up a small floating toolbar from which you can edit, delete or save it, with a drop-down menu adding more options. When it comes to exporting your creations, the app\u2019s social media creation roots show themselves. Still images can only be saved as a JPEG or PNG, and you don\u2019t even get a choice over how video is exported, with an MP4 file appearing in the export folder. These are ideal for immediate sharing, of course, but do limit the app as a content creation solution for things that can be imported into other apps. Promeo is speedy in use, even when using its AI functions on a PC using an integrated GPU, probably because its web focus means it can operate at fairly low resolutions, though it\u2019s not clear from the app whether it\u2019s using on-device processing or offloading the work to the cloud. The first AI-generated option can take some time to appear, but once that\u2019s done the others follow quite quickly. As you\u2019d expect from AI-generated images, there can be some quite uncanny results - some pine trees it created for us in response to a prompt didn\u2019t look quite right, and its idea of an autumnal adventure included aeroplanes with strangely wonky, truncated wings that had apparently landed vertically among high-rise buildings that looked like they\u2019d melted. It can also be rather American, making it important to specify UK English in your prompts if that\u2019s important to you.  As a subscription product available from $9.99 per month, depending on your plan, this is an app you can dip in and out of as and when it\u2019s useful to you, but the cost for a full year\u2019s subscription is lower than that of 12 individual months. The best thing about it may be the inclusion of non-watermarked stock images, something worth paying for if you regularly use them for social media posts. It\u2019s not especially expensive, and if you\u2019re in the business of creating lots of posts and social media ads quickly, could save a significant amount of time. Anyone who regularly creates posts for social media and relies on stock images will get a lot of use out of this app. For print products such as flyers and posters, even though they\u2019re supported, it might be less useful than something like Canva, but its ability to remove backgrounds from images and bring together disparate AI writing and image editing tools into one interface will still be valuable. You\u2019re looking for a fast, streamlined way to generate multiple ideas for social media posts and shopping site ads, want to create from templates rather than scratch every time, and like the idea of using AI tools and stock images to assemble projects. You\u2019d rather come at a project from a more traditional angle. While Promeo can utilise any bespoke graphics you have, you\u2019re paying for an AI system and stock image access you might not use, so perhaps another graphics app would be better. out of 10 The fine art of social media management means being able to respond quickly to events, and Promeo\u2019s template- and AI-based workflow, along with easy access to stock images and video, takes a lot of the time-consuming work out of creating posts for Instagram, Facebook, and more.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"Business Insider Edition  China looks investible again.          The country's stocks are rallying, countering the notion that investors should avoid the world's second-biggest economy.               Though many on Wall Street have been bearish on China since 2023, its stock market is suddenly looking good relative to flagging US peers.               Just a year ago, investors fled China in droves as they lost faith in its post-pandemic economy, and the exodus quickly back an ongoing problem for Beijing.                Amid fear that China would buckle from deflation, unemployment, or its high debt environment, foreign direct investment last year hit its lowest level since 1992.               The CSI 300 Index, a benchmark of mainland shares, dropped over 45% from a 2021 peak to the end of last year.               But now, while US stock leaders have suffered big declines since mid-February, Chinese large-caps have achieved their best annual start since 2002.               While the Samp;P 500 is down almost 10% from its February all-time high, the CSI 300 has topped a mid-December high and is up about 5% year-to-date.               The moves are causing analysts to start paying attention.               Citi recently upgraded China stocks to \"Overweight,\" while dropping its view of US stocks to \"Neutral.\" Meanwhile, Bank of America has said that the country will outperform this year, predicting that the previously \"unloved\" tech stocks will gain ground on sagging US peers.               Before this year, many were skeptical about China's tech environment, which was weighed down by disapproval from Beijing officials. Since 2020, many of the nation's leading tech names have been caught in a\u00a0regulatory \"crackdown,\" making investors hesitant to put money to work.               But the government's changing approach toward the industry has been on full display in the past month, starting with President Xi Jinping's supportive remarks at a top tech symposium in February.               Pro-business undertones continued in this week's \"two sessions,\" a set of concurrent policy meetings that outline the country's economic goals.               Ben Harburg, founder of Core Values Alpha, cited Beijing's recent embrace of its tech sector as one of several catalysts behind his firm's upside thesis.               Eighteen months ago, his company created the CoreValues Alpha Greater China Growth ETF on the idea that investors have become too pessimistic about China's economy and its tech sector.               \"[Beijing] very clearly said: 'Our national growth will be driven by technology,'\" Harburg told Business Insider. \"So it is unequivocal now they will lean in on technology, they will be supportive of technology, will do everything in their power to stimulate, subsidize, de-regulate \u2014 whatever is necessary to help technology kind of win.\"               That's an alluring notion for stocks beaten down by an anti-tech narrative in recent years. As of late February, Chinese equities were trading at around a 50% discount compared to the US market.               But the perceptions of China's negative view of the space might have been exagerrated, Harburg noted.               \"I don't think the Chinese government was ever an anti-tech as we were led to believe,\" he said, adding: \"The world perceives it very differently, because [regulation] happens without any warning, and it and it kind of like just shocks people and throws them off.\"               The crackdown narrative has given Chinese equities room to run higher this year, as it's helped lower valuations which are now moving upward. But it also helped catch US investors by surprise.                 Starting with China's DeepSeek tool, a flurry of competitive Chinese AI tools have debuted this year, upending confidence in America's leadership in the space and sparking a reevaluation of Beijing's market, Harburg said.               As the AI trade has waned in the US this year, China's AI-linked stocks have soared on the back of the latest announcements.                \"Clearly, China is much further along than we were told,\" Harburg said.               There are still challenges though, and, so far, Beijing's focus on tech is only a sentiment shift, said Tianlei Huang, a researcher for the Peterson Institute for International Economics.               While positive signals were given, this remains a symbolic gesture without new policies. China's private sector\u2014including tech\u2014 continues to face the same challenges that have pushed investors away since COVID, while confidence among entrepreneurs and consumers is at post-pandemic lows               \"The reaction in the stock market to this [tech] symposium is, I think, actually a very sad thing,\" he said. \"Nothing in substance has really changed in terms of policy, regulations, right? It's just an attitude change.\"               Many of the broader issues that have plagued China's economy are still in play. That includes a highly indebted real-estate sector and downbeat consumers, creating a deflationary environment from which investors have fled since 2023.               But Beijing might finally be waking up to this as well.               Over the past year, many of its stimulus measures have fallen short as they failed to target domestic consumers, which analysts agree are the linchpin to growth. Yet, during the two sessions, there was a new-found emphasis on domestic demand and private consumption.               By Friday, stocks rose as the government urged financial lenders to ease loan terms for consumer borrowers.               The shift toward domestic growth comes as China realizes it cannot reach this year's 5% GDP target by depending on trade, Huang said.                This was the case last year, as net exports accounted for 30% of GDP. It's not a sustainable number, and it's largely driven by product stockpiling from buyers worried about Washington's trade war.               It remains to be seen whether the 5% target is realistic, Huang said, though the sentiment shift is significant and should shape future policy.               But Harburg sees things in a much brighter light. Aside from the positive mood in tech, he noted that investor fears about China haven not been realized. There's been no major real-estate crash and improvements are beginning to show in first-tier cities.               \"It doesn't happen for two years, three years, four years. And so the reality is, I think people are finally kind of fatigued with all of these stories that they were told,\" he said.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"Sign up for your daily dose of dope. Elon Musk raged against Democrats again as Tesla falls apart. Contact us by Email March 14 2025, Published 8:00 p.m. ET Elon Musk is not very happy these days as he has now blamed Democrats for his company Tesla having a historic downfall on the stock market. The controversial billionaire reminded his followers why he stopped voting for Democrats, claiming they are the party of \"hate\" and they tried to take out Donald Trump, RadarOnline.com can reveal.  Musk lost it again on X, calling out Democrats for being the party of 'hate' The 53-year-old took to his own platform X to respond after one loyal fan reacted to Musk's tweet from 2022. At the time, Musk wrote: \"In the past, I voted Democrat, because they were (mostly) the kindness party. But they have become the party of division and hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican.\" \"Now, watch their dirty tricks campaign against me unfold.\" Musk has been ripped for weeks, with his company Tesla taking a hit, too. The user claimed Musk's prediction was \"proven right,\" as he wrote: \"Death threats, Tesla stores shot up, Superchargers firebombed, cyber attacks on X and conservative X users swatted.\" Always one for attention, on March 14, Musk responded and said: \"It was easy to predict. This is their standard playbook.  \"Look at what they did to President Trump. He was loved by democrats until he ran for president.\"  \"Now they call him Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, etc and try to kill him,\" Musk added, referring to the assassination attempt on Trump in Meridian, Pennsylvania, in July 2024. All this comes as Musk's automotive and clean energy company Tesla has taken a brutal hit in the stock market. According to Business Insider, from December to Wednesday of this week after trading hours, Tesla lost almost 50 percent of its market cap. The company saw its peak value of $1.54trillion from the end of 2024 fall to about $777billion. \"We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,\" JPMorgan analysts told the outlet. Trump has stood by Musk's side, even labeling those who protest Tesla 'domestic terrorists.' Tesla continues to see a global decline in sales, largely due to Musk's political views. Meanwhile, plenty of Tesla showrooms in the United States have been hit with protests and vandalism incidents.  The president even said he would consider branding the perpetrators domestic terrorists. Meanwhile, Musk previously claimed he was being \"silenced\" on X, after the platform underwent what the businessman labeled as a \"cyberattack.\" However, even politicians are getting in on the act against Musk, as Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) said Friday he plans to boot his Tesla car, calling out \"a--hole\" Musk. The senator said on X: \u201cWhen I bought this thing, I didn\u2019t think it was going to become a political issue. Every time I get in this car in the last 60 days or so, it reminds me of just how much damage Elon Musk and Donald Trump is doing to our country.\u201d He continued: \"Talking about slashing Social Security, cutting health care benefits for poor people, for seniors.\" \"It\u2019s one bad thing after the next. He\u2019s firing veterans. I\u2019m a veteran,\" Kelly added.

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"ByZak Doffman  ByZak Doffman , Contributor.  New scam alert issued by FBI Anadolu Agency via Getty Images Update: Republished on March 18 with examples of the dangerous websites behind this latest FBI warning and additional advice on staying safe.  Following hot on the heels of the FBI\u2019s warning for Americans to delete fraudulent texts as a malicious scam sweeps across America, here comes another alert as a very different kind of threat has emerged. The latest scam targets both smartphone and desktop users through websites crafted to steal your passwords, financial information and wallets. This time it\u2019s utility websites in the bureau\u2019s crosshairs, as it \u201cincreasingly sees a scam involving free online document converter tools.\u201d These are the simplest, most innocuous websites, but criminals are using \u201cconverter tools to load malware onto victims\u2019 computers, leading to incidents such as ransomware.\u201d \u201cThe best way to thwart these fraudsters is to educate people so they don\u2019t fall victim to these fraudsters in the first place,\u201d the FBI says in an online warning via its Denver field office. \u201cIf you or someone you know has been affected by this scheme, we encourage you to make a report and take actions to protect your assets. Every day, we are working to hold these scammers accountable and provide victims with the resources they need.\u201d Kaspersky warns that \u201conline converters are a tempting but dangerous way to change file format\u2026 Because converting a file is not simply a matter of changing its extension \u2014 otherwise you could just rename the file from, say, EPUB to MP3. Instead, the converter program must read the file, understand what it contains, convert the data and re-save it in a different format \u2014 and each of these stages poses its own threats.\u201d It\u2019s not just websites; there are a raft of dangerous conversion tools on smartphone app stores as well. But unlike the official Google and Apple stores, there are no defenses preventing criminals publishing malicious websites. You\u2019re reliant on the security tools built into your browser and common sense. \u201cUnfortunately, many victims don\u2019t realize they have been infected by malware until it\u2019s too late, and their computer is infected with ransomware or their identity has been stolen.\u201d The FBI\u2019s advice as ever is to \u201ctake a breath, slow down and think. Be aware of your actions online and what risks you could be exposed to.\u201d In addition, PC users should ensure they have some form of updated antivirus software running on their machines. You will also benefit by enabling safe browsing if available on your browser. Chrome and Safari dominate the mobile browsing market, and with Edge do the same across desktops. Whether using those or other browsers on your phone or desktop, if you think you might have fallen for a such a scam, you can report it at IC3.gov, and more critically you should change your passwords and check your online accounts. This is just the latest warning for web and app users to avoid utility tools that are simple for an attacker to create and which will always find a ready audience. If you need to convert documents, use a tool from an established provider or the stock ones available with your OS or other platforms. You certainly should not send any files to the cloud for conversion, provide personal information or install software. Kaspersky says \u201cthe safest way is to convert files locally; that is, on your own device without using third-party sites. This way, the data is guaranteed to remain confidential \u2014 at least until you connect to the internet. You can change a file\u2019s format using either system tools or popular programs.\u201d And this isn\u2019t the only online document warning doing the rounds. Per Bleeping Computer over the weekend, \u201ccybercriminals are promoting malicious Microsoft OAuth apps that masquerade as Adobe and DocuSign apps to deliver malware and steal Microsoft 365 accounts credentials.\u201d These are \u201cmalicious OAuth apps\u201d that are \u201cimpersonating Adobe Drive, Adobe Drive X, Adobe Acrobat, and DocuSign.\u201d This warning comes courtesy of the research team at Proofpoint, and highlights the risks with online services that easily lure users into clicking links. While a URL in an email might raise concerns, we are all now used to receiving DocuSign or Adobe links that we click through. It has proven too easy for criminals to add brand impersonation into the mix, and when an attack is highly targeted, this becomes difficult to spot. While this latest campaign impersonated \u201ccharities or small companies using compromised email accounts,\u201d last year government agencies themselves were being mimicked. SlashNext warned of a \u201cconcerning turn,\u201d as \u201cbusinesses that regularly interact with state, municipal, and licensing authorities\u201d were targeted. This came as a 98% increase in the use of DocuSign phishing URLs was flagged. \u201cCybercriminals offer any kind of popular file conversion to attract victims,\u201d Malwarebytes says in a new report following the FBI\u2019s warning, \u201cwith the most common ones converting .doc to .pdf files and vice versa. There are also sites that offer to combine multiple images into one .pdf file.\u201d And the functionality is so simple that \u201cit\u2019s not as if these file converters don\u2019t work.

According to Malwarebytes, telltale warning signs include pushing you to download a conversion tool or browser extension, or \u201cin the most sophisticated scenario, the so-called converted file contains malware code that downloads and install an information stealer and everyone who opens it will get their device infected.\u201d The security team has provided some of the website domains it has found in the wild pushing these kinds of attacks: Coming full circle, the FBI has also warned this month that scammers are even impersonating federal agencies, as citizens are presented \u201cwith a fraudulent federal warrant and asked to pay fines to clear it up.\u201d Be careful out there.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-15","content":"ByGarth Friesen  ByGarth Friesen , Contributor.  Photographer: Milan Jaros\/Bloomberg Gold prices have climbed 13.6% in 2025 and breached $3,000 per ounce last week, setting a new all-time high. Geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty are driving safe-haven flows, pushing up gold prices. However, several other longer-term factors and trends will help determine whether the rally will be sustained. The biggest shift in the gold market in recent years is increased demand from global central banks. According to the World Gold Council, central banks purchased over 1,000 metric tons of gold in 2024, marking the third consecutive year of significant buying and approximately double the average annual purchase amount for the prior decade. Central bank reserve buying has continued in 2025, led by Uzbekistan, China, Kazakhstan, Poland, and India. Central banks started to increase their allocation to gold following the seizure of Russia\u2019s central bank assets in 2022 following the invasion of Ukraine. Western nations' freezing of $300 billion in Russian central bank fiat currency assets exposed the vulnerability of holding reserves in foreign currencies or overseas institutions. Russian central bank gold assets were not seized because they were held inside Russia. This event launched a global drive for diversification, with gold emerging as a preferred asset due to its independence from political and economic sanctions. In addition to reducing the risk of seizure, central banks view gold as a hedge against inflation and a way to reduce reliance on dollar-heavy reserves. Given the Trump administration\u2019s less-friendly approach to foreign relations, central bank de-dollarization via increasing allocations to gold is likely to continue. Geopolitical and economic tensions are affecting more than central banks\u2019 gold appetite. They are also impacting investor behavior. Rising global debt levels, renewed fears of recession, escalating tariffs on trade, and a global monetary easing cycle have pushed investors toward gold as a hedge. Global gold ETF inflows have accelerated significantly so far in 2025. According the World Gold Council, physically backed gold ETFs took in $9.4 billion in February, the largest monthly inflow since March 2022. The largest U.S. gold ETF, iShares GLD, now has $86.6 billion in assets, up from $73.2 billion at the end of 2024. The inflows helped propel GLD 13.6% higher in 2025 and 37.8% over the last year. GLD Assets Institutional investors also believe the gold rally can continue. In his market and macro outlook recorded on March 11, DoubleLine CEO Jeffrey Gundlach said, \"I think gold will make it to $4,000. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019ll happen this year, but I feel like that\u2019s the measured move anticipated by the long consolidation at around $1,800 on gold.\" In addition, Goldman Sachs recently revised its gold forecast higher to $3,100 a troy ounce by the end of 2025. The enthusiasm for gold has spilled over to gold miner stocks. VanEck\u2019s GDX, the largest gold miner ETF, has jumped 28.8% year-to-date, significantly outperforming the S&P 500, which has lost 4%. GDX, which includes mining giants Newmont and Agnico Eagle Mines as its two largest holdings, has climbed 52.5% over the last year. Miners are leveraged to the price of gold, and rising spot prices are expected to generate significant revenue and profit growth for the sector this year. YTD performance of GDX, GLD and SPY Gold demand could also be boosted by new entrants into the market. For example, China recently launched a pilot program allowing ten major insurance companies to invest up to 1% of their assets in gold for the first time. The program, announced by the National Financial Regulatory Administration on February 7, 2025, could add $27 billion to demand and help support gold prices. New sources of demand and continued geopolitical stress could trigger additional flows into gold over the next few quarters. However, despite the upward momentum, there are some reasons to be cautious about the continuation of the trend. An improvement in the global economic outlook, possibly stemming from a resolution in the tariff dispute, could diminish gold\u2019s appeal as a safe-haven asset. If trade tensions ease and growth metrics strengthen, investors may rotate away from defensive assets such as gold and back into growth equities. Additionally, with inflation concerns beginning to resurface due to higher potential import prices in the U.S., the Federal Reserve may not be able to deliver on the three 0.25% cuts currently priced into the Fed funds market. Higher interest rates for longer would increase the opportunity cost of holding gold. Jewelry demand, which constitutes about 40% of global gold consumption, may decline due to record-high prices. India, the world\u2019s second-largest country in gold jewelry demand, is going through a temporary soft patch in economic growth. Any significant decline in buying from Indian consumers could signal weakening fundamentals, potentially offsetting demand from investors and central banks. Global gold demand Increasing gold allocations over the last year has clearly worked out well for investors. Central bank demand is unlikely to fade in the current environment, and momentum traders could chase the market above $3,000 per ounce. However, at least some of the recent rise is attributable to safe-haven flows, which may be temporary. If the Trump administration is correct in its forecast for an improved economic outlook in the second half of 2025, the current pressures on growth could abate, triggering a reversal of sentiment in the gold market. Until then, the trend is your friend, and the trend is still intact.","label":0}

Sources include:  TheGuardian.com 1  TheGuardian.com 2  Brighteon.com   The boycott against Tesla has gained momentum in recent months, fueled by growing concerns over Musk's influence in the federal government and his controversial Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative.\r DOGE, which Musk has touted as a cost-saving measure, has been criticized for its lack of transparency, false claims about canceled contracts and minimal evidence of actual savings. Critics argue that Musk's involvement in federal affairs has created conflicts of interest and undermined public trust.\r Tesla's stock decline on March 10 was also attributed to broader market fears of a potential recession and Trump's proposed tariff plans, which could impact the auto industry.
