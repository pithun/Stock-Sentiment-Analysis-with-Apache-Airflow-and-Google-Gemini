{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"Business Insider Edition  Elon Musk remained the wealthiest person in the world even after losing $29 billion on Monday alone.          Musk was worth $301 billion as of Monday evening, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which updated to reflect stock values as of market close. Musk's net worth on Sunday was $330 billion, meaning it fell 6.7% on Monday.               The net worth drop was fueled by a decline in Tesla's stock price. Tesla's stock fell 15% on Monday, marking its biggest single-day decline since September 2020. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 was down 4% overall while the S&P 500 was down 3%.               Tesla stock is down 55% from its high in December. Musk's net worth is down $132 billion, or more than 30%, this year, according to Bloomberg.               Some Tesla investors are worried the billionaire CEO may be spending too much time in Washington, DC, and not enough focusing on the electric vehicle maker.               Musk has been working closely with President Donald Trump and the DOGE office as it seeks to make cuts to eliminate waste and fraud in the federal government, including by cutting spending and the federal workforce.               Trump has said the Tesla and SpaceX CEO is leading the office, but the White House and the Justice Department have denied it, instead naming another official as the administrator of the DOGE office.               Musk said in an interview with Fox Business that aired Monday that it hadn't been easy to juggle leading his companies, including Tesla and SpaceX, while also working on government efficiency efforts.               When asked how he was doing both, Musk replied, \"With great difficulty,\" followed by a long pause and a sigh.       Tesla facilities have also been the targets of several attacks, including gunshots and other acts of vandalism, that the police have said could be motivated by Musk's politics and government work.               When asked about those incidents during the Fox interview, Musk said that he wanted to eliminate waste and fraud in government and that he believed he was \"doing the right thing.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"Google has been tangled in an antitrust mess since a judge ruled last year that it unfairly dominated the online search market.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  The US Department of Justice is once again pressuring Google to divest Chrome, with the goal of challenging its dominant position in search and promoting fair competition. In a revised filing to Judge Amit Mehta, the DOJ is doubling down on its push for Google to sell off its web browser, and maybe even Android. The agency argues that breaking up these key assets is the only way to fix Google\u2019s monopoly problem. A group of 38 state attorneys general and the DOJ have teamed up to file the updated proposal laying out the final steps to break Google\u2019s illegal stranglehold on the search engine market. It stays close to the original one submitted to Judge Amit Mehta last November, following his historic ruling that Google is a monopoly in online search. In its latest filing, the DOJ argues that forcing Google to sell Chrome would break its grip on a key search gateway, opening the door for real competition. It also kept an earlier proposal to stop Google from cutting deals with companies like Apple, phone manufacturers, and Mozilla to lock in its search engine as the default. A key change in the DOJ\u2019s updated proposal is ditching the demand for Google to sell off its AI investments. Instead of an outright ban, the agency is moving toward a more watchful approach, requiring Google to give regulators a heads-up before making any moves in the AI space. The DOJ is also holding off on forcing Google to sell Android for now. Instead, the court will keep the option on the table, ready to step in if the current fixes don\u2019t level the playing field. If competition doesn\u2019t improve, Google might have to let go of the operating system down the line. Google is expected to counter the proposals with its own. In its December filing, the company slammed the DOJ\u2019s initial demands as over the top, calling them an \"interventionist agenda\" that went way beyond the court\u2019s ruling. Google argued the case was about its deals with partners, not the massive overhaul the DOJ is pushing for.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"Business Insider Edition  TikTok's future may be up in the air in the US, but it's ramping up in other parts of the world.          The company officially launched its e-commerce product, Shop, in Mexico in February after testing it in the country. The platform is still getting off the ground there, but it's attracting local sellers like beauty brands Sarelly, Renova, Pink Up Cosmetics, and Sinless Beauty.               The move across the border is also opening an opportunity for US brands to expand into a fast-growing market \u2014 and hedge against a possible TikTok ban.               Beauty brand KimChi Chic Beauty, supplement brand Beast Bites, and security-camera brand Wyze are among the US companies planning to expand into Mexico, per two Shop agencies that work with the firms.               \"It's a logical play for any seller that saw success or could see success on TikTok Shop,\" said William August, CEO of the social-commerce agency Outlandish, which runs a livestream facility in Los Angeles and recently set up operations in Mexico. \"Regardless of what happens in the US, they should be doing it anyway.\"               TikTok Shop has grown quickly in the US since it first began testing the feature there in 2022. But the app is operating on shaky ground due to a divestment law that requires its Chinese owner, ByteDance, to sell the app or essentially stop operating in the US. While that hasn't deterred many brands that sell goods on TikTok in the US, some are busy diversifying onto other platforms like live-selling app Whatnot or entertainment platforms like Flip and LTK. Moving into other TikTok Shop markets, like the UK, Singapore, and now Mexico, is another tactic.               In some instances, Outlandish is helping US merchants launch in other countries by registering a local business on their behalf, called a merchant of record.               The company also acts as a one-stop shop for other services, like logistics and compliance.               Outlandish set up a joint venture with marketing and retail media firm MindgruveMacarta to help bring US and global brands onto TikTok Shop. In February, Outlandish sent its US livestream training managers to Mexico to teach local staff about selling live, August said. It plans to open a video production hub in the country with the capacity to produce thousands of shopping videos.               \"So long as you have a good product, when you enter a new market with TikTok Shop, you can grow a brand there,\" August said.               Social-commerce agency Orca is also working with third-party logistics providers in Mexico to help US brands start selling in the country, offering services like inventory management and compliance, said its CEO Max Benator. \"If you're a brand in the US, you can't just turn on in Mexico,\" he said.               Shop's entry into a neighboring country allows US sellers to do more than lower their risk from a US ban. It gives them access to an e-commerce market that's on the rise. In September, EMARKETER forecast that e-commerce spending in Latin America would reach close to $180 billion in 2024.               Mexico, in particular, is expected to drive a lot of that growth. In 2024, EMARKETER forecast Mexico would be the fifth-fastest growing e-commerce market in the world, growing online sales by 15.7%.Major retailers like Amazon, Walmart, and Mercado Libre are investing billions of dollars to improve their operations in Mexico and reach a nascent customer base there, according to the firm.               \"Mexico and Latin America are some of the fastest growing e-commerce markets in the world,\" Benator said.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"Business Insider Edition  China's capital, Beijing, is making AI education compulsory for students \u2014 including elementary schoolers.          Starting this fall, schools in the city must provide at least eight hours of AI instruction per academic year, the Beijing Municipal Education Commission said in a statement on Friday. Schools can teach AI as a stand-alone course or integrate it into existing courses like science and information technology.               Under the new plan, elementary schoolers, typically ages six to twelve, would take hands-on courses to kick-start their understanding of AI. Those in middle school would learn how to apply AI in schoolwork and daily life, while high schoolerswould focus on strengthening AI applications and innovation, the agency said.               In China, compulsory education consists of six years of elementary school, three years of middle school, and three years of high school.               The commission said the initiative is meant to create a \"teacher-student-machine\" learning model and integrate AI ethics.               Beijing isn't alone in pushing for AI education in schools. Last year, California passed a law requiring its education board to consider AI literacy in school curricula. Reuters reported in September that Italy would begin testing AI-powered tools in 15 classrooms as part of a broader effort to enhance students' digital skills.               Beijing's decision to make AI education mandatory comes as China powers ahead in the AI race, with its homegrown startups gaining global attention.               Earlier this year, AI startup DeepSeek made headlines after unveiling a low-cost reasoning model that shook up the AI industry and the US stock market. The company said its model rivals top competitors, like ChatGPT's o1, at a fraction of the cost.               Last week, Alibaba's stock surged 8% over two days after the company launched its latest open-sourced AI model, which it said used less data than its rival DeepSeek.       Other Chinese AI stocks, including Tencent, have also seen gains amid excitement for newly announced technology, while top US-based AI stocks, like Nvidia, have faced losses.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"Business Insider Edition  Elon Musk said Monday running his businesses, like Tesla and SpaceX, while also taking on a major government overhaul effort has not been easy.          During an interview with Fox Business that aired Monday, Musk was asked by host Larry Kudlow how he's running his other businesses while also working closely with the Trump White House.               \"With great difficulty,\" Musk said, followed by a long pause and a sigh but not much more explanation.               \"I'm just here trying to make government more efficient, eliminate waste and fraud, and so far we're making good progress, actually,\" Musk added.               His comment came as Tesla stock declined 15% on Monday, its largest single-day drop since 2020. The stock is down 55% from a high in December, causing concern among investors.               Musk is working closely with the DOGE office, which has pushed spending cuts and mass firings at various government agencies. President Donald Trump has credited Musk with leading the office, though other White House officials have denied it.               Musk said in the Fox interview his team is now made up of more than 100 people and that he expects it to reach 200. He also said they have taken action at virtually every government agency when asked by Kudlow if they were now working in all departments.               \"We're trying to make the government more efficient across the board, so yeah,\" Musk said.               When asked about the recent attacks on Tesla facilities, including gun shots fired at a dealership in Oregon and other acts of vandalism, Musk said it has been \"tough\" but that he thinks \"we're doing the right thing here.\"               Musk has been known for investing long hours at his companies, but some investors are worried he's no longer giving Tesla enough of this focus.               \"We think shareholders have legitimate concerns about Elon Musk being spread too thin,\" Garrett Nelson, a senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, told Business Insider's Matthew Fox, \"and it's become clear he's now spending more time on DOGE than anything else.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"     The Federal Reserve's second policy meeting of the year won't change much for mortgage rates in the near term.    The Federal Reserve held interest rates steady at its monetary policy meeting this week \u2014 though sticky inflation, increased unemployment and slowing economic growth could force the central bank to cut rates in late spring or early summer.\u00a0 As recession fears mount and uncertain trade policies pressure financial markets, the key question for investors was how the Trump administration's economic austerity measures and tariffs would\u00a0influence the Fed's\u00a0interest rate forecast.\u00a0 \"Policy is not on a preset course,\" Fed chair Jerome Powell said during Wednesday's press conference. \"We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance, and we are well positioned to wait for greater clarity.\" The Fed is tasked with maintaining maximum employment and containing inflation. A sluggish economy typically warrants interest rate cuts to stimulate growth, but lowering rates too quickly could fuel price growth when inflation is still above target.\u00a0 Still, the Federal Reserve, which sets a short-term benchmark interest rate for lenders, only\u00a0indirectly impacts the mortgage market. In 2024, the central bank cut interest rates three times, but mortgage\u00a0rates didn't fall. That's because rates are primarily driven by movement in the bond market, specifically on the 10-year Treasury yield. Bond yields and interest rates rise or fall depending on how\u00a0new economic data\u00a0shifts market speculation and risk assessment. Until the impact of the administration's policies is clearer, mortgage rates will continue to fluctuate.\u00a0 Read more: How the Federal Reserve's Decision Impacts Mortgage Rates Fannie Mae projects mortgage\u00a0rates to stay above 6.5%\u00a0for the better part of the year. Yet lenders base their rates on a range of factors, and no forecast is set in stone. Given the precarious nature of the economy, any sign of risk or disruption could lower bond yields and impact the trajectory of mortgage rates.\u00a0 If an economic downturn appears likely, for example, mortgage rates could start decreasing, but they would need to drop closer to 5.5% to bring buyers into the market at scale, according to\u00a0Alex Thomas, senior research analyst at John Burns Research and Consulting.\u00a0 While cheaper home loan rates are positive for housing affordability, a shaky economy could keep the housing market frozen. \"If lower mortgage rates are the result of a recession, housing demand could remain muted,\" said Thomas. Prospective homebuyers who have been\u00a0waiting for mortgage rates to drop\u00a0for the past few years may need to adjust to the \"new normal\" in the mortgage market, with rates fluctuating between 5% and 7% over the longer term. That may seem high compared to the recent\u00a02% rates\u00a0of the pandemic era. But experts say getting below 3% on a mortgage is unlikely without a severe economic downturn. Since the 1970s, the average rate for a\u00a030-year fixed mortgage\u00a0has been around 7%.\u00a0 Today's\u00a0unaffordable housing market\u00a0isn't just a result of high mortgage rates. A\u00a0long-standing housing shortage, expensive home prices and a loss of purchasing power due to inflation have locked out buyers over the last several years. With the\u00a0spring homebuying season\u00a0fast approaching, prospective homebuyers are left wondering whether to enter the market or continue waiting on the sidelines. It's never a good idea to rush into\u00a0buying a home\u00a0without establishing a clear budget.\u00a0 Here's what experts recommend before purchasing a home:\u00a0 \ud83d\udcb0 Build your credit score. Your credit score will help determine whether you qualify for a mortgage and at what interest rate. A credit score of 740 or higher will help you qualify for a lower rate. \ud83d\udcb0 Save for a bigger down payment.\u00a0A larger down payment allows you to take out a smaller mortgage and get a lower interest rate from your lender. If you can afford it, a down payment of at least 20% will also eliminate private mortgage insurance. \ud83d\udcb0 Shop for mortgage lenders.\u00a0Comparing loan offers from multiple mortgage lenders can help you negotiate a better rate. Experts recommend getting at least two to three loan estimates from different lenders. \ud83d\udcb0 Consider mortgage points.\u00a0You can get a lower mortgage rate by buying mortgage points, with each point costing 1% of the total loan amount. One mortgage point equals a 0.25% decrease in your mortgage rate.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"Business Insider Edition  AvatarOS is betting that AI can supercharge the market for virtual influencers.          Founded by Isaac Bratzel, the startup is building digital avatars for social media, gaming, apps, and other immersive experiences.               AvatarOS announced this week a $7 million seed investment led by venture capital firm M13. Andreessen Horowitz Games Fund, HF0, Valia Ventures, and Mento VC also participated in the round. AvatarOS has raised $8 million in total since its founding in 2022.               This isn't Bratzel's first rodeo working with digital avatars.               Remember Lil Miquela?               If you don't, she was a pioneering virtual influencer and has over 2 million Instagram followers. Bratzel led the creation of her avatar while at the virtual influencer startup Brud, which was later acquired by NFT startup Dapper Labs in 2021. The Miquela character has been leveraged by brands like Chanel and Prada in marketing campaigns and even has a music career.               Bratzel said Miquela had one major limitation, however. Animation is expensive, and some projects with potential brands or partners simply \"weren't doable,\" he said.               One example, which Bratzel outlines in AvatarOS's investor pitch deck, was Miquela being featured in HBO's hit show \"Euphoria.\"               \"It just wasn't feasible because of the technical limitations,\" Bratzel said. It would have cost about $3,000 per second to animate Miquela, per the pitch deck. With advancements in AI, technical limitations for animation are lower than ever, Bratzel said.               One character already developed by this technology is a version of Bratzel himself (who also makes an appearance in the pitch deck).               M13's Latif Peracha, who led the deal, told BI that while running due diligence on AvatarOS prior to investing, he spoke with this virtual version of Bratzel for an hour, discussing hobbies like running and basketball.               While virtual influencers are one application for AvatarOS, Bratzel said the company is broadly thinking about how any \"character-driven content\" could be used across several platforms, pointing to video games as an example.               \"You have this character, you have all these assets, but the social media and the marketing for how you do that is very disjointed,\" he said.               Bratzel said video game companies could use AvatarOS to create avatars of game characters with their own social media accounts and become virtual influencers for the game brand.               The company is also eyeing partnerships with celebrities and sports figures.               \"It feels like the right time where you can scale this type of application,\" Peracha said.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"President Donald Trump triggered Monday\u2019s stock market sell-off with his shifting tariff policies, which are bad news if they\u2019re tactical and even worse if they\u2019re long-term strategies, market observers said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 890 points, or 2.1%, with the other major market indexes showing even steeper losses. The S&P 500 fell 2.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 4%. Last week was the stock market\u2019s worst in two years. Yields on Treasuries fell as bond investors bet on interest-rate cuts. The president\u2019s sweeping tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China last week \u2014 with the promise of additional duties in the near future \u2014 rattled markets and drove pushback from business groups. Although some exemptions and delays were announced later in the week, Wall Street\u2019s worries weren\u2019t assuaged \u2014 especially after Trump refused to rule out a recession in an interview that aired Sunday. \u201cThis is the first time we\u2019ve seen economic-slowdown fears rattle the market in a bunch of years,\u2019\u2019 said Christopher Grisanti, Mai Capital Management\u2019s chief market strategist. \u201cI\u2019ll certainly pin it on the tariffs.\u201d If the tariffs are purely tactical and short-term \u2014 which Grisanti increasingly doubts \u2014 then they\u2019ll cause enough uncertainty to prompt companies to delay hiring and put off building factories, weighing on economic growth. \u201cInvestors believe a tariff war is inevitable and this will result in economic inefficiencies,\u201d said Ernan Haruvy, an economist and marketing professor at McGill University. \u201cMoreover, the unpredictability of the tariff policy is making markets jittery and they price in the corresponding risk premium.\u201d The next possible catalyst for the market will be inflation numbers due Wednesday, said BeiChen Lin, a strategist at Russell Investments.  \u201cIf inflation were to come in somewhat softer than expected, it could potentially help investors breathe a sigh of relief and stabilize equity markets in the near-term,\u201d Lin wrote in a note. \u201cBut if inflation were to come in hotter than anticipated, that could spook markets.\u201d Looking abroad may be a short-term remedy. \u201cInvestors are rotating from previous market leaders to companies and markets that have lagged,\u201d said Michael Rosen, the CIO of Angeles Investments. Investors, he said, \u201cshould diversify portfolios out of the U.S. as a weaker dollar favors non-U.S. assets.\u201d If Trump continues to hold with the part of his administration that really wants to bring factories back to the U.S. from overseas, it\u2019s a \u201cwhole other ball of wax, and not what the market is expecting,\u201d Mai\u2019s Grisanti said.  That would mean the two pillars of the post-World War II world order \u2014 free trade and NATO \u2014 would both be crumbling.  And that kind of change would \u201cmean much higher costs and take years,\u201d Grisanti said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d have public support for that kind of economic pain.\u201d Given how complicated goods have become, the task might not even be a possible, as it\u2019d be \u201clike unscrambling eggs.\u201d \u201cHe is taking on big structural issues,\u201d Grisanti said, \u201cbut the question is whether the cure is worse than the disease.\u201d Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Either a large, coordinated group and\/or a country is involved,\u201d Musk claimed in a post on X. Appearing on Fox Business' \"Kudlow\" later in the afternoon on Monday, Musk elaborated on the claim, suggesting that the attack may have been linked to Ukraine. \"Well, we don't we're not sure exactly what happened, but there was a massive cyber attack to try to bring down the X system with IP addresses originating in the Ukraine area,\" Musk said. More than 40,000 reports of an outage at X were received on Monday morning by DownDetector, a site that tracks online problem reports from users. ABC News has reached out to X for comment. X has undergone some major outages since Musk acquired the company in 2022. In the aftermath of the acquisition, Musk fired top executives and laid off half of the company's staff. The platform, then known as Twitter, suffered a user outage in February 2023 that lasted for hours and required an emergency fix, prompting an apology from the company. Musk, who has nearly 220 million followers on the platform, has taken a prominent role in the Trump administration as a leading figure behind the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. As of last month, the cost-cutting group had gained access to at least 15 government agencies. In addition to the outages at X, Musk faced challenges at another company that he leads: Tesla.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"Business Insider Edition  Broadcom's aggressive cost-cutting strategy has at least halved VMware's workforce while pleasing Wall Street analysts.          The chip giant closed one of the biggest tech deals ever when it acquired cloud software provider VMware in late 2023. Since closing the acquisition, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan has focused on making the subsidiary more profitable.               Broadcom has been cutting jobs in the past year, including cuts to VMware's salesforce in October and to its professional services team last week, according to current and former employees and LinkedIn posts. In addition, Broadcom has reduced the workforce in other business units or offices over the past few months.               VMware stated that it had more than 38,000 employees as of February 2023, according to a regulatory filing, though many employees\u00a0and\u00a0executives departed\u00a0before the deal closed. Attrition has also contributed to the shrinking workforce.                By this January, VMware had around 16,000 employees, according to two sources. Employees in marketing, partnerships, and VMware Cloud Foundation have been let go over the past few months, according to former staff and LinkedIn posts.       Broadcom has implemented other workplace changes at VMware, such as requiring employees to return to the office. In cases where not enough employees badged into certain offices, Broadcom has shut down those locations and cut staff there, one former employee said. Broadcom did not respond to a request for comment last week.               Tan has concentrated on VMware's largest customers and switched to a subscription-based business model from a perpetual license approach. He said on Thursday's earnings call that 60% of customers had so far been converted.               The company also raised prices. VMware customers have said they've faced massive hikes due to product bundling, which means multiple products are packaged together and customers have to pay for them all.               Broadcom's stock has climbed about 40% in the past year. In December, Broadcom's market cap hit $1 trillion.               Analysts have largely been pleased by Broadcom's handling of the merger integration.               \"The VMware kicker continues to execute, which shouldn't be a surprise, given Hock Tan's expertise on his wash, rinse, and repeat M&A playbook,\" said Dave Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, ahead of Thursday's blockbuster earnings release.           William Blair analysts called VMware the \"star in software,\" saying it was an \"opportunity for Broadcom to drive sustained software growth and potentially reduce the impact of heightened customer churn going into 2027.\"       Following the acquisition, Broadcom made steep job cuts and consolidated teams at VMware, as BI previously reported. Broadcom had cut at least 2,000 employees around that time.               Broadcom also divested some business units,\u00a0such as\u00a0End-User Computing.\u00a0       Have a tip?

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"A former senior Facebook executive has told the BBC how the social media giant worked \"hand in glove\" with the Chinese government on potential ways of allowing Beijing to censor and control content in China. Sarah Wynn-Williams - a former global public policy director - says in return for gaining access to the Chinese market of hundreds of millions of users, Facebook's founder, Mark Zuckerberg, considered agreeing to hiding posts that were going viral, until they could be checked by the Chinese authorities. Ms Williams - who makes the claims in a new book - has also filed a whistleblower complaint with the US markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging Meta misled investors. The BBC has reviewed the complaint. Facebook's parent company Meta, says Ms Wynn-Williams had her employment terminated in 2017 \"for poor performance\". It is \"no secret we were once interested\" in operating services in China, it adds. \"We ultimately opted not to go through with the ideas we'd explored.\" Meta referred us to Mark Zuckerberg's comments from 2019, when he said: \"We could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there, and they [China] never let us in.\" Facebook also used algorithms to spot when young teenagers were feeling vulnerable as part of research aimed at advertisers, Ms Wynn-Williams alleges. A former New Zealand diplomat, she joined Facebook in 2011, and says she watched the company grow from \"a front row seat\". Now she wants to show some of the \"decision-making and moral compromises\" that she says went on when she was there. It is a critical moment, she adds, as \"many of the people I worked with\u2026 are going to be central\" to the introduction of AI. In her memoir, Careless People, Ms Wynn-Williams paints a picture of what she alleges working on Facebook's senior team was like. Mr Zuckerberg, she says, did not get up before midday, loved karaoke and did not like to be beaten at board games, such as Risk. \"I didn't realise that you were supposed to let him win. I was a little naive,\" she told us. However, Ms Wynn-Williams says her allegations about the company's close relationship with China provide an insight into Facebook's decision-making at the time. \"China is Mark Zuckerberg's white whale,\" meaning a goal that he obsessively pursued, says Ms Wynn-Williams. The country is the world's biggest social media market, but access to Facebook remains blocked there, alongside the likes of X and YouTube. \"It's the one piece on the board game that he hasn't conquered,\" she says. Ms Wynn-Williams claims that in the mid-2010s, as part of its negotiations with the Chinese government, Facebook considered allowing it future access to Chinese citizens' user data. \"He was working hand in glove with the Chinese Communist Party, building a censorship tool\u2026 basically working to develop sort of the antithesis of many of the principles that underpin Facebook,\" she told the BBC. Ms Wynn-Williams says governments frequently asked for explanations of how aspects of Facebook's software worked, but were told it was proprietary information. \"But when it came to the Chinese, the curtain was pulled back,\" she says. \"Engineers were brought out. They were walked through every aspect, and Facebook was making sure these Chinese officials were upskilled enough that they could not only learn about these products, but then test Facebook on the censorship version of these products that they were building.\" Meta told the BBC that such claims about China had been \"widely reported\" at the time. In her SEC complaint, Ms Wynn-Williams also alleges Mr Zuckerberg and other Meta executives had made \"misleading statements\u2026 in response to Congressional inquiries\" about China. One answer given by Mr Zuckerberg to Congress in 2018 said Facebook was \"not in a position to know exactly how the [Chinese] government would seek to apply its laws and regulations on content\" Meta told the BBC that Mr Zuckerberg gave accurate testimony, adding it did not operate services in China. Most Facebook executives didn't allow their own children on Facebook - according to Ms Wynn-Williams. \"They had screen bans. They certainly wouldn't allow them to use the product.\" And yet she says reports from 2017 - that the company had been using algorithms to target and categorise vulnerable teens - were true. \"The algorithm could infer that they were feeling worthless or unhappy,\" she alleges. The company - which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp - could, she claims, identify when a teenage girl had deleted a selfie on its platforms, and then notify a beauty company that it would be a good moment to target the child with an advert. Ms Wynn-Williams says she \"felt sick\" at the thought and tried to push back, \"although I knew it was futile\". \"They said: 'The business side thinks this is exactly what we should be doing. We've got this amazing product, we can get young people, which is a really important advertising segment.'\" Meta told the BBC this was false - it has never offered tools to target people based on their emotional state - and that the research it previously did was to help marketers understand how people express themselves on Facebook, not to target ads. Overall, Ms Wynn-Williams says the company has not done enough to address the issue of young people's safety on social media. \"This is one of the most valuable companies in the world. They could invest in this and make it a real priority and do more to fix it.\" Facebook said it was transparent about advert-targeting and had shared updates regarding its approach to creating age-appropriate advert experiences for teens. It also said it had introduced \"Teen Accounts\" for tens of millions of young people with built-in protections. It also said it was giving parents more oversight over their teens' use of the app. As well as poor performance, Meta says the 45-year-old was also fired for \"toxic behaviour\" after she had made \"misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment\". But Ms Wynn-Williams told the BBC she was let go after she had complained about inappropriate comments by one of her bosses - Joel Kaplan, who is now Meta's chief global affairs officer. Meta told us she had been paid by \"anti-Facebook activists\" and she was not a whistleblower. \"Whistleblower status protects communications to the government, not disgruntled activists trying to sell books,\" it said. In regard to Ms Wynn-Williams' book, Meta has confirmed to the BBC that it has launched legal action in the US to \"halt the further distribution of defamatory and untrue information\". To counter this, a legal representative for Ms Wynn-Williams said: \"Meta has made a number of false and inconsistent statements about Sarah since the news of her memoir broke... while Meta's statements are trying to mislead the public, the book speaks for itself\". We asked her why she was speaking out now. She said she wanted Meta to change as it \"influences so much of our day-to-day life\" and we need to ensure \"we get the future we deserve\". \"We're in this moment where tech and political leaders are coming together and as they combine forces, that has a lot of consequences for all of us. \"I think it's really important to understand that and to understand you look at all these engineers who are influencing the highest level of government.\" Social media company wins US emergency ruling preventing ex-director from publicising her book. A jury clears Jamie Michael who posted a 12-minute video days after the Stockport attacks. The president sued the firm in 2021 over the suspension of his accounts after the 6 January Capitol riots. People were targeted after meeting online sellers who claimed to be selling a bicycle, police say. Meta's attempt to lure creators to its platforms comes as questions remain over the future of its main rival in the US. Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"Rep. Ro Khanna is introducing the Drain The Swamp Act. As Democrats attempt to rebound from an underwhelming showing in the 2024 election, California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna is not only taking stock of the stinging defeat last fall, but also taking shots at his own political party. After watching Democrats swap nominees and struggle to deliver a cohesive message to voters in the last campaign cycle, Khanna told ABC News in an exclusive interview that he believes a political reform agenda focused on combating corruption \"is what we should run on in 2026\" and laments the political costs that came as Democrats campaigned on other priorities in 2024. \"It was a mistake,\" Khanna said, adding he \"didn't hear any political reform agenda\" from President Joe Biden or Vice President Kamala Harris during their respective presidential campaigns. \"Trump became the outsider. It was a mistake we didn't run on the theme of reform. Getting money and lobbyists out of politics -- that should be our mantle.\" Now, Khanna is introducing the Drain The Swamp Act, which would permanently prohibit White House officials from accepting gifts from lobbyists -- reinstating a Biden-era mandate that established ethics and lobbying rules for appointees in the administration. \"Anti-corruption has to be core to rebuilding the Democratic brand,\" Khanna, serving in his fifth term, said. \"Democrats need to be seen as owning the mantle of reform.\" Khanna said he finds it striking that one of President Donald Trump's first acts of his second term was to sign an executive order to overturn Biden's order -- creating the impetus to craft an agenda that takes aim at Washington's revolving door between lobbyists and lawmakers. \"It's part of a broader sense that Democrats have to run on anti-corruption,\" Khanna said, complaining that the Democratic Party enabled Trump to \"co-opt\" the \"drain the swamp\" theme of anti-corruption. Khanna said it has cost his party not only two presidential elections in 2016 and 2024, but also majority control of Congress. \"We need to be zealous,\" Khanna said -- explaining his vision for a five-point anti-corruption agenda. Khanna wants to ban former members of Congress from ever lobbying Congress, and he wants to impose 12-year term limits for members and 18-year term limits on Supreme Court justices. Khanna says he believes timed-out justices should return to serve on lower courts after they leave a post on the high court. Khanna also advocates for a \"binding code of ethics\" for Supreme Court justices amid ethics pressure on the court. \"If Democrats want to rebuild, start with anti-political corruption,\" Khanna stressed, adding he has received a positive reception from a range of people such as billionaire Mark Cuban and even Republican voters who are supportive of his pledge to \"drain the swamp.\" Khanna also calls for a ban on members of Congress and their families from holding and trading individual stocks during the member's tenure in office, as well as a ban on members of Congress and candidates running for House or Senate seats from accepting contributions from political action committees. As for his own future political interest -- whether reelection, the California governor's mansion or even the White House in 2028 -- Khanna is keeping his cards close, but his options open. \"Ro believes that anti-corruption and economic patriotism need to be the driving themes of the Democratic Party for 2026 and 2028, regardless of who gets into the fray or leads the party,\" Sarah Drory, a Khanna spokeswoman, told ABC when asked about the congressman's political prospects. Nevertheless, Khanna's profile continues to grow as he faces voters and weighs his future options -- sometimes even before Republican audiences on Fox News or in GOP-held districts. After Trump delivered a joint address to Congress last week, Khanna went on \"Fox News Sunday\" and admitted that it \"was not a good look\" as Democrats protested not only the president, but also rejected the invited guests in the First Lady's box. \"We should have stood for the boy with cancer. You stand for the president of the United States, out of respect for the American people,\" Khanna said on the program. \"I mean, you stand for the widow of the firefighter.\" \"The story should have been on President Trump,\" Khanna continued. \"We should have been talking about the Medicaid cuts. Instead, we're talking about our own behavior. And that's a distraction from us getting out our economic message.\" Khanna will also hold three in-person town hall meetings during a \"Benefits Over Billionaires\" tour on March 23 in GOP-held districts, where his anti-corruption agenda will take stage alongside his progressive bona fides. \"It's smart to have a clear message,\" Khanna told ABC News. \"We're the party that's going to save Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.\" 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":0}

Traders work the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last week. All three major U.S. stock indexes fell significantly Monday, erasing Friday afternoon\u2019s comeback. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.1%, or 890 points, while the S&P 500 declined 2.7% and the Nasdaq Composite sank 4%. The benchmark S&P and the Nasdaq closed at their lowest respective levels since mid September, while the Dow ended at its lowest price since September. Monday was be the Nasdaq\u2019s worst daily decline since September 2022. Driving Monday\u2019s pullback was Trump\u2019s interview with Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d released Sunday, during which Trump declined to rule out a recession, warned of a period of economic \u201ctransition\u201d and cautioned \u201cyou can\u2019t really watch the stock market.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments are \u201cweighing on sentiment\u201d and \u201cdid nothing to ease investor concerns about ongoing policy chaos,\u201d Sevens Report founder Tom Essaye wrote in a Monday note to clients. Trump may say to heed little attention to near-term stock moves, but the losses are staggering. The Nasdaq is in correction territory, declining 13% from its closing price on Feb. 19, when the market took a sharply negative turn. The S&P is down 9% during that period, while the Dow is down 6%, or 2,700 points. The S&P is fresh off of its worst week since September, declining 3.1% last week. Big Tech stocks are the most notable individual losers during the brutal three-week stretch, namely artificial intelligence chip architect Nvidia and electric vehicle maker Tesla, led by Trump administration official Elon Musk. Shares of Nvidia dipped 5% on Monday, extended its loss dating back to Feb. 19 to 23%, and shares of Tesla fell 14%, pushing its loss dating back to Feb. 19 to 37%. Also sinking Monday were shares of Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta, as each Silicon Valley giant sank about 5% as investors fled to safety. 20%. That\u2019s about how much the \u201cmagnificent seven\u201d group of big American tech companies \u2014 Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 is collectively down from its December record, according to Bloomberg. The recent decline coincided with Trump\u2019s implementation of tariffs, which are largely a bad thing for stocks as they can hurt corporate profit margins and soften consumer demand. But even beyond any negative direct effects of tariffs, markets have responded negatively to Trump\u2019s frequent waffling on when the duties will go into effect, as well as what goods. \u201cThe reason stocks are dropping is the spike in uncertainty and fear that uncertainty will lead to a whole host of negatives,\u201d explained Essaye. To that end, the new fear of the U.S. entering a recession has become a topic of conversation. Goldman Sachs economists increased their recession forecast Friday, calling for 20% odds of a significant downturn over the next 12 months, up from 15%, citing trade policies. Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael Wilson maintained their 6,500 price target for the S&P by the end of 2025, calling for a 16% gain from Monday\u2019s roughly 5,610. Trump\u2019s policies will be \u201csequenced in a more growth-negative way to start the year before\u201d lower interest rates and friendlier corporate policies \u201cbenefit the market later in the year,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cThis is a headline driven market, one that could change in an hour.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"Stocks fell sharply on Monday as Wall Street\u2019s fears tied to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs continue to pressure the market and investors wait for new economic data, especially inflation on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 890 points, or 2.1%. But the other major market indexes saw even steeper losses: The S&P 500 fell 2.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 4%. Last week was the stock market\u2019s worst in two years. The yields on Treasury bonds dropped today as investors bet that a slowing economy will prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. \u201cUncertainty about U.S. trade policy and weaker economic data are leading to investor caution,\u201d Angeles Investments CIO Michael Rosen told Quartz. Investors, he said, \u201care rotating from previous market leaders to companies and markets that have lagged. Investors should diversify portfolios out of the U.S. as a weaker dollar favors non-U.S. assets.\u201d The so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks also lost ground. Tesla (TSLA+5.27%) stock dropped 15%, erasing its post-election rally. Nvidia (NVDA+2.83%) stock was off 5.1%, bringing its slide so far this year to about 23% amid tariff and recession fears. The president\u2019s sweeping tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China last week \u2014 with the promise of additional duties in the near future \u2014 rattled stock markets and drove pushback from business groups. Although some exemptions and delays were announced later in the week, Wall Street\u2019s worries weren\u2019t assuaged. Goldman Sachs (GS+1.35%) said Friday that the likelihood of a recession within the next 12 months has increased from 15% to 20%. If the White House continues with additional tariffs, the bank said the risk of a recession would increase. On Sunday, Trump was asked by Fox News (FOXA+0.88%) host Maria Bartiromo if he was expecting a recession this year. The president didn\u2019t rule it out as a potential outcome. \u201cI hate to predict things like that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThere is a period of transition, because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We\u2019re bringing wealth back to America. That\u2019s a big thing, and there are always periods of, it takes a little time. It takes a little time, but I think it should be great for us.\u201d Cabinet officials have largely brushed off the market\u2019s decline, even as they acknowledge some signs of weakness in the economy.  Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC that the market has \u201cjust become hooked\u201d on government spending and that \u201cthere\u2019s going to be a detox period.\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the U.S. would stick to its future tariff plans, said he wouldn\u2019t bet on a recession, and said the stock market doesn\u2019t affect federal policy. \u2014Josh Fellman contributed to this article.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"After Donald Trump was named the president-elect of the United States, Tesla (TSLA+5.27%) stock roared, reaching new highs. But backlash over CEO Elon Musk\u2019s relationship with the president has erased all of those gains.  As of publication, Tesla stock goes for $242.25 per share, after falling by more than 8% in midday trading on Monday. Since January 1, the stock has fallen by more than 36%.  That brings the stock back to where it was on November 4, 2024, the day before the presidential election. At the time, the stock was valued at $242.84 per share.  The stock\u2019s decline has been accelerated by poor sales in January and February, from Australia to Norway, partly due to Tesla factories preparing for a refreshed Model Y SUV and partly due to outrage over Musk\u2019s politics.

Today, I\u2019m talking with Almar Latour, who is the publisher of The Wall Street Journal and CEO of its parent company Dow Jones, which you can think of as a huge research and data provider for companies of all sizes. Dow Jones itself is part of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp.  Latour is a fascinating guy. He started as a news assistant at the Journal in the \u201990s, spent time as a tech reporter, and eventually rose through the ranks to become CEO in 2020, putting him in charge of how everything makes money. And if you\u2019ve been paying attention, you know it\u2019s a tough time to be making money in the news business, especially the paid news business. In addition to competing with the flood of free content on various social and streaming platforms, the industry is also facing new challenges like fights about copyright and AI and battles with the Trump administration, which has been pushing hard to shut down critical reporting and limit press freedom. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge\u2019s Nilay Patel about big ideas \u2014 and other problems. Subscribe here! Latour has insight into all of that: On the news side, he\u2019s made a big content-use deal with OpenAI while also suing Perplexity for training without permission. On the other side, he\u2019s pushing to build his own AI data products for Dow Jones customers.  He is a fierce defender of press freedom who fought to have Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich released from Russia after being imprisoned for more than a year. But at the same time, he works at News Corp, whose chairman, Rupert Murdoch, has deep ties to President Donald Trump and who has overseen a vastly polarized and politicized era of news media. So I asked Latour about all of that and really pushed him on a few of his answers \u2014 even right at the top of the conversation, when I asked him about the Journal cutting a huge chunk of its tech reporting team literally the day before we recorded. To his credit, Latour was game and he hung in there, but you\u2019ll hear him congratulate me for almost getting him to slip up. I did my best; I think many of you will have thoughts about it. Okay: Almar Latour, CEO of Dow Jones and publisher of The Wall Street Journal. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.  Almar Latour, you are CEO of Dow Jones and the publisher of The Wall Street Journal. Welcome to Decoder. Great to be here. Thank you. I have a lot to talk about with you. There\u2019s an entire set of complicated AI questions that might be existential for the media industry, but you\u2019re heavily invested in building some of that technology and some of those services, which I think is interesting. There\u2019s the general state of the press in 2025, which I want to talk to you about. I know you\u2019re very interested in press freedom.  But it happens that I have you on the day after the news, so I want to start with the news. Just last night, The Wall Street Journal, of which Dow Jones is the publisher, restructured how it covers tech and media. That involved cutting about 10 or 15 editors and reporters. Obviously, I\u2019m very interested in how you structure a newsroom to cover tech. Why make that decision? Why get smaller? First, this is a newsroom decision, so this is squarely in the terrain of [editor-in-chief] Emma Tucker, who\u2019s a new editor, relatively speaking. She\u2019s in year two, moving into year three. Emma was hired with a remit of helping to increase engagement with our existing readers, to expand our readership, and to maintain and enhance the quality of our coverage. She has set out over the past two years to rethink how she wants to offer news with The Wall Street Journal newsroom.  Her consistent message, and this is one that I subscribe to, is that distinctive journalism is what makes the difference. It\u2019s about knowing the interesting story, the story behind the story, and to have exclusive journalism and insights. That I say as a preface because Emma has been making changes to nearly every part of The Wall Street Journal and continues to do that. So what happened yesterday was a continuation of that. Generally, when you look at the changes that she\u2019s brought in \u2014 I\u2019m not speaking specifically about the San Francisco bureau but tech \u2014 it\u2019s been new talent. She has an antenna for what she thinks works there. And one of the areas where that\u2019s been very pronounced in recent months is in Washington, D.C. That has gone through several cycles of changes. She\u2019s brought in new people, and that has had consequences. The marching orders are slightly different when there is a closer connection to the center of the newsroom, where the decisions about news can be made in the context of a broader story that\u2019s happening around the world, rather than in isolation around a certain topic. So that\u2019s the context for yesterday.  I\u2019m not going to comment on specific individuals or Emma\u2019s specific plans. I\u2019ll leave that to her. I\u2019ve worked with quite a few of those people. As you know, I was a tech reporter myself. But overall, what Emma has focused on, and what the Journal and Dow Jones are focusing on, is going deeper and having more exclusivity, more \u201cproprietary content.\u201d Moments like yesterday are absolutely never easy. I think I see a thesis of Dow Jones as a company, and we\u2019ll get to the big picture in a second here. The idea is you\u2019re going to give a bunch of people in the business world an information edge, whether it\u2019s with the Dow Jones Information Services, some of the AI tools, or with The Wall Street Journal, which gets a bunch of scoops and tells people stuff they didn\u2019t know before.  I\u2019m just looking at this broadly. I\u2019m looking at Dow Jones as part of News Corp. I\u2019m looking at News Corp\u2019s financials from last month. Revenue at Dow Jones is up to $600 million. That\u2019s up 3 percent. Your earnings are up 7 percent to $174 million. But the cuts are in tech, which is dominating the world. I\u2019m just wondering about that resource allocation because that\u2019s the role of the publisher. Well, it is in the sense that the newsroom has a budget, and we support quality journalism. Frankly, we are so successful at this moment as a company that all of our investments are in enhancing the quality of our journalism, data, analytics, etc. Getting better news, getting better information is the mission, and we are investing in that. So, I just want to correct one simplification that sometimes comes to the surface at moments like this. I don\u2019t think you intended to do that, but I think it\u2019s important to make a distinction. It\u2019s super hard when you go through what happened yesterday and many other times in journalism. But this shift, like any other shift that Emma has gone through, is not to eke out more profit by having fewer resources. There is an overall climate inside our company. You see our earnings, revenue, and subscription base growing. We will invest wherever there\u2019s a good business case to be made. Tech and the cross section of tech with policy, politics, global trade, and society is one of the top priorities for Dow Jones, and one of the top stories in the world. So, don\u2019t take a snapshot and say, \u201cOkay, we\u2019re going to stop there.\u201d This is a top priority. Tech will permeate everything \u2014 it is permeating everything right now. Look at Washington, D.C. or at the announcements from President Emmanuel Macron in France. So, don\u2019t take the snapshot, that is where I was headed. This is a moment in time. We can talk again in a year, and our tech coverage should be broader, deeper and probably have a larger following. I run a tech publication \u2014 what is nominally a tech publication \u2014 and we are heavily invested in covering policy. One of the lines we\u2019ve always used, a cliche even, is that, \u201cThe Verge can cover everything because everything is now a tech story.\u201d That was a way 10 years ago of maintaining a broad focus, and now, it\u2019s very real. Elon Musk is at the State of the Union. You can see the tech giants fighting tooth and nail against the Digital Services Act in the EU, and that is now a part of American foreign policy. Do you see that as, \u201cOkay, maybe all of The Wall Street Journal is about tech in that way?\u201d Is that getting more expansive for you? There is a current of tech that runs through every story at The Wall Street Journal. It runs through everything at Dow Jones in two ways: as a story and as technology. There\u2019s not a part of The Wall Street Journal or Dow Jones where tech does not feature. Having people cover tech in isolation is one way of covering this. In addition, tech is a core part of many other beats and areas that we cover. Tech is a horizontal and a vertical at the same time. We\u2019ll come back to the AI deals you\u2019ve struck. I want to talk about them expansively. Just in this context, like so many publishers, you\u2019ve struck a deal with OpenAI and other AI companies. Are those providing enough revenue for you to invest against in the newsroom, or are you still in wait-and-see mode with those deals? I don\u2019t think we should tether our investments in AI to any individual AI deal. That\u2019s not how I look at it. It\u2019s not like, \u201cOh, AI brings in this much money, and now I can invest this much in AI.\u201d You could, I guess, rationalize it that way. Or the newsroom. AI in the newsroom or in the newsroom [itself]. We have our investment priorities, and we\u2019re following a game plan that we\u2019ve been following for a while. It meanders every once in a while, but the goal is pretty clear. We intend on growing in three ways. One is by going deeper, so investing in the depth of our content, our data, and our analytics by growing wider.  We do this by adding new areas of expertise. Just last week, we announced our agreement to acquire Oxford Analytica. Going deep into geopolitics is an addition. But in future investments, once it\u2019s a part of Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal, we will probably invest in going deeper into that area of geopolitics.  Then, the third wave is by connecting everything that we have. There should be easier access to the data that underlies everything at Dow Jones and everything that we do at The Wall Street Journal. Now, to your question, investing in the newsroom is a goal in itself. We are a successful, leading, subscription-driven news organization, and we grow by investing in our journalism, not by shrinking our journalism. Sometimes there\u2019s a temptation to be in austerity mode and to just take away in order to eke out a profit. That\u2019s not us, and that\u2019s not how we\u2019re growing whatsoever. I think it\u2019s more than a temptation for most media businesses right now. That is the reality of the situation, right? It costs more to make the information than most people can return on it. Yeah, but if your answer to that time and time again is, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll cut in order to make ends meet,\u201d then you\u2019re not addressing something at the base. You\u2019re not addressing something in your model. You might not be addressing something correctly in the way you\u2019re organized or where you\u2019re focused. That, to me, was never an acceptable method to grow or create great journalism. I understand that sometimes you have your back against the wall as a company in any industry. You may have to cut in order to make ends meet, but that\u2019s not a strategy. People get that wrong. I think you\u2019re absolutely right. That might be a prevailing tendency, but I don\u2019t think it should be. The prevailing focus should be about making a difference in the news and information that you offer. How do you make that distinctive? How do you add value? How do you allow people to make decisions based on that? How do you convince people that they should recognize the value of the information that you offer?  People in the past used to say, \u201cYou\u2019re a subscription business. You\u2019re The Wall Street Journal. You\u2019re all about business, and therefore, that doesn\u2019t apply to anything else.\u201d I don\u2019t think that is true. I think people recognize the value of a lot of different types of information. It doesn\u2019t just have to be about business. So, I actually think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity in shifting from this austerity mode to creation and building mode. Easier said than done, and sometimes, you have to step away from things that just aren\u2019t working. I think that recognition of value is very challenging. I understand why it happens in the business community. I even understand why it happens for us in the tech press because it\u2019s often tradable. You can pay a high rate to The Wall Street Journal if you are a Wall Street trader, an investor, or some other kind of business professional because the information has a clear value that you can use to trade upon to make a deal or an investment, to buy or sell a stock. I think that information is not tradeable for the average consumer. They just open TikTok. Maybe there\u2019s some influencer reading The Wall Street Journal to them for free. That elimination of scarcity, I think, has been the fundamental challenge. It was the challenge when we went to social media, the challenge when we went to these social video platforms. It feels like the challenge again for AI, right? The AI platforms are going to take all of the world\u2019s information and completely eliminate even the scarcity of having to click. They\u2019re just going to tell you what the models have read on the internet. Do you perceive that as existential a challenge as some of your peers in the media do? I think you\u2019re absolutely right in that the bar on being distinctive with the content, news, or information that you create has gone way up. So, you have to be more discerning where you focus. You ask about the existential threat around AI, and that goes back to the recognition of value. I want to make sure that the industry \u2014 certainly Dow Jones, The Wall Street Journal, and all of our publications \u2014 don\u2019t fall into a trap that is similar to two decades ago when all information had to be free, people took scraps from search engines,. and then found out over time that they\u2019ve effectively lost, that we seeded that market. So, that\u2019s why we are investing time and resources right now into making sure that large players in the AI space recognize that value. Our push is to make sure that there is a commercial agreement around that. And I think that is the preferred outcome in many cases on both sides of that fence. Where we can\u2019t reach a commercial agreement, where there are fundamental differences of opinion, we are prepared, in some cases, to say, \u201cThen we\u2019ll fight it out in court.\u201d So, we\u2019ve walked both paths, with a preference for the first.  I\u2019m still answering your question as to what\u2019s existential here and is there an existential threat. You spun it forward and we can get through that, what it means for the end user and how consumers respond to that. But I think first, we have to get the starting blocks. These are the companies that are providing generative AI, UX, and new interactions for consumers. They have gotten to that point by using information. We need an acknowledgement that the information that has value, certainly our information, and that if you want to use that information on an ongoing basis, that some of your generative AI-produced content answers to queries are current and reliable. You\u2019ll have to pay us for access if you value that. That part we cannot skip over. There\u2019s a whole other part of this where we don\u2019t yet exactly know how the user is going to interact, but we see the trending there. We have to get that part right. We\u2019re in the middle of that, or maybe we\u2019re at the first part of that still. I\u2019m going to ask you one more very existential philosophical question, and I need to get back to having you explain the company \u2014  Yeah. All my favorite topics. There\u2019s that line, that a lie goes around the world six times when the truth is putting on shoes. It feels like we might be describing a world where regular people are awash in a sea of free lies that come to them on social media. The social media companies are all giving up on fact checks. Various billionaires say whatever they want on podcasts with no pushback. And what you are providing is a very expensive source of truth, or hopefully what I am providing is an affordable source of truth. That\u2019s a big discrepancy, right? I would say we\u2019re as affordable as a cup of coffee a day. Everyone drinks coffee. I think it\u2019s a myth that access to reliable information is unaffordable. It is an individual choice. I realize it\u2019s a hard choice to make if you don\u2019t have significant disposable income, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re indicating, but I do believe that there\u2019s a choice to be made. I understand why people would buy The Wall Street Journal or some of Dow Jones\u2019 products, which we should come to. But that\u2019s the bigger picture, right? It\u2019s convincing the next consumer that they should pay for information as opposed to picking a filter bubble on social media. Whether that\u2019s AI, social media, or if it\u2019s just algorithms, that seems like the challenge the media faces. The challenge is to convince someone that it\u2019s to their benefit to invest in having access to reliable information. Whether that\u2019s for making decisions in the realm of investments, technology, policy, or whether it\u2019s hyperlocal and I actually want to understand what\u2019s going on in my community, some of that I might get from AI. But some of that I might not. I might want to invest a small amount of money into understanding what\u2019s happening in my community. There\u2019s some examples of that popping up. In response to this huge question that you\u2019re asking, I think we\u2019ll see innovation in journalism and a lot of creativity \u2014 already and in years to come \u2014 where, undeniably, there\u2019s this flood of information of mixed quality.There\u2019s also, undeniably, a huge demand for reliable information. People are craving it more than ever before. In fact, the more noise there is, the more people are confused and the more they are asking, \u201cHey, tell me what this means.\u201d  We see this in our data. We see this when there are moments of friction in society, in business, or in geopolitics with any market. We see a spike and people coming to us for free, but we also see a spike in subscriptions. Demand for reliable information, I think, has gone up as the pool of unreliable or uncertain information has grown. Some of it might be reliable, some of it might not be. I think you cast that as an existential risk. I can cast that as an opportunity. I like to be aware of the existential risk and take the precautions there, but mainly focus on the opportunity and meeting that demand. I don\u2019t think we have met that demand by any stretch. I think there\u2019s a huge opportunity for us and for other publications in lying ahead to meet that demand. I think that demand will actually only grow. This is a good place to back up a little. We\u2019ve talked a lot about The Wall Street Journal. I think people know about The Wall Street Journal. I think Decoder listeners also probably know about Rupert Murdoch and News Corp, which is the parent company of The Wall Street Journal. Describe how all of that fits together in your role as CEO of Dow Jones. In its most simplified form, I think of Dow Jones as a Rubik\u2019s Cube, and inside is all of our premium journalism, exclusives, or explanations of what\u2019s happening right now. There\u2019s our proprietary data that we have on many different sectors in the global economy. There\u2019s Factiva with thousands and thousands of sources from around the world sitting inside that Rubik\u2019s Cube.  Each tile on that Rubik\u2019s Cube is a way to get out of Dow Jones what is important and relevant to you. Maybe I want a couple of different tiles or maybe I want the whole thing, but that\u2019s fundamentally a way of thinking about how we operate and how, ultimately, we\u2019re organized. AI is actually helping a great deal with this and it\u2019s accelerating with generative AI. AI and automation has been with Dow Jones for a long, long time. Let\u2019s then make that a little bit more complex. If one of those tiles is about bond trading, I ought to be able to get all information: premium information and live information, but also analytics and forecasting to help me in my job. We\u2019ll get to AI in a moment, but the cards I was dealt when I took over almost five years ago as CEO was to look at Dow Jones as a platform of verticals.  You\u2019ve got business news, which is both a horizontal and a vertical, but that\u2019s The Wall Street Journal, as you say. It needs no huge explanation there. There\u2019s wealth and investing, where we have Barron\u2019s, MarketWatch, Financial News, which is a title in the U.K., and Private Equity News. We\u2019ve got a compliance arm that has data on compliance. It helps companies discern, \u201cShould I do business with this person or not? Are they on a sanctions list or not?\u201d We\u2019ve since added an energy arm and within that, commodities and petrochemicals. We\u2019ve added a leadership arm, organically, looking at what it takes to be a modern leader.  Each of these verticals, if you will, is successful when it does four things. You have to have leading news in that particular vertical, in that particular area of concentration. So pick your industry. Unless you have that, you\u2019re not relevant. Second, you have to have proprietary data. Some of that can come out of the news, some of it you have to build, some of it you have to buy, and we\u2019ve done that. If you have those two things, you can do proper analytics. AI helps with that to some degree. If you sell products that can do forecasting and analytics, that\u2019s where the value keeps going up. Then, the fourth factor is convening power \u2014 that is bringing people in that industry, in that sector, in that vertical together. If you have those four, you actually get a mini-network effect inside that industry. We\u2019ve seen that happen, and it happened by design. We\u2019ve executed this with our manager, Joel Lange, who runs our risk and compliance business. If you have all those four parts, then you see the leaders in that industry come together. Take risk and compliance. You see compliance officers coming together and our [Chief Compliance Officer Council] at Davos and in other places. So, now you have thought leaders there. Well, the procurement officers who buy our data products see, \u201cOh, yeah, the people that are leading my department or leading my company are talking on a Dow Jones platform about these big themes.\u201d So it anchors Dow Jones more deeply, whether that\u2019s just an observation and anecdotal or whether that actually translates into business. Often it translates into business. That has the same effect on our analytical products. Then if you add news to that risk vertical \u2014 we have mentioned internally that we will have a risk journal \u2014 you will have risk industry folks, compliance officers and the like, tap into that news product to actually start their workday and understand what\u2019s happening. Now, we are present in your workflow in that industry end to end. By the way, since we\u2019re The Wall Street Journal, we\u2019re probably also still with you in another way when you go home. So that\u2019s the view of the company and our operating model. Build verticals that have these four parts at a minimum. Go deeper and make that exclusive. This is why what Emma is doing in the The Wall Street Journal newsroom really matters. More exclusives and more distinctive journalism helps with the news obviously.  We\u2019ve built, bought, and created more proprietary data. We\u2019ve spent well in excess of $1 billion on getting companies that are specialized in that added to our roster. We\u2019re doing more analytics and even a little bit of consulting. We\u2019re never going to be a consulting company, but that\u2019s an outflow of analytics. Then,there\u2019s convening power. I think for a long time, the media sort of misread that as just events, but it\u2019s something far bigger than that. I think it\u2019s a subscription business.It\u2019s a recurring revenue business, it should be. It doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t have sponsorship for it, but it is fundamental to anchoring the decision-makers of a certain industry in your platform. When we have all four parts, we call it a full stack. So we\u2019ve got a full stack in risk. We\u2019re building a full stack in energy and subsets of energy, so we\u2019re going deeper there. And it\u2019s a scalable model for the future because we now understand how to build these verticals. Either we can mine The Wall Street Journal for new verticals because we see what people gravitate to and where we have the expertise, and then build on that. We can inorganically add as well, or we can organically start outside The Wall Street Journal newsroom. So going deeper, going wider, and then connecting everything. Let\u2019s go back to the Rubik\u2019s Cube, if you want to buy that whole Rubik\u2019s Cube, we will also make that possible for you. So we\u2019re making sure that these magnificent data pools are going to be available. Some of this is, of course, still in the works but going to be available to our journalists so that they can do exclusive work with it. You\u2019re describing Dow Jones as something that makes really high-quality, rigorous information across newspapers, magazines, and data products and that sits within News Corp. How often do you hang out with [Founder] Rupert Murdoch? I wouldn\u2019t put it in the category of hanging out whatsoever. There\u2019s healthy, friendly interaction. He\u2019s chairman emeritus, he\u2019s built the caricature on the side. He\u2019s built enormous media success stories over time. And so, from a business point of view, there was a lot to learn from him, certainly in my early days, like, \u201cHow do you create businesses?\u201d But from News Corp, there\u2019s been nothing but support for our growth story. So I\u2019m very thankful for that. It\u2019s Rupert, it\u2019s [Chair] Lachlan [Murdoch], and also [CEO] Robert Thompson, that\u2019s a whole apparatus. But we also have access to capital as Dow Jones. Five years ago, we hadn\u2019t done an acquisition for well over a decade. Now we\u2019ve done billions in acquisitions. That support is a vote of confidence for the direction that we\u2019re taking, for the strategy that I outlined to you: growing deeper, growing wider, connecting things. There\u2019s also a deep respect for the independence of The Wall Street Journal and the value that comes with that. I\u2019ve seen that consistently applied. So yeah, that\u2019s my answer to your hangout question. Rupert Murdoch plays on both sides of the information crisis. You can watch his other properties create whatever reality is politically expedient for Donald Trump. And then I see The Wall Street Journal rigorously cover the impact of tariffs all the way down to the opinion pages, which sometimes say the tariffs are bad. Oh no, the opinion pages don\u2019t just say tariffs are bad. Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau said in a press conference \u2014 I\u2019m paraphrasing here \u2014 \u201cI don\u2019t often quote The Wall Street Journal, but they said that this trade war is the stupidest trade war in history.\u201d Something along those lines. We don\u2019t hold back. Our opinion pages don\u2019t hold back, and their assessment is based on well-established principles of free markets and free people. The independence to make that judgment is core to who we are. For my part, I\u2019m focused on the Dow Jones part, of making sure that sings. But do you see that contradiction? Do you think your team sees that contradiction, that you\u2019re trying to sell really high-quality information while another part of the structure that has the same ownership is contributing to an information crisis? Listen, I can\u2019t comment because of the shared ownership structure. I\u2019m not going to comment on my colleagues at Fox. We had protesters outside in Fox Square, and people are protesting while the reporters at The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones are doing their jobs. So, there is an awareness of the perception of Fox and what we\u2019re focused on. I think there\u2019s also a great awareness amongst our staff, and has been for over 15 years, that those two things are separate \u2014 without specifically commenting on how you characterize that, because I am just not going to get into that. That makes sense. I want to ask the last Decoder question, and I want to end by talking about AI at length. You\u2019ve had to make a lot of decisions. You\u2019ve changed the way the company works a lot. You obviously have a way of thinking about the company that\u2019s very specific. Although I will say that Rubik\u2019s Cubes are meant to be solved. I think you want them to remix the cube, not solve it. But what\u2019s your framework there? How do you make decisions? I take in information a lot. I like to be, probably to a fault, familiar with the facts on the ground, so I am very consultative, take in expertise, and absorb. So, I feel like I have a sufficient level of mastery to then make a decision. So that\u2019s one part. I\u2019m very inquisitive. The strength of good journalists is that they know how to ask questions, and they\u2019re driven by curiosity. As a company, we\u2019re driven by curiosity. As an executive, I\u2019m driven by curiosity. I want to figure out how things interact, to understand the nuances. That\u2019s for my part. I also, at the same time, believe in letting managers manage or creators create, and making sure that what I\u2019m doing is to help make those managers or those creators successful. It depends on where we\u2019re focused. If we\u2019re focused on something that is important for the whole company, I will be informed and I will make the decision by consulting my management team. Within the framework of the strategy that I\u2019ve outlined and the intricacies of that, I am a firm believer in letting the managers make decisions. So, I have a very flat structure where there is a lot of autonomy to, within that framework, make decisions. I think that allows people to move faster and allows the company to move faster. It allows us to experiment without going through a central clearinghouse constantly. So, I want both. On the one hand, I want the expertise so I\u2019m informed. There\u2019s a limit to that because you can\u2019t do that when you are thinking about everything\u2019s macro issues. I have to be judicious in how I do that, where I focus that thirst. On the other hand, we have that flat structure and empower people. Let\u2019s apply that framework to AI. I think it\u2019s useful to have the framework where we talk about this next set of big shifts because that\u2019s a lot of decisions. You mentioned Factiva earlier. That\u2019s a data platform. You\u2019re promising some generative AI tools there. You want to offer more of those tools to your customers across the board. You\u2019ve made some deals with OpenAI, but at the same time, you\u2019re suing Perplexity. You think it\u2019s taking information away without compensating you. You made a deal with OpenAI at some rate, we can talk about whether that rate is enough. And then you\u2019re offering the tools to the users. What is the shape of the AI opportunity to you? When you look at that whole set, the number one question to me is, \u201cHow big of a business is this really?\u201d Because I don\u2019t know if anyone\u2019s making more money from AI than they\u2019re spending on building the tools right now. We are in a very, very early stage in that, so it\u2019s hard to say. What I can say is that on the product side, some of our products outperform versus what we had planned for them. We have a product in our risk business called Integrity Check. It\u2019s more of a self-serve model where you don\u2019t have to wait for Dow Jones to get back to you and do its computation \u2014 using AI ourselves but out of the view of the customer. Instead, we\u2019re having the customer do some basic research on risk and compliance themselves, assessing who they can do business with, and getting that to an 80 percent reliability. From there, they use that as a springboard to say, \u201cNow, with the remaining 20 percent, I need help from the company.\u201d  That product is fairly young, and that\u2019s outperforming expectations. On the whole, I think this will be a net positive, but we\u2019ve got to unpack what we\u2019re talking about first. We\u2019ve got to get the foundational elements of this right. If we don\u2019t have proprietary information that is truly proprietary, then we\u2019re going to lose this game. You see us engage in building products, building a marketplace with Factiva, and deploying tools internally, but all of that has to happen in tandem with solving that foundational question. Last summer, the deal with OpenAI, the reporting was that it\u2019s worth about $250 million. Is that correct? Read The Wall Street Journal. That\u2019s The Wall Street Journal\u2019s side, so I believe them. I had Nicholas Thompson, the CEO of The Atlantic on the show a few months ago. He told me one of the reasons that he made a deal with OpenAI was to set the market rate, which is useful for fair-use litigation and for other kinds of deals. Do you think $250 million is enough of a rate to set the market? I\u2019m not going to talk about specific amounts, but you\u2019ve got to ask what the amount is for. What I am personally less interested in is a single amount and more in an operating model and a business model for how you do business over a long period of time. How does that operate? When information is used, is the value of that information recognized along the way, and is there a mechanism that helps in realizing that valuation? Set the dollars aside, inside of the OpenAI deal, what are the signals you\u2019re looking for that indicate whether the deal was a success or a failure? Simply because of the way we\u2019ve set up that deal. I\u2019m not going to talk specifically about it. That was a super nice try because I almost bit.  I\u2019m going to try it again, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m sure you will. I can talk more broadly. How can you tell the generative AI tools that you\u2019re deploying or the models that you\u2019re deploying within your own business are successful? That\u2019s by usage. Is it generating revenue on a consistent basis? Is it just a blurb? Like, \u201c It\u2019s a novelty factor, and now we move on?\u201d We\u2019re pretty early in that process, so I don\u2019t know yet what\u2019s a head fake and what\u2019s real. Some of the products, I can tell, are real. Some of it requires a shift in user experience and user requirements. This is going to have to be table stakes, like offering a UX that is built around generative AI because the customer expects that. So, you\u2019re getting at the trickiness of establishing the value writ large. But overall, I think of generative AI as an accelerant for the strategy that we have. It will allow us to go deeper in our verticals faster and more efficiently, and in ways that we couldn\u2019t even imagine. We\u2019ve all talked about the wonders of generative AI, in doing research in ways that we couldn\u2019t do before, human and otherwise. Within Dow Jones, we talk about authentic intelligence. That\u2019s the combination of generative AI and human guidance. We find that that\u2019s a sweet spot for certain B2B products that we\u2019re building. It\u2019s accelerating, going deeper. It will accelerate going wider, i.e., scaling our vertical strategy because we can stand up verticals much faster. If it\u2019s a geographic vertical, we can now say, \u201cAll right, we can launch in this language, and it\u2019s so reliable and it\u2019s a lot cheaper.\u201d And then connecting everything, generative AI is a massive accelerant because now with a thin layer on top, we can extract data from all these different data pools. Do the tools work well enough for you to trust it? On a case-by-case basis, when it\u2019s very specific and we are answering a question from a customer. If it\u2019s a co-creation where we are solving a certain problem and we have very narrow parameters, then I think it works. When you go wide, you get a wide answer. So, our strategy is built around being specific and being focused on verticals. AI fits nicely with that, and in fact, it allows us to go much deeper, be much more specific, and be more discerning. Under each vertical, you can create sub-verticals using a much larger data pool. You\u2019re describing something that happens within Dow Jones and its products. More broadly, News Corp has been pretty harsh about platforms and work. News Corp CEO Robert Thompson is famously critical of Google, in part resulting in the laws in Australia that require platforms to pay publishers for linking. AI represents that opportunity as well, or that challenge as well. Instead of using your tools, someone might use a ChatGPT or a Google Gemini, and just receive an answer. Do you think that these deals you\u2019re making are hedges against that outcome? Are they investments in that outcome?  I\u2019ll just give the example of the millennial digital media startup boom, which was predicated on \u201cwe will just be the most viral thing on Facebook, and Facebook will pay us that money.\u201d That obviously did not pan out. I think people are very wary of making that same mistake with AI. But you have one of these deals. This is why I said at the very start that I see those deals in a separate category. It\u2019s foundational, it\u2019s about principles. The money to be made in AI, it\u2019s really on us to make sure\u2013 So it\u2019s on your proprietary tools? It\u2019s on us that what our generative AI spits out is relevant to our customer in a way that some other provider with maybe a more general offer is not. We have to make sure that when we combine our proprietary journalism, our proprietary data, and our convening power with generative AI and LLMs, that the outcome to a query is A, reliable, and B, something that you can\u2019t find somewhere else or be at the scale of where you can find it somewhere else within that vertical. I think there\u2019s a distinction between establishing the principles and getting value for that, getting forward value if you are being used. Then, there is a separate category of efficiency tools that we use in the company. Yet, there\u2019s another category where we say, \u201cHere\u2019s where we build products that have to answer a certain question that exists in the market in any industry.\u201d We\u2019re going to give a superior answer, and you\u2019re going to need that answer in order to be more successful than the next person working on solving that problem in a certain industry. So, if that\u2019s about forecasting energy prices, we want to be the most reliable on that. We want to be the leading voice on what\u2019s happening in the chemical industry, and generative AI should be one way in which you get that out of us, but in a proprietary sense.  That should be, hopefully, very different from going to any chatbot and asking that same question. Maybe you get an approximation, but it might not be as reliable. Hopefully, there\u2019ll be sufficient proprietary data in our answer that will make that competition uneven to our advantage. That I think is the task. I feel very strongly that we cannot go into this new era with a view of, \u201cWell, this is what these companies have to do for us.\u201d We have to agree on the principles and the value, but then it\u2019s really up to us to create superb products and answers to complex questions in a very complex world, to realize the value that these new tools offer. Both those things have to exist. I\u2019ve talked to a lot of publishers and media CEOs over the past several years about where the traffic comes from, how the payments work, where the value is going. Setting aside AI for a minute, it feels like the nuclear question everyone is asking is if Google is just indexing our sites and taking the data, eventually we will have to block Google in a way that many publishers were comfortable using their robots.txt file to block OpenAI and other crawlers. Have you ever considered going that far? I\u2019m not going to speak specifically to Google. We\u2019re partners and we have lots of things that we do together. There\u2019s also things that we disagree on. News Corp has famously been the most outspoken on this. That\u2019s why I was comfortable asking the question. Absolutely. This is not on my radar in the way that you express that, but that\u2019s the short answer to that. Taking your question in a different way, we have to emphasize owned-and-operated. We have to make sure that being in our world \u2014 in our universe, in an individual vertical, in one of our broader products, or in the entire Rubik\u2019s Cube \u2014 you have an experience that you cannot have somewhere else. That\u2019s on us. How far do you go? It\u2019s about putting a wall around that. Yeah, we\u2019ll see over time. You are in litigation against Perplexity. It\u2019s taken some data. I\u2019m guessing by the fact that the lawsuit was filed, you didn\u2019t like that. If you win that case, The New York Times Company wins its case against OpenAI, or, I don\u2019t know, Sheryl Crow wins her case, that will upend the market as we understand it. There will be some new fair-use precedent that is created. How does that change how you think about building and deploying your own AI tools? Again, I put this in a separate box. We\u2019ve got to build our\u2013 Well wait, let me challenge you on that for one second, just to get it into the right framework. Right now, it feels like the entire industry is just assuming that, win or lose in these cases, the money will be sorted out and labeled to build at the same rate we\u2019ve been building. Maybe the rates go up, and it\u2019s just more expensive to do what OpenAI is doing because it has to pay all the singer-songwriters in the world. It also seems to me that potentially, the rates are so high that the entire structure of the industry changes. The industry, in this case, is AI. The AI industry changes. Suddenly, the compliance cost of making sure all of our data is licensed before we feed it into the model for training skyrockets because the penalties are high under copyright law. That feels like an under-considered risk. These lawsuits are just going to play out and something will happen. The way that I think Google was able to roll over the Viacom lawsuit when YouTube started or the Google Books lawsuit was because it was sort of the plucky upstart. The value of those tools was so high that it got to win a bunch of lawsuits. I don\u2019t think the AI companies feel like plucky upstarts. I don\u2019t think that public sentiment is with a bunch of giant tech company billionaires anymore. It feels like those lawsuits might go the other way. At that point, some of the tools you are using to build with or some of the partners you have, their cost structures might change so dramatically\u2013 That that is going to stop us from that development. That everyone\u2019s strategy has to change. I\u2019m just wondering how much you\u2019re considering that. I see where you\u2019re going with it. It\u2019s a little bit of the blind man and the elephant. There are different patches of fair use that different legal cases are pursuing. One case might reverberate, but it\u2019s not going to necessarily be absolute. I hate to say this as an answer to any question, but it\u2019s a big wait and see.  At the moment, I have to go on the assumption that as a technology, generative AI is present in my world, is going to be present even more, and is going to be an expectation from consumers, whether they\u2019re corporate or consumers out in the wild. So, we cannot continue to build and then think at the same time about how it may all just disappear. And by the way, we might be the culprit because we\u2019re applying that, which is... it\u2019s an interesting scenario. I don\u2019t think it will play out that way.  But you\u2019re one of the litigants. That\u2019s what I mean. It\u2019s interesting.  But I don\u2019t know that it will be debilitating. I don\u2019t think that the commercial agreement we have with OpenAI \u2014 with the value of which I can\u2019t say but you cited \u2014 has stopped it from developing. I believe in a market mechanism, and I think that\u2019s where we will end up, that there will be a gravitation to that rather than stopping the industry in its tracks. OpenAI famously has not made $1 in profit. It has to build a business that\u2019s valuable enough to support these deals.  Yeah, but Amazon didn\u2019t for a long time either. I feel like we\u2019ve brought up Jeff Bezos in a variety of ways on this episode. [Laughs] I\u2019m very curious to see how your lawsuit plays out with Perplexity and how those businesses develop. We\u2019ll have to have you back as that progresses. There\u2019s something there that feels almost invisible. You\u2019re right, the blind man and the elephant. It\u2019s there, it\u2019s very big, and I think this next year, we\u2019ll see how it shapes the business. I want to end by talking about press freedom. It\u2019s something you care about a lot, you\u2019ve talked about it a lot. You\u2019re a publisher of The Wall Street Journal. You famously had Evan Gershkovich detained in Russia in March 2023. You worked very hard across a number of administrations to bring him back. This is a very challenging time for press freedom, both abroad and it feels like in the United States. What\u2019s your view of the landscape right now? We live in a time of tremendous change, of polarization, and that makes covering the news trickier than ever before. It also, I think, increases the value and the contribution that we bring to society as a free press. With all the changes and challenges that we\u2019re seeing, including against the media, this is a time that any journalist should be made for. If your heart is in explaining complexity to the world, then there\u2019s never been a time when we\u2019ve had this to grapple with. On the one hand, we can offer enormous value, and on the other hand, it\u2019s become a lot harder to do that. The statistics around the world don\u2019t lie. There are well over 300 people who were killed last year doing journalism, and people being put in prison. There is a harsh dialogue in society that makes it, under many circumstances, less comfortable to go after a story. Sometimes I measure whether we did a story well by how much I got in terms of complaints from the left and the right after certain stories. So, the temperature is high. Let me push you on that too. That\u2019s an old chestnut in journalism, right? If everyone\u2019s unhappy, you\u2019re doing your job right. It\u2019s also my daily existence, honestly. So, it\u2019s a very young chestnut for me. It\u2019s there every day, but yes, I know where you want to go. This is a pretty asymmetric information landscape right now. One side is vastly more willing to lie. One side is vastly more willing to even change the data. The Trump administration is making noise that it\u2019ll take government spending out of GDP, which would dramatically change almost everything The Wall Street Journal does, right?  At the most fundamental level, we might not be able to trust government data anymore. That\u2019s a threat to press freedom, and it will spin it as a good thing. Elon Musk is out there trying to spin this as a good thing. You don\u2019t see the left playing that kind of game with the data to metaphysically create political outcomes. There\u2019s not as much trying to tweet things into reality that Elon is doing. I\u2019m not going to left-right things in this conversation. What I can say is how you respond to an information ecosystem, or maybe in an asymmetrical manner \u2014 I\u2019m saying, how do you respond to an information ecosystem where Donald Trump has threatened to sue pollsters in Iowa because he didn\u2019t like the results of their poll? Or where Brendan Carr, the Chairman of the FCC, is potentially holding up the CBS Skydance merger over his investigation of 60 Minutes\u2019 editorial content? There\u2019s a very clear answer to that. It\u2019s not an easy answer, but the first answer is stick to your principles. In our case, we believe in reporting the facts in the newsroom. We believe in free markets and free people on the opinion side. You stick to that and you do not let go. And you double down on that. That\u2019s our contribution to the information ecosystem, and we\u2019re going to do more of that.  That\u2019s a demand-driven thing as well, but we\u2019re talking about press freedom. This is an answer to that. If you start making concessions in your reporting and omitting facts that you know to be true or start self-censoring, then that game is lost. Second, you\u2019ve got to keep a cool head. We live in an environment where taunting and provocation is the norm. You can take that bait or you cannot. Then, you have to then, in my view, not be hysterical in response to every little provocation that might exist. In fact, you might get more respect if you do not respond to every provocation. Then, you have to recognize the moments when principles are at stake, when you have to fight or express your disagreement. So, keep on doing what you\u2019re doing. Do even more of it, in our case. Create reliable information. It\u2019s going to be good for society, it\u2019s going to be good for you as an organization. Keep a cool head and stick to your principles. That last part is also non-negotiable. All these three, in fact, are non-negotiable. You\u2019ve got to stick to your principles. If you start shifting and making certain concessions at the wrong moment, there will be a very high price to pay for that. You have colleagues in similar positions across the media that are making concessions. ABC settled its case with the Trump administration. Looks like CBS might settle the 60 Minutes case because the threat of the Skydance deal being blocked hangs over it in some way. Are you saying you would not make those concessions? Are you saying they should not? I am not saying either one of those because I\u2019m not commenting on their individual situations. I just think that there are moments where, as an organization, you\u2019re going to have to evaluate. The AP just went through this. Is this a moment where I speak out and where I stick to my guns or not? I think in those moments, you better choose carefully. You better have a clear view of your principles, understand what you actually stand for, and understand the ramifications. People will point back to certain moments, and you want to make sure that you were on the right side. I\u2019m going to ask you this more directly because I think I just need to hear it therapeutically, but I think your reporters probably need to hear it too. If the pressure comes to you from the Trump administration, are you saying that you\u2019ll fight when it feels like a lot of other big media companies are choosing to cave? The question is just too loaded, in that you make it very specific. We have fought for our principles for decades. We have stood up for our reporting for decades. We have a legal team that is incredibly strong, that has fought for press freedom and for our journalism again and again. If we make a mistake, we correct it. We own up to that. That is absolutely part of the value structure. We stand up for principles, period. What happens if the generative AI makes a mistake? It depends on what mistake it is. Actually, in building and co-creating some of these products that answer very narrow questions, we were sometimes surprised at mistakes that snuck in. We want to make sure we don\u2019t release products without having screened for that. But you\u2019re going to have to correct. Do you think that an information environment where some of the tools and the institutions are less reliable, or perhaps even openly hostile to the press, is something you will be able to chart as Dow Jones alone? Or do you think that\u2019s an industry-wide effort? Because it does not feel like there\u2019s a lot of coordination across the industry right now. I think the industry should shoulder a lot of this together in a loosely formed coalition or through solidarity. I\u2019m focused on Dow Jones\u2019 success, but I certainly share our findings with colleagues all the time, and there\u2019s a very active dialogue amongst media leaders that A, I want to foster and B, I want to participate in. If you look at very difficult moments like the Evan case or getting people out of Afghanistan during the U.S. forces\u2019 rapid withdrawal, we worked very, very closely together. There\u2019s very close contacts among a lot of those leaders. I think that\u2019s a healthy thing, and I would like to see more of it. Almar, you\u2019ve given us so much time. Tell us what\u2019s next for Dow Jones. Well, it\u2019s tomorrow\u2019s news, so I want you to tune in. Definitely come to The Wall Street Journal every day. For us, you\u2019ll see us focus on international rebalancing. We\u2019re rebalancing our portfolio to make sure that we are as strong outside the borders of the U.S. as we are here. We\u2019re focused on video, focused on deeper data products. Overall, we will continue to be focused on what we have been focused on for the entirety of our existence, and that\u2019s providing reliable information. Amazing.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":" Jasper Gilley San Francisco, California March 2025        Until this February, I had gainful employment at [redacted FAANG co] doing machine learning engineering for [redacted LLM-related job]. It was a great gig, and I enjoyed the work and my coworkers. However, taking a medium-term look at the market dynamics surrounding my employment prompted me to quit a few weeks ago. I'm now convinced that my former job there will be obsolete by the end of the year.       For context \u2014 I started my career as a backend engineer at a late-stage startup before transitioning into doing ML work for a few early-stage AI startups and finally for FAANGco. It's wild how much change the industry has already undergone since I started my career <5 years ago in 2021. My first job consisted of taking on atomic tasks in the form of Jira tickets that had been assigned points for difficulty and progressively knocking them out, sometimes in the form of pair programming with another engineer (gasp!) If this work model isn't obsolete yet, it certainly feels like a relic of a dying age. Frontier companies' cost per line of code must be approaching 10x cheaper than it was in these days. Most of the microservices repos at my first company could now probably be built in a day by one person with the aid of an advanced coding agent like Claude Code. It's not hard to imagine why the demand for junior devs has all but gone away when most backend work at these sorts of companies now consists of debugging thorny edge cases that only a senior+ level engineer is likely to be able to tackle.       ML work is different insofar as it requires cost management w.r.t. hardware that is nontrivially expensive, from the perspective of cost, availability, and execution time \u2014 even at hyperscalers. For a while, it seemed to me like the high cost of botched experiments would be a saving grace from automation in this field. AI slop code might be fine when it comes to the frontend of your Next.js side project, but when it makes false assumptions that cause silent errors in your training runs, you've got a problem.       This might continue to be the case for the foreseeable future to some extent, but there are two catches, from the perspective of an ML engineer who would like to keep their job:       A little while ago, I got the pervasive sense in the SF tech scene that as AI coding gets better, the place you want to be is in a rest-and-vest job with a publicly-traded FAANG company that will let you slowly automate your own job while you collect RSUs.       Sorry, the Efficient Market Hypothesis is more true than that.       Right now, most of your engineering job not spent in the IDE consists of writing\/clarifying specs, disambiguating them with stakeholders, and checking if things work as intended. These tasks are mostly beyond the capabilities of current models, less because they're fundamentally outside the scope of AI models' cognitive capabilities, and more because they involve navigating internal software, referencing documents, and being able to devise and run reasonable tests on the efficacy of a project, in the context of its desired purpose.       You don't have to extrapolate the capabilities of current computer-use agents very far at all to imagine them being able to autonomously do this sort of fairly menial context-gathering. As someone with a background in GUI agentsI worked on a startup in the field and consulted for another leading startup that you've definitely heard of, I'd be surprised if we don't have this capability by the end of 2025. At this point, it's about keeping relevant information in context, disregarding some of it when necessary, and knowing where to look to load it back. None of this seems prohibitive for a slightly more advanced version of current agent systems. This isn't even taking into account non-GUI-based tools for providing context to AI agents, like Anthropic's MCP, which could well further speed adoption and accuracy at companies that are on the frontier of these things.           As a sidenote, one of the key distinctions for agentic systems is whether you're telling them to use first-party or third-party software. Tasks like \"order me a sandwich on the UberEats website\" are fairly likely to get blocked by CAPTCHAs or other bot detection systems if you do them too much (I promise you, you can't fool profiling algorithms at scale unless you're a nation-state actor.) You yourself, however, can make sure that your bots don't get blocked from accessing internal documentation via approved channels. As a result, GUI agents might see much faster adoption for internal tasks than external ones.           All in all, I think the evidence points to a scenario where by the end of this year or next, engineering and other pure knowledge work IC jobs can be mostly done by AI agents, with some fraction of the people who formerly held those IC jobs acting as de facto product managers cum infrastructure janitors for agent swarms.       On one hand, this is great! We'll have essentially infinite working software at a price of \u2248$0\/line of code. The actual job of being an AI agent product manager cum infrastructure janitor, however, sounds awfully boring to me personally. That's why I quit my FAANG job a few weeks ago.       Contrary to what some tech people seem to think, there are factors of production other than intelligence. There may even be factors of production that are intrinsically tied to being a human, outside of the raw intelligence outputted by some people's brains. For the time being, those non-intelligence factors should retain economic value.       If you have a knowledge work IC job and are not interested in being an AI agent wrangler, where you go from here is obviously closely tied to your personal attributes and skills. To help get a clearer picture of what those are, I suggest talking to a language model. Specifically, I'd brainstorm jobs such that even if they could be done very well by AI systems, people wouldn't want to use AI systems to do them.       You always can stay on as an AI wrangler, of course. But for me, part of the appeal of getting into a profession like engineering was the intellectual challenge of using intelligence to solve problems, and it seems to be specifically the intelligence part of the job that's most directly in the line of fire for automation. Humans aren't defined by their intelligence, of course, but they're certainly not defined by their unique capacity to be infrastructure janitors for AI agents either.       Personally, I think some types of sales jobs fall under the category of \"even if they could be done by AI agents, nobody would want them to be.\" It's broadly in the rational economic interestsocial proof against scamming for the buyer; price discrimination for the seller of both buyer and seller that there be a human in the loop at this phase of the deal lifecycle. So the next step in my career is going to be talking to people about great AI products that are being built and helping them figure out if they'd find these products useful. If you're building a great product and would like somebody to tell people about it, please don't hesitate to reach outmy email is my name, Jasper Gilley, at gmail dot com, all lowercase!

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"Business Insider Edition  Welcome back! A product manager has some advice for junior employees: Be the dumbest person in the room. Asking questions and listening rather than trying to tout your knowledge is the best bet.          This will be my last edition for a bit, as I'll be on parental leave until May. But don't sweat it! You're in the very capable hands of my UK colleague Hallam Bullock while I am out. The only thing you'll need to change is to imagine a posh British accent while you're reading it.               In today's big story, people are getting worried about a potential recession. Here's how to protect yourself.       What's on deck   Markets: Find out what the PE giants are paying.       Tech: Everyone wants to get rid of low performers, but doing so might not be as beneficial as you think.       Business: Older Americans told us how they've traded in their white collars for blue ones to make ends meet.               But first, protect ya neck.       If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.   The economy might take a dive, but you don't have to let it take you down with it.           After a few months of everyone being excited about what the future could hold for the US economy, things have taken a noticeable turn. Scary words like \"recession\" and \"stagflation\" are getting thrown around, and the only thing that seems certain under the current administration is more uncertainty.               It's the kind of environment that can make your head spin. Lucky for you, we turned to the experts. Business Insider's Matthew Fox got advice from financial planners about what you can do to prepare for the worst. (And no, they're not just telling you to put your money in bonds.)               In fact, the best advice is more emotional than financial: Don't panic. When times get tough, people tend to want to react. But the reality is that markets move quickly, especially these days, and you don't want to get caught selling off assets amid what could just be a mini downturn.               Besides, if the economy does go south, you might be better off leaning into the chaos instead of pulling away. I am not a financial advisor, so don't take this as advice, but history has proven that those who were willing to buy the dips usually benefited in the long run.       But how did we get here in the first place?           Just a few months ago, things seemed ready to take off. The S&P 500 was setting record highs. Bankers were licking their chops at the potential deal flow. Everyone was ready to rock.               The market has been singing a different tune for the past few weeks.               Plenty of people are pointing their fingers at tariffs. Trump's will-he-won't-he trade plan has become a guessing game investors don't seem interested in playing anymore.               However, BI's Filip De Mott said that's not the only thing derailing stocks. The deregulation expected under Trump and his embrace of crypto haven't led to boons in industries just yet.               The key is that last bit: just yet. The administration has been in place for less than two months. A lot could still shake out. Investors' willingness to wait, though, remains to be seen.      Russia's arms exports are going bust as foreign buyers bolt and the Ukraine war chews through its weapons. 1. Private equity paydays. To get a pulse on how much people make in PE, BI combed through job listings and H-1B visa data for a dozen firms, including Blackstone, Apollo, and KKR. The good news: Salaries are steep, and an Odyssey Search Partners survey found bonuses can lead bigwigs to expect compensation upward of $1 million a year. The bad news: Pay growth has generally stabilized. 2. This tax season, don't bring the IRS to your door. While the IRS will often automatically correct small errors and typos, glaring mistakes can result in costly penalties. Avoid these four common IRS audit triggers for a smoother tax filing season. 3. The US government now has a bitcoin reserve. President Trump recently signed an executive order establishing a strategic bitcoin reserve, but, Peter Kafka writes, it's unclear what it's supposed to do and why the US should have one. The US already owns a bunch of bitcoin, and many crypto fans thought the Trump plan would be to go out and buy more. That doesn't appear to be the case now. 1. How parts of the US will track abortion pills. Last May, Louisiana reclassified misoprostol and mifepristone \u2014 both commonly used to induce abortions \u2014 as \"controlled substances,\" allowing prescriptions to be monitored. This designation is typically applied to drugs with a risk of abuse. Tech companies, like Bamboo Health, can make big money running states' prescription monitoring databases. BI found that, while designed to investigate doctors for wrongdoing, these programs can have wider implications for clinicians and their patients. 2. Agentic AI is coming to the military. Scale AI, the $13.8 billion startup helmed by Alexandr Wang, secured a DOD contract to integrate AI agents into military decision-making. The contract is the first of its kind and cements the partnership between tech and the military. 3. Actually, you need those low performers. Big Tech companies like Meta and Microsoft have instituted brutal performance-based cuts this year, making 2025 the de facto year of the low performer. But in reality, that management tactic hurts business in the long run. An initial surge in productivity is offset by loss of quality, morale, and, ultimately, profitability. 1. Another twist in the Baldoni-Lively saga. Three days before Justin Baldoni sued The New York Times, someone paid $120 to boost content about an emoji that was a key part of Baldoni's suit. The payment's timing suggests the client knew just how important that emoji would become before it was publicly revealed in the filing. 2. Federal workers clap back (subtly). Snarky emails, spoon emojis, and pronouns. These are some of the ways federal workers are subtly protesting workforce cuts and demands from President Trump, Elon Musk, and DOGE while also keeping their jobs. They told BI they've found comfort in banding together with their colleagues along the way. 3. Some older Americans turn to blue-collar jobs. Side hustles and blue-collar work have kept some former white-collar professionals afloat as they navigate the job market. BI heard from dozens of these older Americans who've struggled with landing roles after a layoff. Lower pay, a need for specialized qualifications, and rsum dilemmas are among the challenges. Trump handed these two Chinese e-commerce companies a double win \u2014 for now.  The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York. Grace Lett, editor, in Chicago.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"JBL is on a quest to build the perfect speaker. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an impossible quest, of course, but every iteration, it seems to inch ever closer to the finish line. Case in point, the JBL Flip 7. At first glance, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a run-of-the-mill speaker. But not only is it lighter than its predecessor, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more durable, with more powerful bass and redesigned tweeters. The result is a speaker that punches well above its weight class, pumping out loud, clear audio that rivals devices twice its price point. There are a couple of flies in the ointment, such as weak bass on some songs. And the speaker can move on its own when belting out the tunes if it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t positioned properly. But for the mid-tier price of $130, the JBL Flip 7 will be sitting on quite a few best Bluetooth speakers lists this year. You can pre-order the Flip 7 for $150 on JBL\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website with an expected ship date of April 6. The pricing is competitive and puts it in line with the Bose Soundlink Flex (2nd Gen) ($150), the Anker Soundcore Boom 2 ($130), and the Beats Pill ($130). JBL Flip 7 The JBL Flip 7 squeezes premium sound into a compact, durable shell Pros Cons Speakers like the Flip 7 are practically begging to be the star of your next picnic, beach romp, or cookout. To that end, JBL made the potent portable pretty darned tough. Not only is the Flip 7 waterproof (30 minutes in 1 meter [3 feet] of freshwater), the IP68 certified speaker is also dust and drop-proof (up to 1 meter on concrete or hardwood). That rating makes the Flip 7 one of the most durable portable speakers available, so you best believe it can withstand a few bruises and scrapes. When it launches, the Flip 7 will be available in six colorways (white, black, purple, camo, red, and blue). JBL sent us the white version of the speaker, which is a bit tame for my tastes, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll still look good no matter the setting. Most of the speaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s exterior is made of a grayish-white fabric that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 100% recycled. The plastic parts of the exterior and some of the speaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interior are made of 75% post-consumer recycled plastic. The Flip 7\u00e2\u0080\u0099s endcaps are silvery white with a metallic exclamation point in the center. The JBL logo is the only other metallic component on the speaker. The silver emblem, outlined in red, sits front and center, proudly on display. Buttons for volume and play\/pause sit at the top of the speaker, protruding ever so slightly out of the fabric lining. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a small console directly behind that holds the power, Bluetooth, and Auracast buttons. Look a little farther back on the speaker and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find the USB-C charging port next to the a gray lanyard that can be exchanged for a carabiner via JBL\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new PushLock system. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty straightforward. Just push and hold the gray button to release whatever is currently attached (in this case, the gray lanyard), slide whatever accessory you want in via the metal clasp, and release the button. I vigorously swung the speaker around with both the lanyard and the carabiner, and both held firm. I tossed the 19.68-pound, 7.2 x 2.7 x 2.6-inch Flip 7 into my bookbag, where it quickly became an afterthought. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s much lighter than the Boom 2 (11.7 x 7.3 x 3.95 inches) at 58.4 ounces, and The Pill (8.6 x 2.8 x 2.8 inches) and Soundlink Flex (2.1 H x 7.9 W x 3.56 inches) were also heavier, at 24 and 20.8 ounces, respectively. The Flip is only slightly heavier than its predecessor at 19.36 ounces, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also slightly bigger than the Flip 6, which measured \u00e2\u0080\u008b\u00e2\u0080\u008b7 x 2.6 x 2.8 inches. Any features the Flip 7 has are accessed via the free JBL Portable app. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s light on features compared to other companion apps. You get an equalizer with four presets, plus the ability to create your own sound with the custom option. JBL Portable is also where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll interact with PlaytimeBoost, a feature that extends the speaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s battery life by disabling the EQ while boosting volume. The Flip 7 is also one of the latest devices to tout Auracast technology, a new way to share audio across devices. Comprised of transmitters, receivers, and assistants, Auracast devices can share audio with an unlimited number of in-range compatible devices. Think of it like AM or FM radio, but for Bluetooth. With Auracast, the Flip 7 can connect with another Flip 7 to create a wider stereo soundstage with the PartyTogether feature. When the feature is simultaneously broadcasting a playlist to unlimited Auracast-enabled receivers. I discovered that you can do a bit of mix and match, as I successfully bridged the Flip 7 and Charge 6 using PartyTogether. Whatever you do, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t underestimate the power of this speaker. When the moment of truth came, and I cranked the Flip 7 to max volume and started streaming music, it knocked me for the proverbial loop. You really have to hear to believe the amount of knock this slim cylinder pumps out. JBL upgraded the bass and gave the tweeter dome a redesign that definitely make a difference. Combine that with AI Boost, JBL\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proprietary tech which the company says analyzes your music in real time to deliver the optimal performance with the least amount of distortion. I spent two hours listening to different genres of music (Hip-Hop, Rock, R&B, Country, Jazz, Alternative, etc.), and I have to say I was seriously impressed. It was fun watching the endcaps vibrate with all that air being pushed through bass radiators. Just be sure to position the speaker so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s standing on its tiny foot. Otherwise, all that vibration will move the speaker out of its original position. There were a few cases of mild distortion; the upper chords of Diane Krall\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Live cover of \u00e2\u0080\u009cFly Me To The Moon\u00e2\u0080\u009d was brighter than I like. And while you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll definitely get deep bass on most tracks, on songs like Kendrick Lamar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cSquabble Up,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the low end felt hollow. But man, nine times out of ten, the Flip 7 was on point with a generous soundstage with clean balanced audio. I felt like I was center stage partaking in Santana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s scintillating electric guitar as I listened to \u00e2\u0080\u009cEuropa (Earth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Song).\u00e2\u0080\u009d And while there is an electric guitar in Amethyst Kiah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cBlack Myself,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I had no problem hearing the twanging strings of the acoustic guitar. Another thing to note is the lack of a sweet spot. No matter where I positioned myself in my living room in relation to the Flip 7, there was never a point that I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t getting a full soundstage. And although the app offers several EQ presets, most listeners will be fine with the default JBL Signature setting. According to JBL, you can squeeze about 14 hours of music playback out of the Flip 7\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 4,800mAh battery. You can get an additional two hours of charge if you enable PlaytimeBoost. This feature boosts the volume but saves battery life by disabling the equalizer. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a cool feature for those looking to party until the cows come home. And for those looking to party right out the box, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be pleased to learn the Flip 7 shipped with 70% battery life. I streamed my main Spotify playlist, which has 335 hours and 42 minutes of music to the Flip 7 at 50% volume. The speaker lasted 13 hours and 29 minutes without the PlaytimeBoost enabled. You review enough products for enough years and you run the risk of becoming jaded. And then you come across something like the JBL Flip 7. At first glance, it looks like most portable Bluetooth speakers on the market. But look beyond its fabric shell and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a speaker that punches well above its price point. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of the most durable Bluetooth speakers on the market and uses a fair amount of sustainable materials. And while that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all well and dandy, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the sound that makes the Flip 7 a winner. Seriously, something this compact has no business delivering audio that full or loud. Sure, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll encounter a little distortion on some songs and weak bass. But with the redesigned tweeter domes, upgraded bass, and JBL\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proprietary AI Boost technology, those moments are few and far between. Instead, the Flip 7 produces a warm, vibrant audio with a generous soundstage with over 13 hours of battery life. And if you need even more party time, enable PlaytimeBoost to add two additional hours to ensure the party doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop until you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re good and ready. Overall, the JBL Flip 7 is a fantastic Bluetooth speaker that offers premium sound at a mid-tier price.  audioJBLportable speakers  \r           Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r          \r           News from the future, delivered to your present.\r          \r       Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r                 The JBL Charge 6 is built to bring the party, no matter the setting.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"The JBL Charge 6 has some big shoes to fill. Its predecessor, the Charge 5, consistently got high marks for its durability, utility, endurance, and of course, its audio performance. Thankfully, the Charge 6 has things well in hand. The speaker is currently one of the most durable Bluetooth speakers on the market. And as the name suggests, you can still top off your smartphone or tablet when its battery\u00e2\u0080\u0099s low. Speaking of battery, the Charge 6 now packs a full day of charge plus four hours with the Playtime Boost feature, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got fast charge. And with Auracast, the Charge 6 can share audio with an unlimited number of devices. And what about that audio? Accused in past iterations of being a bass monster, the Charge 6 takes a more measured approach to audio. Yes, the bass is definitely there, with the ability to send tiny little aural shivers down your spine. But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not so much that the mids and lows get lost. In fact, the Charge 6 presents a fairly balanced performance with a generous soundstage. Are there moments when there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little distortion? Sure, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re few and far between, which is impressive, especially for a speaker this size that only costs $200. In short, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a portable speaker that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s big on both sound and value, you owe it to yourself to check out the JBL Charge 6. JBL Charge 6 The JBL Charge 6 offers impressive audio performance with nearly 30 hours of battery life Pros Cons The Charge 6 is available for pre-order now on JBL\u00e2\u0080\u0099s website for $200 with a ship date of April 6. That price point puts the JBL on a par with the UE Megaboom 4 ($200) and the Sonos Roam 2 ($180). The Bose Soundlink Max is a pricier proposition at $400. With its handle attached, the Charge 6 looks like a funky purse, to the point where I can envision myself dressed to the nines carrying it as such. Just like its little brother, the Flip 7, the Charge 6 is an environmentally friendly piece of tech. The black fabric exterior is made from 100% recycled fabric, while the plastic throughout the device comprises 85% post-consumer recycled plastic. And with a durability rating of IP68, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of toughest S.O.B.s on the market. In addition to being water and dust proof, the speaker can withstand drops of up to 1 meter onto concrete or hardwood. Like its predecessors, the Charge 6 has the JBL logo prominently displayed on the front. Outlined in red, the lettering has an almost 3D-like effect. The speaker\u2019s endcaps are made of semi-transparent plastic with a big, honking exclamation mark. Just above the JBL logo are raised, hard plastic buttons for volume control and play\/pause with a small console for Auracast, power, and Bluetooth. The two divots flanking the buttons are a clear giveaway on where the strap is attached. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not going to lie, I was a little worried about the thin plastic strip holding the strap in place, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve shaken the bejesus out of this thing with no ill effects. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a USB-C port in the back that you can use to either charge the speaker or a device that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s running low on juice\u00e2\u0080\u0094hence the name. You can connect the Charge 6 to a laptop, smartphone, or tablet and get some Lossless audio going if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re an audiophile with discerning tastes. Finally, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pair of feet along the bottom to keep it from toppling over. Weighing 33.8 ounces, the 9 x 3.9 x 3.7-inch Charge 6 is a chunky thing. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not as hefty as the Soundlink Max (4.7 x 10.4 x 4.13 inches) which weighs 78.4 ounces. Still, the Megaboom 4 (8.4 x 2.4 x 2.4 inches) and Roam 2 (6.6 x 2.4 x 2.36 inches) are lighter at 32.98 and 15.2 ounces. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better than one speaker? Two speakers, of course. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got good news for those looking to expand their speaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s power. The Charge 6 can pair with another Charge 6 via the PartyTogether feature in the free JBL Portable app for some stereo action. And if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have another Charge 6, the technology should work with any PartyTogether-compatible JBL speakers. Plus, since this is an Auracast device, the Charge 6 can broadcast to an unlimited number of compatible devices, provided they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in range. Another prime feature the companion app offers is Playtime Boost, which disables the equalizer while boosting the volume. This results in approximately four additional hours of battery life, which comes in handy for those marathon session parties. And speaking of the EQ, there are four distinct equalizer settings in addition to a custom one you can tweak yourself. Of the options, most people will probably leave it on JBL Signature, which is the default setting. Cuteness aside, the Charge 6 isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to be taken lightly. JBL\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been tweaking with the formula, retooling the kit with some of \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe best engineers\u00e2\u0080\u009d in order to deliver the \u00e2\u0080\u009cmost realistic sound reproduction yet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The company also added its proprietary AI Boost tech, which delivers optimal audio performance with the least amount of distortion by analyzing your music in real time. I spent two hours streaming from my main Spotify playlist, swapping between a plethora of genres to get a real feel of the speaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s capabilities. And the Charge 6 did not disappoint. When I started streaming music to the Charge 6, a song came to mind, EnVogue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cGiving Him Something He Can Feel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d because JBL did exactly that. Whether I was listening to Janelle Monae\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cYoga,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cBring Me Joy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Layabouts and Portia Monique collab, or Durand Bernarr\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cImpact,\u00e2\u0080\u009d I felt that bass. The speaker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s powerful vibrations traveled through my desk into my hands and gently caressed my spine. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nice sensation. But in the midst of that, never did the lows get so aggressive that they submerged the rest of the track. On the contrary, in most cases the Charge 6 employs a nice, wide soundstage that allows just about every piece of a composition to do their thing. I had no problem hearing the tiny plosives from Alanis Morissette on the quieter parts of \u00e2\u0080\u009cIronic.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And Sleepy Brown\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hypnotic baritone seductively oozed from the speaker during \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh Ho Hum.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There were a couple of missteps, however.

It was a similar story with the background vocals on No Doubt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s classic \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpiderwebs.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Still, smaller audio points like claps, maracas, trilling keys, and snaps were fully present. I was pleased to see the Charge 6 shipped with 65% battery life. JBL estimates the Charge 6\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 4,722mAH battery can last a full day playing music. And if you throw in Playtime Boost, that time jumps to 28 hours, which is quite impressive. Without Playtime Boost enabled, I managed to run the Charge 6 down in 23 hours and 42 minutes at 50% volume. And when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to charge the speaker, it should only take three hours to achieve a full charge. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re strapped for time, 10 minutes will get you 150 minutes of music playback, give or take. The Charge 6 has that moniker for a reason. Because in addition to pumping out a tasty lick or two, the speaker can also charge a smartphone or tablet. Unfortunately, it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t top off your laptop. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a cool wishlist feature, especially for anyone who plans to tap into the Lossless audio feature when plugged in. As cute as the JBL Charge 6 is, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fault you for assuming it has subpar sound. I would, however, fault you for not going beyond your preconceived notions and taking a listen. Because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be missing out on one of the best Bluetooth speakers of the year. And friends don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let friends miss out on great tech. Hidden beneath that unassuming fabric shell are a powerful mix of woofers, tweeters, and traducers that manage to produce audio that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly clean, warm, and balanced. And yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u2018mostly,\u2019 because in a speaker this size, there are going to be some instances where the highs and mids might come in a little hot or the bass gets a little aggressive. But those moments are few and fleeting with the help of JBL\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AI Boost technology. And then you have ancillary features like Auracast that can turn the speaker into a broadcaster capable of sharing audio with an unlimited number of devices. And for those marathon listening sessions, the Charge can last for almost 30 hours and get right back to jamming with a 10-minute recharge. It can top off a device or two with its built-in powerbank. And when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to go outside, the Charge 6 is tough enough for a little misadventure. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for a portable Bluetooth speaker that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tough, powerful, and goes easy on your wallet, the JBL Charge 6 stands heads above the competition.  audioBluetooth SpeakersJBL  \r           Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.\r          \r           News from the future, delivered to your present.\r          \r       Please select your desired newsletters and submit your email to upgrade your inbox.\r                 The JBL Flip 7 punches way above its weight.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"Stock fell Monday morning amid growing concerns about U.S. economic growth. President Donald Trump declined to rule out a recession this year in an interview on Fox News, but said he expects a \u201cperiod\u201d of transition from the policy changes he\u2019s making. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 423 points, or 0.9% at about 10:35 a.m. in New York, while the S&P 500 dipped 2%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 3.2%. Last week was the stock market\u2019s worst in two years. The Magnificent 7 stocks were all lower Monday amid the economic anxiety, with Nvidia (NVDA+2.83%) stock down about 5%. Tesla (TSLA+5.27%) fell about 8.8%, erasing its post-election rally. Anthony Scaramucci predicted to Quartz that Trump will \u201cburn\u201d Elon Musk in six to eight months. Palantir (PLTR+3.02%) stock also declined. Stocks fell in Hong Kong on Monday after China said consumer prices fell in the January-February period, a sign of continued deflationary pressure. Here are some stocks to watch today: Airbnb (ABNB+1.53%) stock was upgraded to a buy at Jefferies, which cited the company\u2019s durable growth and its addition of an \u201cexperiences\u201d category. Bally\u2019s (BALY-2.02%) stock jumped more than 4% after the casino operator made an approximately $150 million recapitalization proposal for Star Entertainment, which would give it notes convertible into at least 50.1% of the Australian company\u2019s shares. Cognizant (CTSH+0.55%) Technology gained 2.5% on reports that activist investor Mantle Ridge had built a $1 billion stake in the technology services firm. Coinbase (COIN+5.55%) stock fell more than 10% after S&P Dow Jones Indices left the crypto exchange operator out of S&P 500 index, Bloomberg reported. Crowdstrike (CRWD+3.93%) stock sank more than 7%, extending the cybersecurity company\u2019s declines after it disclosed weak fiscal 2026 earnings expectations and sluggish revenue growth last week. All of the Big Four U.S. airlines are down. Their descent is led by Delta and United stocks, both of which plummeted about 8%. The airlines have fallen since mid-February on tariffs news, which may increase aircraft costs, and recession fears, which could affect travel budgets. Doordash (DASH+3.33%) gave up premarket gains to drop 3.8%. The delivery company\u2019s stock was included in the S&P 500 by S&P Dow Jones Indices. IBM (IBM+2.25%) shares gained about 1%. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to revive a $1.6 billion award against the company to KKR\u2019s BMC Software, Bloomberg reported. The justices didn\u2019t comment on the decision. Microchip Technology (MCHP+0.74%) stock fell nearly 11%. The company shed its February gains as part of a broader chip-sector selloff that\u2019s been exacerbated by the chipmaker\u2019s falling revenue and weak margins.  Oracle (ORCL+2.37%) will release its quarterly earnings after the market closes Monday. The software giant\u2019s performance will be closely watched for insights into its enterprise technology spending and cloud growth. Consensus estimates call for profit of $1.49 per share and revenue of $14.38 billion. The stock fell 4.6% in morning trading ahead of the report. Harri Weber contributed to this report.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"Business Insider Edition  Admittedly, I've never been a car person. If it was up to me, I'd still be driving the 1979 Monte Carlo I learned to drive in. That behemoth had a red-faded-to-pink interior, and I could easily cram all my friends and our cheerleading gear into the back.          But alas, I married a car guy. If he sees a car's headlights or taillights from a block away, he can name the make, model, and current value on the Kelley Blue Book.               He'd been dreaming of a Tesla for years since he took a road trip in a friend's Model S. \"It's so fast and sleek. And there's so much storage because there's no engine,\" he crooned. As Teslas became more popular, it became like our family's version of the Slug Bug game. \"There's a Tesla!\" our sons would cry from the back of our Nissan Pathfinder.               As more electric vehicles entered the market, we decided to join the club. So, my husband did what he does best \u2014 research. After considering Rivians and Polestars, he landed on the Tesla Model Y.               It had a decent range and a great charging infrastructure. Most of our driving was done in the city, but we did take occasional road trips to visit family in Iowa or up north for a family vacation. It also had the needed storage capacity for our family of four, our dog, and luggage for a week away. When we took our first test drive, I also fell in love with the Model Y.               The Tesla came with a learning curve. On our first longer trip, my husband and I experienced a tense 30 miles because we didn't stop to charge when the car told us to. We did the math and figured we could make it to our destination. We did make it\u2014 after we turned off the air conditioning and radio and slowed to 40 mph on the interstate to save battery. Luckily, our marriage survived. Needless to say, we always stopped to charge after that.               It also took some practice with one-pedal driving, but I soon loved it. I also enjoyed the acceleration in my Model Y, resulting in my first speeding ticket since 1999. I'm sure the bright red color made me an easy target.               While it was sometimes annoying to stop for a charge on a road trip, we got used to the slight inconvenience and used the time to go for a short walk, peruse strange convenience store wares, and play silly car games.               When we saw the final insurance quote, we thought there had to be a mistake. But no \u2014 it really was going to cost almost as much as our monthly grocery bill.               We knew our insurance premiums would be high because we have two young adult son drivers, but we had no idea adding a Tesla would be sell-a-kidney expensive.       Electric cars generally cost more to insure than gas vehicles, and Teslas have some of the highest premiums. With our current policy, the Tesla costs over $333 a month, while our gas-powered Audi costs half that.               We've since learned that Teslas are outrageously expensive to insure because they're costly to repair, and the company corners the market on parts. Because the repair process can take a long time, insurance companies are stuck footing the bill for longer-term rentals. We also learned that because Teslas drive so fast, their insurance risk rating is just below that of a performance vehicle.               Of course, we've also had several conversations about the\u00a0Musk controversy, but at the end of the day our pocketbook and family needs dictate the decision to sell our Tesla this spring.               These are all factors we had no idea we should consider before we made our purchase, but they are definitely on my husband's new list as he researches our next vehicle. Now we're in the market for a plug-in hybrid, as they are a fraction of the price to insure and offer many of the same environmental and cost benefits we enjoyed with our Tesla \u2014 especially since most of our driving is within a few miles of our city home.               I'm still not a car person. So while my husband dives into research on plug-in hybrids, I'll be here, hoping our next car is just as easy to drive, is cheap to insure, and \u2014 if I'm really lucky \u2014 comes in a color that doesn't result in a speeding ticket. I may never get my Monte Carlo back, but at least I'll be driving something that won't require us to take out a second mortgage just for insurance.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team , Contributor.  ADBE Stock   Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is set to report its earnings on Thursday, March 13, 2025. Investors are expected to closely monitor the company\u2019s AI advancements, which has been less than impressive thus far. Analysts predict earnings of $4.97 per share and sales of $5.66 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 11% and 9%, respectively. The company has $198 Bil in current market capitalization. Revenue over the last twelve months was $22 Bil, and it was operationally profitable with $7.7 Bil in operating profits and net income of $5.6 Bil. While a lot will depend on how results stack up against consensus and expectations, understanding historical patterns might just turn the odds in your favor if you are an event-driven trader. There are two ways to do that: understand the historical odds and position yourself prior to the earnings release, or look at the correlation between immediate and medium-term returns post earnings and position yourself accordingly after the earnings are released. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception.

ADBE 1D, 5D, and 21D returns post-earnings A relatively less risky strategy (though not useful if correlation is low) is to understand the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, find a pair that has highest correlation and execute the appropriate trade. For example, if 1D and 5D show the highest correlation, a trader can position themselves \"long\" for the next 5 days if 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. ADBE Correlation Between 1D, 5D and 21D Historical Returns Sometimes, peer performance can have influence on post-earnings stock-reaction. In fact, the pricing-in might begin before the earnings are announced. Here is some historical data on past post-earnings performance of Adobe stock compared with stock performance of peers that reported earnings just prior to Adobe.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team , Contributor.  AVGO Stock   Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) delivered an impressive 9% stock price gain following an upbeat quarterly performance reported on March 6. The company\u2019s performance was fueled by continued demand for its AI products. With the stock soaring 50% year-over-year and maintaining robust revenue growth averaging 24% over three years, Broadcom surely presents a compelling narrative. But, here\u2019s the thing, in a downturn, AVGO can lose \u2013 no \u2013 there is evidence, from as recent as in 2022, that AVGO stock lost as much as 36% of its value over a span of just a few quarters. Now, of course, individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio \u2013 and in this environment if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Separately, see How ADBE Stock Might React To Upcoming Earnings? While Broadcom's AI prospects remain promising, substantial macroeconomic headwinds warrant attention. Though inflation concerns have diminished, they haven't disappeared. The current administration's aggressive tariff and immigration policies have rekindled inflation anxieties, potentially signaling economic turbulence ahead. Risk Factors to Consider The heightened geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the new administration's bold policy initiatives presents additional challenges. With ongoing conflicts in Ukraine-Russia, trade uncertainties, and strained negotiations with long-standing allies including Canada, Mexico, and Europe, the risk landscape has grown increasingly complex. Concerning Performance Metrics Notably, AVGO stock has underperformed the benchmark S&P 500 index during the recent market downturns\u2014a critical consideration for investors evaluating their risk tolerance in today\u2019s volatile environment. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. Inflation Shock (2022) \u2022 AVGO stock fell 36.3% from a high of $67.09 on 4 January 2022 to $42.71 on 16 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 18 May 2023  \u2022 Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $250.00 on 16 December 2024 and currently trades at around $195 Covid Pandemic (2020) \u2022 AVGO stock fell 46.8% from a high of $31.57 on 19 February 2020 to $16.79 on 18 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500  \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 5 June 2020 In conclusion, while AVGO stock currently enjoys investor enthusiasm driven by significant AI sector expansion, it commands a premium valuation at 30x forward earnings. Consider that despite Broadcom\u2019s impressive 44% revenue surge last year, projections indicate a decelerating growth trajectory\u201421% this year followed by 15% next year.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy   \tMiles Klee   \tToday, Elon Musk\u2018s X feed offered the usual mix of paranoid politics, attacks on Democrats and government agencies, and content from accounts affiliated with President Donald Trump (who still prefers his own web platform, Truth Social). But mixed in were a number of posts about Tesla, the electric vehicle manufacturer that still counts him as CEO despite his seemingly full-time commitment to the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a task force firing thousands of government workers as it torches the administrative state.  \tMusk posted, for example, a TikTok of a man showing off the design and features of a Tesla Model Y. Before that, he amplified pro-Tesla comments from anti-LGBTQ+ activist Robby Starbuck and MAGA conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer. Over the weekend, he shared clip from a Tesla fan account of the prototype for the Cybercab, a two-seater robotaxi the company will allegedly be making by 2026. He also circulated a video taken by a customer in their new Cybertruck, writing, \u201cHeartfelt thanks to everyone supporting @Tesla, despite many attacks against our stores and offices.\u201d The comment referred to a scattered handful of fires at Tesla dealerships in recent days \u2014 some of them alleged or suspected arsons \u2014 as well as showrooms vandalized or damaged by gunfire.  \t           \tMusk\u2019s increased advertising might be thanks to Tesla\u2019s wobbly performance on Wall Street. The stock finally dropped into free fall today, plunging more than 15 percent to mark one of the company\u2019s worst trading days since it went public in 2010. The tumble erased the last vestiges of the rally Tesla enjoyed after Trump\u2019s election victory in November, when investors clearly felt that a company run by the president-elect\u2019s largest Super PAC donor was a smart bet. It has lost more than 50 percent of its value \u2014 the equivalent of some $800 billion \u2014 since cresting in mid-December.  \tA number of factors contributed to this reversal, including declines across the market and hints of a possible recession. Yet the Tesla brand has also become uniquely toxic since Musk swept into Washington, gave what was widely recognized as a Nazi salute at an inauguration event, and moved to eliminate entire federal offices at a stroke, all while continuing to spew far-right misinformation on X. Last month, the mounting backlash cohered into a formal protest campaign, Tesla Takedown, that is organizing regular demonstrations at Tesla centers around the world while encouraging a boycott and, of course, calling for the automaker\u2019s investors to sell their shares.  \t            \t \t\tEditor\u2019s picks \t \t            \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time\t\t \t               \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far\t\t \t               \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\t\t \t               \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 200 Greatest Singers of All Time\t\t \t         \tUnsurprisingly, Musk has disparaged Tesla Takedown as something astroturfed by wealthy liberals (and conflated the peaceful movement with attacks in which suspected arsonists threw Molotov cocktails at dealerships). On Saturday, he claimed without evidence on X that an \u201cinvestigation\u201d of some kind had revealed that wealthy philanthropists including George Soros, Reid Hoffman, and Leah Hunt-Hendrix were funding the groups behind Tesla protests through the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue. Aside from misrepresenting how ActBlue works \u2014 it doesn\u2019t fund anything but is rather a system through which donors can send money to Democratic political candidates and liberal organizations \u2014 Musk also pointed the finger at two more supposed financiers of Tesla Takedown, Herbert Sandler and Patricia Bauman, who died in 2019 and 2024, respectively.  \tHoffman pushed back against the unfounded accusation today on X. \u201cJust one more of Elon\u2019s false claims about me: I never funded anyone for Tesla protests,\u201d wrote the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn, who was an executive with Musk at PayPal in the early 2000s. \u201cI don\u2019t condone violence. But it\u2019s clear Americans are angry at him \u2014 it\u2019s easier to explain away their anger, than to accept that actions have consequences.\u201d Musk replied, \u201cDescribe your favorite island vacation,\u201d baselessly implying that Hoffman had visited the Caribbean private island of the late sex trafficker and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. While Hoffman was acquainted with Epstein, as many rich and powerful individuals were, there is nothing to suggest he was a client of Epstein\u2019s trafficking ring. He revealed in an interview last year that he had to hire security staff because of Musk\u2019s repeated insinuations to the contrary.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"Eli Lilly (LLY+2.04%) CEO David Ricks got a 10% raise in 2024, as a surge in demand for weigh-loss drugs has propelled the pharma giant into the most valuable pharmaceutical company in the world. Ricks\u2019 total compensation for 2024 reached $29.2 million, according to the company\u2019s latest proxy statement, up from $26.6 million in 2023. When he became CEO in 2017, Ricks\u2019 annual compensation started at $15.8 million. In that time, Eli Lilly has seen explosive growth, largely due to its blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound. Both drugs belong to GLP-1 class of treatments, made famous by rival Novo Nordisk\u2019s (NVO-2.46%) Ozempic. GLP-1s, or incretin medications, mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and curb appetite. Morgan Stanley (MS+1.94%) analysts anticipate the global market for these drugs will reach $105 billion by 2030. Mounjaro brought in $11.5 billion in sales in 2024, while Zepbound generated $4.9 billion in annual revenue. Overall, Eli Lilly\u2019s total sales for the year across all its drugs amounted to $45 billion. The company projects that sales in 2025 will reach between $58 billion and $61 billion. The company\u2019s strong performance has also boosted its stock price. Eli Lilly\u2019s stock has climbed 10% over the past 12 months to about $842 a share. Over the last five years, the company\u2019s stock has surged nearly 500% With a market cap of $754 billion, Eli Lilly is now the most valuable healthcare company in the world, ranking 12th overall. For comparison, the next closest healthcare companies are UnitedHealth Group (UNH+0.11%) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ-0.75%), with market caps of $448 billion and $406 billion, respectively.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"Home Blog                        10 Mar, 2025                    I have been a skeptic of some of the more breathless claims made for Generative AI since at least October 2023, when I participated in a panel organized by Syracuse University.  Specifically, I have been skeptical of claims that these technologies will dramatically increase labor productivity in most or all occupations. This is generally what is meant by those who see Generative AI as a 'first step' toward 'artificial general intelligence' and is implicit in claims that AI needs to be regulated to avoid mass labor market disruption. I believe we are very close to the peak of investor hype around Generative AI. At time of writing, NVIDIA's stock price is down around 20% for the year to date. If I could time further falls, I'd be trading on that knowledge instead of writing about it here. That said, I would be surprised if executives are giving \"AI strategy\" high priority in Q2 of 2026. A new narrative will be required to drive investment in tech. The Gartner Hype Cycle is a perennially relevant framework for understanding these narrative shifts. If we are entering the \"trough of disillusionment\", now would be a good time to ask what the \"plateau of productivity\" might look like. LLMs have made possible real process innovations. Software development and customer support services, for example, can be delivered somewhat more efficiently than they were before. Retrieval through LLM document embeddings, though no panacea, represents a genuine advance in search. In customer support, the early and often routine steps of a call tree can now be handled by chatbots in many instances, with only exceptional cases escalated to human agents. The chatbot is helping some fraction of customers help themselves by walking them through support documentation step by step. Some fraction of end users will find this frustrating, but if they aren't particularly wealthy, the new equilibrium could very well be a degraded customer experience. Those with the means will be able to purchase support services that let them skip the bots and get directly to human assistance. In my occupation of software development, querying ChatGPT and DeepSeek has largely replaced searching sites like StackOverflow. These chatbots generally save time with prompts like \"write a TypeScript type declaration for objects that look like this\", \"convert this function from Python to Javascript\", \"provide me with a list of the scientific names of bird species mentioned directly or indirectly in this essay\". Anecdotally, LLMs seem to be substituting for less experienced developers across the industry as a whole. While the job market for more experienced developers (5+ years) has slackened modestly compared to late-2019 due to higher interest rates, the job market for less experienced developers seems positively dire. We may look back in a decade and lament how self-serving and short-sighted employers stopped hiring less experienced workers, denied them the opportunity to learn by doing, and thereby limited the future supply of experience developers. I imagine the headaches for computer science educators are incredible, as LLMs have been trained on every problem set ever posted online. The release of DeepSeek just a few weeks ago threw into question how many GPUs would really be needed, in aggregate, to generate all the tokens for which there was effective demand. Those trying to rescue the investor narrative are appealing to Jevons' Paradox. Jevons observed that rising efficiency in the use of coal coincided with rising coal consumption; AI boosters argue that increasing LLM efficiency can just as well occur alongside rising LLM usage. Brynjolfsson has highlighted  software development as an occupation that may see increased demand for workers alongside rising (LLM-driven) labor productivity. But it seems to me that for customer support, for example, demand for low to medium quality chatbot support is fairly inelastic. One hopes the same is true for the \"AI Slop\" currently inundating social media feeds. The Dead Internet Theory holds that there are virtually no real human beings posting on social media anymore, having all been replaced by bots. This is a wild overstatement. But political influence and scam bots (handling the early intake phase of the scam) may turn out to be the sustainable killer application for this technology.","label":0}

Kevin was one of the smartest and most skilled civilian translators of complicated economic data for the general public.  He will be missed. I never found anyone like him on the internet.

One of his last postings: \u201cFading fast. Pneumonia worse. Ventilator next. Not looking good. Take care of Donald Trump for me.\u201d I guess now we will have to take care of Trump for him. Rick stryker, is the trump recession part of the plan?  Or is it simply an added bonus in his attempts to destroy America?  Just for the record, rick is a strong proponent of trump and his current actions and outcomes. He will defend trump unapologetically. Elon Musk today: \u201c10% of federal expenditures\u201d are due to people having fake Social Security numbers, claiming it is \u201chalf a trillion dollars.\u201d How is it that people say Musk is smart?  This doesn\u2019t even make sense. He keeps making up claims of massive fraud but so far hasn\u2019t documented a single case. He\u2019s learning from his boss. Also, federal government quasi-emoyees are not supervised by the SEC; Musk is basking in the glow. They have yet to show a single case of a >125 year old person getting a check.  Trump was bawling off large numbers of extremely old people listed in the social security databases \u2013 but never stated that those people have been receiving any money lately.  These computer \u201cgeniuses\u201d went in and found records of everybody that had ever been listed in social security since its beginning. Data from the NY Fed\u2019s survey of consumer expectations for February were released today: https:\/\/www.newyorkfed.org\/microeconomics\/sce#\/  As usual, there are some oddities. Income and spending expectations were modestly better than in January, on par with all of Q4. At the same time, debt delinquency expectations are the highest since 2020, expectation for higher unemployment jumped up and expectations for household finances deteriorated. So, earn and spend more, but worse employment and finances. Notably, the biggest rise in expectations for spending and income was among the least numerate respondents.  There\u2019s a particular oddity regarding expectations for the increase in government debt. Just about every category of respondent, by region, income and education, expects a slower pace of government debt growth than in January, and the average expectation fell to the lowest rate since mid-2017. (Where in the heck are these people getting their news?) The only group to anticipate higher debt in February than in recent months is those below the age of 40. The largest drop in expectations for debt increase was among less numerate respondents.  Expectations of higher unemployment in February were led by those under-40, the college educated, those earning above $100,000 and Westerners.  Inflation expectations edged up slightly, with the same groups who most anticipate higher unemployment also most expecting higher inflation. Apparently,  the stagflation story is getting traction in some quarters. My two cents: The groups which most expect worse spending, income, employment and inflation outcomes also tend to vote Democratic and to be employed as journalists. The NY Fed doesn\u2019t segregate by party affiliation, but we may be seeing another example of partisan bias in consumer expectations. Frankly, I\u2019d put my money on the views of the well-educated, more numerate respondents, though how those jejune under-40s got so clever I can\u2019t imagine. I think they are hearing that government is laying off people and presume that will reduce government spending and debt.  Sometimes the level of ignorance can be shocking for those of us who follow the news.   Salary cost for the 2 million federal employees are a minimal fraction of the total federal spending \u2013 so the \u201ccutting\u201d cost by firing people is just a cruel theater. What\u2019s curious about this picture?: https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/graph\/?g=1EmEp The VIX is moderately elevated, while corporate spreads are not. I admit to a bias in favor of fixed income metrics over equity metrics. With that on the table, let\u2019s continue.  Since the Covid oopsie, there has been a shift from higher spreads and lower VIX to lower spreads and higher VIX. For some reason, stock volatility has become more elevated, while other corporate risk metrics have not. Even so, moderately elevated VIX vs dead low corporate spreads is hard to explain.  Unledd maybe corporate cash is the explanation?: https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/graph\/?g=1EmFP I\u2019m not smart enough to know if the high level of corporate cash holdings explains the divergence between the VIX and corporate spreads, but I would point out that cash holdings are no longer rising.  Obviously, I\u2019m looking for triggers for a sudden increase in financial ickiness. That has been my professional bread and butter, and I can\u2019t help myself. Corporate cash is a buffer against a sudden market puke. Corporate cash seems to explain the divergence between equity and debt performance right now.  What\u2019s missing from this analysis? Small business is. Small business formation has been a major factor in economic performance in the Covid era: https:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/graph\/?g=1EmH6 A look at recent FOMC minutes or small business surveys shows that small businesses are suffering from a lack of access to credit. We know that households are facing difficulties in meeting financial requirements, and households have been a major source of funding for small business in the Covid era. If households cut back on spending and small business formation stalls, I doubt all that corporate cash will save us. \u201cPresident Donald Trump shared his intent to purchase a Tesla on Tuesday to support Elon Musk\u201d [He\u2019d better act soon because the price of steel and aluminum is going up fast..] Trump is buying a Pity Tesla. Residents of which state have bought more Teslas  than residents of any other state?  California, of course, 3X more than residents of Texas and Florida combined.

California, of course. Unless MAGAites suddenly  fall in love with electric vehicles, where might Tesla sales tank severely?  Anyone? Anyone? Bueller?  Musk? Donald? Uncertainty\u2026 perhaps. Or just basic pricing. From a month ago. https:\/\/www.axios.com\/2025\/02\/18\/stocks-overvalued-research Odd that you have commented here, when Menzie has already published a new post about the economic consequences of policy uncertainty, a post which makes obvious how policy uncertainty could lead to stock market decline. Stocks have been overvalued for some time. So tell us, why would investors change their minds now? As demonstrated in the featured study, uncertainty has real economic consequences. Uncertainty is elevated, suggesting rising economic risks, and stocks have fallen just as one would expect.  The Vix is absolutely correlated with stock performance \u2013 negatively correlated. The Vix is colloquially known as \u201cthe fear index\u201d. What is the most likely cause of fear among stock investors now which wasn\u2019t present 2 months ago? And let\u2019s not ignore the point of the study; uncertainty is associated with bad economic outcomes. Menzie has drawn a perfectly reasonable connection to stocks \u2013 which you seem to want to dismiss \u2013 but the risk to the economy isn\u2019t a matter of over-priced stocks. Inconvenient for your point, but let\u2019s not dodge the issue. So why, exactly, do you think uncertainty might not be to blame for the sharp drop in equity values? You think $4 trillion in value evaporated now, rather than 2 months ago, just at random? Or is this another of your efforts to defend the felon-in-chief? Your email address will not be published.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team , Contributor.  LONDON, ENGLAND - MARCH 28: The Enphase domestic home EV electric Vehicle charger company logo ... [+] branding is displayed during the Everything Electric London 2024 at ExCel on March 28, 2024 in London, England. (Photo by John Keeble\/Getty Images) Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) is a top provider of residential solar energy solutions. It uses microinverter technology for efficient energy conversion and delivers integrated solutions for solar power, storage, and EV charging. Enphase\u2019s advanced technology allows it to command a premium for its microinverters compared to traditional string inverters. Nonetheless, the company has been navigating a challenging rooftop solar market since interest rates increased in 2022.   What\u2019s More to Consider? With a market capitalization of $8 billion, Enphase has lost 15% of its value year-to-date. Investors should recognize the company\u2019s sensitivity to economic downturns, as seen during the 2020 Covid crisis when its stock dropped by approximately 60% in a few quarters. This history raises concerns that Enphase\u2019s current share price of around $60 could potentially fall below $40 if similar conditions recur. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Enphase\u2019s proprietary technology and dominant market position make it appealing, yet broad economic uncertainties in the U.S. present a significant risk for investors. What risk might that be? Clean energy stocks are experiencing uncertainty due to the possible repeal of Inflation Reduction Act incentives and inflation concerns stemming from Trump\u2019s tariff and tax cut policies, which add to the challenges posed by high interest rates. As explained in our macroeconomic analysis, these factors could potentially drive the U.S. economy into turbulence or even a recession. Economic challenges are further intensified by escalating geopolitical tensions, driven by the Trump administration\u2019s assertive foreign policy. Ongoing conflicts, such as the Ukraine-Russia situation, and increasingly uncertain trade relationships\u2014including renegotiations with traditional allies like Canada and Mexico\u2014create a complex and risky environment for investors. While investors hope for a soft landing in the U.S. economy, how severe could the impact be if another recession occurs? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash illustrates how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes. \u2022 ENPH stock dropped 20.4% from a high of $336.00 on 28 November 2022 to $267.38 on 28 December 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock has yet to return to its pre-Crisis high   \u2022 The stock has continued to decline since the end of 2022 and is currently trading at around $60 \u2022 ENPH stock declined 59.4% from a high of $59.09 on 23 February 2020 to $23.99 on 18 March 2020, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 11 May 2020 In summary, it does not help that Enphase\u2019s stock remains expensive; it trades at nearly 6 times last year\u2019s sales and close to 77 times last year\u2019s earnings. The company\u2019s financial performance was notably poor last year, with revenues dropping by 42% and earnings per share declining by 76% year-over-year. Given this slowdown in growth and broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself this question: do you want to hold onto your Enphase stock now, or will you panic and sell if it starts falling to $40, $30, or even lower levels? Holding onto a declining stock is never easy.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"The US stock market skidded last week over concerns about a potential recession \u2014 and it's making some investors consider China again. The change in tune comes on the back of a bull run in China's stock markets. The MSCI China Index is up 20% so far this year, marking the best start of the year in history for Chinese stocks. The strong gains come after several years of dismal performance. Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a Sunday note that global mutual funds \u2014 who are typically long-only investors \u2014 may \"rekindle their interest in and sponsorship for Chinese equities.\" Over the last three years, these investors largely sat out rallies and reduced their exposures. \"Our latest investor conversations suggest that global LO mandates have become more engaged in Chinese capital market transactions (IPOs and placements) of late, and are increasingly motivated to add to the public market given the recent weakness and volatility in the US stock market where their allocations are close to all-time highs,\" wrote Goldman Sachs' analysts. They wrote that investors are also considering Chinese stocks because of China's technological breakthroughs and reduced regulatory uncertainty. The analysts estimate markets could see $8 billion worth of net buying in Chinese equities if global mutual funds up their allocation to the asset class by just 1 percentage point. The MSCI China Index's gains have outperformed developed and emerging markets by well over 10%. Goldman Sachs is maintaining its overweight calls on China H-shares and A-shares \u2014 those listed in Hong Kong and on the mainland, respectively. However, the analysts wrote that they expect China's bull run to slow and profit-taking pressures to emerge as US-China geopolitical tensions continue. Goldman Sachs also repeated its stance that China's current market rally is different from a short-lived September surge in Chinese stocks that was driven by an aggressive stimulus blitz from Beijing. September's policy pivot reduced downside risks for stocks, but recent developments in China's tech space are a game-changer, the analysts wrote. The boost in Chinese tech stocks is thanks to the recent rise of DeepSeek, a Chinese startup that released a cost-competitive AI model. This development flipped the narrative for Chinese Big Tech stocks that were previously under pressure from a state-led crackdown. It suggests that Chinese tech may\u00a0present serious challenges to capital-intensive AI development that has long been dominated by Western firms. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index has surged about 32% so far this year. Stocks of tech giants Alibaba, Tencent, and Baidu have jumped 66%, 27%, and 12%, respectively. \"The latest technology breakthroughs are more micro- and innovation-driven in nature, and are beneficial to earnings as well as to valuations, which might give the recovery more staying power than those that were purely driven by liquidity and policy expectation repricing,\" the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team , Contributor.  POLAND - 2025\/01\/22: In this photo illustration, the AMD logo seen displayed on a smartphone. (Photo ... [+] Illustration by Mateusz Slodkowski\/SOPA Images\/LightRocket via Getty Images)   Question: How would you feel if you owned AMD stock and it fell by 60%, or even 80%, over the next few months? It sounds extreme, but it has happened before\u2014and it could happen again. This year, AMD has struggled, falling about 18% since January, whereas the S&P 500 has stayed almost flat. The stock has been hindered by weaker-than-expected growth in its AI accelerator business, the launch of China\u2019s new resource-light DeepSeek AI model\u2014which might reduce GPU demand\u2014and mounting macroeconomic concerns in the U.S. following President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff impositions. We believe that the stock could decline further to as low as $40 per share. Here is why investors should be concerned. The key point is that in an economic downturn, AMD stock could suffer significant losses. Evidence from as recently as 2022 shows that AMD stock lost over 60% of its value in just a few quarters. Could AMD\u2019s roughly $100 stock drop to about $40 if a repeat of 2022 occurs? Of course, individual stocks tend to be more volatile than a diversified portfolio. In such an environment, if you are seeking upside with less volatility than holding a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns of over 91% since its inception. Although the generative AI wave has led to a surge in GPU demand, AMD\u2019s AI accelerator business has not performed as well as anticipated. In Q4, AMD\u2019s data center revenue\u2014a proxy for its AI chip sales\u2014reached $3.9 billion, falling short of consensus estimates. Furthermore, guidance appears weak, as the company indicated that data center sales for the current quarter are expected to decline by 7% sequentially. There are also concerns about the broader AI market, as companies may become more cost-conscious after years of excessive investment in AI infrastructure. The introduction of the DeepSeek AI model reduces the computing capacity required by generative AI models. Since DeepSeek\u2019s model is open source, many large tech companies might adopt its methods to reduce costs. If widely adopted, this could temper the demand for AI computing power, potentially affecting GPU demand. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war could also adversely affect companies like AMD. The Trump administration doubled the tariff on Chinese goods from 10% to 20% on top of existing levies. Last month, President Trump also hinted at the possibility of imposing a tariff of 25% or more on all semiconductor chips imported into the United States. Currently, AMD outsources most of its chip fabrication to Taiwan\u2019s TSMC, and import tariffs could increase the cost of its products. AMD maintained gross margins of about 49% over the past year, indicating that the cost of its products\u2014most of which are likely imported\u2014exceeds 50%. In contrast, rival Nvidia reported an adjusted gross margin of approximately 75.5%, suggesting that the cost of its imported products is likely below 25% of its revenues. This implies that tariffs could more significantly impact AMD, forcing the company either to absorb the extra costs\u2014thereby reducing margins\u2014or pass them on to customers, risking a decline in volume. Trump\u2019s bold actions on tariffs and immigration have also sparked concerns about a potential resurgence of inflation. All of these factors suggest that the U.S. economy could face significant challenges, and potentially even a recession\u2014our analysis here on the macro picture. Considering the heightened geopolitical uncertainty resulting from the new Trump administration's bold actions, these risks are critical. After all, the Ukraine-Russia war continues, and trade remains uncertain. Tariffs increase import costs, typically leading to higher prices, reduced disposable income, and lower consumer spending. This scenario could negatively affect AMD\u2019s core CPU business, as PC and laptop customers might postpone purchases, thereby diminishing chip demand. During some recent downturns, AMD stock has underperformed compared to the benchmark S&P 500 index. Are you concerned about the impact of a market crash on AMD stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Advanced Micro Devices Stock Go In A Market Crash? offers a detailed analysis of the stock's performance during and after previous market crashes. \u2022 AMD stock declined by 62.8% from a high of $150.24 on 3 January 2022 to $55.94 on 16 October 2022, compared to a 25.4% peak-to-trough decline for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peak by 16 January 2024   \u2022 Since then, the stock rose to a high of $211.38 on 7 March 2024 and currently trades at approximately $100 \u2022 AMD stock declined by 34.3% from a high of $58.90 on 19 February 2020 to $38.71 on 16 March 2020, compared to a 33.9% peak-to-trough decline for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peak by 22 July 2020 \u2022 AMD stock declined by 87.6% from a high of $14.55 on 18 October 2007 to $1.80 on 25 November 2008, compared to a 56.8% peak-to-trough decline for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-crisis peak by 27 February 2017 But given its extremely high valuation, the stock appears relatively expensive, which supports our conclusion that AMD is an expensive stock to buy. In summary, it does not help that AMD stock remains expensive, trading at nearly 30 times trailing earnings. Certainly, Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 Revenues have grown significantly in recent years, increasing at an average rate of 17.8% over the past 3 years (compared to 9.8% for the S&P 500). However, this growth could quickly diminish if the economy deteriorates and tariffs are imposed on AMD\u2019s products. Given the slowdown in growth and broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself the question: do you want to hold on to your AMD stock now, or will you panic and sell if it falls to $50, $40, or even lower levels? Holding on to a declining stock is never easy.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":" \t\t\t\t\t\t\tBy   \tNikki McCann Ramirez   \tStock markets continued their downward slide today amid growing concerns that President Donald Trump\u2019s economic shock doctrine will trigger a major economic downturn. The \u201cgolden age\u201d of economic prosperity he promised during his 2024 campaign doesn\u2019t seem to be coming anytime soon, and just weeks into his term, Trump is scrambling to make excuses for an increasingly grim economic forecast.\u00a0  \tDuring his first term in office, and throughout his reelection campaign, the president regularly claimed that upward trends in major stock markets were a reflection of his economic and political genius. Downward slides were inevitably his opponents\u2019 fault. On Friday, however, he blamed shady \u201cglobalists\u201d for cratering markets. On Sunday, during a discussion of the potential fallout of his trade war against Canada, Mexico, and China, the president told Fox News that, in fact, Americans shouldn\u2019t \u201creally watch the stock market.\u201d\u00a0  \t\u201cIf you look at China, they have a 100-year perspective,\u201d Trump added. \u201cWe go by quarters. And you can\u2019t go by that.\u201d  \t           \tWhen asked directly by host Maria Bartiromo if he was bracing for a recessionary economy, Trump claimed that while he \u201chates to predict things like that \u2026 there is a period of transition, because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We\u2019re bringing wealth back to America.\u201d  \tWhen asked a similar question on Air Force One later that afternoon, Trump reverted to the scammy get-rich-quick promises of his campaign. \u201cAll I know is this, we\u2019re going to take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs, and we\u2019re going to become so rich you\u2019re not going to know when to spend all that money,\u201d he told reporters.  \tWhen asked what he had to say to Americans who were seeing their retirement investments fall in the past few weeks, the president replied that \u201cthe tariffs are going to be the greatest thing we\u2019ve done as a country.\u201d\u00a0  \t\u201cIt\u2019s going to make our country rich again,\u201d he added.\u00a0  \tBut before those piles of cash materialize, Trump and his closest economic advisers are conceding that Americans will suffer.      \t \t\tEditor\u2019s picks \t \t            \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time\t\t \t               \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far\t\t \t               \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\t\t \t               \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tThe 200 Greatest Singers of All Time\t\t \t         \tEarlier this month, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick acknowledged that \u201cthere is going to be a short period of time where there will be some higher prices on certain products,\u201d but claimed that it \u201cis not inflation, that\u2019s nonsense.\u201d Last week, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the tariffs by telling the Economic Club of New York that \u201caccess to cheap goods is not the essence of the American dream.\u201d Bessent previously used the same term Trump did \u2014 warning of a \u201ctransition\u201d period \u2014 to discuss the possibility of a recession economy. Trump, meanwhile, has on multiple occasions, including during his address to Congress last week, said Americans will experience an economic \u201cdisturbance\u201d or \u201cdisruption\u201d as a result of his tariff plan.  \t           \tEconomists have warned that Trump\u2019s trade war and tariff obsession will likely lead to sharp increases in costs for consumers, supply chain disruptions, and slowed GDP growth.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team , Contributor.  ABBV Stock   AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) stock has demonstrated remarkable resilience in 2025, posting a 22% gain while the S&P 500 has declined 2%. As ongoing trade tensions fuel concerns about economic stability, investors are increasingly gravitating toward defensive sectors, particularly pharmaceuticals, with the S&P Healthcare index climbing 8% year-to-date. The market\u2019s confidence in AbbVie stems primarily from exceptional growth in its immunology portfolio, specifically Skyrizi and Rinvoq. The company\u2019s impressive Q4 performance has further bolstered investor sentiment. Additionally, AbbVie has now positioned itself in the high-growth obesity treatment market through a recently announced licensing partnership with Gubra. After its recent rise, ABBV stock looks relatively expensive - making it an expensive pick to buy at its current price of around $215. We believe there are some minor concerns with ABBV stock, which makes it relatively expensive given that its current valuation looks very high.    We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of ABBV stock with its operating performance over the recent years, as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of AbbVie along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see How ADBE Stock Might React To Upcoming Earnings? Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, ABBV stock looks expensive compared to the broader market. \u2022 AbbVie has a price-to-sales (P\/S) ratio of 6.6 vs. a figure of 3.2 for the S&P 500   \u2022 Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P\/EBIT) ratio is 31.1 compared to 24.3 for S&P 500   \u2022 And, it has a price-to-earnings (P\/E) ratio of 19.7 vs. the benchmark's 24.3 AbbVie's Revenues have grown marginally over recent years. \u2022 AbbVie has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 0.2% over the last 3 years (vs. increase of 6.9% for S&P 500)   \u2022 Its revenues have grown 3.7% from $54 Bil to $56 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. growth of 5.2% for S&P 500)   \u2022 Also, its quarterly revenues grew 5.6% to $15 Bil in the most recent quarter from $14 Bil a year ago (vs. 5.0% improvement for S&P 500) AbbVie's profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. \u2022 AbbVie's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $12 Bil, which represents a high Operating Margin of 21.1% (vs. 13.0% for S&P 500)   \u2022 AbbVie\u2019s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $19 Bil, pointing to a high OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 33.4% (vs. 15.7% for S&P 500) AbbVie's balance sheet looks fine. \u2022 AbbVie's Debt figure was $67 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $379 Bil (as of 3\/7\/2025). This implies a strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 18.2% (vs. 19.0% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable]   \u2022 Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $5.6 Bil of the $135 Bil in Total Assets for AbbVie. This yields a poor Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 4.1% (vs. 14.8% for S&P 500) ABBV stock has seen an impact that was slightly better than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. \u2022 ABBV stock fell 23.3% from a high of $174.96 on 10 April 2022 to $134.21 on 2 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 7 February 2024   \u2022 Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $214.29 on 9 March 2025  \u2022 ABBV stock fell 32.1% from a high of $94.96 on 23 February 2020 to $64.50 on 23 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500   \u2022 The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 9 June 2020  In summary, AbbVie's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: \u2022 Growth: Neutral   \u2022 Profitability: Very Strong   \u2022 Financial Stability: Neutral   \u2022 Downturn Resilience: Neutral   \u2022 Overall: Neutral But given its very high valuation, the stock appears relatively expensive, which supports our conclusion that ABBV is an expensive stock to buy. The rich valuation of ABBV stock limits its upside potential in the near-to-mid term. As an alternative, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that?

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"The leader of Ontario, Canada, made good on his threats to slap a 25% tariff on electricity sent to neighboring U.S. states on Monday. The tariffs are a direct response to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs against Canada, a form of economic coercion with the goal of making Canada a state or territory of the United States. The announcement of the 25% tariff on electricity to the U.S. was made by Ontario\u2019s premier, Doug Ford, and energy minister, Stephen Lecce, at a press conference Monday. The electricity being imported to the U.S. primarily goes to three states: New York, Michigan, and Minnesota, though customers in other neighboring states like Wisconsin will also feel the impact. At least 1.5 million Americans will see the price hike, according to Canada\u2019s CBC. The new tariff will add about $10 per megawatt-hour to electricity heading from Canada to the U.S., generating about $300,000 to $400,000 per day in extra revenue, according to the CBC. That money will be used to support businesses negatively affected by American tariffs imposed by Trump. President Trump has flip-flopped on tariffs against not just Canada but also other countries like Mexico in recent weeks. Last week, Trump \u201cpaused\u201d a portion of the 25% tariffs he had announced for Canada, setting a new deadline of April 2, but Canada said it would not pause its own retaliatory tariffs until Trump dropped them entirely. \u201cUntil these tariffs are off the table, until the threat of tariffs is gone for good, Ontario will not relent,\u201d Ford said Monday. \u201cWe will not back down, pausing some tariffs, making last minute exemptions, it won\u2019t cut it. We need to end the chaos once and for all. We need to sit down, work together, and land a fair deal.\u201d Initially, Trump said the tariffs were needed because Canada allowed fentanyl to be trafficked into the U.S., an absurd pretext for Trump\u2019s goal of harming Canada economically in order to annex the nation. Less than 1% of fentanyl coming into the U.S. comes from Canada. But the flimsy pretext was needed to create a national security justification for the tariffs, the only way to violate the United States\u00e2\u0080\u0093Mexico\u00e2\u0080\u0093Canada Agreement (USMCA) with some thin veneer of legality. Trump himself negotiated the USMCA, which was just a replacement for the free trade agreement known as NAFTA, first agreed to in the 1990s by President Bill Clinton. But Trump has said the USMCA allows Canada and Mexico to \u201ctake advantage\u201d of the U.S., an absurd argument that simply makes no sense. The press conference Monday by Ford and his energy minister Lecce addressed the possible repercussions for the Canadian economy. Lecce said they don\u2019t need to worry about retaliation from the U.S. because Ontario has agreements with the province of Quebec that allow them to ramp up capacity during the hot days of summer without relying too much on U.S. electricity imports. Ford noted that even if Trump somehow was successful in getting businesses to relocate from Canada to the U.S., America simply doesn\u2019t have enough workers to fill the positions. The premier said he\u2019d sat down with car manufacturers in particular who said that even if they wanted to move everything they had from Canada to the U.S., they couldn\u2019t do it for lack of available employees. Ford is a conservative who previously appeared to be an ally of Trump, which has turned him into an unlikely adversary of the American president\u2019s policies. But Canadians have been understandably upset with Trump\u2019s threats against their country, leading to a slew of actions that appear to befuddle some Americans. Canadians have been booing the U.S. national anthem at sporting events, and a nationwide boycott of American products has led to viral videos showing products like Lay\u2019s potato chips sitting unsold in grocery stores in the country, despite being heavily discounted. American booze has also been taken off the shelves in some provinces, something American alcohol producers have protested. Even if tariffs raise prices, those producers can still make money, though less, thanks to the tariffs. If the product isn\u2019t even available to purchase, they make no money. Ford noted that he has been talking with Republicans in the U.S. who really don\u2019t like how Trump is harming American business right now. \u201cI talked to a tremendous amount of Americans,\u201d Ford said at the press conference. \u201cThey totally disagree with what President Trump is doing. Stanch Republican Trump supporters totally disagreeing with President Trump on this policy. So I think we have a strong relationship. It goes back over 200 years.\u201d Ford also mentioned that Trump is hurting the stock market, which has plunged in recent weeks over the uncertainty and chaos introduced by the president. Asked by a reporter Monday what he would say to President Trump, Ford implored him to look at what\u2019s happening to the stock market. \u201cI would say, you know, one of his measuring sticks are the markets,\u201d Ford said. \u201cThe markets have dropped trillions of dollars. He has to understand. He\u2019s a smart guy. He may like them or dislike them, but make no mistake. He understands the markets.\u201d Ford may be trying to stroke Trump\u2019s ego, but there\u2019s no real evidence the president is a smart guy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 480 points for the day at the time of this writing. And there are indications that Trump and his goons may be trying to intentionally harm the U.S. economy to suppress wages and buy up assets for cheap in an economic downturn. Trump was asked by Fox Business over the weekend if he could rule out a recession, and he made no promises, calling this a \u201ctransition\u201d period. BARTIROMO: Are you expecting a recession this year? TRUMP: I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition. [image or embed] \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com) March 9, 2025 at 7:12 AM  The Canadians are taking this seriously, just as they should. President Trump has made it clear he\u2019s an imperialist threat to liberal democracies around the world. And he\u2019s not just \u201cjoking\u201d as some apologists often said shortly after the November election, when Trump first floated the idea of invading Panama, annexing Greenland, and making Canada the 51st state. As it happens, Trump has made no such \u201cjokes\u201d against authoritarian countries like Russia. In fact, he\u2019s cozied up to America\u2019s former geopolitical adversaries while threatening some of this country\u2019s best friends. Trump is a threat to the safety and security of not just Americans but every country of free people around the world.

This stock is likely to outperform the technology index. This cycle points to a low now. Microsoft cycles are strong until June, but underperformance is likely in the second half of the year. The first half of any year has been bullish. Over the last 38 years, the stock has risen 74% of the time. The cycle is the weakest of the stocks that are under review in the second half of 2025, projecting a weak close to 2025. This cycle advises us to sell in May.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"ByCatherine Brock  ByCatherine Brock , Contributor.  To choose the right AI stock for your portfolio, identify a business model you understand and ... [+] confirm the company has the cash flow, value proposition and leadership skill to navigate uncertain economic conditions. AI stocks are still having a moment, even with some volatility in play. Here's a look at the five best-performing AI stocks over the last 12 months. Will one of these fit well in your portfolio? Read on to find out. The stock market has been volatile in 2025. Uncertainty about tariffs and federal budget cuts are driving broad instability in stock prices. AI stocks have been especially reactive. Many AI stocks have high valuations, as investors set prices based on growth prospects rather than past performance. When data suggests the growth outlook has changed, investors react. Stock prices will rise or fall quickly as a result. You can see the reactivity by tracking an AI ETF like Invesco's AI and Next Gen Software ETF (IGPT). In 2024, IGPT grew as much as 28% before dipping and ending the year with an 11% gain. So far in 2025, the ETF is down 6%. By comparison, the S&P 500 is down 2.3% for the year. These best AI stocks were chosen by screening on stock price growth over the past year. The stocks with the largest one-year growth percentages and market capitalizations above $2 billion were selected. The table below includes five best-performing AI stocks, with their market capitalizations and one-year growth trends. For more investing ideas, see best stocks for 2025. Palantir makes AI-enabled software for counterterrorism, manufacturing efficiency, software management and data analytics. The company serves commercial and government customers. The government business drives more revenue, but the commercial revenue grew faster in 2024. Palantir is at the forefront of the AI revolution. The company\u2019s software promises to unlock valuable data insights for efficiency and better decision-making, potentially reshaping how businesses and agencies operate. The stock price has increased more than 200% to the low-$80s in the last 12 months. This includes a February pullback from $125 when investors got nervous about Palantir\u2019s high valuation in light of planned government spending cuts. The current price point may signal a buying opportunity for AI investors. The company is profitable and growing. Revenue grew 38% in 2024 to $1.9 billion, with double-digit gains in commercial and government sales. The company expects 31% revenue growth this year as well. Palantir is also flush with cash, holding some $5.2 billion in cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. Upstart operates an AI lending platform that uses machine learning models to evaluate credit risk. The company says its solution is more accurate than legacy, credit-score models. Upstart helps its financial clients approve more loans with lower APRs. According to company data, lenders can approve 101% more applications and deliver 38% lower APRs using Upstart versus a traditional credit evaluation. UPST stock\u2019s trajectory has been like PLTR's. The USPT stock price is more than 100% in the last 12 months, after a decline that began in February. The downturn followed three analyst price target increases and a positive EPS surprise\u2014indicating investors are concerned about the economy, rather than Upstart specifically. Upstart grew 2024 revenues 24% and halved its net loss. Income from operations was negative last year, but adjusted EBITDA was a positive $10.6 million. The company has $368 million in cash and a high debt-to-equity ratio of 2.45. Twilio offers technology solutions supporting personalized customer communications. Using Twilio's platform, marketers can use data and customer actions to authenticate users and trigger tailored text messages and emails. Twilio has been in the personalized communications space for years. In 2024, the company enhanced its AI functionality with support for developing customer-facing AI assistants. Twilio\u2019s AI Assistants can connect to nearly any data source and integrate with Twilio voice and text campaigns. Twilio\u2019s move into AI has driven big stock price gains. TWLO is up nearly 74% over the last 12 months. The company also got caught in the technology sell-off last month\u2014in early February, the stock price was nearly $40 higher than now. Twilio did miss the consensus EPS target for the fourth quarter by $0.03, but the miss was followed by at least three analyst price target increases. Twilio increased 2024 reported revenues by 7% and shrank its GAAP operating loss to $53.7 million from $876.5 million in the prior year. The company has about $2.3 billion in cash and short-term marketable securities on its balance sheet and maintains a low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.14%. SoundHound provides AI-enabled voice solutions that power automated customer-facing agents. Products include voice assistant, AI chat solutions and generative voice AI for drive-thru ordering. SoundHound works in agentic AI, a segment predicted to be worth $196.6 billion by 2034. The company says its patented technology comprehends speech faster and provides more accurate responses than other solutions. The technology can potentially reshape industries that rely on direct conversations with customers, including fast food and hospitality. SoundHound stock has grown about 73% over the last 12 months. The stock price peaked in December just short of $25, before moderating back to about $15 in February and $9.74 in March. The company's 2024 results, announced in late-February, contributed to the weaker stock price in March. Revenues grew 85% but the GAAP loss per share widened to $0.69 from $0.07. At year-end, SoundHound had no debt and nearly $200 million in cash on hand. SAP makes enterprise resource planning (ERP) software. Businesses use ERP to manage critical processes in marketing, finance, procurement and more. SAP has the second-highest market share in ERP, behind Microsoft. SAP incorporates AI functionality into its applications and its Business Technology Platform (BTP). BTP is a comprehensive cloud-based solution supporting data storage and management, AI, analytics, application development and automation. SAP customers can leverage AI capabilities using their business data rather than dated training data. Nvidia and other hardware providers led the first wave of AI investing as enterprises spent billions building and expanding data centers. As reported by Investors.com, a Goldman Sachs analysis predicts software companies will be next to monetize the AI revolution. Business decision-makers will invest in AI if it can save money and improve marketing effectiveness. Software providers that deliver these outcomes are the ones that will prevail. Examples include: Several AI stocks saw a pullback in February, which could signal a buying opportunity. Software providers are particularly attractive because they can provide real business value to their customers. Solutions that offer solid returns will grow the quickest. AI companies with the cash and leadership savvy to manage growth effectively will pay their shareholders handsomely in stock price gains. Bottom Line AI stocks are high-risk, high-reward securities. To choose the right one for your portfolio, identify a business model you understand and confirm the company has the cash flow, value proposition and leadership skill to navigate uncertain economic conditions. If the valuation is acceptable, begin with a small position and increase it as you gain confidence investing in this space. In terms of stock price growth, Palantir Technologies was one of the best-performing AI stocks of 2024. PLTR grew 349.51% in the year, from about $16.95 in January to nearly $80 by December.\u00a0 Some, but not all, AI stocks have high valuations. Palantir Technologies, for example, has a PEG ratio over 6. A PEG ratio higher than 1 can indicate overvaluation.\u00a0 You can invest in AI without picking individual stocks by choosing an AI-themed ETF instead. Options include Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (AIQ) and First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence & Robotics ETF (ROBT).\u00a0 Health care, finance, retail, manufacturing and transportation can benefit from AI. These industries use AI technologies to improve strategic decision-making, enhance efficiencies and gain more customers.\u00a0","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":" India\u2019s electric two-wheeler market has been growing exponentially, driven by rising fuel costs, environmental concerns, and government incentives. Brands like Ola, Ather, and TVS have been at the forefront of the e-scooter wave, but Ultraviolette\u2014the company that gave India its first electric superbike, the F77\u2014is stepping in to redefine the segment with its first-ever scooter, the Tesseract. The Tesseract represents a significant evolution in India\u2019s electric mobility narrative \u2013 moving beyond basic transportation to deliver a premium, technology-driven experience that doesn\u2019t compromise on performance or range, two factors that have historically limited electric two-wheeler adoption. The Tesseract\u2019s design language carries forward Ultraviolette\u2019s distinctive aesthetic approach, sharing visual DNA with its elder sibling, the F77. Sharp, angular lines dominate the scooter\u2019s profile, with a muscular stance that immediately distinguishes it from conventional electric scooters. The front features an aggressive LED headlight assembly with signature DRLs that create an unmistakable road presence. Unlike the rounded, approachable designs common in the scooter segment, the Tesseract embraces a more technical, performance-oriented appearance. The bodywork features sculpted panels with aerodynamic considerations, while the floorboard offers a spacious, practical layout without compromising the scooter\u2019s sporty character. Available in four color options, the Tesseract maintains Ultraviolette\u2019s commitment to premium fit and finish, with high-quality materials throughout and attention to detail that elevates it above most competitors in the segment. Designer: Ultraviolette       On paper, its technical specifications are about as impressive as the e-scooter\u2019s looks. Powered by a 14.91 kW (20.1 bhp) electric motor, it delivers performance numbers typically associated with motorcycles rather than scooters. The scooter accelerates from 0-60 km\/h in just 2.9 seconds, with a top speed of 125 km\/h (77.6 mph) \u2013 figures that put it firmly in the performance category. Battery technology has been a particular focus, with the Tesseract offering three variants with different battery capacities. The top-tier variant boasts an impressive 261 km (160 miles) range on a single charge, addressing one of the primary concerns for electric vehicle adopters \u2013 range anxiety. The battery packs are designed for optimal thermal management and longevity, with fast-charging capability that can deliver a significant charge in under an hour. The scooter features a sophisticated suspension setup with disc brakes in the front and rear, complemented by dual-channel ABS for confident braking performance. The chassis has been engineered to balance agility with stability, resulting in handling characteristics that befit its performance capabilities.  Technology is where the Tesseract pulls ahead of the pack. The 7-inch TFT display dashboard is just the start. It comes loaded with features unheard of in the e-scooter segment\u2014dual dashcams (front and back), traction control, hill-hold assist, wireless charging, dynamic stability control, and even haptic feedback on the handlebars. But the real showstopper is the integrated radar system, a first for scooters. Dubbed \u201cOmnisense mirrors,\u201d the setup provides real-time alerts for blind spots, approaching vehicles, and lane-change assistance. For a machine that\u2019s meant to zip through chaotic urban traffic, these safety features could be game-changing.       Smartphone connectivity enables features like ride tracking, over-the-air updates, and customizable ride modes that adjust power delivery and range. Additional premium features include keyless operation, geo-fencing capabilities, anti-theft protection, and remote monitoring through a dedicated mobile app. There\u2019s even a slot to store your phone while you drive, with wireless charging built into it. The scooter also incorporates regenerative braking technology that helps extend range during urban riding conditions.  The under-seat compartment boasts 34 liters of space, enough to swallow a full-face helmet. That\u2019s a big deal in a segment where most e-scooters barely have room for a grocery bag. The build quality, from the sculpted panels to the switchgear, suggests a premium experience, staying true to Ultraviolette\u2019s performance-focused ethos.  Ultraviolette has positioned the Tesseract in the premium segment, with an introductory price of $1,380 (INR 1,20,000) for the first 10,000 customers. The next 50,000 buyers will pay $1,495 (INR 1,30,000), and after that, it settles at $1,667 (INR 1,45,000). The scooter is available in three variants \u2013 Tesseract 3.5, Tesseract 5, and Tesseract 6 \u2013 each offering different battery capacities and range capabilities. While this pricing places it above many conventional scooters, the Tesseract\u2019s performance specifications, technology integration, and premium build quality position it as a value proposition for tech-savvy consumers seeking a no-compromise electric vehicle. Pre-bookings have already opened, with deliveries scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 2026.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"Comes with Essential Space with new widgets.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Last Monday, Nothing introduced its brand-new phones, the Phone 3a and the Phone 3a Pro models. They will be available for pre-orders starting this Tuesday (March 11) in certain regions. Meanwhile, the Phone 3a Pro already has a new update bringing camera improvements and more. It appears Nothing is making sure the Phone 3a Pro\u2019s first experience for users should be hassle-free and is already bringing an update before the device\u2019s availability to the masses. Tipster Ishan Agarwal on X has shared the latest changelog of the Phone 3a Pro update, which seems to have rolled out over the weekend. Nothing Phone (3a) Pro received another pre-launch OTA.Very interesting \ud83d\udcf8 camera update too.You can now share & import Camera Presets. The device also gains support for cube files for custom filters. #Phone3aPro pic.twitter.com\/G3tIWUKSjSMarch 9, 2025 The camera enhancements, per the changelog, include new camera presets for quick access, which can be shared and imported. The ability to share these presets also means exchanging your favorite camera settings and filters with others or within the Nothing community. Additionally, users can also expect support for importing cube files to use their custom filters. For the unaware, (dot)cube is a specific file format for volumetric data that includes a color grading preset. Other than these additions, in terms of camera, the Phone 3a Pro owners can also experience better overall camera performance, clarity improvements in macro mode, and refinements for portrait for accurate bokeh.  Essential Space is another interesting feature introduced with the Phone 3a series, which is accompanied by a new Essential Key on the phone placed on the right pane. It is AI-powered and, as the name suggests, does essential stuff on your phone, and the new firmware is also bringing improvements to it. After the update, users can quickly press to save what\u2019s on their screen and \u201cadd notes, long press to instantly record voice notes while saving.\u201d Then there are new Essential Space widgets included with the update that let users view their content directly on their home and lock screens.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"With post-election gains in the rear-view mirror, Morgan Stanley\u2019s (MS+1.94%) chief U.S. equity strategist is raising some concerns about the fate of the S&P 500 through at least June. The gist? The Trump bump may morph into a protracted slump. Mark Wilson said the index could suffer as much as a 5% drop to 5,500 in the first half of 2025 \u2014 according to a report cited by Bloomberg \u2014 echoing other analysts\u2019 fears regarding the near-term outcomes of tariffs, inflation, and other phenomena that have come to define the early days of President Trump\u2019s second term. The S&P 500 had fallen about 2.3% today as of 12:21 p.m. in New York. Its intraday low so far is 5,637.75 points. Since January 1, it\u2019s slipped about 3.9%. Wilson thinks the index may recover to 6,500 by year-end, but \u201cthe path is likely to be volatile as the market continues to contemplate these growth risks, which could get worse before they get better.\u201d  Yet, the strategist warned a full-blown recession could torpedo the index by 20%, adding: \u201cWe are not there, but things can change quickly [....].\u201d Even with fomenting concerns, some analysts have recently offered rosier commentary on at least a few powerhouses in tech and retail: Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"A version of this article originally appeared in Quartz\u2019s members-only Weekend Brief newsletter. Quartz members get access to exclusive newsletters and more. Sign up here. As the 25th anniversary of the dot-com bubble burst approaches, it\u2019s not crypto bros or meme stock enthusiasts keeping Wall Street veterans up at night. It\u2019s the AI gold rush that has them experiencing d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu in technicolor. While Bitcoin\u2019s wild ride and GameStop\u2019s revenge of the retail traders have provided plenty of speculative drama, it\u2019s generative AI that\u2019s triggering the most visceral flashbacks to 2000's tech implosion. The script feels eerily familiar: breathless pitches, astronomical valuations, and PowerPoints where \u201cgenerative AI\u201d has simply replaced \u201ce-commerce\u201d in otherwise identical slides. As tech giants pour billions into their AI arms race, investors are left with the trillion-dollar question: Are we witnessing the birth of the next internet, or just another spectacular bubble inflating before our eyes? Goldman Sachs, for its part, is firmly in the \u201cthis time it\u2019s different\u201d camp. The bank\u2019s chief global equity strategist Peter Oppenheimer waves away bubble concerns with a stack of spreadsheets showing the tech sector\u2019s earnings per share have skyrocketed 400% since before the financial crisis, while all other sectors limped along with a measly 25% growth. \u201cThe drivers of this success have reflected their ability to leverage software and cloud computing and to fuel high profitability generated by extraordinary demand growth,\u201d Oppenheimer writes.  But Oppenheimer himself can\u2019t ignore some troubling red flags. A handful of tech behemoths \u2014 with Nvidia leading the AI chip charge \u2014 now command a staggering portion of the entire market.  \u201cWith markets being increasingly dependent on the fortunes of so few, the collateral damage of stock-specific mistakes is likely to be particularly high,\u201d he writes. Unlike the dot-coms that could launch with little more than a server and a dream, today\u2019s AI players are burning cash at unprecedented rates. \u201cAI is driving a major capex boom and threatens to stifle the high rates of returns that have characterized the sector over the past 15 years,\u201d Oppenheimer points out, sounding less bullish with each revelation. The market watchers that believes that we are in a bubble aren\u2019t mincing words. Howard Marks, the Oaktree Capital co-founder who correctly called the 2000 crash, plastered \u201ccautionary signs\u201d all over his January investor memo, ominously titled \u201cOn Bubble Watch.\u201d Marks points out several alarm bells that are ringing for him: investors chasing returns with disregard for risk, sky-high valuations justified by dubious \u201cnew paradigm\u201d arguments, and markets displaying textbook signs of \u201cirrational exuberance.\u201d Nobel Prize-winnning economist Paul Krugman sees the market barreling toward the same cliff, pointing out that the S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio is flirting with 30 \u2014 uncomfortably close to 1999's level of 93, which Krugman says \u201clooked, and was, crazy.\u201d Krugman does spot one twist in this market rerun: \u201cAI fever is concentrated on a handful of companies \u2014 the Magnificent 7 \u2014 most of which are already entrenched quasi-monopolies.\u201d (The sassy italics are his.) Krugman cuts through the AI hype with a question investors should be asking more often: \u201cHow much bigger can the market for [Microsoft] Office or Google search get? I understand that these companies feel the need to invest in AI for defensive purposes, to fend off potential competitors. But this need should if anything make them less rather than more profitable.\u201d In other words, Microsoft didn\u2019t spend $13 billion on OpenAI because it needed new customers. It was playing defense in a zero-sum game. Among the tech bubble forecasters, none sound more alarmed than Gary Marcus, the AI researcher who\u2019s been right before about the technology\u2019s limitations. In his view, we are clearly in a bubble not long for this world, although he doesn\u2019t think generative AI is going anywhere. \u201cGenerative AI itself won\u2019t disappear,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut investors may well stop forking out money at the rates they have, enthusiasm may diminish, and a lot of people may lose their shirts.\u201d For investors caught between FOMO and financial prudence, even Goldman suggests hedging your bets. While dismissing bubble concerns with one hand, the investment bank extends the other with advice to \u201clook to diversify exposure to improve risk-adjusted returns.\u201d Classic Wall Street: bullish in the headlines, cautious in the footnotes. The real debate isn\u2019t about whether AI changes everything \u2014 it\u2019s about timing and who survives to see it. Twenty-five years ago, the internet did transform business, education, and society, just not on the timeline or in the ways dot-com investors expected. Amazon emerged from the wreckage, but only after its stock plunged 90%. Google thrived, but Excite, Lycos, and AltaVista vanished.  As Marcus points out, today\u2019s AI darlings face a similar reckoning: \u201cCompanies that are currently valued at billions of dollars may fold, or [be] stripped for parts. Few of last year\u2019s darlings will ever meet recent expectations.\u201d  The AI revolution is coming. But revolutions have a way of devouring some of their early and most eager adherents.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"        Alina Selyukh                        Hudson's Bay has entered creditor protection, struggling with debt.                                                           Adrian Wyld\/AP\/CP                                       hide caption  Canada's oldest retailer, Hudson's Bay department store, cannot pay its debts.  The high-end chain, dating back to the 17th-century fur-trade era, has been losing money and shoppers, set back by the pandemic, inflation and lately, trade tensions with the U.S. Now, it's entered a proceeding similar to bankruptcy protection and expects to close some stores.  \"The threat and realization of a trade war has created significant market uncertainty and has impacted our ability to complete these transactions,\" CEO Liz Rodbell said in a statement, referring to recent attempts to shore up investments.  On Monday, a judge in Toronto granted Hudson's Bay creditor protection, which lets the company try restructuring its debt and regaining financial footing. He began his ruling with a wistful note about the chain: \"It is hard not to have a sense of melancholy when considering the Application before me,\" wrote Justice Peter J. Osborne of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. \"Hudson's Bay is the oldest company in North America and a very prominent Canadian department store. It was founded in 1670. Now, approximately 355 years later, it is insolvent and seeks protection from its creditors.\" Hudson's Bay historically is known for striped wool blankets that were originally traded for beaver pelts. Now it runs about 80 stores, after several waves of closures and layoffs. The chain also has licenses to run some Saks Fifth Avenue and Saks Off 5th locations in Canada \u2014 remnants of once-joint ownership.  The parent company, called HBC, purchased the U.S. chains Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman last year, combined them with Saks and later spun off the Hudson's Bay department-store chain into a standalone entity. HBC is controlled by American real estate mogul Richard Baker, who previously also owned and then sold the luxury chain Lord & Taylor, which later filed for bankruptcy.  High-end department stores have struggled across North America. The pandemic, a boon for online shopping and work-from-home policies, hurt foot traffic. Then, inflation had people tightening their budgets for non-essentials. And luxury brands \u2014 a mainstay of department stores \u2014 are increasingly trying to connect directly with shoppers and open their own retail locations.  In Friday's court filing, Hudson's Bay representatives wrote that the chain was \"facing significant challenges to its ability to make payments,\" including to landlords and suppliers, \"and absent additional funding, will be unable, within the next several days, to meet its employee payroll obligations.\" The company listed 9,364 workers. \"While very difficult, this is a necessary step to strengthen our foundation and ensure that we remain a significant part of Canada's retail landscape,\" CEO Rodbell said of filing for creditor protection. \"Now more than ever, it is critical that Canadian businesses are protected and positioned to succeed.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}

So I have no idea where the truth lay in this tale. If 'They' are telling us it was considered then  you can bank on it already has happened for a large sum of money to be sure. These fucking cockroaches need to be exterminated. Makes one wonder why we even let a being called a \"billionaire\" even exist. What societal benefit is there to be found in such massive concentrations of capital in private hands? Musk, Zuckerberg, the whole lot of them are like sociological and economic black holes, sucking in wealth and free expression of ideas and puking out monetized garbage. They don't even seem to be governed by the notion of noblesse oblige. Money has no meaning for them because they have so much of it, so now it's really purely about the power. I find it helps to look at the current alleged administration and their sycophants as being participants in Professional Wrestling. They just change the good guys and the bad guys every so often to keep the proles interested in the \"sport\". Do not play along, they are all corrupt. Just imagine how much worse Zuck would be if he traded MMA training for a penile implant which got botched and how mean that would make him!  (see Musk...) The only times Zuck looked human to me is in those photos at the capital where he had a \"this is crazy scary\" look on his face while almost surrounded with evil men who make wooden freak like himself think maybe he doesn't want to become a real boy.  -- \"Ethics unwrapped\", University of Texas, 2021, October 7.

CLN Asian equities were mixed but mostly lower overnight as the Philippines and Japan outperformed while Thailand and Hong Kong underperformed. Both Hong Kong and Mainland China underperformed the region and lost some of their strong gains from last week. However, Mainland investors bought the dip in Hong Kong intensively, pouring nearly $4 billion into Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs on the weakness. There was also a significant rotation into value from growth stocks, continuing what was happening on Friday. However, health care held up better than most growth sectors. China\u2019s February inflation reading of -0.7% dinted confidence in the current market uptrend. However, there is a significant silver lining here: reversing deflation will require considerable consumer support. At the National People's Congress in Beijing, which is still ongoing, policymakers discussed more consumer stimulus and support for the economy as top priorities. They even indicated a target inflation rate of 2%. Achieving this target would be a feat indeed, and suggests more stimulus than originally anticipated. Meanwhile, Trump's tariffs are also leading to more alacrity from the central government. Trade data was weaker than expected as both imports and exports declined in February. Chart1 Yields on government have seen a slight uptick as stock momentum leads investors to own equities over stocks. We have been saying for months now that the equity risk premium (i.e. what you are paid for investing in stocks versus investing in bonds) in China has been at some of its highest levels in a decade. That gap is starting to close. This also means that policymakers will be more confident in CNY strength, making them better able to stimulate the economy. Schools in Beijing and other tier-1 are said to be introducing more education to students around AI and digital transformation. This reform to education could benefit names including TAL Education, which has become a premier education technology provider after shifting its focus from private tutoring. Xpeng was featured at this year\u2019s NPC as the electric vehicle company announced that production of its flying car could begin as soon as 2026.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"Business Insider Edition  Shelley Janek, 70, hoped to retire with a strong nest egg at her age. Instead, she's paying bills with Social Security and looking for a job.          Janek is one of millions of retirees navigating the rising cost of living in the US. Business Insider has heard fromroughly 4,000 older Americans who are struggling to make ends meet on Social Security and dwindling savings. Some, such as Janek, have told BI they're unable to retire or trying to reenter the job market to boost their income, while others are scrambling to cut their expenses.               With just over $2,000 a month in Social Security income, Janek is unable to afford most essentials, such as groceries and rent, she said. She recently moved from Sonoma County, California \u2014 where she lived for 34 years \u2014 to Casper, Wyoming. She's living with a friend to save money and applying for jobs, with no luck yet.               \"Everything is just climbing so dramatically that I think seniors are going to be in some real trouble in the future,\" she told BI.       We want to hear from you. Are you an older American comfortable sharing your retirement outlook with a reporter? Please fill out this quick form.           Janek spent her career in various roles in finance, computer programming, and environmental conservation. She said she felt financially comfortable for most of her life but never made enough money to buy her own home in Sonoma County, where median home prices are nearly twice the national average \u2014 according to the real estate platform Redfin.               Janek said that in 2021, she had to retire earlier than she expected and claim Social Security because of a health condition. She spent most of the money she saved for retirement on bills and caring for her mother.               She said it had been challenging to land a new job at her age. At some companies, she never hears back after submitting her application. At others, she doesn't pass the interview stage. She said she hadn't been able to land afull-time job and is unable to work in retail or the service industry because she can't stand for long periods of time.               This past summer, Janek moved to Wyoming in an effort to cut her living costs. She said utilities and gas are cheaper in Casper, and she saves on rent because she's staying with a friend, but there are fewer healthcare options than she had on the West Coast. Janek said she would qualify for some low-income housing, but she's been on waiting lists in California, Wyoming, and neighboring states for years without a placement.               \"It's depressing to realize that there's very few places I can afford to live,\" she said. \"And the few places I could afford to live are not places I really want to live. It's looking like I may have to leave the country.\"               Moving again could make Janek's life more affordable, but she said it would come at the expense of her community. Relocating has already been lonely, she said, and it's been difficult to reestablish care with new doctors and meet new friends.               Janek isn't sure what she'll do next, but she said it helps to know that she isn't alone: Many older Americans are struggling with finances in retirement.               \"I think there are a lot of people in my situation,\" she said.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"Tesla stock officially traded lower Monday than it did ahead of President Donald Trump\u2019s November victory, wiping out what was once a 91% gain for shares of the electric vehicle company run by Trump lieutenant Elon Musk, as Tesla becomes the face of the ongoing stock market slide. Tesla CEO Elon Musk speaks at a Tesla event in 2022. Shares of Tesla declined more than 15% to $222, closing at their lowest share price since Oct. 23, two weeks before the election. Monday was Tesla\u2019s worst percentage loss since September 2020 and the 7th-worst day in the company\u2019s 15-year history on public markets, according to FactSet data. The dive came as part of broader losses tied to concerns about Trump\u2019s economic policies, as the tech-concentrated Nasdaq Composite dropped 4% and crossed into 10% correction territory. And driving down Tesla shares specifically was a note from UBS analyst Joseph Spak calling for Tesla\u2019s 2025 vehicle deliveries to decline by 5%, which would be the second consecutive year of negative growth for Tesla, moving against consensus analyst forecasts of 12% vehicle delivery growth this year. Tesla stock is down more than 53% from its all-time high set in December, when its share price took off on the prospect of friendly Trump administration policies toward the heavily regulated company. $144.4 billion. That\u2019s how much lower Musk\u2019s $319.6 billion net worth is than his record $464 billion set in December, according to our latest calculations. Musk, Tesla\u2019s largest shareholder, is still worth roughly $110 billion more than any other person on Earth. Musk\u2019s net worth fell by $23 billion Monday amid Tesla stock\u2019s drop. Tesla stock is down 12% since Election Day. Its market capitalization is down close to $800 billion from its December peak. Musk, who donated $288 million toward Trump and other GOP election efforts, has dedicated much of the last few months to his position as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a commission Trump created to oversee cost cutting and government employee layoffs. Tesla is one of the American firms most directly affected by Trump\u2019s tariffs, as China is the company\u2019s second-largest market and Tesla\u2019s cars rely on parts from Canada, China and Mexico. Beyond tariffs, Tesla stock has been weighed down by reports of significantly lower sales to open 2025 in China and Europe as analysts warn Musk\u2019s outspoken politics are eating into Tesla\u2019s brand reputation.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"The Chinese internet and social media ecosystem is a heavily censored pool, one that aggressively bans and removes any content that is deemed unaligned to the government policies. One of the reasons why Western social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram could never make an inroad in the market is due to that extensive censorship and local data regulation laws. Meta, however, was reportedly eager to enter the Chinese market and with such eagerness that it was willing to share user data with the Chinese government and create a complex censorship filter, as well. The revelations come as part of a complaint filed by a Meta whistleblower, which contained internal documents and communication viewed by The Washington Post. Filed before the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by former Director of Public Policy at Facebook, Sarah Wynn-Williams, the 78-page complaint that the social media juggernaut created a China-favoring censorship system in China in hopes of launching Facebook in the country. According to The Post, the Mark Zuckerberg-led company also \u201cplanned to install a \u201cchief editor\u201d who would decide what content to remove and could shut down the entire site\u201d during times of social unrest. The company is claimed to have created a dedicated team for its planned China operations as part of an internal project codenamed \u201cAldrin.\u201d But more than just creating a censorship system, Meta also was reportedly willing to stifle dissent against the government. \u201cMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg also agreed to crack down on the account of a high-profile Chinese dissident living in the United States following pressure from a high-ranking Chinese official the company hoped would help them enter China,\u201d says the report citing the complaint. Furthermore, the company was even willing to loosen its privacy rules and grant the Chinese government access to data covering China as well as Hong Kong-based users. The plans kicked into motion in 2014, but were ultimately abandoned in 2019 when diplomatic relations between the US and China were strained. Meta won\u2019t be the only player with such ambitions. Back in 2018, Google was reportedly working on a heavily censored version of Search under the codename \u201cProject Dragonfly,\u201d but the plans were ultimately put on cold ice. As of 2025, AI is the new tech hunting ground, and the spectre of Chinese censorship is clearly visible on products such as the DeepSeek open-source AI model . Meta has reportedly shelved plans to make a smartwatch, codenamed Milan, that would come equipped with two cameras. As per a Bloomberg report, the company's first smartwatch was slated to debut next year with a price tag of $349. However, the company has now canceled plans for mass production, apparently as a cost-cutting measure. As per images of the prototype shared in the report, Meta's smartwatch had a squircle display with a flat profile and a gold casing. The first 5MP camera sat on the front, positioned in a notch at the bottom of the screen. A more powerful 12MP camera was placed at the back, resting against wearer's the wrist. The other day, if you were scrolling through Twitter and avoiding Eternals spoilers and politics, you might have seen a tweet from David Imel from the MKBHD team. He was checking out the latest Pixel 6 and a Moment case, and he noticed that Moment seemed to have included MagSafe-compatible magnets with the case. Sure enough, he popped it on a MagSafe charger, and not only did the charger stick, it started charging the phone. You can watch the video below. https:\/\/twitter.com\/DurvidImel\/status\/1450859795267964935?s=20 The Google Pixel 9a is here and it has a brand new look, some new features, a tempting price, and a very tough time ahead of it. The curvy shape of the Google Pixel 8a has gone, replaced by a flat rear panel and flat sides. Not only that, but the iconic Pixel visor-style camera module has disappeared too, and the two cameras have been integrated into the back of the phone. That\u2019s right, there\u2019s no camera bump at all, making it look very unusual in 2025. Whether you already miss the best design Google has ever come up with on its phones will be down to your personal taste, but if you get the Pixel 9a in the right color, it\u2019ll still make a statement. Along with the ordinary Porcelain and Obsidian (white and black to you and me) models, there are two eye-catching versions: the purple Iris and the red-pink Peony. The Pixel 9a has an IP68 dust and water resistance rating, the rear is made from plastic, and the chassis is aluminum.

The fall in Trump Media shares occurred alongside a broader stock market selloff, with the S&P 500 falling to a six-month low, the Nasdaq Composite tumbling 4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 2.1%.

Here\u2019s how it works.  Nothing just released the Phone 3a and 3a Pro, and both are wonderful devices. Unfortunately, neither phone comes with wireless charging, let alone the latest Qi2 wireless charging standard, as I was hoping. However, with the Nothing Phone 3 in the works, the company has an opportunity to make the ultimate Qi2 accessories of my dreams. Qi2 is one of those novel features that has been much harder for the industry to adopt. Even market-leading brands like Samsung have struggled with its implementation. So, it's not exactly shocking news that a budget company like Nothing decided to skip the magnetic wireless charging option altogether. It's not like no phone from the brand has ever had wireless charging support. The original Nothing Phone 1 was one of the first cheap Android phones to bring wireless charging to the sub-$500 segment. Following that release, the succeeding Nothing Phone 2 also supported 15W wireless charging. Unfortunately, the brand's cheaper \"a\" models forgo both Qi and Qi2 wireless charging options.  My expectations were super high with the new Nothing phones. Some might even say unreasonably high, but why shouldn't they be? Smartphones are extremely, outrageously, unapologetically fun these days. They can fold in halves and threes, survive rounds in the dishwasher, and even be transparent! Nothing took a bold risk that paid off with its insanely cool see-through Android phones that come with LEDs baked into the back. It's this courage to try something unique, even if not entirely practical, that gave me hope to see Qi2 on an affordable, transparent Android phone. Even if the Phone 3a and 3a Pro don't have Qi2, I'm still going to hold out hope for the Phone 3. Can you imagine how futuristic a magnetic transparent smartphone would look like? And don't even get me started on the accessories. The brand does accessories really well, bringing that transparent, techy aesthetic to earbuds. More impressively, Nothing succeeded in creating a functional modular Android phone where companies like Google previously failed. This shows promise. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android  According to an allegedly leaked email from the CEO of Nothing, the Phone 3 is rumored to launch in the first quarter of this year. I'm shifting gears and turning my gaze towards the future. I can't wait to see what Carl Pei has in store for us. A clear phone with lights encased in a glass back is unique enough \u2014 now picture a Qi2 coil incorporated into that blueprint. Nothing will probably do all that and still maintain the water and dust-proof integrity of the device. It's going to be an epic phone if it matches my imagination. You can't have a see-through magnetic phone without companion accessories. I love anything MagSafe or Qi2, so my number one want from the brand is a transparent Qi2 power bank. Guess what? I'm not alone in my musings. A user named 3DPrintedCat took to the Nothing Community forum to share their mockup conceptual renders of what a Nothing Qi2 wireless power bank would look like. They decided to dub it the \"Battery (1),\" which is right on the money when it comes to Nothing's branding. The product concept is sleek, minimal, and highly modern. The clean white ensemble and circular lights inside the Qi2 coil have me drooling. Flat metal sides look so flattering on power banks and battery packs. It's impressive how this fan-made \"Battery (1)\" concept is so in sync with Nothing's design language. If Carl Pei does not deliver on such expectations, it's not just me who's going to be very let down. Clearly, many fans are also dying to see such an evolutionary product from Nothing. The first quarter of 2025 is almost up, so if the rumors are true, we'll find out very soon whether the Nothing Phone 3 launch will meet our expectations or fail to deliver.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"ByJohn Dorfman  ByJohn Dorfman , Contributor.  Many CEOs have been selling their own companies' stock in February and early March.  Company insiders are ditching their own stock more than usual. An exception is oil and gas executives, some of whom are buying while their shares are depressed. To gauge insider sentiment, look at the ratio of buys to sells by top executives and large shareholders. According to Gurufocus.com, about 34% of insiders\u2019 transactions normally are buys. In February the figure was only 24%. During the early stages of the pandemic in 2020, when stock prices dived, insiders stepped up to the plate and bought shares at an above-normal clip five months in a row. Insiders also bought a lot of stock in the late stages of the Great Recession in 2008. Sells normally exceed buys because top executives get some stock (often in the form of stock options) as part of their compensation. Lately, we\u2019ve seen ten months in a row of below-normal buying. According to a screen I did on Gurufocus.com, chief executive officers at 197 companies have sold stock worth $1 million or more from February 1 through March 5. At Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW), CEO Nikesh Arora sold more than $275 million of stock in February and March. Since June 2022, his share holding has fallen from about 2.9 million shares to about 1.1 million shares. His sales were under a plan that provides for selling at predetermined intervals or prices. At JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), chairman Jamie Dimon was a buyer in 2007, 2009, 2012, and 2016. Since last year he\u2019s been a seller. In February he sold $233 million of stock, or more than 11% of his holding. His remaining shares are worth about $1.6 billion. At Tempus AI Inc. (TEM), which went public less than a year ago, CEO Eric Lefkofsky cashed in more than $119 million in shares in February. That was about 8% of his holding. Bahram Akradi, the founder and CEO of Life Time Group Holdings Inc. (LTH), sold 31% of his shares in late February, for proceeds of about $150 million. The company operates a chain of fitness centers. Akradi himself is a triathlete. When CEOs sell shares, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they are bearish on the stock market or on their own companies\u2019 prospects. There are many reasons to sell, simple diversification being one. Still, when I see the number of CEOs who have sold recently, and the volume of their sales, it gives me an uneasy feeling. In the oil and gas industry I see more hopeful signs. At Noble Corp., for example, CEO Robert Eifler spent about $350,000 to add a bit to his holdings, which amount to about $31 million at current prices. Richard Barker, the chief financial officer, bought about $223,000 of Noble shares in February and has about $7 million in the stock. At Dorchester Minerals LP (DMLP), which collects royalties on oil-and-gas properties in 28 states, CEO Bradley Ehrman spent about $100,000 on his partnership\u2019s shares in early March. He has about $4 million in it. And at Matador Resources Co. (MTDR), where I\u2019ve noted insider buying previously, CEO Joseph Foran made four purchases totaling about $632,000. That brings his holding to about $245 million. Oil and gas stocks are out of favor today, and I think they are oversold. I believe these three CEOs will be happy about their purchases a year hence. This is the 73rd column I\u2019ve written about insider purchases and sales. I can tabulate results for 63 columns \u2014 all those written from 1999 through a year ago. Stocks that I said to avoid, even though insiders were buying, have under-performed the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Total Return Index by 24.3 percentage points. Stocks where I noted insider selling have done 2.3 percentage points worse than the index. Stocks I recommended based on insider buying have returned 9.1% -- not too bad, but 1.3 percentage points below the benchmark\u2019s average. Finally, there were some stocks where I noted insider buys, but made no comment or an ambiguous comment. These have beaten the S&P by 16.2 percentage points. Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn\u2019t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn\u2019t predict the future.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"Last week, Caleb Denison and I got the chance to spend some time at LG headquarters for closer looks at the 2025 models announced at CES in January. Sure, the majority of the excitement the past couple months has been around WOLED technology taking a pretty big step forward. The G5 is getting rid of MLA (Micro Lens Array) technology and the existing three layer structure \u2014 consisting of a single yellow\/green\/red layer between two blue layers \u2014 and instead using a four-layer stack with separate red, green, and (two) blue layers. It\u2019s right for this kind of news to get top headlines in the AV world, but after last week, I\u2019m equally interested in the oft-forgotten LG OLED series \u2014 the B series. The best of the best G series steals attention because it debuts the new tech each year and is the best OLED, and the C series is the best mix of performance and value, while the B series patiently waits its turn for coverage. There\u2019s only so many days in the year, and only so may TVs that can be reviewed in that time. But the B5 looks very intriguing, and it worthy of a bit of a callout. Year-over-year improvements aren\u2019t as drastic as they used to be even five years ago. TVs, from budget to high-end, are all at least pretty good. And the trickle down of performance has real impact on the lower tiers. Look at the surprise, inexpensive introduction of the Sansui OLED last year, or the newly announced Philips OLED Roku TV. What used to be a market that didn\u2019t exist, or wasn\u2019t worth recommending, now has multiple players. Judging by some of the numbers we saw this week, an OLED tier is a few years behind the tier above it. So the LG C5 performance looks possibly comparable to the LG G2, which would put the B5 on par with the LG C2 \u2014 a very good OLED TV. When people asked me what TV they should buy in 2022 (and even into 2023 before it left the market), the C2 was the quick, easy, and obvious answer. I\u2019d still be happy with it today (and my friends who bought it, are). During the opening presentation, we learned that the B5 would be available in an 83-inch model and\u2026that\u2019s it. No other size was listed in the powerpoint. Fast forward an hour, and there we were, looking at a gaming demonstration on a B5 that was most certainly 77 inches and not 83. After some questions, we found out that, yes, the B5 will be available in sizes ranging from 55 to 83 inches \u2014 the question is availability. Smaller sizes will only be available from certain retailers, but LG was not prepared to reveal which retailers just yet. We\u2019ll likely get the news in coming weeks (or a couple months, at most). Once pricing is released (I don\u2019t expect the recently announced EU prices to accurately represent the North American B5 pricing) we\u2019ll get a better sense of where things stand and how the B5 will stack up against the Philips and Sansui OLEDs (or maybe something that hasn\u2019t been revealed yet). Going by my eyes last week, though, entry-level OLED competition is about to get heated. For a long time, we've thought of Roku as the streaming media king. Not just because its software is so easy to use and its devices so affordable, but also because of its popularity -- the company has traditionally enjoyed a much larger share of the streaming market than its competitors. But it looks like the company's contentious relationships with some of the biggest names in streamed entertainment may be hurting that reputation: Amazon has just announced that its Fire TV platform has hit 50 million monthly active users on its devices globally, a number that comfortably edges out Roku, which reported 46 million monthly active users in November. It took Roku a number of months to solve its differences with NBCUniversal's Peacock, but a similar dispute with entertainment giant HBO Max continues, with no end in sight. These spats alone don't necessarily account for Roku's slower growth when compared to Amazon's Fire TV, especially given that both Peacock and HBO Max are U.S.-only services right now. Other factors include the aggressive rollout and pricing of Amazon's new Fire TV devices, which in some cases deliver more features for less money than the equivalent Roku devices. Amazon's Alexa is now built into every Fire TV device, as one example. We've been talking up the possibilities of Bluetooth's broadcast audio tech known as Auracast for some time now. And while we've been seeing it emerge more recently in devices such as Bluetooth speakers and headphones, in a world-first the wireless audio innovation has been installed in the iconic Sydney Opera House to help those with hearing needs rediscover their love for live music. You'd be forgiven if you haven't heard of Auracast, but the technology, developed by Bluetooth's governing body, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), in a nutshell, uses Bluetooth's super-efficient Low Energy (LE) Audio standard to allow high-quality audio to be broadcast from a Auracast-enabled transmitting devices to Auracast-enabled audio receivers -- in this case, hearing aids and headphones. Users can tune into the specific broadcasts using an app or other interface. There\u2019s really no such thing as a \u201cnon-smart TV\u201d these days. Still, there are those of us rocking some vintage AV tech that refuses to die, and many older TVs cannot connect to Wi-Fi. If this sounds like your household, then we\u2019re glad to bring the following offer to your attention: Right now, the Roku Express HD is marked down to $18 from $30. The last time this streaming device was this cheap was July 2024. We tested an older version of the Roku Express back in November 2019, and reviewer Simon Cohen said, \u201cWith everything you need, and nothing more, the new Roku Express is a bargain of a streamer.\u201d Upgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"From the Beetle to the Rabbit to the Golf, Volkswagen has long made affordable, practical cars that those with smaller budgets can afford. Now they're aiming that prowess at the EV market with the unveiling of their ID EVERY1.        The concept car is intended to make the transition into production for \u20ac20,000 (USD $21,667) in 2027. Hailed as \"affordable entry-level all-electric mobility\" by Thomas Sch\u00e4fer, CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, the 94hp vehicle will reportedly have a range of 155 miles.        Aesthetically, the vehicle was designed to have a friendly, approachable look. \"Our ambition was to create something bold yet accessible,\" says Andreas Mindt, Volkswagen's Head of Design. \"The ID EVERY1 has a self-assured appearance but remains likeable \u2013 thanks to details such as the dynamic front lights and the 'smiling' rear. These design elements make it more than just a car: they give it character and an identity that people can relate to.\"              The big question for Americans is whether that \u20ac20,000 sticker will apply in 2027, given the way our current administration's tariff war is going. The point may be moot; sadly, VW has announced no plans to bring this affordable EV to the U.S. market. With any luck things will change in two years' time.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":" Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Major stock indexes tanked Monday, continuing a sell-off that gathered steam last week as rattled investors began zeroing in on the prospect of a significant falloff in U.S. growth amid persistent inflation and a wobbling job market.  The broad S&P 500 index closed down 2.7%. Not only has it now given up all of President Donald Trump's post-election gains, it fell to its lowest level since September and is essentially unchanged over the past seven months. It was the biggest one-day drop since December.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 4% as it plunged deeper into \"correction\" territory, meaning it is off more than 10% from recent highs. It was its worst day since 2022.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 900 points, or roughly 2.1%. Recession fears were heightened this weekend after Trump declined to say that there wouldn\u2019t be one. In an interview with Fox News that aired Sunday, Trump responded to a question about the possibility of a recession by saying the economy was going through \u201ca period of transition.\u201d On Monday, a White House official said it's more important to look at the longer term.  \"Want to emphasize that we're seeing a strong divergence between (the) animal spirits of the stock market and what we\u2019re actually seeing unfold from businesses and business leaders,\" the official said. \"The latter is obviously more meaningful than the former on what\u2019s in store for the economy in the medium to long term.\" In a note to clients, Goldman Sachs analysts downgraded their growth prospects for the U.S. \u2014 the first time since 2022 that they had done so \u2014\u00a0citing \"considerably more adverse\" trade environment as a result of Trump's tariff policy. The firm now sees growth averaging 1.7% for 2025, down from 2.4%, with the tariffs creating a drag via higher consumer prices, higher borrowing costs and delayed investment due to uncertainty.  Few major firms were spared from Monday's drawdown. Nvidia, which has led markets higher over the past couple of years amid the AI investment boom, was down more than 4%, and is now off 22% year to date. Other major losers included Apple, Microsoft and Tesla, which was down more than 10%. The electric vehicle maker has also given up all its post-election gains as CEO Elon Musk has become a ubiquitous presence in Trump's White House.  Even before debates about how protests against Musk and Tesla have affected shares, flagging sales in Europe and especially China, Tesla\u2019s most important market, were already taking a bite out of the company\u2019s value. Those anti-Musk protest have largely been in response to the tech billionaire's leadership of Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Crypto, too, was hit Monday, with bitcoin prices falling below $80,000 for the first time since Trump's election and despite the White House convening the first-ever crypto summit Friday after announcing the creation of \"strategic bitcoin reserve\" \u2014 though some investors were left disappointed by the details.  Shares in Coinbase, the U.S.'s largest crypto exchange, fell 10% Monday and has likewise erased its post-election gains. Investors are up in arms about Trump's seemingly chaotic economic policy. The president has repeatedly started, then stopped the imposition of tariffs on America's largest trading partners, while he and Musk have implemented drastic cuts to the federal workforce that threaten to swamp an already shaky jobs market with additional workers.  \u201cWe are in the throes of a manufactured correction,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, told CNBC. \"I say manufactured because it\u2019s really based in response to the new administration\u2019s tariff programs, or at least threats of tariffs, and what kind of an impact that will have on the economy.\" At the same time, Stovall said, many traders may simply be locking in gains or taking profits from markets that had reached all-time highs under the Biden administration.  \u201cRight now we\u2019re going through a typical pullback and probably will experience a mild correction before all is completed, which actually would be good for the resetting of the dials of this ongoing bull market,\u201d he said.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"Business Insider Edition  This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Joe DePasquale, founder of the Joe Hollywood brand. It has been edited for length and clarity.          Growing up, I didn't have much. My dad was involved in drugs, and my mom struggled with a mental illness that sometimes made it difficult for her to even go outside. It was a really difficult atmosphere. I remember coming home one day to strangers at our house; it was the local church dropping off donations for us.               My prized possessions were my sports cards. My grandfather bought me my first pack when I was 8, and I absolutely treasured the cards even as I got older. I went to college in Manhattan and missed many classes because I was buying cards for 5 or 10 cents on the street corner.               Eventually, I dropped out of college to take a job in finance, making $200 a week. That job felt like a bridge between where I was and where I could be. I moved up the corporate ladder, eventually reaching leadership in my finance company. But I never felt fully financially secure, especially seeing firsthand how tumultuous the market can be.               All the while, I was still buying trading cards until I had more than half a million of them. I rented a storage unit to keep them all. In 2022, I relocated from New York City to Atlanta for my finance job. I had my dream house and decided to bring my cards home. They filled almost my basement, so my wife, Dori, suggested it was time to sell some.               My oldest son, Joe Jr., was 10 at the time. He was excited by the idea, so we started selling cards online and eventually on WhatNot, a livestreaming marketplace. At first, we were filming in the basement boiler room; the show would end when my phone battery died. As we sold more, we moved to my younger son's train table and eventually to the Ping-Pong table.               Soon, we outgrew that, and I could justify converting a bedroom into a home office for selling cards. Last year, my company did more than $5 million in sales on WhatNot.               I don't like to talk about my personal wealth or net worth. But it's clear my three children, who are now 13, 10, and 6, are growing up very differently than I did.               We like to travel as a family, including a recent Thanksgiving trip to the Bahamas. Dori and I also do smaller trips with just one of our children at a time. We're preparing to take Joe Jr. to Disney \u2014 he's never been, and neither have I. This past fall, we took our daughter to New York City and did everything she wanted, including seeing the Rockettes. Our youngest wanted to eat grilled cheese on the beach, so we took him to Turks and Caicos.               Because of my success, I can spend quality time with each of my kids. That makes up for the fact that my quantity of time is sometimes limited since I stream for 24 hours each Friday through Saturday. I still reserve Sundays for faith and family, though.               I want my children to have access to every resource they need to succeed. Joe Jr. loves basketball, so I pay for every basketball team or clinic he asks for. Whether it's dance lessons or tutoring, I'm willing to spend on it. I want my kids to work for their success, but I'll be right at their side as they do.               I know the differences resources can make. My mom didn't have money but wanted me to attend a private high school. She asked my grandmother to pay for my schooling; in exchange, my mom didn't get anything in the will when my grandmother died since the tuition was her inheritance. I'm lucky not to have to make difficult choices like that, but I'm motivated to give everything I can to my kids.               More than anything, I want my children to grow up in a positive, encouraging environment.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":" \t\t\tBy Max Goldbart, Jesse Whittock   UTA\u2019s Co-Head of Media Rights, Jason Richman, is feeling reflective after one of the most shocking beginnings to a year the entertainment industry can remember. The prominent lit exec is considering how the industry has been recovering from the California wildfires that tore through neighborhoods in January, as he prepares for the London Book Fair (LBF), kicking off thousands of miles away this week in the UK. Richman will be repping the likes of Adam Kay\u2019s thriller A Particularly Nasty Case and Jemimah Wei\u2019s The Original Daughter and sees the event as a reset opportunity for the international book-to-screen market.  \t           \t\u201cThe fires in L.A. were an awful way to start the year,\u201d he tells us. \u201cAs L.A. heals, rebuilds, and transitions into our new normal, the film and TV industry is ramping back up. Lots of new development has commenced, and there seems to be a renewed energy and excitement to escape into a great book and help shepherd its journey to screen.\u201d     \t\t\tWatch on Deadline\t\t        \t \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tRelated Stories\t\t \t              \tAgencies \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\tDan Levy Signs With CAA For Representation\t\t \t\t\t                \tNews \t    \t \t\t \t\t\t\t\t'The Dig' Producer Ellie Wood To Develop Barbara Pym's 'Excellent Women' Through Deal With Banijay UK\t\t \t\t\t        \tIn a volatile economic climate, many will be hoping Richman\u2019s sentiment manifests at the LBF, where hoards of TV and film executives will attend alongside the great and the good of the literary business. In recent years, one of the busiest weeks in the publishing calendar has seen something of a small and big screen invasion, as producers and agents sniffing out the next Normal People, Lessons in Chemistry or Conclave descend on the English capital to see what\u2019s what.  \tThis year, sources predict the LBF will be packed full of TV and film folk, but in a market battling multiple headwinds, and with many book-to-screen projects currently stuck in limbo, there are question marks over getting projects over the line.  \t\u201cAgents are skeptical about those big-name TV companies who were going in and buying expensive book options with these huge claims, and now nothing has happened,\u201d one producer tells us. \u201cWhen film and TV agents send catalogs out to producers there are lots of books you see and you just think, \u2018Oh my god that\u2019s out of option.\u2019 We are a long way from the craziness of 2022.\u201d  \tThat \u201ccraziness\u201d saw dozens of British books taken on for option by the big American players during what was a post-Covid boom era for the TV drama industry. But three years on, the UK TV industry has been rocked by the revelation that a number of high-profile projects for pubcasters are effectively stuck in limbo as big American players pull out of the co-pro market, with a number of these projects understood to be book adaptations. One high-profile example we revealed recently is the BBC\u2019s adaptation of Douglas Stuart\u2019s Booker Prize winner Shuggie Bain. \u201cThe big literary titles are really struggling,\u201d says the producer.   \t           \tUnited Agents\u2019 Jen Thomas is repping a number of novels and clients at the LBF and says there is \u201cslightly more caution\u201d than in previous years, with buyers mostly keen to see how well books perform post-publication rather than snapping novels up before they come out.  \tBut Thomas notes that the market \u201cfeels resilient\u201d and says her diary is stuffed full of meetings. \u201cWe\u2019ve not had any big ticket items that have stalled,\u201d she adds. \u201cThis is mainly about getting face-to-face time with the in-house book scouts at the studios, freelance book scouts and producers. It is often a busy time on the publishing side so I get to learn about what\u2019s coming down the pipeline.\u201d  \tWith the TV slowdown in mind, sources predict the pendulum may swing back to the big screen when it comes to options. Hannah Griffiths, Banijay\u2019s Head of Adaptations, says the industry may channel the 1990s when \u201cspeculative\u201d film options for books of yesteryear were much more in vogue. She points to the success of Edward Berger\u2019s Oscar winner Conclave, which was based on a Robert Harris book from nearly a decade ago, and she predicts recent hit novels like Booker Prize-winner Orbital, a high-concept offering that is set in space, may struggle in the optioning market.  \tThe big TV adaptations that have broken through in recent months, such as Sky and Peacock\u2019s The Day of the Jackal, Netflix\u2019s One Day and Disney+\u2019s Rivals, are unlikely to be the sort of deals that will be struck at LBF, Griffiths adds.  \tUnited Agents\u2019 Thomas, who reps the likes of What it Feels Like for a Girl scribe Paris Lees, says LBF is a \u201cgood time to remind people of our backlist that may have fallen out of option,\u201d adding: \u201cSometimes you can have another bite of the cherry in terms of this matchmaking.\u201d  CAA books agent Yasmin McDonald strikes an optimistic tone, positing that \u201chaving IP at the heart of the project tends to be reassuring to broadcasters and financiers,\u201d and adding: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got prestige IP then it could attract big actors, writers and directors, and having those elements helps get something to screen more quickly. In a funny way, the constraints of the past couple of years allow IP to break through.\u201d  \tHelping the market along is a rise in translation deals in the weeks and months leading up to the LBF, McDonald and her colleague Michelle Kroes tell us. In an \u201chistorically unusual\u201d move, they say plenty deals have been struck on the non-English translation side before a book is sold to an American publisher due to the growing appetite for non-English fare. \u201cThat is a good indicator of how buoyant the market is, and I think film and TV buyers are tracking what\u2019s happening with that,\u201d says McDonald.  Trends and buzz   \t\u201cThere isn\u2019t a real \u2018book of the fair\u2019 right now,\u201d says Claire Lundberg, owner and CEO of literary scouting agency CTL Scouting, who is keeping a close eye on what organically materializes during the market, where there are many breakout contenders. \u201cThere\u2019s no Ministry of Time or Lessons in Chemistry this year.\u201d  \tThere is buzz building around the likes of Five by Ilona Banister and Alan Opts Out by Courtney Maum, which are cited by sources as ones to watch. We also published a review of seven titles that come with strong credentials from the likes of The Night Agent scribe Matthew Quirk, This is Going to Hurt writer Kay and Oliver Bullough, whose books on money laundering have been agenda-setting.  \t           \tSeveral sources have pointed to Broken Toys, a book by British journalist and editor Marie-Claire Chappet that sits in the curious publishing subgenre of young adult novels set around elite Scottish universities. Set in 2008 and following two young women who form a complicated friendship to as they study and party through their uni years, it has drawn comparisons to Saltburn. UK agency Peters Fraser + Dunlop is billing it as \u201ca sharp, searing campus novel; a Prep for the next generation, for those enraptured by Euphoria.\u201d  \tThe Peters Fraser + Dunlop media rights agent representing the title at LBF, Rosie Gurtovoy, confirms there have been bids. \u201cThere\u2019s been an amazing response, and we\u2019ve had just over ten offers from the U.S. and UK, with streaming platforms backing bids,\u201d she says.  \tPerhaps the Scotland trend has something to do with St Andrews University, where Prince William met and began his relationship with Catherine, Princess of Wales (then simply Kate Middleton), which was portrayed in The Crown. \u201cBroken Toys is brilliantly adaptable, with a great ensemble cast,\u201d says Gurtovoy. \u201cIt\u2019s witty and racy with lots of emotion, centering on the British university experience. It\u2019s a novel slightly younger readers can aspire to and older readers will feel nostalgic for, and that\u2019s what\u2019s interesting for TV: Streamers and producers want this type story after One Day and Normal People.\u201d  \tNot only that, but Gurtovoy notes its open-ended conclusion leaves a second season possible, which plays into the need for returnable stories. Many of the books that have broken through as TV shows in recent years have been limited series, but these are considered more and more risky in today\u2019s complicated economic climate. A number of the people with spoke with for this article note how key returnability has become to getting projects off the page and into production. Lundberg, who started out working for Scott Rudin and ran MGM\u2019s New York lit office before launching her consultancy, notes how things are coming full circle \u2013 or almost.  \t\u201cWhen I started, I was doing feature scouting primarily as television was very focused on syndication, and it is quite hard to get to 100 episodes,\u201d she recalls. \u201cOnce that broke down, many books that are great limited series came through. That financial model doesn\u2019t really work now, and people just want more episodes. It\u2019s not 100 episodes anymore, but it is not limited series.\u201d  \tShe says the current sweet spot is finding books that can provide around three seasons of roughly 35 episodes. These often need an \u201cengine\u201d such as a family business or a crime syndicate at their core to allow producers to build out characters and plots while staying close to the main themes.  \tWith this in mind, United Agents\u2019 Thomas says she has clocked an \u201cuptick\u201d in children\u2019s books being optioned and made into animated projects, which can be scaled up to series of around the 20 to 25 episode mark for networks like CBeebies or Sky Kids. \u201cThese are interesting deals,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat\u2019s nice for our clients is a lot of them are both writers and illustrators, so they can be involved in a creative capacity with the shows.\u201d  \tLundberg notes that the trends in book publishing and screen productions are diverging, as novel genres and themes move away from the lower-budget concepts TV buyers want right now such as procedurals.   \t           \t\u201cIn books, there is real desire for escapism, which has most manifested in romantasy, and that is very expensive on TV,\u201d she says. \u201cI tend to think any time there is a huge trend like that, which is literally raising the bottom line of publishing houses, there will be appetite, but this is coming at a time when the pendulum is tipping toward economic prudence and you don\u2019t think about that when you\u2019re writing a novel.\u201d  \tIndeed, romantasy \u2013 a subgenre of romance and fantasy \u2013 has been a huge driver in book sales, but has not mirrored that success on screen. Hulu recently scrapped a long-gestating adaptation of Sarah J. Maas\u2019s A Court of Thorns, in which a young adult huntress is transported to a magical land after killing a wolf, and Lundberg says TV execs are broadly looking at lower-budget, \u201cgrounded romance, which is easier for adaptation.\u201d  \tThere is life in the genre, though. We hear Prime Video\u2019s adaptation of Rebecca Yarros\u2019 Fourth Wing, which is set in a brutal magical war college, where students either graduate or die, is moving ahead, and there are whispers that Netflix has quietly been building a romantasy slate that should begin materializing this year.  \tAlso popular in publishing is \u2018dark academia\u2019, a broad publishing subgenre that has at least in part inspired the themes and\/or aesthetics of shows such as The Umbrella Academy, Wednesday, The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and A Discovery of Witches. Going further back, think movies including The Dead Poets Society, Cruel Intentions and Kill Your Darlings. Like Broken Toys, lots of these novels are set in Ivy League or British redbrick universities (or fictionalized versions of them).  Big agencies out in full force  \tWhether there is some business, slow business or no business, TV and film agents from both sides of the Atlantic will be out in force among the 25,000+ likely to attend the LBF. In recent years, Griffiths reckons there has been a \u201cmassive uptick in TV and film people\u201d journeying to the Olympia in Hammersmith, coupled with a slight dip in more traditional faces from the publishing world.  \t\u201cExecs, scouts and producers will fly in from all over the world,\u201d adds Peters Fraser + Dunlop\u2019s Gurtovoy. \u201cThey feel a book adaptation is a surer thing in a risk-averse market.\u201d  \tCAA, WME and UTA along with its UK outfit Curtis Brown all occupy mega stands and their mid-week parties are some of the hottest tickets in town. \u201cBased on the guestlist for UTA and Curtis Brown\u2019s party, the number is definitely up,\u201d says UTA\u2019s Richman. \u201cIn all seriousness, we\u2019re expecting a busy year across the board with many producers and executives who hadn\u2019t been in attendance in previous years making the trek over to London.\u201d  \tMost attendees are here to network and meet people from the book world. In recent years, Banijay\u2019s Griffiths says LBF has become more about networking and less about publishers signing big deals on the dotted line, which mirrors what has happened to traditional TV markets like MIPCOM.  \t\u201cTraditional agents would say they don\u2019t wait for LBF anymore,\u201d she adds. \u201cThe business carries on through the year. Every month has the same amount of submissions whereas before the market was focused on the Frankfurt Book Fair in October and London in March.\u201d  \tCAA\u2019s McDonald, who says the agency has more than 110 greenlit films, TV shows and plays based on books in the last three years, agrees, noting that LBF is now \u201cmore about relationships, getting the word out there and having that diaolgue through the year so people are aware what\u2019s coming.\u201d  \t           \tHowever the business is getting done, Richman notes there is, and always will be, business to do. \u201cUndoubtably buyers are being cautious and selective, but we\u2019re finding if they love a book, they\u2019re going all in for it,\u201d he says.  \tIn a troubled political and economic climate that has made escaping into a good book perhaps more pleasurable than ever, it will be fascinating to see how the coming days play out.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"New Tesla sales are tanking, leaving used bargains in their wake  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Whatever your political persuasion, it's hard to get away from the fact that Tesla is having a rough time at the moment, with new car sales plummeting by up to 76.6% in some markets over recent months. According to CarScoops, Tesla sales in Norway dropped by 44.4% through January and February, meanwhile in Germany, where Musk\u2019s now infamous salute arguably hit the hardest, sales were down a staggering 76.3% in February compared to the same period in 2024. The picture looks even gloomier when you consider that in both the Norwegian and German markets, overall EV adoption has steadily been on the rise, with sales in Germany climbing 30.8% in February, and Norway\u2019s EV market growing by 53.4% since the beginning of the year. Tesla diehards will be keen to point out that the updated Model Y likely has something to do with it, as customers put off buying new and wait for that car to arrive in key markets, such as China, Australia and much of mainland Europe in the coming weeks. Whether or not it's down to a general waning of consumer demand for Tesla products, or customers holding off for refreshed product, it\u2019s hard to ignore the fact that these price crashes are also happening across the used market, too. According to Forbes, the average price for a used Model Y in the US has dropped by more than $6,000 over the last 12 months to about $30,000 this month, according to data it received from used car experts CarGurus. The same thing is happening to older, higher-mileage Model 3s, which Forbes says can now be picked up for less than $15,000, making them a veritable used bargain for first-time EV buyers. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. But the anti-Tesla sentiment that is rife in the US right now could well see stock lingering on used-car forecourts for longer, as buyers actively choose to move away from the brand. In the US, some Tesla owners have even resorted to sticking rival automotive badges onto their vehicles in an effort to disguise them. This behavior is contagious, and is impacting the overall demand for Musk\u2019s product, with web searches for Tesla vehicles dropping 7% this February, compared to the same period last year, while searches for other used EVs spiked 28%, according to Davide Greene, an industry analyst who spoke to Forbes.  With continuing threats of demonstrations and even violent actions at Tesla dealerships, the outlook for the brand isn\u2019t rosy right now. And to make matters worse, some big-name Tesla advocates are turning their backs on Tesla. Recently, Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak went on record to say that Tesla is \u201cthe worst in the world\u201d when it comes to user interface, citing the fact that constant updates to the infotainment system have made it a \u201cmiserable\u201d experience, according to Fortune. Wozniak was an early advocate of Musk\u2019s, praising the entrepreneur and publicly revealing his love for his Model S. Similarly, big-name celebrities, such as Sheryl Crow, have publicly waved goodbye to their Teslas in recent months. One 2024 article by The Hollywood Reporter claimed that \u201cHollywood Can\u2019t Ditch Its Teslas Fast Enough,\u201d citing numerous industry experts that have seen demand for Musk\u2019s electric vehicle plummet from an all-time high 10 years ago as it loses market share to Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and relative newcomers like Polestar. However, some investors believe that the refreshed Model Y will see Tesla\u2019s fortunes change, seeing as the model has historically accounted for a large proportion of the company\u2019s overall sales. This Reddit Post offers a rather more upbeat assessment of Telsa's fortunes compared to the pummeling the company is getting elsewhere in the press at the moment, but only time will tell if Elon\u2019s brand damage has been permanent or not. Leon has been navigating a world where automotive and tech collide for almost 20 years, reporting on everything from in-car entertainment to robotised manufacturing plants. Currently, EVs are the focus of his attentions, but give it a few years and it will be electric vertical take-off and landing craft.

{"date":"2025-03-10","content":"Americans should come up with a totally new calendar to measure how long they\u2019ll be affected under the president\u2019s tariff plan, per the president. During an interview with Fox Business\u2019s Maria Bartiromo that aired Sunday, Donald Trump dodged whether the country would dive headlong into a recession, and suggested that Americans should model their economic projections on a 100-year model\u2014like China\u2014rather than assess his performance on a quarterly basis. \u201cAre you expecting a recession this year?\u201d Bartiromo asked. \u201cI hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we\u2019re doing is very big,\u201d Trump said. Instead, Trump said, \u201cThere could be a little disruption.\u201d \u201cLook, what I have to do is build a strong country,\u201d the president continued, responding to criticism about the recent stock market drop. \u201cYou can\u2019t really watch the stock market. If you look at China, they have a 100-year perspective. We have a quarter. We go by quarters. And you can\u2019t go by that.\u201d Trump: \"There could be a little disruption. Look, what I have to do is build a strong country. You can't really watch the stock market. If you look at China, they have a 100 year perspective. We go by quarters. And you can't go by that.\" pic.twitter.com\/xv5hQGDvw7 Last month, Trump announced he would impose a 25 percent tariff on goods from America\u2019s closest neighbors. Two days later, he backtracked, giving Canada and Mexico a one-month delay. On March 4, the tariffs went into effect, sparking retaliatory tariffs from Canada, as well as outcry from America\u2019s Big Three automakers.  A couple more days later, Trump directed another one-month pause for goods that met his 2020 trade deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which a White House official told CNBC covered roughly 50 percent of Mexican imports and 38 percent of Canadian imports. And then, in an interview that aired Friday, Trump said the tariffs could go higher than 25 percent. As a result, the last week saw drastic market fluctuations, with the stock market tumbling as the tariffs went into effect. The Dow dropped 670 points, and by the end of the week, Republican lawmakers were fed up. \u201cThe tariffs could go up as time goes by, and they may go up,\u201d Trump told Bartiromo. \u201cWe may go up with some tariffs. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll go down, but we may go up.\u201d \u201cFor years, globalists have been ripping off the United States. They\u2019ve been taking money away from the United States, and all we\u2019re doing is getting some of it back, and we\u2019re going to treat our country fairly,\u201d Trump said, echoing language from one of his former key advisers, Steve Bannon. \u201cThis country has been ripped off from every nation in the world, every company in the world. We\u2019ve been ripped off at levels never seen before, and what we\u2019re going to do is get it back.\u201d Donald Trump wants Americans to \u201cshut up\u201d about the soaring price of eggs.  Trump shared an article on Truth Social Saturday titled, \u201cShut Up About Egg Prices\u2014Trump Is Saving Consumers Millions,\u201d written by Charlie Kirk, the CEO of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, which assisted the president during his campaign.  The article posited that Democrats were \u201cpositively giddy about the price of eggs,\u201d which reached $8 a dozen last week. While Democrats may long for \u201cproof that these backward, \u2018extreme\u2019 MAGA Republicans didn\u2019t know what they were voting for,\u201d the high price of eggs was \u201cin no way President Trump\u2019s fault,\u201d Kirk wrote. Kirk echoed the right-wing claim that the high egg prices were the fault of the Biden administration, because it had killed way too many chickens in response to the bird flu outbreak\u2014in reality, that\u2019s an Agriculture Department policy that has continued during the first months of the Trump administration.  Kirk also claimed that it didn\u2019t matter if egg prices went up\u2014though Trump seemed to think it did when trying to win votes on the campaign trail\u2014because the Trump administration would save consumers money in other important ways, by cutting taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security. Trump has bragged about winning the election based solely on his promise to lower the price of groceries. Since claiming the presidency, though, Trump has plainly stated that he actually has no idea how to get consumer prices down. With the president\u2019s endorsement, Kirk\u2019s article reads like an admission. \u201cI\u2019m Sorry. I Can\u2019t. Don\u2019t Hate Me.\u201d  Trump\u2019s unwieldy economic policy only makes that more clear.  The president\u2019s decision to enact steep tariffs on America\u2019s closest trading partners, Canada, Mexico, and China, led to a major sell-off in the stock market last week and new forecasts predicting a recession on the horizon. Washington Post economic columnist Heather Long said on MSNBC that it was \u201chard to envision\u201d prices coming down amid the ensuing trade war.  Trump\u2019s insistence that American consumers should keep quiet about their concerns is particularly disturbing when just last week, he seemed to soft-launch the idea that despite his promises to reverse inflation, the U.S. was headed toward another recession. Already, members of the Trump administration have been trying to sugarcoat the economic meltdown, calling it a \u201cdetox\u201d or \u201ctransition\u201d period. In a post on Truth Social Sunday evening, Trump had a much different message.  \u201cWe\u2019re going to become so rich, you\u2019re not gonna know where to spend all that money,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m telling you\u2014just watch!\u201d Marco Rubio has put the final nail into the USAID coffin. \u201cAfter a 6 week review we are officially cancelling 83% of the programs at USAID,\u201d Trump\u2019s secretary of state wrote on X early Monday morning. \u201cThe 5200 contracts that are now cancelled spent tens of billions of dollars in ways that did not serve, (and in some cases even harmed), the core national interests of the United States. \u201cIn consultation with Congress, we intend for the remaining 18% of programs we are keeping (approximately 1000) to now be administered more effectively under the State Department,\u201d Rubio continued. \u201cThank you to DOGE and our hardworking staff who worked very long hours to achieve this overdue and historic reform. \u201cTough, but necessary. Good working with you,\u201d purger-in-chief Elon Musk commented under Rubio\u2019s post. \u201cThe important parts of USAID should always have been with Dept of State.\u201d In reality, this isn\u2019t about efficiency or savings\u2014these are ideologically motivated cuts that will have devastating, deadly impacts throughout the world. Last week, Nicholas Elrich, a recently fired USAID official, noted that the cuts will lead to \u201c12.5\u201317.9 million cases of malaria with an additional 71,000\u2013166,000 deaths annually,\u201d \u201ca 28 to 32 percent increase in tuberculosis globally,\u201d \u201can additional 200,000 paralytic polio cases a year,\u201d and in a potential worst-case scenario, over \u201c28,000 cases of Ebola, Marburg, or related diseases.\u201d His sentiments were echoed across the political landscape. \u201cUSAID\u2019s own internal projections suggest hundreds of thousands of kids will die from malaria or malnutrition, or be disabled by polio as a result of this,\u201d Mehdi Hasan wrote on X. \u201cShame on Rubio and Trump. Cruel and catastrophic beyond belief.\u201d \u201cHuge mistake. We needed reform of USAID not dismantlement,\u201d wrote Stanford professor Michael McFaul. \u201cChina is not ending is foreign assistance programs. In an age of great power competition, the Trump administration is unilaterally destroying one of our best instruments of soft power influence.\u201d \u201cYou sad, shitty human,\u201d said Lincoln Project founder Rick Wilson. \u201cYou know the damage to America this will do in the world, but can\u2019t resist the lure of power and Trump\u2019s approval.\u201d The Trump administration detained a pro-Palestine activist Saturday night in a chilling assault on free speech. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a leader in the Columbia University protest movement, despite his being a green card holder. Initially, they told his lawyer, Amy Greer, that his student visa was being revoked, even though he didn\u2019t have one. When ICE agents were informed over the phone by Greer that Khalil has a green card, they reportedly hung up the phone on her. \u201cOn March 9, 2025, in support of President Trump\u2019s executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism, and in coordination with the Department of State, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student. Khalil led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,\u201d a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, said. Secretary of State Marco Rubio posted about Khalil\u2019s arrest on X Sunday, adding, \u201cWe will be revoking the visas and\/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\u201d It was unknown where Khalil was being held for days, but on Monday, the ICE locator finally showed him in the LaSalle Detention Facility in Louisiana. His wife is eight months pregnant and a U.S. citizen. \u201cICE\u2019s arrest and detention of Mahmoud follows the U.S. government\u2019s open repression of student activism and political speech, specifically targeting students at Columbia University for criticism of Israel\u2019s assault on Gaza,\u201d Greer said. \u201cThe U.S. government has made clear that they will use immigration enforcement as a tool to suppress that speech.\u201d On Friday, the Trump administration announced that it was canceling $400 million in federal grants to Columbia over its \u201ccontinued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students,\u201d a pointed reference to its pro-Palestine protest movement. Last week, Trump himself posted on Truth Social, \u201cFederal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests,\u201d threatening to deport foreign students who take part in such protests. Khalil\u2019s detention appears both to follow up Trump\u2019s threat against pro-Palestine protesters and to continue to make an example out of Columbia University, despite the institution\u2019s crackdown on student activists. Legal challenges to this assault on the First Amendment are surely coming, but it remains to be seen if the legal system will reinforce the right to free speech or strengthen the Trump administration\u2019s draconian efforts.  Trump is soft-launching a recession.\u00a0 The president has now twice refused to rule out a recession in the wake of his own policies, including reckless tariff wars and massive cuts to the federal government.\u00a0 \u201cLook I know that you inherited a mess,\u201d Fox\u2019s Maria Bartiromo asked him on Sunday Morning Futures. \u201cBut are you expecting a recession this year?\u201d \u201cI hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we\u2019re doing is very big. We\u2019re bringing wealth back to America, that\u2019s a big thing. And there are always periods of.\u2026 It takes a little time, it takes a little time. But I think it should be great for us,\u201d Trump responded, completely avoiding the question. \u201cA lot of people said \u2018Oh, this is the business president,\u2019\u201d Bartiromo continued. \u201cAnd now we have tariffs and the market has been going down.\u201d \u201cWell not much, in all fairness.\u201d \u201cYou said \u2018Look, we\u2019re gonna have disruption but we\u2019re OK with that.\u2019 Is that what you meant; the stock market going down was the disruption?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cLook what I have to do is build a strong country. You can\u2019t really watch the stock market.\u2026 What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re building a tremendous foundation for the future.\u201d Bartiromo pressed even further. \u201cThe public companies wanna make sure that we have clarity. After April 2, when those reciprocal tariffs go in, is that it? Are you gonna change anything after that? Will we have clarity?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll have a lot. But we may go up with some tariffs, it depends. We may go up, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll go down, but we may go up. They have plenty of clarity.\u2026 They always say that,\u201d Trump said.\u00a0\u00a0 Trump continued this economic dismissiveness later that same day.\u00a0 \u201cAre you worried about a recession?\u201d a reporter asked him on Air Force One Sunday evening. \u201cMaria Bartiromo asked you, and you kind of hesitated.\u201d The president shrugged. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, of course you hesitate. All I know is this: We\u2019re gonna take in hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs and we\u2019re gonna become so rich you\u2019re not gonna know where to spend all that money, I\u2019m telling you, you just watch! We\u2019re gonna have jobs, we\u2019re gonna have factories, it\u2019s gonna be great.\u201d\u00a0 The businesses and farmers Trump claims to be doing this for might not survive the incoming recession that these tariffs\u201410 percent on China for now, with tariffs on Canada and Mexico to be determined later\u2014will surely bring. It\u2019s obvious now that Trump couldn\u2019t care less about the American people\u2019s economic suffering as long as it serves his spiteful political goals of sticking it to our allies and kneecapping the federal government. While speaking to the press in the Oval Office Friday, Donald Trump got upset when a reporter asked him about \u201cclashes\u201d between Elon Musk and members of his Cabinet, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, during a Thursday meeting.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo clash, I was there. You\u2019re just a troublemaker, and you\u2019re not supposed to be asking that question because we\u2019re talking about the World Cup,\u201d Trump replied, referring to an executive he had just signed to prepare for the 2026 games. \u201cElon gets along great with Marco, and they\u2019re both doing a fantastic job. There is no clash.\u201d\u00a0 When the reporter tried to follow up, Trump asked him, \u201cWho are you with?\u201d The reporter replied, \u201cNBC,\u201d to which Trump said, \u201cNo wonder. That\u2019s enough. NBC.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 \"You're not supposed to be asking that question ... that's enough\" -- Trump gets mad at and shuts down a reporter who tries to ask him about reported clashes between Musk and Rubio pic.twitter.com\/yZtzwAZ426 In the Cabinet meeting, Musk had reportedly complained that Rubio hadn\u2019t fired anyone from the State Department, despite recommendations from Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency, according to The New York Times. Rubio fired back at Musk, noting that 1,500 officials had taken the government\u2019s deferred resignation \u201cbuyout\u201d program. Trump finally stepped in to defend Rubio, saying he was doing a \u201cgreat job.\u201d Musk also reportedly argued with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy over the purge of federal workers, with Duffy complaining that Musk tried to fire air traffic controllers. Musk accused Duffy of lying, and the two argued, with Musk claiming that air traffic control towers were staffed with so-called DEI hires. The Times reported that Trump ended the argument by saying that Duffy should hire air traffic controllers who were \u201cgeniuses\u201d from MIT. Trump has long had a contentious relationship with the press, and in his second term, has sought to take action against media outlets he doesn\u2019t like, taking over control of the press pool that covers the White House from the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association and shutting out the Associated Press for not adopting his name change of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. Who knows if he\u2019ll now punish NBC for simply asking questions.  Republicans have censured Representative Al Green and petitioned to strip him of his committee assignments for interrupting Donald Trump\u2019s speech to Congress. But by Friday, Representative Lauren Boebert had decided to sling some mud on the situation for good measure. \u201cFor him to go and shake his pimp cane at President Trump was absolutely abhorrent,\u201d Boebert, who was caught on surveillance footage fondling her date during a showing of Beetlejuice in 2023, told Real America\u2019s Voice. Boebert was referring to the 77-year-old Texas Democrat\u2019s walking cane. When Trump claimed during his Tuesday night speech that he had been given a \u201cmandate\u201d by the American people to radically reimagine the federal government, Green interrupted the president by yelling, \u201cYou have no mandate to cut Medicaid!\u201d That got Green ousted by House Speaker Mike Johnson, who called on the sergeant of arms to remove the 77-year-old from the chamber against a backdrop of jeers from Republicans. \u201cI did it from my heart, and I will suffer whatever the consequences are,\u201d Green told reporters the next day. \u201cBut truthfully, I would do it again.\u201d Senate Republicans are working to pass a budget that even party members have recently admitted will result in a $880 billion cut to Medicaid, much to the chagrin of their own constituents. The multibillion-dollar cut is a trade-off for conservatives who were tasked by Donald Trump to extend his 2017 tax plan, which will overwhelmingly benefit corporations and is projected to add as much as $15 trillion to the national deficit. Green\u2019s protest was practically the only noticeable rejection of Trump\u2019s agenda that Democrats could muster Tuesday night. Other liberal lawmakers were torched for flipping paddles that read \u201cFalse,\u201d \u201cMusk Steals,\u201d and \u201cSave Medicaid\u201d in a silent protest in the face of the administration\u2019s apparent oligarchy and its systemic dismantling of the federal government. And viewers watching live at home would never have known that a handful of Democrats stood up and walked out of the chamber in protest, as TV cameras never bothered to pan to their mute, \u201cdignified\u201d spectacle. Others, such as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Patty Murray, opted to not show up at all. Donald Trump is continuing to crack down on free speech by threatening to revoke a program that forgives the student loans of federal and non-profit employees, teachers, police, and pastors, among others.  Trump signed an executive order Friday barring individuals who engaged in \u201cimproper\u201d activities from receiving relief under the government\u2019s Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, a Bush-era policy that cancels student loans after 10 years of payments.  This move is clearly intended to have a chilling effect on the work of non-profits, which operate in some of the policy spaces most affected by Trump\u2019s agenda, such as immigration. Under Trump\u2019s order, loan forgiveness could be stripped away from individuals who provide legal support, advocacy, or education work on behalf of undocumented immigrants.  In addition to targeting work on illegal immigration, the White House said that the order would exclude individuals whose work had been tied to foreign terrorist groups. This is a clear sign they intend to continue cracking down on pro-Palestinian advocacy and activism.  The Trump administration previously threatened to revoke federal funding from any schools that allow large protests, and on Thursday announced it would cancel $400 million in grants to Columbia University for \u201cinaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\u201d Meanwhile, earlier this week, the university once again sicced police officers on its own peaceful student protesters, and has begun investigating students over speech critical of Israel.  As of December, more than two million Americans had eligible employment and open student loans, according to the Associated Press. While only a small percentage of claims are eligible for relief through PSLF, the work of hundreds of groups may be affected by Trump\u2019s order.  Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, wrote on X Friday that Trump\u2019s order was \u201cshockingly unlawful and a clear First Amendment violation.\u201d \u201cThe PSLF program provides the president no authority to restrict it to only those people who work for nonprofits whose work he supports,\u201d Reichlin-Melnick wrote. \u201cExpect lawsuits within short periods of time.\u201d DropSite News\u2019s Ryan Grim sarcastically quipped that he\u2019d heard from the Supreme Court that \u201cthe president can\u2019t change the terms of student loans,\u201d a dig at the high court blocking President Joe Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness efforts. The Trump administration is canceling $400 million in grants to Columbia University over what it says is \u201cthe school\u2019s continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\u201d In reality, the president is clamping down on pro-Palestine protests that began in late 2023, when Israel responded to Hamas\u2019s attack on the country with a brutal military campaign that human rights organizations have called genocide. Columbia had some of the highest profile protests of any American college campus at the time, setting up an encampment and briefly occupying a university building.  On Thursday, the administration\u2019s Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, made up of staffers from the Justice Department, Health and Human Services Department, Education Department, and the General Services Administration, told Columbia that it would soon be conducting a \u201ccomprehensive review\u201d of their federal grants and contracts. That review seems to have taken all of one day.  In a statement, Education Secretary Linda McMahon implied that Columbia did not comply with federal laws against discrimination.  \u201cSince October 7, Jewish students have faced relentless violence, intimidation, and anti-Semitic harassment on their campuses \u2014 only to be ignored by those who are supposed to protect them,\u201d the statement read. \u201cUniversities must comply with all federal antidiscrimination laws if they are going to receive federal funding. For too long, Columbia has abandoned that obligation to Jewish students studying on its campus. Today, we demonstrate to Columbia and other universities that we will not tolerate their appalling inaction any longer.\u201d Left out of the statement was the fact that the university is facing a lawsuit from three students alleging civil rights violations, breach of contract, negligence, unlawful eviction, and other Title VI violations over Columbia\u2019s harsh crackdown on pro-Palestine student protesters.  In recent months, the university\u2019s new disciplinary committee, the Office of Institutional Equity, has brought several cases of discriminatory harassment against students who expressed criticism of Israel. \u201cInfractions\u201d include writing an op-ed in the student newspaper calling for divestment from Israel, sharing social media posts supporting the Palestinian people, or joining \u201cunauthorized protests.\u201d  These actions appear to have been for naught in the eyes of the Trump administration, which appears to be trying to make an example out of Columbia and suppress criticism of Israel and support for Palestine. Trump is fulfilling a threat he made on Tuesday, when he said in a Truth Social post that \u201cAll Federal Funding will STOP for any College, School, or University that allows illegal protests\u201d and threatened to deport foreign students who take part in such protests.  The notion of \u201cillegal protests,\u201d particularly in places like colleges and universities which have a long legacy of protesting going back decades, seems to be a massive violation of the Constitution and the First Amendment, and contradicts Trump\u2019s own claim that he \u201cstopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America.\u201d But Trump has never been consistent on any principles, and seeks to punish anyone who goes against his views.  Donald Trump is desperately trying to solve the country\u2019s egg crisis, and failing. Amid a record-breaking outbreak of avian flu that\u2019s decimated egg production across the country, the cost of eggs has skyrocketed. Nationwide, a dozen eggs sold for $4.95 on average in January, up from $2.52 last year. Trump\u2019s solution? To import 70 million\u2013100 million perishable and fragile eggs from other countries within the next month. The plan is as foolproof as it sounds. With a short shelf life, strict trade requirements for animal products, and countries abroad experiencing their own egg shortages due to bird flu, Trump is realizing that importing eggs isn\u2019t easy. Despite the rise in demand from the United States, there aren\u2019t enough eggs to ship; just 3 percent of the world\u2019s egg supply enters global trade. \u201cIt\u2019s a very local industry. If you want to rebalance the market, you need big volumes. It\u2019s almost impossible, in the short term, to do that,\u201d animal protein expert Nan-Dirk Mulder told Bloomberg. Some of the world\u2019s top egg-exporting countries have received egg-import requests from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Bloomberg reported. But Poland faces health certification barriers for selling eggs in U.S. retail stores. Last month, the U.S. pulled import licenses for eggs from the Netherlands\u2014the world\u2019s top egg exporter\u2014due to industry practice concerns, but Trump plans to reinstate the license in a desperate bid to get Americans their eggs. As usual, the president and his cronies are blaming Democrats, not the disease that\u2019s killed more than 166 million commercial birds and devastated farms across the country. \u201cThis shows the price of eggs over the last 40 years,\u201d Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in an interview with Fox News, while pointing to a graph. \u201cAs you can see, the price was pretty static for 40 years, 50 years actually, and then all of a sudden under Obama it went up a little bit, Trump went down, and then Biden it has skyrocketed.\u201d Amid the excuses, consumers, retailers, and farmers continue to pay the price.","label":0}

Asian and European markets were mixed Tuesday. But U.S. shares were somewhat higher in futures trading, according to Bloomberg. After falling more than 1,000 points in afternoon trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended at 41,912, down 890 points, or 2.1%.\u00a0 The president's trade war with China heated up on Monday as Beijing began implementing retaliatory tariffs on a range of American farm products for which China is the largest market. That includes a 15% levy on U.S. chicken, wheat and corn, as well as a 10% tax on soybeans, pork, beef and fruit.\u00a0 Ontario, Canada's most populous province, on Monday also said\u00a0it is adding a 25% surcharge to all electricity exports sent to the U.S. as part of that nation's response to the White House's tariffs on Canadian products.\u00a0 \"Stocks are back in the red as psychology deteriorates further and investors continue to aggressively de-risk,\" Adam Crisafulli, a market analyst at Vital Knowledge, wrote in a midday update. \"The drivers of the weakness are the same that have been weighing on sentiment since the middle of February: concerns about slowing growth, a destructive pro-tariff agenda by Trump (coupled with a high economic\/financial pain threshold among White House officials), and elevated valuations.\"\u00a0 The S&P 500 slid 2.7%, or 187 points, to 5,615, its worst day of the year. The S&P shed 3.1% last week, its worst weekly performance since September.\u00a0 The tech-heavy Nasdaq was hit even harder, falling 728 points, or 4%, after entering a correction last week. Tesla shares plummeted more than 15%, and Alphabet, Apple and Nvidia each lost about 5%.\u00a0 Wall Street's losses come a day after Mr. Trump declined to state whether he expects a recession this year, with the president telling Fox News in an interview broadcast on Sunday that \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big.\" That said, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that there is no reason to ready for a recession.\u00a0 Goldman Sachs on Monday said it was downgrading its economic growth forecast for 2025, previously 2.4%, to 1.7%, citing the stronger headwinds resulting from the Trump administration's trade policies. \"We now see the average U.S. tariff rate rising by 10 [percentage points] this year, twice our previous forecast and about five times the increase seen in the first Trump administration,\" Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman, in a note to investors. The Trump administration last week imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico before pausing the levy days later for goods covered under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada agreement.\u00a0 The White House is sticking with its stance that tax cuts and tariff revenue ahead will bolster the economy, which is hitting investor sentiment, with last week marking the largest market rout since Mr. Trump was re-elected four months ago.\u00a0 The S&P 500 continued its fall from a record high in February, with strategists cautioning of ongoing stock volatility amid uncertainty about U.S. trade policy, tariffs and inflation. Some economists believe inflation is likely to rise this year, with economists at Morgan Stanley Research and Goldman Sachs\u00a0recently hiking forecasts. \"The risks of higher inflation as a result of a broader tariff war have taken a back seat in the overall market view recently, as the risks of slower economic growth have shifted to the forefront,\" stated John Canavan, lead U.S. analyst at Oxford Economics.\u00a0 The White House agency of cutting taxes and regulation is geared toward bringing manufacturing and jobs back to the U.S., but the ultimate outcome of Mr. Trump's policies is far from clear.\u00a0 \"Many investors support the president's pro-growth business agenda, but the administration's frenetic approach to policymaking is unsettling,\" according to Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\u00a0 Kate Gibson is a reporter for CBS MoneyWatch in New York, where she covers business and consumer finance.  \u00a9 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.
