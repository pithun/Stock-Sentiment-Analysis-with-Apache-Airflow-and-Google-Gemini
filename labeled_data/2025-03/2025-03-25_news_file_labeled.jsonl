{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"by  Andrew J. Hawkins Since early February, Tesla has been the target of protesters opposed to CEO Elon Musk\u2019s unprecedented takeover of the federal government. As Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) eliminates humanitarian aid programs and fires tens of thousands of government workers, demonstrators are expressing their rage by picketing Tesla showrooms and demanding Tesla owners sell their vehicles. Others have taken things further, defacing Tesla vehicles with anti-Musk slogans, smashing windows, and even setting some Tesla property on fire. Musk\u2019s allies in the Trump administration are threatening to prosecute anyone caught defacing Tesla vehicles by classifying the acts as \u201cdomestic terrorism.\u201c Meanwhile, Tesla stock is on a rollercoaster, and investors are wondering when they can expect Musk to end his side quest with the government and get back to business making cars and preparing Tesla for a more uncertain future. Read on below as we keep track of all the chaos that\u2019s embroiling Tesla. Andrew J. Hawkins Amid growing fallout over Elon Musk\u2019s involvement in the Trump administration, Tesla\u2019s sales fell a staggering 13 percent in the first quarter of 2025 year over year.  The company said it produced a total of 362,615 vehicles in the first three months of the year, including 345,454 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles and 17,161 \u201cother vehicles,\u201d which includes the Model S, Model X, and Cybertruck. Tesla also said it delivered a total of 336,681 vehicles, including 323,800 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles and 12,881 other vehicles \u2014 a 12.9 percent decline compared to Q1 2024. (For a direct-to-consumer company like Tesla, deliveries are a proxy for sales.) The Verge Thousands of anti-Tesla protesters took to the streets Saturday March 29th in opposition to Elon Musk and his efforts with DOGE to eliminate humanitarian aid, close federal agencies, and fire government workers. It was the culmination of nearly two months of steady, almost daily demonstrations aimed at hurting Tesla\u2019s sales \u2014 and ultimately Musk himself. Today was billed as a \u201cGlobal Day of Action\u201d with protests targeting hundreds of Tesla locations in the US, Canada, and Europe. The Verge wanted to check the temperature and see how these protesters were thinking about this current moment, and whether they felt their boycott was having its desired effect. Tesla sales have slid significantly since the protests started, and its stock has shed a lot of its value. But Musk shows no signs of being deterred, as he ramps up his threats to sic the government on anti-Tesla forces.  Richard Lawler\u00a0and\u00a0Andrew Hawkins Is Tesla really cooked? Watch as The Verge transportation editor, Andrew Hawkins, walks us through how Elon Musk\u2019s unprecedented takeover of the federal government has transformed public opinion of his car company into something increasingly toxic instead of futuristic, with some owners suddenly selling their cars even at a loss. Richard Lawler An arrest has been made in connection with a recent incident where someone wearing all black threw Molotov cocktails at vehicles and spray painted \u201cresist\u201d on the doors of a Tesla collision center in Las Vegas. As reported earlier by the Las Vegas Review-Journal and other outlets, Paul Hyon Kim has been arrested and is facing charges including arson as well as the destruction of property, and law enforcement officials said he would also be booked on federal charges later today. Andrew J. Hawkins The company\u2019s sales in January and February are down nearly 43 percent year over year, according to new registration data from the EU. Meanwhile, overall electric vehicle registrations are up 28 percent across the continent, as EVs capture 15.2 percent of total EU market share. People still really like EVs, just not the one associated with Elon Musk.  [acea.auto] Richard Lawler A report in the New York Post on Monday revealed the existence of a new 10-person FBI task force focused on vandalism and other activity aimed toward Tesla in response to the actions of Elon Musk.  Like Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s re-announcement last week of old charges against people accused of targeting Tesla locations for vandalism and arson, today\u2019s announcement didn\u2019t come with specific new details. It did come with more statements calling the acts \u201cdomestic terrorism,\u201d a line pushed by Musk, Trump, and others in recent weeks. FBI Director Kash Patel repeated the phrase while sharing the story on X, also saying, \u201cThe FBI has been investigating the increase in violent activity toward Tesla, and over the last few days, we have taken additional steps to crack down and coordinate our response.\u201d  Umar Shakir At a surprise all-hands-on meeting Thursday night in Texas, Tesla CEO Elon Musk rallied up his company\u2019s employees as the brand\u2019s public reputation continues to plummet, Business Insider reports. At the livestreamed meeting, Musk told employees to \u201chang on to your stock\u201d \u2013 which declined in value by 50 percent since December \u2013 and promised big things are coming for its Cybercab robotaxi and Optimus humanoid robot. Musk deflected on the stock drop at the meeting and reiterated promises that Tesla\u2019s autonomous software used for its vehicles\u2019 so-called Full Self-Driving feature, robotaxis, and Optimus bots would bring the company\u2019s value to new heights. \u201cIt\u2019s so profound and there\u2019s no comparison with anything in the past,\u201d Musk said. He says they can make about 5,000 Optimus robots this year. \u201cI think we will literally build a legion, at least one legion of robots this year and then probably 10 legions next year,\u201d Musk said. Richard Lawler As reports of vandalism and even a supposed doxing website targeting Tesla locations and vehicles continue to appear, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a new warning about old crimes. In a Department of Justice press release, she \u201cannounced charges against three individuals responsible for the violent destruction of Tesla properties.\u201d It didn\u2019t mention that all of the arrests and charges listed had already been reported days or weeks ago. Jess Weatherbed Tesla has issued a recall for 46,096 Cybertrucks in the US to fix a fault that was causing the steel trim on some vehicles to come loose or fly off while driving. The recall applies to every Cybertruck manufactured between November 13th, 2023, and February 27th, 2025, according to the report filed with the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), with around one percent of the impacted vehicles believed to have the trim defect. This is the eighth recall for the Cybertruck since it launched in December 2023. A similar recall was issued last summer regarding a trim fault in the truck bed that also risked coming loose and creating road hazards. The latest issue has been reported directly to the NHTSA by several Cybertruck owners, alongside being documented online in Cybertruck owner\u2019s forums and teardown videos posted to YouTube by Reid Tomasko and Cody Detwiler. Nilay Patel Today we\u2019re talking about the protests against Tesla, which have been branded on social media under the hashtag Tesla Takedown. The protests are, of course, a reaction to Elon Musk, who has managed to install himself as basically a not-so-shadow president who is tearing the federal government apart, leaving confusion and destruction in his wake.  A lot of people are deeply unhappy with this state of affairs. And because Musk is not an elected official but is, on some level, a car salesman, many of those frustrated and angry people are taking aim at the most visible and accessible symbol of his power and wealth: Tesla itself. Andrew J. Hawkins Tesla protesters are planning their \u201cbiggest day of action\u201d yet, aiming for 500 demonstrations at Tesla showrooms across the world on March 29th, organizers said during a mobilizing call Wednesday. The protests started at a handful of Tesla locations in early February, and has grown to hundreds of locations across the world, as more people have come out to demonstrate against CEO Elon Musk\u2019s dismantling of the federal government. Waving signs and chanting slogans, the so-called Tesla Takedown protesters have become a flashpoint for opposition to Musk\u2019s actions to eliminate federal aid programs and fire tens of thousands of government employees as the head of DOGE, or the Department of Government Efficiency. Umar Shakir A month of anti-Tesla dissent escalated this week with two reports of Teslas catching fire in Las Vegas and Kansas City.  The first incident happened early Tuesday morning at a Tesla collision center in Las Vegas, where police say a suspect in all-black gear hit several vehicles with Molotov cocktails and three bullets and painted the word \u201cresist\u201d on the doors of the facility, as reported earlier by the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Mia Sato Briefly, here\u2019s what\u2019s up with Tesla over the past few weeks: its stock is down more than 50 percent since December; Tesla sales in California are plummeting; Cybertruck deliveries are reportedly paused because the vehicles are falling apart; protesters are demonstrating outside Tesla showrooms across the country; and Tesla owners are selling their cars to avoid getting called Nazis. But that\u2019s not all. According to data from YouGov, a market research firm, the public\u2019s impression of the company has never been worse, reaching its lowest point since YouGov began tracking Tesla in 2016. YouGov asks members of the public daily questions about Tesla to gauge overall sentiment. (Sherwood first reported the data.) Andrew J. Hawkins Tesla stock plunged 15 percent on Monday, its steepest drop in five years. The price is down over 50 percent since its December highs. Tesla owners, disgusted with Elon Musk\u2019s slash-and-burn tactics for the Trump administration, are selling their vehicles at a big loss. And Tesla showrooms across the country are becoming magnets for large crowds of protesters who want to see the company fail spectacularly.  But at least Musk can still count on one guy to have his back.  Jay Peters At a White House event where he promised to buy a Tesla, President Donald Trump says he\u2019ll label violence at Tesla locations as domestic terrorism. Over the past few weeks, protests against Tesla CEO and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) head Elon Musk have escalated at Tesla locations. There have been reports of situations like gunshots at a Tesla dealership and vandalism aimed at Tesla. Emma Roth This weekend, protests escalated at Tesla showrooms across the nation. Hundreds of people gathered to boycott Elon Musk and his involvement in the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is overseeing a massively disruptive effort to fire thousands of federal workers to slash government spending. Most of these protests are associated with the Tesla Takedown movement that first emerged in February. It encourages supporters to \u201csell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines\u201d as part of efforts to \u201cstop Musk.\u201d But momentum has ramped up significantly in the past week, leading to bigger turnouts and some arrests. Andrew J. Hawkins On a recent Saturday afternoon, around 50 sign-wielding protesters stood outside the Tesla showroom in Manhattan\u2019s Meatpacking neighborhood, screaming insults at passing Tesla vehicles.  \u201cUncool car!\u201d  Andrew J. Hawkins Protestors are planning more demonstrations outside Tesla showrooms nationwide this weekend, as Elon Musk\u2019s polarizing behavior and political activities within the Trump administration continue to have negative side effects on his electric car business. The protests are being advertised on BlueSky under the tags \u201cTesla Takeover\u201d and \u201cTesla Takedown,\u201d similar to demonstrations held last weekend. At least three dozen events are listed on Action Network\u2019s website, with a banner urging people who own Tesla vehicles or stock in the company to divest, sell their vehicle, and \u201cjoin the picket line.\u201d Wes Davis Elon Musk\u2019s role in carrying out President Donald Trump\u2019s dirty work has triggered a wave of opposition that is spilling over into protests against his flagship company, Tesla. Over the last week, some people have held demonstrations while others have vandalized Tesla vehicles owned by individual buyers and showrooms \u2014 with actions stretching from New York, Colorado, and California, to as far as The Netherlands and Germany.  Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has accessed sensitive government data and cut congressionally mandated funds to agencies. After court orders demanded a halt to some of its actions, Musk and Vice President JD Vance have hinted they may ignore the rulings. Tesla\u2019s hundreds of showrooms, as well as other locations, present a ripe target for venting frustrations about Musk\u2019s political activities.

Navigating the vast smartphone market can be challenging, especially with hundreds of models available today. However, some devices stand out for their exceptional value and the Google Pixel 8a is one such example. Currently, Amazon is offering a great \u201cBig Spring Sale\u201d deal on the Pixel 8a with 128GB storage, reducing its price to $399 from $499. This massive discount is a record low price for the Google device and matches the previous Black Friday pricing. See at Amazon The Pixel 8a is powered by Google\u2019s own Tensor G3 processor which is also used in its more expensive siblings like the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro. This chip enables advanced AI features like Magic Editor, Audio Magic Eraser and Best Take which make photo editing and video improvements so easy. The device\u2019s performance is smooth thanks to its 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The Pixel 8a is very famous for its camera system which includes a 64MP main camera with optical image stabilization and a 13MP ultra-wide camera. The front-facing camera (for selfies) is a 13MP unit with a wide field of view and it perfect for capturing group selfies.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Business Insider Edition  It's been difficult to sell a home for so long now that sellers are starting to get desperate.          It's a bittersweet picture for housing affordability because it may mean some power is shifting back toward buyers.               \"With the passage of time, you essentially have some people really needing to move, despite the higher mortgage rates,\" NAR's chief economist, Lawrence Yun, told BI. \"Changes in life circumstances \u2014 marriages, divorces, looking for a better school district, a new job in a different location, or a death in the family \u2014 all these life-changing events are constantly occurring, and they accumulate.\"               However, fewer existing homes were sold last year than in any year since 1995, the National Association of Realtors said. For buyers, that presents a silver lining for affordability: A pent-up desire among homeowners to sell is helping reduce competition among buyers. For those buyers who can \u2014 or must \u2014 brave the market, power seems to be shifting in their favor as listings rise relative to the number of house hunters.               While home prices are still trending upward in tight housing markets across the Northeast, Midwest, and Southern California, they're falling in many markets in the South and Southwest. Price cuts, particularly in the South and West, are becoming more common, and the length of time the typical US home sat on the market \u2014 an indicator that prices may continue to soften \u2014 has risen for almost a full year, Realtor.com reported.               Homebuyers are \"not getting into bidding wars as often,\" Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist, told BI. \"Because there are fewer buyers, they have more negotiating power.\"               The way things are going, she added, some sellers will need to cut their asking prices. But that doesn't mean they won't get a good deal. Home prices are still 45% higher than they were just before the pandemic, according to Redfin.       Are you putting your move on hold or struggling to sell or buy a home? Share your story with this reporter at erelman@businessinsider.com.           After home prices soared amid the pandemic and the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates in 2022, many homeowners who'd bought or refinanced during the period of super-low mortgage rates in 2020 and 2021 opted to stay put. US home sales hit rock bottom in 2023 and 2024 as prices stayed high.               Although the \"lock-in\" effect is easing, housing affordability is expected to remain dismal in many markets this year.               Before the 2024 election, economists and housing researchers expected cooling inflation and interest rate cuts to boost home sales in 2025. But President Donald Trump's tariff threats and other federal policy changes have scrambled that picture, creating uncertainty that's keeping mortgage rates elevated and buyers out of the market. Now, it looks like mortgage rates are staying closer to 7% rather than cooling off as hoped.               While we're still waiting to see the full effects of major federal policy shifts on the housing market, consumers are already reacting. Consumer housing sentiment is down year-over-year for the first time since 2023, driven by the belief that mortgage rates won't come down as quickly as previously thought, according to new data from Fannie Mae. While the percentage of people who said it's a good time to buy a home rose from 22% to 24%, the portion who said it's a good time a sell a home fell from 63% to 62%.               \"If you're not sure what's going to happen in the US economy, then you probably don't want to make a massive financial decision,\" Hannah Jones, an economic research analyst at Realtor.com, told BI.               Broader consumer sentiment has plummeted under Trump, falling 22% since December, according to recent data from the University of Michigan. Consumers expect inflation to rise over the next year, and their confidence in the job market, stock market, and their own personal finances is down.               It's still possible this could all change. If Trump lifts his tariffs, inflation subsides, and the economy remains resilient, mortgage rates could come down and we could see a housing market recovery, Fairweather said.               \"We're kind of in this in-between time, intercession if you will,\" she said. \"There's maybe like a 20% chance that everything turns around in time for the spring season.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Business Insider Edition  Cathie Wood, one of Tesla's biggest cheerleaders on Wall Street, said she's sticking to her call that the carmaker will see its stock soar more than 800% by the end of the decade.          Speaking to Bloomberg, the Ark Invest chief investment officer said she sees shares of Tesla climbing to $2,600 in five years. That price target, which her firm first called in 2024, implies the stock rising 833% from its closing price on Monday.               Wood said she was undeterred by Tesla's latest sell-off. Shares of the car company are starting to rebound after plunging more than 50% from their highs late last year, with Tesla trading around $278 a share on Tuesday, rallying sharply since Elon Musk called a surprise town hall with employees last Thursday.               \"Our outlook has not changed,\" Wood said. \"What's going on right now, very short term.\"               Tesla's decline is mainly driven by concerns about the US economy, as well as the political climate in the US, Wood said, likely referring to Tesla owners offloading their cars and people protesting and vandalizing Tesla vehicles as Musk pursues his government cost-cutting goals with the Department of Government Efficiency.               But economic concerns aren't unique to Tesla, Wood said, noting that the current climate wasn't good for any automaker. Political pressures will also likely pass, she said, pointing to vandalism of cars and dealerships in particular.               \"This is criminal activity, and this administration is cracking down on criminal activity,\" she said. \"By the way, Tesla cars have a lot of cameras on them.\"               Tesla also has a handful of new models in the pipeline, Wood added, suggesting they could boost car sales. The company is releasing a refreshed version of its Model Y and could potentially roll out the low-cost Tesla that Musk has teased for years. The car could potentially be priced as low as $30,000, Wood speculated, stating that there is demand for such a budget-friendly Tesla car.               But Wood is most bullish on Tesla's other projects.               The company is due to launch its\u00a0robotaxi service\u00a0in Austin, Texas, this June. The robotaxi service could account for 90% of Tesla's value in the next five years, Wood estimated.               Wood said her team had added to its Tesla position amid the stock's decline in recent weeks. As of Tuesday morning,\u00a0ARKK, the Ark Innovation ETF, held $651 million worth of Tesla stock, accounting for 11% of the total fund.               Musk singled out Cathie Wood by name when describing the bull case for Tesla at his surprise hands-on meeting last Thursday, when he urged Tesla employees to hold onto their shares of the carmaker.               \"Some people, like Cathie Wood at Ark Invest, do see the future,\" Musk said. \"So what I am saying is, hang on to your stock.\"               Wood's fund has underperformed market in recent years. Over the last 12 months, ARKK gained 8.3%, compared to the S&P 500's 10.5% gain. Over the last three years, the fund has lost 15%, according to information on its website, despite a double-digit gain in the benchmark index.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Business Insider Edition  Early investors in Anduril have been getting a lot of reachouts from people clamoring to snap up their shares.          Jackson Moses, founder and managing partner of defense-focused firm Silent Ventures, \"started getting pinged left and right\" about two years ago on the secondary market to sell his interest in Anduril, which he first invested in in 2021. His phone started ringing more over the past year and rang even more in the past few months.               \"The last six months have been pretty crazy,\" he told BI. \"Every reputable family office and institution wants to know, how can I buy this?\"               Moses was one of five VCs and brokers BI spoke with who described intense demand but limited supply for secondary shares of Anduril, the defense tech startup founded in 2017 by Palmer Luckey, a 32-year-old entrepreneur with a penchant for mullets and colorful Hawaiian shirts.               Unlike stock in public companies like Amazon or Google, which anyone can instantly buy or sell, trading shares of private companies is much more opaque, requiring middlemen and weeks of time to finalize. Sellers are usually employees or early investors looking to cash out, while buyers include VCs, family offices, and hedge funds.               \"Everyone is fighting to get shares now,\" said a secondary broker who declined to be identified for fear of alienating Anduril. \"There's a frenzy to get shares.\"               In the past six months, Anduril has climbed from fifth to fourth on the rankings of companies with the most order volume (behind only SpaceX, ByteDance, and OpenAI) on Caplight, a private market exchange for shares of startups.               According to Caplight, buyers are willing to buy Anduril shares at $56.67 per share, which is an implied valuation of $36.3 billion, a 63% increase over the past six months. The company last raised financing last summer at a valuation of $14 billion, or $21.74 per share, per Caplight.       A CNBC report that Anduril was in talks to double the company's valuation to $28 billion led to more interest, according to Greg Martin, managing director and co-founder of Rainmaker Securities, a secondary platform.               \"After we started hearing about the new round, we started to see new bids come in,\" Martin said. \"I don't have anything to add to CNBC's reporting,\" said an Anduril spokesperson.               With all that demand, few deals are actually being completed because, like many private companies, Anduril tightly controls its own stock.               \"Anduril's common stock is subject to transfer restrictions, and we don't allow secondary transactions,\" explained the Anduril spokesperson.               Some buyers have been skirting the company's rules by buying stock in special-purpose vehicles (SPVs), a financial structure that allows a group of investors to pool their funds, that operate in a gray area.               Sydecar, an SPV and fund administration platform, saw greater volume in Anduril SPV deals transacted by organizers on its platform in the first quarter of 2025 than it did all of last year, according to Sydecar chief operating officer Shriram Bhashyam.               Driving the demand is a perfect storm of Anduril signing lucrative contracts, a charismatic founder, and a favorable climate for defense tech startups under the Trump administration, according to Martin.               \"I think all of those roll up nicely into a really good story, and the financials are there behind it,\" said Martin. \"They have amazing backers. So there's a lot to like about the company.\"               Other defense startups \u2014 such as Armada, Castelion, Hadrian, Helsing, and Saronic \u2014 are also seeing strong demand, according to Moses, who holds those companies in his portfolio.               \"I think it's likely a demand function because defense tech is finally an obvious and, importantly, broadly accepted investment opportunity set,\" Moses said of increased interest in defense tech, especially on the secondary market. \"Geopolitical instability, market volatility, political uncertainty \u2014 these are macro factors we all experience daily.\"               Not all VCs are as enamored by Anduril. One defense tech VC who asked to remain anonymous for fear of alienating Anduril said he was recently offered shares at a $33 billion valuation. He passed because he thought the price was too high.               But that VC was very much in the minority of those BI spoke with.               \"We get hit up every day to sell Anduril, but we're not,\" Neil Keegan, co-managing partner and CEO of defense-tech firm Marlinspike, which first invested in 2022. \"Even if you can get it approved by the company, we're not selling.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Business Insider Edition  Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio is joining Indonesia's new sovereign wealth fund, Danantara, as a special advisor.          The fund announced on Monday that Dalio is part of a \"dream team\" of advisors that includes economist Jeffrey Sachs and former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.               Last month, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto launched Danantara to manage national investments and consolidate several state-owned companies.               The fund is focused on \"high-impact projects that will create significant added value for our nation, will create real benefits, create quality jobs, and bring long-term prosperity to the people of Indonesia,\" Prabowo said.               He said Danantara would start with a $20 billion initial investment budget and eventuallymanage assets worth more than $900 billion. The fund plans to invest in national industrialization and projects focusing on processing natural resources.               A sovereign wealth fund is a government-owned investment fund made of money generated by the government. They typically invest in a variety of assets like stocks, bonds, startups, and real estate. Singaporean state-owned investment fund Temasek has a net portfolio value of $290 billion, while Norway's Government Pension Fund Global, the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, is valued at approximately $1.79 trillion.               Dalio founded Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, in 1975. He has written several books on financial and economic history and has spoken frequently about the soaring debt problems in the US and China.               He is worth $16.2 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His representative did not respond to a request for comment.               Dalio joins Danantara at a time when the sovereign wealth fund is under scrutiny about transparency and governance.               This month, Prabowo's administration started transferring ownership of 40 state-owned companies to Danatara. The sovereign wealth fund reports directly to the Indonesian president.               Investor concerns over Prabowo's grip on power have contributed to a slump in Indonesia's stock market \u2014 the largest by market cap in Southeast Asia.               Indonesia's benchmark Jakarta Composite Index is one of the world's worst performers this year. It's down 12%in 2025 as foreign investors flee, pulling over $2 billion from the market, according to Bloomberg estimates.               Meanwhile, the Indonesian rupiah is also one of the worst-performing emerging market currencies this year. On Tuesday, the rupiah hit its lowest level since June 1998 amid the Asian Financial Crisis.   Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Business Insider Edition  Tesla's sales in Europe plunged in the first two months of the year, according to official industry figures released on Tuesday.  Elon Musk's EV maker sold just under 27,000 vehicles in January and February, compared with more than 46,000 during the same period last year \u2014 a 42.6% decline.               The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) figures cover the European Union, UK, and European Free Trade Association countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.       Tesla's slide comes despite wider EV sales rising 28.4% to more than 255,000 in Europe in January and February, accounting for 15% of the EU market. Other manufacturers posted overall rises, with Volkswagen group sales up 4.3% and the Renault group up 8.2%.               Hybrid-electric vehicles took 35.2% of the market, with the combined market share of petrol and diesel cars falling to 38.8%, down from 48.5% in the first two months of last year.               Tesla has faced backlash over Musk's aggressive cost-cutting efforts at DOGE and his\u00a0courting\u00a0of\u00a0far-rightpolitical parties\u00a0in Europe, which have sparked\u00a0protests against his EV maker, instances of vandalism, and\u00a0boycott calls.               While it is hard to quantify the extent to which Tesla's reputation has been affected in Europe, JPMorgan analysts said in a note published earlier in March that the scale of the change to Tesla's brand value is unprecedented.           \"We struggle to think of anything analogous in the history of the automotive industry, in which a brand has lost so much value so quickly,\" JPMorgan's analysts wrote.               Adding to Tesla's challenges, Chinese EV giant BYD surpassed Tesla in revenue for the first time, reporting 777 billion yuan for 2024, which equates to roughly $107 billion at current exchange rates, compared to Tesla's $97.7 billion.               Tesla stock plunged more than 50% in the last three months, with JPMorgan analysts slashing their price target to $135 earlier this month.               However, after weeks of losses, shares have rebounded 16% since Musk's Thursday town hall. At the meeting, he urged employees to hold the shares, citing Tesla's robotics and robotaxi developments as key to a \"future of abundance.\"               While analysts have been divided on where the stock is headed, Ark Invest's Cathie Wood shared Musk's view at the HSBC Global Investment Summit in Hong Kong on Tuesday.               She said robotaxis will \"account for 90% of the value of the company in five years\" due to the relatively higher margins of self-driving software compared to EV sales.               \"So we think Tesla and BYD are both in the lead from an EV point of view alone. If you layer in robotaxi, of course, BYD is not seizing the moment there, at least not yet,\" Wood said.               Wood isn't the only investor who believes Tesla sales could rise in the long run.               TD Cowen's Itay Michaeli wrote last week that Musk's politics might help Tesla \"net meaningful sales gains over time\" in Republican-oriented regions where EV adoption has typically been low.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Business Insider Edition  Earlier this month, standing on the White House driveway, President Donald Trump hawked a fleet of gleaming Teslas with the kind of gusto normally reserved for his campaign rallies. Clutching handwritten notes about prices and models, he said, \"I'm going to buy one because it's a great product, as good as it gets.\" Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO and a key figure in the administration, stood nearby.          Many assumed Musk's proximity to Trump would be a net positive. But his involvement with the DOGE office and its efforts to shrink the federal government have triggered an identity crisis within Tesla. Musk has been quietly shifting rightward for years. Public sentiment, analysts, and owners didn't turn until it became clear that DOGE was more than just a passing fancy \u2014 one with the power to affect millions of Americans.               To understand how Musk's foray into the federal government has threatened to upend Tesla's position as the world's most valuable automaker, Business Insider spoke with more than two dozen employees, investors, analysts, and customers.               As one former Tesla sales manager put it, \"it feels like he's supporting someone that goes against Tesla's original mission.\"               Musk appears to have recognized the stakes. On Thursday, Tesla held a surprise after-hours all-hands that was livestreamed to the public from its Texas Gigafactory. It caught employees and investors off guard, and it appeared to be an attempt at damage control. Musk implored employees not to sell their stock and admitted that he had been \"stretched pretty thin.\"               Tesla and Musk are used to dire predictions. Musk has said the company nearly collapsed during Model 3 \"production hell,\" and critics have repeatedly declared the electric-car maker doomed over the past decade. Each time, Tesla has defied expectations and emerged stronger.               For some employees, analysts, and investors, Musk's political entanglements now represent a different challenge as the company's increasingly unpopular CEO becomes the face of government downsizing.               Tesla is at a tipping point.               For the better part of a decade, Tesla has been a Wall Street phenomenon. Its stock surged over 1,000% in a five-year period as employees, investors, and customers remained loyal to one of the few successful green car companies. They were willing to overlook provocative tweets and missed deadlines in exchange for explosive growth.               Then came February.               What began as a gentle slide became a stock slump that JPMorgan analysts called the worst they had seen in the history of the auto industry. Its stock is down 31% year-to-date, despite a recent rebound following Musk's all-hands meeting. Howard Lutnick, Trump's commerce secretary, tried to stanch the bleeding, imploring Americans to invest in the company because \"it'll never be this cheap again.\" Musk's net worth has also fallen by $129 billion since Trump's inauguration, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.               Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment.               Musk has previously spoken out against the protests at Tesla facilities, and he told employees during the all-hands that investors needed to think long-term when it came to investing in Tesla. He touted the carmaker's future in robotics and self-driving technology and predicted that \"Tesla will probably be the most valuable company in the world.\"               Last month, the Tesla investor Ross Gerber told BI that Tesla stock could fall as much as 50% in 2025, in part because the company was unlikely to reach its goal of launching a robotaxi service in Austin by June. Since then, the stock has fallen as much as 28%.               Even the longtime Tesla bull Dan Ives had a moment of concern. Musk \"needs to take a step back, balance, and become CEO of Tesla again,\" the Wall Street analyst said. \"Leaders need to lead.\" (Later, in a note to investors, Ives described Musk's surprise town hall as a \"big step forward.\")               Musk's commitment to DOGE \u2014 his private jets have landed near Tesla locations a handful of times since January 20, according to the plane-tracking site JetSpy, and he hasn't sent one of his signature companywide emails since June of last year \u2014 has been a particular source of angst for investors.               Several of the carmaker's key projects \u2014 including the robotaxi, its Optimus robot, and a $25,000 new car \u2014 are also major question marks.               At the same time, Tesla is facing more competition than ever before. Chinese manufacturers like BYD are undercutting Tesla on price while outpacing them in innovation. BYD on Monday said its sales topped $100 billion last year, outpacing Tesla. Last week it unveiled a charging station that it says is faster than Tesla's.               While Wall Street may be in a twist, many Tesla employees don't seem quite as worried \u2014 at least when it comes to the stock price. Others have expressed concerns about Musk's involvement in politics and its impact on Tesla.               \"For anyone who's worked at Tesla this isn't anything new,\" one longtime Tesla employee said. \"There's been so many ups and downs at Tesla, you get desensitized at a certain point.\" (Like several other people who spoke with BI for this story, the employee asked to remain anonymous.)               Elsewhere, cracks have started to appear.               In February, The New York Times reported that a Tesla manager, Jared Ottmann, was terminated after he criticized a social media post from Musk that referenced Nazi Germany. (In a statement, Ottmann directed BI to his attorney Jana Moser. Moser did not respond to a request for comment.)               BI spoke with two Tesla workers who left the company in recent weeks and five other employees who said they were looking for opportunities elsewhere. They all pointed to Musk's role in politics and what they felt was a move away from Tesla's original mission of building sustainable transportation.               \"Morally, I'm not sure how much longer I can work for somebody like that,\" one engineer said.               Thomas Temme, a Tesla software engineer in Germany, told BI he and other German workers had talked among themselves about Musk's new political focus, both in the US and in his promotion of the AfD, a German right-wing political party.               In Europe, where workers have more protections than in the US, employees are still concerned they could face repercussions for speaking up to management against Musk.               \"They don't speak up because they fear if they speak up, Elon might fire them or get rid of our whole department,\" Temme said.               One California-based worker described the internal corporate environment as \"unsettling.\" More than a dozenworkers have told BI over the past few months that there's been little conversation internally about Musk's role in government or the public outcry since Musk began campaigning for Trump last year.               \"I think people are on edge and aren't quite sure who they can trust,\" one worker said. \"We have a high prevalence of people on visas, and I think people are generally anxious about retribution.\"               Tesla salespeople and owners, it seems, are bearing the brunt of the public anger.               The carmaker reported several incidents of vandalism at its sales and service centers, including gunshots that blew out store windows, Superchargers that were set alight, and Molotov cocktails thrown at vehicles.               Three sales workers told BI they'd dealt with disgruntled customers and prank callers in recent weeks. They said they'd been encouraged by local management to avoid engaging with the protesters but hadn't received companywide communication about the protests.               \"They're exercising their right to peaceful protest,\" one salesperson said. \"As long as it doesn't cross into anything more we'll let them be.\"               Multiple Cybertruck owners also said they'd face growing hostility and harassment, from their cars getting hit by paintball guns and tagged with crude graffiti to being yelled at by other drivers. Recently, a webpage doxxed Tesla owners and said it would remove their personal information only if they agreed to sell their vehicles.               For those who want to sell, there's also bad news. Resale values for Teslas have fallen and are about $10,000 less than their non-Tesla EV counterparts, according to data from CarGurus. Kevin Roberts, the firm's director of economic and market intelligence, said there's also pressure on used Tesla prices because the market has been flooded with used electric cars after rental companies like Hertz have moved away from EVs.               New car sales aren't a bright spot, either. Numbers in Europe fell in the first two months of the year, according to industry figures released Tuesday. The company sold just under 27,000 vehicles in January and February, compared with more than 46,000 during the same period last year, a 42.6% decline.               In the US, new Tesla registrations fell by 11% in January, based on data from S&P Global Mobility. In Europe, registrations fell across 25 European markets by an average of 44% in February, according to JATO Dynamics data.               Some Tesla owners told BI the protests had strengthened their support for Musk \u2014 one analyst suggested recently that red states could help salvage the company's sales. Many other owners are choosing to add anti-Elon stickers to their vehicles or ditch them entirely.               Scott Oran, a real estate developer from the Boston area, said he sold his Tesla in February \"as a protest\" against Musk and his work at DOGE. Another Tesla Model 3 owner, who asked to remain anonymous, said they decided to sell for fear that Musk's political activities could cause Tesla's plummeting resale values to drop even further.               Daniel Cavanaugh, an EV owner in Los Angeles, told BI he paid $4,000 in March to end the lease of his Model 3 five months early after becoming concerned about Musk's behavior and the possibility that EV subsidies might end under the Trump administration.               \"I was actually considering getting another Tesla before the subsidies ended. But Elon's behavior was so vile I decided to shop around,\" Cavanaugh said. \"Tesla's sales slump isn't temporary. Elon is driving away customers like me and driving us to discover his competitors \u2014 and we are not coming back.\"               Since its founding, Tesla has teetered on the brink of extinction more than once.               \"Musk has this sort of innate, though sometimes tardy, ability to course correct,\" Nancy Tengler, a Tesla shareholder, told Business Insider. After selling off her shares following Musk's pot-smoking appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, Tengler said she learned her lesson when the stock surged in 2022.               \"You underestimate him at your peril,\" she said.               The company's recent market performance hasn't scared everyone off. Ives is still bullish on the stock, as is Fabian Varcianna, a shareholder who still views Tesla's technology as revolutionary. He said he invested more during the March sell-off and plans to purchase an Optimus bot. Retail traders have been gobbling the stock up as it craters.               Alexandra Merz, a Tesla investor and influencer more commonly known by her X handle @TeslaBoomerMama, told BI she thought the stock might have hit its low point last week but could dip further. She sees it as an excellent buying opportunity because of Tesla's \"milestones in the next five years.\"               Merz says she advises prospective investors to look beyond short-term volatility. \"For Tesla, in particular, you really need a horizon,\" she said.               Even with the recent crash, Tesla stock is up 63% compared with this time last year. It's still the most valuable automotive company in the world. Musk's status as \"first buddy\" could still pay off. Lutnick and Trump's sales pitches and the surprise Austin all-hands seemed to calm the waters.               The moment, though, is perilous. Musk's popularity has fallen in tandem with his status as a target for public vitriol toward the administration.               \"It's never been a political symbol, and that's what Teslas have become,\" Ives said. \"It's become a brand crisis.\"               Even Musk seems surprised.               \"Listen, I understand if you don't want to buy our product, but you don't have to burn it down. That's a bit unreasonable,\" Musk said during the all-hands.               \"If you read the news, it feels like Armageddon. I can't walk past the TV without seeing a Tesla on fire,\" he said. \"What's going on?\"       Do you work for Tesla or have a tip?

Netflix now supports streams with Samsung\u2019s preferred HDR10 Plus format, which is an alternative to Dolby Vision.  by  Emma Roth Netflix has added support for HDR10 Plus \u2013 a move that will finally allow Samsung TV owners to take better advantage of their device\u2019s ability to stream with better clarity and color. The streaming service now offers HDR10 Plus through its Premium plan, with the format accounting for around 50 percent of \u201celigible viewing hours.\u201d Samsung TVs notably lack support for Dolby Vision, an HDR format with dynamic metadata that optimizes tone and brightness levels for individual scenes. Samsung launched HDR10 Plus in 2017, which similarly makes adjustments to tone-mapping on a scene-by-scene basis, but without the royalty payments required for Dolby Vision.HDR10 Plus might be less common than Dolby Vision, but Samsung is the world\u2019s biggest TV brand, holding a nearly 30 percent market share. Without support for HDR10 Plus, Samsung TV owners have had to watch content on Netflix with HDR10. Unlike HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision, HDR10 uses static metadata for an entire film or TV show, a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach to tone-mapping that could produce less accurate lighting, especially in very bright or very dark scenes. Though not many streamers other than Prime Video supported HDR10 Plus at launch, services have gradually hopped on board, including Disney Plus, Apple TV Plus, and now Netflix. Other TVs from Panasonic, Hisense, and TCL also offer HDR10 Plus, but many support Dolby Vision, too. Netflix enabled HDR10 Plus on the AV1 video codec, which means you\u2019ll need a TV that supports the standard. Most TVs made within the last five years or so have already adopted AV1. The company says it plans on expanding its library of HDR10 Plus content to include all HDR titles by the end of 2025.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Customization is one of my favorite parts of just about any video game, followed closely by base-building elements. Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows features both, and you can even customize your base\u2014otherwise known as your hideout\u2014with cherry blossom trees, deer statues, intricate pathways, and so much more. Unfortunately, it\u2019ll cost you. Who knew interior and exterior decorating would be such a lucrative market in Feudal Japan?! If you want to uncover additional hideout decorations, there are a handful of options. Some stem from quest and contract rewards. Finding these items prove straightforward, as you\u2019re automatically rewarded once you complete the given objective. Others, however, require exploration. The painting opportunities you\u2019ll discover during your travels are the two key ways to unlock new decorations. As you stumble upon animals and scenes in the wild, Naoe can sneak up and paint a picture, unlocking a hideout decoration\u2014usually wall art or structure cosmetics\u2014upon completion. Alternatively, you can visit an ornament vendor to purchase hideout cosmetics. They\u2019re a bit expensive, though. I spent 2,000 Mon on two or three decorations on my first go-around. On top of selling a variety of hideout decorations, the ornament vendor in Oyamazaki Village also offers a few horses\u2014better than your stock mount by far\u2014along with multiple saddles. They\u2019re purely ornamental\u2014cosmetics to improve your ride\u2019s look\u2014and don\u2019t offer much, if anything, in the way of buffs. However, she\u2019s your go-to merchant if you\u2019re all about customization. You can find ornament vendors in a few of the game\u2019s small towns and most major cities, and you may even find one in small, no-name settlements along the road. Sakai has one near the Port of Sakai, right before the main dock. Just watch the merchant\u2019s districts for the white-and-black icon with a house-like structure in the center. This option might not be the most enticing, but the in-game microtransaction store (I know, yuck! In a single-player game?!) currently offers a handful of hideout packs ranging in price from 600 Helix Credits to 1,000 Helix Credits. For clarification, it\u2019s $9.99 for 1,000 Helix Credits. These packs vary in contents, but you\u2019ll most typically find statues, structure skins, trees, and even pets that\u2019ll roam your hideout looking all cute and whatnot. It\u2019s up to you whether you\u2019d like to spend real-world money to customize your in-game base, though! Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X\/S, and Windows PC.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"European sales of Tesla electric vehicles tumbled 49% in the first two months of the year even as overall sales of EVs grew FRANKFURT, Germany -- European sales of Tesla electric vehicles tumbled 49% in the first two months of the year compared with a year earlier even as overall sales of EVs grew, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.  There have been complaints about an aging lineup of vehicles from Tesla and also a significant backlash against CEO Elon Musk and his affiliation with the Trump administration in the U.S. In Europe, Musk's endorsement of Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany party in last month's national election drew broad condemnation.  Tesla faces increasing competition from major automakers as they ramp up EV production, including China's BYD. On Tuesday, BYD reported a record 777.1 billion yuan ($107 billion) in revenue for 2024 as sales of its electric and hybrid vehicles jumped 40%. Earlier this month, BYD announced an ultra fast EV charging system that it says is nearly as quick as a fill up at the gas pump. Tesla sales for January and February slumped to 19,046 from 37,311 in the same period in 2024. That comes against the background of a 28.4% increase in sales of all battery-electric cars in Europe.  German politicians and opinion media sharply criticized Musk over his support for the AfD, while Tesla vehicles and dealerships have been the target of protesters in the U.S. and Europe over the AfD endorsement and his role advising U.S. President Donald Trump in drastically reducing the size of the US federal government.  Tesla sales are falling globally, however. The company posted its first annual sales drop in more than a dozen years in January. Tesla's new Cybertruck has had multiple recalls including last week, when the company recalled nearly all of them because panels that run along the left and right side of the windshield can fly off when driving.  It was the eighth recall of the Cybertruck since deliveries to customers began just over a year ago. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Business Insider Edition  Good morning. Texting errors have happened to the best of us, but this is something else: The Atlantic's editor in chief was mistakenly added to a Signal group chat in which US security officials discussed sensitive military operations, including the Trump administration's strikes on Yemen's Houthi rebels.          Meanwhile, in today's newsletter, we're looking at Donald Trump targeting law firms that have crossed him.       What's on deck   Markets: Investors are elated after reports that Trump could soften tariffs.       Tech: Tech's honeymoon period with Trump is over.       Business: Tesla has flirted with disaster before. This time feels different.               But first, Trump shows no sign of letting up.       If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.   Lawyers and scholars describe it as an unprecedented threat to the legal community and a blow to the First Amendment.           In recent weeks, Donald Trump has targeted major law firms like Paul Weiss, Perkins Coie, and Covington & Burling.               He's ordered reviews of government contracts, stripped lawyers of their security clearances, and prevented firms' employees from entering federal buildings.               Trump accused each of these firms of weaponizing the judicial process and threatening national security by representing his opponents or participating in investigations against him. \"Dishonest and dangerous,\" Trump called them.               Some firms vowed to fight back. Paul Weiss wasn't one of them.               On Thursday, Trump announced that he had rescinded his executive order targeting Paul Weiss after the firm agreed that it \"will not adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies\" and pledged to provide the administration with $40 million in pro bono legal work.               (Paul Weiss' internal copy of the agreement \u2014 obtained by BI \u2014 omits the language about DEI that was in Trump's announcement).               Meanwhile, some in the legal community saw the firm's actions as a major capitulation. Uproar ensued, leading one associate at Skadden to publicly resign.       Brad Karp, the chairman of Paul Weiss, defended the firm's decision to negotiate with Trump in an internal memo.           Addressing some 2,500 employees via email, Karp said the executive order \"could easily have destroyed our firm. It brought the full weight of the government down on our firm, our people, and our clients.\" Read the full email here.       BI spoke with crisis management experts about what Karp got wrong \u2014 and right \u2014 by addressing the agreement.               \"Either apologize if you did something wrong, or don't apologize,\" one expert said, adding that the email contains \"gradations of both.\"               After Karp's email, more than 100 Paul Weiss alumni signed a letter slamming the Trump deal.       1. Return of the Magnificent 7. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said they believe the sell-off in Mag 7 stocks may be over, citing a weakening US dollar and improved earnings outlook. The bank said the rebound could put US markets back on top.       2. Trump mulling softer tariffs has the stock market jumping for joy. Investors are feeling good after reports that Trump's reciprocal tariffs on April 2 could be more narrowly targeted than previously thought. But they still have reason to be cautious.       3. Tesla stock is on the up and up. The EV company's shares have climbed 18% since Elon Musk's Thursday evening town hall, during which he urged employees to hold onto them. The rally has been helped along by retail investors, who have been buying the recent dip at near-record levels.       1. Tech's love affair with Trump is looking more like a fling. Though some in Silicon Valley were initially gung-ho for a pro-business presidency, they're finding Trump's actions have actually made it harder to run their companies.       2. How to survive as a software engineer in the era of AI coding. Generative AI is taking on more and more of developers' workload, but all's not lost for engineers. Even as the tech gets more sophisticated, coders can embrace these three skills to stay ahead of the curve.       3. The rush is on for secondary shares of Palmer Luckey's Anduril. Secondary-market investors like VCs and hedge funds are chomping at the bit for a piece of the defense-tech startup. But those shares aren't easy to get ahold of, and there's not many to go around.       1. Tesla's tipping point. Many assumed Elon Musk's proximity to Trump would be a good thing, but becoming the face of government downsizing has triggered an identity crisis within Tesla. Over the years, the EV carmaker and its CEO have defied expectations and emerged stronger, but Musk's political entanglements represent an entirely different challenge.       2. Social Security's customer service is about to get a lot worse. Thanks to Trump's funding cuts, changes are sweeping the SSA that could result in up to 85,000 additional visitors at local offices each week, according to an internal memo obtained by BI. That could make it harder to access benefits for some Social Security users.       3. Do not use a payment plan to order a burrito. Seriously. You can now use Klarna to pay for your DoorDash order if it's above $35 \u2014 but you might not want to. The buy now, pay later option seems attractive, but it could cost twice as much in the long run. (Read: $70 burrito.)

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"The stock rally faltered on Tuesday as U.S. consumers turned their gloomiest in over a decade and as uncertainty persisted over plans for the next round of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, set to be unveiled on April 2. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes both closed slightly higher after fluctuating, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average adding just 4.18 points. Nvidia (NVDA) stock fell 0.6%, while Tesla (TSLA) eked out a 3.5% gain even after its European unit sales and market share dropped again last month. GameStop (GME) jumped more than\u00a05% in postmarket trading after it amended its investment policy to include Bitcoin. The company\u2019s fiscal-fourth quarter earnings also topped expectations. Consumer confidence cratered in March, with the index\u2019s future expectations gauge plunging 9.6 points to 65.2, the lowest reading in 12 years. A reading of 80 or below is a recession signal, according to the the Conference Board, which conducts the survey. The headline number also fell by more than expected, and new-home sales data also fell short of estimates. The drop in the consumer confidence \u201cindex shows the new administration\u2019s plans for tariffs and spending cuts are going down like a lead balloon with households,\u201d Pantheon Macroeconomics economist Sam Tombs said. Stocks of consumption-related companies including UPS (UPS), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Target (TGT) declined on Tuesday. Dollar Tree reports earnings before the market opens on Wednesday morning. Markets rose Monday after Trump said reciprocal duties may stop short of his pledge to equalize with levels charged by foreign countries on U.S. goods. The administration may also delay duties on particular types of products. The tariffs are still set to give the market a negative surprise, Goldman Sachs (GS) economist Alec Phillips wrote in a note to clients.  Trump administration officials have said initial duties are meant as a basis for talks \u2014 which incentivizes them to set high rates, Phillips said. A recent survey shows market participants expect an initial 9 percent reciprocal tariff rate, but it may be double that level, he wrote. And despite the lowered pitch of Trump\u2019s rhetoric, the new duties are likely to cover almost all of U.S. trade, Phillips said. The president\u2019s plans to add extra tariffs on buyers of Venezuelan oil add complications, as do the possible inclusion of value added taxes (VATs) and currency undervaluations in the calculations. Stocks active Tuesday included Trump Media, which jumped 8.9% after it announced a tie-up with Crypto.com to start exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Additionally, Trump family-backed World Liberty Financial said it plans to issue a stablecoin. Boeing\u2019s (BA) stock gained 0.9% after the Wall Street Journal reported that the planemaker is seeking to withdraw its earlier agreement to plead guilty in a criminal case that alleged it deceived regulators before two fatal crashes of its 737 MAX jets. It was a bad day for Chinese EV makers, with Xiaomi (XIACF) falling o.7% in U.S. trading after saying it sold 800 million new shares for about $5.5 billion to fund its expansion plans. BYD (BYDDY) was unable to sustain Monday\u2019s post-earnings gains, with its ADRs dropping 5.2%. Decliners also included 23andMe (ME), which fell 11%, adding to Monday\u2019s 59% plunge following its bankruptcy filing. Carvana (CVNA) jumped 3.8% after Morgan Stanley (MS) analyst Adam Jonas increased his recommendation on the stock to buy from hold and bumped his price target to $280 from $260, Barron\u2019s reported. Mobileye Global (MBLY) gained 8.7% after it  announced a tie-up with Volkswagen (VWAGY) on automated-driving technology.

Amazon\u2019s Big Spring Sale kicked off this morning and it\u2019s releasing incredible deals on some of the most popular fitness trackers on the market. The Fitbit Inspire 3, which features comprehensive health and fitness tracking, is down to an all-time low of just $69 which is a massive 30% off its retail price of $99. See at Amazon This price drop is particularly notable as it matches the record low since the launch of the device (seen during last year\u2019s Black Friday)\u00c2\u00a0in September 2022. Over 10,000 units have already been sold this month alone, pointing to the popularity of this model among purchasers. The Fitbit Inspire 3 is a good choice for both beginners in fitness tracking and those wanting to upgrade from older generations: It boasts a full-color AMOLED touchscreen which is a major upgrade from the monochrome screen of the older generation. Not only does this new screen enhance visibility but it also adds the always-on display feature so that you can see your statistics at a glance without needing to raise your wrist. The Inspire 3 also boasts an extended battery life: A maximum of 10 days of use on a single charge is longer than many of its competitors including some more expensive models. That translates to less time attached to a charger and more time focused on your health and fitness goals. The device offers a wide range of tracking functions including 24\/7 heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and stress monitoring. It is capable of tracking over 20 different exercise modes from running and cycling to yoga and swimming. The Inspire 3 is water-resistant to 50 meters and can be worn for pool exercises or unexpected rainstorms. For those looking to get a more comprehensive view of their health, the Inspire 3 doesn\u2019t disappoint. It includes SpO2 (blood oxygen) tracking which can provide insights into potential changes in your overall wellness. The device also offers features like Active Zone Minutes which encourages users to reach optimal heart rate zones during workouts for maximum benefit. Although the Inspire 3 doesn\u2019t have onboard GPS like higher-end models, it can connect to your phone\u2019s GPS to precisely monitor outdoor exercises. Priced at $69 down from $99, the Fitbit Inspire 3 is an amazing value for money. It provides most of the features of higher-end fitness trackers at a much lower price. Compared to the Apple Watch Series 10, which costs roughly five times more, the Inspire 3 is a very compelling choice for anyone looking for extensive health monitoring without spending a fortune. As part of the Big Spring Sale, which is available from March 25 to March 31, Amazon has included a wide range of discounts on various categories. However, the Fitbit Inspire 3 is among the top in the fitness tracker category. If you\u2019re looking to get into wearable fitness technology for the first time, no-frills tracker.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to look hard for the best gaming handheld PC on the market today. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the Steam Deck, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always the Steam Deck, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mostly thanks to the console-like ease of SteamOS. There\u2019s good news on that front (for everybody but Microsoft). We now have several videos of SteamOS working on an Asus and Lenovo handheld, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re running games better than their Windows counterparts, even before the official release. Valve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SteamOS offers the most console-like experience for handheld PCs. So after the Steam Deck maker promised that SteamOS 3.8 will support non-Valve handhelds, gamers got excited. First on the list of consoles with SteamOS preinstalled was supposed to be the Lenovo Legion Go S. The version with Valve\u2019s operating system is supposed to arrive later this year. However, handheld-centric YouTuber Phawx posted a video of him running SteamOS on the unsupported Asus ROG Ally, one of Steam Deck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s earliest, most-capable competitors. \u00a0 This isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly the full SteamOS 3.8 release, though. Phawx crowbarred SteamOS Holo onto the handheld, which means that the software doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t recognize the handheld\u2019s back buttons or other device-specific inputs. It also continues to lock the handheld\u2019s TDP, or thermal design power, at 15 W. This means the OS isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t taking into account the Ally\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full power draw capabilities, which will necessarily limit game performance. But here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where things get exciting. At 15 W TDP, the Ally running SteamOS manages to outperform the Steam Deck. The Ally uses the AMD Ryzen Z1 Extreme chip, which is notably more powerful than the Steam Deck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proprietary, less powerful AMD processor. At those base settings, the Ally running SteamOS was outperforming the Steam Deck by 13 average FPS on Batman Arkham Knight. The Steam Deck still managed to outperform the Ally in a game like Horizon Zero Dawn: Remastered, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not like you should be gearing up to sell your precious Valve handheld on eBay. But imagine the performance and battery life you could get on the more-powerful Asus ROG Ally X. Previously, modders have managed to run Bazzite\u00e2\u0080\u0094a Linux-based operating system made to function similarly to Valve\u00e2\u0080\u0099s SteamOS\u00e2\u0080\u0094on non Valve handhelds. YouTuber ETA Prime showed off the SteamOS 3.8 beta running on a Windows-based Lenovo Legion Go S. It supports higher RAM specs than the $550 SteamOS version that is currently up for preorder. Surprisingly, the Legion Go S running SteamOS performs marginally better than the same handheld running Windows. SteamOS seems to be offering better performance on average compared to similar Windows builds. That could pose a problem for Microsoft, who is reportedly working with Asus on an Xbox-centric handheld. That handheld may run a version of Windows that will actually be usable on smaller screens with thumbsticks and buttons. But that effort won\u2019t matter if SteamOS offers only an easier-to-use interface and more FPS in games. But then Windows handheld owners could upgrade their systems for themselves, which means we\u2019re closer than ever to the perfect gaming handheld.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"World Liberty Financial, the decentralized finance protocol that was founded and run primarily by President Donald Trump\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sons, announced Tuesday that it will launch a stablecoin called USD1. That announcement comes less than one week after President Trump threw his support behind a new legal framework that would seek to normalize stablecoins. According to Reuters, USD1 will be backed by U.S. Treasury bonds, dollars, and other cash equivalents. It\u2019ll launch on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain blockchains, with plans to expand to other protocols in the future. Like most stablecoins, USD1 seeks to maintain a fixed value of $1 rather than be a more volatile token. Stablecoins are typically meant for crypto bros to park their cash in. Think of stablecoins like poker chips\u00e2\u0080\u0094you buy in with real cash, use the chips to play the games (in this case, throwing money into some memecoin or whatever), and then cash them out for real money again when you\u2019re done. But World Liberty Financial certainly seems to have a particular audience in mind with USD1. Zach Witkoff, one of the founders of the company alongside the Trumps, said the company is \u201coffering a digital dollar stablecoin that sovereign investors and major institutions can confidently integrate into their strategies for seamless, secure cross-border transactions.\u201d So it sounds like they\u2019re quite interested in overseas money. That might raise a red flag, you know, with Trump being the president of the United States and whatnot. World Liberty Financial has already been accused of basically being a favor-trading fund\u00e2\u0080\u0094for instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission paused a fraud case against Chinese national Justin Sun after he purchased millions of World Liberty Financial\u2019s token. It seems the company is inviting other overseas interests to trust it to hold onto their money with this stablecoin project. (It\u2019s also worth noting that Zach Witkoff\u2019s dad, Steve Witkoff, is currently serving as the Trump administration\u2019s Special Envoy to the Middle East.) That is far from the only red flag flying full mast with this announcement, though. Just last week, Trump spoke at the Digital Asset Summit 2025, and called on Congress to \u201cpass landmark legislation creating simple, common-sense rules for stablecoins and market structure\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094a reference to a the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act that just got approval from the Senate Banking Committee earlier this month. That bill would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins that would effectively normalize their usage in our broader financial system. A couple things to know about the GENIUS Act: First, the Senators who introduced it want stablecoins to \u201cstrengthen the dollar\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supremacy\u201d and drive \u201cdemand for U.S. Treasuries\u201d by making sure stablecoins are pegged to the dollar. Wouldn\u2019t you know it, USD1 does exactly that. Second, critics of the bill, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have pointed out that it doesn\u2019t offer sufficient national security protections and could allow money to funnel into stablecoins from foreign countries. World Liberty Financial is positioning its stablecoin as an option for foreign investors. Are those statements related? Who can say for sure. Lots of money can pass through stablecoins, and it generates big bucks for its operators. Tether reported that it racked up $13 billion in profits in 2024 alone, primarily through transaction fees and interest on its treasury holdings. This, despite the fact that most stablecoins have, at some point, become unpegged from their promised value, potentially causing instability and an inability for investors to get their money out. Seems like a promising business for the guys at World Liberty Financial, who somehow continue to be ahead of the curve on what the Trump administration plans to do with crypto regulations. Guess it\u2019s nice to have a direct line to the guy signing the laws.

Are you searching for an Apple Watch but do not wish to deplete your funds? Look no further! Amazon\u2019s Big Spring Sale offers great offers on two awesome Apple Watch designs, allowing you to purchase these extremely popular smartwatches at unbeatable costs. The Apple Watch SE 2022 is currently priced at just $169, down from of its original price of $249, and the new Apple Watch Series 10 has dropped to an all-time low of $299, a pretty significant discount from its usual price of $399.

See Apple Watch SE 2022 at Amazon See Apple Watch Series 10 at Amazon Apple Watch SE 2022 is a great value-for-money model for those on the lookout for their first venture into smartwatches. Yet, it neither cuts corners with features nor in pricing. The SE 2022 smartwatch comes with the same S8 chipset as in its pricier siblings and hence offers buttery-smooth performance and great connectivity. With a slim design in 40mm and 44mm variations (both are on sale at Amazon), it fits comfortably on all wrists. The LTPO OLED touch screen is exceptionally readable with vibrant colors and up to 1000 nits of brightness, making it easy to read even in extremely sunny conditions. While the Apple Watch SE 2022 may not have all of the advanced health sensors of its pricier siblings, it has more than enough oomph in the area of fitness tracking and safety. It can take your heart rate, monitor your sleep, and even sense a fall. The watch is also water-resistant up to 50 meters which makes it ideal for swimming. 32GB storage is also ample enough to hold plenty of apps and music. The battery is great, with 18 hours of continuous use. On the other hand, Apple Watch Series 10 is the cream of the crop of Apple smartwatch technology: Its sleek looks are thinner than ever before with options for 42mm and 46mm to suit different tastes (both are on sale too). The Series 10 has a stunning LTPO3 OLED touch screen with 2000 nits peak brightness for impeccable visibility under any lighting condition. The expanded display area provides room for more complications and effortless usage of apps. The Apple Watch Series 10 comes equipped with the latest S10 SiP, sporting a 64-bit dual-core processor and 4-core Neural Engine for swift performance and power-saving processing in the device itself. It supports 64GB of storage capacity (double the SE 2022) for saving more applications, music, and photos. The Series 10 also adds the double tap gesture to offer effortless one-hand usage and Siri on-device processing for faster answers. Fitness and health fanatics will appreciate the Series 10\u2019s advanced sensors, such as how it can perform ECG tests, track blood oxygen, and its new skin temperature sensor to be more accurate in tracking cycle and sleep. The watch also features the latest safety features, including Crash Detection and Emergency SOS. In terms of durability, Series 10 edges out at an IP6X dust rating, apart from having water resistance at 50 meters like the SE 2022. No matter if you go for the affordable Apple Watch SE 2022 or spend more on the Apple Watch Series 10 loaded with all the features, both provide unbeatable value at their sale prices during this Big Spring Sale period at Amazon.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Business Insider Edition  More healthcare clinics are getting paid based on the quality of the care they deliver rather than the volume of services provided.          Delivering better care and demonstrating better outcomes, however, requires contending with a mountain of patient data. Healthcare startup Navina says its AI can help.               Navina works with 1,300 clinics to sift through medical data from a wide range of sources, from electronic health records to insurance claims, to surface clinical insights to physicians \u2014 right in their existing workflows.               Now, Navina has raised $55 million in Series C funding to keep growing, Business Insider has learned exclusively.       Goldman Sachs' growth equity division led the Series C raise, with participation from all existing investors, including ALIVE, Grove Ventures, and Vertex Ventures Israel. The fundraise brings Navina's total funding to $100 million since its 2018 founding.               Navina's solution integrates with EHR systems like Athenahealth, Epic, and Cerner to flag potential diagnoses, identify risk factors and spot medication conflicts. The startup houses its research and development team in Tel Aviv, Israel, and its commercial team in New York City. All of its customers are based in the US.               The startup is building in a competitive market of startups using AI to harness healthcare data. Innovaccer, which announced $275 million in Series F funding in January for its AI tools that aggregate and analyze patient data to enable value-based care, is perhaps Navina's most formidable VC-backed rival.               Cofounder and CEO Ronen Lavi said Navina's advantage is its high physician satisfaction. He said the startup's tech aligns clinics' financial needs, surfacing insights during the medical coding and billing process to help clinics capture more revenue, with a great provider experience, reducing administrative burdens and helping clinicians deliver better care.               \"Once you have physician trust and they find you useful, you can expand to different use cases, and the market will be almost endless,\" he said.               Navina mostly works with midsize private clinics, but it's expanded in recent years to serve other types of healthcare companies, including organizations providing administrative support to providers. Navina has also partnered with healthcare companies working to boost value-based care adoption, including Agilon Health and Privia Health.               For its next act, Navina wants to land more health system customers. Lavi said Navina has a few midsize health system customers now and plans to announce more partnerships in the coming months.               Lavi said Navina isn't profitable yet but hopes to hit that milestone in the next two to three years. For now, the startup is focused on accelerating its growth.               Navina plans to use the Series C funding to expand into new markets across specialty care, health insurers, and pharmaceutical companies. The company also plans to enhance its offerings with ambient scribing capabilities that will \"do the full documentation for physicians,\" Lavi said.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Apple CEO Tim Cook has praised the artificial intelligence models developed by Chinese start-up DeepSeek, as the company moves closer to launching Apple Intelligence on the Chinese mainland pending regulatory approval, the South China Morning Post reports. Speaking at the China Development Forum in Beijing, a state-organized annual event designed to attract global investment, Cook reportedly referred to DeepSeek's AI models as \"excellent.\"  He did not elaborate on whether Apple would pursue a partnership with the company. Cook previously commented during Apple's January earnings call that \"innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\" in reference to AI companies like DeepSeek, which have been able to deliver impressive performance with lower cost and compute requirements. DeepSeek has been praised for developing large language models that achieve comparable results to those from U.S. firms such as OpenAI, while requiring significantly fewer resources. The firm claims that its R1 model was developed in just two months with a total cost of $5.6 million. In February, it was reported that Apple had reached an agreement with Alibaba Group to integrate the Chinese conglomerate's Qwen models into \u200cApple Intelligence\u200c for mainland users. The company is also believed to be in talks with Baidu to serve as an additional provider of large language models for the Chinese market.  In addition to his comments on AI, Cook announced plans to expand Apple's cooperation with the China Development Research Foundation, alongside continued investments in clean energy development. Throughout his visit, Cook posted updates on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, showcasing a range of Apple products being used in classrooms, creative environments, and more. Cook's comments mark a continuation of Apple's intensified focus on the Chinese market at a time when the company is facing declining iPhone shipments and heightened competition from domestic brands. Apple's smartphone shipments in China are believed to have fallen by 25% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2024, while annual shipments dropped 17% to 42.9 million units, placing Apple behind local competitors Vivo and Huawei.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Business Insider Edition  Ark Invest's Cathie Wood says she's confident in Tesla's ability to fend off rivals like BYD in the EV race.          \"So we're looking at the BYD cars, and they are fabulous, from what we can see \u2014 fit, finish, design,\" Wood told Bloomberg in an interview on Tuesday at the HSBC Global Investment Summit in Hong Kong.               \"If you look at metrics like range and power for a given price, Tesla is still very competitive, if not the most competitive, depending on the model of car,\" Wood added.               Chinese automaker BYD's performance has put a spanner in Tesla's plans to remain the world's biggest EV manufacturer. The company's revenue outpaced Tesla's in 2024, and it recently unveiled chargers that are four times more powerful than Tesla's and can charge an EV in 5 minutes.               But Wood told Bloomberg investors need to consider the additional value Tesla can get from its work in autonomous driving.               Tesla's robotaxis will \"account for 90% of the value of the company in five years\" because of the relatively higher margins that come from selling self-driving software instead of EVs, Wood added.               \"So we think Tesla and BYD are both in the lead from an EV point of view alone. If you layer in robotaxi, of course, BYD is not seizing the moment there, at least not yet,\" Wood said.               In the interview, Wood said she still stood by Ark Invest's $2,600 price target for Tesla. Her investment management firm issued the price target in June.               \"And that's not even including humanoid robots, which are now moving into the Tesla ecosystem much faster than even we expected. So more than a tenfold increase just from robotaxis,\" Wood said, referencing Tesla's Optimus robots.               Tesla's stock price has plunged by over 40% from its record highs in mid-December. The company's shares closed at about $278 on Monday, down from a peak closing price of $479 in December.               Tesla's CEO Elon Musk name-dropped Wood during an all-hands meeting on Thursday when he told employees autonomous vehicles would increase the company's value.               \"It's so profound and there's no comparison with anything in the past. It just does not compute. But it will compute in the future. And some people, like Cathie Wood at Ark Invest, do see the future,\" Musk told employees on Thursday.               \"So what I am saying is, 'Hang on to your stock,'\" Musk added.               To be sure, Wood isn't the only investor who believes that Tesla can withstand competition from BYD.        Christopher Tsai, the president and chief investment officer of Tsai Capital, told Business Insider last week that the EV market's potential for growth means Tesla and BYD can coexist.               \"We're talking about almost a hundred million vehicles a year, and there's room for more than one player,\" Tsai, who has millions in Tesla, said.                \"History shows that people will pay for something that is superior, even if there is a competing option that is free,\" Tsai added.               Tesla and BYD did not respond to requests for comment from BI.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"China\u2019s Xiaomi raised $5.5 billion in an upsized stock sale as the company moves to expand its burgeoning electric vehicle business, following BYD\u2019s (BYDDF) lead. The Beijing-based company sold 800 million shares for HK$53 ($6.82) apiece, increasing the scale of its offer. It had originally planned to sell 750 million shares for between HK$52.80 and HK$54.60. The funds will be directed toward accelerating its research and technology development. Xiaomi is one of the latest EV entrants to China\u2019s industry, better known for its smartphones and consumer tech than high-tech cars. But that didn\u2019t stop it from launching the SU7 last year, an electric car that starts at around $30,000 and was designed to rival Tesla\u2019s (TSLA) Model 3. Xiaomi has pledged to invest $10 billion to produce cars over a decade. CEO Lu Weibing has said the company aims to begin overseas shipping in 2027. Last week, Xiaomi reported an almost 50% increase in fourth-quarter revenue and raised its target for EV sales to 350,000 units from 300,000. The EV business recorded 32.1 billion yuan ($4.4 billion) in revenue from the EV sector on more than 136,000 deliveries of the SU7.  BYD, China\u2019s biggest automaker and chief rival to Tesla, raised $5.6 billion just a few weeks ago through the biggest share sale Hong Kong has seen in years, Bloomberg News reported. The Shenzhen-based firm sold 129.8 million shares for HK$335.20, up from initial plans to sell 118 million shares. BYD on Monday reported full-year revenue of 777 billion yuan ($107 billion), a 29% increase from 2023, and profit of 40.3 billion yuan, a 34% increase. The automaker beat Tesla to the $100 billion revenue milestone, with its Austin, Texas-based rival breaching $97.7 billion in 2024.  The growth of both Xiaomi and BYD comes as Tesla continues to lose market share in the world\u2019s largest auto industry to China\u2019s domestic firms, which \u2014 bolstered by generous state subsidies \u2014 have been ramping up their work in recent years. That expansion has spread to foreign markets as well.  Chinese brands accounted for 4.2% of all new car registrations in Europe last month, while Chinese-owned brands made up 6.9% of registrations, Jato Dynamics data showed Monday. Tesla\u2019s share of the market fell to 9.6%, the lowest it has been during the month of February over the past five years, the firm said.  \u201cTesla is experiencing a period of immense change,\u201d Felipe Munoz, a global analyst at Jato Dynamics, said in a statement.  \u201cIn addition to Elon Musk\u2019s increasingly active role in politics and the increased competition it is facing within the EV market, the brand is phasing out the existing version the Model Y \u2013 its best-selling vehicle \u2013 in anticipation of the introduction of a new refreshed version,\u201d he added.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"OpenAI and the MIT Media Lab last week released two new studies aimed at exploring the effect of AI chatbots on loneliness. The results are complicated, but they also line up with what we now know about social media: Chatbots can make people lonely, but the people who reported feeling more alone after heavy use of an AI tended to feel pretty alone before they started. To do the studies, OpenAI turned over almost 40 million interactions its users had with ChatGPT to researchers at MIT. In the first study, MIT looked at the \u00e2\u0080\u009caggregate usage\u00e2\u0080\u009d of around 6,000 \u00e2\u0080\u009cheavy users of ChatGPT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Advanced Voice Mode over 3 months\u00e2\u0080\u009d and surveyed 4,076 specific users to understand how the chatbot made them feel. In the second study, the researchers looked at how 981 participants interacted with ChatGPT over the course of 28 days. The papers are in-depth and complicated and worth a close read. One of the big takeaways is that people who used the chatbots casually and didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t engage with them emotionally didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t report feeling lonelier at the end of the study. Yet, if a user said they were lonely before they started the study, they felt worse after it was over. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOverall, higher daily usage\u00e2\u0080\u0094across all modalities and conversation types\u00e2\u0080\u0094correlated with higher loneliness, dependence, and problematic use, and lower socialization,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the study said. Different kinds of interaction produced different results. Lonely users using a voice-based chatbot rather than a text-based one tended to fare worse. \u00e2\u0080\u009cResults showed that while voice-based chatbots initially appeared beneficial in mitigating loneliness and dependence compared with text-based chatbots, these advantages diminished at high usage levels, especially with a neutral-voice chatbot,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the study said. The researchers were clear eyed about the results and compared the findings to previous studies on social media addiction and problem gaming. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe relationship between loneliness and social media use often becomes cyclical: the lonelier people are, the more time they spend on these platforms where they compare themselves with others and experience the fear of missing out, leading to more loneliness and subsequent usage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the MIT team wrote in their paper. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLoneliness is both a cause and effect of problematic internet use.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The researchers stressed that this first study, which looked at a large sample and relied on a lot of self-reported data, lacked a control group. It also didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take into account external factors like the weather and seasonal changes, two things that can have a massive impact on mood. Research into human emotional dependence on chatbots and its consequences is in its early days. The researchers said that companies working on AI needed to study the guardrails in their services that would help mitigate the risks of exacerbating loneliness. They also said that the more a person understood about how AI systems work, the less likely they were to become dependent on it. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFrom a broader perspective, there is a need for a more holistic approach to AI literacy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the study said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cCurrent AI literacy efforts predominantly focus on technical concepts, whereas they should also incorporate psychosocial dimensions.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The final sentence of the first study\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cimpact\u00e2\u0080\u009d section cut to the heart of the problem. \u00e2\u0080\u009cExcessive use of AI chatbots is not merely a technological issue but a societal problem, necessitating efforts to reduce loneliness and promote healthier human connections.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The loneliness epidemic is real and complex. People are lonely for a lot of different reasons. Third places like malls, bars, and coffee shops are vanishing or becoming too expensive to use. People have migrated a lot of social interaction to the internet. Living in vast suburbs and driving on a highway to get everywhere cuts people off from each other. AI didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do any of this, but it could make it worse. OpenAI partnered with MIT to conduct these studies, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a willingness to engage in the problem. What worries me is that every business invariably pursues its bottom line. In these studies I see not just an open-hearted discussion about the dangers of a new technology but also a report that will tell people with a financial interest in getting new users that its product can be addictive to a certain kind of person. This is already happening. In 2023, a Belgian man committed suicide after he had a long \u00e2\u0080\u009crelationship\u00e2\u0080\u009d with a chatbot based on GPT-4. The man had a history of depression, and his wife blamed the bot. Last year, a mother launched a lawsuit against Character.AI after her son took his life while chatting with the bot. Her 93-page court filing is a harrowing look into how Character.AI draws users in and attempts to establish an emotional connection with them. There is a market for AI companions. They can provide an ersatz connection to the lonely. But they can also induce that feeling of loneliness. The bots are also programmed by the people selling their services. They are complex machines, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still machines, and they reflect the will of their programmer, not the user.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  NVIDIA's RTX 5080 is back in stock, but it's not all good news. Despite finding a couple of Gigabyte RTX 5080s being sold straight from Newegg \u2014 no third-party seller that may or may not be legitimate \u2014 you'll need some extra dough to pick one of these up. I've known for a while that the $999 MSRP that NVIDIA roughly set for its RTX 5080 Founders Edition GPUs does not apply to cards from third-party builders like Gigabyte, and the proof is in these prices stretching beyond $1,500. Gigabyte's Gaming OC RTX 5080 comes in at $1,539.99 at Newegg, while the Gigabyte AORUS Master Ice RTX 5080 in a sleek white finish tops out at $1,629.99.

That's not to say that official retailers don't sometimes slip up and ship something erroneously, but you have far less of a chance of running into some sort of scam when buying straight from Newegg. \ud83d\udc49 Related: Where to buy NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. With these Gigabyte GPUs, you're paying way above MSRP despite buying from a reputable seller, but that's not exactly Newegg's fault. Third-party builders like Gigabyte are free to set prices as far beyond MSRP as they'd like, which is how we've arrived at these two RTX 5080s costing half again as much as you'd expect. Do I recommend spending large on one of these RTX 5080s? No, unless you have money to burn. \ud83d\udc49 Related: Don't buy an RTX 5000 GPU before reading this The current GPU landscape with severe stock shortages, looming tariff complications, and free rein from AIBs to jack up the prices as they see fit has unsurprisingly led us here. While I don't doubt there will once again be cheaper RTX 5080s available at some point, if you want one now, you're not going to get a good deal.  NVIDIA's Founders Edition RTX 5080 reviewed by Windows Central Senior Editor Ben Wilson can be seen as the reference card that third-party builders use as a guideline when designing custom GPUs. Builders like Gigabyte take the chip and build a GPU around it, which is how we get cards like the AORUS Master Ice and the Gaming OC that are, at the time of writing, available at Newegg. The biggest difference aside from aesthetics is the cooling hardware. Both of these Gigabyte GPUs have a dual-fan setup, allowing the card to run a bit faster than the Founders Edition version. For example, the RTX 5080's baseline boost clock is about 2.62GHz. The GIGABYTE Gaming OC pushes that to 2.73GHz, while the AORUS Master Ice goes up to 2.8GHz. Overall performance isn't going to differ much compared to the RTX 5080 that Wilson reviewed, so I urge you to use it as a guideline to determine whether or not it's the GPU for you. The RTX 5080 Gaming OC for $1,539 and the RTX 5080 AORUS Master Ice for $1,629 aren't going to last long despite the high pricing, so don't miss out if you've been waiting for any stock to return.

The release of the employees from the firm, the Mintz Group, comes as China is trying to woo back foreign investors to help revive its sagging economy. \"We are grateful to the Chinese authorities that our former colleagues can now be home with their families,\" the Mintz Group said in a statement to NPR. Like other due diligence firms, the Mintz Group does investigations and audits to assess risks for its clients. According to its website, the company currently has 12 offices around the world.  Chinese authorities raided several firms' offices, including Mintz's, in spring 2023, just as Beijing was preparing to host top executives at American multinationals for an annual economic conference. Mintz was later fined for conducting unauthorized statistical investigations. It is not clear what statistics were involved. The firm has now closed its Beijing and Hong Kong operations.  China has stepped up its scrutiny of foreign research firms in recent years. It has also beefed up regulations that more strictly control corporate and trade data flows. Earlier, in 2021, Chinese police raided a foreign auditing firm working on investigations related to China's western Xinjiang region, where the United Nations says China may have committed crimes against humanity. Later, authorities raided and questioned employees at a large marketing research office in Shanghai. The news of the release of the Mintz employees comes a day after an economic forum in Beijing, where Chinese officials promised better market access for foreign investors.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"ByKara Dennison, SPHR, CPRW, EC  ByKara Dennison, SPHR, CPRW, EC,  Contributor.  The Impact of New Tariff Policies and How to Prepare as a Job Seeker The U.S. economy has been rattled by tariff policies imposed by the new administration in recent months. There have been executive orders imposing tariffs on major partners, including Canada, Mexico, and China, including 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports and raising Chinese tariffs to 20%. These new orders have propelled effective U.S. tariff rates to levels not seen since the 1940s. This sharp pivot in trade strategy is poised to effect economic stability, which doesn\u2019t bode well for American businesses, the stock market, and consumers. Market analysts, Mark Reid, senior U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, and Carrie Freestone, a member of the macroeconomic analysis group state, wrote in a public report that \u201cif these tariffs are kept in place in the months ahead, we expect to see slowing growth, an uptick in inflation, and a hit to consumer and business confidence.\u201d What makes this moment particularly mind-boggling is the abrupt implementation and broad scope of these measures, introduced in the light of other national security concerns. The tariffs on Canada and Mexico create notable uncertainty for businesses dependent on North American trade. This uncertainty may influence hiring decisions, as companies historically hesitate to expand workforces or invest in production capacity when future trade conditions remain unpredictable. In 2024, the Census Bureau trade statistics showed that Canada and Mexico together accounted for 28% of all U.S. imports. With North American supply chains being so highly integrated, we stand to experience significant workforce adjustments as companies reassess their operational strategies. Reid and Freestone predicted that the manufacturing industry may be hit the hardest, stating, \u201cNorth America\u2019s manufacturing sector is highly integrated and would, therefore, be hit the hardest from tariffs on imports with key trading partners.\u201d The automotive industry is vulnerable due to its deeply integrated continental supply chain. Vehicles often cross borders multiple times during production, with U.S. intermediate products comprising a significant portion of imported goods from Canada and Mexico. Agriculture represents another sector likely to experience significant employment impacts, as Canada, Mexico, and China collectively account for approximately half of U.S. agricultural imports. At their core, tariffs are levies imposed on imported goods as they cross national borders. Unlike domestic taxes, such as income or property taxes, tariffs target foreign products entering the American market. The distinction between tariffs and other forms of taxation is significant. While conventional taxes primarily generate revenue, tariffs serve multiple economic and political objectives simultaneously. They can protect domestic industries by making imported alternatives less competitive, counteract what policymakers perceive as unfair trade practices, and provide leverage in international negotiations. This multifaceted nature makes tariffs particularly complex economic tools. Throughout American history, the purpose of tariffs has evolved considerably. In the nation\u2019s early years, they constituted a primary source of federal revenue. However, this role diminished significantly after establishing the federal tax income through the 16th Amendment in 1913. Following the Great Depression, tariffs transitioned from revenue generators to strategic instruments for economic policy and trade negotiations. The impact of tariffs ripples across the economy through various means. Most directly, they typically lead to higher consumer prices as companies pass along increased costs to consumers. This effect is particularly pronounced in sectors heavily reliant on imported components or raw materials. The U.S. automotive industry offers a compelling example, with its significant dependence on Canadian parts for manufacturing processes. The current tariff policies could substantially increase government revenue. Based on 2024 import data from Canada, Mexico, and China, the recently announced tariffs could generate approximately $300 billion in additional revenue, representing roughly one-third of the annual cost of extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. However, this projection assumes unchanged demand patterns, which is an unlikely scenario as consumers and businesses respond to higher prices by seeking alternatives from non-tariffed countries. The revenue increase will likely fall short of this estimate due to reduced demand and substitution effects. When implemented strategically, tariffs can support economic development by protecting key industries essential for a nation\u2019s future growth. The Biden administration\u2019s tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles are a prime example, as they were part of a comprehensive strategy to develop domestic EV production. According to economic experts, the President Donald Trump administration's tariff strategy utilizes presidential authority granted under specific U.S. laws that allow for tariff implementation without requiring congressional approval. The legal framework for these tariffs primarily relies on provisions designed for national security concerns or emergencies. The administration has invoked these provisions to justify the 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico and the increased 20% tariffs on Chinese goods. These measures address what the administration identifies as pressing security issues, including concerns about illegal immigration and the fentanyl crisis. The reimposition of tariffs on Canada and Mexico represents a significant development in North American trade relations. These changes come despite the previously established United States\u2013Canada\u2013Mexico Agreement, which Trump signed in 2020, highlighting a shift in the administration\u2019s trade priorities and approach to regional economic partnerships. Recent economic analysis provides a valuable perspective on potential employment outcomes. Following similar tariffs in 2018, U.S. steel manufacturers added approximately 1,000 new jobs as domestic production became more competitive. However, industries that use steel and aluminum as inputs, including auto parts, motorcycles, household appliances, and machinery manufacturers, experienced substantial adverse employment effects. By 2019, these downstream sectors had hired 75,000 fewer workers than projected without the tariffs, according to research from Harvard and the University of California, Davis. The non-durable goods sector also faces substantial exposure, particularly regarding Chinese imports. With China providing nearly $100 billion in U.S. imports of chemicals, pharmaceuticals, paper products, and textiles, companies in these industries may need to recalibrate their workforce needs as they adapt to new cost structures. In the face of significant economic shifts driven by new tariff policies, job seekers need strategic approaches to navigate a dynamic job market. Understanding which industries face the most significant disruption and which may benefit offers valuable guidance for career planning in 2025. Versatility has never been more valuable, especially now as the American market is in a transition. The World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs report emphasizes that in 2025, the skills in the highest demand will be analytical thinking, innovation, and active learning. Job seekers should consider investing now in these transferable skills that remain relevant across multiple sectors. Professionals with diverse skill sets typically experience shorter unemployment during industry disruptions than those with highly specialized, sector-specific abilities. While specific industries face contraction due to tariff impacts, others may expand as manufacturing returns to domestic markets. Job seekers should research which domestic industries benefit from reduced international competition. Companies producing substitutes for previously imported goods could grow, creating new employment opportunities. In addition, companies that help businesses adjust their supply chains, improve shipping and delivery systems, or navigate new trade rules often hire more workers when tariff policies change. Tariff impacts often vary significantly by region based on local industry concentrations. Job seekers willing to relocate may dramatically find better opportunities in areas less affected by specific tariff measures or regions benefiting from manufacturing reshoring. For instance, some metropolitan areas are experiencing growth in manufacturing employment despite broader sectoral challenges, creating geographic pockets of opportunity. The gig economy and contract work offer ways to build financial resilience during sector-specific disruptions. Developing secondary income streams through freelance projects, consulting, or platform-based work provides a financial buffer while pursuing long-term career opportunities. The only thing for certain is that change is inevitable. When it comes to being a job seeker in an unpredictable economy, especially one where tariff changes are imminent, it\u2019s imperative to keep your skill set sharp, your income sources diversified, and your goals flexible. Those who approach their search with resiliency and an opportunistic mindset are the ones that thrive.","label":0}

The most notable gainers were the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d big American technology stocks, including a near 12% surge for troubled EV maker Tesla. Trump is referring to the April 2 rollout of his reciprocal tariffs as \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d though he continues to express flexibility in his tariff plans.

That\u2019s the result of an interim final rule issued this month that removes the requirement for U.S. companies to report beneficial ownership information to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Previously, reporting requirements applied to businesses created in the U.S. and foreign companies registered to do business in any U.S. state or Indian tribe. If finalized, the rule would exempt more than 99% of entities from reporting. Beretta CEO Pietro Gussalli Beretta For 14 generations, the Beretta family has sold firearms. While they\u2019re known for handguns and shotguns, current CEO Pietro Gussalli Beretta, a 15th-generation descendant of the Beretta founders, saw a more well-rounded future for the world\u2019s oldest gunmaker. Since becoming CEO in 1995, Pietro has helped remake the 499-year-old company\u2014which is still family-owned\u2014by scooping up firms making everything from rifles to luxury clothing. In 2022, for instance, Beretta purchased Ammotec, Europe\u2019s largest maker of ammunition and pyrotechnics, and added $600 million to their annual sales. It\u2019s now the world\u2019s largest firearms company with $1.7 billion in revenues in 2024. \u201cThe three legs of our business are hunters, soldiers and policemen. They need guns, clothing and optics,\u201d he says, referring to scopes and red dot sights designed to improve a firearm\u2019s aim. \u201cThe last piece we needed was ammunition. With this latest deal, we finally closed the circle.\u201d Before the acquisition, civilian sales accounted for 86% of the company\u2019s revenues, making it dependent on the whims of hunters and gun enthusiasts\u2014particularly in the U.S., the world\u2019s largest firearms market, which makes up 37% of Beretta\u2019s sales. When Covid-19 sent gun sales to American civilians surging, Beretta reaped the rewards, with its North American revenues increasing by 62% from 2019 to 2021. But Pietro knew that would not last forever. Beretta took advantage of that growth in the U.S. civilian market to build closer ties with military and police forces around the world, helping the company \u201crebalance,\u201d Pietro said. Now, defense and law enforcement sales make up 34% of Beretta Holding\u2019s revenues, up from just 14% four years ago. WHY IT MATTERS It\u2019s a smart time to bet on the military, Forbes\u2019 Giacomo Tognini writes. Defense spending by European countries hit a record $350 billion in 2024 as leaders sought to rearm following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. That\u2019s set to grow even further, after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a plan in March\u2014right after President Donald Trump said the U.S. would pause military aid to Ukraine\u2014to provide EU countries with $160 billion in loans to invest in their armed forces. MORE As Trump Makes Panama Canal Demands, Meet The Swiss Billionaire Who Bought Two Key Ports With BlackRock A number of factors have led more American workers to take on multiple jobs, from the rising cost of living to an increasingly competitive job market. In fact, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics recently reported that it sees the highest number of workers with multiple jobs since it began tracking the metric in 1994: 8.9 million: The number of Americans who now work multiple jobs 50.2%: The share of people holding multiple jobs in 2024 who have a college degree, up from 45.1% in 2019 34.1: The number of hours in an average workweek for employees on private nonfarm payrolls last month, down from 34.3 in February 2024, as some employers cut back on hours Student loan borrowers are in a difficult position, as the Trump Administration has taken a number of actions in the past months to upend repayment and loan forgiveness programs. Borrowers should take steps now to stay ahead of the shifting landscape, including periodically logging into their Department of Education account and downloading key records, saving month-by-month payment records from their loan servicer account, and even reviewing their credit reports for possible errors as a result of the recent disruptions.

This post was originally published on March 25 Bitcoin has surged over the last week as traders bet U.S. president Donald Trump could be pulling back from his threat of global trade tariffs (though fears are swirling over a new, mystery threat). Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes\u2019 CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can \"uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!\" The bitcoin price has added around 10% since its early March lows but remains well off its peak of almost $110,000 per bitcoin set in January despite a a White House official revealing how Trump could spur the bitcoin price higher. Now, as a BlackRock executive predicts a \u201cbig catalyst\u201d for bitcoin could be on the horizon, traders are braced for meme stock darling GameStop to make a bitcoin-related announcement when it reports fourth-quarter results after Tuesday\u2019s market close\u2014potentially following in the footsteps of Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex\u2014A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run U.S. president Donald Trump hosted bitcoin and crypto company executives, including Strategy's ... More Michael Saylor, at a White House bitcoin and crypto summit. Last month, GameStop received a proposal from Strive Asset Management recommending that the brick-and-mortar video game retailer convert its $5 billion in cash reserves into bitcoin, a move it claims would transform the company into the \"premier bitcoin treasury company in the gaming sector.\" Strive Asset Management chief executive Matt Cole told GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen that he \u201chas an incredible opportunity.\" \u201cLetter received,\u201d Cohen then posted to X. Just weeks earlier, Cohen set social media alight when he posted a picture of himself with Michael Saylor, the founder of software company turned acquisition vehicle Strategy. 03\/26 update: GameStop has followed through with teased plans to adopt bitcoin, aping Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy that\u2019s built up the world\u2019s biggest corporate stash of bitcoin\u2014with self-styled \u201cbitcoin historian\u201d Pete Rizzo telling traders to \u201cbuckle up.\u201d While GameStop has $4.75 billion in cash and said it plans to use some of this cash as well as future debt or equity issuances to buy bitcoin, it didn't commit to an amount, somewhat disappointing those who had hoped the company would reveal a firm bitcoin-buy. GameStop's \"investment policy permits investments in certain cryptocurrency assets, including bitcoin and U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoins, and if the company acquires bitcoin or U.S. dollar denominated stablecoins, the company will be exposed to certain risks associated with bitcoin or stablecoins, respectively,\" the company's fourth-quarter earnings report read. GameStop\u2019s stock has climbed almost 20% overnight after the announcement, though it remains well below the sky-high levels it reached in 2021. Meme stock traders, unofficially led by Keith \"Roaring Kitty\" Gill, helped send the stock price of companies, including GameStop and cinema chain AMC, to astronomical levels alongside cryptocurrencies like dogecoin. Traders are betting GameStop could become the next Strategy, which has seen its stock explode 3,000% since it started buying bitcoin in the summer of 2020. \"Welcome to team bitcoin, Ryan Cohen,\" Saylor posted to X along with the photo of their pair. That growing team includes Metaplanet and Semler Scientific, both of which have adopted so-called bitcoin treasury strategies. \u201cOverall, news about crypto initiatives could make GameStop stock even more susceptible to sharp movements,\" analysts at crypto payments platform B2BinPay, said in emailed comments.  \u201cIn the short term, this has already acted as a positive decision, as reflected in the company\u2019s stock growth, however, it also carries risks of volatility. Stablecoins, of course, won\u2019t carry those risks, but bitcoin can go both ways \u2014 offering potential for growth but also for a drop.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Local rights groups accuse military of carrying out attack as army spokesperson says civilians not targeted. Dozens of people have been killed in an air strike on a market in North Darfur in western Sudan, according to the United Nations and local rights groups. Stephane Dujarric, spokesperson for the UN secretary-general, said on Tuesday that \u201cdozens\u201d of casualties were reported after the attack late on Monday on a market in the town of Tora, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) northwest of el-Fasher city.     Emergency Lawyers, a pro-democracy network which has been documenting abuses by both sides in Sudan\u2019s nearly two-year civil war, said on X that \u201chundreds\u201d of civilians were killed and dozens of others were wounded in the attack on the town of Tora. It blamed the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) for the attack. \u201cThis deliberate targeting of civilians constitutes a systematic war crime and a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law,\u201d said the lawyers\u2019 network. Nabil Abdullah, a spokesperson for the Sudanese military, told The Associated Press news agency that civilians had not been targeted, claiming that the allegations were \u201cincorrect\u201d and are raised whenever the army exercises its \u201cconstitutional and legal right to deal with hostile targets\u201d. Al Jazeera could not independently verify the death toll. Local rights group Darfur Victims Support shared a video on social media that appeared to show charred bodies strewn across the ground. It accused the military of carrying out an air strike. The attack follows two other deadly strikes on civilians since the military retook the presidential palace in central Khartoum from the rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) last week.      On Monday, Emergency Lawyers accused the RSF of shelling a mosque in the East Nile district of Khartoum, killing at least five people and injuring dozens of others as they conducted their evening prayers. On Sunday, the RSF also pounded Omdurman, Khartoum\u2019s twin city, killing three civilians in what witnesses described as some of the heaviest bombardments in recent months. Sudanese government forces have recently made advances in the conflict with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), seizing strategically important areas in the east of the country, including large parts of the capital, Khartoum. The RSF maintains control over much of the country\u2019s western region, and Darfur in particular, where it is working to establish its own government along with allies. Human rights organisations accuse both sides of serious human rights violations, such as sexual violence and the arbitrary shooting of civilians. The conflict has caused the world\u2019s largest refugee crisis, with 12.9 million people displaced since it began in April 2023, according to the United Nations.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  PLTR Stock  Palantir Technologies stock (NASDAQ:PLTR) price surged 6% on Monday, March 24, following reports that the Trump administration might refrain from imposing sector-specific tariffs on April 2. [1]    At its current level of $97, PLTR stock appears attractive yet volatile. We believe the company\u2019s strong operating performance and financial condition offer little cause for fundamental concern, which contributes to its attractiveness. However, its extremely high valuation makes it particularly sensitive to negative developments. Our analysis, comparing PLTR\u2019s valuation to its operating performance and financial health across Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience, confirms its very strong underlying fundamentals, as discussed further below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, PLTR stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. Palantir Technologies' Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Palantir Technologies' profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Palantir Technologies' balance sheet looks very strong. PLTR stock has seen an impact that was worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession?

PLTR stock\u2019s lofty valuations can also be attributed to its success with AI-driven tools and significant government contract wins over the last year. There is also optimism surrounding the Donald Trump-led Republican administration, which is expected to increase federal spending on national security and immigration, driving demand for Palantir\u2019s software tools.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"AMD\u2019s latest high-end graphics card, the Radeon RX 9070 XT, is proving to be a massive hit. AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su confirmed in an interview with Asus\u2019 China Manager, Tony Yu that that sales of the RX 9070 XT have skyrocketed, outpacing its predecessor by ten times. This overwhelming demand has exceeded initial projections, forcing AMD to ramp up production to ensure a steady supply. Launched as part of the RDNA 4 lineup, the Radeon RX 9070 XT was positioned as a direct competitor to Nvidia\u2019s mid-to-high-end offerings, promising strong performance at an aggressive price point. The reception has been overwhelmingly positive, with both enthusiasts and mainstream gamers flocking to purchase the card. Retailers have reported frequent stock shortages, reflecting the intense demand for AMD\u2019s latest GPU. Dr. Su acknowledged the supply constraints, stating that AMD is working closely with manufacturing partners to increase production. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of the team (working) on RDNA 4. When we do a new architectural generation, we have to decide its primary characteristics many years in advance, and for RDNA 4, what we really wanted to do is bring the best gaming capability to a very, let\u2019s call it good price point, so that we could get more gamers to have access to this technology.\u201d Su also added that \u201cThe 9070 XT has been a fantastic success, actually it is the number one selling (GPU) for all of the AMD Radeon generations, for first week sales by far, 10 times the previous generations. We are really excited about it, and we are increasing the manufacturing so more gamers can have access to it.\u201d  The GPU\u2019s success is likely attributed to its balance of performance, efficiency, and pricing. With RDNA 4\u2019s architectural improvements, the RX 9070 XT offers gains in both rasterization and ray tracing performance, making it a compelling option for high-resolution gaming. The card\u2019s pricing, which undercuts Nvidia\u2019s competing models while delivering similar or better performance, has also played a crucial role in its popularity. It will be interesting to see AMD\u2019s ability to maintain stock levels in the coming months, as it will determine whether the RX 9070 XT can sustain its momentum. The company\u2019s efforts to ramp up production indicate a strong commitment to keeping up with demand, avoiding the severe shortages that have plagued almost every GPU launch. With AMD\u2019s CEO confirming the GPU\u2019s unprecedented sales success and ongoing supply improvements, the Radeon RX 9070 XT is well on its way to becoming one of the company\u2019s best-selling graphics cards to date. For gamers looking to upgrade, the increasing availability of the RX 9070 XT should make it easier to get their hands on AMD\u2019s latest powerhouse. AMD is joining the battle against some of Nvidia's best graphics cards. The RX 9070 XT and its non-XT counterpart should now (hopefully) start flooding the shelves, and gamers are hoping to see them at their recommended list price (MSRP). Unfortunately, some models may cost up to $250 more from the get-go, which is similar to all of Nvidia's recent RTX 50-series releases where the GPUs cost much more than they should. Although the cards aren't technically up for sale just yet,\u00a0Best Buy seems to have plenty of RX 9070 XT and non-XT models listed -- they're just marked as \"coming soon.\" I know, I know we're all hopped up about the RX 9070 XT and 9070 launch -- I know I am. But looking beyond the potential big win AMD is on for with its first RDNA4 graphics cards, I'm also particularly excited about the potential for the rumored 9060 XT. Not because it'll be cheaper again -- it will be -- but because it might have up to 16GB of VRAM. That's going to wreck Nvidia's long-term second-hand card market, which could have a much greater impact on AMD's market share over the long term. It's all just rumors for now, and some of my colleagues are much less excited by this than I am, but I think there's some real potential here for this little card to be a game changer. Hitting the VRAM wall Video memory, or VRAM, has been a front-and centre feature of graphics card spec sheets for generations, but it's started to matter a lot more in recent years. While flagship graphics cards have exploded in their VRAM quantities, with the 5090 now offering 32GB, most mainstream cards have been getting by with less. It was only a couple of generations ago that the flagship RTX 3080 only had 10GB of VRAM, and outside of the top few models, you'll still see 12GB, 10GB, or even 8GB. Component companies are constantly upgrading their protocols and AMD is no different. The brand, known for its graphics cards, is transitioning its latest 9000 series GPUs to the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware standard. This means shifting away from the pre-boot BIOS setup that has been the customary way of performing various system tasks for many years. PC World noted that many computer enthusiasts may believe that UEFI and pre-boot BIOS are interchangeable. However, AMD detailed in support documentation that it is moving forward with UEFI as its sole firmware standard for graphics cards including the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT, for several reasons. These include improved security, interoperability for different interfaces, swift firmware updates, support for large hard drives, support for new PC hardware, Windows Secure Boot compatibility, as well as faster shutdown, startup, sleep, and resume times. \r Please enable Javascript to view this content  Upgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Qualcomm could drop the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 SoC this April.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  A new rumor claims that Qualcomm might scrap the \"Elite\" branding for its next chipset and go with Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 instead. According to leaker Digital Chat Station on Weibo, Qualcomm is gearing up to introduce the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 next month (via Notebookcheck). We\u2019ve already got some early specs floating around thanks to recent leaks, giving us a sneak peek at what this chip is packing under the hood. Keeping up with Qualcomm\u2019s chip lineup isn\u2019t easy, but the flagship series is a bit more straightforward. Qualcomm typically launches a top-tier SoC along with an \u201cs\u201d variant for budget-friendly flagships each year. With the Snapdragon 8 Elite getting some pretty positive market feedback, all eyes are now on the upcoming sub-flagship chipset. Contrary to earlier speculations, DCS says Qualcomm is ditching the Snapdragon 8s Elite name in favor of Snapdragon 8s Gen 4. The name change likely comes down to architecture. Unlike the Snapdragon 8 Elite with Qualcomm\u2019s custom Oryon cores, the the 8s Gen 4 is sticking with off-the-shelf ARM designs. According to DCS, the chip, designed as SN8735, will pack a 3.21GHz Cortex-X4 Prime Core, backed by three 3.01GHz Cortex-A720 cores and two 2.80GHz Cortex-A720 cores for heavy lifting. For better efficiency, it's expected to also include two 2.02GHz Cortex-A720 cores. On the graphics front, the new chip is expected to rock an Adreno 825 GPU. They're from the same next-gen family, but leaks suggest Qualcomm might be trimming down the core size a bit. This means you'll still get great mobile gaming performance; just don't expect it to quite match the absolute top-tier 8 Elite's graphical muscle. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android In a separate Weibo post, the leaker says the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 will use the same ISP as the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Plus, at least four Android phones are already in the works with this chip, including the Redmi Turbo 4 Pro, iQOO Z10 Turbo Pro, Xiaomi Civi 5 Pro, and Oppo K13 Pro. Reports suggest Qualcomm will launch the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 in April. Jay Bonggolto always keeps a nose for news.

According to ETNews, the Korean OEM is working on launching its first pair of XR smart glasses dubbed Project \"HAEAN\" which loosely translates to the sea coast or seashore according to Google Translate. According to the publication, the company is working on finalizing what these glasses will set out to do. Much like the XR headset, it could be powered by Galaxy AI, and will be much smaller than the head-mounted XR gear. \"They display information or images on the glasses like the lenses of glasses and transmit sound from the frame,\" the publication added. These glasses will likely be pitted against Meta's RayBan smart glasses, which can be worn outdoors and interact with the surroundings, possibly with the help of AI. Previous leaks indicated that they could weigh around 50 grams, have multiple cameras, and be coupled with the ability to make payments and respond to gestures and facial recognition. It is also claimed that these glasses could carry a Qualcomm chipset, and an NXP chip will be used as the auxiliary processing unit. The device could allegedly have a 12 MP camera with a Sony IMX681 CMOS image sensor. SamMobile indicated that these mixed reality glasses will have a \"155mAh battery Google's Gemini LLM will be installed on the device to provide AI features.\"  ETnews adds that Samsung is making sure that these glasses are comfortable to wear and is \"putting a lot of effort into a design tailored to the human body.\" Last year, Samsung even trademarked its smart glasses at the Intellectual Property Office in the U.K. It was filed under the \u201cVirtual reality headsets; Augmented reality headsets; Headphones; Smartphones; Smart glasses\u201d categories. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android An industry insider to ETnews, \u201cWith Apple\u2019s Vision Pro already on the market, Samsung\u2019s focus will be on providing a more advanced user experience.\u201d While we don't know when these XR glasses could see the light of day, the publication very confidently says that it will be launched alongside the XR headset which is expected to launch later this year, after Samsung showed it off more vividly at the MWC 2025.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Business Insider Edition  Boeing is set to develop the US Air Force's highly anticipated sixth-generation stealth fighter, poised to replace the F-22 Raptor and play a leading role in the Air Force's future fleet.          The sixth-generation combat aircraft is a central component of the Air Force's secretive and costly Next Generation Air Dominance, which seeks to fly the future fighter, designated the F-47, alongside autonomous drone wingmen known as Collaborative Combat Aircraft.               Though never officially confirmed, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman competed for the $20 billion contract. Northrop Grumman dropped out of the running in 2023, leaving Boeing to battle it out with Lockheed Martin's dominance of the stealth fighter force.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Business Insider Edition  For the past 20 years, the Toyota Tacoma has been the best-selling small pickup truck in the US, outselling rivals such as the Nissan Frontier and Ford Ranger.          The current fourth generation debuted in 2024 with more power and an almost overwhelming amount of new tech.               The Mexican-made pickup is also the first Tacoma to be offered with a four-cylinder hybrid powertrain instead of the traditional V6. It's a much-welcome upgrade, but I fear it risks losing what made the truck so special: no-nonsense reliability at a relatively low price.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Business Insider Edition  Americans aren't feeling great about the economy, and it's translating to a weaker outlook for spending.          That isn't good news for the stock market, and Wall Street is eyeing the risk of weaker corporate earnings as consumers pull back.       Consumer Confidence clocked in at 92.9 in March, its lowest level since 2021, according to the Conference Board's latest survey.               The Conference Board's Expectations Index, which reflects how consumers feel about their income, business conditions, and the job market, also fell to a reading of 65.2. It's the most pessimistic consumers have been about the economy in 12 years, and well below the key threshold of 80, which has historically been associated with a recession, the Conference Board said.               Consumers feeling dour about the economy is a real risk to the market \u2014 particularly if Americans start to pull back on spending, Wall Street forecasters say.               UBS Global Research said weaker consumer spending was one factor that played into its bear case for the stock market. In a note last week, strategists said they saw the S&P 500 extending its correction to 5,300. After stocks saw a slight rebound on Monday, that implies the benchmark index could drop 8% from current levels.               Meanwhile, 12-month forward earnings growth expectations in the US could drop as low as 6%, the firm estimated, down from 12% currently.               \"Our main contention over the past 6m has been that the US economy will look less exceptional as consumer spending cools and policy uncertainty prevents producers' animal spirits from translating into actual capex,\" strategists wrote.               The impact of slower spending expectations is already starting to have an impact on the market. Earlier this month, shares of airlines and retailers, like Kohl's, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Delta Airlines, tumbled on growing fears of a consumer slowdown.               Consumer discretionary stocks in the S&P 500 are down 9% from the start of the year, compared to the overall benchmark index, which is down by about 2% year-to-date.               \"The S&P 500 basket of stocks for consumer discretionary companies has declined significantly in recent weeks, suggesting that investors are starting to worry about future consumer spending on big-ticket items such as cars, washing machines, and mobile phones,\" Torsten Slk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, wrote last week.               Companies have also signaled that the outlook isn't getting any better. Economist David Rosenberg wrote in a note last week that 70% of companies that reported earnings for the first quarter had a negative outlook due to uncertainty surrounding trade policy and tariffs.               \"US equity futures are flashing red as corporate guidances continues to deteriorate,\" Rosenberg wrote.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"ByBrendan Ahern  ByBrendan Ahern,  Senior Contributor.  CLN Online video platform and social media company Kuaishou Technology (1024 HK) reported Q4 and 2024 financial results after the Hong Kong market closed overnight. The company\u2019s full-year 2024 results were strong as revenue rose by +12% year-over-year (YoY), adjusted net income rose by +72%, and adjusted EPS rose by +74%, though Q4 numbers were a touch light. The press release and conference call were all about AI integration, as \u201cusers can now generate premium videos with a simple prompt or picture\u201d using the company\u2019s Kling AI 1.6 model. In the Q&A portion of the call, an analyst noted that the government mentioned its artificial intelligence model at the National People\u2019s Congress and CPPCC press conference, which is interesting. The Q&A was all about AI, though, and the company\u2019s ecommerce efforts are doing well as more KOLs (key opinion leaders) sell goods using videos. Asian stocks were higher today except for Hong Kong, following President Donald Trump\u2019s statement that countries that import Venezuelan oil could be hit with 25% tariffs, which is an unsubtle code for China. Driving to the train station this morning, the radio reminded me that markets are considering tariff talk, \u201cBad Medicine,\u201d Bon Jovi\u2019s 1988 hit, as U.S. futures roll over Tuesday morning. I still believe the Art of the Deal might provide a better-than-expected tariff outcome, which would be a positive catalyst for Mainland China and Hong Kong stocks, in my opinion. Hong Kong\u2019s sell-off was driven by growth stocks and recent outperformers, as headlines warn of a \u201ccorrection.\" As we mentioned Monday, the Hang Seng Index hit a 52-week high last Wednesday, and the Hang Seng Tech Index did the same last Tuesday. Everything you\u2019ll see today speaks to the \u201ccorrection\u201d following a strong +20% year-to-date (YTD) move in the Hang Seng Index and the Hang Seng Tech Index, which is up +28% YTD. However, this rally didn\u2019t start in mid-January 2025 with the DeepSeek news. Rather, it started in mid-January of 2024, when the final China bull was slaughtered in the final derivative-induced meltdown. From Jan. 22, 2024, to today\u2019s close, the Hang Seng is up +64%, and the Hang Seng Tech Index is up +83%. The S&P and Nasdaq 100 are up 20.83% and +17.57%, respectively, from Jan. 22, 2024 to Monday\u2019s close. There were a few culprits for today\u2019s Hong Kong fall. It is worth noting Shanghai and Shenzhen were flat and barely off, though they\u2019ve not risen nearly as much year-to-date (YTD), but still up +26% and 29%, respectively, since Jan. 22, 2024. Xiaomi (1810 HK) fell by -6.32% after announcing Monday that it will raise $5.3 billion by selling 750 million shares. It is worth noting that Mainland investors bought a massive HKD 8.48 billion worth of Xiaomi stock via Southbound Stock Connect. Sunny Optical (2382 HK) fell by -10.05% despite announcing annual revenue growth of +20.9% YoY and net profit growth of +145%. As Bloomberg reports, \u201cthe company warned of market restructuring due to a capacity glut.\u201d BYD (1211 HK and 002594 CH) fell by -3.52% in Hong Kong and by -1.54% in Mainland China despite great results IMO. Alibaba (9988 HK) fell by -3.84% after Joe Tsai, during an interview at the HSBC Global Investment Summit, stated that the massive data center buildout might not be \u201centirely necessary.\u201d However, Tsai pointed out the importance of the signaling from President Xi's meeting with tech entrepreneurs. Overall, it was a rough night, but corrections are healthy and to be expected. Mainland China held up much better except for technology hardware, semiconductors, automobiles, and computer stocks. Following Monday\u2019s Reuters report of Vice Premier He Lifeng meeting with the CEOs of Apple, Pfizer, Mastercard, Cargill, Eli Lilly, Medtronic, and Corning, today he met with Blackstone Chairman Stephen Schwarzman. Commerce Minister Wang Wentao was busy meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook, Qualcomm CEO An Meng and Boeing\u2019s Brendan Nelson. Amazing how well business people get along with one another! I recently caught famed tech investors Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner\u2019s podcast titled BG\u00b2, which I recommend. The March 1st release reviewed X\/Twitter\u2019s Grok 3, China, DOGE, and public market pullback. They spoke about the Biden administration\u2019s failed efforts to slow\/harm China\u2019s technological advance through export controls. They articulated viewing the world in a \u201cyou win, I lose\u201d mentality made no sense to them though all investors hate capital controls. Take a listen for yourself. Chart The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes fell -2.35% and -3.82%, respectively, on volume that increased +22% from yesterday, which is 172% of the 1-year average. Eighty-nine stocks advanced, while 390 stocks declined. Main Board short turnover increased by +4.86% from yesterday, which is 166% of the 1-year average, as 15% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers\u2019 ETF hedging). Value and large capitalization stocks \u201coutperformed,\u201d i.e., fell less than growth and small capitalization stocks. Materials gained +0.12% and constituted the only positive sector, as Information Technology fell by -6.09%, Consumer Discretionary fell by -3.79%, and Communication Services fell by -2.15%, making up the worst-performing sectors. The top-performing subsectors were national defense, real estate investment trusts and nonferrous metals. Meanwhile, technology hardware, consumer durables, apparel, and automobiles were among the worst-performing subsectors. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were 3x pre-stimulus levels, as Mainland investors bought a net $1.8 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, including Xiaomi, which was a very large net buy, and Meituan, which was a moderate net buy.

Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board diverged to close flat, -0.57% and -1.36%, respectively, on volume that decreased -13% from Monday, which is 105% of the 1-year average. 2,195 stocks advanced, while 2,795 stocks declined.

Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Information Technology, down -1.72 %; Consumer Discretionary, down -0.82%; and Communication Services, down -0.72%. The top-performing subsectors included coal and fertilizers. Meanwhile, internet services, computer hardware, and communication equipment were among the worst-performing subsectors.

I'm talking about its Nemesis system, a mechanic that means certain enemies you face off against remember you and your actions as they get stronger, maybe even calling out certain occasions where they killed you. It's a lovely bit of design that, as it turns out, kind of just exists to stop the second hand game market.\r  \r How so? Well, former Warner Bros Games exec Laura Fryer recently explained as such in a recent YouTube video of hers. According to Fryer, while working with Monolith she explained to them that a problem Rocksteady's Batman: Arkham Asylum faced in terms of sales was that people were buying the game, playing it, returning it, which would then of course be sold second hand. This meant Rocksteady, and subsequently Warner Bros., weren't getting as much money as they'd like.\r  \r \"They were only getting paid for the first copy sold,\" Fryer explained. \"They lost millions of dollars.\" Sure, multiplayer games were growing in popularity at the time, but as Fryer put it, \"How do we create a single-player game that is so compelling, that people keep the disc in their library forever?\"\r  \r She went on to explain that Monolith's game engine couldn't really do a big open world like GTA, and they apparently weren't interested in multiplayer. So, they needed a hook. \"And this thinking is what led to the Nemesis system, arguably one of the most creative and coolest game features in recent memory.\"\r  \r The Nemesis system is a great one, I put hours into Shadow of Mordor because of it despite not being all that much of a Lord of the Rings fan, but frustratingly it is patented until 2036, so you won't be seeing it in any other game any time soon. Especially because Warner Bros. closed Monolith last month, cancelling its Wonder Woman game (which was set to feature the system) along with it.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Here's a fascinating--and market-specific--solution for dealing with small spaces. Japanese manufacturer Lixil makes this Bathtope, a fabric bathtub that can be tucked away when not needed.            The idea is that you can deploy it as desired within a shower, provided it's large enough. This shower space could conceivably be used, the manufacturer suggests, as a place to store and water plants, which can then be removed for showering or bathing. (This amount of effort may sound far-fetched to Americans, but in Japan, workarounds for living in small spaces is common.)         Because the bath is fabric, it conforms to the user's body, and requires less water per bath\u201426% less, the company says--than a conventional tub.     The Bathtope is a Japanese-market-only product. Enter a caption (optional)  Those hooks better be sturdy. Filling with a typical shower fitting would be kinda slow and emptying would be slower (unless you did not mind flooding the entire room).

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Ageing design, rising competition and controversy around Elon Musk seen driving reversal of Tesla sales. Tesla\u2019s European sales dropped 49 percent year on year in January and February, despite rising registrations of electric vehicles (EVs). New Tesla registrations in the European Union fell to 19,046 in the first two months of the year from at least 37,000 in the same period of 2024, according to a report published by the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association (ACEA) on Tuesday. The lobby group noted that the United States-based EV manufacturer is struggling to keep pace with competitors while the political controversy around owner Elon Musk is also affecting sales. Tesla\u2019s struggles saw Tesla\u2019s market share drop from 2.1 percent to 1.1 percent. In February alone, Tesla registrations commanded 1.8 percent of the total market and 10.3 percent of the Battery-Electric Vehicle market, down from 2.8 percent and 21.6 percent, respectively, in the same month last year. The US company\u2019s ageing models are viewed as one reason for the dip, as traditional automakers and new Chinese manufacturers launch newer and cheaper EVs. Meanwhile, CEO Elon Musk has been criticised for offering vocal and financial support to far-right groups in Europe. His role in the administration of President Donald Trump, who is threatening Europe with trade wars, is also viewed as a factor. Growing boycott movements aimed at Tesla have risen up in the EU, as well as at home, with Tesla dealerships vandalised, and the company\u2019s stock price dropping sharply. EV sales in the EU grew by 28.4 percent in January and February, but there is concern that the segment needs more support. ACEA Director General Sigrid de Vries said the sales figures show that demand for TVs \u201cremains below the level needed for the transition to zero-emission mobility to progress\u201d. He called for tax and purchasing incentives for consumers and further investment in recharging stations. Brussels is, meanwhile, preparing to ease emission reduction targets. Still, Hybrid-electric vehicles remained the most significant market segment in the first two months of the year, rising to 594,059 registrations, or a 35.2 percent market share. Electrified vehicles \u2013 either battery-electric (BEV), hybrid (HEV) or plug-in hybrids (PHEV) \u2013 sold in the bloc accounted for 58.4 percent of all passenger car registrations in February, up from 48.2 percent a year earlier.

Consumer attitudes worsened in March as President Donald Trump's tariffs set off a market rout and warnings of a possible recession, The Conference Board survey data on Tuesday showed. Sentiment worsened more than economists expected. The gauge marked the fourth consecutive month of worsening attitudes, dropping to its lowest level since 2021. Expectations of future income had held steady even during the recent decline in overall sentiment, but that measure of anticipated income fell notably in March, The Conference Board said. Income fears suggest \"worries about the economy and labor market have started to spread into consumers\u2019 assessments of their personal situations,\" Stephanie Guichard, senior economist of global indicators at The Conference Board, said in a statement. The fresh data on consumer sentiment arrives a week before the onset of additional U.S. tariffs, indicating potential fear of further escalation in an ongoing global trade war. Trump has repeatedly referred to April 2 as \"liberation day,\" saying a wide-ranging slate of reciprocal tariffs would rebalance U.S. trade relationships. Trump\u2019s plan for reciprocal tariffs next week, however, is expected to be more targeted and narrower than he previously vowed, though the plan remains under discussion, sources told ABC News on Monday. The administration is focused on trading partners who have major trade imbalances with the U.S., the sources said. The news of a potentially softer approach to forthcoming tariffs rallied U.S. stocks on Monday, recovering some of the losses suffered earlier this month. The major stock indexes moved slightly higher in early trading on Tuesday. Consumer sentiment appears to align with dampening expectations at the Federal Reserve. Last week, the Fed predicted weaker year-end economic growth and higher inflation than it had in a December forecast. Speaking at a press conference in Washington, D.C., last Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell faulted tariffs for a \"good part\" of recent inflation. By some key measures, however, the economy remains in solid shape. A recent jobs report showed steady hiring last month and a historically low unemployment rate. Inflation stands well below a peak attained in 2022, though price increases register nearly a percentage point higher than the Fed's goal of 2%. Still, recession fears are mounting on Wall Street as businesses and consumers weather the trade war. Goldman Sachs earlier this month hiked its odds of a recession from 15% to 20%. Moody's Analytics pegged the chances of a recession over the next year at 35%. Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, could weaken if shopper sentiment sours, Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at eToro, told ABC News in a statement. \"A cut-back in spending has the potential to reverberate throughout the economy,\" Kenwell said. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":1}
{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"ByDennis Mitzner  ByDennis Mitzner,  Contributor.  Retailers are bracing for another wave of supply chain disruption as new tariffs threaten to drive up costs across industries. With global trade policies shifting, companies are scrambling to assess the impact on their operations, margins, and ultimately, consumers' wallets. The question now isn\u2019t just how much prices will rise\u2014but how businesses can adapt. Technology is playing a crucial role in this transformation. As Peter Tardelli, Senior Sales Strategy Expert at Palantir, recently highlighted, advanced supply chain solutions enable retailers to rapidly integrate enterprise-wide data, assess country- and tariff-based risks, and automate critical sourcing decisions. By leveraging tools that map product cost journeys across enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, warehouses, human resources, and delivery networks, companies can pinpoint high-risk stock-keeping units (SKUs) and proactively adjust their strategies to maintain profitability. But even with these tools, the challenges are steep. Businesses must decide whether to absorb higher costs, pass them on to consumers, or find alternative solutions. Retailers are adjusting sourcing strategies to mitigate risks by exploring partnerships in low-tariff regions and nearshoring operations. Predictive modeling has proven invaluable in this process\u2014retailers are using AI-generated scenarios to preemptively secure inventory and optimize pricing strategies. Real-time simulation of multiple tariff scenarios is now a competitive necessity. AI-powered analytics can rapidly analyze country-specific duties, evaluate alternative vendors, and automate pricing adjustments to keep businesses agile. For retailers, this enables cost savings, supplier diversification, and sustained price competitiveness amid geopolitical changes. \u201cWhen tariffs are imposed or adjusted, online retailers must quickly assess which SKUs are most at risk and strategize to manage cost fluctuations without impacting customer experience. Brands need to identify affected products based on country of origin and historical sales data. High-risk products\u2014those with high return rates, low resale value, or complex reverse logistics\u2014require careful evaluation to minimize financial exposure. Once identified, brands can explore alternative sourcing strategies or adjust return policies to mitigate rising costs. However, clear and transparent communication is essential to maintaining consumer trust,\u201d says Kristen Kelly, SVP of Product at Loop Returns. Predictive modeling and AI-powered scenario planning are also helping businesses optimize supply chain efficiency. By identifying the most cost-effective shipping routes, balancing inventory, and selecting the most affordable labels, companies can minimize logistics expenses and ensure product availability despite tariff challenges. \u201cIn addition, reverse logistics companies use historical returns data and forecasting models to anticipate which orders might result in returns,\u201d Kelly adds. \u201cThis helps e-commerce merchants make better merchandising and inventory decisions while also improving the shopping experience to reduce returns in the first place. Predictive analytics can even estimate the resale value of returned products, ensuring businesses can recover as much value as possible and avoid unnecessary losses.\u201d From a policy standpoint, future tariffs will likely reflect ongoing geopolitical tensions and trade realignments. Retailers should prepare for volatility by building flexible supplier networks and leveraging trade incentives where available. Policymakers can reduce uncertainty by negotiating stable trade agreements and providing transparent tariff guidelines. Collaboration between governments and businesses is key to strengthening supply chain resilience\u2014joint investment in infrastructure, trade facilitation, and real-time data sharing will help businesses navigate these disruptions more effectively. \u201cRetailers must take a proactive approach,\u201d says Carla Ni\u00f1a Pornelos, General Manager of Wardnasse. \u201cBy leveraging AI, predictive analytics, and strong supplier relationships, companies can mitigate risk, optimize costs, and maintain a competitive edge in a rapidly changing trade environment.\u201d International shipping is gradually stabilizing, but delays often stem from inefficiencies within e-commerce retailers' systems. A lack of accurate inventory management can prevent products from being available at the right place and time. Poor data quality leads to bottlenecks in order fulfillment, making it essential for retailers to have real-time visibility into stock levels\u2014whether fulfilling orders from a warehouse or a physical store. \u201cErrors in that data cause delays, because precious delivery time is now spent trying to locate the stock. Retailers can address this through digital enablement \u2013 by getting their systems to talk to each other and improving business intelligence. E-commerce retailers should always be asking: \u201cWhat orders am I going to receive and how am I going to fulfill them?\u201d Data-driven systems are part of the solution. Demand signaling, or predictive analytics, refers to AI that predicts future inventory demand. Sophisticated insight into what demand is coming helps retailers have the products ready to dispatch when the orders come in,\u201d says Travis Erridge, co-founder and CEO of TMX Transform. As trade policies continue to evolve, retailers must remain agile in navigating supply chain challenges. By leveraging AI-driven analytics, predictive modeling, and strategic supplier diversification, businesses can mitigate risks and adapt to tariff fluctuations. Collaboration between policymakers and industry leaders will be key to fostering a resilient trade environment, ensuring retailers can maintain profitability and competitiveness in an unpredictable global market.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Americans\u2019 short-term expectations for income, business and the job market also fell due to worries about tariffs and prices. Consumer confidence in the United States has continued its sharp 2025 decline as Americans\u2019 views about their financial futures slumped to a 12-year low, driven by rising anxiety over tariffs\u00a0and\u00a0inflation. The Conference Board reported on Tuesday that its consumer confidence index fell 7.2 points in March to 92.9, the fourth straight monthly decline and its lowest reading since January of 2021. The reading was short of analysts\u2019 expectations for a reading of 94.5, according to a survey by FactSet. The business group found that the measure of Americans\u2019 short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.6 points to 65.2. That\u2019s the lowest reading in 12 years and well below the threshold of 80, which The Conference Board says can signal a potential recession in the near future. The proportion of US consumers anticipating a recession remains at a nine-month high, the board reported. \u201cConsumers\u2019 optimism about future income \u2014 which had held up quite strongly in the past few months \u2014 largely vanished, suggesting worries about the economy and labour market have started to spread into consumers\u2019 assessments of their personal situations,\u201d said Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at The Conference Board. US President Donald Trump\u2019s on-and-off-again tariffs have been panned by economists for sowing confusion and uncertainty that they said was making it challenging for businesses to plan ahead, to the detriment of the economy. Trump on Monday indicated that not all of his threatened\u00a0duties would be imposed on April 2 and some countries may get breaks, but at the same time said tariffs on imported automobiles were coming soon. \u201cConsumers are rattled,\u201d said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. \u201cAt great personal risk, we will opine that the chaos in Washington has something to do with this. The decline in consumer sentiment since the November election can no longer be written off as a coincidence.\u201d The fourth straight monthly decline in confidence mirrored a similar deterioration earlier this month in the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment measure, which has also erased all the gains notched in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s election victory in November.      The Trump administration has largely played down the souring mood among Americans, saying it doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect what\u2019s happening in the actual economy. This argument is similar to what officials in former US President Joe Biden\u2019s administration said as high inflation suppressed consumer confidence without undermining growth. Yet some of the nation\u2019s biggest retailers, who have noted a shift in consumer behaviour, are telling a different story. Walmart has thrived with Americans trying to offset higher prices by seeking bargains. Late last month, however, the nation\u2019s largest retailer\u00a0slashed its profit forecast\u00a0for this year. Its sales outlook was also conservative and the company does not include the potential impact of tariffs in its expectations for 2025. Target\u2019s sales and profit slipped during the crucial holiday quarter, and the company predicted that there would be \u201cmeaningful pressure\u201d on its profits to start the year in part because of tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China. Macy\u2019s, Best Buy, Abercrombie & Fitch, Dollar General and others also have grown cautious about their expectations for 2025, with many citing \u201ceconomic uncertainty\u201d. The Conference Board\u2019s survey showed that purchasing plans for both homes and cars declined. However, in somewhat of a surprise given respondents\u2019 anxiety about the future, intentions to buy big-ticket items like appliances increased. The board said that could reflect a desire to buy before the tariffs kick in and price increases. While inflation has retreated from its highs during the post-pandemic rebound, it has remained above the Federal Reserve\u2019s two percent target. Those still-elevated prices, combined with the announced tariffs on many imported goods, have Americans feeling sour about spending as concerns about the economy mount. Consumers had appeared increasingly confident heading into the year-end holidays, and spent generously at the end of 2024. One month later, however, in January 2025, US retail sales fell sharply, though cold weather shared some of the blame. Earlier this month, the government reported that Americans stepped up their spending in February after the sharp early-year pullback, but only tepidly. The board reported Tuesday that consumers\u2019 view of current conditions decreased 3.6 points to 134.5. The consumer confidence index measures both Americans\u2019 assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months. Consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of US economic activity and is closely watched by economists for signs about how the American consumer is feeling.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Ripple Labs accomplished a significant market victory after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dismissed its lawsuit, leading to XRP gaining substantial market strength. Ripple secured a landmark victory in court, which validated their operations and established parameters that led to better market acceptability for cryptocurrencies across all regulatory bodies.\u200b The SEC initiated legal action against Ripple Labs in December 2020 because the company sold\u00a0XRP\u00a0without registering the tokens to a value of more than $1.3 billion. According to the SEC, XRP should be treated as a security, which would place regulatory restrictions on its operations. According to its position, Ripple maintained that XRP worked as a digital currency rather than a security. The court dispute has become the leading subject in classifications of digital wealth and cryptocurrency regulatory constructs.\u200b Executive Brad Garlinghouse revealed to the\u00a0media\u00a0that the SEC had withdrawn its appeal, thus ending the long-running lawsuit after four years of litigation. Garlinghouse released a video statement highlighting the vital victory Ripple and the entire crypto industry achieved through this withdrawal of legal action from the SEC. The CEO declared his happiness to announce that the lawsuit ended. \u200b The lawsuit dismissal immediately boosted XRP\u2019s market performance. XRP gained a 13% price increase after the court announcement, resulting in $2.56 as its highest value point. The market surge represents investors\u2019 new optimism because the legal challenges that restricted XRP\u2019s development growth are no longer present. The lawsuit\u2019s resolution showed growing\u00a0market interest\u00a0in XRP by producing elevated trading volumes.\u200b The resolution of the SEC\u2019s legal battle against Ripple brings substantial effects that influence the entire cryptocurrency sector. A legal precedent about digital asset classification emerged from this court decision. The court\u2019s decision that XRP is not a security might shape future regulations regarding other cryptocurrencies. Such a judicial disposition allows authorities to build better regulatory systems that classify various digital assets through their functional characteristics.\u200b The SEC\u2019s agreement to dismiss its lawsuit indicates a changing regulatory attitude regarding cryptocurrency management. During this administration, the government has shown signs of promoting innovative activities while creating defined regulatory standards that govern the crypto market. The regulatory shift can potentially make institutional investors join the crypto market, thus advancing its development alongside financial system integration.\u200b The agreement from the lawsuit settlement strongly affected how investors feel about their investments. The XRP market price increased after the announcement because investors regained their confidence following the legal ambiguities surrounding Ripple. The market-wide positive sentiment becomes evident through XRP\u2019s price increase because other cryptocurrencies also demonstrated enhanced value. \u200b After the lawsuit dismissal, Ripple faced fewer significant hurdles in its path, but the cryptocurrency market maintained high volatility levels. Market participants must remain conservative by performing profound market studies because legislative frameworks and market tendencies tend to alter swiftly.\u200b Removing legal obstacles allows Ripple to restart its business operations while pursuing strategic initiatives. Ripple can dedicate its resources to payment solution development and strategic partnerships thanks to the resolution of legal issues. The Company will now be able to progress toward discovering new markets and applications of XRP, which will maximize its adoption and practical value.\u200b The successful outcome of the lawsuit allowed Ripple to attract institutional investors who had abstained due to regulatory worries. Improving regulatory clarity will attract more investors to XRP, thus building its market liquidity and capitalization levels.\u200b With the SEC\u2019s latest lawsuit dismissal, Ripple faces new possibilities in the cryptocurrency industry, which impacts XRP value. Market trust in XRP experienced an immediate uptick because of this development, while the ruling sets a vital legal standard regarding digital assets that regulators may consider moving forward. Ripple\u2019s future growth remains strong due to eliminating legal disputes that allow the company to seize emerging possibilities while shaping the global financial industry\u2019s evolving structure. After the short-term price boost, this situation established a solid basis for Ripple to extend its cross-border payment and financial service capabilities. The use of XRP for quick, cost-effective international transfers will result in higher take-up among financial organizations following the legal disputes being settled. XRP stands to become a leading alternative payment network that offers better performance than traditional banking methods and has a status above other unregulated cryptocurrencies. This decision will have an impact on the whole cryptocurrency marketplace. The regulatory approval of Ripple gives hope to other blockchain projects and digital assets being assessed by authorities to develop more precise guidelines for the industry. The regulatory clearance allows increased industry investment and innovation, strengthening cryptocurrency\u2019s position in worldwide financial operations. Ripple\u2019s future success depends on its ability to successfully execute business plans to maintain its present market growth trajectory. The market closely monitors the company\u2019s strategic partnerships, new business progress, and institutional partnership opportunities. The successful exploitation of its legal triumph by Ripple could make XRP establish itself as a leading cryptocurrency by establishing a solid business market presence. The legal victory gives Ripple an advantage despite the challenges in the current regulatory environment and competition with other digital assets. The lawsuit\u2019s outcome guarantees XRP a brighter future because it enables superior market performance and expanded user adoption.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff announcement scheduled for April 2 is set to give the market a negative surprise, according to a Goldman Sachs (GS) economist. Trump administration officials have said initial duties are meant as a basis for talks \u2014 which incentivizes them to set high rates, Alec Phillips wrote in a note to clients. A recent survey shows market participants expect an initial 9 percent reciprocal tariff rate, but it may be double that level, he said. Stocks surged on Monday as the president said he may scale back the planned tariffs. The Nasdaq Composite index gained 2.3%, as all Magnificent 7 stocks climbed, the S&P 500 gained 1.8%, and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.4%, or almost 600 points. The reciprocal tariffs may stop short of his pledge to equalize with levels charged by foreign countries on U.S. goods, Trump told reporters. The administration may also delay duties on particular lines of goods. Despite the lowered pitch of Trump\u2019s rhetoric, the new duties are likely to cover almost all of U.S. trade, Phillips said. They could boost the U.S.\u2019s effective overall tariff rate by 10 percentage points, with a risk scenario of 15 percentage points. His prior actions have boosted the rate by 3 percentage points. Additional uncertainties include Trump\u2019s proposed 25% duties on countries that buy Venezuelan oil, his insistence that value added taxes (VATs) are discriminatory against U.S. goods, and the possibility that currency undervaluation could be included in the calculations. The U.S. dollar\u2019s strength makes most other currencies look undervalued. One bright spot: While the tariffs could be implemented immediately under the president\u2019s emergency authority, postponements in imposing duties on Mexico and Canada show that the administration is willing to delay. \u201cAs the countries targeted under a reciprocal tariff look likely to account for three times the amount of imports as Canada and Mexico, there is an even stronger argument for moving deliberately,\u201d Phillips wrote.

More Hershey Co., the No.1 candy producer in the U.S., is raising the price of its chocolate by 8 percent due to the rising cost of cocoa. This is the company's fist price increase in three years.  (Photo Illustration by Scott Olson\/Getty Images) Did you know corporate bankruptcies hit a 14-year high in 2024? Almost 700 companies filed for bankruptcy, and among them were big name companies like Red Lobster, Spirit Airlines, Big Lots, Party City and more. As Trump shakes up the global economic landscape, many business models look increasingly wobbly. I\u2019m not surprised to see many stocks plummet even if the company beat earnings expectations. For example, AI chipmaker Marvell Technology (MRVL) beat both revenue and EPS estimates, but its stock fell more than 18% on the day of earnings. Even beats aren\u2019t sending shares soaring anymore, as investors look past the meaningless EPS figures and weigh future economic uncertainty against already overvalued stock prices. Looking for a safe haven in this uncertain market? My firm has answers. I leverage my firm\u2019s superior fundamental data to bring truth to the markets. How? I calculate the real cash flows of businesses and deliver the truth about stock valuations. I scour my proprietary database to identify companies that not only generate real cash flows but also generate enough cash flows to easily cover their dividend payments. Growing dividends are a great way to protect a portfolio in uncertain times. Finding companies with the ability to grow their dividends can lead to a gold mine. That\u2019s exactly what my Dividend Growth Stocks Model Portfolio finds. The report below features one stock from this Model Portfolio. The Hershey Company (HSY) is the featured stock in the most recent Dividend Growth Model Portfolio. Hershey has grown revenue and net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) by 7% and 15% compounded annually, respectively, over the last five years. The company\u2019s NOPAT margin increased from 18% in 2019 to 25% in 2024, while invested capital turns fell from 1.0 to 0.9 over the same time. Rising NOPAT margins are enough to offset falling invested capital turns and drive return on invested capital (ROIC) from 17% in 2019 to 22% in 2024. Figure 1: Hershey\u2019s Revenue & NOPAT Since 2019 HSY Revenue & NOPAT Hershey has increased its regular, quarterly dividend from $0.72\/share in 1Q19 to $1.37\/share in 1Q25. The quarterly dividend, when annualized, equals $5.48\/share and provides a 3.1% dividend yield. More importantly, Hershey\u2019s cumulative free cash flow (FCF) easily exceeds its dividend payments. From 2019 through 2024, Hershey generated $6.7 billion (17% of current enterprise value) in FCF while paying $4.7 billion in dividends. See Figure 2. Figure 2: Hershey\u2019s FCF vs. Dividends Since 2019 HSY Dividends & FCF Companies with FCF well above dividend payments provide higher-quality dividend growth opportunities. On the other hand, dividends that exceed FCF cannot be trusted to grow or even be maintained. At its current price, Hershey has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 0.9. This ratio means the market expects Hershey\u2019s NOPAT to permanently fall 10% from current levels. This expectation seems overly pessimistic given that Hershey has grown NOPAT by 15% compounded annually and 11% compounded annually over the past five and ten years, respectively. Even if Hershey\u2019s: the stock would be worth $218\/share today \u2013 a 23% upside. See the math behind this reverse DCF scenario. In this scenario, Hershey\u2019s NOPAT would grow just 2% compounded annually through 2034. Add in Hershey\u2019s 3.1% dividend yield and a history of dividend growth, and it\u2019s clear why this stock is in February\u2019s Dividend Growth Stocks Model Portfolio. Below are specifics on the adjustments I make based on Robo-Analyst findings in Hershey Inc.\u2019s 10-K: Income Statement: I made over $850 million in adjustments with a net effect of removing over $550 million in non-operating expense. Balance Sheet: I made just over $6 billion in adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of over $3 billion. The most notable adjustment was for asset write downs. Valuation: I made over $6 billion in adjustments, with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by just under $5 billion. Apart from total debt, the most notable adjustment to shareholder value was for excess cash.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Big Pharma is expected to see big returns from its investment in a class of drugs made famous by Novo Nordisk\u2019s (NVO) popular diabetes drug Ozempic. Deloitte\u2019s annual report, Measuring the Return from Pharmaceutical Innovation, found that GLP-1 drugs could fuel significant returns on research and development investments made last year by major drugmakers. The consulting firm analyzed the projected internal rate of return for late-stage pipeline assets across the 20 leading pharma companies. On average, these companies forecast peak sales of $510 million per asset. But when GLP-1s are excluded, that figure drops sharply to $370 million. The internal rate of return for late-stage pipeline assets climbed from  5.9% in 2024, from 4.1% in 2023 \u2014 again driven in large part by GLP-1 drugs. Without them, returns would have declined, dipping to 3.8% in 2024 and 3.4% in 2023. This matters even more given that the report also found that the average cost to develop a drug for Big Pharma was $2.23 billion in 2024, up from $2.12 billion the year before. GLP-1 drugs mimic hormones that regulate  blood sugar and suppress appetite, making them highly sought after for treating obesity and Type 2 diabetes. The surging demand has propelled Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk into becoming the largest pharma companies in the world. Eli Lilly\u2019s weight-loss drug Zepbound generated $4.9 billion in annual revenue, while Novo Nordisk\u2019s rival treatment, Wegovy, reached roughly $8 billion in sales. Wall Street has taken notice. Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Zepbound in November 2023, Eli Lilly\u2019s stock has soared more than 40%, pushing its market capitalization past $750 billion. Novo Nordisk has seen an even steeper climb, with its stock rising over 76% since Wegovy\u2019s launch in 2021. With such massive returns, several companies \u2014 including Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, Pfizer, and Amgen\u00a0\u2014 are advancing next-generation GLP-1 drugs and investigating their potential for new uses, such as treating sleep apnea and improving heart health.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of Strategy (MSTR).Strategy (MSTR), the U.S. company that's made buying bitcoin (BTC) a key corporate policy, recently expanded its financial toolkit with the introduction of a second Series A perpetual preferred stock, adding to its growing line of capital market instruments. The company is selling 8.5 million shares of the new offering, called Strife (STRF), at $85 each, giving it a net $711.2 million for bitcoin purchases. That's up from an initial target of $500 million. The sale ends later Tuesday. Strategy's earlier preferred issuance, Strike (STRK), initially raised $563 million. A perpetual preferred stock sits between debt and common equity in the capital structure, typically offering dividends and greater price stability. That makes it appealing to investors seeking lower volatility and more predictable returns. Unlike owners of common stock, holders do not get voting rights.  STRF pays a 10% annual dividend on a $100 stated amount, with payments made quarterly in cash. If Strategy misses a dividend, the amount compounds at an additional 1% a year each up to a maximum 18% dividend rate, creating an incentive for timely payments.  Strategy may redeem all STRF shares if fewer than 25% of the original issuance remains or under certain tax events, in which case shareholders would receive the liquidation preference plus any unpaid dividends. Additionally, in the event of a \u201cfundamental change,\u201d holders can force the company to repurchase their shares at the stated amount plus any accrued dividends. In contrast, STRK offers an 8% annual dividend based on its $100 liquidation preference, though the effective yield declines as STRK\u2019s price rises. Unlike STRF, STRK includes a conversion feature, allowing holders to swap their preferred shares into common stock at a 10:1 ratio if the common share price reaches $1,000, offering equity upside. That means the new issue functions even more as a fixed-income security, making it the less volatile of the two. While STRK may appeal to investors looking for a blend of yield and potential capital appreciation, STRF is clearly aimed at those prioritizing income and capital stability. To support these dividend payments, Strategy will rely on a combination of operational cash flow, proceeds from convertible debt offerings and at-the-market (ATM) share sales on the common stock.  Strategy also has an open ATM program in place for STRK, recently purchasing 130 BTC, and has about $3.57 billion remaining on its ATM capacity through the common stock, giving it significant flexibility to fund dividend commitments while continuing to pursue its bitcoin accumulation strategy. The company's shares rose more than 10% on Monday, by which point it held 506,137 BTC.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Britas and other popular water filtration systems are often made of plastic. For those who prefer metal, there are stainless steel offerings from Berkey and Boroux, shown below.     Well-considered industrial design is about the transitions. The equatorial seam on both the Berkey and Boroux units is probably cost-effective, but lends these units an institutional look. In contrast, a startup called Rorra produces a more designey stainless steel offering:       Rorra's more flowing form gives you the impression the designer(s) sweated the details. To me it's a lot easier on the eyes.    There are a couple of caveats with the Rorra. One is that it requires four AAA batteries. These do not power the filtration\u2014the unit is gravity-fed, as are the competitors'\u2014but provide the juice for the filter replacement notification light.   Which leads us to the second caveat. All water filtration systems require the user to periodically replace the filter. And the filters for these three manufacturers are proprietary, meaning if they go out of business, you've now got a worthless stainless steel artifact. Berkey has been around for over 30 years, providing some peace of mind as to their longevity. Boroux is a bit newer, having launched around 2016. Rorra, the newcomer, came on the market in 2020. With any luck their offering's better looks will lead to market longevity, but anytime you buy something from a new company that requires replacement parts, you are taking a gamble.   Sadly it doesn't seem to address the challenge of knowing the level of filtered water. \u00a0The gravity filters are slow (hours) and without a means to easily check you can either run dry or overflowing. \u00a0I resorted to installing an aftermarket level tube to my more pedestrian filter unit.\u00a0 Brita also make glass jugs, which I prefer over plastic or steel.It's only the wife that uses it though, there is nothing wrong with our tap water! The filters on the Berkey and Boroux will work in each others containers. We've had the Berkey since 2017, and its been great. The filters do also need to be periodically cleaned (usually about once a month). they are expensive, but the water is exceptionally clean. that is pretty nice looking!\u00a0 Test it out; it only takes a single click to unsubscribe With a stellar record of design and engineering successful products with World Class brands since 20...

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"ByRazzak Jallow  ByRazzak Jallow,  Forbes Councils Member.  Razzak Jallow is the CFO of pre-IPO fintech company FloQast.    The IPO market began to show signs of life last year, and that momentum is expected to carry over into 2025. According to Renaissance Capital, IPO proceeds surged over 50% last year, powered by high-profile debuts such as Reddit Inc. and Rubrik Inc. Looking ahead, Renaissance Capital anticipates a stellar year for IPOs in 2025, projecting 155 to 195 new listings as the market stabilizes and returns to more typical conditions. Among the standout companies expected to lead the IPO charge this year are fintech powerhouse Stripe, European payments leader Klarna and AI chipmaker Cerebras. As signs of an IPO recovery emerge in 2025, it\u2019s important to recognize the broader impact of a successful public debut. When a company makes a strong entry into the public market, it generates optimism and inspires other ambitious businesses to embark on their own IPO journeys. A well-executed IPO not only benefits the company but also contributes positively to the broader economy. As more companies gear up to enter the public market, here are four essential tips and best practices to help organizations strengthen their compliance processes, streamline IPO readiness and position themselves for a successful public debut. Before diving into the IPO process, assemble the right team to guide you through the experience. The reality is the IPO journey is a mix of exhilarating highs, unexpected twists and the occasional heart-pounding drop. So, surround yourself with seasoned consultants who have been around the block\u2014experts who can offer insights into what to expect during the IPO journey, the post-IPO landscape and, crucially, the regulatory environment. These advisors will help position your organization for success during your IPO and well beyond it. But it\u2019s not just about the IPO itself. Your team also needs to be ready for the workplace shifts that come after going public. New rules, controls and heightened scrutiny can be challenging to navigate. Public companies face far more attention than private ones, and public perception can directly impact stock value. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to prepare not just yourself but your entire team for the changes ahead. With the right people and mindset, you\u2019ll be better equipped to handle the transition and thrive in the public market. Before you embark on an IPO, you must roll up your sleeves and do your research. Start by pulling S-1 filings from other companies in your industry and studying them closely. Pay attention to the SEC\u2019s comments and questions on those filings\u2014they\u2019ll give you valuable insights into what regulators are looking for and help you avoid potential delays. But don\u2019t stop there. Look into regional and national associations for educational opportunities and networking events that can broaden your understanding of the IPO process. And don\u2019t underestimate the power of LinkedIn\u2014use it to connect with experienced financial professionals who\u2019ve been through the IPO journey. Their firsthand knowledge can be a gold mine of practical advice and lessons learned. If you\u2019re used to operating as a private company, the shift to being public will require adjustments. While you might be accustomed to monthly reporting for the CFO and board, as a public company, you\u2019ll need to prepare quarterly financial statements and disclosures. To make the transition smoother, start operating like a public company even before the IPO. That means tightening internal controls and documenting them thoroughly, establishing and enforcing approval hierarchies and getting comfortable with quarterly external reviews and annual audits. And don\u2019t forget, SOX compliance audits will become a regular part of your yearly routine. The good news is that technology can play a big role in getting you IPO-ready by supporting the ongoing reporting and compliance demands of being a public company. For instance, the right fintech software can help companies integrate compliance controls directly into their financial close and reconciliation workflows, ensuring that critical tasks are aligned with regulatory requirements. This kind of automation can reduce manual effort and minimizes errors, which is particularly valuable during an IPO when auditors demand precise and timely documentation. When you demonstrate a commitment to transparency and accountability, you show investors that the information you provide is accurate and reliable. That makes your organization more trustworthy and, thus, more attractive to potential shareholders. AI can be a game changer for accountants, especially during high-stakes processes like preparing for an IPO, where any mistake can be fatal. Automating routine tasks such as data entry, account reconciliations and financial statement preparation allows accountants to dedicate more time to strategic activities, like getting ready to go public. During the IPO process, teams are often understaffed, overworked and struggling against tight deadlines. And this is where AI shines. Generative AI can process vast amounts of data rapidly, delivering insights and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. For teams grappling with labor shortages, AI serves as a critical support system, handling repetitive tasks and freeing up resources for higher-level responsibilities, like IPO readiness and audit preparation. The IPO market is on the rebound, and for those who anticipate continued growth, it\u2019s time to buckle up. The ride could begin sooner than you think, so prepare to seize the moment. As you navigate this IPO process, remember not to get bogged down in the details. Approach it thoughtfully and methodically, yes, but make sure you maintain balance and focus on the big picture. After all, this is just the beginning of your company\u2019s public story. Forbes Finance Council is an invitation-only organization for executives in successful accounting, financial planning and wealth management firms. Do I qualify?","label":0}

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"        Pien Huang                        An assortment of aromas fill the air at the District Cannabis grow facility in Hagerstown, Md.                                                           Pien Huang\/NPR                                       hide caption  HAGERSTOWN, Md. \u2014 Just off the highway and down the road from the sheriff's office, there's a large warehouse and greenhouse compound locked behind barbed-wire gates. If you're driving by at certain times, you might catch a whiff of what's inside: Some call it skunky, some call it gassy. It's the unmistakable smell of weed. The complex is the grow facility for District Cannabis, which produces 15,000 pounds of cannabis flower each year. \"It's our weed factory \u2014 a dream come true,\" says Andras Kirschner, founder and head grower. Inside the factory, it's not all skunk. There's the earthy smell of plants growing and botanical notes of citrus and lavender. In recent years, that strong signature skunky funk of pot has given way to scent profiles of new cannabis strains that skew toward fruits, fresh herbs and candy. It's a trend that has blossomed with the increasing use of cannabis for recreational purposes, says Pamela Dalton, a smell scientist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center, a nonprofit research institute that focuses on smell and taste. \"People take all sorts of drugs that are unpleasant to taste or smell, but for recreation, you want something pleasurable in all facets,\" she says. \"That's driving some of the hybridization and evolution [of cannabis] \u2013 to make something you like smelling, that's pleasant and reinforces the ease of relaxation.\" At the District Cannabis grow facility, batches of young cannabis plants are grown to maturity, harvested and dried, then processed and packaged for retail sale. On a recent weekday morning, Kirschner gave NPR a tour of the operations. In a warm, humid room, 1,500 cannabis plants were in bloom, giving off a fruity, musky scent. Kirschner won the 2024 grand champion title in a competition with weed growers from Washington, D.C., Maryland and Virginia with a strain called Layer Cake. This one, perfuming the indoor grow room, is a cousin named Gelato Cake. Kirschner says, it's \"one of the more popular top-selling strains in the D.C. and Maryland markets for a number of years now.\" \"This is definitely one of our more complex profiles,\" says Kyle Perrell, the general manager of operations at the facility, describing the scent as sweetness and grapes with cognac and \"a fresh kerosene kind of smell on the back end.\"                  Each room at the District Cannabis grow facility smells like a different combination of musky, fruity gas. Terpenes, a class of chemical compounds found in many plants, contribute fresh aromatic notes.                                                           Pien Huang\/NPR                                       hide caption  Much of the scent and flavor variety among cannabis strains is attributed to terpenes, which are chemical compounds found in a lot of plants such as herbs, citrus and pine trees. For the Gelato Cake strain, Perrell says the dominant terpenes are caryophyllene, limonene and linalool, which give off floral, clove and citrus scents. And while the signature \"gas\" or \"skunk\" smell of cannabis used to be attributed to a \"skunky terpene,\" research over the past few years has pointed to a different culprit, says Monell's Dalton. \"They found out that it was actually a sulfur compound \u2013 which, to my thinking, would absolutely be responsible for a sulfur odor \u2013 the smell of skunk spray or anything like that,\" she says. It's the sulfur note, mixed with the fresher, more aromatic terpenes, that gives weed its signature smells. In some strains, though, that skunk note dominates. \"We are extremely sensitive to sulfur compounds,\" Dalton says, \"So if you have a range of compounds in your cannabis, it's likely that what you're going to smell first are the sulfur compounds.\" The classic weed smell was what cannabis breeders and growers in the past were going for, Kirschner says, \"and so a lot of the strains started to really exhibit that skunk smell.\" In more recent years, there's been a trend in cannabis cultivation toward new strains and hybrids that are more pleasant-smelling to more people. \"Now there's a wide diversity from berry to citrus, lemon lime, cherry. A lot of the popular strains are a combination between the gas and another flavor,\" says Kirschner. Dalton has observed this trend, too. \"I'm almost 70 years old, and the cannabis I smelled when I was 13, 14, 15 was way skunkier than anything I experience now,\" she says. The evolution of scents and flavors has converged on what Jamila Hogan, a longtime weed educator and head of the cannabis experience company Ebony Green, describes as \"Runtzacakelato.\"                   Stalks of Cherry Limeade Cake hang upside down to dry in the cure room. At the District Cannabis grow facility, cannabis plants are grown to maturity, harvested and dried, then processed and packaged for retail sale.                                                           Pien Huang\/NPR                                       hide caption  \"It's the Runts (like the candy), cake, gelato profile. You know it because the buds are often a little bit purple, super frosty,\" she says, referring to the abundance of resinous glands that coat the mature cannabis plants. Hogan says this scent and flavor profile \u2013 \"musky, gassy, sweet and skunk\" \u2013 has become dominant in the past five or so years. \"Before this profile, it was the gas,\" she says, \"Before the gas, it was fruity, and before the fruit was the kush.\" At the District Cannabis grow facility, every room smells like a different combination of musky, fruity gas. In the greenhouse, a strain called Pav\u00e9 gives off an \"overwhelmingly kushy, earthy, almost a little spearminty\" scent, according to Perrell, the general manager. In the cure room, stalks of Cherry Limeade Cake hang upside down to dry. In the trim room, workers prune the buds of a new strain called Berry Payton. Kirschner describes it as \"tropical Runts times Gary Payton [another strain],\" producing a fruity blueberry-scented hybrid. But nobody buys weed just to smell it. The cannabis grown here is destined for the local market. Some of it gets packaged and sold as flower, or extracted for edibles and vapes, or pre-rolled by an automated machine that can make 4 million joints a year, Kirschner says: \"We're currently not selling that much \u2014 but we can make them.\" In Maryland, where cannabis has been allowed for recreational use since 2023, consumers have spent more than $180 million on cannabis products in the first two months of the year.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"This weekly guide sorts the very best from the rest when it comes to the saturated world of sneaker releases, with information on prices and where to buy. Please note \u2014 some sneakers may sell out at speed. Raffles, friends and family, and player exclusives \u2014 all of that before a mere mention of the many fire general sneaker releases out there. The world of sneaker drops can be a tricky place to navigate, but we\u2019re here to help. Behold, the best of the best of what you can actually buy on the open market, right now. This week\u2019s selection is about as balanced as we\u2019ve seen so far, featuring collaborations, classic sportswear brands, and some Donkey Kong-themed Air Maxes. The cream of the sneaker crop awaits you. What are you waiting for? Release Date: March 27 Editor's Notes: Last year, A$AP Rocky released the first 3D-printed PUMA Mostro. Now, the musician is bringing another brand-new detail to the spiky-soled PUMA sneaker: This is the first PUMA Mostro to be adjustable with a disk system in place of regular laces.  The Mostro is Rocky's favorite archival sneaker from the early 2000s (according to PUMA), and he's continuing to find inventive ways to change its form.  Release Date: March 29 Editor's Notes: Bad Bunny and adidas' superflat \"Ballerina\" sneaker has arrived (almost a full year after it was first revealed, no less). Just when you thought flat sneakers had peaked, Bad Bunny takes the trend for barely-there soles to another extreme.  Release Date: March 26 Editor's Notes: Forget the official name for this sneaker, we're naming this the Donkey Kong Air Max 1. Nike's '90s gaming-inspired sneaker has a new hairy suede build reminiscent of Nintendo's famed gorilla character. Release Date: March 28 Editor's Notes: If there's one thing you can rely on from Jae Tips and Saucony, it's color (and lots of it). Their latest sneaker is another wild blend of fabrics, textures, and colors delivered by Jae Tips.  Release Date: March 29 Editor's Notes: If nothing else, Nike and A Ma Mani\u00e9re are consistent, the duo is regularly delivering luxuriously upgraded takes on Nike classics. This latest pair of spruced-up Air Maxs comes as part of a wider drop of elevated leather sneakers.  Release Date: March 26 Editor's Notes: This is a simple black pair of classic Stan Smith sneakers. That is, until you look closer and cracked leather detailing reveals itself.  Want to keep browsing?

From S&P S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index Records 4.1% Annual Gain in January 2025 The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price NSA Index, covering all nine U.S. census  divisions, reported a 4.1% annual return for January, up from a 4% annual gain in the previous month.  The 10-City Composite saw an annual increase of 5.3%, up from a 5.2% annual increase in the  previous month. The 20-City Composite posted a year-over-year increase of 4.7%, up from a 4.5%  increase in the previous month. New York again reported the highest annual gain among the 20 cities  with a 7.7% increase in January, followed by Chicago and Boston with annual increases of 7.5% and  6.6%, respectively. Tampa posted the lowest return, falling 1.5%. ... The pre-seasonally adjusted U.S. National and 20-City Composite Indices presented slight upward  trends in January, with both posting 0.1% increases. The 10-City Composite posted a monthly return of  0.2%.  After seasonal adjustment, the 20-City and 10-City Composite Indices posted month-over-month  increases of 0.5%. The U.S National posted a month-over-month increase of 0.6%.  \u201cHome price growth continued to moderate in January, reflecting a clear two-part story across the past  year,\u201d says Nicholas Godec, CFA, CAIA, CIPM, Head of Fixed Income Tradables & Commodities at  S&P Dow Jones Indices. \u201cThe National Composite Index posted a 4.1% annual gain, with the bulk of  appreciation\u20144.8%\u2014occurring in the first half of the year. Prices declined 0.7% in the second half, as  high mortgage rates and affordability constraints weighed on buyer demand and market activity.   \u201cAmong the 20 metro areas tracked by the Composite 20, New York City led annual gains with a 7.7%  rise, followed closely by Chicago (7.5%) and Boston (6.5%). Tampa was the only market to post a year over-year decline, falling 1.5%. However, the second half of the year told a different story: San  Francisco posted the largest six-month decline at 3.4%, followed by Tampa at 3.2%. Only four of the 20  cities managed to eke out price increases during this period\u2014New York, Chicago, Phoenix, and  Boston\u2014highlighting broad-based cooling.  \u201cRising mortgage rates throughout the year elevated monthly payment burdens, which, combined with  already high home prices, pushed affordability to multi-decade lows in many regions. This likely  contributed to subdued activity in the back half of the year, with both buyers and sellers exercising  caution. Inventory constraints also remain a challenge, particularly in legacy metro areas, where limited  new construction continues to restrict supply.   \u201cThe strength in markets like New York and Chicago may reflect more normalized valuations relative to  frothier regions, along with continued urban recovery trends post-pandemic. On the other hand, Sunbelt  markets that experienced sharp run-ups earlier in the cycle\u2014like Tampa and Phoenix\u2014have seen the  most pronounced slowdowns. emphasis added Click on graph for larger image.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"A few months ago, Casey Newton of Platformer ran a piece called \"The phony comforts of AI skepticism,\" framing those who would criticize generative AI as \"having fun,\" damning them as \"hyper-fixated on the things [AI] can't do.\" I am not going to focus too hard on this blog, in part because because Edward Ongweso Jr. already did so, and in part because I believe that there are much larger problems at work here. Newton is, along with his Hard Fork co-host Kevin Roose, actively engaged in a cynical marketing campaign, a repetition of the last two hype cycles where Casey Newton blindly hyped the metaverse and Roose pumped the bags of a penguin-themed NFT project. The cycle continues with Roose running an empty-headed screed about what he \"believes\" about the near-term trajectory of artificial intelligence \u2014 that AGI will be here in the next two years, that we are not ready, but also that he cannot define it or say what it does \u2014 to Newton claiming that OpenAI\u2019s Deep Research is \"the first good agent\" despite the fact his own examples show exactly how mediocre it is. You see, optimism is easy. All you have to do is say \"I trust these people to do the thing they'll do\" and choose to take a \"cautiously optimistic\" (to use Roose's terminology) view on whatever it is that's put in front of you. Optimism allows you to think exactly as hard as you'd like to, using that big, fancy brain of yours to make up superficially intellectually-backed rationalizations about why something is the future, and because you're writing at a big media outlet, you can just say whatever and people will believe you because you're ostensibly someone who knows what they're talking about. As a result, Roose, in a piece in the New York Times seven months before the collapse of FTX, was able to print that he'd \"...come to accept that [crypto] isn't all a cynical money-grab, and that there are things of actual substance being built,\" all without ever really proving anything. Roose's \"Latecomer's Guide To Cryptocurrency\" never really makes any argument about anything, other than explaining, in a \"cautiously optimistic\" way, the \"features\" of blockchain technology, all without really having to make any judgment but \"guess we'll wait and see!\"\u00a0 While it might seem difficult to write 14,000 words about anything \u2014 skill issue, by the way \u2014 Roose's work is a paper thin, stapled-together FAQs about a technology that still, to this day, lacks any real use cases. Three years later, we\u2019re still waiting for those \u201cthings of actual substance,\u201d or, for that matter, any demonstration that it isn\u2019t a \u201ccynical money-grab.\u201d\u00a0 Roose's AGI piece is somehow worse. Roose spends thousands of words creating flimsy intellectual rationalizations, writing that \"the people closest to the technology \u2014 the employees and executives of the leading A.I. labs \u2014 tend to be the most worried about how fast it\u2019s improving,\" and that \"the people with the best information about A.I. progress \u2014 the people building powerful A.I., who have access to more-advanced systems than the general public sees \u2014 are telling us that big change is near.\" In other words, the people most likely to benefit from the idea (and not necessarily the reality) that AI is continually improving and becoming more powerful are those who insist that AGI \u2014 an AI that surpasses human ability, and can tackle pretty much any task presented to it \u2014 is looming on the horizon.\u00a0\u00a0 The following quote is most illuminating: Roose's argument, and I am being completely serious, is that he has talked to some people \u2014 some of them actively investing in the thing he's talking about who are incentivized to promote an agenda where he tells everybody they're building AGI \u2014 and these people have told him that a non-specific thing is happening at some point, and that it will be bigger than people understand. Insiders are \"alarmed.\" Companies are \"preparing\" (writing blogs) for AGI. It's all very scary. But, to quote Roose, \"...even if you ignore everyone who works at A.I. companies, or has a vested stake in the outcome, there are still enough credible independent voices with short A.G.I. timelines that we should take them seriously.\" Roose's entire argument can be boiled down to \"AI models are much better,\" and when he says \"much better\" he means \"they are able to get high scores on benchmarks,\" at which point he does not mention which ones, or question the fact that they (despite him saying these exact words) have had to \"create new, harder tests to measure their capabilities,\" which can be read as \"make up new tests to say why these models are good.\" He mentions, in passing, that hallucinations still happen, but \"they're rarer on newer models,\" a statement he does not back up with evidence. He mentions that \"...in A.I., bigger models, trained using more data and processing power, tend to produce better results, and today\u2019s leading models are significantly bigger than their predecessors.\" He does not explain what those results are, what results they produce, and what said results lead to as products, largely because they haven't. He talks about \"...if you really want to grasp how much better A.I. has gotten recently, talk to a programmer,\" then fails to quote a single programmer. I won't go on, because the article is boring, thinly-sourced and speciously-founded. But it's also an example of how comfortable optimism is. Roose doesn't have to make actual arguments \u2013 he makes statements, finds one example of something that confirms his biases, and then moves on. By choosing the cautiously-optimistic template, Roose can present \"intelligent people that are telling him things\" as proof that confirms what he wants to believe, which is that Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, who he just interviewed on Hard Fork, is correct when he says that AGI is mere years away. Roose is framing his optimism as a warning \u2013 all without ever having to engage with what AGI is and the actual ramifications of its imminence. If he did, he would have to discuss concepts like personage. Is a conscious AI system alive? Does it have rights? And, for that matter, what even is consciousness? That\u2019s no discussion of the massive, world-changing consequences of a (again, totally theoretical, no proof this exists) artificial intelligence that's as smart and capable (again, how is it capable?) as a human being. Being an AI optimist is extremely comfortable, because Roose doesn't even have to do any real analysis \u2014 he has other people to do it for him, such as the people that stand to profit from generative AI's proliferation. Roose doesn't have to engage with the economics, or the actual capabilities of these models, or even really understand how they work. He just needs enough to be able to say \"wow, that's so powerful!\" Cautious optimism allows Roose to learn as little as necessary to write his column, knowing that the market wants AI to work, even as facts scream that it doesn't. Cautious optimism is extremely comfortable, because \u2014 as Roose knows from boosting cryptocurrency \u2014 that there are few repercussions for being too optimistic. I, personally, believe that there should be.Here's a thing I wrote three years ago \u2014 the last time Roose decided to boost an entire movement based on vibes and his own personal biases. I hate that I've spent nearly two thousand words kvetching over Roose's work, but it's necessary, because I want to be abundantly clear: cautious optimism is cowardice. Criticism \u2014 skepticism \u2014 takes a certain degree of bravery, or at least it does so when you make fully-formed arguments. Both Roose and Newton, participating in their third straight hype-cycle boost, frame skepticism as lazy, ignorant and childish. To quote Casey: Newton doesn't actually prove that anyone has raised a ceiling, and in fact said: This is not meaningful analysis, and it's deeply cowardly on a number of levels. Newton does not prove his point in any way \u2014 he makes up a person that combines several ideas about generative AI, says that open source will \u201ccatch up,\u201d and that also there will be some sort of indeterminate harm. It doesn't engage with a single critic\u2019s argument. It is, much like a lot of Newton\u2019s work, the intellectual equivalent of saying \u201cnuh uh!\u201d Newton delights in his phony comforts. He proves his points in the flimsiest ways, knowing that the only criticisms he'll get are from the people he's steadfastly othered, people that he will never actually meaningfully engage with. He knows that his audience trusts him, and thus he will never have to meaningfully engage with the material. In fact, Newton isn't really proving anything \u2014 he is stating his own assumptions, giving the thinnest possible rationale, and then singling out Gary Marcus because he perceives him as an easy target. This is, to repeat myself, extremely comfortable. Newton, like Roose, simply has to follow whatever the money is doing at any given time, learn enough about it to ask some questions in a podcast, and then get on with his day. There is nothing more comfortable than sitting on the podcast of a broadsheet newspaper and writing a newsletter for 150,000 people with no expectation that you'd ever have to push back on anything. And I cannot be clear enough how uncomfortable it is being a skeptic or a cynic during these cycles, even before people like Casey Newton started trying to publicly humiliate critics like Gary Marcus.  My core theses \u2014 The Rot Economy (that the tech industry has become dominated by growth), The Rot-Com Bubble (that the tech industry has run out of hyper-growth ideas), and that generative AI has created a kind of capitalist death cult where nobody wants to admit that they're not making any money \u2014 are far from comfortable. The ramifications of a tech industry that has become captured by growth are that true innovation is being smothered by people that neither experience nor know how (or want) to fix real problems, and that the products we use every day are being made worse for a profit. These incentives have destroyed value-creation in venture capital and Silicon Valley at large, lionizing those who are able to show great growth metrics rather than creating meaningful products that help human beings. The ramifications of the end of hyper-growth mean a massive reckoning for the valuations of tech companies, which will lead to tens of thousands of layoffs and a prolonged depression in Silicon Valley, the likes of which we've never seen. The ramifications of the collapse of generative AI are much, much worse. On top of the fact that the largest tech companies have burned hundreds of billions of dollars to propagate software that doesn't really do anything that resembles what we think artificial intelligence looks like, we're now seeing that every major tech company (and an alarming amount of non-tech companies!) is willing to follow whatever it is that the market agrees is popular, even if the idea itself is flawed. Generative AI has laid bare exactly how little the markets think about ideas, and how willing the powerful are to try and shove something unprofitable, unsustainable and questionably-useful down people's throats as a means of promoting growth. It's also been an alarming demonstration of how captured some members of the media have become, and how willing people like Roose and Newton are to defend other people's ideas rather than coming up with their own. In short, reality can fucking suck, but a true skeptic learns to live in it. It's also hard work. Proving that something is wrong \u2014 really proving it \u2014 requires you to push against the grain, and battering your own arguments repeatedly. Case in point: my last article about CoreWeave was the product of nearly two weeks of work, where, alongside my editor, we poured over the company\u2019s financial statements trying to separate reality from hype. Whenever we found something damning, we didn\u2019t immediately conclude it validated our original thesis \u2014 that the company is utterly rotten. We tried to find other explanations that were equally or more plausible to our own hypothesis \u2014 \u201csteelmanning\u201d our opponent because being skeptical demands a level of discomfort.\u00a0 Hard work, sure, but when your hypotheses are vindicated by later reporting by the likes of Semafor and the Financial Times, it all becomes worthwhile. I\u2019ll talk about CoreWeave in greater depth later in this post, because it\u2019s illustrative of the reality-distorting effects of AI optimism, and how optimism can make people ignore truths that are, quite literally, written in black ink and published for all the world to see.\u00a0 An optimist doesn't have to prove that things will go well \u2014 a skeptic must, in knowing that they are in the minority, be willing to do the hard work of pulling together distinct pieces of information in something called an \"analysis.\" A skeptic cannot simply say \"I talked to some people,\" because skeptics are \"haters,\" and thus must be held to some higher standard for whatever reason. The result of a lack of true skepticism and criticism is that the tech industry has become captured by people that are able to create their own phony and comfortable realities, such as OpenAI, a company that burned $5 billion in 2024 and is currently raising $40 billion, the majority of it from SoftBank, which will have to raise $16 billion or more to fund it. Engaging with this kind of thinking is far from comfortable, because what I am describing is one of the largest abdications of responsibility by financial institutions and members of the media in history. OpenAI and Anthropic are abominations of capitalism, bleeding wounds that burn billions of dollars with no end in sight for measly returns on selling software that lacks any real mass market use case. Their existence is proof that Silicon Valley is capable of creating its own illogical realities and selling them to corporate investors that have lost any meaningful way to evaluate businesses, drunk off of vibes and success stories from 15 or more years ago. What we are witnessing is a systemic failure, not the beginnings of a revolution. Large Language Models have never been a mass market product \u2014 other than ChatGPT, generative AI products are barely a blip on the radar \u2014 and outside of NVIDIA (and consultancy Turing), there doesn't appear to be one profitable enterprise in the industry, nor is there any sign any of these companies will ever stop burning money. The leaders behind the funding, functionality, and media coverage of the tech industry have abdicated their authority so severely that the consensus is that it's fine that OpenAI burns $5 billion a year, and it's also fine that OpenAI, or Anthropic, or really any other generative AI company has no path to profitability. Furthermore, it's fine that these companies are destroying our power grid and our planet, and it's also fine that they stole from millions of creatives while simultaneously undercutting those creatives in an already-precarious job market. The moment it came out that OpenAI was burning so much money should've begun an era of renewed criticism and cynicism about these companies. Instead, I received private messages that I was \"making too big a deal\" out of it. These are objectively horrifying things \u2014 blinking red warning signs that our markets and our media have reached an illogical point where they believe that destruction isn't just acceptable, but necessary to make sure that \"smart tech people\" are able to build the future, even if they haven't built anything truly important in quite some time, or even if there\u2019s no evidence they can build their proposed future. I am not writing this with any comfort or satisfaction. I am fucking horrified. Our core products \u2014 Facebook, Google Search, Microsoft Office, Google Docs, and even basic laptops \u2014 are so much worse than they've ever been, and explaining these things unsettles and upsets me. Digging into the fabric of why these companies act in this way, seeing how brazen and even proud they are of their pursuit of growth, it fills me full of disgust, and I'm not sure how people like Roose and Newton don't feel the same way. And now I want to show you how distinctly uncomfortable all of this is.   Last week, I covered the shaky state of AI data center provider CoreWeave \u2014 an unprofitable company riddled by onerous debt, with 77% of its $1.9 billion of 2024 revenue coming from Microsoft and NVIDIA. CoreWeave lost $863 million in revenue in 2024, and when I published this analysis, some people suggested that its \"growth would fix things,\" and that OpenAI's deal to buy $11.9 billion of compute over five years was a sign that everything would be okay. Since then, some things have come out: To summarize (and repeat one part from my previous article): I'm afraid I'm not done explaining why I'm uncomfortable. Let me make this much simpler. Okay, simpler. CoreWeave's continued existence is contingent on its ability to borrow money, pay its debts, and expand its business, which is contingent on OpenAI's ability to raise money and expand its business, which is contingent on SoftBank's ability to give it money, which is contingent on SoftBank's ability to borrow money. OpenAI is CoreWeave. CoreWeave is OpenAI. SoftBank is now both CoreWeave and OpenAI, and if SoftBank buckles, both CoreWeave and OpenAI are dead. For this situation to work even for the next year, these companies will have to raise tens of billions of dollars just to maintain the status quo. There is nothing comfortable about my skepticism, and in fact I'd argue it's a huge pain in the ass. Being one of the few people that is willing to write down the numbers in stark, objective detail is a frustrating exercise \u2014 and it's isolating too, especially when I catch strays from Casey Newton claiming he's taking \"detailed notes\" about my work as a punishment for the sin of \"doing basic mathematics and asking why nobody else seems to want to.\" It isn't comfortable to continually have to explain to people who are all saying \"AI is the future\" that the majority of what they are discussing is fictional, because it reveals how many people believe things based entirely on someone they trust saying it's real, or being presented a flimsy argument that confirms their biases or affirms their own status quo. In Newton and Roose's case, this means that they continue being the guys that people trust will bring them the truth about the future. This position is extremely comfortable, as it doesn't require them to be correct, only convincing and earnest.   I don't fear that we're \"not taking AGI seriously.\" I fear that we've built our economy on top of NVIDIA, which is dependent on the continued investment in GPUs from companies like Microsoft, Amazon and Google, one of which has materially pulled back from data center expansion. Outside of NVIDIA, nobody is making any profit off of generative AI, and once that narrative fully takes hold, I fear a cascade of events that gores a hole in the side of the stock market and leads to tens of thousands of people losing their jobs. Framing skepticism as comfortable is morally bankrupt, nakedly irresponsible, and calls into question the ability of those saying it to comprehend reality, as well as their allegiances. It's far more comfortable to align with the consensus, to boost the powerful in the hopes that they will win and that their victories will elevate you even further, even if your position is currently at the very top of your industry. While it's possible to take a kinder view of those who peddle this kind of optimism \u2014 that they may truly believe these things and can dismiss the problems as surmountable \u2014 I do not see at this time in history how one can logically or rationally choose to do so. To choose to believe that this will \"all just work out\" at this point is willful ignorance and actively refusing to engage with reality. I cannot speak to the rationale or incentives behind the decision to do so, but to do so with a huge platform, to me, is morally reprehensible. Be optimistic if you'd like, but engage with the truth when you do so.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"BySpencer Elliott  BySpencer Elliott,  Contributor.  A steady pulse of new construction underscores the enduring faith in Austin\u2019s real estate market, ... More from builders and buyers alike. Austin\u2019s new-construction landscape in 2025 is experiencing something remarkable: a controlled cooling that feels less like a letdown and more like a long-awaited exhale. After the frenzied bidding wars and razor-thin inventory of 2021\u2014when Austin emerged as \u201cthe hottest market in the U.S.\u201d amid surging commercial real estate investment and out-of-state corporate relocations\u2014both builders and buyers have settled into a more measured rhythm. Rather than halting projects, developers have embraced a moderate pace, a nod to the city\u2019s persistent population growth and robust economy. Over the past year, new-home inventory has hovered around five months\u2019 supply (about 1,400 listings per month at the current sales rate), inching close to the balanced market threshold that gives buyers and sellers near-equal negotiating power. Newly built home prices have softened, offering modest relief to prospective buyers and coaxing them ... More back into the market. Is this shift permanent? Maybe not. But it is recalibrating expectations. At the heart of this fresh equilibrium lies a simple, vital truth: Austin is still growing. Tech firms expand or relocate, new residents arrive in search of cultural vibrancy, and the city\u2019s enduring draws\u2014lakeside recreation, live music and an entrepreneurial buzz\u2014remain irresistible. Many homeowners cling to the historically low interest rates they secured over the past few years, making them reluctant to sell. As a result, the new-home sector has emerged as a fitting hero, filling gaps in a market once defined by scarcity. Today, the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan area ranks among the country\u2019s fastest-growing hotbeds of development: third in multifamily construction and first in single-family builds. New construction now accounts for nearly one-third of all homes on the market\u2014a historically high share propelled by the dearth of existing stock and builders\u2019 commitment to putting new product on shelves. The region\u2019s supply of new homes has reached what many experts consider a textbook definition of balance. Nearly one-third of Austin\u2019s available homes are new construction, a segment that also leads the ... More pack when it comes to bold contemporary design. Practically speaking, that balance gives everyone room to breathe. Buyers can finally exhale; sellers must remain realistic. Some builders have offered price reductions while others sweeten the deal by covering portions of closing costs or by featuring cutting-edge design details. These tactics bore fruit with a surge in closings at the end of 2024. Indeed, by March 2024, Austin ranked seventh nationwide for new-construction home sales. Housing starts for single-family homes ticked up around 8% year-on-year in late 2024 and local construction employment stayed positive\u2014each reflecting confidence in Austin\u2019s ongoing draw. This renewed faith in new construction extends to the ultra-luxury bracket, where buyers swoop in for premium views and lakeside locales without the delay of custom builds. \u201cUp in the hills or near the lake, you\u2019re looking at a very limited geographic area where supply is always constrained,\u201d explains Sean Kubicek of Moreland Properties. \u201cYou have expensive land costs, you face jurisdictional obstacles and sometimes there are site limitations. So, if you want something new in a prime spot, you\u2019ll either wait years for approvals and construction or find an existing high-quality, finished project.\u201d For the privilege, expect prices that regularly eclipse $5 million. Marrying contemporary convenience with on-trend aesthetics, newly built homes often command premium ... More prices in Austin\u2014particularly along the city\u2019s scenic waterfronts. In addition to immediate availability, new luxury homes often house amenities unmatched by older, established properties. Eric Moreland of Moreland Properties points out that builders \u201caim to include amenities that stand apart from any resale property\u2014things like a separate catering kitchen, extra garage bays or an oversized primary closet.\u201d One of Moreland\u2019s new hillside waterfront listings, priced at $8.9 million, showcases a sprawling suite of perks: a dedicated games room, media room, wet bar, sauna-equipped fitness studio, poolside cabana, guest casita and multiple garages. Designs themselves are also moving in flashier directions to meet buyers\u2019 expectations. According to Kubicek, the well-loved \u201cwarm, organic modern\u201d style is merging with something bolder. \u201cThere\u2019s been a bigger trend toward what I call the Roaring 20s aesthetic\u2014more ostentation, more statement,\u201d he says. Kubicek currently represents a stylish Westlake home that demonstrates this shift with grand gabled volumes connected by a glass bridge, set off by striking stone features. Oversized windows dominate Austin\u2019s hillside neighborhoods, capitalizing on the dramatic panoramas ... More that stretch across the horizon. With new luxury builds striking all the right chords with buyers, and builders maintaining unshakable faith in Austin\u2019s market, the city\u2019s high-end development future might seem limitless\u2014except for one pressing obstacle: space, especially in the coveted hillside and lakeside neighborhoods of western Austin. That limitation makes local zoning debates crucial in deciding how and where these projects find room to grow. Opinions, however, are split. Some residents champion denser development\u2014particularly multifamily or townhome structures\u2014to relieve Austin\u2019s ongoing housing crunch. Others worry that escalating growth will undermine the area\u2019s established charm. Builders find themselves at the crossroads, striving to meet City Hall\u2019s call for sustainable expansion while navigating homeowners\u2019 concerns about congestion and aesthetics. In practice, many new-build projects are, in fact, teardowns. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have a lot of empty parcels for sale on the west side,\u201d says fellow Moreland Properties agent Greg Walling. \u201cSo it\u2019s often a matter of demolishing older homes to make room for the new.\u201d Demolition can mean sacrificing some local heritage, but it also clears the way for fresh design and modern functionality\u2014amenities that increasingly appeal to the city\u2019s younger, forward-thinking buyers. Where modern farmhouse once ruled, a refined \u201cmodern minimalist\u201d style\u2014elevated by warm, luxurious ... More finishes\u2014now takes center stage. Some designers have dubbed this shift \u201cminimaluxe.\u201d So where does that leave the prospective buyer looking for new construction? With options. True, the pace of construction and the city\u2019s nuanced regulations can limit the selection. Yet the combination of more balanced inventory and softened price points has revived opportunities that were unthinkable at the height of 2021 mania. Those with precise demands\u2014proximity to downtown, access to green space or a one-of-a-kind architectural flourish\u2014may still face stiff competition. But the days of making an offer without an inspection or pleading with sellers to simply look one\u2019s way have largely receded. It may not sound thrilling\u2014normalcy rarely does\u2014but for Austin, normal is exactly what the market needed.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Games run great on it, but the $2,000 price hurts by  Tyler Colp The most powerful graphics card you can buy right now is actually pretty worthless if you don\u2019t have the right PC gaming setup. Nvidia\u2019s GeForce RTX 5090 is at its best when paired with a 4K monitor that can reach high refresh rates, like 144 Hz or 240 Hz. Anything less than that diminishes the value of an already ridiculously expensive card. A graphics card as beefy as the RTX 5090 needs to chew on the toughest games to justify its $1,999 price tag. I\u2019m talking about Alan Wake 2 with everything set to max, or Cyberpunk 2077 with all the ray tracing on. It\u2019s a card for people who don\u2019t mind paying to not have to fiddle with graphics settings. Chances are, you already know if that\u2019s you or not. The RTX 5090 didn\u2019t transform my experience with games \u2014 it mostly saved me time. I\u2019ve been using a card sent to me for review by Nvidia, and over the last month I haven\u2019t had to think about frame rate. Even a game as unstable as Monster Hunter Wilds ran almost flawlessly on my PC \u2014 which is equipped with an Intel Core i9-12900K 5.2 GHz 16-core processor, 32 GB of RAM, and a 1000 W power supply. I\u2019m also running everything on an 4K 32-inch MSI OLED monitor. All the reports of stuttering and abysmal frame rates didn\u2019t affect me. And that\u2019s really the whole reason you\u2019d buy the most expensive graphics card in the world right now: to boot up any game and know it\u2019ll have enough overhead to run just fine. That doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019d recommend it, though. Even if it were possible to find one in stock, the RTX 5090 isn\u2019t worth it for almost anyone in need of an upgrade or looking to build a gaming PC. There are far more reasonable options out there, particularly in Nvidia\u2019s previous generations of cards. That\u2019s largely because you don\u2019t actually need an RTX 5090 to benefit from several of its best features. The 40-series cards can use both DLSS 4 and Frame Generation, which leaves the RTX 5090\u2019s primary advantages in Multi Frame Generation and raw horsepower. In other words: The RTX 5090 is mostly a peek at what future hardware iterations could be capable of at more reasonable prices. It\u2019s proof that Nvidia\u2019s AI-powered upscaling technologies, DLSS and Frame Generation, can get even better than they already were. Both of them really do feel like magic when they work, and they\u2019re only becoming more important as it gets harder and harder to afford the latest hardware. For example: I cranked up every single setting in Cyberpunk 2077 as high as it would go. My frame rate chugged as the RTX 5090 churned out scenes with real-time reflections in the puddles and cars whizzing by. But unless I wanted to spend hours people-watching in Night City, the game was unplayably slow. With DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation on, however, it went from a choppy mess in motion to a slightly sluggish but playable game that was hitting upward of 120 frames per second. I could run through the busy market full of NPCs and neon signage without a hitch. If I was willing to put up with a slight delay between my button presses and the actions on screen \u2014 similar to how it feels to stream a game over the cloud \u2014 Cyberpunk 2077 was playable at a high frame rate on settings that were mostly a novelty in the past. It still wasn\u2019t smooth enough to justify relatively minor improvements in the lighting over less absurd graphics settings. The more you rely on Multi Frame Generation to insert AI-created frames, the more input lag is introduced, meaning your button presses will have a noticeable delay. In situations where you need to drastically increase the frame rate to make the game visually playable, you\u2019ll have to sacrifice responsiveness. And it hurts a fast-paced first-person shooter like Cyberpunk 2077 the most. It was certainly impressive seeing the game run well above 60 frames per second on a high-refresh-rate monitor. Normally, that would require a lot of graphical sacrifices to pull off. But just because it was playable doesn\u2019t mean it was tolerable. It\u2019s a feature much better suited for when you\u2019re not aiming for super-high frame rates, which is why I see no reason to invest in an RTX 5090 and an expensive monitor for it. And remember: Nvidia\u2019s other 50-series cards can use Multi Frame Generation too, so the high frame rate life doesn\u2019t require the top-of-the-line GPU. DLSS 4 is a similar story. This version of the upscaling tech uses a new AI model that basically makes details on objects look a little less blurry, especially in motion. On my 4K monitor, I had to stop and squint in Alan Wake 2 and Marvel Rivals to really notice a difference. Things like raindrops sliding down a window or blades of grass had slightly sharper details in DLSS 4 over DLSS 3, but my frame rates were about the same. These are the kinds of improvements worth waiting 10 minutes to download new drivers that enable it on your 40-series card, rather than spending thousands of dollars on an RTX 5090. The only tiny caveat to that is Ray Reconstruction, a high-end feature for games with the fanciest ray tracing, which is also known as path tracing. Path tracing makes even the RTX 5090 sweat from all the calculations it has to do to accurately track how light bounces around a scene. Lesser cards can barely handle it. It\u2019s the kind of thing you turn on, admire for 30 seconds, and turn off again to reclaim the chunk of frames it eats up. Ray Reconstruction uses AI-powered denoisers to make the job significantly easier, which causes it to take a much smaller bite out of your frame rate. While you can definitely see and feel the difference in games like Cyberpunk 2077 \u2014 headlights cast sharper cones of light on the road as you drive \u2014 it feels like the first step in making path tracing less of a luxury feature. DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation overshadow a lot of the raw power of the RTX 5090. Everything from Diablo 4 to Assassin\u2019s Creed Shadows ran exceptionally well on it, easily hitting over 60 fps. That was the same case in Alan Wake 2 and Marvel Rivals. Both games gained about 20 to 30 fps over my RTX 4090, and were able to sit comfortably at 60 fps even during intense action. The slight increases weren\u2019t particularly noticeable without staring at the fps counter, though. In practice, all it really meant was that there were fewer times where the frame rate would dip low enough for me to notice it. That kind of overhead is nice to have, especially when you\u2019re trying to hit solid fps at 4K, but it\u2019s not enough to justify hunting an RTX 5090 down and shelling out the money for it, especially when anyone with an RTX 4090 or an RTX 5080 will be able to take advantage of DLSS and regular Frame Generation already. The RTX 5090 is the most powerful GPU right now, but it\u2019s also the most niche GPU right now. It\u2019s not a substantial upgrade from the RTX 4090, nor is it the most cost-effective upgrade for those who have an RTX 30-series or older card. It\u2019s a high-end GPU for people who don\u2019t need a review to tell them whether it\u2019s worth it or not. For everyone else, it\u2019s really just a concept for where graphics tech is headed. Eventually, a much cheaper card with these features will come around. You\u2019re better off acting like it doesn\u2019t exist while you take advantage of all the software improvements Nvidia made along with it.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Business Insider Edition  The elaborate morning routine of fitness influencer Ashton Hall has gone viral, particularly over his affinity for Saratoga spring water. He swigs it from its signature blue glass bottle, brings it to the gym and pool, and, most crucially, uses it to fill a bowl of ice water to repeatedly dunk his face into.          The video first went viral on X, when it was posted by an account that features men's fashion content. It's since been reposted over 77,000 times, and Saratoga bottles as a meme have spread to other platforms.        View this post on Instagram               A post shared by Ashton Hall (@ashtonhallofficial)           I suppose there are people in the world who demand cinma vrit from the \"get ready with me\" routines of a fitness influencer. I am not one of those people. I don't care if this is slightly faked and Hall doesn't actually do all this every morning. Frankly, it rules.               Sure, Hall's routine is extravagant and unrealistic for most people (especially the type of slobs who hang out on X all day, myself included).               But in the world of fitness or wellness influencers, it doesn't seem that notable to me. Waking up absurdly early, morning prayer and journaling, pre-dawn workouts, and mouth taping are all incredibly common among the male fitness influencers I see on Instagram.               And while facial ice baths and wiping banana peels on your skin are less common, you can find plenty of articles in women's media about the benefits of both. (Cosmopolitan says that rubbing banana peels on your face \"makes an excellent face mask\" and that \"the vitamins nourish and hydrate the skin, leaving you with fresher looking skin.\")               And frankly, I see far more Byzantine morning routines from female wellness creators, who wake up just as early and will use thousands of dollars of skincare creams, supplements, and makeup each morning.

Apparently, he was a college athlete (once his video went viral over the weekend, people dug up his old football stats). He runs a coaching business where he teaches other aspiring personal trainers\/fitness content creators how to build their own brand and business. The daily routine videos are quick edits, with almost no dialogue or voiceover.               People really latched onto the aspect that was either purely theatrical or the work of a madman: the consumption of Saratoga brand water.               It's not just this video, either.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"  Home > Lawsuits > IPTV and Streaming >                          Premier League, Sky & ACE are celebrating the sentencing of one of the most elusive targets ever pursued in the pirate IPTV market. The man operated an IPTV empire out of Lebanon, supplying pirated content 'wholesale' all around world. Yet, despite an investigation that may already be close to a decade old, the man still isn't being named, and his platform isn't being named either. At least not officially.              The Premier League, UK broadcaster Sky, plus global anti-piracy coalition Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment, are reporting the conclusion of a \u2018landmark\u2019 pirate IPTV case in the Middle East.  According to their statement, a joint criminal complaint in Lebanon led to an unnamed defendant being found guilty of five criminal charges, including unspecified intellectual property and cybercrime-related offenses.  The precise origin, nature, and date of a ruling cited in the announcement are not made clear although, at least to some extent, the ruling\u2019s requirements are more detailed. The rightsholders state that the ruling orders the shutdown of the defendant\u2019s \u2018seized websites\u2019 and the deletion of all data from his \u2018devices\u2019. The identities and functions of those websites, including when and how they were seized, and the nature of the devices, including their function and what they contained, also go unexplained.  A requirement that all accounts used for client and customer communication must be deleted, seems fairly straightforward, yet still lacks details usually associated with cases of such importance. Hoping to fill in the gaps, TorrentFreak requested a copy of the court order. \u201cThe court order is not public as it is classified as a non-public judicial decision and is subject to confidentiality under local legal procedures,\u201d we were informed. The person convicted and subsequently sentenced to serve 11 months in prison and pay more than US$90,000 in penalties and damages, \u201cwas the operator of a platform responsible for supplying illegal streams to pirate services around the world,\u201d the rightsholders confirm. In common with its alleged operator, the service isn\u2019t named. While that\u2019s unfortunate from a reporting perspective, any frustration pales into insignificance when compared to the time, effort, and resources expended by the Premier League, Sky, and ACE on this case. Even from our very limited knowledge of the investigation, it seems likely to have been one of the longest of its type ever undertaken. Obtaining any type of conviction that is directly linked to the infamous Globe IPTV, as information shows, was never going to be easy. Use of the Globe brand in connection with TV piracy dates back over a decade. The supply of CCCAM servers focused on Sky broadcasts may have laid the groundwork for its entry into the IPTV market towards 2014\/2015.  Globe\u2019s focus was on the supply of broadcasters\u2019 streams on a wholesale basis, as the Premier League\u2019s 2022 submission to the European Commission\u2019s Counterfeit and Piracy Watch List explains.      Similar claims featured in subsequent submissions to the EC and the USTR\u2019s Notorious Markets Report. Globe\u2019s \u2018wholesale\u2019 strategy meant that it \u201coperates higher up the IPTV ecosystem, selling content and services to resellers who then ultimately make the content available to the public,\u201d the Premier League explained. The claim that Globe was known to have supplied multiple pirate services already sued by the Premier League is supported by the prosecution of Flawless TV, the largest case of its kind ever to conclude in the UK. When Flawless launched in August 2016, Globe was a major supplier to the operation. Among other content, Globe supplied Flawless with premium content belonging to Sky and BT Sport, at rates fairly easily deduced from one of our earlier reports. The source of that content was cable operator Virgin Media, which for some time had faced consumer-end piracy on a massive scale.  Virgin started to regain control in 2017 and with the introduction of new encryption around a year later, Globe\u2019s cable source in the UK was on life support. Satellite feeds remained viable, however, albeit at significant additional cost to Globe. Virgin Media\u2019s bill was significantly bigger; closing the loophole meant replacing millions of set-top boxes in homes across the UK. Over the past couple of years, various industry reports have mentioned Globe quite openly but on occasion, descriptions of events or scenarios that closely match existing knowledge about Globe have also made an appearance. Unaccompanied by the kind of detail required to remove all doubt, these seemingly random snapshots variously seemed to suggest that enforcement wasn\u2019t far away, or might even be imminent. Following a relatively recent event, also lacking information sufficient to make a provable connection, the signs suggested a potentially terminal blow from which Globe might never recover; albeit from one which it seemingly did.  At least for a while and in theory, potentially far longer than that.  Information has a tendency to be in constant short supply but there\u2019s just enough here to celebrate an anti-piracy achievement many years in the making. \u201cThe case further demonstrates the Premier League\u2019s commitment to protecting its intellectual property around the world,\u201d says Kevin Plumb, General Counsel at the Premier League.  \u201cThis is not only important to us and our broadcast partners, but it is essential for the future health of English football and the protection of our fans. This case perfectly shows the benefits of working alongside other rights owners. I would like to thank our co-complainants, Sky and ACE, for their trusted partnership throughout these unique and complex proceedings leading up to this conviction.\u201d Matt Hibbert, Group Director of Anti-Piracy at Sky, says the ruling sends a strong message that pirates can be brought to justice, no matter where in the world they are. \u201cThe Lebanese judicial authorities in Lebanon, in collaboration with the Lebanese Cyber Crime Bureau successfully pursued the prosecution of this individual, who has been involved in the egregious theft of content for many years.\u201d After being placed on the United States\u2019 Special 301 watchlist in 2008, Lebanon reportedly did \u201cvery little\u201d to improve its protection of intellectual property rights for the next 14 years.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":" GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.  Three \"major\" publishers could delay their upcoming games to avoid a clash with GTA 6. By      Eddie Makuch    on March 25, 2025 at 9:06AM PDT Grand Theft Auto VI is coming this year, and it's expected to be a huge success with 40 million sales and $3 billion in revenue in its first year. Its release looms so large that some publishers are apparently considering delaying their games to avoid a clash. Three anonymous \"major\" video game publishers told The Game Business that they are \"ready\" to delay upcoming projects due to GTA 6. The report didn't say what these companies are, but an anonymous boss of \"one of the world's biggest game publishers\" told TGB that Rockstar's releases \"always suck a lot of money, and more importantly, time out of the market.\" \"We don't want to be anywhere near that. We are working up multiple different plans for our titles,\" the anonymous executive said. Another unnamed senior executive at a publisher said even without GTA 6 coming to market, it's become \"immensely difficult to find free time for new games to shine. Time is the real scarcity for us, not money. It's tough out there.\" Two anonymous developers of \"top 10 live-service games\" told TBG that they are not planning any major updates to their titles around the time of GTA 6's launch. One unnamed studio boss told TGB that GTA 6 is \"basically a huge meteor and we will just stay clear of the blast zone.\" A different developer said there is \"no point\" in trying to compete with GTA 6 and it might be smarter to \"prepare to win players back once the excitement has started to die down.\" GTA 6 is officially set for release in Fall 2025 on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but every Rockstar Games release going back a decade has been delayed, so it would be notable if GTA 6 is not delayed. Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has acknowledged that GTA 6 could be delayed. Publishers being wary of launching near GTA 6 is not a new concern. At the end of 2024, it was reported that many publishers were waiting to assign release dates to their own titles until Rockstar confirmed a date for GTA 6. More recently, an analyst said some companies might not survive if they don't properly plan their launch timings around GTA 6. GTA 6 coming to market could also help lift the overall video game industry, as a game of that magnitude is expected to draw in new or lapsed players. Ubisoft, for its part, said it sees its own game sales grow when a big game like a new entry in the GTA series comes out. In related news, Greg Rice of Day of the Devs and PlayStation recently said there is a fear that GTA 6 is \"sucking all the space out\" of the industry, but this might not tell the whole story. GTA 6 is the first new entry in main series since 2013's GTA V. That game has enjoyed enormous success, selling more than 200 million copies and generating countless additional revenue from GTA Online. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"ByMichael Foster  ByMichael Foster,  Contributor.  MISTAKES TO AVOID Here\u2019s some good news in these uncertain times: Most investors who\u2019ve invested for the long haul are well-equipped to deal with this selloff. That\u2019s because, over the last five years, stocks have been on an absolute tear. In that period, the S&P 500 has delivered an average annual total return of 19.1%, as of this writing. That\u2019s more than double the average of about 8% in the last century. Think back five years for a moment. Back then, the stock market\u2019s prospects looked bleak, indeed, as we were at the beginning of the pandemic-driven selloff. In the middle of March 2020, lockdowns had just begun in the U.S. (the first one was on March 16, in San Francisco, and March 19 was the first statewide lockdown). Thinking back to that troubled period highlights something important to remember when it comes to investing: Be careful not to take the current circumstances and project them over the long run, because historically the market\u2019s long-term direction is up, especially over periods much longer than five years. Early 2020 also tells us something when it comes to trying to discern if the stock market is overpriced or underpriced: Just looking at a certain time period of stock returns to try to tell whether or not stocks are a bargain is misleading because of something called base effects.  In other words, your returns will be impacted by where you start looking, which can sometimes cause some big distortions. That\u2019s always good to bear in mind, of course. But it\u2019s still interesting to look at periods of extreme outperformance and tease out those assets that did better still. Finding one might lead us to a real gem\u2014especially if we can pick it up at a bargain. With that in mind, let\u2019s look at some funds\u2014high-yielding closed-end funds, to be precise\u2014that actually returned more than 19.1% annualized in the last five years. This is important because many wealth advisors and market gurus say that actively managed funds can\u2019t beat the market. Yet these three funds can\u2014and have\u2014even in an extremely hot market like the one we saw after COVID-19 got real. I should be honest and say right now that the reason for this outperformance is that these funds invest in corners of the market that have dominated in that time, as well as assets beyond the S&P 500. These are the main reasons why they\u2019ve outperformed. But this precisely points to why diversifying across both sectors and assets is a proven strategy\u2014it gives us exposure to some outperformance, even in the best of times. That, in turn, boosts the value of our overall portfolio in the long term while helping cushion us from sudden, nasty downturns like the one at the start of the pandemic. Or, for that matter, the one we\u2019re seeing now. Plus, these three funds have another compelling feature: big dividends. Two of them yield over 6%, and one yields 9.5%, so you can see how they don\u2019t just give us the ability to diversify\u2014they also give us the opportunity for a massive income stream that index funds just can\u2019t offer. The benchmark S&P 500 index fund, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), for example, yields just 1.2%. So, let\u2019s jump in, starting with the \u201cworst\u201d performer of our trio and wrapping up with our best. Our first fund returned an astounding 205% over the last five years. That\u2019s mainly because the Columbia Seligman Premium Technology Growth Fund (STK) focuses on tech stocks: Broadcom (AVGO), NVIDIA (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) are all top holdings. With that in mind, its outperformance is no surprise. But unlike most tech funds, STK yields 6.3%\u2014actually on the low side for CEFs, which yield around 8% on average. Even so this fund remains an unusually powerful way to draw a healthy income stream from the reality of tech encroaching on every part of our lives. There\u2019s just one issue here: When it comes to CEFs, we always strive to buy when a fund is trading at a discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio) and STK trades near par as I write this. This may mean STK will see a market-price decline to bring it to the kind of valuation its peers have. But if this smartly run fund hits a 5% discount to NAV or greater, I see it a \u201cno-brainer\u201d buy. The 31.9% annualized return we\u2019ve seen from the Adams Natural Resources Fund (PEO), which yields 9.5% today, is astounding on its surface. But if you think for a second, it makes sense: Oil was crashing five years ago and actually hit negative prices a couple weeks after the pandemic began. So crude had nowhere to go but up! And the large cap energy stocks this fund holds\u2014PEO currently has ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) and EOG Resources (EOG)\u2014naturally benefited. Plus, this fund\u2019s massive 11.7% discount to NAV is a strong value for that huge income stream, which essentially turns gains from energy stocks into income without you having to buy and sell these stocks yourself. No question about it: Brave contrarians who chose this well-run energy fund five years ago have enjoyed strong gains and healthy income. The fact that we can still get in at a discount means PEO still has appeal, despite that strong run. This last fund is our top performer of the three, and what a performance it\u2019s been. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with PIMCO, it\u2019s a specialist investment firm that operates in the bond market and has a lot of funds that outperform their indices; in the world of credit, it\u2019s considered one of the best, if not the best, there is. So the outperformance of the PIMCO Dynamic Income Strategy Fund (PDX) isn\u2019t too surprising, but the size of that outperformance certainly is. An unbelievable 47.3% annualized return over the last five years, as of this writing, makes PDX an unquestionably powerful wealth builder. But five years ago, you had to be very brave to buy it. Consider that PDX invests in junk bonds, and buying at the start of a global pandemic, during which bankruptcies were expected to be the norm, took an iron-willed contrarian indeed. As I write this, PDX yields 6%. And it\u2019s worth noting that the fund\u2019s payouts have been volatile since its inception in 2019. However, it currently trades at a 6.8% discount, which is unusual for a PIMCO fund (most trade at a premium), so we\u2019ve got an extra margin of safety and an opportunity for discount-driven upside, too, even after this fund\u2019s incredible five-year run.

{"date":"2025-03-25","content":"Crucial's P310 is a great choice for upgrading a Steam Deck or ROG Ally, and it's discounted again in Amazon's latest deal event.   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck and ROG Ally are great, we love them. But game sizes are getting increasingly large, and storage just doesn't go as far as it used to. That's why it's worth upgrading the SSD inside, and this deal on a Crucial P310 2TB SSD down to under $160 is the perfect tool for the job. Handhelds take the 2230 sized SSDs, and I used one of these Crucial P310 drives to upgrade my own handheld. It's fast, doesn't get too hot, and at this price, fantastic value.  \u2705Perfect for:\u00a0Expanding storage on a Steam Deck or ROG Ally. \u274cAvoid if:\u00a0You don't feel comfortable taking apart your handheld to install a new drive.  \ud83d\udc49See at:\u00a0Amazon \ud83d\udc49Also available: Crucial P310 1TB - $95.56 at Amazon I actually put one of these into my now ex-ROG Ally (which is in the great electronics pile in the sky now). Admittedly, I used the 1TB version, which is also currently reduced, but I always wished I'd gone for the larger capacity that's on offer here. Obviously, the main caveat is that you're comfortable opening up your handheld, putting in a new SSD, and then reinstalling the OS. On the ROG Ally, this is particularly straightforward, with ASUS having a handy tool to reflash it from the cloud. The Steam Deck is a little more of a process, needing a USB-C thumbstick to flash SteamOS from, but in both cases, actually installing the drive is quite simple. Just go slowly and have patience. We have a guide on upgrading the SSD on both the Steam Deck and the ROG Ally if you need assistance. In the case of the ROG Ally, besides doubling the storage of my base 512GB model, it added additional performance, too. The Crucial P310 is much faster at both read and write than the stock SSD in that handheld, so, you know, if you crave speed, you'll get it here. But most of all you're getting significantly more space for all those lovely games you want to play. Amazon's Big Spring Sale isn't on for long, so this discount won't be hanging about. Grab one while you can, you won't regret it. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
