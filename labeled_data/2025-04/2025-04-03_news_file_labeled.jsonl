{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  US stocks ended their worst day in almost five years on Thursday, with investors rattled by President Donald Trump's tariffs and the looming prospect of a bruising global trade war.           The market cratered at the open, with the sell-off gaining steam throughout the session. By the closing bell, the S&P 500 had lost nearly 5%, its worst single-day loss since June 2020.        Here's where major US indexes stood at the 4:00 p.m. closing bell on Thursday:        Samp;P 500: 5,396.60, down 4.84%   Dow Jones Industrial Average: 40,545.87, down 3.98% (-1,679.45 points)   Nasdaq Composite: 16,550.61, down 5.97%            Treasury yields plunged as investors sought safety amid the chaos and as markets eyed greater odds of a recession. The 10-year US Treasury yield fell 15 basis points to 4.045%, its lowest level since October.               Investors are positioning for tariffs to hurt business activity and economic growth.                \"The tariffs were higher than expected, and therefore, markets hadn't fully priced in this magnitude. Wall Street is essentially repricing,\" Michael Farr, CEO and founder of investment advisory firm Farr, Miller & Washington, told Business Insider on Thursday. \"The question is how much repricing is still to come.\"               Bank of America analysts said that the hit to S&P 500 earnings could be as high as 32% in the event countries retaliate with their own tariffs, and the general mood on Wall Street on Thursday was that more pain for stocks is likely.                Yeap Jun Rong, an IG market strategist, described the tariffs as a \"major shock,\" adding that Trump's announcement was \"far more hawkish\" than expected. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives called them \"worse than the worst-case scenario.\"               Trump's tariffs are also rattling seasoned forecasters.               \"This is a game changer, not only for the US economy but for the global economy. Many countries will likely end up in a recession,\" wrote Olu Sonola, the head of US economic research at Fitch Ratings, in a note on Wednesday.               European stock indexes dropped Thursday as investors punished companies they expected to be squeezed by Trump's tariffs. Goods from the European Union will be subject to a 20% tariff and goods from the UK will be subject to a 10% levy.               The European Commission's president, Ursula von der Leyen, said in a televised statement that the European Union was finalizing its response to Trump's previous tariffs on steel and that it was \"now preparing for further countermeasures to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail.\"               Germany's DAX fell 3%, Britain's FTSE 100 slid 1.5%, France's CAC 40 lost 3.3%, and the Euro Stoxx 50 dropped 3.6%.       Gold hit a fresh record of nearly $3,160 an ounce before reversing course. Gold bullion \u2014 one of the few commodities exempted from the tariffs per a White House fact sheet \u2014 rose as much as 0.8% at Thursday's open in Asia before falling slightly during the day.               Investors have flocked to the precious metal this year in a flight to safety amid rising macroeconomic uncertainty.               In contrast, bitcoin fell as traders sold off risky assets. Oil futures declined on mounting fears of an economic slowdown.               The US dollar also fell against other major currencies.               Asian markets sold off following the tariff declaration, reflecting the region's exposure to the new levies.               Trump announced a 34% tax on imports from China, on top of an existing duty of 20%, bringing the total tariff to 54%.               \"China firmly opposes this and will take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests,\" China's Commerce Ministry said in a statement.               US allies Japan and South Korea face 24% and 25% tariffs, respectively, unless the countries' leaders can strike a deal to avoid them.       Southeast Asian countries \u2014 many of which have become supply chain hubs for companies diversifying manufacturing activities from China \u2014 are some of the most affected by the new US tariffs.               Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia face tariffs of 46%, 36%, 32%, and 24%, respectively.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Trump's new tariffs elicited threats of retaliation from foreign leaders. U.S. stocks suffered major losses on Thursday at close of the first trading session after President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 1,679 points, or nearly 4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined almost 6%. The S&P 500 tumbled 4.8%, marking its worst trading day since 2020. The selloff hammered shares of some major multinational corporations with supply chains abroad. Nike plummeted 14%, while Apple fell 9%. E-commerce giant Amazon slid nearly 9%. Shares fell for each of the other so-called \"Magnificent Seven,\" a group of large tech firms that helped drive stock market gains in recent years. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, dropped nearly 9%. Chipmaker Nvidia slid 7%. Tesla, the electric carmaker led by Trump-advisor Elon Musk, declined 5%. Shares of U.S. retailers that depend largely on imported products also tumbled, with Dollar Tree down 13% and Five Below seeing 27% losses. While Trump said the tariffs would free the U.S. from dependence on foreign goods, fears of a deepened international trade war appeared to influence the stock market reaction. During the event at the White House on Wednesday, Trump unveiled a sweeping set of baseline tariffs on all trading partners and what he described as \"kind reciprocal\" tariffs on nations he claimed were the worst offenders in trade relations with the U.S. \"My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day,\" Trump said from the Rose Garden. \"April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,\" he said. The president announced the measures would\u00a0include a minimum baseline tariff of 10% on all trading partners and, further, more targeted punitive levies on certain countries, including\u00a0China, the European Union and Taiwan. Trump held up a chart with a list of nations and what the new U.S. tariffs against them will be. At the top was China, which Trump said was set to be hit with a 34% tariff rate as he claimed it charged the United States 67%. The 34% reciprocal rate for China is in addition to a previous 20% tariff Trump slapped on the nation -- bringing the effective tariff rate on one of the U.S.'s biggest trading partners to 54% total. While the longstanding effects of Trump's newly minted tariffs stand to be seen, some experts told ABC News ahead of Wednesday that the measures could threaten economic growth and employment since duties slapped on imports risk increasing costs for businesses that rely on raw materials from abroad. \"If both businesses and consumers start to worry and pull back their spending, that is what can tip the U.S. over into a recession,\" Kara Reynolds, an economist at American University, previously told ABC News. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, described the tariffs as \"the fodder for an economic downturn.\" ABC News' Max Zahn contributed to this report. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":1}
{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"There are situations in which tariffs are a useful tool to address a trade deficit, or to protect key sectors of a country\u2019s economy. Then there are situations where you accuse a bunch of penguins on an uninhabited island of currency manipulation. Guess which one we\u2019re living in? This is the takeaway of the manifold tariffs announced by President Donald Trump on Wednesday afternoon. In addition to the penguin-occupied Heard and McDonald Islands, the tariffs target the British Indian Ocean Territory, whose sole occupants live on a joint US-UK military base on Diego Garcia island. Yes, the United States is levying reciprocal tariffs against its own troops. And then there are the tariffs against countries that have actual goods and services on which US consumers depend. China: 54 percent. Vietnam: 46 percent. Cambodia: 49 percent. South Korea: 25 percent. No corner of the US consumer economy will go untouched. Prices will rise. The stock market is spiraling. A recession looms. The tech industry will be turned upside down. Mark Cuban, noted billionaire, is encouraging people to stockpile consumables before it\u2019s too late. It\u2019s reckless, it\u2019s absurd, and it\u2019s also everything Donald Trump said plainly he would do on the campaign trail. True, he didn\u2019t telegraph how misguided the methodology would be\u2014you can read about it more here, but suffice to say it\u2019s thoroughly detached from the realities of international trade\u2014but he loudly, repeatedly promised to tariff his way to glory. The stated goal is to return manufacturing jobs to the United States, which is a bit like resurrecting the dodo. The US still manufactures plenty of goods; it\u2019s second only to China in annual output, according to the World Bank. But many of the industry\u2019s jobs have been replaced by automation, a bottle you can\u2019t re-cork. And higher domestic labor costs mean US-made products will inherently be more expensive, a trade-off American consumers have consistently rejected. All of this was already true in Trump\u2019s first term. It\u2019s even more so now. And let\u2019s say a plurality of companies did decide to reshore or set up factories in the United States. The timeline for those decisions and implementation is measured in years, if not decades, and follow-through can be spotty. (Just ask Foxconn.) So what happens in the meantime? The rationale has all the weight of a soap bubble. There isn\u2019t a world where the US suddenly manufactures all the items the country has decided to target. There\u2019s a 47 percent tariff on Madagascar now. Do you know why the US has a trade deficit with Madagascar? They produce vanilla; we don\u2019t. Unless we\u2019re suddenly setting up vanilla assembly lines in Ohio, that\u2019s not changing. But maybe Trump\u2019s so-called Liberation Day is all just a master negotiating ploy. \u201cEverybody sit back, take a deep breath. Don\u2019t immediately retaliate. Let\u2019s see where this goes,\u201d said Treasury secretary Scott Bessent on CNN Wednesday. \u201cBecause if you retaliate, that\u2019s how we get escalation.\u201d It\u2019s an interesting tactic, to start a bar brawl and ask everyone not to punch back in case someone gets hurt. It\u2019s not working. China has already vowed to retaliate; the EU suggested that it could as well. (New Zealand is officially chill.) Set the economics of this aside for a moment, though. The insult on top of that looming injury is how sloppy this all is. It\u2019s the same blunt-force destruction that DOGE has implemented within the US government, that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has imposed on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, now projected on a global scale. Yes, Elon Musk and DOGE have taken a blowtorch to federal agencies. But the tariffs are a helpful reminder that it's Trump who's fiddling while it all burns. It\u2019s the instinct to measure wins in units of pain and suffering. It\u2019s an assumption that the only way to help yourself is to hurt other people. This is just what America is now. The optimist\u2019s case is that this is all a feint, that other countries will capitulate or at least make enough of a show of it that things will go back to normal. Seems unlikely. First of all, they\u2019re already doing the opposite, all apologies to Bessent. But even if they weren\u2019t, even if this is just posturing from the US, that posturing has consequences. Whatever equity the US has built up over the last century as a reputable trade partner has been largely wiped out by a businessman-president best known for his bankruptcies. And then there\u2019s the pessimist\u2019s case, which also seems increasingly like the realist\u2019s. The US is barreling toward a recession for no good reason, and dragging the world\u2014and a few thousand penguins on remote Antarctic islands\u2014down with it.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"        Laurel Wamsley                        A 'For Sale' sign is posted in front of a home for sale last month in Pasadena, Calif.                                                           Mario Tama\/Getty Images\/Getty Images North America                                       hide caption  It's springtime, and \"For Sale\" signs are popping up in front of homes across the country. But with so much uncertainty in the economy, it's an open question whether the spring housing market will be hot \u2026 or not. Let's check out the forecast. It's certainly not the cheapest time to buy a home. The average 30-year mortgage rate is now 6.65%, down a bit from January, but still pretty high. Many analysts predict that mortgage rates will linger around this level for now, especially since the Federal Reserve has indicated it's unlikely to cut interest rates until later this year. Selma Hepp, chief economist at real estate analysis firm Cotality, says market volatility could bring down mortgage rates. That's because mortgages typically follow the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds, which are affected by investors' worries about the economy. \"Because of the concerns around a slowing job market, because of concerns maybe about rising risks of a recession,\" Hepp says. But there are other factors keeping mortgage rates high \u2013 among them, inflationary policies like tariffs. Another deterrent for buyers is the elevated cost to buy a home. The median home price has shot up 47% in just the last five years. Last year was the slowest existing home sales market since 1995. It's wasn't that people didn't want to buy -- there simply wasn't much for sale. The big question now is whether a frozen market can begin to thaw. Signs suggest things are starting to shift, with more inventory coming on the market.  In February, there were 17% more existing homes for sale compared to last year, followed by a 10% increase in new listings in March compared to a year ago. In the last couple years, as mortgage rates climbed, there's been concern about a \"lock-in effect\" causing homeowners with low interest rates to never move. But the recent uptick in listings suggests that as time goes on, people do end up moving. More listings should translate to more sales. Return to office mandates are also spurring some folks to move closer to cities, now that they've got to be in the office several days a week. Increased inventory will put buyers on better footing, giving them more options and more leverage. For sellers, more competition could mean they have to be more flexible on price. That's already starting to happen. Over 17% of active listings included price reductions in March, according to Realtor.com -- the highest for any March since 2016.  Jeremy Masem, 40, is trying to become a homeowner. For the past year, he and his wife have been looking for a home in Fairfield County, Conn. A few weeks ago, they offered $161,000 over a home's asking price. But their bid still wasn't enough. This week, they lost again \u2013 theirs was one of 17 offers. Masem says they may decide to just keep renting for a while. \"I am a little nervous ... All the various tariffs,\" he says. \"What's going to happen? What's not going to happen? Maybe just waiting and seeing for another year or two would be in our best interest.\" Others may be making that same choice. Pending listings \u2014 that is, homes under contract \u2014 fell 5.2% year over year in March, according to data from Realtor.com. Those who are worried about losing their jobs might not want to commit to a big down payment right now. \"They tend to stay put,\" says Hepp at Cotality. \"They end up not moving unless they have to.\" Also adding to the uncertainty is that costs of homeownership that used to be pretty steady, like home insurance or HOA fees, have skyrocketed in some places. That can make buying a home feel like more of a gamble than it used to. Last year, a settlement with the National Association of Realtors led to a few big changes for both buyers and sellers. Before these new rules went into effect, sellers would typically pay both their own agent and the buyers' agent. Now, that's no longer a given. It's up to the seller whether to pay the buyer's agent\u2014and how much. A second big change is that now buyers who want to work with a real estate agent must sign an agreement that sets the agent's compensation \u2013 before they can go see any homes.  So, pretty much the only way to see a home without signing something these days, is to go to an open house \u2013- or represent yourself and reach out to listing agents directly. Many real estate agents say the system really hasn't changed much. But the new rules mean more things to negotiate amid what can already be a tricky process in a very expensive transaction. \"There's still confusion over who's paying whose percentage,\" says Masem, the Connecticut home shopper. He says the whole process of looking at homes and making offers can be draining and time-consuming. \"A lot of our free time is spent looking at this stuff,\" says Masem. \"I feel like we're missing out on just regular things we would like to do.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor","label":0}
{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  RH's CEO had a very relatable reaction when he heard his stock was plunging: \"Oh shit.\"          On an earnings call on Wednesday for the company previously known as Restoration Hardware, Gary Friedman cursed when he found out RH's stock fell 26% after hours as investors reacted to a major tariff announcement.           \"We're just really well positioned right now. I think that's the headline. If you're going to bet on somebody in this race, and what's our stock now?\" Friedman said. \"Oh really? Oh shit, okay. I just looked at the screen.\"               Friedman said that the stock was hit after Wednesday's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs were announced because investors recognized the company gets most of its luxury home goods from affected countries.               In the year that ended in February, RH reported that 72% of its products were sourced from Asia, with significant chunks coming from Vietnam and China. The rest of its Asia goods come from India and Indonesia, the company said Wednesday.               On Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced a 34% retaliatory tariff on China and 46% tariffs on Vietnam. India and Indonesia were hit with 26% and 32% in duties, respectively.               Friedman said that other home decor and furnishing businesses were going through a similar challenge.               \"I know most of the businesses pretty well,\" he said. \"So we're all in the same boat.\"               RH acknowledged that tariffs could hit its business in its annual report. The company said in the filing that it had begun moving its supply chain away from higher-tariff countries \u2014 but that might not be enough.               \"Significant uncertainty exists as to whether and when tariffs may be reduced or imposed, and what countries may be implicated. Given that we cannot reasonably predict the timing or outcomes of trade actions by the US government or other countries, the impact of such actions on our business and results of operations remains uncertain,\" the company wrote.               On Wednesday's call, Friedman also highlighted the challenging US housing market.               \"We've been operating in the worst housing market in almost 50 years,\" he said.               He said that in 1978, 4.09 million existing homes were sold in the US, which had a population of 223 million. In 2024, 4.06 million existing homes were sold \u2014 when the US had 340 million people \u2014 which \"illuminates just how depressed the housing market has been this past year.\"               \"Despite that fact, we are performing at the level most would expect in a robust housing market,\" he said.               RH reported a 5% increase in 2024 revenue to $3.18 billion, compared to last year. Its stock is down over 37% so far this year.               Governments use import tariffs to encourage local manufacturing, but they drive up the cost of production for businesses that rely on foreign raw materials. These duties are likely to raise prices for everyday goods Americans use. While companies might choose to absorb a portion of the costs, customers usually shoulder most of the burden.               \"April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,\" Trump said during Wednesday remarks.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"     New tariff policies have prompted a huge sell-off in the US stock markets and uncertainty for investors.    Plunging US stock prices have created much confusion for investors. The long-term impact of the new US tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump may be uncertain, but the short-term effects have been obvious -- stock prices in the leading US markets are crumbling.\u00a0 After the new tariffs were announced late Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 1,647 points on Thursday and has fallen another 2,000 points, or nearly 5%, on Friday. \"It is very difficult for businesses to plan in this chaotic tariff environment created by the Trump administration,\" said Robert Johnson, CEO of Economic Index Associates and professor of finance at Creighton University's Heider College of Business. Markets usually react negatively to tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods that usually drive up prices for consumers and stifle global trade. While escalating tariff threats are eroding both consumer and corporate confidence, cuts to the federal workforce are causing households to curb spending and sparking fears of a recession. \"This can result in an economic slowdown,\" Johnson said.\u00a0 A number of other factors are also contributing to stock market volatility, such as inflation, interest rate forecasts and fears of increased military conflict. Wall Street briefly rallied after the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate steady on March 19, but the forecast for higher inflation and lower economic growth in 2025 then sent stocks lower again.\u00a0 \"The stock market is affected both by reality and perception,\" said Rick Miller, a financial and investment adviser at Miller Investment Management. \"What people believe is happening is often as impactful as what the actual market conditions may be.\"\u00a0 Though a 10% dip in the stock market can be stressful, it's also pretty normal. The stock market has always recovered from steeper drops, including most recently the Great Recession and the COVID-19 meltdown. If you're nervous about your investments, like the state of your 401(k), financial experts say not to panic. While it can be painful to watch your investments shrink, it's not always a safer bet to change your strategy, especially if you're several years away from retirement. If you're in your 30s to early 50s, time is on your side to ride this out and play the long game.\u00a0 However, if you're on the cusp of retiring or you plan to retire early, Miller said you may want to cash in your qualified plans to preserve what you've built over the years.\u00a0 Despite the stock market's historical track record of bouncing back after downturns, retirees (or those approaching retirement) may be unable to afford the time it takes to recover. For example, after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, the market began to gain steam, but then the 2007-09 financial crisis hit. The stock market didn't fully recover until 2013. What's key is protecting your financial security. For example, as long as you don't withdraw money from your retirement accounts, selling assets within qualified workplace plans, like 401(k)s or IRAs, won't result in a tax bill no matter what your age.\u00a0 \"Cushion the effects a bit by making your qualified plan contributions aggressive until the markets stabilize,\" Miller said. It's a way to benefit from upward momentum in the market while keeping your nest egg safe from any further drops. Given the economy's broader problems, stocks are likely to bounce around a bit. Most financial advisers recommend against changing your strategy based on the latest stock market ups and downs. \"The best advice for long-term investors is to establish an investment plan and to stick to it,\" he said. It's generally wise to avoid selling in a panic. By doing so, you could be going against the general guidance for investing, which is to buy low and sell high.\u00a0 Financial planners often recommend using what's called a dollar-cost averaging strategy, where you invest a set amount each month regardless of market conditions. This approach takes some of the emotion out of investing and allows you to lock in low prices during stock market dips, even if you pay more when the market surges. Still, if you do choose to take advantage of lower prices, just keep in mind that the timing of a recovery is unpredictable. \"Even regular investors should consider 'buying low' when top quality companies experience price declines not seen for years,\" said Miller.\u00a0","label":1}
{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Economically speaking, 2025 is off to a rough start. Trend forecasters see more signs of a downturn in the latest runways.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Recession 2025 warning signs are swirling everywhere\u2014for those willing to look. There are, of course, straightforward analyses from business journalists and financial experts. The S&P 500 ended March with its worst performance since December 2022. A CNBC study showed that a majority of chief financial officers\u2014the corporate leaders who pay close attention to daily market fluctuations alongside their companies' profits\u2014reported feeling \"pessimistic\" about the U.S. economy. And ahead of President Donald J. Trump's unveiling of the \"Liberation Day\" tariff plans on April 2, economic experts agreed that the taxes on foreign imports will contribute to a downturn, if not an all-out recession. Though the signs aren't all coded in stock-market moves and CNN alerts. Look closely at recent runway collections and spending trends; you'll notice tangible signs of economic uncertainty. Recession indicators, but make them fashion. Some trends, like spikes in corporate suiting and lengthening skirt hemlines, have come and gone with each economic cycle for roughly the past century. (The latter forms the basis of the controversial \"hemline index,\" which suggests that skirts lengthen as the economy worsens\u2014and when things look up and people get into party mode, minis return.) Others resemble one-off relics that were hugely popular during (or just before) the last significant U.S. economic downturn (the Great Recession, which spanned from roughly December 2007 to June 2009). I've seen the return of Chlo\u00e9's Paddington bag, Alexander McQueen's skull print, and Prada's built-in necklace necklines labeled as \"recession indicators\" online by editors in my professional circles. The same goes for Dior's J'Adore Dior logo T-shirts and the bootcut denim comeback. They're ghosts of the '08 crash that no one is particularly nostalgic for, but everyone remembers vividly.  Models at Chlo\u00e9, Alexander McQueen, and Dior wore styles repurposed from mid-aughts collections in the Fall 2025 shows\u2014which viewers took to calling \"recession indicators.\"  Sure, some of the items listed above haven't been seen en masse since the first Obama Administration. A gauzy skull scarf print or a pre-embellished beaded neckline could transport any fashion enthusiast straight back to 2008\u2014hence the wink-wink, nudge-nudge nickname online. But these items aren't as much of a true recession indicator as the broader trends that evolve from collection to collection and brand to brand. (Plus, what creative director would intentionally delve into their archive with the goal of evoking memories of a year without much shopping?) The real recession indicators in fashion are reflected in trending searches for simple suiting, neutral colors, and conservatively long hemlines\u2014categories that last peaked in the mid-2000s and tend to represent a world-weary, budget-conscious consumer. Mad\u00e9 Lapuerta, who analyzes search behavior on the account @databutmakeitfashion, notes that interest in maxi skirts rose by 393 percent in March; \"minimalist\" and \"corporate\" styles increased by 39 and 38 percent, respectively. These items initially reflect a more somber mood\u2014the aesthetic opposite of the one percent's loud luxury and sequin-bedecked party wear. (If you can't buy eggs, you certainly aren't buying logo-coated bags and megawatt watches.) Minimalist styles are also inherently practical and can justify their cost-per-wear in a matter of weeks. If spare change for shopping dries up, they'll still look stylish.  Corporate coded clothing during fashion month street style shows even fashion people are trying to stretch their clothes' lifespans.  Muted colors, covered silhouettes, and pared-back details were equally prevalent in the lead-up to the Great Recession, according to FIT Fashion Business Management Professor Vincent Quan. \"With discretionary spending limited, consumers 'traded down' by purchasing value-priced items, including apparel and accessories, which offered a haven from fashion trends,\" he explains. \"The focus on minimalism contrasted sharply with the maximalist aesthetic that prevailed during the economic boom period prior to 2007.\" Get exclusive access to fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. 360-degree basics\u2014in shape, color, and cut\u2014naturally have increased utility. Their rise as a way to \"look rich\" for less is no coincidence. \"Less conspicuous purchases and minimalistic dressing trends may be a harbinger of what lies ahead,\" Quan says. The business expert also noticed that skirts are getting longer on the Fall 2025 runways, interpreting it as a sign of \"volatility.\" Designers don't know what's going to happen to the global economy\u2014but they seem just as on-edge as their shoppers, and are creating accordingly.  Midi and maxi skirts returned to popularity during fashion month\u2014another sign of a downward-trending market.  Before 2025 kicked off with tariff panic and empty egg shelves, Pantone selected \"Mocha Mousse\" as the color of the year. Color trend analysts tried to frame it as a comforting shade: \"It embodies stability, reliability, and timeless appeal,\" one expert previously shared with Marie Claire. But in the context of a flowing skirt or a set of basics\u2014particularly in a piece that could be perceived as trend-proof\u2014 it might also signify another recession indicator lurking in plain sight.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"The company has raised prices before during supply chain disruptions, but for now, it\u2019s taking a wait-and-see approach on potential \u201cimplications.\u201d The company has raised prices before during supply chain disruptions, but for now, it\u2019s taking a wait-and-see approach on potential \u201cimplications.\u201d by  Chris Welch Even with all the self-induced turmoil that Sonos has been through over the last year, if you\u2019ve been eyeing any of the company\u2019s products, it might be wise to buy sooner than later. In an email, spokesperson Erin Pategas tells me that Sonos is \u201cclosely monitoring developments related to the proposed tariffs and actively assessing potential implications for our business, customers, and supply chain. At this time our focus remains on delivering the best audio experiences for our customers.\u201d That\u2019s less optimistic framing than the company gave only a couple months ago, but for good reason. Like many other tech companies, Sonos thought it would be in a good position after mixing up its supply chain beyond China to other production hubs. On the company\u2019s most recent earnings call, chief financial officer Saori Casey said the following: \u201cYou may recall we underwent a significant effort to diversify our supply chain a few years ago, which resulted in a manufacturing of nearly all of our U.S.-bound products shifting to Malaysia and Vietnam. As a result, we expect tariffs to have a minimal impact to our gross margin in Q2 based on what we know today.\u201d So much for that. The sweeping proposals announced yesterday by President Trump place a 46 percent tariff on Vietnam and 24 percent on Malaysia, making this strategy far less effective than Sonos likely hoped. The Santa Barbara-based brand is a relatively small company that already operates on thin hardware margins, so it can\u2019t afford to simply absorb the cost of these tariffs. Sonos\u2019 stock slid 15 percent on news of Trump\u2019s far-reaching plans. \u201cOur inventory consists of $117 million of finished goods and $24 million of components,\u201d Casey said in February. Just this week, Sonos lowered the price of two products, the Era 100 soundbar and Ray soundbar, to $199. Should Trump\u2019s tariffs actually go into effect, it\u2019s not unthinkable that those cuts could be reversed in the not-too-distant future. Sonos last raised prices across its product lineup in 2021 amid a global supply chain crunch. But for now, as Pategas\u2019 statement underlines, the company is concentrating its focus on improving its core user experience \u2014 and that mobile app. A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe. \u00a9 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  Tesla just can't seem to catch a break.          The company's stock has fallen amid a backlash against CEO Elon Musk, and its latest delivery report on Wednesday showed its car sales business is fundamentally in trouble.               The company's Q1 deliveries dropped 13% from the previous year to just 336,700, well short of analysts' forecasts. Dan Ives, who's typically bullish on the automaker, called the figures \"a disaster\" that showed the automaker is in a \"full-blown crisis.\"               Business Insider spoke to some of the auto industry's keenest observers about what the company needs to do to turn things around.               While the political backlash against Musk has grabbed headlines, Sean Tucker, the lead editor for Kelley Blue Book, told BI that Tesla's aging product lineup could be a big reason deliveries were falling.               He said the carmaker has been grappling with a downward trend in delivery numbers since February 2023.               \"They grew from 2020 to 2023, and then they started shrinking,\" Tucker said, citing data from Kelley Blue Book that found Tesla hit a peak of 60,325 monthly US sales in February 2023.               The automaker began selling a revamped version of its bestselling Model Y earlier this year but it hasn't launched a new vehicle since the Cybertruck in 2023.               While the Cybertruck was the top-selling vehicle in the small EV truck market in 2024, the pickup has failed to boost Tesla's sales numbers. In the first quarter of this year, the company sold just 12,881 \"other models,\" which include the Cybertruck, Model S, and Model X.               Michael Lenox, a business professor and an EV industry expert at the University of Virginia's Darden School of Business, told BI that European and Chinese manufacturers now have EV models that are \"eating into\" the lead Tesla once had.               \"We've just seen massive entry by all the global existing incumbent auto manufacturers,\" he added.               Stephanie Valdez Streaty, the director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told BI that the number of EVs on the US market had ballooned from around 19 in 2020 to 78.               She said that's made the\u00a0launch of an affordable EV, which Tesla has said is set to go into production in the first half of 2025, even more crucial to the company.               \"They need a new model that's affordable because affordability has been a huge issue for consumers,\" said Valdez Streaty.               She said that with average new vehicle prices in the US now close to $50,000 and tariffs set to raise prices even further, the time is ripe for Tesla to launch a mass-market EV \u2014 especially as the company's factories in the US could shield it somewhat from the tariffs.               \"Tesla has said in the past that they are between two waves of growth, so they need something to propel them to that next growth wave,\" Valdez Streaty said.               While some might consider an under-$30,000 vehicle Tesla's saving grace, Tucker said that the company hasn't indicated its affordable EV will necessarily be a high-volume product. He said it would likely be a new version of a Model 3 or Model Y with a smaller battery or different battery technology.               \"That's not really a compelling high-volume product that's going to win them a bunch of sales, at least in the United States,\" Tucker said.               Lenox said Tesla also needed to focus on \"pushing the technology forward so they can get more capacity and lower cost out of the battery.\"               Lenox told BI that Tesla's Chinese competitor\u00a0BYD\u00a0not only has more models on the road but also dominates the battery value chain. BYD reported 416,00 deliveries in the first quarter Tuesday, far more than Tesla.               BYD's latest advancement in charging strengthens its position as a leading global EV company, Lenox said.               BYD recently announced new chargers that it said could add almost 250 miles of range to an EV in five minutes. The 1,000-kilowatt chargers are four times as powerful as Tesla's current 250-kilowatt chargers, which Tesla has said can add 200 miles of range in 15 minutes. Tesla plans to roll out 500-kilowatt chargers this year, but that's still half the output BYD claims to be able to provide.               Tucker added that Tesla has \"nothing particularly exciting in the pipeline\" on the tech front. Teslas are built on a 400-volt system, and most rivals are now built on an 800-volt system, which allows for faster charging and better performance.               While Tesla is due to launch its robotaxi service in Austin this summer, Tucker said that Tesla's rivals have already launched robotaxis \u2014 and struggled to make them profitable.               \"Maybe Tesla has some secret sauce that it can make it work in a way that GM didn't,\" Tucker said. \"But even if it did, I don't know that anyone goes out and buys a Tesla because they enjoyed driving in Tesla's robotaxi.\"                Tesla has traditionally been reluctant to advertise, preferring to rely on Elon Musk's social media and word of mouth.               He said in 2019 that he \"hates\" advertising, and the automaker only began ramping up its ad spending in 2023 after shareholders asked about it.               Tesla's ad-lite approach may have worked when the company was the only EV game in town \u2014 but now that competition is on the rise and with damage to Tesla's brand mounting, Valdez Streaty said the automaker could benefit from a marketing blitz.               She said, \"There's more competition, and how do you kind of elevate your brand or your models when there's so much out there?\"               Tesla has benefited from endorsements from Musk's ally, President Donald Trump. Last month, Trump marveled at a fleet of Tesla vehicles at a press event on the White House lawn. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick even told people to buy the dip as the company's stock fell.               These were in response to protests, vandalism, and attacks against the company over Musk's involvement with the administration and his other political interventions. Analysts have cited politics as part of the reason for the company's stock decline.               Sales, too, will likely be affected if the anti-Tesla movement continues, Tucker said.               \"Not a lot of people are going to cross a picket line to buy a car,\" he added.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced that massive tariffs will be applied to imports from many countries, starting April 9. The tariffs will significantly impact Apple's supply chain, with iPhones and other products imported to the U.S. from China, India, and Vietnam set to face 54%, 26%, and 46% tariffs, respectively. Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today said that if Apple does not raise prices, its overall gross profit margin could face a significant drop of 8.5% to 9%, due to the tariffs significantly raising costs. However, he outlined five ways in which Apple can reduce the impact of the tariffs on its gross margins going forward:  Apple's overall gross margin was 46% in the 2024 fiscal year. Gross margin is a profitability metric that indicates the percentage of money that Apple earns on a product like an iPhone after subtracting the costs of making the product. Even if Apple's gross margin drops below 40%, Kuo believes this dip \"should be short-lived.\" Apple's stock price dropped more than 9% since Trump's announcement.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  Many people could be left disappointed when they open their IRA statements in the coming days \u2014 and President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs threaten to make things even worse.          The S&P 500 fell 5% in the first three months of 2025, marking its worst quarter since 2022, while the Nasdaq Composite slumped 10% as stocks like Tesla plunged 36%.               Those declines have taken a bite out of many people's investments in the stock market, and could disrupt their retirement plans if they continue.               \"For the small investor, the decline in value will be devastating, particularly for retired baby boomers\" who draw their incomes from their retirement accounts, Peter Ricchiuti, a senior professor of finance at Tulane University's Freeman School of Business, told Business Insider.               The sell-off is partly in reaction to Trump's topsy-turvy tariffs in recent weeks, which have made it \"impossible\" for business owners to make decisions, Ricchiuti said.               The former investment manager, who once oversaw Louisiana's $3 billion portfolio as the assistant state treasurer, said that running a company has become a \"game of Whack-A-Mole\" because everyone is trying to guess which industry will be hit next.               Trump unveiled tariffs of at least 10% on imports from virtually all foreign countries on Wednesday, with higher rates for nations with a large trade deficit with the US. Goods from China, the number-two exporter to the US after Mexico, will be subject to a 54% tariff from April 9 if nothing changes.               The news sent the S&P down almost 5% on Thursday, as key constituents Tesla and Nvidia tumbled by about 6% and 8% respectively.               Tariffs push up costs for companies and prices for consumers, while uncertainty discourages hiring, expansion, and spending. Those forces slow corporate earnings growth, eroding valuations and sending stocks lower, Ricchiuti said.               Strategists at Goldman Sachs cut their S&P 500 forecast last week, citing the incoming tariffs as their main rationale. They predicted the index would decline a further 5% this quarter and gain 6% over the next 12 months, down from 0% and 16%, respectively.               One pressing concern is that Trump ratcheting up import taxes will cause countries around the world to retaliate by imposing reciprocal tariffs on imports from the US. Ricchiuti said that's one reason why tariffs never succeed in leveling terms of trade and instead act as \"prosperity killers.\"               During Trump's first term, he imposed sweeping tariffs on goods ranging from steel and aluminum to solar panels and washing machines, and broad-based duties on imports from China. The tariffs led to material price increases and reductions in Americans' real income, studies have found.               Another worry for investors and everyday Americans alike is that if tariffs lead consumers to cut back on spending and companies to retrench, overall economic growth could suffer. Ricchiuti flagged there is mounting concern on Wall Street that Trump's trade battles will \"cause a recession or even the much-feared stagflation.\"               BlackRock CEO Larry Fink described the national mood in his yearly letter on Monday.               \"I hear it from nearly every client, nearly every leader \u2014 nearly every person \u2014 I talk to: They're more anxious about the economy than any time in recent memory,\" he wrote.               Another wave of tariff chaos is now threatening to hit stocks that have already retreated. The timing is terrible for boomers living off their nest eggs, who could see their retirement funds dwindle if they're pulling money out at the same time their stock holdings are falling in value.               Ricchiuti bemoaned that the economy was on a good path with falling inflation and record corporate earnings and stock prices ahead of Trump's inauguration.               \"The worst part of all this is that these economic wounds are self-inflicted,\" he said.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Key Asian indexes led the slide on Thursday after Trump unveiled the measures. Foreign stock markets tumbled on Thursday morning following President Donald Trump's announcement of a raft of tariffs on America's trade partners -- including a minimum baseline tariff of 10% on all nations. American trading partners reacted to Trump's tariffs announcement with condemnation and concern, warning that the measures could touch off a far-reaching and costly trade war. China -- hit with 34% tariffs on top of 20% tariffs Trump previously announced -- urged the U.S. to \"immediately cancel its unilateral tariff measures and properly resolve differences with its trading partners through equal dialogue,\" a Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said in a statement. The tariffs will \"endanger global economic development and the stability of the supply chain,\" they added. The European Union -- now facing a 20% tariff -- is prepared to respond,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. \"The universal tariffs announced by the U.S. are a major blow to businesses and consumers worldwide,\" von der Leyen wrote in a post to X on Thursday. \"We'll always protect our interests and values,\" she added. \"We're also ready to engage. And to go from confrontation to negotiation.\" Asian markets led the global stock market slide on Thursday morning. Japan's Nikkei index dropped 4% after opening, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index slid 2.4%, South Korea's KOSPI fell 2.7% and Australia's ASX 200 fell 2%. In Europe, the pan-continental STOXX 600 index fell 1.5% to a two-month low. Germany's DAX fell nearly 2.5%, the French CAC 40 slipped 2.2% and Spain's IBEX index dropped 1.5%. Britain's FTSE 100 index lost 1.5%. U.S. markets closed up ahead of Trump's Wednesday Rose Garden presentation, but stock futures dropped on Wednesday night. Dow Jones futures plummeted 2.7%, S&P 500 futures sank 3.9% and futures tied to the NASDAQ 100 dropped 4.7%. European leaders were quick to warn of potential knock-on effects. In a Facebook post, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni called the tariffs targeted toward the European Union \"wrong.\" She added, \"We will do everything we can to work towards an agreement with the United States, with the aim of avoiding a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global players.\" German Vice Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck said Wednesday should be remembered as \"inflation day\" for American consumers. \"The U.S. mania for tariffs could set off a spiral that could also pull countries into recession and cause massive damage worldwide,\" Habeck said. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Trump \"acted for his country, and that is his mandate. Today, I will act in Britain's interests with mine.\" The U.K. is facing a 10% tariff on all its goods. \"Clearly, there will be an economic impact from the decisions the U.S. has taken, both here and globally,\" Starmer added. \"But I want to be crystal clear: we are prepared, indeed one of the great strengths of this nation is our ability to keep a cool head.\" In Japan, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said Tokyo \"once again conveyed to the U.S. government that the recent measures are extremely regrettable and have strongly requested that they be reconsidered.\" Japan is facing 24% tarrffs. The measures, he added, \"could have a significant impact on economic relations between Japan and the U.S., and ultimately on the global economy and the multilateral trading system as a whole.\" South Korea's acting President Han Duck-soo instructed the government to \"pour out all of its capabilities at its disposal to overcome this trade crisis,\" in a statement quoted by the Yonhap news agency. Han described Trump's measures -- which included 25% tariffs for all South Korean goods -- as \"very grave\" and warned of \"the approach of the reality of a global tariff war.\" Smaller nations also railed against Trump's measures. Fiji's Deputy Prime Minister Biman Prasad criticized the 32% tariffs to be imposed on the Pacific island nation as \"disproportionate\" and \"unfair.\" ABC News' Jack Moore, Leah Sarnoff, Will Gretsky and Joe Simonetti contributed to this report. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":1}

The Trump administration\u2019s tariffs are being applied on a country-by-country basis, and are calculated by combining the rate of tariffs, non-monetary barriers, \u201cand other forms of cheating.\u201d Trump said the U.S. will charge other countries \u201capproximately half\u201d of their charges. \u201cApril, 2, 2025 will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America\u2019s destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,\u201d Trump said on Wednesday, adding that his tariffs are the \u201cdeclaration of economic independence.\u201d Baseline 10% tariffs are expected to go into effect on Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET, while reciprocal levies are set to be effective on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET.

However, the analysts said that even if Apple is exempted from the reciprocal tariffs, \u201cit will need to accelerate its supply chain diversification efforts, and thus needs to pay its suppliers better and give more share to those who could help AAPL achieve this objective.\u201d Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Tariffs are about to make a bad situation even worse.  \ufeffCar prices are already at historic highs, while most shoppers are underwater on their loans. Tariffs are about to make a bad situation even worse.  by  Andrew J. Hawkins \u201cLiberation Day\u201d has arrived. Get ready to be liberated from affordable vehicle prices.  As promised, President Donald Trump\u2019s 25 percent tariffs for imported vehicles went into effect Thursday, sending the auto industry into full panic mode. Some analysts are predicting a $5,000 to $10,000 price hike on new cars out of the gate, while others are still struggling to wrap their heads around the logic of Trump\u2019s auto tariffs. It was a nuclear-level threat for the already unsettled auto industry, with little relief in sight.  Trump\u2019s argument is relatively straightforward, if nonsensical: Don\u2019t like the tariffs? Just buy an American-made car. The only problem is that there is no such thing. Even vehicles made in the US rely on a complex supply chain that runs across borders and through multiple nations. The average car contains roughly 30,000 individual parts. Even cars produced domestically obtain 40\u201350 percent of their parts from abroad, according to Dan Ives, the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, a financial services firm. \u201cThe tariffs are a debacle of epic proportions for the auto industry and US consumers as the concept of a US made car with all US parts is a fairy tale fictional narrative,\u201d Ives wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. \u201cThe more people we speak with from the auto industry around the world it is becoming crystal clear this tariff\/US policy will cause pure chaos to the global auto industry and will raise the prices of a typical car to a US consumer by $5k to $10k out of the gates.\u201d \u201cIt is becoming crystal clear this tariff\/US policy will cause pure chaos to the global auto industry\u201d Other firms were predicting an even higher price increase as the new tariffs started to go into effect. Anderson Economic Group concluded that the tariffs could boost manufacturing costs by $4,000 to more than $10,000 per car, depending on the vehicle model. Battery-electric crossover SUVs could see the biggest spike of $12,000. The effect could be even more pronounced at the lower end of the market, with many of the most affordable vehicles from GM, Ford, Kia, and Hyundai produced outside the US. Affordability is already a huge problem for car buyers, with average transactions for new cars clocking in at $48,118 in January, according to market researcher Edmunds. There are only 27 vehicles available under $30,000 \u2014 four of which have already been discontinued, including the Chevy Malibu and Nissan Versa. Many of these models are sourced from Mexico, Japan, and South Korea. Last year, these models made up 13 percent of all vehicles sold in the US.  Slapping tariffs on these vehicles as they arrive in the US would \u201cdrastically\u201d change the dynamics, pushing sticker prices up by an average of $5,300, according to Erin Keating, executive analyst at Cox Automotive.  \u201cThis is difficult news for an industry already staring down an affordability problem,\u201d Keating added in a statement.  For decades, car ownership has been a hallmark of the American dream. We built our communities around car ownership, squeezing out transit, and shrinking pedestrian spaces to make way for bigger and bigger vehicles. For most people in the US, owning a car isn\u2019t an option; it\u2019s a necessity to participate in daily life.  \u201cThis is difficult news for an industry already staring down an affordability problem.\u201d Consumers were already facing elevated costs when financing new vehicles before the tariffs hit. One in 5 new car buyers are taking on seven-year loans to finance a new car purchase, in a sign of increasing financial stress, Edmunds says. And an increasing number of people with car loans owe more than their vehicle is worth.  \u201cEven with rates holding relatively flat, the continued reliance on extended terms and high monthly payments reveals how challenging car buying remains,\u201d says Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at Edmunds. \u201cAnd now, with auto tariffs officially taking effect today, there\u2019s a risk that they will add fuel to the fire \u2014 triggering a disruption that could push vehicles even further out of reach for many shoppers.\u201d The Trump administration is considering other methods of relief for car buyers. The White House said it is calling for tax breaks to incentivize purchases of US-made vehicles and pursuing deregulation to lower industrywide costs. But the outcome is uncertain.  With prices expected to surge, many people who had been considering a car purchase are crowding into dealerships, trying to take advantage of pre-tariff prices. Consumer experts advise against panic shopping, but of course, most people aren\u2019t thinking rationally as they watch the news with growing anxiety.  \u201cIt never pays to rush out and make a rash decision that you might regret,\u201d says Jake Fisher, senior director of Consumer Reports\u2019 Auto Test Center. \u201cEven if the tariffs are here to stay, in a short time, the value of your trade-in will increase too.\u201d \u201cIt never pays to rush out and make a rash decision that you might regret.\u201d Some automakers are taking advantage of elevated inventories \u2014 the total number of new and used vehicles that dealers have for sale \u2014 to offer short-term incentives to panicked shoppers. Ford is offering employee discounts on most models, including the Mustang Mach-E and Maverick, both of which are built in Mexico, to all shoppers through June 2nd, Reuters reports. Ford had more than four months of inventory in February, above the industry average of nearly three months, according to Cox. Hyundai\u2019s response was to announce a $21 billion investment in the US to stave off the effect of the tariffs. And others are taking a more drastic approach. Stellantis said today it was temporarily laying off 900 workers at five of its US factories and pausing production at assembly plants in Canada and Mexico.  Even Tesla, which is run by billionaire best buddy Elon Musk, is exposed to these new tariffs. The company assembles its vehicles in the US, but 20\u201325 percent of its parts are sourced from Mexico, according to a list of car part origins published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.  The tariffs will likely lead to more automakers trying to negotiate deals or exemptions with the administration. And ultimately, this is probably what Trump wants: to be the most important person in the room, at the center of the chaos he helped create.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell modestly last week, remaining within the same range of recent years The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell modestly last week, remaining within the same range of recent years. Jobless claim filings fell by 6,000 to 219,000 for the week ending March 29, the Labor Department said Thursday. That\u2019s less than the 226,000 new applications analysts forecast. Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs, and have remained mostly in a range between 200,000 and 250,000 for the past few years. However, following the Trump administration\u2019s announcement of widespread tariff hikes yesterday, economists are worried about a global economic slowdown that could upend what has been an incredibly resilient labor market. Like his pledge to institute tariffs, Trump\u2019s promise to drastically downsize the federal government workforce is fully in motion. It\u2019s not clear when the job cuts ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency, or \u201cDOGE,\u201d will surface in the weekly layoffs data, but some economists have suggested they could show up in the Labor Department\u2019s March jobs report, which comes out Friday. The February jobs report showed that the federal government shed 10,000 jobs, the most since June of 2022. On Monday, some workers at the Food and Drug Administration were told to pack their laptops and prepare for the possibility that they wouldn\u2019t be back, according to an email obtained by The Associated Press.  The mass dismissals are expected to result in 20,000 fewer jobs \u2014 nearly a quarter of its staff \u2014 at the Department of Health and Human Services. About 10,000 jobs will be eliminated through layoffs, while another 10,000 workers took early retirement and voluntary separation offers. Other federal agencies that have either announced layoffs or are planning cuts include the IRS, Small Business Administration, Veterans Affairs and Department of Education. The layoffs are part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce through \u201cDOGE,\u201d spearheaded by billionaire Elon Musk. Despite showing some signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains healthy with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs. The government reported that U.S. employers added a solid 151,000 jobs in February, and while the unemployment rate inched up to 4.1%, it remains a healthy figure by historical standards. Analysts surveyed by data firm FactSet forecast that nonfarm payrolls in March will show an increase of 130,000 and that the unemployment rate will tick up to 4.2%. Some high-profile companies have announced job cuts already this year, including Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines and Facebook parent company Meta. The four-week average of applications, which aims to smooth out some of the week-to-week swings, fell by 1,250 to 223,000. The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of March 22 increased by 56,000 to 1.9 million. That's the most since November of 2021. 24\/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","label":0}

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  Software engineers Argenis De La Rosa and Ryan Prescott took a creative approach to their job search recently.          \"I'll pay someone $10k if they find me a 6 figure software developer role,\" De La Rosa first posted on LinkedIn.               \"I'll draft out a legitimate contract which you and I will sign, and I'll make bi-weekly payments or whatever the payment structure of the job role is, when I get paid, you get paid,\" he added. \"It's that simple. No hidden BS.\"               He added in his post that it's \"a nice bounty especially if you already know a company that is hiring or are a recruiter, or are a developer who wants to give a referral.\"               Prescott and other job seekers on LinkedIn later joined in and posted the offer themselves.               It's an unusual proposition. While recruiters often get commissions for bringing on new hires, and companies frequently give referral bonuses to employees who recommend an external candidate who gets hired, it's usually not the applicants themselves who shell out for a position filled.               De La Rosa told Business Insider he had the idea one morning as a \"Hail Mary.\"               \"I was kind of being a little bit sarcastic, but I guess everyone received it somewhat well, and I just kind of went with it,\" he said.               The first 24 hours after he posted were \"nonstop\" messages, he said. De La Rosa said he received everything ranging from \"very sketchy\" sales pitches to senior engineers from Big Tech companies offering referrals or mentorship.               The software engineer said he lined up three job interviews in quick succession after making his post.               \"I've gotten so much career advice like polish your rsum, make a portfolio, try to send these messages to people you don't know \u2014 and that doesn't work,\" De La Rosa said. \"This has gotten more attention, ironically enough, than trying to do what they recommend.\"               Prescott, who saw De La Rosa's post on LinkedIn before posting his own version of it, told BI he was initially skeptical about the idea but ultimately thought that \"this could be a really good way to cut through the noise and have my voice heard.\"               Some people, of course, were trying to cash in on the deal. (Prescott says one guy half-jokingly told him, \"I take cash or card.\") But what struck him most from the messages he received was the number of people who offered to help but didn't want the money.               \"It was really interesting and super heartwarming to see the altruism,\" he said.               Many tech companies overhired during the pandemic and later conducted mass layoffs, flooding the tech job market with thousands of applicants jostling for the same jobs.               Before the pandemic hit, \"you could get tech interviews left and right,\" De La Rosa said. Now, he has to do \"so much more\" and gets \"such a low ROI\" on his job search practices.               De La Rosa said his offer is \"a new way to approach this market that's just changing in front of our eyes.\"               \"The market is not at all what it used to be, and you really have to differentiate yourself a little bit more,\" Prescott said. \"It basically seems like everything you thought you knew about job hunting a year ago or two years ago, do the opposite.\"               Employers, it seems, are \"looking for unicorns,\" he said.               \"It's not so much, can you do the job? It's can you tick every single bullet point on my job description and there's no room for error,\" he added.               Prescott says a proposition like his and De La Rosa's \"puts more power in the hands of the candidate.\"               \"They have the choice to decide, what is it worth to me to land this role?\" he said. \"The candidate can decide what it's worth and work those terms out themselves.\"               To De La Rosa, the math was simple: \"If I give up maybe six weeks of work in exchange for an opportunity at a reputable company, I would trade that every day of the week,\" he said.               Prescott ultimately landed a job after a startup CEO reached out to him and he subsequently went through several rounds of interviews. Suffice it to say, he's not paying his current boss $10,000 to work for him, so the offer in his LinkedIn post was moot anyway.               But it had the desired effect: helping him stand out.               \"Anything that's driving traffic to your LinkedIn profile is going to be beneficial in a market where cold applications and more traditional methods of job hunting are just falling flat because of the volume of applicants,\" Prescott said.               The biggest takeaway they've had from this experience?               \"I would really just encourage more people to differentiate themselves in strange and remarkable ways,\" said Prescott. \"I think it takes a degree of confidence and a willingness and ability to take risk to succeed in the market that we're in.\"               While De La Rosa is still looking for a full-time staff position, he's gotten contract work in the meantime.               He says he stands by \"just posting publicly, even if it seems at the moment vulnerable.\"               \"I think people resonate with that,\" he said. \"If you're posting where you're at in your journey, I think a lot of people would generally want to help.               \"The interviews I've gotten in the last week alone were more than the last four months.\"       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

As of 2 p.m. Eastern Tuesday, the stock was down more than 39 percent, after being off as much as 44 percent in mid-morning trading. Gary Friedman, chief executive of Restoration Hardware, was unusually frank in the company\u2019s quarterly earnings call on Thursday. The transcript reveals the moment he saw its decimated stock price: \u201cI guess the stock was down based on some of the numbers we reported and then it got killed because of \u2014 really, [Oh sh\u2014t], OK. I just looked at the screen.

Still, the company\u2019s earnings report didn\u2019t help. Restoration Hardware reported adjusted earnings of $1.58 a share, while analysts polled by FactSet (FDS) had predicted adjusted earnings of $1.92 a share Despite the bloodbath in the stock market and blaming tariffs, Friedman praised the Trump administration. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got a very smart administration negotiating at a level we haven\u2019t seen any administration, at least in our lifetimes, negotiate. I think it\u2019s not a time \u2014 like I say to our team, it\u2019s a don\u2019t move until you see it. Take your time. This is a chess game, not a checker chain,\u201d Friedman said. He said the company is well stocked with in-the-warehouse furniture to withstand some uncertainty in the supply chain. \u201cI\u2019m really happy about the inventory position we\u2019re in because I think we can really cut back on receipts until we have clarity,\u201d Friedman said.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"The tariffs apply to imported cars, SUVs, minivans, cargo vans and light trucks Steep tariffs of 25% on vehicles imported into the United States went into effect early Thursday morning, as international leaders reacted to and markets reeled from President Donald Trump's announcement hours earlier of even more sweeping tariffs set to begin later this week and next week. The auto tariffs, which apply to imported cars, SUVs, minivans, cargo vans and light trucks, could raise car prices by thousands of dollars, according to experts. Overall, half of the approximately 16 million vehicles purchased in the U.S. last year were imported, according to the White House. The White House touted the tariffs as a means of safeguarding U.S. national security and economic strength, saying the U.S. auto industry had been undermined by excessive imports. Experts say U.S. shoppers will almost certainly see higher prices for foreign cars, as the increased tariffs are passed on to consumers. That sticker shock could also send prices higher for used vehicles. Tariffs of 25% on key imported auto parts, including engines and electrical components, were set to go into effect later. The auto tariffs went into effect just hours after Trump unveiled a long-promised wide-ranging tariff plan that included a baseline tax on imports from all trading partners as well as steeper ones on countries that impose levies on U.S. goods. \"My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day,\" Trump said from the White House Rose Garden, claiming his latest action would free the U.S. from dependence on foreign goods. Under the plan, goods imported from China will be hit with what Trump called \"kind reciprocal\" tariffs of 34%; goods imported from the European Union will be hit with 20% tariffs. Overall, the tariffs announced by Trump \"approach levels not seen since the 'Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930,'\" two experts at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said in an statement, referring to the measure signed into by President Herbert Hoover, which historians say exacerbated the nation's economic downturn during the Great Depression. Last month, Trump also slapped a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports as well as certain goods from China, Canada and Mexico. Trump made his announcement Wednesday after the stock market had closed for the day, but stock futures plunged on the news. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 1,100 points or 2.7%. S&P 500 futures lost 3.9% and Nasdaq-100 futures tumbled 4.7%. International leaders decried Trump's announcement. \"China urges the United States to immediately cancel its unilateral tariff measures and properly resolve differences with its trading partners through equal dialogue,\" a Chinese Ministry of Commerce spokesperson said in a statement, arguing that the tariffs will \"endanger global economic development and the stability of the supply chain.\" Trump's announcement Wednesday slapping 34% tariffs on China comes on top of 20% tariffs he previously announced -- bringing the total tax levied against one of the U.S.'s biggest trading partners to 54%. The European Union said it has a \"strong plan to retaliate,\" which European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is set to deliver on Thursday. In a Facebook post, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni called the tariffs targeted toward the European Union \"wrong.\" She added, \"We will do everything we can to work towards an agreement with the United States, with the aim of avoiding a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global players.\" The trade maneuvers have strained relations with Canada and Mexico, two key allies and neighbors. Neither country is included in the list of countries set to be hit with reciprocal tariffs. Mexico said it will give its response later this week.

Eastern, Apple was down 9.28% since yesterday.\r  During his tariff announcement, Trump referred to Apple and spoke of how his efforts meant the company was now investing $500 billion in the US. \"They never spent money like that here,\" he said.\r He presented this as evidence that his tariffs will result in manufacturing returning to the US. But the market recognizes that this will not happen \u2014  and that Apple's $500 billion announcement was political re-framing of work it was already doing.\r Apple has so far spent years, and its suppliers have spent billions, trying to move away from relying on China. Still that country dominates, and it's unlikely Apple will ever be able to stop using it.\r The reason is not economic, however, it's to do with the skills required to make Apple devices. Tim Cook has previously acknowledged that China used to be seen as a cheap source of manufacturing, \"but it hasn't been for a long time.\"\r As far back as 2012, Cook was saying publicly that he wanted Apple to make more in the US, but it wasn't possible.\r \"But look, how many tool-and-die makers do you know in America?\" he said. \"I could ask them, nationwide, to come here tonight and we couldn't fill [a few hundred seats in] this room.\"  William Gallagher has 30 years of experience between the BBC and AppleInsider discussing Apple technology.

In the face of crippling tariffs, Apple will have to raise prices of popular items like the iPhone in the US and elsewhere \u2014 but is trying to delay increases until the next set of hardware upgrades.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Fundamentally wrong, was how Germany's outgoing chancellor, Olaf Scholz, described the new Trump tariffs. A unilateral attack - that was the view of Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez. French President Emmanuel Macron called them brutal, unfounded and certain to have a \"massive impact\" on the European economy. He convened an emergency meeting with representatives of French businesses most affected by the newly announced 20% tariffs on EU goods sold to the US and issued a call to arms to European business \"not to invest in America for some time until we have clarified things\". \"What message would we send by having major European players investing billions of euros in the American economy at a time when [the US] is hitting us?\" he said. For France it's wine, champagne and the aeronautical industry, for Germany it's cars, and for Italy it's luxury goods. It's well known these sectors sell well abroad and now risk being clobbered by US import taxes.  Overall, the chemicals, machinery and equipment industries in the EU are seen as the most vulnerable to the tariffs. But dig a little deeper and there are other EU sectors, reliant on the US market, that could come as a bit of a surprise.  French cognac, generally dismissed as an old person's tipple in Europe, is the booze of choice for many American rappers, playing a prominent role in the music and lifestyle of stars like Jay-Z, 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg. More than 40% of French brandy is exported to the US. Spain exports a lot of gas turbines to the US, alongside tonnes of olive oil. When we look at which EU countries are most exposed to the US in terms of GDP, the picture is also not quite what you might imagine. Ireland is highly dependent on the US in terms of goods and services. Those exports - a lot linked to the pharmaceutical industry (which is currently exempt from the 20% tariffs, until the US boosts its own production) and also tech - make up a fifth of Ireland's GDP. Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta are more exposed than the EU average in terms of services exports.  Belgium, the Netherlands and Slovakia are in a similar position when it comes to goods.  Germany has a greater exposure to the US than the other major EU economies, at over 5% of GDP, followed by Italy (about 4%), France (3%) and Spain (just over 2%). These figures were collated in 2024 by CaixaBank research based on Eurostat figures for the previous year. The response to the new US tariffs is being coordinated at EU HQ in Brussels. The European Commission deals with all overarching trade matters for the bloc's members.  Commission President Ursula von der Leyen claims they hold \"a lot of cards\", including the strength to negotiate and the power to push back. The US economy is mighty. It makes up 25% of global GDP.  But the EU single market of 450 million people (the biggest single market in the world) stands very close in size at 22% of global GDP.  So, yes, the EU can bite - hard - as well as bark when it comes to retaliating against Donald Trump's tariffs. Especially if, as EU figures have suggested, the bloc targets US services like Big Tech, possibly including Apple, Meta, Amazon and even Elon Musk's platform X. But that risks a new backlash by the Trump administration. And the EU wants to avoid upping the ante. If you take politics into account, not just economics, the EU has less room for manoeuvre than you might think.  Take energy supplies, the EU has been buying US liquified natural gas (LNG) after it weaned itself off Russian gas following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.  Tricky to reduce or heavily tax those imports. That would badly impact EU consumers, not only US industry, and it would worsen already dismal relations with the US.  Think of all the recent rows over defence spending and Ukraine. Aside from the economic hell the EU sees and hopes to avoid in the new Trump tariffs, the bloc also really wants to sidestep a trade war with the country that used to be Europe's best friend. So, the Brussels plan is: threaten heavy retaliation, hope Donald Trump is persuaded to negotiate, then pray he'll stage a U-turn on tariffs.  The EU's trade commissioner, Maros Sefcovic, says he's speaking to his US counterparts on Friday. It's an opening gambit. The EU is in no rush to retaliate. The Trump administration has ruled out any country negotiating its way out of the new tariffs before they become live this weekend. But after that, what could the EU offer the US president to persuade him to back down? Trump is incandescent about the EU's massive trade surplus. It sells far more goods than it buys from the US. The surplus for 2024 was around $200bn (\u20ac180bn; $153bn). It's the other way round when it comes to services - the US sells far more to the EU than the other way round. That is why the EU thinks its main retaliatory leverage against the US would lie in services, like banks and big tech. To redress the goods imbalance, the EU could offer to buy more LNG from the US, or more military equipment, following its pledge to Washington to do more for its own security. But that would break a different EU promise - to boost withering European arms industries by trying to buy EU when re-arming EU countries. It is something the US has already objected to, so that's tricky. Brussels could also cut direct and indirect tariffs on US goods. It could lose quotas on US agricultural produce. It would be hugely reluctant to comply with another US ask: to water down its much-trumpeted digital regulations, aimed at limiting monopolies and placing restrictions on speech and content in the EU. How do you price in the possible collapse of the international trading system, EU officials ask. European firms fret about their markets being flooded by cheap goods from non-EU countries that are also hit by Trump tariffs and seeking to sell elsewhere.  The risk is very real when it comes to China. Trump is slapping more that 50% tariffs on Beijing when you add it all up. Would the EU have to ratchet up its import duties on Chinese goods to protect itself and could that lead to an unintended trade war with China? These are anxious and hugely uncertain economic times. Which is why the European Commission says it also wants to focus on matters it can control - if EU capitals agree - and that is reducing internal barriers within the EU single market.  Those barriers, such as tax regimes, vary from country to country and impact the EU's overall economic growth and competitiveness.  The IMF calculates they're equivalent to a 45% tariff on EU manufacturing; 110% when it comes to services. That is far higher than the tariffs now imposed on the EU by Donald Trump.  EU countries say they're united in combating those. So far they've been divided over completing their own internal market. US President Donald Trump has imposed a 10% tariff on UK goods, but a 20% tariff on EU goods. The EU's message is that it is ready to negotiate with the US but at the same time poised to hit back too. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen says US tariffs will see \"uncertainty spiral\" as world leaders react to Trump's announcement. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen has vowed a united response to US tariffs, warning of further countermeasures if negotiations fail. As top US officials describe Europe as \"freeloaders\", European leaders and policy-makers are said to be \"sick to the stomach\". Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement      When you buy produce by weight, some fruits and veggies offer more bang for your grocery buck. Here are the types of produces that end up mostly in your mouth and not in the compost bin.    The price you pay for fruits and vegetables at the grocery store doesn't tell the whole story.\u00a0 When you're paying for an item by weight, in culinary math terms the yield, or \"edible portion\" of a given item factors into its actual cost, which is necessary for chefs to consider when accounting for how to price a dish. In short, some types of produce are a better deal, ounce for ounce, than others.\u00a0 Does that mean you should be calculating every element that goes into your home-cooked meals? Probably not. (Or rather, hopefully not? Given the state of the economy and the price of eggs, some of us might have to.) But culinary math can help determine what you're actually spending in the produce aisle versus what you're potentially wasting. Whether you're about saving pennies or saving the environment by considering food waste\u00a0(or you'd like to do both), there are food items that have a lower value considering how much of them you can consume. Fruits and vegetables offer starkly different overall value when edible yield is considered.\u00a0 Fear not, this isn't an exercise that involves actually measuring the weight of banana peels or trying to assign a percentage to how much of the ends of zucchini you throw out. Even chefs make use of handy yield charts that inform, on average, how much of a given item is usable. Determining the actual cost of an ingredient, then, involves calculating the new price based on the edible portion. For instance, if a head of cauliflower costs $1.49 per pound, and only 55% of it is usable -- once you remove the core and leaves -- then the per pound cost increases by almost double for the usable portion. You may have spent about $3 on two pounds of cauliflower, but you're getting to use only a little over a pound of what you paid for. To determine the actual cost, then, you take the purchase cost and divide by the yield percentage, expressed as a decimal.\u00a0 For example: $1.49\/.55 = $2.70\u00a0 A head of cauliflower has a considerably low edible yield. Suddenly, that head of cauliflower doesn't seem like so much of a bargain. Consider, also, that chefs might routinely make use of more of various fruits and vegetables than do home cooks. Broccoli stems can be peeled, cooked and pulverized into a cream of broccoli soup, and onions can go, skin and all, into a pot of stock. Lemons and limes typically get zested before they get juiced, and even pineapple skin has culinary applications. Pineapple fronds may even end up as garnish in the cocktail menu. Watermelon rinds can be pickled. Are you pickling your watermelon rinds at home? Didn't think so. Next time you load up on bell peppers at the market, consider that you'll only be consuming about 65% of the total product. You don't need to be purchasing in bulk by weight to consider how much of an ingredient you're actually going to be able to use. Understanding the yield of certain items can help you look at the price tag a little differently, as well as consider how much is headed for the trash.\u00a0 Here are 12 common items in the grocery store that have the lowest percentages of edible portion, and therefore the highest waste. (Garden peas have the smallest usable portion, at 38%, but lucky for all of us, if you're actually shelling peas at home, you probably grew them yourself.) Using current prices I collected from Instacart. Cauliflower $2.99 each 55% $5.43 each Asparagus $2.99\/lb. 56% $5.34\/lb. Broccoli $2.99\/bunch 61% $4.90\/bunch Fennel bulb $2.69 each 60% $4.48 each Green leaf lettuce $1.99\/head 67% $2.97\/head Bell peppers $1.50 each 65% $2.31 each Butternut squash $3.37 each 66% $5.10 each Banana 45 cents each 67% 67 cents each Cantaloupe $4.99 each 50% $9.98 each Pineapple $5.99 each 52% $11.52 each Watermelon $6.99 each 47% $14.87 each Grapefruit $2.29 each 47% $4.87 each According to the US\u00a0Environmental Protection Agency (while it still exists), food waste accounts for 60% of greenhouse gas emissions. Even if you're a consummate recycler who always brings your own grocery bags to the store, if you don't have a way to deal with food waste (a local food waste recycling program, a backyard compost pile, or a countertop food recycling appliance), the produce you buy most often may be contributing to the problem more than how it's packaged. Berries may seem expensive at first glance, but they're one of of the highest yield types of produce you'll find at the market.\u00a0 Read more:\u00a0I Cut My Kitchen Waste by 80% in One Week With This Small Appliance Maybe the above chart helps you think creatively about how to use more of what you buy, or at least helps you adjust your shopping habits, if you're someone who frequently throws out stuff that's gone bad. Perhaps it puts in perspective the extreme cost of buying certain items out of season, especially items that have a low yield. (Looking at you, watermelon.) Spinach is cheap, good for you and results in very little food waste after preparing. Fortunately, however, there are many items in the produce aisle that have high percentages of usable portions.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"In the topsy-turvy world of the Trump administration, market panic and financial suffering are somehow good things. The president unveiled his economic agenda on Wednesday, revealing steep tariff hikes on practically every country in the world\u2014regardless of whether the U.S. is running a trade deficit or surplus there. The news sent markets reeling. But by Thursday morning, Donald Trump was still celebrating his plan. \u201cTHE OPERATION IS OVER! THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social. \u201cTHE PROGNOSIS IS THAT THE PATIENT WILL BE FAR STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER, AND MORE RESILIENT THAN EVER BEFORE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\u201d But it\u2019s unclear what metrics\u2014if any\u2014Trump used to measure his success. In reality, American businesses were seriously disturbed. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged by 1,500 points, about 3.5 percent, while the S&P 500 sank by 3.9 percent, setting both on pace for their worst day since the 2022 inflation crisis. The Nasdaq Composite tanked by more than 5 percent\u2014bringing it down by 17 percent from its all-time high and down 13 percent year-to-date, the index\u2019s worst performance since March 2020. Stock futures similarly plummeted. The value of the U.S. dollar dropped, and the price for a troy ounce of gold skyrocketed. Overnight, some of the country\u2019s most competitive companies lost hundreds of billions of dollars. Nike and Lululemon, whose business models rely on international manufacturing deals in China and Vietnam, each lost more than 10 percent. Big-box stores also saw prominent losses: Best Buy, Target, and Home Depot lost 5 percent. The tech industry was similarly shaken: Apple was down 9 percent (worth approximately $300 billion in market value), Alphabet by 4 percent, Amazon by 7 percent, Meta by 7 percent, Microsoft by 3 percent, and Nvidia by 6 percent. Stores that rely heavily on imported goods saw their stocks tank too. Five Below lost 29 percent, Dollar Tree fell by 8 percent, and the Gap suffered a 22 percent loss. \u201cThe macro does not make sense, but the level of chaos and uncertainty, coupled with revaluing highly overpriced stocks, is hitting hard,\u201d assessed CNBC analyst Ron Insana on Thursday. In a note to investors, JP Morgan said that Trump\u2019s tariffs had a 40 percent chance of slingshotting the U.S. economy into a recession. JP Morgan underscored that the tariffs would cause a price surge\u2014adding 2 percent to the consumer price index\u2014and additionally raise taxes on Americans by $660 billion a year, \u201cthe largest tax increase in recent memory by a long shot,\u201d reported CNN. \u201cThe impact on inflation will be substantial,\u201d the analysts said, according to CNN. \u201cWe view the full implementation of these policies as a substantial macroeconomic shock.\u201d A judge has ordered the Trump administration to release a man whom it wrongly detained and planned to deport to El Salvador.  In a brief one-page filing overnight Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Rolando Olvera ordered that the government not only release Adrian Gil Rojas but that it buy him a ticket from Brownsville, Texas, back to New York.  \u201cThe Court holds that the Petitioner is a Venezuelan national with a valid Temporary Protected Status and was wrongfully detained,\u201d Olvera wrote.  \u201cThe Court further holds that Respondents produced no evidence that Petitioner is a danger to the public,\u201d he added.  The government had argued that it should be allowed to detain and deport Gil Rojas because his TPS was set to expire on April 2, but his lawyer insisted that he was in the process of reopening his immigration case and that there was reason to believe that the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to repeal TPS would fail.  The lawyer was right: On Monday, a San Francisco judge blocked the government from revoking the protected status of about 350,000 Venezuelans. Judge Edward Chen slammed Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem for making \u201csweeping negative generalizations about Venezuelan TPS beneficiaries.\u201d \u201cActing on the basis of a negative group stereotype and generalizing such stereotype to the entire group is the classic example of racism,\u201d Chen said in his order. Gil Rojas, who said that he was arrested in New York last month, had been one of dozens of Venezuelan nationals detained by ICE who were sneakily moved closer and closer to an airfield in Harlingen, Texas, where the government staged a mass deportation to a notorious torture prison in El Salvador.  On March 14, the plane that was supposed to take Gil Rojas suffered a mechanical issue and was rescheduled for the following day, giving his lawyer enough time to get Olvera to issue an order blocking his immediate removal. Gil Rojas was spared, unlike the dozens of others for whom due process was suspended under Donald Trump\u2019s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law he has reappropriated to aid in his mass deportation efforts.  Olvera said that when Gil Rojas was returned to New York, he should be released on his own recognizance, and recommended that he wear an ankle monitor while his immigration case was pending.  Earlier this week, the Trump administration admitted that it had wrongly deported Kilmer Armado Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national who had been granted protected status from being sent back to El Salvador. The government blamed an \u201cadministrative error,\u201d and a judge ruled that the man could not be returned to the U.S. because the court lacked jurisdiction now that he was out of U.S. custody.  Evidence that the government expedited the deportation of individuals who, as Olvera put it, were not a \u201cdanger to the public\u201d only continues to mount. The government revealed that it had heavily relied on the tattoos to identify members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang the U.S. government has deemed a terrorist group, for deportation. But experts on the gang say that there are no tattoos that signify TdA affiliation.  When Democrats attacked the Trump administration for the gargantuan price of eggs, the administration responded by importing vast quantities from Turkey and South Korea\u2014two countries that were hit hard by the tariffs imposed on Wednesday.\u00a0 When asked about the issue, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins had no definitive answer on whether those imported eggs would be tariffed, reinforcing the multiple contradictions at the center of Trump\u2019s isolationist trade war in the process.\u00a0 \u201cPresident Trump yesterday gave you much praise talking about the job you\u2019ve done in the last month and a half. I wanna talk about what you\u2019ve done with eggs,\u201d Fox Business\u2019s Maria Bartiromo asked Rollins on Thursday. \u201cNational egg prices have declined 9 percent from last week, now averaging $3 a dozen, according to the USDA. Secretary \u2026 are eggs gonna be tariffed?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cWell, so, yeah let\u2019s pivot to eggs.\u2026 Listen, we rolled out a very bold plan about a month ago.\u2026 Obviously it\u2019s his vision we\u2019re effectuating. The market reacted very favorably to it, [it] included some short-term imports but also included helping our poultry farmers in America,\u201d Rollins answered, avoiding the question. \u201cSo as we repopulate our chicken farms and our egg-laying farms, I think we\u2019ll see the price coming down even more.\u2026 Only good news on the egg front, and hopefully it will hold.\u201d \"Yes, I mean, all to be determined, we're all in negotiations, but yes, that's a possibility\" -- Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins can't definitively answer a question about whether imported eggs are being tariffed pic.twitter.com\/DeQf55p14J \u201cSo where are the eggs coming from that you\u2019re importing?\u201d Bartiromo asked.\u00a0 \u201cWell, we\u2019re importing from Turkey, we\u2019re importing from South Korea, to a few other countries right now,\u201d Rollins responded. \u201cBut again, at the end of the day. once our farms are repopulated \u2026 then we\u2019ll go back to pretty much using all American-lain eggs.\u201d \u201cSo then that means that eggs will be tariffed, if you\u2019re taking them from Turkey, right? That\u2019s part of the tariff plan,\u201d Bartiromo pushed. There will be a 10 percent tariff on Turkey, according to Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, yes, all to be determined,\u201d Rollins replied, refusing to commit. \u2018We\u2019re all at negotiations, but yes, that\u2019s a possibility.\u201d\u00a0 Lower grocery prices\u2014and lower prices in general\u2014were a central theme of Trump\u2019s campaign. Trump himself riffed on it at his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d announcement. But the new tariffs go directly against those promises, and even his inner circle are struggling to find a way to explain themselves. Got a problem with the Trump administration? Good luck. Recently laid-off employees from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were told to contact Anita Pinder, the former director at the agency\u2019s Office of Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights, with any complaints. A notice informed severed workers that they had 45 calendar days to contact Pinder following their termination date, listing Pinder\u2019s name, email, and phone number. But those who knew Pinder said the directive came as a \u201cgut punch,\u201d according to The Washington Post, since Pinder died last year. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t have run it past the people at CMS that were at the funeral and knew she died,\u201d Karen Shields, one of Pinder\u2019s former co-workers, told the Post. \u201cThis is a lack of communication. There is just a better way to do this.\u201d Shields told the newspaper that it \u201cpained\u201d her to see Pinder\u2019s name used in the reduction-in-force notices. \u201cShe would have been someone, even though her job would have been on the chopping block, she would have helped,\u201d Shields said. The negligent error is just one recent instance in which the \u201cshock and awe\u201d of the Trump administration\u2019s federal makeover has resulted in dud details and mass confusion. At the Food and Drug Administration, fired staffers were instructed to contact an Office of Equal Employment Opportunity employee that had left the agency more than a month ago, the Post reported. So far, the Trump administration\u2014directed by Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency\u2014has fired more than 100,000 federal employees. But tens of thousands more government jobs are expected to be on the chopping block as Trump pursues a second round of \u201cvoluntary\u201d buyouts. More than 10,000 jobs are expected to be cut at the Department of Health and Human Services, which encompasses the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed downsizing the agency\u2019s 82,000-person workforce by nearly a quarter. A new Gallup poll shows that Americans are much more worried about Social Security and the economy.  The poll, which measured opinions from March 3 to March 16, said that concern about the Social Security system is at a 15-year high, with 52 percent of Americans worried about it a \u201cgreat deal.\u201d Also ranking high were the economy at 60 percent, health care costs at 59 percent, and inflation at 56 percent.  The worries reflect the Trump administration\u2019s actions over the past few months, with cuts made to the Social Security Administration and the whiplash over the president\u2019s bizarre tariff decisions. Those fears may get worse, as Trump went ahead with instituting aggressive tariffs against countries across the world on Wednesday, calling it \u201cLiberation Day.\u201d Meanwhile, Elon Musk, who is overseeing much of the administration\u2019s policy, has called Social Security \u201cthe biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\u201d  Markets have already plummeted Thursday, and criticism of the tariffs have even come within the Republican Party. Cuts to the Social Security Administration threaten to cause interruptions to benefits for 73 million retired workers, their survivors, and poor and disabled Americans. Last month, Martin O\u2019Malley, who headed the SSA under President Biden, warned that the cuts could result in the agency missing payments for the first time in its 80-year history.  It\u2019s no surprise that the last time worries about Social Security were this high, the country was in the midst of a recession brought about by the financial crisis of 2008. The difference between now and then is that these worries are brought about by self-inflicted crises. Neither the SSA or the economy were in trouble prior to Trump\u2019s inauguration. If the president continues on its current course, these worries could evolve into full-blown panic over losing Social Security and an even worse recession.  The Trump administration is urging nervous voters to \u201ctrust\u201d it in response to the impending economic fallout from the President\u2019s tariffs on virtually all foreign imports. \u201cTo anyone on Wall Street this morning I would say trust in President Trump,\u201d press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on CNN Thursday morning. \u201cThis is a president who is doubling down on his proven economic formula from his first time. We saw a wages increase, we saw inflation come down. We had a Trump energy boom, we had the largest tax cuts in history, and that\u2019s exactly what the president intends to do.\u2026 The United States of America is no longer going to be cheated by foreign nations around the world.\u201d The trade war that the president announced on Wednesday as \u201cLiberation Day\u201d has already tanked the stock market. The country is lurching into a recession, and there is little indication that things will improve anytime soon. Indeed, the tariffs announced on Wednesday are little more than a spiteful policy intended to stick it to friend and foe alike, ostensibly for the purpose of reinvigorating American manufacturing. This is virtually impossible, as these aggressive reciprocal tariffs will most certainly drive up prices for manufacturers and consumers across the country. But the administration would rather have you believe that the economic impact won\u2019t be that bad, or even noticeable.  \u201cWhat can you tell the American people that\u2014they just can\u2019t afford an extra $3 here and there\u2014about the government making up the difference from them?\u201d Lawrence Jones asked Vice President JD Vance on Thursday morning. \u201cWill costs go up at some point, will this just be temporary? Are we talkin\u2019 three months or six months?\u201d \u201cWe know a lot of Americans are worried. So we are working very hard to bring prices down,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWhat I ask folks to appreciate here is that we are not gonna fix things overnight.\u2026 We know people are struggling, we\u2019re fighting as quickly as we can to fix what was left to us. But it\u2019s not gonna happen immediately. But we really do believe that if we pursue the right deregulation, we pursue those energy cost-reducing policies, yes people are gonna see it in their pocketbook, they\u2019re also gonna benefit from the fact that foreign countries can\u2019t take advantage of us anymore, that means their jobs are gonna be more secure.\u201d  Neither Vance nor Leavitt actually explain how actions like hitting China with a 34 percent tariff will bring prices down for the everyday American, or how this country will be a self-sufficient producer in just a few years. This backtracking and gaslighting is a far cry from Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cimmediately bring prices down, starting on day one.\u201d In the scores of countries hit by Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs announced Wednesday, one was mysteriously\u2014but not surprisingly\u2014absent: Russia.  White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Axios Wednesday that Moscow had been spared from Trump\u2019s tariffs because U.S. sanctions already \u201cpreclude any meaningful trade.\u201d  Similarly, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News that it wasn\u2019t necessary to place tariffs on Russia because after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, trade between the U.S. and Russia had effectively dried up.  But the claim that the U.S. doesn\u2019t trade with Russia isn\u2019t remotely true. In 2024, the U.S. imported $3 billion worth of goods from Russia, which was down from $4.6 billion the year before.  While this number may be small in comparison to key trading partners such as Canada, which imported a whopping $412.7 billion worth of American goods in 2024, it is still significantly more trade than with other countries that Trump levied steep tariffs against.  For example, Saint Pierre et Miquelon, a small French island territory off the coast of Canada, was hit with a whopping 50 percent tariff on imports to the U.S. The island, which has a population of roughly 5,000 people, imported only $100,000 worth of U.S. goods in 2024 and exported roughly $3.4 million worth of goods back.  If that\u2019s not low enough, Trump even listed several uninhabited islands as receiving a 10 percent tariff on imports to the United States: Heard Island and the McDonald Islands, an Australian territory that is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site for its \u201ccomplete absence of alien plants and animals, as well as human impact.\u201d Clearly, a lack of trade was not an actual consideration in the Trump administration\u2019s decision to levy tariffs, though Leavitt claimed that existing sanctions were also why Cuba, Belarus, and North Korea were not included on the list.  With Leavitt\u2019s excuse falling flat, it seems increasingly likely that Trump has attempted to carve out a back door for Russian President Vladimir Putin to continue to do business with the U.S. as it makes an economic enemy out of every other country in the world.  Canada and Mexico were also absent from the list because Trump had already hit them with 25 percent tariffs on all U.S. imports, according to Leavitt.  The Trump administration seems to have destroyed global economies overnight while misunderstanding basic economics. In the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s tariff announcement Wednesday, former New Yorker financial writer James Surowiecki pointed out that a column on Trump\u2019s tariff sheet labeled \u201ctariffs charged to the U.S.A.\u201d was likely founded on bad math. \u201cThey didn\u2019t actually calculate tariff rates + non-tariff barriers, as they say they did. Instead, for every country, they just took our trade deficit with that country and divided it by the country\u2019s exports to us,\u201d Surowiecki argued. \u201cSo we have a $17.9 billion trade deficit with Indonesia. Its exports to us are $28 billion. $17.9\/$28 = 64 percent, which Trump claims is the tariff rate Indonesia charges us.\u201d \u201cWhat extraordinary nonsense this is,\u201d he added. That would mean that the Trump administration imposed earth-shattering tariff hikes on the rest of the world without looking at the whole picture. Mainly, that the administration calculated the tariffs charged by other countries by only looking at goods provided, rather than the combined value of goods and services\u2014something that \u201cmost economists seem to think is an odd way to calculate tariffs,\u201d according to BBC Verify\u2019s Shayan Sardarizadeh. The White House initially refuted the tariff theory. White House Deputy Press Secretary Kush Desai posted on X that \u201cwe literally calculated tariff and non tariff barriers.\u201d But in an attempt to prove his point, Desai grabbed a formula from the US Treasury website that actually proved Surowiecki\u2019s. Sardarizadeh broke it down. \u201c\u2206\u03c4\u1d62 = (x-m) \/ (\u03b5 x \u03c6 x m),\u201d he shared. \u201cThe formula includes \u2018x\u2019 for exports and \u2018m\u2019 for imports.\u201d \u201cBut it also has \u2018\u03b5\u2019 for \u2018price elasticity of import demand\u2019, set at 4 by the Treasury; multiplied by \u2018\u03c6\u2019 for \u2018elasticity of import prices\u2019, set at 0.25 by the Treasury, which means they basically cancel out each other as 4 x 0.25 = 1,\u201d Sardarizadeh continued. \u201cSo, in effect, all you\u2019re left with in the formula is exports - imports \/ imports, which is what X users and journalists had accurately pointed out all along.\u201d But the administration\u2019s bad math only matters so much to the tariff-heavy agenda. Even in countries where the trade deficit was less than 10 percent, or even in countries where there was a surplus, Trump still tacked on a 10 percent tariff. Donald Trump announced a range of tariffs on nearly every country in the world\u2014including, inexplicably, some practically uninhabited islands, one of which is home to a U.S. military base.  The British Indian Ocean Territory, a small cluster of islands in the South Indian Ocean, was hit with 10 percent tariffs on U.S. imports from the Trump administration Wednesday as part of its Liberation Day announcement.  The islands are mostly uninhabited, save for approximately 3,000 U.S. and U.K. military personnel who are stationed at a joint Navy Support Facility on the island Diego Garcia. Trump\u2019s tariffs would mostly affect the service members there. Another roughly 1,200 people live on the country\u2019s Chagos Archipelago. As one might expect from the name, the territory is owned by the United Kingdom, which Trump hit with a 10 percent tariff, relatively low compared to other countries. Trump also announced 10 percent tariffs on the Heard Island and McDonald Islands, an uninhabited Australian territory that was listed as a Unesco World Heritage site for its \u201ccomplete absence of alien plants and animals, as well as human impact.\u201d Australia was saddled with a 10 percent tariff, as well.  It\u2019s unclear whether the tariffs on these territories would compound to 20 percent. Crucially, it\u2019s unclear that anyone thought about this at all.  Online, some speculated that the tariffs were doled out according to internet domains, and that because the Heart Island and McDonald Islands use a different domain (.hm) than Australia, (.au) they were considered different countries. That seemed to be the only explanation for levying a tariff on a territory that has no economy to speak of. Donald Trump claimed Wednesday that the United States entered the Great Depression as a result of turning its back on the policy of placing tariffs on other countries in favor of an income tax.  During a winding speech to mark the so-called Liberation Day, Trump presented an alternative history where steep tariffs, like the ones he\u2019d come to celebrate, could have prevented the worldwide economic disintegration of the early twentieth century.  \u201cFrom 1789 to 1913 we were a tariff-backed nation, and the United States was proportionately the wealthiest it has ever been,\u201d Trump said, adding that the U.S. was \u201ccollecting so much money, so fast, we didn\u2019t know what to do with it! \u201cThen, in 1913 for reasons unknown to mankind, they established the income tax so citizens, rather than foreign countries, would start paying the money necessary to run our government,\u201d he said. \u201cThen in 1928 it all came to a very abrupt end with the Great Depression, and it would have never happened if they had stayed with the tariff policy; it would have been a much different story,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey tried to bring back tariffs to save our country, but it was gone. It was gone. It was too late, nothing could have been done.\u201d Trump\u2019s revisionist history is designed to promote his economic agenda\u2014not reflect what actually happened. Not only could tariffs not have prevented the Great Depression, they made it even worse.  In 1913, as the result of struggling farmers and Democrats advocating to establish an income tax, Republicans put up an income tax amendment, hoping that it would be rejected\u2014it wasn\u2019t, and the Sixteenth Amendment became law.  At the same time, Congress passed the Underwood Simmons Tariff Act that lowered tariff rates from 40 percent to 27 percent, in a Democrat-backed effort to promote free trade. Crucially, tariffs were raised again in 1921, after Republican President Warren Harding entered the White House and began a reinvigorated era of protectionism.  In 1930, Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which raised tariffs in all sectors and is considered to have exacerbated the worldwide economic downturn that lasted from 1929 until 1939, by undermining international trade and affording little protection to domestic producers.  Smoot-Hawley was disastrous not only for the U.S. economy, tanking U.S. exports to Europe from $2,341 million in 1929 to just $784 million in 1932, but also for global trade, which declined by a whopping 66 percent between 1929 and 1934, according to\u00a0 the U.S. Office of the Historian. The effects of Smoot-Hawley were so awful that it marked the end of steep tariffs in American trade policy for the rest of the twentieth century. Trump\u2019s baseless insistence that lowered tariffs led to the Great Depression is representative of his entire economic policy, and just how untethered from reality it has become.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"They won\u2019t bring back manufacturing either. They won\u2019t bring back manufacturing either. by  Victoria Song If you were wondering how President Trump\u2019s tariffs may impact gadgets like smartphones, laptops, and smartwatches, there\u2019s some bad, and perhaps slightly less-bad news. Unless something changes, Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs will lead to increased prices for consumers. But it will likely take some time before that actually happens. Modern gadgets generally aren\u2019t made or assembled solely in the U.S. anymore. Device makers, big and small, source components from all over the world, and often have them assembled overseas before importing the final product into the country. Given that Trump has levied tariffs on every single country, it means that the cost to make all our devices will inevitably go up. \u201cThe biggest thing right now is going to be the inflationary impact,\u201d says Jason Miller, professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University. \u201cIf they stay in place for several months, we\u2019ll start to see those effects by mid-summer and certainly back-to-school season.\u201d Miller notes goods shipped from China to the U.S. will face a whopping 54 percent tariffs, including most gadgets. Vietnam, where Apple has shifted some of its manufacturing, also has a high tariff rate at 46 percent. \u201cIf [companies] absorb the extra cost and don\u2019t pass it on, their profits are going to plunge and their capital investment will drop,\u201d says Miller. \u201cOr, they\u2019ll pass a good share of it onto the downstream buyer, which in many instances is the consumer.\u201d Barring any new exemptions or changes, you can expect every single device category to be negatively impacted, says Ryan Reith, group vice president of worldwide device trackers at IDC. But devices will be impacted differently. Smartphones, says Reith, have more wiggle room than TVs or PCs as they have a \u201cwell-established monthly hardware payment dependence.\u201d Miller agrees, noting that it\u2019s not likely that a smartphone will suddenly be 50 percent more expensive. A more reasonable expectation would be a roughly 20 percent bump. Other devices, like over-the-counter hearing aids, have even thinner margins and are therefore, much more vulnerable. \u201cMost hearing aids are manufactured in Europe or Asia, and many are assembled in countries like China, \u201d says Blake Cadwell, CEO of Soundly, an online retailer that sells over-the-counter hearing aids. Cadwell says manufacturers and brands he\u2019s spoken to are anticipating as much as a 25 to 50 percent increase in costs. Those kinds of increases, Cadwell says, could have a lasting impact on consumers. The slightly less-bad news is that consumers likely won\u2019t see any price increases right away. That\u2019s because some device makers have increased inventory in anticipation of tariffs hitting. Miller says in the past few months, computer imports were over 70 percent higher than 2023, while cell phone imports in February 2025 were the highest since 2022. Cadwell also says Soundly is working to build reserves and that based on current inventory levels, it\u2019s likely price increases won\u2019t hit the market until fall. However, that\u2019s not a guarantee that this is true for every single device maker and every gadget category. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at a laptop that\u2019s assembled in China, and you\u2019re wondering whether to buy now or wait until the fall, I would buy now.\u201d \u201dVendors\/channels have been stretching existing inventory as much as they can to avoid price increases, but close deadlines announced yesterday for tariff increases significantly ramp up the pressure. I\u2019d be surprised if even the best positioned brands in terms of inventory are able to stretch two to three weeks beyond the new tariff deadlines,\u201d says Reith. In other words, if you currently have an aging piece of tech that needs replacing, it may be a good idea to do it before inventory runs out. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at a laptop that\u2019s assembled in China, and you\u2019re wondering whether to buy now or wait until the fall, I would buy now,\u201d says Miller. As for whether these tariffs could potentially encourage Big Tech to restart domestic manufacturing, it\u2019s highly unlikely. Even with these tariffs in place, it\u2019s still cheaper for these companies to manufacture devices like smartphones, laptops, and wearables overseas. And even if they did want to move some industry back home, that wouldn\u2019t be possible overnight. The U.S. has lost a lot of its manufacturing capacity, particularly for consumer electronics, in the last few decades. Simon Ellis, group vice president at IDC, notes that the firm hasn\u2019t seen reshoring as a high priority in recent supply chain surveys. \u201cIt\u2019s also important to remember that \u2018made in America\u2019 has almost always meant \u2018assembled in America\u2019 with parts coming from all over the world,\u201d he says, while acknowledging it\u2019s possible that a growing number of companies may assess a return even though the cost, uncertainty, and time required are huge hurdles. Miller is a bit more blunt. \u201cThese tariffs in no way would encourage domestic production of the types of devices that we\u2019re talking about.\u201d  A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge\u2019s universe. \u00a9 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"President Donald Trump announced widespread tariffs on Wednesday, sending the stock market plunging. One of the more significant of these tariffs is a 20% levy on goods coming from longtime U.S. ally and trade partner the European Union. EU chief Ursula von der Leyen in a press conference on Thursday said the bloc is finalizing a package of retaliatory tariffs on up to roughly $28.4 billion worth of U.S. goods in response to the 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum that took effect last month.  While the E.U. is prioritizing negotations, Von der Leyen said the Commission is also now preparing for \u201cfurther countermeasures\u201d if discussions fail. Negotiation efforts by the bloc have so far been rebuffed by the Trump administration. The first set of countermeasures will be announced on April 14, EU parliamentary trade committee chair Bernd Lange told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle on Thursday, with the second set likely to come in a month. These countermeasures could target large tech firms, according to European government officials. French government spokesperson Sophie Primas said the EU\u2019s response would \u201cattack online services,\u201d while German economy minister Robert Habeck said everything is on the table when it comes to countermeasures, adding: \u201cThe big tech companies have an incredible dominance in Europe and are largely exempt from European taxes.\u201d Relations between the EU and U.S. have been growing sour, particularly since Trump\u2019s election in November. Trump and other administration officials including FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson, are vocally upset about Europe\u2019s antitrust crackdown on American Big Tech companies, something the administration views as \u201coverseas extortion and unfair fines and penalties.\u201d Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) were among the major tech names classified as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d under the 2022 Digital Markets Act, a landmark European antitrust law intended to address anti-competitive practices in the tech industry. All of the magnificent seven tech stocks are down today on the tariffs news. Leading the drop is Apple. Just last month, Google and Apple were found in violation of the DMA, and were sent preliminary findings and action requests respectively. If the companies fail to comply with the orders, they face potential fines, including a fine for Alphabet that would amount to up to 10% of its worldwide revenue. In 2024, Alphabet\u2019s worldwide revenue reached approximately $350 billion. The European Commission is expected to issue its first fines under the DMA to Apple and Meta very soon, Politico reported earlier this week. The wider trade environment has factored into EU\u2019s decision on the matter, even though the act is technically overseen by the European Commission\u2019s competition and digital directorates, according to Politico, which cited a person briefed on the matter. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company executives have been asking Trump and his trade officials to pressure Brussels to drop the anticipated fines and a cease-and-desist order, according to a Wall Street Journal report from Monday. Meta is reportedly worried that the EU could ask it to sell less personalized ads on it platforms, according to the WSJ, which could undercut its revenue in the region. \u201cEurope is likely to fight back. It is not likely to withdraw its antitrust and DMA enforcement against the American firms. But whether Trump\u2019s bullying will chill Europe\u2019s enforcement, we have to wait and see. Europe wants to stand firm,\u201d legal scholar and New York University professor of trade regulation Eleanor Fox told Quartz, calling the antitrust probes \u201centirely legitimate.\u201d Europe has shown that \u201cthey\u2019re willing to step back,\u201d and \u201creinterpret the penalties that might be involved,\u201d Brookings senior fellow Dan Hamilton said. But if this scales into a \u201cfull blown trade war,\u201d the bloc would not shy away from levying major fines on the companies that could even go beyond the antitrust probes. A greater threat to Silicon Valley in the EU\u2019s arsenal is the \u201canti-coercion instrument,\u201d often referred to as a \u201cbazooka.\u201d Created during Trump\u2019s first term but used mainly against China thus far, the ACI allows the EU to impose trade restrictions on services, intellectual property rights, and foreign direct investment if a country is deemed to be using tariffs on goods to coerce policy changes in the EU. The law is used mostly as a deterrent, but it can be utilized against U.S. tech giants that provide digital services, like Apple, Google, and Meta.  Even in that case, however, Hamilton says it can take \u201cmonths and months\u201d for the EU to conduct an investigation and get a qualified majority to agree on enacting the ACI. An attack on the services economy would hurt U.S. companies big time.  \u201cEurope\u2019s where they make their money, it\u2019s the most profitable place in the world for U.S. companies,\u201d Hamilton said, before adding that the services economies of Europe and the U.S. are so deeply intertwined that it will likely hurt Europeans as well. Hamilton says the real problem at hand for Big Tech is not even retaliatory tariffs, but potential court orders over data privacy. U.S. data privacy frameworks have been invalidated by EU courts in the past over being deemed not private enough for European data. To address that, former President Joe Biden signed a Data Privacy Framework with the EU that puts significant importance on an oversight board that would ensure alignment with EU data protection standards. In January, Trump fired all three Democrats on the bipartisan oversight board, stirring concern in the European Parliament. If deemed inadequate, EU courts have the power to shut down data flows across the Atlantic.  Any court decision as such would have \u201cfar more serious\u201d implications than any fine, Hamilton said. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"     Expect to pay more for everything but experts warn against panic-buying if it leads to debt.    New tariffs on imports could mean you'll soon have to pay more for electronics. President Donald Trump's new sweeping tariffs on US imports sparked fears of trade wars and threatened to raise prices on everything we buy, including Apple products.\u00a0 The cost of the latest tech seems to rise every year but experts warn that\u00a0smartphone and laptop prices could climb even higher because of the massive tariffs this year.\u00a0 In addition to imposing tariffs on goods from nearly 200 countries, Trump announced this week that he was adding a 34% tariff to goods from China, where Apple produces the majority of its products. He had already increased tariff rates on China by 20% since February. \u00a0 Experts predict that the cumulative 54% tariff hike will raise prices for products manufactured in China, including\u00a0iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and AirPods. But it's unclear exactly how much of an impact it will actually have on prices. \"Expect 20% to 40% higher prices, although demand could plummet,\"\u00a0Patti Brennan, certified financial planner and CEO of Key Financial, said in an email. \"If or when that happens, prices could fall.\" Others say Apple could absorb more costs early on to stay competitive with the rest of the tech market. \"The tariffs could increase Apple product prices by about 10% in the coming months, which could lead to price increases of $50 to $150 on higher-end products like the iPhone Pro Max models and MacBook Pros,\" Stephan Shipe, a certified financial planner and CEO of Scholar Financial Advising, said in an email.\u00a0 Best Buy and Target warned consumers last month to expect higher prices for everything, after the latest round of tariffs\u00a0went into effect. February's tariff hike had already prompted Acer to announce that it was raising prices on its laptops.\u00a0 If you're in the market for a new Apple device or an imported gaming system, like the Nintendo Switch 2 or\u00a0PlayStation 5 Pro, here's how tariffs could raise prices, and what you should do to prepare. Trump announced a 10% baseline tariff on all imports plus \"reciprocal tariffs\" on imports from more than 180 countries April 2, which he dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" He's long touted tariffs as a way to even the trade deficit and raise revenue to offset tax cuts, although many economists say that tariffs could lead to higher prices and may end up hurting the US economy. US stock prices have plummeted\u00a0since Trump's announcement as markets reacted poorly to the sweeping tariffs. Trump has taken an especially hard stance on China, which was already subject to tariffs that Trump ordered during his first term in office. The latest round of tariffs means prices for these goods could rise even higher. China has responded to each round of tariffs with its own set of tariffs on US products, including coal, crude oil and farm products such as chicken, beef, soybeans, wheat and pork.\u00a0 Tariffs, in theory, are designed to financially impact other countries because their goods are being taxed. Tariffs are paid by the US company importing the product, and this upcharge is usually -- but not always -- passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices. Tariffs levied on products from China -- and everywhere else -- will likely translate into higher prices for consumers. That means the tech you use every day, like imported smartphones, tablets, laptops, TVs and kitchen appliances, could get even more expensive this year. If the full cost is passed on to shoppers, we'd see a 54% increase in prices on Apple products produced in China. Apple has moved some of its production to other countries, including India, Malaysia and Vietnam. But they were each hit with their own tariffs yesterday -- Vietnam saw a 46% tariff hike. Apple also sources components for its products from a long list of countries, all now facing new tariffs. If Apple did raise its prices in direct proportion to this year's Chinese tariff hikes, the iPhone 16, which starts at $830 at T-Mobile, could jump up to $1,278. You can get a 15-inch MacBook Air starting at $1,199 on Amazon; a 54% hike would raise the base price to $1,846. However, a tariff on goods doesn't necessarily mean prices will go up by the same amount. If companies want to stay competitive, they could absorb some of the costs to keep their prices lower.\u00a0 Apple announced a $100 price cut on its new MacBook Air last month, a day after the last round of tariffs took effect. In what was widely viewed as an attempt to persuade Trump to \"carve out\" an exemption from the latest tariffs, Apple announced in February that it would spend more than $500 billion in the next four years to expand manufacturing operations in the US. \"They already committed $500 billion to US manufacturing, and there was no carve out for Apple,\" Brennan said. \"They will have to pass along most of these costs to consumers.\" Read more: Higher Tariffs Could Make Going Solar More Expensive If you were planning on buying a new iPhone, gaming console, MacBook or other tech, buying it now could save you money. But if you don't have the cash on hand and plan to use a credit card or buy now, pay later plan just to avoid tariffs, experts say to make sure you have the money to cover the costs before you start accruing interest. With credit cards' average interest rates currently more than 20%, the cost of financing a big purchase could quickly wipe out any savings you'd get by buying before prices go up because of tariffs. \"The decision to buy would depend on immediate need vs. a tolerance for a small potential price increase,\" Shipe said. One way to save on Apple products, even if prices go up, is to buy last year's model instead of the newest release. \"If you aren't planning to upgrade in the next year, there is no need to rush out to buy a new smartphone,\" Shawn DuBravac, chief economist at IPC, a manufacturing trade association, said in an email. \"Technology is naturally deflationary, meaning that over time performance goes up and prices generally go down for products of similar quality.\"","label":0}
{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs\u00e2\u0080\u0094which have been called \u201ca complete fucking joke,\u201d \u201cinsane and idiotic,\u201d and \u201cprobably the most stupid economic step taken by a president in this generation\u201c\u00e2\u0080\u0094haven\u2019t even gone into effect yet, but economists, Wall Street, and people who value their 401Ks are all freaking out with equal abandon. With the stock market in free-fall and decades-long international trade partnerships in tatters, Trump is promising that his policies will somehow \u201cmake America wealthy again.\u201d Financial experts, however, are predicting disaster and, to kick things off, carmaker Stellantis has now announced the layoff of 900 people working at its U.S. warehouses. The carmaker said it would \u201cpause\u201d production at a number of its car assembly plants located in Canada and Mexico, CNN reports. At the same time, the company says that it will lay off 900 hourly workers in the U.S. who are responsible for making the parts that are sent to those manufacturing plants. For the time being, the layoffs are temporary, with the company claiming the suspension of operations is necessary to adjust to reduced production spurred by Trump\u2019s tariffs. The laid-off workers are employed at five plants scattered throughout Michigan and Indiana. Due to their union contracts, they will be able to maintain their pay for the immediate future. Additionally, Stellantis has said it will suspend operations at assembly plants in Canada and Mexico, both of which employ thousands of hourly workers. In an internal memo viewed by CNN, a top executive tied the workforce cuts to Trump\u2019s policies. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThese are actions that we do not take lightly, but they are necessary given the current market dynamics,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Antonio Filosa, Stellantis\u2019 chief operating officer for the Americas. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe understand that the current environment creates uncertainty. Be assured that we are very engaged with all of our key stakeholders, including top government leaders, unions, suppliers, and dealers in the US, Canada, and Mexico, as we work to manage and adapt to these changes.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Other layoffs were announced Thursday, though they weren\u2019t blamed directly on federal policy. Whirlpool, the washing machine manufacturer, said it would be laying off 651 workers from its facility in Amana, Iowa. The layoffs represent approximately one-third of Whirlpool\u2019s workforce in Amana, the Des Moines Register reports. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is really about aligning to current market conditions driven by consumer demand, particularly as it relates to some of the appliances (refrigeration) made in Amana,\u00e2\u0080\u009d a statement from the company says. The disruption to business operations is likely to continue. While the global economy is currently in a state of suspended uncertainty, many people are expecting mass layoffs and price hikes throughout the U.S. It\u2019s unclear what the long-term picture looks like but most economists seem to agree: It doesn\u2019t look good.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Now wielding Blackwell power and a chassis that can actually breathe. Alienware has revived its heaviest hitter. The Area-51 gaming laptop has officially returned and it's aiming straight for the top of the food chain. First teased back at CES 2025, the new models are available to order right now. $3,199.99 See here You\u2019ve got two sizes to pick from: the 16-inch version starts at $3,199.99, and the 18-inch model comes in at $3,399.99. Both are expected to start shipping on April 30, assuming you beat the pre-order rush and don\u2019t get bumped to next month. Or next year. $3,399.99 See here Inside, it's all business. Alienware is pairing Intel's new Core Ultra 9 275HX CPU with the equally fresh NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080. The CPU is clocking up to 5.4GHz with 24 cores and 40MB cache, currently topping the Passmark charts for laptop processors. Meanwhile, early benchmarks put the 5080 at 16% faster than the RTX 4080 mobile, and that\u2019s before DLSS 4 comes into play. Both sizes come stock with a QHD+ display (16\" or 18\"), running between 240Hz and 300Hz with G-Sync support. You also get 32GB of DDR5 RAM, 1TB of SSD storage, and the option to bump up to 64GB\/2TB if you\u2019ve got room in the budget. Spoiler: the budget will not be small. Cooling has finally caught up with performance. Alienware swapped the chassis for a new magnesium alloy shell with larger airflow cutouts, more copper, and a thermal interface upgrade that lets this machine handle up to 240W TDP without sounding like it\u2019s about to lift off. It\u2019s still heavy\u20147.5 lbs for the 16\", 9.6 lbs for the 18\"\u2014but at least it won\u2019t melt itself into your desk. Design-wise, they ditched the sharp edges for rounded corners, concealed hinges, and the usual loadout of custom RGB zones. Connectivity isn\u2019t lacking either, with USB Type-A, Thunderbolt, HDMI 2.1, and a card reader all included. But if the $3K+ club isn\u2019t for you? There\u2019s a more wallet-friendly Alienware option worth checking out. Alienware m16 R2 might not come with a 5080, but at $1,699.99, it still packs a punch. $1,699.99 See here You\u2019re getting an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H, RTX 4060, 16GB DDR5, and a slick QHD+ 240Hz panel with G-Sync. It weighs less, costs less, and still runs circles around most mid-range builds. If you don\u2019t need 24 cores and copper plumbing just to play Apex, this one will do just fine.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Scale of US president\u2019s tariff plans takes investors by surprise, sending stock markets tumbling. After weeks of anticipation, global investors finally have sight of United States President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs. If the reaction of the stock market is any guide, the \u201cliberation day\u201d tariffs unveiled on Wednesday exceeded their worst fears. From the US to Asia to Europe, markets tumbled as investors absorbed the implications of the sharpest turn towards protectionism by the world\u2019s largest economy since the 1930s. Futures tied to the US\u2019s benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 \u2013 which can be traded outside usual market hours \u2013 dropped more than 3 percent and 3.5 percent respectively, setting the stage for heavy losses when Wall Street reopens on Thursday. Japan\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 dropped as much as 4.5 percent, while South Korea\u2019s KOSPI and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng each fell more than 2 percent. In Vietnam, the benchmark VN-Index suffered one of the worst days in its history, plunging more than 6 percent. \u201cThe hike in tariffs was more aggressive than expected,\u201d Lynn Song, chief economist for greater China at Dutch bank ING, told Al Jazeera. \u201cMany were expecting a range of 10-20 percent tariffs. This sort of aggressive move will probably risk some retaliation from the bigger players, though smaller countries could choose to try and negotiate for a lower rate.\u201d Daniel Ives, an analyst with Los Angeles-based wealth management firm Wedbush Securities, went as far as to describe Trump\u2019s plans as \u201cworse than the worst-case scenario\u201d. While Trump announced a baseline 10 percent tariff for all imports to the US, he confirmed that much higher duties would be imposed on dozens of other countries. The steeper rates apply to both major US trading partners and smaller economies \u2013 and allies and rivals \u2013 alike. China, the US\u2019s third-largest trading partner accounting for more than $430bn worth of US imports annually, is facing a 34 percent tariff. When added to Trump\u2019s previous tariffs on Chinese goods, the latest tariff lifts the overall rate to 54 percent.      \u201cIn our view, the scale and speed of the new Trump administration\u2019s additional tariffs and other measures against China are much worse than markets had expected, though these events unfolding are consistent with our more cautious views,\u201d Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura, said in a note. The European Union is set to be hit with a 20 percent tariff, while Japan and South Korea are facing duties of 24 percent and 26 percent, respectively. Some of the steepest rates have been applied to developing economies that potentially have the most to lose from serious disruptions to trade, including Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Laos, which are facing tariffs of 44-49 percent. Trump\u2019s list included exemptions for a limited number of goods, including semiconductors, oil and pharmaceutical products. \u201cThese tariff figures are worse than expected \u2013 certainly viewed from Asia, where everyone got hit. An export-dependent region is going to really struggle with sudden, huge price increases,\u201d\u00a0 Deborah Elms, the head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore, told Al Jazeera. \u201cThis will result in a loss of jobs in markets that are already poor and often fragile.\u201d China and the EU, the world\u2019s two largest economies, have already promised to retaliate with their own trade measures, though many smaller trade-reliant economies are seen as hesitant to respond in any way that might exacerbate trade tensions further. After weeks of market volatility due to uncertainty over Trump\u2019s plans, a key question is whether the tariffs could be eased in negotiations between Washington and its trade partners. \u201cThe tariff announcement doesn\u2019t eliminate uncertainty, but it hopefully puts a boundary around how bad the economic consequences will be,\u201d Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, told Al Jazeera. \u201cIncluding non-tariff barriers in the calculation has pushed the tariff higher than it otherwise would be. That\u2019s also the part that is hardest to quantify, so perhaps it leaves a large door open to negotiations. Framing these tariffs as reciprocal will hopefully reduce the likelihood of retaliation.\u201d      Gary Ng, a senior economist with the investment bank Natixis in Hong Kong, said that while he expects US trade partners to work towards a compromise, it is likely that at least some of the measures will become permanent. \u201cRegardless of what the deal is, it is highly likely that the US will keep part of the tariffs for everyone,\u201d Ng told Al Jazeera. While the severity of Trump\u2019s tariffs seemed to take many investors by surprise, there is room for stocks to fall much further still \u2013 depending on the administration\u2019s next moves. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs have put the likelihood of Trump\u2019s protectionist policies tipping the US economy into a recession this year at 40 percent and 35 percent, respectively. Veljko Fotak, an associate professor of finance at the University at Buffalo, said the market does not see Trump\u2019s latest announcement as the final word on tariffs. \u201cIf that were the case, markets would be falling a lot more dramatically, as this kind of tariff regime would effectively guarantee a recession. The long-run tariff policy remains uncertain \u2013 how will other countries react? Will the US escalate? Will it pull back?\u201d Fotak told Al Jazeera. \u201cMarkets did react forcefully, but we will see further downward corrections if these tariffs persist \u2013 and more dramatic movements if the trade war escalates.\u201d          Follow Al Jazeera English:","label":1}
{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  Donald Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" means that tariffs are suddenly everywhere. That means tariff memes are also everywhere.          The US president on Wednesday signed an executive order imposing a 10% baseline tariff on all countries, taking effect Saturday, and adding reciprocal tariffs.       Global markets plummeted on the news.               But if there's one thing you can count on amid any turmoil \u2014 financial or otherwise \u2014 it's that some people will always have a sense of humor about it, even if it's a little dark. So, social media users have been expressing their economic fears and anxieties the modern way: with memes.               Here are some of the best ones:               Enjoy, for example, the picture showing Trump yelling, \"Pay the tariffs!\" at a group of penguins.                  Tariffs memes are the hottest thing right now, so post your favorites pic.twitter.com\/WQphddVZPo           \u2014 Pekka Kallioniemi (@P_Kallioniemi) April 3, 2025           Trump's tariffs include the Australian territory of the Heard Island and McDonald Islands \u2014 a pair of sub-Antarctic remote islands uninhabited by humans but home to penguins, sea birds, and seals.               The meme refers to one that originated in 2017, in which Trump appeared as if he was yelling at an 11-year-old boy who had asked to mow the White House lawn.               Another meme shows Marvel superhero Wolverine lying in bed, looking longingly at a Studio Ghibli-fied picture of former US Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin and his wife, Louise Linton, holding a sheet of new $1 bills. Mnuchin was Treasury Secretary during Trump's first term in office.               Users of OpenAI's ChatGPT have recently started a trend of using the AI chatbot to turn regular photos into pictures in the distinctive style of Studio Ghibli, the animation studio behind films like \"Spirited Away\" and \"Howl's Moving Castle.\"               In the original photo in 2017, Mnuchin was at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington, D.C., to see the first run of $1 bills featuring his signature. At the time, the image of the chicly dressed couple posing with money quickly drew comparisons to James Bond-esque villains, but the new image makes it seem like the person who posted it might have preferred that to today's market chaos.               A different meme shows Patrick Schwarzenegger as Saxon Ratliff in season 3 of \"The White Lotus,\" a zeitgeisty \u2014 and heavily memeified \u2014 HBO show. He plays a toxic finance bro on a family vacation.               \"Look, the prices of goods going up and my portfolio going down isn't necessarily a bad thing, because I love working and that just means I need to grind even harder now,\" the person captioned the photo.                  Look, the prices of goods going up and my portfolio going down isnt necessarily a bad thing, because I love working and that just means I need to grind even harder now pic.twitter.com\/xVxhCfepPd           \u2014 litquidity (@litcapital) April 3, 2025           And who could forget the famous \"Arrested Development\" meme of rich matriarch Lucille Bluth estimating a banana costs $10? The joke is supposed to highlight how wealthy and out-of-touch Bluth is, but \"unironically this is what's happening in America right now,\" one person wrote on X.               \"Just got off the phone with my financial advisor, he just told me my 401k is now a 400k,\" a different person tweeted, alongside a photo of late comedian and actor Rodney Dangerfield.               And finally, one user tweeted an image of a stock heatmap almost entirely red with a superimposed image of Vice President JD Vance asking, \"Have you said thank you once?\"                  Have you?#stockmarketcrash#tariffspic.twitter.com\/dZFInpG5ff           \u2014 Mohamed (@itsjustmohamed_) April 2, 2025           Vance was photoshopped to appear to have a larger face, which has been a trending meme in recent weeks. The question is a reference to Trump and Vance's contentious meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February. In that meeting, Vance chastised Zelenskyy for not wearing a suit and asked him, \"Have you said thank you once?\" regarding American aid to the country, which Russia invaded in 2022.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"The Duke of Sussex says he hopes the Charity Commission will \"unveil the truth\" as the watchdog announced an investigation into the bitter dispute surrounding the Sentebale charity he co-founded. \"What has transpired over the last week has been heartbreaking to witness, especially when such blatant lies hurt those who have invested decades in this shared goal,\" said Prince Harry. The watchdog said it had opened a case to examine \"concerns raised\" about Sentebale, following claims made by its head Sophie Chandauka. Ms Chandauka told the BBC she welcomed the move by the commission, which comes after she said she had \"blown the whistle\" on issues including bullying and harassment. An acrimonious boardroom battle led to Prince Harry, his co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho and trustees resigning from their roles last week, after Ms Chandauka had resisted attempts to remove her as chair.  The duke, speaking on behalf of the former trustees and patrons, welcomed the watchdog's announcement, saying it would be a \"robust inquiry\" which \"we fully expect will unveil the truth that collectively forced us to resign\".  \"We remain hopeful this will allow for the charity to be put in the right hands immediately, for the sake of the communities we serve,\" said the prince. \"From the inception of Sentebale nearly 20 years ago, Prince Seeiso and I have had a clear goal - to support the children and young people in southern Africa in memory of our mothers,\" his statement added. The Charity Commission's \"regulatory compliance case\" is the first step in assessing the complaints and allegations over what has happened at Sentebale, which was founded in 2006 to help children in southern Africa affected by HIV and Aids. A statement from the watchdog said it was \"in direct contact with parties who have raised concerns\" and would gather evidence to see whether those running the charity, past and present, had complied with their \"duties and responsibilities under charity law\". Ms Chandauka previously said she had reported the trustees to the Charity Commission, and made a whistleblower complaint about issues including what she described as an abuse of power, bullying, sexism and racism. On Thursday, Ms Chandauka said in a statement that the concerns brought to the commission included \"governance, administration and management matters\". The Sentebale head said she hoped the public and donors would now see there was a new board of trustees \"acting appropriately to demonstrate and ensure good governance and a healthy culture\". Insiders have claimed personality clashes and tensions around leadership had added to Sentebale's challenges - and the watchdog is likely to hear financial concerns from some of those formerly involved with running the charity. \"It is devastating that the relationship between the charity's trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation,\" those trustees leaving the charity said a statement. Among the likely claims are that \u00a3500,000 of Sentebale's money was spent on consultants in a strategy to get donations from wealthy individuals and foundations in the US, but which sources close to the former trustees say had not delivered adequate results. The financial fears come despite the charity receiving an extra \u00a31.2m from Prince Harry's earnings from his best-selling memoir Spare.  A Sentebale spokeswoman rejected the claim that \u00a3500,000 had been spent on US consultants - and defended its approach to seeking new funds for the charity. Sources also claim Ms Chandauka had raised funding to cover the cost of the consultants and that her own family had become significant donors to the charity. Sentebale told the BBC it had hired a US firm called Lebec to help build a new fundraising strategy, and that by October 2024 a team of six consultants had set up 65 key relationships with potential donors, who might help Sentebale in the future. It said the 12-month deal with Lebec, a women-led strategy firm, had successfully delivered links to \"high-net-worth individuals, family offices, corporations, foundations and partner non-profits\". \"Lebec provided the positioning strategy, the tools, and the insights to enter the US market successfully and with credibility,\" a spokeswoman for Sentebale said. The one-off donation from Prince Harry from his Spare book was \"incredibly useful\" but did not represent a long-term \"funding pipeline\", said Sentebale. The dispute has become increasingly personal. Ms Chandauka has argued the controversy around Prince Harry leaving the UK had become a barrier to potential donors. She previously said the \"toxicity\" of his brand was the \"number one risk for this organisation\". Ms Chandauka also spoke about a dispute over a video at a fundraising polo match, where it had been claimed Meghan was manoeuvring her out of the way during a prize-giving ceremony. \"Prince Harry asked me to issue some sort of a statement in support of the duchess and I said I wouldn't,\" said Ms Chandauka. Sources close to Prince Harry and Meghan have rejected suggestions there was any conflict or anything negative about how the prize line-up was organised, saying it had been misrepresented. They say the full video with sound shows Meghan politely helping the group get ready for the photo by asking: \"Do you want to come over here?\". Ms Chandauka says she and her leadership team are focusing on the day-to-day operations of the charity, and looking forward to working with their supporters as \"we recalibrate for an ambitious future\". Financial worries and fundraising rows inflamed boardroom battle that engulfed Sentebale, insiders claim. The Duke of Sussex left his role with Sentebale after the relationship between its trustees and chair broke down. The prince's exit from Sentebale after an internal row has echoes of his decision to step back as a royal. The Duke of Sussex says he and the prince of Lesotho left Sentebale amid a row between the trustees and the chair of its board.

The chipmaker\u2019s shares were down 6.6% during pre-market trading on Thursday morning, less than a day after President Donald Trump announced reciprocal tariffs against U.S. trade partners. At the market open Thursday, Nvidia\u2019s shares were down 4.9% \u2014 and then fell an additional 1.3% during mid-day trading. The company ended the day down 7.8% at the market close. However, Altimeter Capital chief executive Brad Gerstner told CNBC that he expects Nvidia to fair well amid the Trump administration\u2019s new tariffs. \u201cThe growth and the demand for GPUs is off the charts,\u201d Gerstner said during an appearance on \u201cFast Money Halftime Report.\u201d He added that semiconductors are exempted from the tariffs \u2014 a \u201cwise exception\u201d \u2014 because of the global AI race.

Lee said Nvidia had previously had strong pricing power due to its dominance of the market for graphics processing units, or GPUs, which are essential to powering generative artificial intelligence models, according to MarketWatch (NWSA). However, that pricing power could have less of an impact in the future, as the company hasn\u2019t raised average selling prices. It \u201cis likely to cap earnings upside momentum,\u201d Lee reportedly said in the note. He also noted that Nvidia\u2019s earnings and guidance beats in the last three quarters have been shrinking, due to \u201cincreasing market focus on Nvidia\u2019s earnings as well ongoing uncertainty over its Blackwell supply chain ramp-up.\u201d Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

The tariffs have roiled the economy, with JP Morgan Chase\u2019s chief economist warning Thursday the president\u2019s policies \u201ctake the economy perilously close to slipping into recession,\u201d as the tariffs are expected to broadly raise prices on most goods, shrinking consumer spending and Americans\u2019 disposable income while raising inflation rates. The stock market took a nosedive Thursday morning with the major stock indexes registering their worst day since September 2022, with major tech stocks like Apple and retail giants like Walmart and Nike particularly struggling. Nearly all of them, except for Russia, Belarus, North Korea and Cuba. Canada and Mexico were also not mentioned in Trump\u2019s Wednesday announcement, as he has already previously imposed tariffs on the country\u2019s U.S. imports. Among the most noteworthy tariffs were those levied on China, which will now see 54% tariffs on imports to the U.S.\u2014as Trump raised the existing tariff rate by an additional 34%\u2014along with a 46% tariff on goods from Vietnam, 20% on goods from the European Union, 32% on goods from Taiwan, 24% on goods from Japan and 26% on goods from India. Trump also imposed 10% tariffs on imports from the Heard and McDonald Islands\u2014a tax that will likely be irrelevant for the Australian territory, as it is completely uninhabited. Yes. While Trump has broad authority to enact sweeping tariffs, Congress could pass legislation that reins in his power and gives lawmakers more control over tariffs, the Congressional Research Service notes. Doing so could curb Trump\u2019s broad tariffs and some of their fallout in the economy, though the GOP-controlled House and Senate are so far unlikely to try and restrict the president. Only four Republican senators broke with Trump and supported a resolution Wednesday against the president\u2019s tariffs on Canada, and the House is unlikely to take up the proposal at all. Some Republicans have expressed some concerns about the tariffs\u2019 likely impact on the economy, with Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., telling CNN, \u201cAnyone who says there may be a little bit of pain [from the tariffs]  Trump rolled out his tariffs Wednesday at the White House as part of a \u201cLiberation Day\u201d event, as the president delivered on one of his signature campaign policies. While Trump has long promised sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, he had so far imposed tariffs only on goods from Canada, Mexico and China\u2014though even those had sparked widespread pushback, turmoil in the stock market and retaliatory tariffs. Trump has pushed ahead with his tariff agenda despite longstanding warnings from economists that doing so would result in higher prices for consumers, debunking the president\u2019s claims that foreign countries would absorb the costs. Polls suggest Americans are largely opposed to the president\u2019s agenda on tariffs, with a Marquette Law School poll released Wednesday finding 58% of U.S. adults believe tariffs hurt the economy.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"ByGiacomo Tognini  ByGiacomo Tognini,  Forbes Staff.  Mark Zuckerberg (left), Jeff Bezos (center) and Elon Musk (right) at Donald Trump's inauguration in January, alongside Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Bezos' fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez. Editor's note: This article was updated after the stock market close at 4 pm Eastern time on April 3, 2025. P resident Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that the U.S. would impose a flat 10% tariff on every country in the world, with higher rates for many of America\u2019s largest trading partners including China, India, Japan, South Korea, the U.K. and the European Union. The news sent stock markets tumbling around the world on Thursday, with the S&P 500 index down 5% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite down 6%. Stock markets in Japan, Hong Kong and Europe also suffered losses. That rout wiped a collective $270 billion from the fortunes of the world\u2019s 3,000 billionaires. The biggest losers so far are the very richest people in the world, particularly those who have cozied up to Trump in recent times. No one has been hit harder than Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, whose fortune is down by $17.9 billion since yesterday\u2019s stock market close, as shares of the Facebook parent plummeted by 9%. Zuckerberg, who sat next to Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk at Trump\u2019s inauguration in January after Meta donated to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee, has also met with the president at the White House several times since then\u2014most recently on Wednesday. The second-biggest loser so far? Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, who has recently tried to grow closer to Trump, sitting in the second row behind the president at his inauguration in January after Amazon donated to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee. In February, he announced the Washington Post\u2014which he bought for $250 million in 2013\u2014would change its opinion pages to focus on supporting personal liberties and free markets. A month later, he opined on tariffs, saying in an X post that the opinion pages would cover \"the damaging and distorting effects if tariffs are used to pick winners and losers.\" With Amazon shares down 9%, Bezos is $16 billion poorer on Thursday. Larry Ellison, the founder of software giant Oracle, is down $9.9 billion, thanks to a 6% drop in Oracle stock. (He\u2019s also a major shareholder in Tesla.) Unlike Bezos and Zuckerberg, Ellison has long been a major donor to Republicans, and he hosted a fundraiser for Trump in 2020 and dined with him at his Palm Beach club Mar-A-Lago last year. In January, he joined the president to announce a planned $500 billion investment in AI data centers in the U.S. alongside OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman and Japanese billionaire Masayoshi Son. Elon Musk, the world\u2019s richest person and Trump\u2019s right-hand-man at the Department of Government Efficiency, is taking a beating, too. He has lost $8.7 billion, the fifth-most in dollar terms among billionaires, with Tesla shares slumping by more than 5% after a rough week in which the automaker announced its sales dropped by 13% in the first three months of the year. Meanwhile, French luxury tycoon Bernard Arnault, who was the world\u2019s richest person until last year, suffered an $8.6 billion loss as shares in his conglomerate LVMH dipped by nearly 6%. Arnault made a public display of support for Trump in January, attending his inauguration alongside two of his five children, who are all executives at LVMH. Besides Bezos and Zuckerberg, many other tech barons\u2014including Michael Dell, Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang and Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin\u2014also saw steep losses. At least five billionaires have fallen out of the ranks entirely today. The biggest loser in percentage terms has been RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) CEO Gary Friedman, whose net worth has fallen by 37%, to about $730 million. Shares in the upscale furniture firm have plunged by 40%, wiping $435 million from Friedman\u2019s fortune. Other dropoffs made their fortunes in the clothing industry, which could also be hard-hit by tariffs: The U.S. is the largest importer of apparel in the world, sourcing most apparel from Asia, including 21% from China and 18% from Vietnam. It\u2019s no surprise then that husband-and-wife duo Kenneth and Yvonne Lo, the Hong Kong-based cofounders of clothing manufacturer Crystal International Group, also have fallen below the $1 billion mark as shares in the Hong Kong-based firm tumbled by 23%. Crystal, which makes clothes for companies including Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch, Nike, Adidas and Puma, relied on North America for 38% of its revenues in 2024. Brian Hill, the founder of Vancouver-based women's fashion retailer Aritzia, also saw his net worth fall below $1 billion as the firm's stock cratered by 20%. And how is Trump faring amid the market upheaval? Not so bad. The president\u2019s net worth is down by $40 million, to $4.6 billion, as shareholders pushed the price of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., the parent company of his social media outfit Truth Social, down 3%, less than overall market\u2019s decline. Here are the 10 biggest billionaire losers as of the market close:","label":1}

(Photo by Andrew Harnik\/Getty Images) Trump Media shares closed Wednesday at $18.76, with markets closing before Trump detailed the extent of his tariffs. On Thursday, amid a global market selloff resulting from the tariff announcement, the stock dipped to $18.41\u2014down 1.87% from the previous close. Trump owns 114.75 million shares in his media company, meaning his stake dropped by $40.2 million\u2013a sizable decline, but far smaller than the $300 million hit he took after he was found guilty on 34 felony counts for falsifying records in May 2024. Still, Trump fared better than many fellow billionaires Thursday: Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk each lost billions as markets reacted to his sweeping tariff plan. A White House spokesperson directed inquiries to Trump Media and the Trump Organization, neither of which immediately responded to requests for comment. Roughly half of Trump\u2019s estimated net worth comes from his stake in Trump Media, which he holds through a revocable trust of which he is both the sole grantor and sole beneficiary. On Wednesday, Trump announced sweeping tariffs of 10% to 54% on imports from more than 180 countries, releasing a list of tariff targets that included some uninhabited islands. The announcement rattled global markets: the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3.98%, the S&P 500 dropped 4.84% and the Nasdaq Composite index plunged 5.97%. International indexes also tumbled, with the U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 slipping 1.55%, Germany\u2019s DAX off 3.1% and Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 shedding 2.77%. \u201cTHIS WILL BE THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA!,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post about tariffs on Feb. 2. \u201cWILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!). BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.\u201d The White House dismissed concerns about economic fallout from the tariffs, with spokesperson Karoline Leavitt telling NewsNation on Thursday there would be \u201cno pain\u201d for U.S. companies or workers because jobs would return to American soil. How Trump Media investors respond over time to Trump\u2019s tariff push remains to be seen. Despite ending the day down, Trump Media stock actually rose earlier in Thursday\u2019s session\u2014hitting an intraday high of $19.11 around 1:45 p.m. Trump Media accused Axios and the Financial Times of defamation and market manipulation, after each outlet suggested on Wednesday that a new SEC filing may signal Trump was preparing to sell his stake. Trump Media claimed the reports triggered a selloff\u2014though shares ultimately closed up 2% that day, with an intraday low just $0.03 below its opening price. Spokespeople for Axios and the Financial Times did not immediately respond to inquiries. $4.06 billion\u2014that\u2019s Trump Media\u2019s market cap, with Trump\u2019s personal stake accounting for a bit more than half of its valuation. Forbes estimates Trump\u2019s net worth at $5.1 billion. In November 2023, Trump Media sued 20 media outlets, including Forbes, for reporting that included calculations of its financial results while still a private company. The defendants have moved to dismiss the claims.

My firm leverages proven-superior research to deliver you those companies with truly strong fundamentals and undervalued stock prices. This week\u2019s stock pick is featured from my Most Attractive Stocks Model Portfolio. You can find the free pick below along with a concise summary of why I like the stock. Markel Group (MKL: $1,827\/share) has grown revenue and net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) by 12% and 24% compounded annually since 2014, respectively. Markel Group\u2019s NOPAT margin increased from 7% in 2014 to 17% in 2024 while its invested capital turns rose from 0.8 to 1.0 over the same time. Rising NOPAT margins and invested capital turns drive Markel Group\u2019s return on invested capital (ROIC) from 5% in 2014 to 18% in 2024. Markel\u2019s ability to rebound from plummeting bond prices in 2022, and immediately regain profitability in 2023, should give investors more confidence in the company\u2019s ability to navigate the current volatile market. Figure 1: Markel Group\u2019s Revenue and NOPAT Since 2014 MKL Revenue and NOPAT 2014-2024 At its current price of $1,827\/share, MKL has a price-to-economic book value (PEBV) ratio of 0.6. This ratio means the market expects Markel Group\u2019 NOPAT to permanently decline by 40% from 2024 levels. This expectation seems overly pessimistic for a company that has grown NOPAT by 24% compounded annually over the last decade and 15% compounded annually over the last two decades. Even if Markel Group\u2019s NOPAT margin falls to 10% (below 2024 NOPAT margin of 17% and five-year average margin of 11%) and the company\u2019s grows revenue by 4% (below ten-year compound annual growth rate of 12%) compounded annually through 2034, the stock would be worth $2,274\/share today \u2013 a 24% upside. In this scenario, Markel Group\u2019 NOPAT would fall 1% compounded annually through 2034. Should Markel Group grow profits more in line with historical levels, the stock has even more upside. Below are specifics on the adjustments I made based on Robo-Analyst findings in Markel Group\u2019s 10-K: Income Statement: I made over $350 million in adjustments, with a net effect of removing over $200 million in non-operating expense. Balance Sheet: I made just under $1.6 billion in adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net increase of just under $300 million. One of the most notable adjustments was for other comprehensive income. Valuation: I made just under $3.5 billion in adjustments to shareholder value, with a net decrease of over $3.3 billion. The most notable adjustment was for deferred tax liability.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  Jeremy David and Drew Goldstein had no healthcare experience when, in their mid-twenties, they set out to use Palantir's software platform to disrupt hospital operations.          Now, they're working with top health systems like Mount Sinai and HCA Healthcare, competing with dozens of healthcare startups in the AI race.               The $193 billion data giant Palantir is best known for its AI-powered military surveillance software, which it sells to customers like the US Department of Defense, and data analysis tools for finance, which it sells to corporate clients like Morgan Stanley.               But Palantir's healthcare business, which launched around four years ago, is picking up steam. David said the healthcare segment now accounts for about 15% of Palantir's commercial revenue, which reached $702 million in 2024. Palantir said it's helped hospitals save millions of dollars with its tech for healthcare revenue optimization and workforce management and improved patient outcomes with tools for everything from sepsis detection to hospital-at-home care.               David and Goldstein attribute the business's rapid growth to a combination of its robust partnerships \u2014\u00a0Palantir has signed numerous multiyear contracts with health systems such as Cleveland Clinic, Tampa General, and Nebraska Medicine \u2014\u00a0as well as its focus on AI at a time when, as Goldstein put it, \"folks are worried about getting left behind, and starting to question if the partnerships they already had are actually creating any value.\"               Palantir's unfair advantage in healthcare is obvious: the company has a depth of resources and financial backing at its fingertips rarely afforded to healthcare startups, plus the software capabilities to build personalized AI-powered solutions for health systems.               Palantir isn't entirely pushing out other healthcare companies, however. The data company launched a partnership in March with R1 RCM, the revenue cycle management company acquired by TowerBrook and CD&R in a $8.9 billion take-private deal in August. Palantir also launched a program called HealthStart last year to equip healthcare startups with tools like Palantir's developer platform.               \"It's very hard to get access to problems in healthcare because of the monopolistic electronic medical records players and the information security challenges of working with patient health information,\" Goldstein said. \"If we could make it easier for startup teams all over the place to get access to those problems and solve them faster, and democratize that, I think that's valuable for the whole market.\"               Palantir kicked off its healthcare push in 2021, working with Cleveland Clinic and Tampa General, when Goldstein and David were both 25 years old.               They were given a tall task: promise these giant healthcare institutions that, in two months, they would deploy Palantir's software customized for healthcare to drive value.               \"When we've been cast as the people here to fix the hospital, but we show up as two 25-year-olds, it's a hilarious position to be put in because they hate you by default,\" David said.               Goldstein and David, now 29 years old, set out to build software for health systems in three buckets: revenue cycle management, staffing and scheduling, and patient capacity management.               For revenue cycle management, Goldstein and David set out to automate the whole process of how hospitals capture and manage revenue \u2014 from coding to submitting claims to handling insurance denials. They decided to partner with R1 RCM because its business can help manage the whole RCM process on top of Palantir's platform. In contrast, many startups are only able to tackle a subset of revenue cycle tasks, Goldstein said.               On the workforce management side, Palantir began working with Nashville-based HCA Healthcare in 2023 to create medicalprovider schedules with AI, taking into consideration clinicians' preferences and other staffing constraints. Palantir says it's now deployed its customized workforce management software across about 75 of the health system's hospitals for more than 40,000 nurses.               While Palantir's 120-person strong healthcare team has worked exclusively with hospitals to date, David said he and Goldstein have been having more conversations about where Palantir could plug into other parts of the healthcare system, like by helping to manage interactions between payers and providers.               \"If you can automate and improve the interface between the payer and provider, that market is hundreds of billions of dollars, and no one's doing a good job at it,\" David said.               Palantir's entry into healthcare hasn't come without criticism. In 2023, the company won a roughly $415 million seven-year contract with the National Health Service in the United Kingdom to create a unified patient data platform. The contract was met with a public outcry over concerns that the data would be mishandled, in part because of Palantir's work with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which human rights groups argued was used to facilitate family separations and deportations.               Goldstein clarified that a separate team inside Palantir works with the NHS, and noted that he hasn't encountered the same degree of data privacy concerns in the US.               In response to mention of the criticisms, he pointed to Palantir CEO Alex Karp's long history of outspoken support of American innovation \u2014\u00a0and outspoken criticism of Europe's pace of tech development.               \"You can find about a million videos of our CEO talking about why America is a hundred times better of a place to solve problems than Europe right now,\" Goldstein said.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  My position was eliminated in 2006 from a nine-year career as the Chief Information Officer of a mortgage company I helped start. It had been my dream job.          We purchased our dream home the year before \u2014 a four-bedroom corner lot in the suburbs. One daughter was graduating from college, and one had just started college. My parent loan for them was $36,000 for the first two years.               I wasn't worried yet. I had wanted to go into sales in 2003. Now was the time, so, I became a Loan Officer for the same company. I started building my business and was doing well.               Suddenly, you couldn't give money away. I went from closing nine loans a month to zero. The mortgage crash of 2007 to 2009 decimated the economy and my family's life.               I actively networked with local Chambers of Commerce and civic groups. Networking is a key part of starting and building business relationships.               I presented my \"Goal Getting\" Goal Achievement seminars to Boards of Realtors and businesses. I wrote a column about lending for a local Real Estate magazine, attended several chamber events, and led a Chamber networking group.               I made friends with a Coffee News franchise owner and loved the business model. I used my 401(k) to buy a franchise selling advertising to local businesses to start another income stream. I could also use it to advertise my Loan Officer business. As the recession continued, however, restaurants, my main distribution channel, started failing, businesses stopped investing in marketing, and sales plummeted. Now I was getting worried.               I started applying for jobs, and contacting people I knew at mortgage technology companies I had worked with previously. I was offered a position at a vendor I had worked with in my previous role. I loved the company. While negotiating salary, my hiring manager called and said their largest mortgage customer had failed. All hiring was frozen.               Now, I was feeling desperate. The \"B\" word kept me up at night. My parents filed for bankruptcy twice as I was growing up, and I swore I would never do it. I would never put my kids through that. I promised myself.               I found a part-time job as a Bakery Clerk at The Fresh Market near my home for $9.00\/hour. While working as a bakery clerk, I continued building my mortgage business and Coffee News business. My wife, at the time, refused to get a job.               I was trying to make ends meet, but we never did. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches became my breakfast, lunch, and dinner. We used credit cards to buy necessities. Bills were increasing, our limits were reached, and in 2009, we had to file for bankruptcy. I was emotionally devastated.               We lost our home, and our credit score tanked. We moved from our dream home to a 400-square-foot basement apartment on a horse ranch.               I had to call my daughter and tell her I couldn't continue to pay for her college, and we didn't have a house for her to come home to. It was the saddest time of my life as a father. She said she was OK and planned to get an apartment with her friend anyway.               I was feeling depressed, but couldn't give up. I did what I needed to provide for my family. I started studying new skills online: programming languages, new technologies, and social media. I started a blog to share my \"Life on the Ranch.\" I posted my rsum everywhere online. I kept a positive attitude, believing I could reinvent myself and thrive again.               In 2010, I closed my businesses and concentrated on the Fresh Market. I applied for a full-time Bakery Manager position and was accepted, earning $16\/hour. It wasn't much, but I survived the recession and would start building my career again.               Six months later, my networking and rsum posting caught a recruiter's eye, and First Republic Bank in San Francisco hired me.               I packed up our car and took my wife, kicking and screaming, to San Francisco, leaving that chapter behind.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"US President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on goods from countries across the world, on what he called \"Liberation Day\". He says the move will make America wealthy again, but economists warn that prices could rise for Americans and fears of a global trade war have grown. Tariffs are taxes on goods from other countries. Companies bringing the goods into the country pay the amount, typically a percentage of the goods' value, to the government. Trump announced a 10% \"baseline\" tariff on imports to the US. This is what the UK will face. But 60 countries will be hit with higher rates of up to 50%, including Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Bangladesh. Countries in the European Union face a 20% tariff. The tariffs are set to take effect in days. Trump also confirmed previously announced tariffs on specific goods, including 25% on steel, aluminium and foreign-made cars. Read more: Since the 1980s, Trump has strongly argued that the taxes can boost the US economy. He believes they will encourage US consumers to buy more American goods, and increase the amount of tax raised. Trump also wants to reduce the gap between the value of US goods imported and exported. The White House said other countries were taking advantage of the US by imposing their own high tariffs and other trade barriers. \"For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,\" the US president said. However, Trump is taking an enormous risk upon which he is staking his presidency, our North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher writes. If successful, the move could reshape the global economic order. Trump promises that it will rebuild American manufacturing and make the country more self-reliant. But it risks alienating allies and economists warn it could raise prices and threaten a global recession. A messy global trade war looks inevitable, suggests the BBC's economics editor Faisal Islam. Trump's decision to take tariff revenues to a level beyond those seen during the 1930s will mean huge changes to world trade patterns, he says. Read more: Economists say many companies are likely to pass the increased cost of imported goods onto their customers. They could also reduce imports, meaning fewer products are available - putting further pressure on prices. To raise the revenue Trump is hoping for, US consumers are going to have to swallow rises and keep on buying items made in other countries in similar quantities, says the BBC's deputy economics editor Dharshini David. And as she points out, history shows the frontline casualties tend to be consumers, due to reduced choice and higher prices. Cars, lumber used to build houses, beer, whisky and tequila, and avocados are among the goods that could become more expensive. Read more: Global stockmarkets fell and a series of world leaders condemned the measures. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said \"the consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe\". EU countries are finalising a response to the 25% steel and aluminium tariffs and could announce further measures. The commission  has promised to protect European businesses, including Germany's car industry, Italy's luxury goods and France's wine producers. China has promised \"resolute countermeasures\", which are likely to hurt US companies trying to sell into the huge Chinese market. However, Trump's tariffs may also benefit China by allowing President Xi Jinping to portray his country as a champion of free trade, the BBC's China correspondent Stephen McDonell says. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer acknowledged the economy will be hurt by the latest tariffs but promised to react with \"cool and calm heads\". Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told MPs the government would look at how retaliatory tariff measures against US products could affect British firms. Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney said the country will retaliate against US tariffs, \"with purpose and with force\", to protect workers and strength the economy. On Thursday, he announced a 25% levy on all vehicles imported from the US that are not compliant with a current North American free trade deal. Read more: The UK faces a 10% tariff on goods heading to the US but there's lots of uncertainty about what it could mean for the UK itself: Prices could rise \u2013 or fall Once tariffs are in place, the value of the dollar could strengthen. That might push up import costs for UK firms, which could mean higher prices for consumers. But some economists say prices might actually drop at first. That's because firms that usually sell to the US might start sending their goods to countries like the UK instead \u2013 possibly leading to a surge of cheaper goods here. Your job could be affected Higher prices might lead workers to ask for bigger pay rises. If UK companies see their profits squeezed, job cuts could follow.  Interest rates could stay high Rates are currently at 4.5%, and economists had expected two cuts this year. But if inflation rises because of higher prices, rates might stay higher for longer. Read more The chance of the US economy heading into a recession rose to 50% after Trump's announcement, according to former International Monetary Fund chief economist  Ken Rogoff. Trump has previously refused to rule out the possibility of a recession.  There are worries that tariffs could affect US consumer spending - a massive part of the global economy. In Asia, tariffs will \"break the business models of thousands of companies, factories, and possibly entire nations\", says our economics editor Faisal Islam.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Europe's leaders had been preparing for \"Trump's trade war\" - but the reality of a 20% blanket US tariff still came as a shock.  \"This decision is a catastrophe for the economic world,\" said French Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou. \"The consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe,\" said the EU's Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen, who was on a trip to Central Asia. The message from the EU, which has the task of responding on behalf of its 27 member states, is that Europe is ready to negotiate with the US but at the same time poised to hit back too. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic aims to talk tariffs with his US counterparts on Friday. \"We'll act in a calm, carefully phased, unified way, as we calibrate our response, while allowing adequate time for talks,\" he said. For every European country, President Donald Trump's tariffs will be a severe blow, and national governments have been trying to allay the fears of industry and commerce. Italy's Giorgia Meloni \u2013 who until Wednesday seemed more reluctant than others to retaliate in kind against the US \u2013 cleared her diary and hastily summoned ministers and business leaders to an emergency summit. Italy exports \u20ac8bn (\u00a36.7bn) worth of agrifood products and \u20ac2bn worth of wine to the US, Alessandro Apolito of the country's main farmers' organisation Coldiretti told the BBC.  Aside from economic losses, he says there is a risk that US consumers will turn to imitations, capturing market share that would otherwise go to authentic Italian products. In Spain, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez rejected Trump's claim that the EU was imposing 39% tariffs on US goods, insisting in reality it was just 3%.  \"It's just an excuse to punish countries and implement sterile protectionism. The trade war will affect everyone, but it'll hit the one imposing it most of all,\" he warned. The Spanish Chamber of Commerce fears a 14% cut in exports to the US, especially in machinery and electrical equipment. S\u00e1nchez has announced a \u20ac14.1bn response plan to help business with finance and look for new markets beyond the US. Slovakia is more exposed than most EU countries, because of its heavy reliance on industrial exports, and some economists are warning of a deep fall in economic output of at least 2.5% in just two years. Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned of a potential 0.4% fall in its economic output this year. Even before Trump's announcement, the French government had revised down expected growth this year to 0.7%. The French wine and spirits sector in particular is likely to be hit. The head of one of the main wine organisations, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bauer, has warned of a net loss of \u20ac1bn (\u00a3835m) to France's wine industry. Italy's winemakers are holding their breath too. \"We've halted exports for almost two weeks now. Everything is paralysed, because clients aren't placing orders and importers aren't importing,\" says Stefano Leone of Marchesi Antinori, a winery in Tuscany with over six centuries of history. The US accounts for 12 to 13% of total sales, and Leone says the company is in a state of limbo. \"We're waiting to understand what decisions to make, depending also on any countermeasures the European Union may adopt in response to the United States. We're hoping some form of negotiation will take place and lead to a concrete outcome.\" Sentiment across Europe's markets was glum as investors sold shares considered most vulnerable to Trump's tariffs. One of the big German companies, Adidas, saw 12% of its value wiped off the stock market. Small companies as well as large are going to be hit. \"This is the first year we've started exporting to the United States, and the tariffs affect us even more directly,\" says Rocco Mangiaracina, who runs a small family business producing 20,000 bottles of olive oil a year in Sicily. \"Only a week ago, we sent our first 900 bottles to the American market.\" French government spokeswoman Sophie Primas said \"we are ready for this trade war\", but added that \"the [European] Union must be strong, it must be united for this\". Europe's biggest economy, Germany, was quick to call out an \"unprecedented attack on the international trading system, free trade, and global supply chains\". But Germany is still waiting for chancellor-in-waiting Friedrich Merz to form a government, so it was up to acting chancellor Olaf Scholz to point out that the \"world's strongest internal market with 450 million consumers\" gave Europe strength. So how will the EU respond and can it stay united? It has already laid out a measured response. From mid-April, a first package of EU tariffs worth up to \u20ac26bn will be slapped on US goods, in retaliation for 25% US tariffs on EU steel and aluminium exports which were already announced in March. These had been put back to give space for a negotiated solution. If they go ahead they'll cover a wide range of agricultural, food and textile goods. Discussions are currently under way on an even bigger package of countermeasures that are due to come in at the end of April. In von der Leyen's words, Europe \"holds a lot of cards\". Further measures would not just include US goods, but potentially its digital services too. Trump complains about the US trade deficit with the EU, but with services the US has a \u20ac109bn trade surplus with the EU, according to Brussels. If the EU decides to impose tariffs or restrictions on Big Tech services or limiting US access to public contracts, it could use what some have labelled its \"big bazooka\" - more drily known as the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI). That would need majority support from EU member states, but it is a powerful weapon when Europe's businesses are under threat. Peter Dige Thagesen, head of geopolitics at the Danish Industry board, told the BBC that Trump \"threw a hand grenade right into global trade, creating enormous uncertainty\". He said US tariffs would hit smallest companies that exported to the US the hardest. While the EU had to respond proportionately, he said it had to keep negotiating to avoid a deeper trade war. While the majority of European leaders were quick to condemn the US tariffs, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto laid the blame squarely at the EU's feet. Hungary's leader, Viktor Orban, is widely seen as Trump's biggest ally in Europe. \"It has again been proven that in Brussels incompetent people are leading the European institutions, who are also suffering from a very serious Trump-phobia,\" said Szijjarto. Although Norway is not an EU member state, Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said the US decision to impose a 15% tariff was \"bad news\" that would have consequences for many Norwegian companies and jobs. Norway is primarily an exporter and Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg fears it could be hit by a \"triple squeeze\". Not just by Trump tariffs and lower growth, but by the EU's countermeasures too. It could be a trade war with many casualties. Additional reporting by Giulia Tommasi in Rome.

The British firm say no vehicles will be shipped in April as it processes the impact of Donald Trump's tariffs.

Starmer says he will take a \"cool-headed\" approach on tariffs but all options remain on the table.  Copyright 2025 BBC.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Apple supplier TSMC has reached a preliminary agreement with Intel that will see TSMC operating Intel\u2019s chipmaking facilities, reports The Information. TSMC will own a 20 percent stake in the new combined company, while Intel and other semiconductor companies will own the majority of the shares. As part of the deal, TSMC may share some of its chip manufacturing methods with Intel, and train Intel employees to use them. Discussions are still underway, and the final details have not been established. The talks between Intel and TSMC were reportedly initiated by the Trump administration in an effort to stymy Intel\u2019s decline and bring advanced chipmaking to the U.S. Intel is one of TSMC\u2019s major competitors, and the two have long been rivals. Apple previously used Intel chips in its Macs, but transitioned to its own Apple silicon chips manufactured by TSMC starting in 2020. No Apple devices use Intel processors, with Apple now relying entirely on its own technology. TSMC focuses on chip manufacturing, not design, which is handled by TSMC customers like Apple and Nvidia. The focus solely on manufacturing has allowed TSMC to outpace Intel, and Intel\u2019s foundary operations are less attractive to companies because Intel\u2019s chips cost more than TSMC\u2019s and its yields are lower. Some Intel executives are said to be worried that the deal would result in layoffs, because Intel would need to eliminate engineers and may need to change or sell the equipment that it uses. Intel and TSMC have different manufacturing machines and materials, so if Intel is expected to adopt TSMC manufacturing processes, it could have to sell most of its existing equipment. In 2024, Intel had an $18.8 billion loss because of its investments in chip manufacturing and a weakening PC market.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  Amazon and Meta could be big losers from President Donald Trump's new tariffs, ad industry analysts and insiders said.          Trump announced a baseline 10% tariff on products coming from all countries outside the US, but the tax is higher for certain ones. Those include China, which effectively faces a 54% tariff. Tech stocks fell sharply on the news.       Amazon and Meta get a lot of business from Chinese advertisers that are trying to reach American shoppers, and they could pause advertising or lose business.               \"Retail media and digital media will be significantly impacted by these tariffs, especially because products shipped from China and Vietnam are meaningful to Meta and Amazon,\" Brian Wieser, a veteran advertising analyst, wrote in a note.               He estimated around $10 billion of Meta's US revenue comes from advertisers outside of US, mostly from China, and cited research showing China represents half of Amazon's top sellers on its marketplace in the US, which is likely its biggest ad driver.               Eric Haggstrom, director of market intelligence at Advertiser Perceptions, said the most immediate impact would be on quick-turn products like apparel and home goods.               \"The biggest losers you're going to see right now are companies based on Chinese-based advertising: social media and retail media,\" he said.               Ad analysts stressed that tariffs would affect every product category and ad seller because of the global nature of many supply chains. Apple, notably, will likely get hit hard because China is its biggest manufacturing hub. But the situation is so fluid that it's impossible to predict with any certainty at this point.               \"There's no sector that doesn't get hit by this,\" Wieser said.               Others argued that Amazon, Meta, and search ad-driven Google would be resilient because of their scale, measurability, and ability to drive outcomes.               \"The retail media outlets are going to continue to win,\" said Nadja Bellan-White, CEO of M+C Saatchi Group, adding that advertisers' expectations for performance guarantees will be greater than ever. \"They want to know if they spend X amount, they're going to get X result.\"               NewStreet Research analysts wrote that Pinterest, Reddit, and Snap would be the most challenged from an ad standpoint because they have smaller user bases than the likes of Meta. Reddit, for example, has strong user communities but a specific vibe that takes extra work for an advertiser to fit into. Big advertisers could retreat to the platforms they are most familiar with.               The tariffs upheaval comes as the ad industry prepares for its biggest showcase of the year, the television upfronts, when TV giants try to lock in large chunks of ad inventory.               \"Advertisers are still going to want to lock in dollars when they need to run ads tied to product launches,\" Haggstrom said. \"Advertisers want to make sure they are able to place their advertising at the right time. But these negotiations might take longer due to the whole economic and fiscal situation. This is a pretty major shock.\"               Live sports is driving a lot of the TV market because of its big, reliable, and ad-friendly audience, which could benefit players like Disney and NBCUniversal.               Sports is the watchword for advertisers as they worry about political backlash, longtime ad industry player Michael Kassan said.               \"It's the safest place to be,\" he said.               Another view is that advertisers could be hesitant to lock themselves into big TV buy and could shift spending to always-available digital channels.               As for other media and entertainment companies, economic weakness that results from the tariffs could hurt those that rely on consumer spending, Morningstar analysts wrote. Most of those companies also make money from advertising and could see some slowdown there.               Media and entertainment stocks nosedived on the tariffs news.               Disney's parks and experiences generate most of its profit, and a recession would likely depress tourism and reduce attendance in that business. Disney's improving streaming business could make up for weakness in its experiences, though, the Morningstar analysts wrote.               Warner Bros. Discovery also has had recent streaming success that could provide a buffer, but it still has a big debt burden that could make it vulnerable if the credit markets tighten, the analysts wrote.               Netflix doesn't have the Disney-like moat of experiences to protect it, but it has a service that has reached utility-level status. That makes it unlikely that subscribers would cancel in droves, Morningstar analysts wrote.               Bernstein analysts, however, wrote that Netflix's growth abroad could slow if Europe imposes retaliatory tariffs. Netflix is the top streaming video service in the five largest European markets.               The company that remains the biggest wildcard: TikTok.               Some advertisers are embracing its ability to drive outcomes, thanks to steps it's taken to make it easier for marketers to manage and measure ad campaigns, NewStreet Research analysts wrote. However, other advertisers continue to hold back because of its potential for a ban or sale. Adding to the murkiness, its future could be tied to the tariffs, with Trump suggesting he could try to use them as a bargaining chip to get China to allow a sale of the app.       Thanks for signing up for our daily insight on the African economy.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  25 March 2025, Bavaria, Munich: The logo and lettering of global online mail order company Amazon ... More can be seen under the blue sky on the fa\u00e7ade of Amazon Germany's headquarters in Parkstadt Schwabing in Munich (Bavaria) on March 25, 2025. Photo: Matthias Balk\/dpa (Photo by Matthias Balk\/picture alliance via Getty Images)   President Donald Trump\u2019s recent announcement of sweeping tariffs on goods from over 100 countries has sparked concerns about a potential trade war. This could reignite inflation and weigh heavily on the broader U.S. economy and consumer spending. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), in particular, stands to be significantly affected as its online shopping marketplace is heavily dependent on goods sold by third-party merchants in China who supply a significant portion of the goods sold on Amazon. These tariffs could therefore drive up landed costs for a large proportion of Amazon\u2019s inventory. Consequently, a trade war could also reignite inflation and weigh on the broader U.S. economy and consumer spending. Also, see Buy, Sell, Or Hold AVGO Stock At $170 Amid Trump\u2019s Tariffs? Amazon\u2019s stock is not immune to economic downturns and it could face substantial losses. Evidence from 2022 shows that Amazon\u2019s stock value decreased by over 50% within a few quarters. This begs the question: If a downturn similar to the one we saw in 2022 were to materialize, could Amazon\u2019s stock, which was around $240 in February, potentially plummet to below $120? Now, of course, individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio \u2014 and in this environment, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. The concerns raised earlier about the potential impact of tariffs on Amazon are particularly relevant now due to the current economic landscape. While Amazon, like many retailers, has always sourced goods from China and domestic brands with Chinese manufacturing, the present situation presents a larger risk. The recently announced sweeping tariffs, coupled with the increasing possibility of a widespread trade war with key global partners, puts a significant strain on Amazon's global supply chain. This disruption could lead to higher prices for products across its platform, which, in turn, is likely to dampen overall consumer demand. The latest tariff announcement, including a substantial 34% levy on Chinese imports \u2014 a major global manufacturing hub \u2014 further underscores this risk. As these tariffs on Chinese products take effect, the resulting costs will inevitably be absorbed somewhere in the supply chain. This could mean reduced profit margins for Amazon, or ultimately, higher prices passed on to consumers. Furthermore, Trump's recent aggressive trade policies have reignited fears of a resurgence in inflation, which could further erode consumer spending power and negatively impact retailers like Amazon. All of this means the U.S. economy could hit a rough spot, and even worse, hit a recession \u2014 our analysis here on the macro picture. In fact, Goldman Sachs recently revised its forecast, increasing the likelihood of a U.S. recession to 35%, up from its previous estimate of 20%, the Wall Street Journal reported. Given the elevated geopolitical uncertainty, partly fueled by potential policy shifts from the new Trump administration, several critical risks warrant attention. The ongoing war in Ukraine continues to contribute to global instability, and the landscape of international trade remains uncertain. Specifically, the implementation of tariffs can lead to increased import costs, which often translate into higher prices for consumers, reduced disposable income, and ultimately, weaker consumer spending. This presents a significant challenge for companies like Amazon, whose business model is heavily reliant on robust consumer discretionary spending.

Here's how badly Apple has been hit, and where it has been struck globally.\r In February 2025, the Bank of America said that the impact of tariffs on Apple would be significant. Before the extent of the tariffs were announced, Bank of America estimated that they would mean Apple may have to raise iPhone prices by 10%.\rApple has yet to make any announcements about price changes. It might have attempted to swallow small increases in component costs, but it is unlikely to absorb these massive ones. The company has previously made a point of how it has kept the iPhone costs the same for years \u2014  although only in the US.\rThat means it has borne at least some inflation costs mostly because of smart buys of commodities like DRAM and NAND, and also any added expense of new technologies being added to the iPhone. But those costs will continue to rise anyway, and the addition of tariffs may mean even Apple cannot avoid raising its prices.\rPreviously Apple was able to negotiate a tariff exemption during President Trump's first term, but as yet it has failed to do so again. So at present, Apple will have to pay the tariffs on everything it imports into the US.\rAnd, there is some double-dipping involved, perhaps. An iPad assembled in Vietnam will also incur a cost for having a processor manufactured in Taiwan. \rIt should be clear that a TSMC processor made in Arizona would face no tariff, but materials imported to make those chips will be impacted. And, for now, it appears those chips are completed in TSMC's facilities in Taiwan, at least until the AMKOR finishing plant comes completely on line.\rTaking each country's tariffs separately, though, this is what CNBC says Apple now has to pay for devices or components from each of its biggest supply regions.\rChinaChina currently accounts for:\r 80% of Apple's whole production capacity Assembly of 90% of all iPhones Assembly of 55% of Macs Assembly of 80% of iPads Overall, it's estimated that around 40% of all of Apple's suppliers are based in China.

This will affect:\r Assembly of 20% of iPads Assembly of 90% of Apple Watch Other major countriesApple produces some Macs in Thailand, which now has a 36% tariff.

And imports to the US from Taiwan now have a 32% tariff.\rThe impact on Apple, and market sentimentAnalysts are starting to chime in on what they expect to see from these tariffs. Krish Sankar from TD Cowen believes that US sales account for about 31% of total revenues with about 75% coming from hardware products. He estimates that every 10% of tariffs would impact Apple's net income by about 3.5% in FY25 and FY26 EPS. \rHe also estimates that Apple will raise prices to offset tariffs, and estimates that every 10% of tariffs levied can be offset by an about 6% increase in product average selling price. Samik Chatterjee from JP Morgan has also come up with the 6% figure.\rAnalyst Daniel Ives from Wedbush calls the tariff plan \"illogical,\" and \"economic Armageddon\" for the global economy, and specifically, the American consumer. Ives reiterates that when other countries are hit with tariffs, it's ultimately the American consumer that bears the entire brunt of the bill.\rHe still considers Apple a focus to own in a stock portfolio, but is expecting to see at least in the short term a 10% hit.\rTrump's new tariffs immediately caused stocks in technology firms to fall. Apple saw the largest drop of any technology firm. \rApple's stocks fell almost 7.5% in extended trading as of 8 AM Eastern Time on April 3. It's not clear what the market sentiment will be when the market opens.\rIn comparison, Nvidia's shares dropped 4%, while Tesla lost approximately 4.5%. Amazon, Meta, and Google parent company Alphabet all lost between 2.5% and 5%, while Microsoft is down almost 2%.\rUnless Apple stocks rebound during regular trading, this fall is the company's worst since September 2020.

A new report claims that Apple is planning to mark the 20th anniversary of the iPhone with a significant redesign, but perhaps not as dramatically different as it did for the iPhone X in 2007. The British Broadcasting Corporation has complained to a UK antitrust authority that Apple and Google's news services, such as Apple News, diminish its branding by downplaying where it gets its new stories.

President Trump has pushed back TikTok's ban date again, saying that his administration has made \"tremendous progress\" on a deal to \"save TikTok.\" Apple and Michigan State University are opening a free manufacturing training academy in Detroit to help U.S. suppliers modernize their operations. Ming-Chi Kuo's Apple commentary is normally fairly insightful, but his latest batch on how Apple can shoulder President Trump's tariff burden is short-sighted, and doesn't make a great deal  of sense.

With the help of a dumb-looking chart, the president stated there would be a minimum-10-percent tariff on all foreign goods with many of our largest trading partners being taxed at a much higher rate. Obviously, the stock market does not respond well to the threat of a global trade war.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Business Insider Edition  On a drizzly spring morning stroll through New York's Central Park, Max Junestrand, the 25-year-old Swedish founder behind the legal tech startup Legora, opened up about a chip on his shoulder.          He started his company over a year after the founding of Harvey, the OpenAI-backed legal tech startup that has emerged as the apex predator in a fast-growing market for artificial intelligence products for law firms and corporate lawyers. Harvey has enjoyed a close partnership with the ChatGPT maker and secured major law firms as clients.               Now, as Legora bears down on new global markets, Junestrand tells Business Insider his company is gaining ground on chief rival Harvey \u2014 with less money and fewer employees.               \"We're not here to be some European No. 2,\" he said. \"We're here to play.\"               Founded in Stockholm in 2023, the startup helps legal professionals work smarter with a digital workspace built on top of large language models. Its application is used in nearly 20 countries by more than 250 clients, including the global firm Bird & Bird and Mannheimer Swartling, Sweden's largest law firm.               Last week at Legalweek, Legora threw down the gauntlet at Harvey by rolling out new product features, such as a Microsoft Word add-in, aimed at serving global tier-one firms. Legora said it had signed Goodwin, a leading law firm for tech deals, as a client. It also opened a new office in New York City, the company's first outpost outside Europe, where Junestrand will be based.               Not long ago, selling software to law firms looked like a losing business for startups. Lawyers worked mostly out of documents that were hard for software to read. They stored those files on physical servers on location for higher security and control over their data. But over the past few years, as even tech-averse lawyers recognize the clear potential of artificial intelligence, a new class of startups is trying their luck delivering software to the legal industry.               As a teenager, Junestrand competed professionally in video games before learning to code, figuring a career in tech could open more doors than esports. In 2020, he met his future cofounders, Sigge Labor and August Ersus, during a volleyball game during the depths of the pandemic. The roommates shared Junestrand's fascination with machine intelligence and a desire to build.               Labor and Ersus had been toying with software that could complete simpler legal tasks, but the state of large-scale language models at the time limited its usefulness. ChatGPT changed that. \"It just became blatantly apparent that this was a paradigm shift,\" Junestrand said. He left university and the trio started a company, securing a conference room at a Swedish law firm to work from.               An investor shared on LinkedIn that as of last March, Legora had booked nearly $900,000 in annual recurring revenue, or the yearly value of revenue. Legora declined to share a more recent figure.               To date, Legora has raised more than $35 million in funding from investors such as Benchmark, Redpoint, Y Combinator, and Jack Altman's fund, Alt Capital.               Legora's web app looks like a cross between ChatGPT and a chart maker. Its search bar lets users ask questions about the contents of their internal data and browse the web and case law libraries. The app's killer feature is tabular review. It enables the bulk upload of documents and runs software programs called \"agents\" to answer specific questions about the contents of those documents.               Junestrand took BI through a demo as a hypothetical lawyer advising SpaceX on raising an equity round, in which the company's investors want to know about its financial health before deciding whether to write a check.               Junestrand dragged a folder containing dozens of loan agreements into tabular review. File names filled the far left column. In the next column, Junestrand wrote \"loan amount\" and clicked a button that expanded his prompt, telling the agents to extract the loan's value from the contract. He repeated these steps to work out the loan term.               The agents tunneled through the loan agreements at blazingly fast speeds. In seconds, the columns were filled with dollar amounts and dates. Junestrand clicked into a field and an agreement appeared in the right pane, showing the section where the agent had gleaned the answer.               \"Great software has to be intuitive,\" Junestand said. \"Sadly enough, there's a lot of software in the legal space that looks like it was built in the '90s and doesn't prioritize design and ease of use.\"               Though he doesn't name them, it's easy to figure out who he's talking about. Two of the biggest players in legal tech are LexisNexis and Thompson Reuters, which boast decades of experience in creating products for legal professionals.               However, the old legal tech guard has one clear advantage over the challengers. LexisNexis and Thompson Reuters are sitting on troves of copyrighted data that feed their legal assistant products.       Sean Fitzpatrick, the chief executive of LexisNexis North America, UK, and Ireland, spoke at Legalweek about how this data gives it an edge. \"The systems are only as good as the data that sits behind them,\" he said, \"and veracity matters in the law. It matters a lot.\"               Junestand thinks legacy software providers will struggle to keep pace with ChatGPT-era legal tech. He said the technology is moving too rapidly for the incumbents to evolve. He added that he made a conscious decision to keep Legora's engineering team small and nimble, so they can respond quickly to the latest models and AI trends.               As for its battle with Harvey, Junestrand believes the best product will win over lawyers, even if Harvey's ties to OpenAI help boost its brand and credibility.               \"When we started, we were immediately at a disadvantage. We were a year behind,\" Junestrand said, referring to Harvey's headstart on Legora. \"And so pace and speed of execution became the things that we optimized for.\"       Have a tip?

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Graphics within the patent show a device with three hinges and a bendable display.   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Looks like Samsung is taking foldables to the next level; as we wait for its first tri-fold device, aka the Galaxy G-fold, to show up, the company already seems to be working on a quad-fold phone. The Korean OEM recently filed a patent on WIPO's (World Intellectual Property Organization) website showcasing a quad-fold phone, meaning a phone that could fold four times. The patent is titled \"Electronic device including a bendable display\" and was uploaded to the site on 27 March (as first spotted by Sammy Guru).  The listing reveals several graphics of the potential design the phone could carry. It shows multiple angles of the multi-fold device, both folded and unfolded. In the image above, we see four screen panels connected together with multiple hinges, allowing it to fold inward. It looks like the multi-fold will see the same functionality as the \"tri-fold\" phone, only that it will have each panel folding inward instead of just one, as some tri-fold phones have been shown to do. Assuming there's just one display across all hinges, this would give the device a large, tablet-like screen when folded outwards or as a compact phone that they can slide into their pockets when all sides are folded in. While this is still a patent and doesn't mean that these illustrations will turn into usable devices, there may be some solid foundation that Samsung is building on. The tech giant recently showed off prototypes of multi-fold screens at this year's MWC last month\u2014 showcasing its Flex G and Flex S designs; these are foldable panels that look like what its future tri-folding and multi-folding devices would look like. The company also showcased a claw-like foldable that could close vertically, leaving a sliver of screen at the center.  As of now, Huawei's Mate XT has been ruling the tri-fold phone market, although we've heard significant chatter that Samsung is planning to launch its rumored multi-fold phone, reportedly dubbed the \"Galaxy G Fold,\" along with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in July this year \u2014 a Korean news site claims that this phone will go into mass production this month. As Samsung continues to drop hints of its plans to release multi-fold phones in the future, it will be exciting to see how these patents will be conceptualized into devices.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Investors weren\u2019t happy with President Donald Trump\u2019s reciprocal tariffs, sending stocks plunging. The S&P 500 fell 4% at 10:14 a.m., the Nasdaq composite declined 5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 3.7%, or 1,556 points. For the Magnificent 7, declines in pre-market trading were 7.5% for Apple (AAPL),  6.3% for Amazon (AMZN), 4.7% for Meta (META), 6.1% for Tesla (TSLA), 5.7% for Nvidia (NVDA), 2.8% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 3% for Google\u2019s (GOOGL) parent Alphabet. The import taxes will be applied on a country-by-country basis. Chinese goods, for example, will be hit with a 34% levy, while products from the European Union will be slapped with 20% duties. Mexican and Canadian goods won\u2019t face any additional charges. \u201cI don\u2019t think a trade war is particularly good for the stock market,\u201d Melisa Brown,  head of investment decision research at SimCorp (SIM), told Quartz. The tariffs are \u201cnot the death knell for the U.S. economy, but could be very harmful for pockets of it.\u201d Economic data was mixed on Thursday. Initial jobless claims for the week through March 29 unexpectedly declined to 219,000 from un upwardly revised 225,000, but the continuing claims for the seven days to March 22 increased by more than estimated, to 1.90 million. The ISM services purchasing managers index (PMI) ticked down by much more than expected for March to 50.8 from 53.5 in February, with the new orders measure dropping to 50.4. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"SpinLaunch says its network will offer \"significantly higher broadband capacity in a satellite constellation compared with what is available on the market today.\"   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  SpinLaunch has unveiled its plans for a new broadband satellite constellation known as Meridian Space. The Meridian Space constellation will consist of small \"microsatellites\" that can be sent to low-Earth orbit with as many as 250 spacecraft on a single launch vehicle, according to SpinLaunch. The company received $12M in funding from Kongsberg Defense & Aerospace to help develop and commercialize the satellites, with a planned launch date of 2026 for its first on-orbit demonstrator. It's unclear if SpinLaunch will be launching the demonstrator itself with its revolutionary rocket-flinging centrifuge or if it will hitch a ride on another rocket. The Meridian Space constellation will provide \"significantly higher broadband capacity in a satellite constellation compared with what is available on the market today,\" said Eirik Lie, president of Kongsberg Defense & Aerospace, in a statement. David Wrenn, CEO of SpinLaunch, added that NanoAvionics' small, modular satellite platforms offer \"a reliable foundation to scale our constellation quickly and confidently.\" Along with the statement announcing the partnership, SpinLaunch shared an image of a stack of Meridian Space satellites atop a launch vehicle. The flat satellites appear to stack on top of on another, hinting at how the company plans to fit 250 of the spacecraft on a single rocket. If SpinLaunch can successfully loft 250 satellites at once, it would set a new record for spacecraft launched by a single flight. That record currently stands at 143, set by SpaceX's Transporter-1 mission in 2021. Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!  SpinLaunch aims to disrupt the launch services market with its wild new concept for reaching orbit. The company is developing a 108-foot-long (33-meter) spinning arm that accelerates launch vehicles to high speeds inside a centrifuge before flinging them into the sky.  Once at altitude, the flung rockets then ignite their engines. The concept greatly reduces the amount of fuel and hardware needed to reach orbit. NASA signed an agreement with the company in 2022 for a technology demonstration that saw third-party experiments from the agency, Airbus and Cornell University lofted to suborbital space with the centrifuge.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Fans had been waiting months for Nintendo\u2019s big Switch 2 Direct. But one thing that\u2019s dominated the conversation following the showcase isn\u2019t the games or the features, it\u2019s the Switch 2's $450 price tag. Now fans are spamming the YouTube chat for the company\u2019s ongoing Nintendo Treehouse livestream with one simple plea: \u201cDrop the price.\u201d Nintendo Treehouse is a livestream where the company\u2019s employees demo games online, explain what\u2019s new and exciting about them, and occasionally chatting with developers for behind-the-scenes insights. Today\u2019s programming kicked off with a roughly 50 minute deep-dive into Mario Kart World and, later, Donkey Kong Bananza, set to be the Switch 2's big Super Mario Odyssey-style platforming blockbuster for the summer.  Yet with over 70,000 people watching live, all anyone in the chat wanted to talk about was the hardware\u2019s price, and by extension the price hikes on the games, including $80 for Mario Kart World and the Switch 2 version of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. This wasn\u2019t just occasionally, but was ongoing throughout the first hour of the livestream.   Whether the Treehouse Live staff were firing off green shells in Mario Kart\u2019s first open world, or shooting aliens in Metroid Prime 4, the chat remained: \u201cDrop the price,\u201d \u201cdrop the game prices,\u201d \u201cdrop drop drop drop.\u201d Some analysts have suggested the aggressive pricing is an attempt by Nintendo to navigate a complex economic landscape where changing exchange rates and an unhinged, escalating trade war mean the Switch 2 consoles coming into the U.S. could face import taxes of over $150 beginning later this month. Plus, in addition to inflation and other geopolitical factors, Nintendo historically tries to make a profit on each console sale.  \u201cNintendo appears to be building in a buffer against these potential trade barriers while ensuring they maintain their traditional positive margin on hardware,\u201d NYU Stern professor Joost van Dreunen told IGN. \u201cMy view is that they probably had a range of pricing for the US market in play up until the last minute due to the uncertainty on import tariffs.\u201d Nintendo was asked about the price during a Q&A with media yesterday, Game File reports. But Nintendo apparently told the reporter who asked the question that the developers present weren\u2019t able to comment about pricing strategy.  .","label":0}

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  AAPL Stock   Apple stock (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell over 6% in after-hours trading on Wednesday, after President Donald Trump announced a sweeping round of tariffs that would apply to over 100 countries. The iPhone - America\u2019s most iconic gadget - is built almost entirely overseas, exposing Apple to significant cost escalation. The tariffs hit nearly all of Apple\u2019s global production hubs, potentially driving up landed costs for iDevices in the U.S. and squeezing margins. The trade war could also reignite inflation and weigh on the broader U.S. economy and consumer spending. Similarly, see Amazon Stock To $120? How Tariffs Could Reshape Amazon\u2019s Future. Now, here\u2019s the thing: in a downturn, Apple stock could lose considerably. There is evidence from as recently as 2022 that Apple stock lost over 30% of its value in just a few quarters. So, could Apple's $223 stock slide to around $150 levels if a repeat of 2022 were to happen? Now, of course, individual stocks are more volatile than a portfolio - and in this environment, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Why is that relevant now?  Apple has been growing its business steadily via innovative products and a booming services business. There is a larger risk now, given the sweeping tariffs and, the possibility of a widespread trade war with key partners, which puts Apple's global supply chain at risk. The latest tariff announcement includes a 34% levy on Chinese imports, a major manufacturing hub for Apple. While Apple has diversified production in recent years, its other key hubs, Vietnam and India, will face 46% and 26% tariffs, respectively. Granted, Apple pledged $500 billion in investments in the U.S. and intends to hire 20,000 workers in the U.S., but these commitments will take several years to materialize. As Trump's tariffs are imposed on Apple's products, someone will have to bear the costs. It could be Apple (by reducing its margins), customers (who'd pay more for their iDevices), or even wireless carriers, who might share the burden with Apple via higher device subsidies in order to soften the blow for consumers. Either way, if tariffs go through, Apple's sales volumes or bottom line could be impacted. Trump\u2019s bold moves have also stoked fears that inflation could come back. All of this means the U.S. economy could hit a rough spot, and even worse, hit a recession - our analysis here on the macro picture. When you factor in higher geopolitical uncertainty due to bold moves from the new Trump administration, these are critical risks. After all, the Ukraine- Russia war is still ongoing, trade is uncertain. Tariffs drive up import costs and typically result in price hikes, lower disposable income, and weaker consumer spending. This is bad news for Apple, which relies heavily on discretionary spending. Meanwhile, smartphone feature upgrades have become more incremental, and in a shaky economy, people will be more than willing to hold on to their devices for just a bit longer. That could hit Apple even harder. To be sure, AAPL stock is viewed as a safe haven and has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. However, this time around, the company's international supply chain and dependence on foreign manufacturing could prove a liability. Worried about the impact of a market crash on AAPL stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Apple Stock Go In A Market Crash? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes. In summary, it also doesn\u2019t help that Apple's stock is still expensive; it trades at almost 30x consensus FY'25 earnings. To make matters worse, Apple's Revenues have only grown marginally over recent years. Apple has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 2.3% per year over the last 3 years (vs. 9.8% for the S&P 500). Given this growth deceleration and the broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself the question: do you want to hold on to your Apple stock now, will you panic and sell if it starts dropping to $200, $150, or even lower levels? Holding on to a falling stock is never easy.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"ByTrefis Team  ByTrefis Team,  Contributor.  AVGO Stock   Following President Trump\u2019s announcement of extensive tariffs on over 100 countries, Broadcom stock (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock fell by over 6% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. The announced tariffs include a significant 34% levy on imports from China, a major global manufacturing hub. While semiconductor goods are reportedly exempt from these specific tariffs, the broader macroeconomic consequences are a concern. The imposition of tariffs on Chinese products is expected to increase costs within the economy, potentially leading to slower economic growth or even a recession. This economic downturn could, in turn, reduce overall investment in areas like Artificial Intelligence, which could negatively impact Broadcom\u2019s sales and future performance. Separately, see Will Apple Stock Fall To $150 On Tariff Troubles? Notably, AVGO stock looks attractive, given its solid financial performance lately, but it trades at lofty valuations making it a tricky pick at its current price of around $170. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of AVGO stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Broadcom along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AVGO stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. Broadcom\u2019s Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Broadcom\u2019s profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Broadcom's balance sheet looks strong. AVGO stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes.  In summary, Broadcom's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: Broadcom\u2019s strong performance suggests that its stock might be an attractive investment. However, this positive outlook is tempered by the stock\u2019s high valuation. Currently, AVGO is trading at 13 times its trailing revenues and 140 times its trailing earnings. This is notably higher than its average valuation over the past four years, which stood at 14 times sales and 71 times earnings. Consequently, despite its robust performance, the stock appears expensive based on these metrics, leading to the conclusion that AVGO is a potentially tricky stock to buy at its current price. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AVGO stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that?

Vietnam and Japan were hit hard, while Taiwan and Indonesia picked the right day to be closed. Hong Kong, Mainland China, and South Korea were all off, but quite resilient as all markets were down less than -2%. I think it is important to note that both Mainland China and Hong Kong will be closed tomorrow.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"ByGuruFocus  ByGuruFocus,  Contributor.  By Blue Chip Portfolios Shares of Moody\u2019s Corporation (MCO, Financial) have come under selling pressure lately amid concerns of a broader economic slowdown. The stock has been a long-time holding of Warren Buffett and has delivered excellent long-term results for shareholders. Over the past 10 years, Moody's shares have delivered a total return of 412%. Comparably, the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of just 224%. The company is a high-quality business with strong competitive advantages. Moreover, Moody's also has above market growth prospects for the foreseeable future. I believe the stock represents an attractive high quality growth investment opportunity at current levels. Moody's Corp Price Chart Moody's operates two business segments: Moody's Analytics and Moody's Investor Services. The Moody's Analytics segment, which accounts for roughly 47% of total revenue, provides data intelligence and analytical tools to businesses and individuals. The Moody's Investor Services segment, which accounts for the remaining share of company revenue, provides credit ratings, research, and risk analysis. While the revenue contribution from the company's two segments is similar, Moody's Investor Services is a higher margin business with Adjusted Operating Margins of 60.1% compared to 30.7% for Moody's Analytics. Moody's Analytics is primary a recurring revenue business (roughly 95% of revenue is recurring) as the company charges customers for access to data and tools based on a subscription model. Moody's Investor Services is primarily a transaction driven revenue business (roughly 73% of segment revenue) as the key driver of revenue for this segment is fees paid by issuers in exchange for a credit rating. Moody's has been in business for more than 115 years and operates globally. While the U.S. and Europe account for the bulk of the company's revenue, it also has significant operations in Asia. Moody's Corp Revenue by Business Segment Moody's Corp Revenue by Geographic Segment The high-quality nature of Moody's business can be seen in that it generates high returns on invested capital and enjoys a wide moat around its business. The strength of Moody's business begins with its credit ratings business. Moody's along with S&P Global and Fitch dominate the global ratings business. The big three are estimated to have a combined market share of roughly 95% with Moody's and S&P each accounting for an estimated 40% of the market. While Moody's competes with S&P and Fitch, many companies choose to be rated by more than one agency which gives Moody's a strong degree of pricing power despite competition from S&P and Fitch. Evidence for the company's pricing power can be seen in the roughly 60.1% Adjusted Operating Margin enjoyed by its Moody's Investor Services segment. The company's Moody's Analytics segment also enjoys strong competitive advantages due to its unique and vast data sets which allow it to offer unique insights and data solutions for clients. For context, Moody's has more than 556 million economic, financial and demographic time series and has data on more than 525 million public and private entities. Despite this massive amount of data, Moody's continues to enhance its data capabilities and recently announced plans to acquire CAPE Analytics to enhance its property risk analytics capabilities. Moody's significant amount of data on public and private entities is only possible due to the special access to information it enjoys to many entities because of its position as a ratings agencies. In this sense, Moody's two segments work together to enforce the company's overall competitive advantage. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has been a holder of Moody's since it received shares following a spin off from Dun & Bradstreet in 2000. Berkshire's initial position was worth roughly $499 million. Buffett reduced Berkshire's Moody's stake in 2009 and 2010 which proved a rare mistake for the investing legend as the stock has continued to perform quite well. Moody's shares have delivered a total return of 1,870% since the start of 2011 while the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of just 475%. Warren Buffett Moody's Holding Chart Buffett has noted that Moody's is a wonderful business due to its capital light nature, limited competition, and significant pricing power. Currently, Berkshire owns roughly 27.7 million shares of Moody's which is worth roughly $11.7 billion at current prices. Moody's is Berkshire's 7th largest holding accounting for roughly 4.4% of its public equity portfolio. While Buffett has said little about Moody's of late, the fact that he has continued to hold onto the shares will sharply reducing other holdings such as Apple and Bank of America can be viewed as a vote of confidence in the company. Moody's has attractive near-term growth earnings growth prospects due to increasing demand for financial data, a growing credit ratings market due to the proliferation of global debt markets, pricing power due to its strong competitive position, and a reduction in shares due to an expected $1.3 billion worth of share repurchases in 2025. AI has also become a key tailwind for Moody's as it has increased the value of its data offerings in that AI driven solutions require significant data to be useful. Moreover, the company has also started enabling GenAI within a number of its products. Consensus earnings currently call for Moody's to grow EPS at annual rates of 13%, 12.3%, and 11% during FY 2025 \u2013 2027 respectively. I view these estimates as somewhat conservative given the company's near-term growth drivers and guidance for low-to-mid teens EPS growth over the medium-term. Shares of the stock currently trade at 31x consensus FY 2025 EPS. While this represents a premium to the 21x forward earnings that the S&P 500 currently trades at. I believe Moody's valuation premium is well deserved as its near-term growth prospects are stronger than the broader market which has historically delivered high single digit earnings growth. Additionally, near-term growth for the broader market is heavily dependent on the AI theme which I view as significantly less predictable than the factors driving Moody's near-term growth. In addition to trading at a reasonable valuation relative to the broader market, Moody's is also trading at a reasonable valuation relative to its own historical norms. Over the past 10 years, the stock has traded at an average P\/E ratio of 32x. Moreover, Moody's valuation is reasonable compared to its closest peer S&P Global which trades at a forward P\/E ratio of 28x. While S&P Global trades at a slight valuation discount to Moody's it also has modestly lower near-term growth prospects as consensus estimates call for S&P Global to deliver EPS growth of 9.6%, 11.9%, and 11.8% over the next three years. Moody's current valuation also appears reasonable compared to other high quality financial services stocks. Visa, which is expected to grow EPS at annual rates of 12.4%, 12.9% and 12.8% over the next three years, currently trades at 29.5x consensus forward EPS. One risk to consider is that economic conditions deteriorate resulting in challenges for the financial services industry more broadly. As a result, Moody's customers might decide not to invest in new solutions and attempt to reduce spending on Moody's data analytics capabilities. However, such a scenario would take time to have a material impact as customers tend to be locked into longer-term contracts. Perhaps the more significant near-term impact related to an economic slowdown would be a drop in corporate credit bond issuance which could significantly impact Moody's transaction revenues. That said, I do not see such a scenario as highly likely in the near-term as corporations are likely to take advantage of any drop in interest rates related to a macro slowdown to refinance debt at lower interest rates. Moody\u2019s is a company with a track record of delivering excellent results for shareholders. The company benefits from a capital-light business model, limited competition, and a wide moat around it business. The stock has been a longtime holding of Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway and remains one of its largest holdings. While Buffett has not increased this position of late, he has continued to hold while reducing a number of his other top holdings. Moody's has above average near-term growth prospects and trades at a moderate valuation premium to the broader market. I view this premium as appropriate given the strength of Moody's business and solid near-term growth prospects. The stock also trades at a reasonable valuation relative to peers and other high quality financial services companies with similar growth prospects. For these reasons, I view Moody's as an attractive investment at current levels.","label":1}

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski\/Getty Images) Share prices are tumbling around the world in the wake of President Trump\u2019s announcement of higher tariffs on U.S. imports than most countries were expecting, according to The New York Times. What does this mean for the economy and investment? Odds of global stagflation are high as rising prices around the world put pressure on companies to lower their expenses by cutting people. Consumers will spend only on essentials and stocks will likely fall. Investors may benefit from adding investments that do well when stocks don\u2019t \u2013 like gold or options on volatility. Trump\u2019s tariffs are more than five times more than they were in his first term, when levies on foreign goods affected about 1.8% of U.S. GDP. The tariffs announced Wednesday \u201cappear to affect roughly 10.7% of GDP,\u201d the Tax Foundation Federal Tax Policy Vice President Erica York told The Washington Post. Except for goods from Canada and Mexico, Trump leveled tariffs of 10% on all U.S. imports and even higher tariffs on other countries. This included a 34% tax on Chinese imports \u2014 adding to the 20% tariff he recently put on goods from China \u2014 as well as a 20% tariff on European Union imports and a 24% levy on Japanese imports, The Times reported. Trump expressed confidence in America\u2019s future. \u201cWe will supercharge our domestic industrial base,\" he said Wednesday in a White House ceremony. \"We will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers. And, ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers.\u201d Investors around the world sent equity prices down. S&P 500 futures dropped 3.6% and benchmark indices fell \u201cmore than 3 percent in Japan, and nearly 2 percent in Hong Kong and South Korea,\u201d according to The Times. What are economists and market strategists saying? How will Trump\u2019s tariffs affect the global economy? What should investors do? In a nutshell, they strongly disagree with Trump. Prices for most goods and services may rise and the economy will likely slump as businesses reduce capital spending and slash employees to cut costs while consumers buy only what is essential for their survival and shun the rest. Investors ought to resist the urge to sell all their stocks but they may benefit from diversifying into asset categories \u2014 such as gold or a volatility index \u2014 likely to go up as the economy worsens and fear proliferates. Economist and market strategists expressed shock at the magnitude of the tariffs and concern that ongoing uncertainty will reduce growth and slash equity prices. Trump raised the U.S. tariff rate on all imports nearly tenfold from last year to 22% \u2014 a rate not seen since 1910, Olu Sonola, Fitch Ratings head of U.S. Economic Research, told The Times. \"Many countries will likely end up in a recession,\u201d Sonola added. \u201cYou can throw most forecasts out the door.\u201d The tariffs were shockingly higher than expected and \"inexplicable in many ways,\u201d Academy Securities head of macro strategy Peter Tchir told The Times. \u201cI think it\u2019s a disaster.\u201d The market was expecting 10% tariffs \u2014 the announcement of which would have sent stock prices \u201cup quite a bit right now,\u201d Chip Trend Report Chief Technical Strategist Larry Tentarelli told CNBC. \u201cBut because the tariffs came in higher than many expected, I think what that does is it creates more downside volatility right now.\u201d \u201cTrump is going to war with countries on this,\u201d Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income for the National Alliance Securities, said, according to The Times. \u201cIt shows no comprehension as to what he is doing to other countries. And it is going to hurt the U.S.\u201d As growth slows, uncertainty about the next shoe to drop has \u201cparalyzed\u201d investors, consumers and business leaders, head of U.S. macro strategy for MUFG Securities George Goncalves told CNBC. Tariffs have flipped from a \u201cone-time event risk\u201d to an \u201calways-present\u201d one, Mandy Xu, Cboe Global Markets head of derivatives market intelligence, told CNBC. The current expectation in the market is that volatility will persist \u201cgiven ongoing tariff and growth worries,\u201d she added. The global economy is heading for a combination of slower growth and higher prices that could last many years, experts say. Uncertainty about the ultimate price increases resulting from tariffs and the extent of retaliation from other countries could slash growth as the manufacturers paying tariffs raise prices for consumers and businesses that delay capital expenditures, JPMorgan Asset Management APAC Chief Market Strategist Tai Hui said, according to CNBC. The magnitude and timing of the tariffs leaves little room to soften the blow on consumers. \"We\u2019re in for several months of a very significant price shock for the American household sector,\u201d Rosenberg Research President David Rosenberg said, according to CNBC. Tariffs will send stocks into a bear market and cause global stagflation. \u201cExpect retaliation, not negotiation by the EU (targeting U.S. services) and China (focusing on U.S. strategic and business interests),\u201d noted Quantum Strategy Strategist David Roche. \"The Rose Garden tariffs will cement the bear market. They will cause global stagflation as well as U.S. and EU recession,\u201d he said, according to CNBC. Odds of a recession are up significantly. For example, there was a 15% probability of a recession in January and now that risk is 40%, Mark Zandi, Moody\u2019s Analytics chief economist, told the Boston Globe. AMP Head of Investment Strategy and Chief Economist Shane Oliver agrees with Zandi\u2019s 40% recession odds, according to CNBC. With recession odds rising, investors should expect stock prices to slide. This could mean placing bets on gold \u2014 which tends to rise during periods of stagflation and global crisis, noted my April 1 Forbes post. I also expect the CBOE Volatility Index \u2014 the fear gauge which has risen 48% this year, according to Google Finance \u2014 to continue to go up as retaliation from other countries comes into focus and Trump responds with even higher tariffs.","label":1}

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt brushed off concerns about President Donald Trump\u2019s widescale tariffs on foreign imports, claiming in interviews Thursday they would not cause \u201cpain\u201d\u2014even as the stock market plunged and other Trump officials acknowledged there may be short-term consequences for Americans. President Donald Trump speaks during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden at the ... More White House on April 2. Trump imposed tariffs on imports from nearly all foreign nations Wednesday, which has spurred fears of a recession and caused the stock market to take a nosedive, as the tariffs are projected to broadly increase prices for American consumers. Leavitt downplayed concerns in an interview with NewsNation, claiming there\u2019s \u201cnot going to be any pain [from the tariffs] for American-owned companies and American workers\u201d and that Americans can \u201cexpect price stability\u201d and \u201cto buy American\u201d as a result of the tariffs, also claiming \u201cthey can expect their wages to go up.\u201d In a separate interview with CNN, the press secretary deflected questions about the short-term pain Trump\u2019s tariffs will cause as a result of higher prices, saying only that the president is working \u201cevery single day\u201d on easing Americans\u2019 economic pain and is taking a \u201cwhole-of-government\u201d approach to the economy that includes tariffs, getting rid of regulations and cutting taxes. Leavitt\u2019s comments stand in sharp contrast to economic experts who have warned Trump\u2019s tariffs could have a dire impact on the U.S.\u2019 economy, with JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief economist saying Thursday morning the president\u2019s policies will \u201ctake the economy perilously close to slipping into recession.\u201d Her optimism also comes as Vice President JD Vance acknowledged to Fox News on Thursday that any expected economic benefits of Trump\u2019s tariffs won\u2019t be immediate, asking Americans to \u201cappreciate \u2026 that we\u2019re not going to fix things overnight\u201d and saying, \u201cWe\u2019re fighting as quickly as we can to fix what was left to us, but it\u2019s not going to happen immediately.\u201d \u201cTo anyone on Wall Street this morning, I would say, \u2018Trust in President Trump,\u2019\u201d Leavitt told CNN in response to the chaos in the markets Trump\u2019s tariffs have caused. The White House spokesperson said the president is \u201cdoubling down on his proven economic formula from his first term,\u201d and claimed the markets aren\u2019t taking into account \u201cthe massive revenue that these tariffs are going to bring into the United States.\u201d Trump reiterated his support for his tariffs Thursday morning, saying on Truth Social, \u201cTHE OPERATION IS OVER\u201d and \u201cTHE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING.\u201d \u201cTHE PROGNOSIS IS THAT THE PATIENT WILL BE FAR STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER, AND MORE RESILIENT THAN EVER BEFORE,\u201d Trump continued, adding, \u201cMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\u201d In addition to Leavitt and Vance, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also downplayed the tariffs Thursday morning, acknowledging to CBS News that while \u201cforeign goods may become a little more expensive \u2026 domestic goods [will] not.\u201d \u201cSo for the first time in your lives you're gonna actually think about the Americans who make the products,\u201d Lutnick argued. According to the White House, 10% tariffs will take effect on foreign imports at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Saturday morning, while higher tariff rates on many countries\u2019 goods will then take effect on April 9. Tariffs on imported cars and trucks took effect more immediately on Thursday, though automotive parts won\u2019t have tariffs levied until May 3. The tariffs will remain in effect \u201cuntil such a time as President Trump determines that the threat\u201d posed by another country\u2019s trade with the U.S. and taxes on U.S. goods is \u201csatisfied, resolved, or mitigated,\u201d the White House said. Trump announced his widespread reciprocal tariffs on foreign goods Wednesday in an event at the White House, as the president fulfilled a longtime campaign promise to levy tariffs on most imports. The tariffs affect nearly all countries\u2014the tariff list even included uninhabited islands\u2014save for countries that already face high sanctions like Russia and North Korea. Trump has also already imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico and didn\u2019t have any additional taxes levied on them, though imports from China will now face 54% tariffs after Trump added an additional 34% tax on goods from the country on top of tariffs that were already in place. The president has pushed forward with his plan for tariffs even as they\u2019ve been politically unpopular among Americans and widely decried by economists, who have long projected any widespread tariffs would raise the cost of goods and destabilize the economy. Major stock indexes recorded their biggest losses since 2020 on Thursday morning as the stock market plunged in response to the tariffs, with tech stocks like Apple and retail giants like Best Buy, Target and Nike all registering particularly large losses.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"ByDavid Blackmon  ByDavid Blackmon,  Senior Contributor.  TOPSHOT - US President Donald Trump holds a chart as he delivers remarks on reciprocal tariffs ... More during an event in the Rose Garden entitled \"Make America Wealthy Again\" at the White House in Washington, DC, on April 2, 2025. Trump geared up to unveil sweeping new \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in a move that threatens to ignite a devastating global trade war. Key US trading partners including the European Union and Britain said they were preparing their responses to Trump's escalation, as nervous markets fell in Europe and America. (Photo by Brendan SMIALOWSKI \/ AFP) (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI\/AFP via Getty Images) Citing \u201chealthy market fundamentals and the positive market outlook,\" oil ministers representing the member nations of the OPEC+ oil cartel on Thursday announced an agreement to embark on a gradual unwinding of voluntary production cuts which have been in place since 2023. In a release published by OPEC, the eight member OPEC+ countries who have held to those production cuts since November 2023, said a \u201cgradual and flexible\u201d unwinding of the 2.2 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) cuts would happen over an 18-month period starting from April 1. The targeted monthly upward increment in production will be 137,000 bpd. The release further states that those eight countries - Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Kazakhstan, Algeria, and Oman - \u201cwill implement a production adjustment of 411 thousand barrels per day, equivalent to three monthly increments, in May 2025.\u201d That represents a large initial upward move in additional oil on the market that will likely place downward pressure on prices. But the group is careful to emphasize that the \"gradual increases may be paused or reversed subject to evolving market conditions.\" That flexibility is no doubt a crucial factor, especially given that the OPEC+ announcement comes less than 24 hours after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a major wave of new import tariffs on imports from most countries, a move that will have yet-to-be-determined impacts on the global economy. Some economists believe those impacts will be largely negative, meaning that the \u201chealthy market fundamentals\u201d cited by OPEC+ could be about to change, at least temporarily. Concurrently, the UAE is also incrementally raising its production target by 300,000 barrels per day (kbd) over the same period, a decision finalized after delays in 2024. This move reflects a compromise within the group, as the UAE had long sought a higher baseline to reflect its growing capacity. The gradual approach underscores OPEC+\u2019s cautious strategy to support market stability amid uncertain demand forecasts, with flexibility to pause or reverse increases if conditions shift. Other OPEC+ countries like Iraq and Kazakhstan, which have exceeded quotas in recent months, pledged to submit updated compensation schedules by March 17, 2025, extending their adjustments until June 2026. This focus on compliance is critical for OPEC+ cohesion, as overproduction has historically strained group dynamics and undermined price support efforts. Overnight Wednesday, crude oil prices reacted to the Trump tariff announcement in a major way, with both the U.S. domestic WTI price and the international Brent index dropping by roughly 6 percent. At the same time, international stock markets saw a general sell-off in response to the Trump tariffs, with futures on U.S. markets off roughly 3% ahead of Thursday\u2019s opening. As both importing and exporting nations absorb the implications of this combination of OPEC+ unwinding and the array of new U.S. import tariffs, a period of high volatility related to crude prices seems certain to arise. This is unwelcome news for U.S. oil producers, who have seen break-even prices for shale drilling even in the prolific Permian Basin rise above the $60\/bbl level this year. One thing is for sure: If this new combination of OPEC+ unwinding, evolving market factors, and policy shifts results in a long-term, lower oil price situation, President Trump\u2019s stated desire to recreate the \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d boom times of his first presidency will soon be a forgotten slogan.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"The weight of inflation and rising costs are weighing on many Americans, but not all. For the wealthiest households, rising prices are hardly a deterrent; in fact, they\u2019re fueling a spending spree, for now.  According to Moody\u2019s Analytics, Americans earning $250,000 or more annually \u2014 the top 10% of earners \u2014 now account for nearly 50% of all U.S. spending, the highest since 1989. In comparison, spending by middle and lower-income groups has stagnated or even declined. This shift in consumer behavior has placed an unusual burden on the wealthiest Americans to sustain economic growth. Mark Zandi, Moody\u2019s chief economist, pointed out that spending from the top 10% now accounts for nearly a third of the nation\u2019s GDP. The booming stock market and real estate values have played a pivotal role in this surge, he noted, significantly increasing the net worth of high-income earners.  However, this reliance on the wealthiest households is far from stable. Booming stocks and housing markets are inherently volatile. A downturn in either market could trigger a ripple effect, undermining consumer confidence and potentially altering the spending habits of the wealthiest Americans. \u201cThe resulting drama, and in some instances chaos, is creating substantial uncertainty,\u201d Zandi notes. David French, the National Retail Federation\u2019s (NRF) executive vice president of government relations, echoed Zandi\u2019s points, noting that more tariffs would only lead to greater anxiety and uncertainty for both American businesses and consumers.  Another concern is inflation, which remains at 2.8%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2014 still above the Federal Reserve\u2019s target of 2%.  Despite these risks, some investors remain optimistic that President Donald Trump may back down if the economy begins to struggle, creating a \u201cfragile\u201d situation, Zandi said. If a trade war escalates, however, the consequences could severely impact both the economy and asset prices. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

{"date":"2025-04-03","content":"Random Observations for Students of Economics In a previous post, I noted that, other things being equal, trade restrictions strengthen the dollar. A reader asks, why then is the dollar depreciating in the wake of the newly announced Trump tariffs? The answer, I believe, is that other things are not equal. In particular, the policy has reduced investor confidence in the U.S. economy. That's also why the U.S. stock market is declining relative to stock markets abroad. The WSJ explains the dollar depreciation as follows: The dollar\u2019s sharp falls after President Trump\u2019s tariff announcement raises concerns about the risk of a broader confidence crisis, Deutsche Bank\u2019s\u00a0George Saravelos\u00a0says in a note. \u201cDevelopments since the start of the year make us worried about a broader undermining of confidence in the U.S. economic outlook and the medium-term desirability of dollar allocations.\u201d This risks an unwinding of overweight positions in U.S. assets from countries that have exported capital to the U.S. over the past decade.  permanent link    << Home  I am the Robert M.
