Airbus's share price dropped as much as 10% on Monday morning after the planemaker found an issue with some components for its best-selling A320 aircraft. In a statement, Airbus said a \"supplier quality issue\" affected \"a limited number of A320 metal panels.\" Airbus didn't disclose exactly how many planes were potentially affected. \"As it always does when faced with quality issues in its supply chain, Airbus is taking a conservative approach and is inspecting all aircraft potentially impacted \u2014 knowing that only a portion of them will need further action to be taken,\" the statement continued. \"The source of the issue has been identified, contained, and all newly produced panels conform to all requirements.\" Airbus's share price opened at 201.15 euros and fell as low as 183 euros after Reuters first reported on the issue. However, it has pared some of the losses, and the stock was down 6.5% as of 8:10 a.m. ET. The falling share price was likely triggered by market concerns that the issue could cause Airbus to struggle to meet its delivery targets \u2014\u00a0a key metric for financial analysts. Airbus has said it's targeting around 820 plane deliveries this year. Forecast International, a market intelligence firm, has estimated that it will need to deliver over 160 planes in December to meet that figure. The planemaker typically has a big push at the end of the year, delivering 123 last December. However, it would require a record output this month to hit 820 deliveries for 2025. The A320 family accounts for the bulk of Airbus's production and is the most popular plane in commercial aviation. Monday's news follows a software recall affecting some 6,000 Airbus A320 jets over the weekend. European regulators issued an emergency directive after it was found that intense solar radiation could corrupt data that is critical for flight controls. After some concerns that this could disrupt travel over the Thanksgiving holiday, many airlines were able to update their software overnight, which minimized the impact. Jump to","label":1}

Nvidia has made a $2 billion investment in semiconductor software design firm Synopsys, adding to the chipmaker's large web of AI-related investments. Nvidia said on Monday that it had purchased $2 billion of Synopsys common stock as part of a partnership to accelerate the development of AI for design and engineering applications. The partnership will combine Nvidia's AI expertise with Synopsys' engineering applications to power a range of compute-intensive jobs, including chip design. The companies said they would also work on building \"digital twins\" \u2014 virtual replicas of physical objects \u2014 to design and test ideas in areas such as robotics and aerospace. Synopsys' stock climbed as much as nearly 7% in early Monday trading, before paring its gains.   \"Our partnership with Synopsys harnesses the power of NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI to reimagine engineering and design \u2014 empowering engineers to invent the extraordinary products that will shape our future,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a release. Nvidia said it invested in Synopsys at a purchase price of $414.79 per share. Nvidia has long been a prolific investor in other companies, but it has ramped up its spending in recent months with investments in ElevenLabs and Nscale. In September, Nvidia said it plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI to support the build-out of AI data centers. Earlier that month, Nvidia also made a $5 billion bet on Intel. The expanding web of investments, which has included some circular financing, has raised bubble concerns among market watchers. Jump to","label":1}

Michael Burry is taking on a who's who of the world's biggest tech giants \u2014 and now he's picking a fight with Elon Musk. The investor of \"The Big Short\" fame called Tesla \"ridiculously overvalued\" in a post on his Substack released late Sunday evening, after previously disclosing bets against Nvidia and Palantir. \"Tesla's market capitalization is ridiculously overvalued today and has been for a good long time,\" Burry wrote, adding that he expects Musk's $1 trillion dollar pay package to continue to dilute the company's shares. \"As an aside, the Elon cult was all-in on electric cars until competition showed up, then all-in on autonomous driving until competition showed up, and now is all-in on robots \u2014 until competition shows up,\" the legendary investor said. It's not the first time Burry has taken aim at Tesla. The investor placed a bet against $530 million worth of Tesla shares in 2021 but exited the position a few months later, with Burry telling CNBC the move was \"just a trade.\" Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Burry's post. Musk's EV maker is the latest tech giant to draw the investor's fire. Burry, whose bet against the housing market in 2008 was famously depicted in \"The Big Short\" movie, has been outspoken in his belief that the current AI boom is a bubble. Last month, he disclosed bets against Nvidia and Palantir and engaged in a war of words with both companies. In a pivot, he deregistered his hedge fund in November and set up his Substack last week. Burry is not the first to call Tesla overvalued. The company's shares trade at over 250 times its earnings, far higher than other carmakers, and fellow famed short-seller Jim Chanos also said in 2023 that Tesla was overvalued. Despite a DOGE-related wobble at the start of the year, Tesla's shares are up 11% in 2025 as investors have cheered the company's robotaxi rollout. Musk has hit out against Tesla's critics and short sellers, predicting that the EV maker will become the most valuable company on the planet. The billionaire's $1 trillion pay package, which was approved by Tesla shareholders last month, is contingent on the company's market cap rising over the next decade to $8.5 trillion, nearly double the valuation of Nvidia. The Cybertruck maker continues to dominate the EV market in the US, with around 41% market share as of August \u2014 but that number has fallen in recent years as competitors have rolled out more electric models. Musk has said that Tesla's robotaxi and Optimus robot are the future of the company. But Tesla faces fierce competition there too, from companies like Google-backed Waymo and Chinese robotics startup Unitree. Jump to","label":0}

The secondhand fashion and luxury market is growing three times as fast as the firsthand market, and it is expected to reach as much as $360 billion by 2030, according to an October report from Boston Consulting Group and pre-owned fashion marketplace Vestiaire Collective. Items bought secondhand accounted for 28% of the total closets of the nearly 8,000 people surveyed and 40% of their handbags. Revenue at luxury secondhand retailers like Fashionphile and The RealReal is up in the double-digit percentages so far this year. There are a few reasons for the secondhand surge: Affordability \u2014 in contrast to the price hikes from many luxury brands \u2014 has attracted buyers in an uncertain market, the proliferation of resale platforms has increased accessibility, and increased guardrails around authenticity have made shoppers more confident. \"It's becoming something that's much more sustainable and part of the way people engage in the category,\" Pierre Dupreelle, a managing director at BCG and one of the report's authors, told Business Insider of luxury shoppers. For every secondhand buyer, there is a seller \u2014 and people are cashing in on the trend. People now shop with ROI in mind. Online thrift store ThredUp found in a 2025 survey that 47% of consumers consider the resale value of clothing before making a purchase; among those aged 18 to 44, that number ballooned to 64%. \"You own a piece of capital that you can apply to something else; it's money in your closet, sitting and waiting to be spent,\" Lara Osborn, the SVP of merchandising and fulfillment at Fashionphile, told Business Insider. But buyers who want to be sellers, beware: Like with stocks, investing in luxury is not a sure thing. So if you are going to shell out for a Herm\u00e8s Birkin or Rolex, make sure you actually like it. A good rule of thumb is to consider it a shopping victory \"when you can buy, use, and enjoy it, and sell it at some point and get a big portion of your money back,\" Osborn said. Business Insider has spoken with experts at luxury resale platforms like Fashionphile, The RealReal, and Bob's Watches about which items hold their value the best, and what can be resold for more than its list price.

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"Oleksandr Usyk (left) has won all 24 pro bouts and Wilder has won 44, lost four and drawn one  Unified heavyweight world champion Oleksandr Usyk has named Deontay Wilder as the \"first option\" for his next fight. The Ukrainian stopped Londoner Daniel Dubois at Wembley Stadium in July to become a two-time undisputed heavyweight champion. Usyk, 38, then vacated his WBO belt, with Britain's Fabio Wardley upgraded from 'interim' to full champion. \"I continue fighting next year. I want to fight Deontay Wilder. I think it's interesting,\" he told Boxing King Media. Wilder, a former WBC world champion and once the division's most feared puncher, has struggled since his trilogy with Tyson Fury. The American's stock plummeted after back-to-back stoppage defeats by Joseph Parker in 2023 and Zhilei Zhang in 2024. After more than a year out, Wilder, 40, returned in June with a low-key seventh-round stoppage of little-known Tyrrell Anthony Herndon. Despite that decline, Usyk still views 'The Bronze Bomber' as a marquee name. \"He is a world champion guy. A very famous and strong guy,\" Usyk said. \"One of the great heavyweights of the last 10 years. I spoke with my team and said he is the first option.\" What next for heavyweight division after TKV win? TKV stuns Clarke to win British heavyweight title Usyk chose to vacate his WBO title rather than face mandatory challenger Wardley. He may still be able to fit in a voluntary defence with Wilder if an opponent is agreed quickly, with several mandatory challengers with other organisations already tied up. WBC 'interim' champion Agit Kabayel meets Damian Knyba on 10 January, while the IBF has ordered Richard Torrez Jr to face Frank Sanchez in a final eliminator. WBA 'regular' champion Kubrat Pulev is scheduled to fight Murat Gassiev on 12 December. Usyk - who has twice beaten Fury, Dubois and Anthony Joshua - has previously said he plans to fight for only two more years, aiming to return to the ring in 2026. The Olympic gold medalist became undisputed champion at cruiserweight before moving up to heavyweight, where he outpointed Fury to become boxing's first undisputed champion in 25 years.

Packman is a classic, and it will always be cool. Cabinet arcade games have mostly been replaced by digital ones now, but if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking to bring a piece of the 90s filled with nostalgia to your home, LEGO is offering a great way to do it, that too without shelling out big bucks. Right now, you can grab the LEGO Icons PAC-Man arcade building set for $189, after Black Friday slashed 30% off its usual, not-so-friendly $270 tag. Fair warning: It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not one of those tiny sets. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be building both the insides that help you understand the mechanism, plus the exterior, which looks incredibly close to the real arcade cabinet. This is also its lowest price ever, and since Black Friday wrapped up yesterday, this lingering deal won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be around for long either. Get yours in before that happens. See at Amazon It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not going to be one of those quick projects that only take a few hours. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting a total of 2,651 pieces, which translates into a whole weekend of fun. The attention to detail is impressive; you will be recreating the 1980s maze-chase video game with all its original design details. These include a 4-way joystick that used to unleash chaos back in the day, plus an illuminating coin slot to get the fun started. The mechanical handle on the side turns, while the game score display is adjustable. The back unveils the mysterious interior, which gives you an idea of the maze-chase mechanism. The included Pac-Man, Blinky, and Clyde figures go at the top of the cabinet, and you can press them to rotate. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mini version of the arcade scene, too, with a minifigure trying his luck! It makes an iconic display for any room. Place it on your bookshelf, in your living room, or add some personality to your office with it. You can also place the minifigure with his tiny arcade inside the main piece by opening the back panel. The set may look intimidating at first, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really not. It comes with an instruction book that takes you through each step one by one. The book is quite easy to follow, but for more assistance, you can also install the LEGO Builder app. This platform offers 3D instructions for all your sets, where you can even zoom in on the blocks from each angle to understand the construction better. You can track your progress, save all your sets in a single place, and even build with friends. When building it with others, it divides the steps between everyone, letting everyone access their tasks on their own devices. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a fan of retro games, this build offers an excellent chance to bring an iconic set home. You can also gift it to a loved one who shares the same passion! If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting it for yourself, build it during the holiday with your family for some fun, bonding time. The current deal is letting you grab it for $189, after a nice $81 discount. It won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be around forever, since Black Friday is now behind us, and Cyber Monday is the day.

Sonos is known for making high-end WiFi speakers that are meant for home audio systems but the Era 100 adds Bluetooth connectivity and real portability to the company\u2019s signature sound quality. This speaker has better sound quality than any other portable Bluetooth speaker and it combines the convenience of wireless pairing with the ability to play music in multiple rooms. Right now, the Era 100 is now $169 instead of its usual $199 price for Cyber Monday which is the lowest price this model has ever been since it came out. You only have a few hours left to get this deal, which is basically studio-quality audio in a size that makes it easy to move between rooms. See at Amazon The new processor is 47% faster than the old Era design and when used with more Sonos speakers, it can handle more complicated audio processing and keep everything in sync better. This processing power makes the dual-tweeter acoustic architecture work which lets a single small unit create real stereo separation by putting instruments and vocals in different places in space instead of mixing them all together into mono mush. The tweeters make high frequencies sound clear which lets you hear cymbals shimmer and voices breathe, which cheaper speakers hide. The midwoofer is 25% bigger than the last generation which makes the bass sound deeper and this combination gives you full-range sound that doesn\u2019t need a separate subwoofer for casual listening. However, if you want room-shaking low end, you can still get it. The Sonos app uses Trueplay tuning technology to look at the acoustics of your room and automatically changes the speaker\u2019s EQ to make up for reflective surfaces, furniture placement, and room size. This adaptive processing stops the bass from getting too loud near walls and the sound from getting too thin in rooms with high ceilings and few soft furnishings. The small size means it can fit on bookshelves, kitchen counters, nightstands and desk corners without taking up too much space or needing its own furniture. The Era 100 is a good size for smaller rooms where bigger speakers would be too much. It also encourages people to try out different placements because it only takes a few seconds to move it instead of needing help. A single button press turns on Bluetooth pairing which lets you connect to phones, tablets, and laptops right away when WiFi isn\u2019t available or isn\u2019t convenient. This means that the Era 100 is great for outdoor parties on patios or balconies where your home network might not work well. It also lets guests play music from their devices without having to join your WiFi network or download the Sonos app. Setting up takes just a few minutes and is very easy: All you have to do is plug it in and connect your phone to the same WiFi network. The Sonos app tells you where to put your speakers and how to calibrate Trueplay without using technical language or menus that are hard to understand. With Alexa integration, you can control playback, change the volume, and skip tracks without having to touch anything. At this price of $169, Sonos sound quality is on par with that of mid-range Bluetooth\/WiFi speakers that don\u2019t have multi-room capabilities and have worse audio processing. The Cyber Monday sale ends tonight, so this is your last chance to get the Era 100 at the lowest price ever before it goes back to regular price tomorrow.

But, fear not, because those five awesome deals are very much still live for Cyber Monday. Your second chance at bringing home some of the best floor cleaning tech at great prices is live right now, with savings up to 33% on Eureka\u2019s best robot, upright, and stick vacuums. Was: $450 Now: $300 (save 33%) This one is for the remaining robot-vacuum skeptics who are curious about all the hype but not willing to drop a pile of money to check it out. The E20 Plus is the souped-up successor to Eureka\u2019s first entrant into the robot vacuum market, the E10s. That debut model from 2023 sold like crazy, and there are over 100,000 E10s worldwide happily chugging away as we speak. The E20 Plus doubles down on the success of the E10s, but not its price \u00e2\u0080\u0094 this Cyber Monday deal brings it down by 33% to just $300. The 8,000Pa of suction is a big leap forward from the E10s, making it an even more effective machine for effortless dust, crumbs, pet hair, and other debris. It\u2019s also a high-functioning robotic mop that cleans your hard-surfaced floors and then spares your carpets from the dirty, wet mop heads by automatically lifting them by 10mm before switching to vacuum mode. As a vacuum, the 8,000Pa of suction is just one of the E20 Plus\u2019s outstanding features. Its charging base is bagless and self-emptying for less maintenance, DuoDetect AI 3D Obstacle Avoidance allows it to intelligently identify and avoid hazards, it\u2019s enhanced with low-light vision for night cleaning or cleaning beneath lifted furniture. Plus, the newly upgraded anti-tangle V-shaped roller is a must for pet owners. This 33% off deal on the E20 Plus might be Eureka\u2019s best Cyber Monday deal of all, especially if you\u2019re still on the fence about entrusting your floors to an autonomous cleaning machine. See Eureka E20 Plus at Amazon Was: $700 Now: $490 (save 30%) The E20 Plus might be for the robot-vac newbie, but the J15 Ultra is definitely for anyone looking for an upgrade at an incredible price. Eureka\u2019s flagship robotic beast brings a staggering 19,000Pa of suction power, advanced mopping ability, and pro-level AI-powered navigation to the table for a Cyber Monday steal at just $490. Make no mistake, the J15 Ultra is a standout robot vacuum that will have your carpets cleaner than ever. But the mopping features are otherworldly, especially Eureka\u2019s new ScrubExtend technology that renders baseboards, corners, table legs, and other challenges moot. The 98.95% cleaning coverage in those tight spaces is among the very best on the market, and the J15 Ultra adds to the package with a base station that washes the mop heads with hot water and then dries them with hot air so they\u2019re ready to go again far more quickly, while sparing you the odors of damp and dirty mop heads. The vacuum tech was definitely not ignored when Eureka created the E20 Plus. They\u2019ve added AI-powered IntelliView navigation with advanced vision sensors and LiDAR to comprehensively map your home\u2019s layout in 3D and chart the most efficient course, and also recognize and intelligently learn how to dodge over 150 kind of obstacles. We\u2019re also hugely impressed by the \u201cwhy has nobody thought of this before\u201d common-sense hair-tangle solution Eureka has devised with its new FlexiRazor feature \u00e2\u0080\u0094 sharp blades that proactively slice through hair tangles that would otherwise snare the unit\u2019s rollers. Robot vac upgrades seldom come with this much cleaning firepower, and finding one at the Cyber Monday price of just $490 that Eureka is offering the J15 Ultra for is even more rare. See Eureka J15 Ultra at Amazon Was: $180 Now: $144 (save 20%) The FlexReach Plus might resemble a traditional manual upright vacuum, but there\u2019s little in the way of traditional upright vacuum traits to it. For starters, it\u2019s far lighter and easier to push, far more maneuverable, and especially with the 20% Cyber Monday deal in place, far easier on your wallet at a mere $144. A detachable canister pod, nearly 10-foot hose with a wide array of attachments, and extra-long 30-foot power cord leave nowhere for dirt or dust to hide from the FlexReach Plus. Stairs, upholstery, corners, and ceilings are all well within reach of the FlexReach Plus and its formidable 192AW of suction. The detachable pod is also an incredibly effective containment unit thanks to Eureka\u2019s Complete Seal technology and HEPA filter, which keeps even minute particles trapped inside the unit and away from the air you breathe until it\u2019s time to use the one-touch release system to empty the canister. If you still associate upright vacuums with drudgery and hard manual labor that still leaves stairs and surfaces untouched, now\u2019s the time to acquaint yourself with what an upright vacuum really can accomplish in 2025. The Eureka FlexReach Plus is a Cyber Monday deal well worth exploring at just $144. See Eureka FlexReach Plus at Amazon Was: $180 Now: $145 (save 19%) Stick vacuums have all too often fallen into the \u201cget what you pay for\u201d category, known for modest performance and lifespan to match their modest price tags. That thinking goes out the window with Eureka\u2019s ReactiSense 451, which could be the smartest stick vac on the market thanks to its ability to detect different types of flooring and debris and intelligently adjust its speed and suction accordingly. Somehow it manages to do this and much more for just $145 for Cyber Monday. When suction power that can reach 25,800Pa isn\u2019t at the top of a stick vacuum\u2019s features list, you know it\u2019s got a lot going for it. Complete Seal tech and a HEPA filter perform all the debris containment you need, even on tiny pollutants like pollen and pet dander, and the LED screen at the top of the unit doubles as a top-notch control board and status update report for battery life and filter status. Even in the company of robotic powerhouses and advanced uprights, the ReactiSense 451 might just be Eureka\u2019s best deal for Cyber Monday, if not all of 2025. It\u2019s an incredible value at just $145 until this deal ends. See Eureka ReactiSense 451 at Amazon Was: $130 Now: $100 Bang for your buck fans, apartment or small house dwellers, and any fan of exceptional tech that far outperforms its price tag will not want to miss this deal twice. Eureka\u2019s ReactiClean 410 is likely the best $100 vacuum available anywhere on Cyber Monday. The same groundbreaking Sense & React technology you find in the ReactiSense 451 is also in the ReactiClean 410, along with the same Complete Seal canister, HEPA filter, and 20,000-plus-Pa suction power. It\u2019s practically a Transformer with its easily manipulated 4-in-1 system that allows you to use it to clean your car just as easily as your couch. The ReactiClean 410\u2019s rechargeable battery is detachable, and with a full charge gives you enough runtime to clean up to 1,614 square feet before going back for a fast recharging. Overperformance on a modest price tag is what the ReactiClean 410 is all about, so don\u2019t miss your last chance to grab it for just $100 on Cyber Monday.

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"Aston Villa are going for a fourth successive Premier League victory when they travel to Brighton on Wednesday, but should Unai Emery's side change the way they have been scoring goals on their winning run? \"There is apparently some debate about whether Villa's xG (expected goals) is unsustainable because they are scoring from long range, but that's nonsense,\" said BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton. \"Villa have good players who can shoot from the edge of the box, so are you seriously going to tell them not to shoot now, because of xG? Give me a break.\" Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League games this season, against AI, BBC Sport readers and a variety of guests. For the midweek fixtures in week 14, he takes on musician, author and Fulham fan Felix White. White is the guitarist with The Maccabees and 86TVs. His new book 'Whatever will be, will be: A Matter of Life and Football' is out now. Do you agree with their scores? You can make your own predictions below. The most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page. A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points. White co-presents the BBC cricket podcast, Tailenders, and the official Fulham podcast, Fulham Fix White's book follows his journey through the 2024-25 FA Cup campaign from the extra-preliminary round to the final at Wembley. \"It started accidentally when I was on tour with 86TVs, at Kendal Calling in the Lake District,\" White told BBC Sport.  \"I was having a weird day and, probably like many people reading this, when I am feeling like that I quite often go and find football or cricket. I find watching it just airbrushes me, and just changes my way of thinking about the world. \"I saw Penrith were playing down the road and we weren't on stage until after 6pm, so I worked out I'd just have enough time to get back afterwards. I watched the game in their ground surrounded by hills, and it gave me a sensation almost like I was watching football for the very first time. \"Anyway, I realised at the end that I couldn't get a taxi back to the festival so I had a bit of a panic, and I ended up getting a lift with a guy called Billy Williams, who turned out to be the chairman of Penrith. \"When I was in the car with him, all these stories came flooding out and it made me think that from a literary perspective, the FA Cup is quite a profound kind of framework. \"Because of what it means to people, I realised this was an adventure where I could write a book telling a story not just about English football, but about England itself.\" Chris Sutton and Felix White were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.  The AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this week's Premier League scores'. Vitality Stadium, 19:30 GMT This is a difficult one to start off with. Both teams suffered bad defeats at the weekend for different reasons. Bournemouth let a two-goal lead slip as they went down 3-2 at Sunderland and have now lost three of their past four games. At 2-2, Evanilson had a goal disallowed for offside when he tapped in a deflected cross which looked like it was heading in anyway. I was trying to think back to whether I'd have done the same thing as a striker and, yes, I would. Single-mindedness is what I'd call it. Everton have surely got to defend better than they did in their 4-1 defeat by Newcastle. I just didn't expect to see them capitulate like that. Bournemouth have started leaking a few goals recently too, so maybe there is some hope for one of Everton's less-than-prolific strikers to finally find the net - but I actually think this will be quite tight and the Cherries will edge it. Sutton's prediction: 2-1 Felix's prediction: These two sides are going to level out and end up quite close to each other in the table by the end of the season, in eighth or ninth or something like that. I feel like they will closely matched on Tuesday, too. 1-1 AI's prediction: 2-1 Craven Cottage, 19:30 I am at this game for 5 Live. We had my predictions opponent Felix on the FPL Podcast last week and I know he will go for a Fulham win here - I really like him, and I enjoy listening to Tailenders, but I'm sorry to say he's going to get this prediction wrong. Fulham's home form this season probably gives Felix some hope but their record against City is absolutely awful. City have won their past 18 meetings in all competitions since 2012, which is the longest winning run by a team against any opponent in the entire history of English football, scoring 54 goals and conceding only seven. I covered City against Leeds on Saturday and they got lucky, while away from home they have lost three times already.  With the run they are on against Fulham, however, there is no way they won't win this game. Sutton's prediction: 0-2 Felix's prediction: This is the only game I am going to call totally from my heart and not my head. We have beaten a lot of big teams recently, but we haven't beaten City for a long time, especially at the Cottage. That changes here, and in exactly the same way that we beat Liverpool in April.  So, City are going to go 1-0 up then we will score three. They will nick one back and then there will be 10 minutes of manic defending, but we will hold on. 3-2 Felix on Fulham: It's been such a weird season because the table is so tight at the moment that one bad result makes everyone worry about relegation, and a couple of good ones, like we've just had, makes you think 'oh we're only five points from being fifth'. AI's prediction: 1-3 St James' Park, 20:15 Tottenham boss Thomas Frank needs a result. He was so relaxed when he was at Brentford but now he just looks like a guy under pressure. Frank saying the supporters who booed Guglielmo Vicario after his mistake against Fulham \"can't be true Tottenham fans\" underlines the friction he is feeling at the moment, but he does have a point about the effect that has. As a player who has been booed a lot over the years, I can tell you that it doesn't have a positive impact on your performance. Being serious, though, I just don't get it - it just creates negativity. The Spurs players will probably be relieved to be playing away after that, but Newcastle have found a bit of form in the past week so this is not an easy trip at all. Tottenham have already lost at St James' Park this season in the Carabao Cup, and I am going for a repeat result, by the same scoreline. Sutton's prediction: 2-0 Felix's prediction: It feels like Newcastle are just starting to go through the gears. In contrast, with the amount of games Spurs have got and the form they are in, they are going to be struggling. 3-0 AI's prediction: 2-0 Emirates Stadium, 19:30 Chelsea were down to 10 men for an hour on Sunday so I was a little bit surprised Arsenal did not go for it more. There has been legitimate criticism of Gunners boss Mikel Arteta in the past about him being too negative, and I don't think they went for the jugular at Stamford Bridge. If it was 11 versus 11 then a 1-1 draw there is not a bad result at all, because Chelsea are a good team, but are Arsenal making the most of these opportunities? I am not sure. Still, I think they will bounce back and beat Brentford, and I can see them getting a few goals this time. We know the Bees will sit in and try to hit them on the counter with balls in behind for Igor Thiago, but I don't think it will work. Sutton's prediction: 3-0 Felix's prediction: Arsenal are going to win this, aren't they? They just look so professional and so solid.  They are going to be absolutely cruising in the title race until February or March and then if Manchester City or Chelsea, or whoever it is, are within five or six points then they might feel the pressure. I can see them losing a game or two then, but only if anyone is still close to them.  For now, though, I don't see anyone beating them. 2-0 AI's prediction: 2-0 Amex Stadium, 19:30 Villa are playing well right now but this is a tough trip for them and with their heavy schedule it might be a game too far.  Brighton are in great form too, especially at home. Their boss Fabian Hurzeler has done a great job there. The Seagulls have got plenty of firepower and a strong squad so, on that basis, I am going to back them. Sutton's prediction: 2-1 Felix's prediction: Brighton are in really good form. Villa are too, but I think the games might catch up with them here. 2-1 AI's prediction: 1-2 Turf Moor, 19:30 Manchester United did not have to play particularly well to beat Crystal Palace on Sunday, and Eagles boss Oliver Glasner moaned afterwards about the club's failure to bring players in over the summer. When a manager does that, I start to wonder how long he will hang around. I get it - you have to leave when your stock is high, and Glasner's certainly is at the moment. He is right, though, because their squad is stretched. Glasner must have been listening to the Monday Night Club because I've been saying the same thing since the start of the season, about how they are going to come a cropper because it is very difficult to compete without that depth. I still think Palace will win this game though, because Burnley are in a bit of bother. Scott Parker's side don't score enough goals so it was real blow for them to get level at Brentford with five minutes to go on Saturday and still get nothing from the game. I have a feeling they will battle away here too, and then see Palace sneak it late on. Sutton's prediction: 0-1 Felix's prediction: Palace also have played loads of games and I had a feeling they would struggle against Manchester United before they lost on Sunday. I still think they will win this one though. It feels like Burnley ship goals at the end of games, because they don't quite last the pace. 1-3 Felix on being at Wembley when Palace won last season's FA Cup: I had so many mad journeys and adventures in the book, and it almost became about finding the game that had the story behind it that had nothing to do with football, but was about the people I met or even me personally.  But I do have to say that being among the Palace fans at Wembley was honestly the closest thing I've seen to an actual religious experience.  The sense that they were doing something by winning their first major trophy that their parents or grandparents who supported Palace couldn't see, was incredible. It captured the very essence of the book because I was looking for the magic of the FA Cup and I found it right there. Even talking about it now, I still get shivers. AI's prediction: 1-1 Molineux, 19:30 Wolves actually played all right against Aston Villa on Sunday but they still lost again. There are six months of the season left to play but, let's face it, they've had it.  They still only have two points from their first 13 games, and there is no way Rob Edwards can rescue them from here.  They could bring in Pep Guardiola, Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho - three of the great Premier League managers - and they still wouldn't keep them up. Wolves do have something to play for, though. I didn't think any team could be as bad as Robbie Savage's Derby County side that went down with a record Premier League low of 11 points in 2007-08, so beating that total is maybe their only aim now. Nottingham Forest's defeat by Brighton on Sunday was a bit of a sickener for Sean Dyche, because he had made such a good start there.  His team should be too streetwise for Wolves, though. Sutton's prediction: 0-1 Felix's prediction: It's hard to see Wolves winning a game at the moment. 1-2 AI's prediction: 2-1 Elland Road, 20:15 Leeds lumped it in the second half against Manchester City and it almost got them a point.  They were lucky to still be in the game at half-time but fair play to Daniel Farke for making the substitutes and changing the system, because he has been accused of not being proactive enough during games. As lively as Leeds were, they still ended up empty-handed, however, and it means they really need something here.  You know they will give it a go but, again, it is going to be hard for them to get anything out of a Chelsea side who are in really good form. There might be a bit of an edge to this one, because going back to my time as a Chelsea player there was always a rivalry here.  I don't think it will be as rough and tumble as it was when these teams met in the 1970 FA Cup final, but I'm going for the same outcome, which is a Chelsea win. Sutton's prediction: 0-2 Felix's prediction: I am going to call a mad one here for the sake of it. 1-0 AI's prediction: 1-2 Anfield, 20:15 I got Liverpool wrong at the weekend because I thought they would lose at West Ham. Instead of Mo Salah, it was a case of 'No Salah' after he was left out for their 2-0 win. I didn't mind seeing that, because Salah is no different from any other player - if he is not performing, you drop him. I was wrong about Sunderland too, but that won't surprise anyone.  We are at the stage where I am thinking should I do Black Cats fans a favour by tipping them to lose again here, because we know what happens when I do that - they win. I actually think they will give a good account of themselves at Anfield and it would not surprise me at all to see them going there and winning - I really mean that, too, because we've all seen how capable Regis le Bris' side are. I am still going to go with Liverpool though. I don't think they can be as bad as they were in their last two home games, against Nottingham Forest and PSV Eindhoven. Sutton's prediction: 2-1 Felix's prediction: When Sunderland came to Craven Cottage last week they let us have a lot of the ball. It was like they were thinking they could sting us on the counter-attack but they almost looked like they were going to get found out. We had 20-odd chances, so I can't believe Liverpool won't do the same. 2-0 AI's prediction: 3-1 Old Trafford, 20:00 Manchester United fought back to beat Crystal Palace on Sunday but they didn't really deserve it. They are still a basket case of a club, and you could say the same about West Ham. How can I predict what Ruben Amorim's side will do? No-one can. I can't get my head around them. There is no reason to back them here, or West Ham either. The Hammers pushed Liverpool close on Sunday, but they did not really threaten very much despite the Reds being so vulnerable defensively at the moment. There definitely won't be many goals in this game, but I already know I am going to be wrong about it. In fact, I wish I didn't have to make a prediction here, but I've been told I have to. Sutton's prediction: 2-0 Felix's prediction: I am going to say Nuno Espirito Santo gets a point. 0-0 AI's prediction: 2-2 There was a three-way tie for victory at the weekend, but Chris was not involved. He got three correct results with no exact scores from the 10 games in week 13, for a total of 30 points. Instead, the win was shared between the BBC readers, AI and Chris' guest - rapper Kofi Stone. They all got four correct results, with no exact scores, for a total of 40 points.

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"As I walked into the medical clinic for my blood test, all I could think about was how to avoid looking like a wimp on camera. I didn't really contemplate what the test would reveal. I am not great with needles - but as part of a BBC Panorama investigation into so-called forever chemicals, I was being tested to see what level of them I had in my blood. As a mum with two small children, I also wanted to know whether they may be having an impact on my family. Forever chemicals, or PFAS (per-and poly fluoroalkyl substances), are a group of about 10,000 chemicals. They have been used for decades, in anything from waterproof clothes, to cookware, electronics and medical equipment. They are persistent pollutants, meaning they don't degrade easily and instead build up in the environment. They exist in our homes, our water and in our food. Scientists have linked a small number of them to serious harms, such as infertility and cancer. Any level of PFAS above 2ng (nanograms) per millilitre of blood is considered to bring health risks, according to Dr Sabine Donnai, a specialist in preventative healthcare. She has never met anyone without at least some PFAS in their bloodstream. My result was 9.8ng per millilitre. Dr Donnai delivered the news very gently - but it still hit me hard. The forever chemicals in my blood would \"most likely\" have an impact on my health, she told me. I also learned that, sadly, my body would have rid itself of some of these chemicals during pregnancy, by passing it on to my babies. That was the moment this investigation stopped being just work and felt very personal. \"They [PFAS levels] would have been even higher before your pregnancies,\" Dr Donnai told me. \"You will have passed on to your children for sure.\" I was worried, but I also felt angry about how this could have happened without me having any knowledge, and very little control. I wanted to know more about these substances and the health issues they have been linked to. PFAS chemicals \"don't break down\", said Stephanie Metzger from the Royal Society of Chemistry. \"Once they get into our bodies, they stick around and build up little-by-little until they start to interfere with our systems. \"Some PFAS have been linked to thyroid problems, some to kidney and liver cancer, and some have been shown to affect fertility.\" As for me, it is \"unlikely\" I will be able to bring my levels to zero, said Dr Donnai.  \"But you can reduce it over the next two or three years with a strategy.\" She suggested I increase my fibre intake - either by eating more oats, barley, beans, nuts and seeds, or by taking supplements of gel-forming fibre. Increased fibre in our diet is \"the strongest evidence to date that might help\", she said. If I did these things, menstruation would also help reduce my current PFAS levels over time, she added. She also told me to identify the biggest sources of exposure in my home - replace my non-stick cookware with ceramic, stainless steel or cast iron alternatives, use a water filter and switch to eco-friendly cleaning products which are transparent about being PFAS-free.  Look for PFAS-free make-up and hair products and avoid ingredients with \"fluoro\" or \"PTFE\" in the name, she added.  Similar advice was given to mum-to-be Pam Kavanagh, who we visited at home in Berkshire with Dr Federica Amati of Imperial College London. Pam was eager to know how to reduce the possible household risks of PFAS to her baby - and Dr Amati has studied how babies and children can be affected by forever chemicals. \"When we drink tap water, we are, depending on where you live, at varying levels of exposure to PFAS,\" Dr Amati said. Just buying a water filter can help to reduce exposure, she said - whether that is a jug with a filter in it, or a filter installed into the actual sink. Any non-stick frying pans with scratches on them should be thrown out, Dr Amati advised. Stainless steel or ceramic pans \"are far safer\", she said. Carpets can be treated with PFAS to make them more stain resistant, she added, suggesting that people vacuum their carpets every day. \"Making sure you ventilate the room by opening the windows every single day is a good idea [because] it really collects as house dust,\" she added Dr Amati then turned to children's clothing. Pam was left \"speechless\" to discover that waterproof or stain-resistant clothing can contain PFAS. Manufacturers are under no obligation to disclose this information. Some children's products are not PFAS-free, despite claiming to be, the BBC learned. We found PFAS in a children's coat we bought from the Mountain Warehouse website a few months ago, even though the site says that none of its children's products are made with forever chemicals. The jacket we tested came from a small batch of old stock, made more than three years ago, Mountain Warehouse told the BBC. Although the coat \"meets UK safety standards\", it added, the product has now been withdrawn from sale. The company said it was working \"to eliminate PFAS from all products as soon as possible\" and that \"children's clothing manufactured since 2023 is PFAS-free\". If fabrics containing PFAS come into \"prolonged contact with human skin\" there's the potential the chemicals can be absorbed across the skin, explained Prof Stuart Harrad at the University of Birmingham, who tested the coat for us. To reduce the risk, opt for untreated fabrics and avoid \"waterproof\" or \"stain-repellent\" labels unless they have a PFAS-free certification, said Dr Donnai. Our greatest exposure to forever chemicals comes from food - particularly fish, meat, eggs, fruit and fruit products, according to the European Food Safety Authority. An innocent-looking strawberry could have PFAS exposure, I learned, because the chemicals can be added to pesticides \"to help them stick better to the fruit, so when it rains it doesn't wash off\", explained Prof David Megson of Manchester Metropolitan University. Of the assortment of picnic items we laid out, a bottle of wine could carry the greatest PFAS risk, Prof Megson told me. \"We concentrate hundreds of grapes into each bottle. As the wider pesticide breaks down, the PFAS bit is left behind,\" he said. PFAS chemicals are so embedded in modern life that none of us can fully escape them. They have made our lives convenient and our products durable - but at a potential cost we are only now beginning to count. The European Commission is consulting on an outright ban on about 10,000 PFAS chemicals. The UK government says it is looking to ban or restrict some chemicals but has not committed to a blanket ban. It told us that it is \"working at pace with regulators to assess levels of PFAS in the environment, their sources and potential risks\" to inform its approach to \"policy and regulation\". PFAS chemicals have many essential uses, and safer substitutes are not yet available, argues the Chemical Industries Association. It says \"regulators and industry need to work together in setting transition periods\" to bring alternatives to market. When I first had the blood tests, I thought it would provide an interesting scene for our documentary. But once you know these chemicals are inside you, you can't unknow it.  Having a plan to reduce my exposure is a small comfort. But I'll be honest, it is also another thing to worry about. Get our flagship newsletter with all the headlines you need to start the day.

The recent 14-inch MacBook Pro refresh also has an M5 chip. In case you forgot, here\u2019s a refresher: Intel had been making Mac chips since the transition from PowerPC to Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s x86 microarchitecture in 2006. The last time Intel made a Mac chip came before 2020, when Apple first introduced its own silicon, the M1. To be clear: Apple would not be switching back to Intel-designed chips, according to Kuo\u2019s report. Intel would only be the manufacturer of Apple silicon, the same way TSMC is. Kuo said that Apple normally doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t order as many lowest-end M series chips, and this new deal will have \u00e2\u0080\u009cvirtually no material impact on TSMC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fundamentals.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Apple has an obvious reason to look for a U.S.-based chipmaker. The company is desperate to keep on the good side of the nativist sensibilities of President Donald Trump. Beyond offering Trump a 24-karat gold statue, Apple needs to at least appear like it is focused on making its products in the U.S., even if it\u2019s in such a limited capacity. The Intel-made Mac chips wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t arrive until 2027 at the earliest, estimates Kuo. This would put it in line to be the supposed M7 chip. According to the reliable slate of leakers, Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reportedly planning to drop a heap of new Macs in 2026. We may start the year off with 16-inch MacBook Pro models with M5 Pro and M5 Max. However, the real exciting stuff may come later in the year with a more advanced MacBook Pro model with an OLED display and\u00e2\u0080\u0094for the first time on Macs\u00e2\u0080\u0094a touchscreen. Apple may also be working on a smaller, lower-end MacBook sporting Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s iPhone chip instead of the M-series, which could prove the most accessible way for consumers to buy into Apple\u00e2\u0080\u0099s laptop ecosystem. In the face of these new styles of Mac, Intel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s new chipmaking deal may seem even less significant. However, for Intel, the deal would be a major victory in its long-term ambition to become a chip foundry for more than its first-party processors. Even if Intel and Apple announce a full deal, we can assume consumers won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to tell the difference between old and new Macs, with or without an \u00e2\u0080\u009cIntel Inside\u00e2\u0080\u009d sticker on the laptop.

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"Cyber Monday 2025 Absolute Best Deals Deals Under $100 Laptop Deals Kindle Deals Apple Deals Tech Deals Headphone Deals Sleep Deals Phone Deals Coffee Deals Smart Birdfeeder Deals Hyperice's Cyber Monday deals are live, and they're not ones to miss. Hyperice is one of the top wellness recovery brands in the industry, trusted by athletes, college sports programs, and professional facilities. From percussive massage guns to heated wraps, we've rounded up the best Hyperice Cyber Monday deals. All of these gadgets have been tested and vetted by WIRED staffers, but we've also included some gear that we have yet to test if the discount may be too good to pass up. Products are selling out fast, and the prices change frequently, so check back for the latest updates. For more intel on sales, check out our Best Cyber Monday Deals roundup or our Cyber Monday liveblog. Updated December 1: We've updated pricing and ensured all these deals are still live for Cyber Monday. Hyperice Amazon Hyperice REI The Hypervolt 2 is the best percussive massage gun on the market (for most people). At 1.8 pounds, it's light enough to pick up after an intense workout, and the 60-watt brushless motor delivers relatively quiet percussions. It has three speed settings and five interchangeable heads (fork, ball, cushion, flat, and bullet), and it's built with a pressure sensor that lets you know when you're pushing too hard, kind of like an electric toothbrush. You can usually get around three hours of continuous use per charge, and since it's TSA-friendly, you can throw it in your carry-on for long travels. Nike \u00d7 Hyperice Hyperice Dick's Sporting Goods Nike The Hyperboot is on sale for the first time. These recovery boots pair the brand's heat tech with its Normatec-like compression for a warm, pressurized therapy that feels incredible both before and after a workout. You can toggle between three compression levels (50, 130, and 210 mmHg) and heat (111, 118, and 125 degrees Fahrenheit) using the built-in control panel. Slip on both, and they sync automatically. You typically get around 90 minutes of continuous use per charge, depending on how hot and tight you run them. They're IP54 rated, meaning they're dust- and splash-resistant. They're also TSA-approved. Hyperice Amazon Hyperice Best Buy Whether I'm running, traveling, or sitting too long at my desk, my calves are the first place I feel pain. Hyperice's portable air-compression sleeves have become my go-to remedy when I'm sore or stiff. They're also a useful recovery to have if you struggle with bad circulation or chronic pain. There are seven intensity levels, 360-degree compression, and three overlapping zones that deliver a rhythmic relief I can't get from a massage gun. I'd happily pay full price for the Normatec go, so seeing them on sale is just a cherry on top. Hyperice Amazon Hyperice The Hyperice X Shoulder is a contrast therapy wrap that's smarter than your typical ice pack or heating pad. With five levels of heat, cold, and compression, you can dial in exactly what you need. It's helpful for warm-ups and recoveries, but especially for rehabbing a minor strain. The battery lasts around 90 minutes on the highest heat setting and about an hour on the highest cold setting. Hyperice Amazon Hyperice Hyperice's Venom 2 Back is a neoprene wrap that delivers vibration therapy and even heat across your lower back. I use it after strenuous strength training and anytime my back aches from hunching over my laptop all day. It's also a game-changer if you suffer from menstrual cramps that extend to your lower back. You can toggle between three heat levels (113, 122, and 131 degrees Fahrenheit) and three vibration frequencies. It boosts circulation, loosens tight muscles, and is overall a great tool to have for mobility warm-ups. I especially appreciate the 15-minute auto shut-off, so I don't have to worry about overdoing it.

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"Getting a Snapdragon 8 Elite tablet for only $580 is INSANE, but you can do just that for a few more hours.   When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Why pay over $1,000 for a premium Android tablet when you can grab one that's just as good for roughly half the price? That's the question OnePlus has us asking with its insane OnePlus Pad 3 deal that's still around for a few more hours on Cyber Monday. The OnePlus Pad 3 is a bona-fide flagship with an outstanding Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, and it can rival the most expensive tablets from Samsung and Apple. It's already priced competitively at $700 regularly, but this holdover Black Friday deal slashes another $120 off the sticker price, making the Pad 3 only $580. That's only a bit more than the Pixel Tablet and it's less than half the cost of Samsung's Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra at full price. You only have a few more hours to take advantage of this deal, so move fast of you want a great Android tablet for a more affordable price. The OnePlus Pad 3 is an excellent Android tablet powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, 12GB of memory, and a 12,140mAh battery. It packs a sleek design and a 13.2-inch LCD screen.  Price comparison: Best Buy - $579.99 | OnePlus - $579.99 \u2705Recommended if: you want a large and powerful Android tablet for productivity, content consumption, and gaming; you want optional upgrades to 16GB RAM and 512GB storage; you need a tablet with a great screen. \u274cSkip this deal if: you need an OLED screen; you don't like OxygenOS. Tablets are useful devices, but they don't need to cost a fortune. That's exactly what the OnePlus Pad 3 gets right. It sports one of the largest screens of any Android tablet on the market, with a 13.2-inch LCD panel featuring a 3392 x 2400 resolution and a 144Hz refresh rate. On top of that, there's a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip paired with 12GB or 16GB or memory to handle just about anything. That's similar, or better than, the best Samsung has to offer. For example, the latest Samsung Galaxy Tab models have shipped with MediaTek processors following a switch from Qualcomm chips. If you want the best Qualcomm chips for AI and general performance, the OnePlus Pad 3 is your only option. Better yet, it's more affordable than a Samsung tablet. It runs Android 16, and OxygenOS has come a long way, so it's very easy to use. There are also incredible multitasking features like Open Canvas, which lets you use up to five apps at once. If I was in the market for an Android tablet this Cyber Monday, I'd go for the OnePlus Pad 3. It's much better than cheaper options while hitting a reasonable price point, which is something that Samsung's flagship tablets can't do. If you need a new tablet or a great gift, grab this OnePlus Pad 3 deal while you still can.

The Bank of Japan raised fears about a repeat of the yen carry trade unwind to start the week, reviving concerns about the country's central bank tightening monetary policy.  So why exactly is a central bank on the other side of the planet spooking US investors?  It is helpful to recall the moment in August 2024, when volatility suddenly surged after Japanese government bond yields spiked. This created a tough situation for investors who had put on the \"yen carry trade,\" which involves borrowing yen at low interest rates and then converting it into dollars to invest in US assets, such as stocks. When rates rise in Japan, investors can be forced to unwind leveraged bets to cover higher borrowing costs.  Investors on Monday were fearing the Bank of Japan's policy maneuvering could cause another spasm of volatility after governor Kazuo Ueda said the central bank would consider raising interest rates at its upcoming meeting, delivering more hawkish views than markets had been expecting.  Markets are pricing in an 80% chance that the Bank of Japan, which has kept borrowing costs low for decades, will continue to raise rates at its December policy meeting. The reaction in both stocks and bonds was negative.  Japan's 2-year government bond yield climbed three basis points to trade 1.02% in the early morning, its highest level since 2008. The nation's 10-year Treasury note also ticked up by six basis points to around 1.8%, its highest level in 17 years. Risk assets in the US, meanwhile, were down broadly. Major indexes tumbled early Monday but were recovering some of their losses by about midday.  Here's where major US indexes stood around 1 p.m. on Monday:  Meanwhile, there wasn't much reprieve to be found in US bonds, which also saw yields spike. The 10-year US Treasury yield climbed seven basis points to 4.09% and the 2-year Treasury yield rose four basis points to 3.5%. The fresh pivot to risk-off hit crypto the hardest, with bitcoin down as much as 8% and still reeling from its sharp descent into a bear market since peaking in early October.  Bitcoin traded as low as $84,000, pulling the token down around 32% from its peak in early October. Ethereum also dropped 8.9% on Monday, marking a 41.8% decline over the same timeframe. Japan's central bank appears to be \"driving the sentiment shift\" in markets this week, Thierry Wizman, the global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie Group, said on Monday. \"Traders are having second thoughts, it seems, about having run stocks up as much as they did last week,\" Wizman wrote in a client note on Monday. Stocks enjoyed a relatively strong holiday-shortened week.  \"Financial markets are kicking off December in a turbulent fashion as policy tightening hints from the Bank of Japan nudge global rates higher and dull the dollar's appeal,\" Karl Schamotta, the chief market strategist at Corpay, wrote in a note, pointing to how the yen gained against the US dollar. \"Traders are waking up this Monday after a quiet Thanksgiving to an overwhelming sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, as a surge in the Japanese yen is once again playing havoc with markets,\" Nic Puckrin, an investment analyst at The Coin Bureau, wrote in a note. \"The Japanese yen carry trade is once again beginning to unwind,\" he added.

Aside from potentially dissuading porch pirates and would-be burglars, security cameras are a good way to check in on your kids and pets, and add motion lighting to outside areas. Many of our favorite indoor security cameras, outdoor security cameras, and video doorbells are on sale. If you seek a wider selection of discounts, check out our Very Best Cyber Monday Deals roundup. Arlo Amazon Best Buy Arlo ticks all the boxes with crisp 2K video, a wide 160-degree field of view, two-way audio, and direct Wi-Fi connection, and the Pro 5S is my pick of the best outdoor security cameras. The Arlo app is swift to load, offers rich notifications, and supports two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face, phone permitting. The catch is a pricey subscription for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. TP-Link Amazon B&H TP-Link As my top pick of the best indoor security cameras, the Tapo C120 has everything. It records video at up to 2K resolution, supports two-way audio (with a slight lag), and supports up to 512-GB microSD cards for local recording. There's impressive color night vision, on-device smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles) without a subscription, and it even has an IP66 rating, which means you can also use it outdoors (provided you can run the power cable). We like this camera at its usual price (it hovers around $35), so this is a deal worth bagging. Nest Amazon Walmart Google Best Buy Doorbells don\u2019t get smarter than this, and the Nest Doorbell tops our best video doorbells guide. Many newer doorbells tout higher resolutions than the Nest\u2019s 1080p (including the new wired model from Nest), but at 30 frames per second with HDR support, this still turns out quality footage. You also get smarts like face recognition, so you know whether the kids are home or a stranger is lurking on your porch. But you need a pricey Google Home Premium subscription from $10 a month ($100\/year), though it covers all your Nest cameras. Eufy Amazon Eufy This versatile, pan-and-tilt camera is ideal if you want a hands-off device. The built-in solar panel keeps the battery topped off. The camera features a dual-lens system with a main lens that boasts a 135-degree field of view and records sharp video, paired with a telephoto lens that offers 3X zoom in the center of the frame (it goes up to 8X hybrid zoom). There\u2019s also 8 GB of storage built in to keep things local. Amazon Amazon Amazon (With Weather Resistant Adapter) More and more good-quality, affordable security cameras are hitting the market, and the Blink Mini 2 is one of our favorites. It can record 1080p footage at up to 30 fps, offers decent low-light performance, and boasts on-device person detection. The catch is the subscription at $4 per month or $40 per year for a single camera, but it nets you a generous 60-day unlimited cloud video history. This camera is ideal for sitting unobtrusively on a shelf and keeping an eye on your home when you are away. Reolink Walmart Walmart (Solar) You can record continuously with this battery-powered pan-and-tilt camera in up to 4K resolution, which is a rare combination, but you will need to charge it up quite often (weekly), even with the solar panel, unless you live somewhere very sunny. It can pan 355 degrees and tilt 90 degrees, supports Wi-Fi 6 (2.4 or 5 GHz), and has a versatile L-shaped bracket for easy installation on a wall or roof. Eufy Amazon Eufy Best Buy Security cameras with floodlights are great for your garage or backyard, since motion triggers light and color video. The E340 is a dual-lens camera with a 3K wide-angle lens and a 2K telephoto lens for up to 8X zoom to capture details up to 50 feet away. Adjustable light panels provide up to 2,000 lumens. It also pans 360 degrees and tilts 120 degrees, and records locally to a microSD card or to a HomeBase 3 (both sold separately). Google Amazon Walmart Best Buy The Home Depot A tasty 25 percent discount on Google's newest indoor Nest Cam is a great enticement to upgrade to 2K. You can expect crisp video day or night, familiar face recognition, and accurate animated alerts, but you need a Google Home Premium subscription ($10 per month) to get the most from it, and there's no local storage option. Eufy Amazon Best Buy Eufy This incredibly versatile device has a dual-lens design, combining a regular 4K camera with a 130-degree field of view with a 2K telephoto lens that supports 3x optical zoom. You can pan 360 degrees and tilt 75 degrees, there\u2019s AI tracking with up to four preset positions, privacy mode, two-way audio, and onboard AI to detect people, pets, and sounds. Record locally with a microSD card or HomeBase 3 (both sold separately). Arlo Amazon (2K) Best Buy (2K) Walmart (1080p) Offering everything you want, including crisp 2K video at 24 frames per second, two-way audio, and a compact design that includes a privacy shutter, little wonder this is the upgrade pick in our best indoor security cameras guide. The Arlo app is swift to load, offers excellent notifications, and supports two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face, phone permitting. We\u2019ve seen discounts before but never this low. Just remember to factor in the pricey subscription. Amazon Amazon Amazon (With Sync 2 Module) This is the cheapest video doorbell worth considering, offering 1080p video, but with a limited field of view (135 degrees horizontal and only 80 degrees vertical). Notifications lack images or video and they come through slower than some of the competition, but they do arrive. The two-way audio is passable, and it takes two AA batteries. Buy it with the Sync Module to enable local recording.  Amazon Best Buy This two-camera kit comes with a home hub, and, although there are newer models, it's still an excellent system. The EufyCam 3 has built-in solar, up to 4K video resolution, and 16 GB of local storage (expandable up to 16 TB) on the connected HomeBase 3 hub. You also get on-device people, pets, and vehicle recognition, and this system can even recognize familiar faces.

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":" KabutoPok\u00c3\u00a9mon TCG  During these revolting times, what we need are heroes. Step forward one such person, offering a bright light of hope into our murky days: the Kabuto King. This anonymous figure (because all the best superheroes are) appeared from nowhere in August this year, with a single and singular goal: to collect every first edition Kabuto card from the Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon TCG\u2018s Fossil set. He\u2019s currently at 1,748. Why? Because no one else did yet. New Kabutos: 30Total Kabuto Count: 1748 The show goes on \u00f0\u009f\u0091\u0091 pic.twitter.com\/saoScQIslC \u2014 Kabuto King (@KabutoKing_) November 29, 2025  It\u2019s not uncommon for\u00c2\u00a0Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon collectors to try to find one of every card of a favourite pocket monster. I, for instance, have collected one of every English-language Mantine and am working on the Japanese versions now. But most people tend to stick to one of each, rather than every single one of the same card. That is Kabuto King\u2019s goal: gathering the cards in any condition, graded or loose, in their thousands, with the intention of buying up every single one. What makes the Kabuto King\u2019s quest quite so excellent is that Kabuto is\u2026look, I\u2019m not setting out to offend anyone, but it\u2019s hardly the most glamorous of Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon. Not one of Ken Sugimori\u2019s most inspired designs, the creature first introduced in the original Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon games is essentially just a brown horseshoe crab with glowy red eyes at the front. Kabuto first appeared in the Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon TCG in 1999\u2019s Fossil set, in the ignominious position of 50\/62, tucked between the similarly unimaginative Horsey and Krabby. It received no holo pattern, and until the last few months\u00e2\u0080\u0094even with a 1st Edition badge\u00e2\u0080\u0094was of almost no value. In July of this year, you could have bought yourself one for less than a dollar. Right now, the market price, according to TCGPlayer, is over $28. Catching on as a meme, many people are rooting through binders to see if they\u2019ve a spare card they can send the King\u2019s way (I checked, I don\u2019t, sadface emoji), while the masked figure scoops up every example they can find on eBay and other marketplaces. And as a result, the prices are climbing fast. Kabuto King himself has noticed that eBay sellers are suddenly declaring themselves \u201csold out,\u201d likely in order to relist the previously worthless cards at their new, higher price. Wow. Ebay sellers cancelling orders from days ago saying \u00e2\u0080\u009cout of stock\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That is BS. They will 100% re-list later at a much higher price. If you list something and someone buys it for your asking price you need to honor it. \u2014 Kabuto King (@KabutoKing_) December 1, 2025  Incredibly, after a post from the X account on November 26 went viral, some are trying to compare King Kabuto\u2019s antics to those of NFT sellers and the farce of artificial scarcity. As observed by @StarPlatinum, humorless people began claiming this action is the same as \u201cwhale concentration,\u201d presumably because the crypto-brained are really incapable of discerning reality from the imaginary nonsense that drives their every moment. Big news here, but Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon cards are actually real objects, tangible and corporeal, and as such, their scarcity is never artificial. This is just one person buying all the real-life cards because they want to, and it\u2019s funny. And, of course, no one cared a jot about the Kabuto cards before they started. With daily updates on X, Kabuto King shows a photo of all the new 1st ed Kabuto he\u2019s bought, and then the bulk box in which they\u2019re all being stored. It\u2019s a beautiful sight, and the speed with which it\u2019s all happening is breathtaking. The card had never been worth more than $10 in its 26 years of existence, but now it is the priciest non-holos in the Fossil set! Extraordinarily, it\u2019s currently valued higher than the non-holo Moltres, Articuno, and Zapdos, traditionally the three best regular cards to pull in the set.

Apple and Amazon were a surprisingly potent tag team during the Black Friday deals, and it looks like that pattern is holding strong for Cyber Monday, if the hot deal on the 2025 M5 MacBook Pro is any indication. Apple\u2019s latest and best flagship laptop is holding steady at its all-time-low price of $1,349 at Amazon. This was one of the best Black Friday deals, and now it\u2019s one of the best Cyber Monday deals. The M5 chip has a 10-core CPU and a 10-core GPU, which is more than enough muscle for any and everything from data processing and ultra-fast gaming to heavy-duty creative work and video editing. Among the many huge engineering upgrades Apple has put into the M5 are hardware-accelerated ray tracing for superior rendering and graphics tasks, and a beefed-up neural-engine performance to give you the best and fastest version of Apple Intelligence you can find anywhere. See at Amazon Apple cornered the market on laptops and devices for creative professionals years ago, and they keep piling on new features and new releases to keep their hold on that market intact. In the short time since its release, the M5 MacBook Pro has become\u00c2\u00a0the laptop for creative professionals and hobbyists alike, thanks to its incredible graphic power, the industry-best Liquid Retina XDR display, and the laptop itself, since the MacBook Pro\u2019s sleek design makes it a thing beauty compared to its chunkier PC competitors. Now that AI has become such a prominent part of creative work, the MacBook Pro\u2019s grip on that sector only gets stronger with this latest model. Apple Intelligence\u2019s already amazing powers are even more amazing with the M5 processor and its robust neural engine, and the result is faster and more incredible AI for creative tasks or anything else. The vast power and nearly endless list of features of the M5 MacBook Pro aren\u2019t entirely geared toward content creators, designers, musicians, and the rest of the creative crowd. The MacBook Pro\u2019s basic laptop benchmarks are all in 5-star territory. The Liquid Retina XDR display and the speed of the M5 chip\u2019s 10 GPU cores make the MacBook Pro an elite-level streaming device, and its battery life is among the very best of any laptop, Mac or PC. Anyone who finds Windows 11 to be a little less than intuitive or who gets frustrated by the frequent updates and reboots that have been synonymous with Windows forever might want to choose the MacBook Pro as the jumping-off point for switching to Apple\u2019s famously clean interface and exceptionally stable OS. There\u2019s a reason you still see decade-old Macs popping up for sale on discount sites \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the MacBook is a far more future-proofed laptop than the PC, especially when you shoot high and land the elite-level M5 MacBook Pro. There will be M6 and M7 MacBooks in the future with all sorts of new perks and amazing features. But the chances are pretty good that even that far down the road, the M5 MacBook Pro will still be chugging along at your desk, doing its thing and doing it well. With the all-time-low $1,349 price at Amazon extending into Cyber Monday, it\u2019s an even worthier investment than ever. See at Amazon Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"India is requiring smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung to preload devices sold in the country with a state-owned cyber security app that can't be deleted, reports Reuters. The Department of Communications in India is giving smartphone companies 90 days to begin preinstalling the Sanchar Saathi government app on all new devices that are sold. It has also requested that manufacturers push software updates to devices that are already in the supply chain. Users are supposed to be informed of the app at the first use or when the device is set up, and the app's feature set is not able to be turned off or restricted. India is aiming to cut down on fraud and cyber crime, and the app is supposedly meant to provide additional security to smartphone users while also informing them about government initiatives. It is able to verify the authenticity of IMEIs to prevent stolen devices from being used with duplicate or spoofed identifiers. A website for the app says that it lets users report suspected fraud, block and track lost or stolen devices from being used, verify the authenticity of a device, report international spam calls, and verify telephone numbers. The app includes detailed tracking functionality controlled by the government, so there are privacy and security implications for iPhone users. The majority of smartphone users in India have Android devices, and it's a market that Apple is trying to expand in. Apple has not acquiesced to a government request for a fully preloaded \u200ciPhone\u200c app, so it will presumably find a way around India's mandate. Counterpoint Research told Reuters that Apple will likely negotiate for a middle ground, such as informing users of the app rather than preinstalling it. Russia has a similar preinstall mandate for government-approved apps. During setup, iPhones in Russia have a prompt suggesting users install the apps, but opting out is possible.

Madison Avenue's center of gravity is shifting. Omnicom is now officially the world's largest ad agency holding company, thanks to its $9 billion acquisition of Interpublic Group, which closed Friday. The combination brings together creative and media agencies, health marketing specialists, and production studios. They are all set to be underpinned by data from its Acxiom data-management company and Omni, which the company describes as its advanced intelligence platform. The agency mega-merger is also set to bring about more than $750 million in cost savings, including 4,000 job cuts related to the transaction, the company said Monday. Omnicom chairman and CEO John Wren told Business Insider in an interview on Monday that the merger would give the company fresh agility and scale. \"We will be in a position, for the foreseeable future, to be able to create the best commercial terms for our clients,\" Wren said. \"Underpinning that is a platforms group powered by generative AI that will be far unmatchable unless you're one of the big six tech companies.\" Announced in December, the stock-for-stock transaction was initially valued at about $13 billion, but closed at roughly $9 billion because both Omnicom and IPG's shares fell in the months after. Wren said Omnicom's stock price is \"set to correct very quickly because of all the benefits that we're going to get\" from the IPG acquisition. Business Insider spoke with Wren and other members of the Omnicom leadership team to learn what the deal reveals about the health of the advertising business, an industry facing multiple competitive threats and the rise of new technologies, such as AI. They also shared why Omnicom clients and staff should feel exhilarated by the close of the deal, and how the ad group's AI strategy differs from its competitors. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. Business Insider: How would you characterize the current state of Madison Avenue? Some of the observers and analysts looking at this merger have said it doesn't reflect an industry in a position of strength. John Wren: In terms of where this is all headed, and why I think there is tremendous growth, is that with the improvements that are coming on board with technology, with the unique database that we're going to be able to provide our employees for insights and knowledge, we're going to get closer and closer to that holy grail of wanting to be paid based upon agreed KPIs and performance.  We get paid well when you, the client, do well, and we suffer when you suffer.  That's where it's moving toward. Business Insider: A lot of the focus today has been on the job cuts related to the transaction. There have already been thousands of job cuts across IPG and Omnicom since the deal was first announced. How should current Omnicom employees feel about their job security going into 2026? Wren: IPG was fairly aggressive throughout the first three quarters of 2025. Quite a bit of that was right-sizing them for some of the business casualties they had in the past. I've never taken cuts lightly at all, because they affect not only the individual but the individual's family. This is an acquisition, but our people approach it from a talent point of view, as if it were a merger of equals, where, if there were two people competing for one position, the best person won \u2014 not because they were Omnicom, they win by default. We held very true to something I said very early on, that people who are generating revenue and creating ideas and growth for clients, their jobs were to be safe. In principle, I think we accomplished that. We did it pretty fairly between the two groups. We've been planning for this and rather anxious about it, because we don't want to leave employees with the impression that, oh, this is just going to be a rolling cut and uncertainties. We're trying to get as much of it done now \u2014between today and December 15 \u2014 as is humanly possible and is correct. It's principally over, so people can be secure, but it's never quite finished because there's ongoing stuff that doesn't have anything to do with the client, doesn't have anything to do with the product, this has to do with us becoming faster and more efficient. Troy Ruhanen, Omnicom Advertising CEO: This move, ultimately, has energized our staff and has energized our clients as they are able to see the full potential of what we can be as an organization. Our staff feel they're capable of being much more of a business partner to our clients, and our clients feel like they can trust us to complete the brand experience.  We've had a really good reaction already from our clients around this news and the capabilities we are bringing together and the places where we are going to demonstrate clear leadership. Business Insider: It seems the ad industry has a \"frenemy\" relationship with AI. You've got no choice but to embrace it. CEOs are asking CMOs to figure out their AI strategies, and you can act as the consultant there. But AI also threatens to automate away many of the services that you once charged those CMOs for. How do you strike the right balance between those things, and what makes Omnicom AI's strategy different from WPP and Publicis? John Wren: Some of that we're not going to disclose to you. This technology probably has an immediate and serious impact on how we can become more efficient. Our current model, which has been morphing, is based on time and materials. As you're eliminating manual types of functions or revitalizing them in some way, you're going to lose some of that labor, but you're going to become more expert. We're going to increasingly get more and more confident about our abilities to be paid for performance. In order to get there, the client's KPIs have to be clearly articulated and explained, and we have to be certain that we can add value to that activity, which we believe we will. But it's going to be a journey. It's not a light switch. Business Insider: What separates you from an Accenture in this area? John Wren: Our data is going to be better. Our insights as a result of that are going to be better. Our geography. How do you add value to that? It's our creative IP and what you do with that to enrich your at-the-moment data that differentiates you, and that's where we are planning to be. We're servicing two-thirds of the leading companies in the world. I hope to expand that relationship with more. We provide services, but we also do a hell of a lot of observation in terms of who's moving, at what pace. We are constantly disrupting and trying to cannibalize ourselves so we are fit for purpose. Paolo Yuvienco, Omnicom chief technology officer: There are several factors that really differentiate us. One is around the first-mover partnerships we established early on, as early as 2022, as it relates to generative AI. We are working side-by-side with the leading researchers within some of the largest technology companies in the world, looking at the advancements that they're making. They're asking us, what are the appropriate use cases for these research projects that they have within their labs. So, because we're adopting the technology and we're operationalizing that technology at great speed, we have the advantage over many of our competitors. Our data, bar none, is the most elite dataset in the industry. On the buy side, the connected graph around identity for that dataset is the most robust and most comprehensively supported graph in the industry. Then our platform strategy, where computation really fuels creativity, is allowing us to create this neural network of commerce, of media, of creativity, using agentic AI to turn data into desire and desire into growth. We can do it faster than any one of the competitors out there, whether they are direct competitors or adjacent competitors, like the management consultancies. Jump to","label":0}

Are you fed up at work? Sick of it all? Ready to throw in the towel? You're likely not alone. The job market isn't providing a lot of opportunities for mobility, keeping most people stuck in place, even if they'd otherwise look to move. But everyone has their limits. The new year is a great time for a professional reassessment. (I'm not suggesting quitting before bonus season. Do you think I'm an animal?) If you're thinking of jumping into the great unknown, we've got some advice for you. BI compiled four personal essays from people who quit their jobs and aren't looking back. The series \u2014 \"Quitting Without Regret\" \u2014 shows that while quitting isn't easy, it can lead to a more intentional and meaningful career. Here's some of the advice that came across in the essays. Have a plan, even if you can't stick to it. Jenny Wood created a detailed spreadsheet to weigh the pros and cons of quitting her job at Google, where she had spent nearly two decades. She also identified the people she wanted to network with before she left. Ultimately, though, she recognized she couldn't plan everything out and had to take action. \"Fear adds friction, which slows you down without actually minimizing risk,\" she said. You just gotta keep livin', man. Quitting isn't always about being frustrated at work. Sometimes it's because you're hoping there's more out there than maintaining what can feel like the status quo. Jim Kukral left his job as a sales director at 54 years old to start a party boat business. He recognizes it's a risk (and his and his wife's retirement at stake), but \"if I don't do it, I feel like I can't break free from this matrix of a world that we've created for ourselves.\" Remember: Work isn't life. What if you love your job? That's the case for Victoria Dobbie. She loves her job at TikTok, but the 30-year-old decided she wanted to travel the world for at least six months. With no kids and no partner, she feels now's the best time to do something she's always wanted to do. Don't let the golden handcuffs scare you. Jay Gengelbach was making $700K working in tech when he quit in mid-2024. He was terrified of walking away from such a big compensation package, but was feeling unfulfilled. He eventually landed at a smaller tech company, where he's enjoying the quicker pace of delivering things at a smaller company. Jump to","label":0}

Easily the most popular laptop\/PC we\u2019ve seen being sold this Black Friday and Cyber Monday is Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro 11, something which I gave a perfect score for and still use (when I\u2019m not using Surface Laptop 7, of course). We\u2019ve had a few deals posted on this one, but as I write, the $699 model just came back in stock again, which is $500 off the regular price, and $50 cheaper than Best Buy. You get an LCD panel, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and that zippy Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus processor. Easily the sweet spot for Surface Pro and easy to recommend. Of course, if you want baller, then go for the OLED model with Snapdragon X Elite. It\u2019s $200 more at $899 ($500 savings), but it\u2019s a heckuva thing. Microsoft's flagship Surface Pro 11 (13-inch) is now just $699 and includes a 120Hz LCD touchscreen, 16GB RAM, 512GB storage, and the incredible Snapdragon X Plus chip which balances great performance and efficiency.  The Surface Pro deal includes Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon X Elite processor with a high-performance NPU for Copilot+ features, 16 GB of LPDDR5 memory, and a 256 GB SSD. It uses a 13-inch OLED touchscreen with a 3:2 aspect ratio. You also get WiFi support, Bluetooth, integrated graphics for everyday tasks, and a Surface Connect port alongside USB-C. The built-in kickstand allows easy switching between tablet, laptop, and even drawing. Windows Central review: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 If you want a smaller package perfect for travel or the couch, you can do no wrong with the Microsoft Surface Pro 12-inch, which is down to $649.99 (versus $899), and that includes the keyboard, 16GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. The Surface Pro 12-inch is a smaller and more affordable alternative to the full-size Surface Pro 11. Battery life is decent, but the PC really shines thanks to the performant Snapdragon X Plus chip inside. If you want a compact and mobile 2-in-1, this is the way to go. This bundle includes a Type Cover. Handheld PC gaming is growing quickly, but despite new devices like Xbox Ally and Ally X, it\u2019s the OG Steam Deck LCD that stole the show. Valve did a rare sale for the entry-level version, knocking 20% off from $399 to $319. Bad news? Between our podcast and my writing this, Valve pulled the plug. So, you can still get it at full price, OR what I recommend, spend $449 (usually $699) and get the superior Lenovo Legion Go S with SteamOS at Best Buy. It has a larger, higher resolution display with a 120Hz refresh (vs just 60Hz on Steam Deck LCD), more storage at 512GB, and a much faster Z2 Go processor, giving you a 20 to 40% jump in FPS. \"Valve's iconic Steam Deck has aged exceptionally well and is still a perfectly capable handheld gaming PC. Its Linux-based SteamOS has matured and remains the best overall experience, streamlining customization and software maintenance with minimal tinkering compared to its Windows-based rivals.\" ~ Richard Devine, Managing EditorWindows Central Review:\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 This gaming handheld has an 8-inch touchscreen that supports Variable Refresh Rate and has a 120Hz refresh rate. The device fits in-hand comfortably and runs the easy-to-navigate SteamOS. An early Black Friday deal drops this model of the Legion Go S to the lowest price we've ever seen. Windows Central review: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd Ugh. Xbox has had quite the year, to say the least, and jacking up the cost of Game Pass Ultimate has not gone over well with anyone, to be honest. But, what if I told you you can buy TWO 3-month Game Pass Ultimate cards for $95.98, giving you six months of unlimited access, and saving $83 (47%) off the regular price? Moreover, you can buy as many as you want and stack them on your account for years. Sure, it\u2019s a pain point now, but you\u2019ll see a bunch in the long term. Heck, our writer Zachary Boddy has done this and is good until the end of 2028, so what\u2019s stopping you?  If you're looking for the best way to stack up on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, you found it. This is the cheapest way to secure stackable 3-month codes, saving you nearly 50% compared to paying per-month after Xbox's recent price increases. You're still saving 20% even going by pre-price increase costs. Boring name, kind of a boring laptop, but the Dell 15 is just $249 and has a real Intel Core processor in it, 8GB of RAM, an impressive 512GB of SSD storage, and get this, the full HD 15.6-inch panel has a 120Hz refresh rate. Yeah, that\u2019s weird. But as I explain to Zac, this is kind of genius, as faster refresh rates make that laptop feel faster due to the smoother animations. Don\u2019t believe me? Turn your gaming rig down to 30Hz and see how fast it feels. The Dell 15 deal offers an AMD Ryzen 3 7320U processor with Radeon 610M graphics, paired with 8 GB of DDR4 memory and a 512 GB NVMe SSD. It features a 15.6-inch Full HD display at 120 Hz with an anti-glare finish, supported by Wi Fi 6, and Bluetooth. One thing Zac and I agree on is that Surface Laptop 7 is the best Windows laptop of all time (non-gaming, of course). Excellent build quality, great touch display, fantastic audio, and now, thanks to Qualcomm, exceptional performance and long battery life. It\u2019s our Mac M1 moment, but without the pretension. You can now get the model with Snapdragon X Elite,1 16GB of RAM, and an eye-opening 1TB of SSD storage for $999, saving $600 off the regular $1,599 price. Many of you have already bought this, and we salute you. It\u2019s simply the best. The Surface Laptop 7 is easily one of the best thin and light Windows laptops you can buy right now, especially if you want a comfy typing experience and a beautiful display. With a Snapdragon X Plus, 16GB RAM, and 256GB SSD, even the regular $999 price is a solid deal, but $200 off certainly doesn't hurt. This configuration of the Surface Laptop 7 includes the more powerful Snapdragon X Elite, paired with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD storage. It's a step up over our recommendation above, with a more powerful processor that can handle gaming and high-performance tasks easier. Here\u2019s another boring on paper, but impressive IRL laptop. The HP OmniBook 5 16-inch, which we recently reviewed, claims 34 hours of battery life from its 2K OLED touch panel, Snapdragon X Plus, and 32GB\/512GB configuration. The reality? Our video test says you ONLY get (checks notes) 25 hours of video playback and 16.5 hours of Microsoft Office usage. Yeah, that\u2019s still incredible, and instead of $899, it\u2019s now just $599 with many of you snapping one up.  The HP OmniBook 5 16 is a great all-rounder with a large 16-inch 2K OLED touch, paired with the latest Snapdragon X Plus, 32GB RAM, and 512GB SSD storage. This is great for daily tasks, productivity workflows, media consumption, and light creative tasks. It\u2019s a workstation for professionals that \u201cnormally\u201d costs $4,000 but is on sale for $998, which is a bit crazy. OK, HP is probably fibbing on that MSRP, even though enterprise does pay a lot for PRO laptops. Nonetheless, it has an RTX 3050 GPU, a serious CPU, and otherwise banging specs that\u2019ll make a killer workstation whether you\u2019re at home, the coffee shop, or the office, at a price that won\u2019t make you cry. It\u2019s back! And it\u2019s gone already. But we talk about Microsoft\u2019s return to its fun tradition for its biggest fans. Featuring nostalgic icons from Microsoft's past, the Windows Ugly Sweater for 2025 is a call back to some of Windows' most iconic products, apps, and services. The sweater includes Paint, Clippy, MSN, Internet Explorer, Minesweeper, and other iconic Windows apps and icons from the past 40 years!

Hilton's CEO said there's one surefire way to build loyalty with a customer. Christopher Nassetta, the executive who has held the hotel chain's reins since 2007, said solving problems for his guests is the key to customer retention. \"People have studied problems and resolution, and it turns out that historically \u2014 and it's true to this day \u2014 that you build more loyalty with a customer when you have a problem, and you solve it well, than if you never had a problem,\" he said on a Saturday episode of Yahoo Finance's \"Opening Bid\" podcast. \"It sounds crazy, but it's true,\" he added. Nassetta said that customers who don't face any problems with the service don't think much about it. But he added, \"If I had a problem and you've managed it really well, you think, 'Hey, wow, they care about me. They're really good at this.'\" The executive said that solving problems for customers is more effective than \"begging forgiveness\" and rewarding \"a million honor points.\" To that end, he said AI integration into the Hilton Honors app has been \"the biggest game changer,\" helping the company resolve customer problems quickly. When reached for comment, a Hilton representative directed Business Insider to a January 2024 news release about Hilton allowing its customers to text properties via its Honors app, SMS, WhatsApp, and other channels. Hilton has over 9,000 properties in 141 countries, consisting of more than 1.3 million rooms. The company plans to add more than 515,000 rooms, per its October earnings report. The company's stock has risen about 15% this year. Nassetta's comments come shortly after another American hospitality giant, Marriott, made headlines in November for abruptly terminating its licensing agreement with short-term rental company Sonder. Marriott guests staying in Sonder facilities received an eleventh-hour notice to vacate the properties, resulting in travel chaos. Previously loyal Marriott guests told Business Insider that the hotel's poor customer service had upended their trip and broken their trust with the brand. Evan Nierman, the founder of Florida-based crisis public relations firm Red Banyan, told Business Insider last month that Marriott should have solved problems for affected customers rather than making them deal with rebookings and processing refunds themselves. \"The lesson is that hospitality companies earn goodwill when they take the burden off the customer,\" Nierman said. \"Relocation, refunds, and clear guidance are essentials, not perks, during a crisis.\" Jump to","label":0}

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"Tackle those fitness goals early with the Garmin Instinct 2X Solar.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  When looking for the best Cyber Monday smartwatch deals, battery life is not something you should overlook. Sure, there are wearables that look nicer and are more feature-packed, but if longevity is what you're looking for, nothing tops the Garmin Instinct 2X Solar, currently 36% off during Amazon's Cyber Monday sale. The Instinct 2X Solar harnesses the power of the sun to deliver virtually unlimited battery life, plus the watch doesn't skimp on durable design and the latest Garmin fitness features. Garmin deals have been coming and going all throughout this Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend, but if you're looking to finally place that order before the sales end, this could be your last chance. Garmin Instinct 2X Solar: $449.99 $289.95 at Amazon Usually priced around $450, the Garmin Instinct 2X Solar is down to just $289.95 for Amazon's Cyber Monday sale. That's a record low price! This rugged watch provides 24\/7 health and fitness tracking with solar charging support and a built-in LED flashlight. We selected the watch as the #1 best smartwatch for battery life, and now you'll see why.  Thanks to the Garmin watch's hyper-efficient solar panel, the Instinct 2X Solar generally lasts about 40 days on a single charge, even if you're regularly using power-intensive features like dual-band GPS or the built-in LED flashlight. Even at that baseline, the Garmin watch towers over many of its peers, but you could technically enjoy unlimited battery life if you stick with the most basic smartwatch and fitness tracking features. Looking beyond the battery life alone, the Garmin Instinct 2X Solar also boasts military-grade thermal, shock, and water resistance, a ton of health and fitness tracking metrics, and a bright display that's easy to read in any light.      To be sure, this isn't the kind of smartwatch that you'll want to pair with your nicest outfit \u2014 and it's not about to blow you away with the latest AI features \u2014 but if you want something rugged and reliable to take on those long excursions in the great outdoors, the Instinct 2X Solar is one of the most trustworthy wearables on the market. And of course, a record-smashing Cyber Monday discount never hurts. Black Friday has ended and today, December 1st, is officially Cyber Monday! This means that a ton of retailers all across the web are dropping considerable discounts on tech, while others are simply extending their existing Black Friday price drops a little longer. While we might get lucky with a few offers, many of the best deals are certain to expire at midnight tonight. When looking for a great offer to buy before the sales wrap up, keep an eye out for a \"Cyber Monday deal\" stamp on the product page. This will be a good indicator of whether or not the discount is set to expire this evening. And as always, if you're shopping at Amazon, use Camelcamelcamel.com for price history tracking. Sometimes a deal will look really good but will actually be a common occurrence. That's where price tracking comes in handy.

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"Massive discount AND a storage upgrade? Sign me up.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  This is the best time of the year for a multitude of reasons. Not only does family get together to celebrate and watch football, but it also means that Christmas is right around the corner. It also means we're bound to see some steep discounts on some of our favorite devices, like being able to save $700 on the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Most of the time, we don't see very many discounts on Samsung flagship devices once pre-orders have ended. But it seems that we're in luck as this Samsung Cyber Monday deal on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 saves you almost $1,000, AND you'll enjoy get an upgrade to 512GB of storage for FREE. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (512GB): $1,999.99 $1,399.99 at Samsung After kicking off Black Friday by dropping the price a few hundred bucks, Samsung upped the ante by slashing the Galaxy Z Fold 7 price even more AND you'll now get 512GB of storage for the price of the base model.  Price comparison: Best Buy - $1,599 | Amazon - $1,599 For one reason or another, it seems that the latest deal is not immediately appearing for everyone. In that case, we recommend trying different browsers or Incognito Mode in order to get the deal to show up. \u2705Recommended if: You want the latest, greatest, and thinnest foldable that money can buy. \u274cSkip this deal if: You're on a budget, or you would prefer a foldable phone that still includes stylus support. After years of releasing iterative updates to its flagship foldable phone, Samsung went back to the drawing board with the Galaxy Z Fold 7. What we got was the thinnest foldable on the market, and that includes devices released abroad like the Honor Magic V5 or Vivo X Fold 5. While Samsung went in-house with the Exynos 2500 on the Galaxy Z Flip 7, the company stuck with Qualcomm for the Fold 7. As such, we have the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy at the helm, which is paired with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. This top-spec model is also on sale for $600 off as part of the Black Friday festivities. With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, not only did Samsung introduce a completely overhauled design, but we also got a long-overdue camera upgrade. Samsung finally ditched the 50MP wide-angle lens from years past in favor of a 200MP sensor. This is joined by a 12MP ultrawide lens and a 10MP telephoto sensor with a 3x optical zoom. In fact, the 200MP camera is the same sensor that you'll find in the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which is an enormous upgrade. If you're interested in seeing how the Z Fold 7 performs, we compared it to the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. In our review, we gave the Galaxy Z Fold 7 a 4.5\/5 star rating, making this an easy recommendation for anyone who is interested in picking up one of the best foldable phones.

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"The Powerbeats Pro 2 are fantastic earbuds, and you should buy them now.  When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.  Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the best times to get sweet discounts on our favorite tech, and if you're in the market for the best wireless earbuds, then this Powerbeats Pro 2 deal just might be for you. In fact, it's the one product that I actually bought. At $50 off, the Powerbeats Pro 2 drop from $250 to $200. It's not quite as low as we saw during Prime Day, but a sale is a sale, and I simply couldn't wait any longer, especially since I don't know when they'll be on sale again. At a 20% discount, the Powerbeats Pro 2 are a fantastic buy. Save $50 on some rather impressive workout earbuds that work great with Android and better with iPhone. Price check: $199.99 at Best Buy \u2705Recommended if: You're a runner or frequent gym-goer who wants long-lasting earbuds that will stay in place and offer great ANC. \u274cSkip this deal if: You're an Android user who wants access to features like Fast Pair or Google's Find My Device network.      The Powerbeats Pro 2 were easily the closest thing I could find to a replacement for the now-defunct Jabra Elite series. Among the reasons is the presence of physical buttons, something that's not super common on even the best wireless earbuds. I'm not a fan of capacitive buttons, so this is a huge plus for me. In addition to standalone volume buttons, the 'b' buttons can be customized for switching audio modes or triggering your AI assistant. Also, like the Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2, these are built for exercise and other physical activity, making them some of the best fitness earbuds we've tested. The earhooks ensure that they fit extremely well while you're on a run, and you get five eartip sizes so you can get a good seal.      I've had the Powerbeats Pro 2 for a few days now, but so far I'm thoroughly enjoying them. Audio sounds fantastic, and ANC is better than I expected. I also like the transparency mode, as it's easy to activate and makes voices very clear, so I don't have ot take out my earbuds when speaking to others. The battery also lasts a long time, and the charging case adds up to 45 hours of battery life. Oh, and did I mention that it can monitor your heart rate and connect to other apps\/workout equipment? That's right, the Powerbeats Pro 2 have built-in heart rate sensors for better workout tracking, adding even more value to an already-impressive pair of earbuds. I use Android, so the Powerbeats Pro's functionality is somewhat limited, but I still find them a joy to use. However, if you're an iPhone user, there are even more reasons to enjoy them. One of my iPhone-toting friends told me that they preferred these to Apple's AirPods Pro, and I already convinced another friend to purchase them since she does a lot of physical activity. The only thing I don't like about these earbuds is the fact that the charging case is so large. I'd hate to carry these around without a bag or purse to put them in.

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"Apple is expected to launch a new foldable iPhone next year, based on multiple rumors and credible sources. The long-awaited device has been rumored for years now, but signs increasingly suggest that 2026 could indeed be the year that Apple releases its first foldable device. Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.Below, we've collated an updated set of key details that have been leaked about Apple's foldable iPhone so far. Apple will allegedly call the device the \"\u200ciPhone\u200c Fold,\" which is the name the media has already adopted when sharing rumors about the product. Overall Design Book-Style According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple's foldable iPhone is similar in style to Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold, which uses a book-style folding mechanism, rather than the clamshell design of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip. Industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo expects the foldable \u200ciPhone\u200c to measure between 9 and 9.5 mm when folded, and around 4.5 to 4.8 mm when unfolded. More recently, Weibo-based leaker Instant Digital has said that the foldable iPhone will have a thickness of at least 4.8mm. Display Sizes Dual Screens When folded, users will interact with a 5.5-inch outer display that is similar to a typical iPhone screen, while unfolding it will reveal a larger 7.8-inch iPad-style screen. These dimensions have been corroborated by two reputable sources. According to one rumor, the inner folding display will be approximately the size of a piece of A6 paper and will use a 2,713 x 1,920 resolution, while the outer display will use a 2,088 x 1,422 resolution. Crease Visibility 'Crease-Free' The inner display is said to be virtually crease-free, thanks to Apple's use of a metal plate that can disperse and control the stress generated by bending the display, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. Apple is said to be using liquid metal in the hinges to improve durability and help eliminate screen creasing. Liquid metal, manufactured using a die-casting process, has been chosen by Apple to address this common issue with foldable devices, according to the analyst. Citing supply chain sources, Chinese site UDN says that Apple has solved \"the crease problem\" that has plagued most foldable smartphones, and the foldable \u200ciPhone\u200c will be the first crease-free foldable smartphone on the market. Chassis and Hinge Durable Materials The foldable iPhone reportedly has a titanium chassis, with the hinge constructed from a combination of titanium and stainless steel, according to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. The frame itself will use a titanium alloy to prevent bending issues \u2013 a solution that has worked well for Apple's new ultra-thin iPhone Air. However, analyst Jeff Pu believes that Apple is using aluminum and titanium, whereas Kuo believes a mix of stainless steel and titanium has been chosen.  Cameras Front and Rear The foldable iPhone is expected to include a dual-lens rear camera, with a front-facing camera for both folded and unfolded states, according to Kuo. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman recently corroborated reports that the device will have four cameras consisting of one front camera, one inner camera, and two rear cameras. Prolific Weibo-based leaker Digital Chat Station claims that the rear dual lenses will be 48 megapixels each. Other sources have claimed that the inner display features an under-screen camera (USC), while the outer display \u2013\u00a0in the device's folded state \u2013 will have a punch-hole camera. Authentication Touch ID Kuo believes the phone will forgo Face ID authentication, and instead use a Touch ID side button as a means to save precious internal space, and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman recently corroborated the rumor. Apple has previously integrated Touch ID into the side button of the iPad, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Cellular Connectivity C2 Modem The foldable iPhone will use Apple's second-generation C2 modem for cellular connectivity, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Apple debuted its custom-designed C1 modem in the iPhone 16e earlier this year, followed by the C1X featured in the iPhone Air, as part of a multi-year plan to transition away from Qualcomm modems. Gurman says the foldable device will not have a physical SIM slot. Battery Life High-Density Cells Apple is putting a heavy focus on improving power efficiency by slimming down key components like the display driver to make room for more battery cells, according to a Korean blog that has leaked accurate details about unreleased products before. The phone will reportedly use high-density battery cells. Expect the C2 modem to be faster overall, and for it to gain mmWave support in the United States. Further power efficiency improvements are likely too. Color Options Black and White Apple is currently only testing variations of black and white for the folding phone with suppliers, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, although he says that Apple's plans could evolve before the device launches. Pricing Premium Segment Multiple reports have suggested the foldable iPhone will be priced between $2,000 and $2,500 in the United States, which could make it the most expensive iPhone ever. Meanwhile, analysts at investment banking firm UBS and Fubon Research believe the phone will be either between $1,800 and $2,000 or around $2,399, respectively. However, Kuo recently claimed that the hinge is expected to carry an average selling price (ASP) of approximately $70 to $80 when mass production begins \u2013 well below the market expectation of $100 to $120 or higher. Kuo attributed the cost decline to \"assembly design optimization\" and Foxconn's influence in production scaling. Whether the reduction in hinge price will reduce retail price or simply bolster Apple's margins is an open question. Regardless of the price, the foldable is expected to tap into Apple's loyal fanbase, some of whom will view it as a \"must-have device\" if its quality meets expectations. Launch Date Late 2026 According to industry analyst Jeff Pu, the device entered the New Product Introduction (NPI) phase at Foxconn in March 2025, while a November report from Chinese site UDN reported that the device has now entered the engineering validation stage, and Apple is gearing up for mass production. Foxconn is expected to officially start producing Apple's foldable iPhone early in the fourth quarter (October), and a recent report has suggested Apple is already stockpiling components for pre-production. An exact launch date is currently unknown, but both Kuo and Pu say mass production is planned for the second half of 2026. Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman has said he expects the device to be launched next year in the fall season. However, Japan's Mizuho Securities banking firm has suggested a postponement to 2027 could still happen because of Apple taking longer to decide on key design elements such as the hinge.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Lee Givens, Jr., a 57-year-old product manager in Seattle who works at Woven by Toyota, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation. Business Insider has verified his employment with documentation. This essay has been edited for length and clarity. I'd worked at Big Tech companies for more than a decade, but a year ago, I found myself in the middle of a humbling job search. I started working for Microsoft in 2011 as a product manager, but in 2014, I was among thousands of employees who were laid off. I never actually left Microsoft \u2014 I was given 60 days to find a new role internally and successfully moved into a program manager position in a different department. By 2020, my job at Microsoft had become somewhat boring, in part because there was a lot of legal and compliance work. I also thought I needed a new challenge and more money. I left Microsoft for a new opportunity, but looking back, I maybe shouldn't have been so quick to leave. I'm now working at Toyota and am happy with my role, but I had to endure some ups and downs to get here. When I started looking for something new in 2020, Meta was actively recruiting. I decided to leave Microsoft for a product marketing manager role there, where I worked on an augmented reality glasses product. Some of the product plans went awry, and it felt like the team was in disarray. In December 2021, after a little more than a year at Meta, I transitioned to a global product lead role at the software development company Unity. Things didn't ultimately work out there either. As I searched for work in recent years \u2014 and faced a challenging job market \u2014 I sometimes found myself thinking that I shouldn't have left Microsoft. Business Insider has heard from hundreds of job seekers over the past year.\u00a0Share your story, whether you\u00a0found a job\u00a0or are\u00a0still looking, by filling out a form, contacting this reporter via email at jzinkula@businessinsider.com, or via Signal at jzinkula.29. Use a personal email address, a nonwork WiFi network, and a nonwork device; here's our\u00a0guide to sharing information securely. Read more on the topic: Things at Unity seemed promising at first, but as the tech industry shifted toward AI, our researchers began to be poached left and right. We didn't have the budget to keep them happy. I still believed in Unity and really thought it had potential. However, in May 2023, a few days after getting married and honeymooning in Italy, I learned I'd been laid off. This was the third layoff of my career, but it was the first time I had nothing in the pipeline to help me transition to my next role. I decided to take some time to learn as much as I could about AI \u2014 and the basics of how AI frameworks like PyTorch and Modular's MAX worked. My goal was to understand AI so I could better communicate with the engineers working on the technology. I also actively applied for jobs and reached out to recruiters. Apple was one of my top targets, and I applied to every AI-related role I could find at the company. After a few months of job searching, a recruiter contacted me about a contract opportunity at Apple for an engineering program manager role, which I started in September 2023. My contract was extended every three months, and my manager told me that the company was attempting to transition me to a full-time role. It was my understanding that contractors in my group couldn't stay beyond a year, so I figured I'd either be converted or out of a job. As the one-year mark approached, I was told that a senior leader wanted everyone on my team to be based in Cupertino, California, where Apple is headquartered. My understanding was that my chances of landing a full-time role would increase dramatically if I moved to Cupertino. But my wife and I didn't want to leave Seattle. We had recently bought a home in the area, and she had a job there. By the time my contract with Apple ended in September 2024, I had started my next job search. For six months, I had numerous conversations and interviews, and then a lot of \"Nope, you didn't get the job\" messages. I'd never had that problem before. Throughout my career, I had almost never actively sought a job. Most of the jobs I'd had came through friends or recruiters who actively pursued me. It was a humbling experience of putting out hundreds of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and not hearing back. Fortunately, I found some part-time consulting gigs as I looked for work. I'd been good at investing \u2014 doing well enough that I could almost retire \u2014 so I wasn't too worried about cash. My wife also had a fairly high-paying job. Still, we had college expenses for two kids, and my wife was thinking about starting her own business. If we were to make this work financially, I felt I'd have to step up. This motivated me to find a job. I eventually decided to become more open to other opportunities. I started entertaining LinkedIn messages from recruiters I would've previously ignored. One of those messages came from Toyota. The original job was based in Palo Alto, but the company was flexible and agreed to move the role to Seattle. In April, after about two-and-a-half months of interviews, I joined the company as a staff product manager in the company's Woven by Toyota subsidiary. I have a six-figure salary, and my total compensation is much higher than what I was earning at Meta and Apple. I definitely think taking the time to learn more about AI helped me land the job, and that knowledge is driving the main work I'm doing now. One of the biggest takeaways from my career journey is that when there's a major technological shift \u2014 such as the rise of the internet or AI \u2014 you have to reinvent yourself. You need to dive deep into the technology to really understand it. Another lesson: Don't get pigeonholed. I had my heart set on staying at Apple, and I nearly missed out on a great opportunity. Be open to new industries \u2014 it could actually work out. Additionally, don't rush to switch jobs. Before I left Microsoft in 2020, I really clicked there and felt comfortable \u2014 and I think I maybe should've stuck around, even if part of me wanted to try something new. At the same time, leaving Microsoft set me on a path to learning more about AI, which I believe will serve me well in my career. I'm happy with my current role. Toyota's culture, legacy, and focus align closely with my approach to work. The subsidiary I work for is much smaller than Microsoft, Meta, and Apple, which has made it easier for me to make an impact and gain visibility with company leaders. Jump to","label":0}
{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"We may receive a commission on purchases made from links. A good deal is great, but a good deal that's going to help you or a loved one stay active can be even better. It can be incredibly easy to overindulge around the holidays, so having a device that's going to help you stay on track with your fitness goals can be extremely handy to have around. Fortunately, Amazon has an offer that's right in time for the season. Currently, Amazon is offering the Fitbit Versa 4 smartwatch for $119.95, knocking a substantial 40% off the typical $199.95 price tag. There's even a few different color options on this offer: Black\/Graphite, Pink Sand\/Copper Rose, and Waterfall Blue\/Platinum. Additional bands are even included for those with larger or smaller wrists, making this an ideal gift for yourself or for anyone that likes to stay active. Even if it often feels like time can slow down while you're exercising, having a smartwatch with such an extensive focus on your fitness can really be a big influence. While there are plenty of cheap Android smartwatches that users swear by, the Fitbit Versa 4 is also going to be a solid choice for Apple users \u2013- just make sure your iPhone is running iOS 16.4 or higher, whereas Android users will need Android 10 or higher. If you're unsure whether the Fitbit Versa 4 or the Apple Watch is right for you, then Amazon's current offerings may just sway you. Packed with features that will help you stay moving, the Fitbit Versa 4 has a lot to offer for those that wake up early just to get a run in, and it's currently at a price that's hard to beat. Built for those that love to get a workout in every day, the Fitbit Versa 4 includes a Daily Readiness score, which factors your heart rate variability (HRV), resting heart rate (RHR), and your recent sleep to see how well you're going to handle being active for the day. Additionally, the Versa 4 also features GPS, all-day exercise tracking, personalized Sleep Profiles, daily Stress Management, and more. You'll also get a 6-month subscription to Fitbit's premium features, which include more personalized insights and analytics. This is in addition to many of the features you would expect from a smartwatch, including Bluetooth calls and texts, built-in Amazon Alexa, and more. With over 10,000 sales in just the past month on Amazon, the Fitbit Versa 4 has a 4.3-star rating and over 17,200 reviews. Customers give high marks to the smartwatch for its durability, excellent battery life, and impressive health tracking features. If you're looking for a smartwatch with a 6-day average battery life, water resistance up to 50 meters, and support for iOS or Android, the Fitbit Versa 4 at this price is worth a look.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"Electric vehicles are meant to be affordable and accessible, especially when you break down their cost over time. They don't require traditional fuel, often deliver an extended mileage range, and also come with less maintenance. EVs don't have emissions nor do they need oil changes; those are both traits of a traditional gas-powered combustion engine.\u00a0 Oil is used to lubricate mechanical moving parts, for instance, which electric powertrains don't have. But depending on the make and model of the EV, prices vary, just like traditional vehicles. On average, a Nissan, or a Ford is going to cost less than, say, a Mercedes-Benz. Teslas certainly aren't considered cheap when it comes to price, either. If you are looking to upgrade, and remain in the realm of accessible, the good news is that there are indeed some more affordable options. From the Nissan Leaf to the Toyota bZ4X, spanning prices from $29,000 to $38,500 and beyond, here are the four cheapest EVs you can buy today and why you'd want them. The 2026 model Nissan Leaf is mostly a stylish upgrade with its sleek body style, standout accents, intricate wheels, and buzzworthy lighting elements. But this is an electric vehicle so, the real allure would be the 259 to 303 miles of range per charge, EPA estimated. It's also super quiet during a drive and features a classy, upscaled interior, much like you'd expect from a modern vehicle hitting the market with lots of stiff competition. Prices are competitive, too, with the Leaf starting at $29,990 for the S+ trim with $1,495 in destination and handling fees. The next tier up, SV+ starts at $34,230 with 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels and dual 14.3-inch widescreen infotainment displays. Platinum+ starts at $38,990 for larger 19-inch aluminum-alloy wheels with a sleek look, a dimming panoramic roof and Bose advanced audio. While it is a pleasant drive, and Consumer Reports agrees that it shows lots of promise, it also serves as a solid example of why EVs aren't so popular with consumers. Even the cheapest electric vehicle on the market from 2025\u00a0shows lackluster adoption rates. Still, the new model is looking to be quite the upgrade, sure to receive several accolades. It also earned a 9\/10 during Car & Driver's testing\u00a0and delivers on the promise of a bigger, better EV that's a lot of fun to drive. Do note, this is the last year the Nissan Leaf will be available as it's being phased out, so\u00a0the brand can focus on the Ariya it's next-generation of electric offerings. As one of the more affordable EVs available, current year models included, the Hyundai Kona Electric provides a good amount of value. It's a cozy, quiet drive, with an estimated range of 200 to 261 miles per charge, EPA estimated, with front-wheel drive. That's not a big range for long drives, but for commutes and quick trips to the grocery store or around town it'll do just fine.\u00a0Prices start at $32,975 plus\u00a0$1,395 destination and handling fees for the SE model. SEL, N Line and Limited are the other tiers, with the most expensive starting at $41,150, not including the destination fees. Upgrades for the premium trims include heated front seats, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, power driver seat adjustments, roof side rails, Bose premium audio in the N Line and a surround view monitor in the Limited. Ambient lighting really spruces up the interior and brings a futuristic aesthetic to your night drives. One downside with the EV model is that the trunk space is smaller than the gas models. This does limit your storage space, but who's using an EV like this to haul lots of gear, anyway? It also features, arguably, one of the most unique EV styles out there with an iconic grille, boxed front design, snazzy wheels and distinct color options \u2014 check out the Neoteric Yellow in the limited edition model. It's not built for speed and performance, so it's not as fast as some competing EVs like the Nissan Leaf, Volvo EX30, or Kia Niro EV. The trade-off for a more comfortable, long-range drive may be worth it for most, however. Car & Driver scores the 2025 Hyundai Kona Electric an 8\/10 for the year. The Chevrolet Bolt is on hiatus until 2027, which means the 2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV takes the brand's entry-level spot. Additionally, the EV model shares a name with the Equinox SUV, but they are two completely different vehicles. It features an estimated range of 319 miles per charge, EPA estimated with front-wheel-drive. It also has Chevrolet's Super Cruise hands-free highway driving support to take a little stress off routine drives, like a daily commute. Sadly, there's no Android Auto or Apple CarPlay onboard and the cargo space is smaller than gas models, though still capable for any EV at 57 cubic feet with the rear seats folded.\u00a0 Prices begin at\u00a0$33,600 plus $1,395 destination and handling fees for the LT1 trim. The next step up, LT2, starts at $41,900, introducing a front LED light bar and roof rails, wireless phone charging, and heated steering wheel, front seats, and mirrors. The top-end RS trim is $43,400 and up, with a large 17.7-inch touch-screen display, blacked out emblems, mirrors and larger 21-inch wheels. Neither of the upper trim prices include the destination fees. All said and done, it's a zippy little vehicle ideal for those looking to optimize their Point A to Point B drives and shed some of the no-charger-nearby anxieties. Plus, the overall cost is reasonable, comparable to most EVs in its class, and any add-ons or premium trim options you'd want won't break the bank either. Besides the front grill, it's one of the most traditional looking EV models \u2014\u00a0outside of hearing how quiet it runs, you wouldn't really know it's electric by looks alone. The 2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV scores an 8.5\/10 from\u00a0Car & Driver. Built for driving around town and around the city, the Toyota bZ4X features a 222 to 252 mile range per charge, EPA estimated, which is slightly more limited if you're driving long-range or highway miles. It comes in all-wheel-drive (dual motors) and front-wheel-drive (single motor) options and the core aesthetics resemble the Subaru Solterra. Although, the bZ4X's two-tone styling is snazzier.\u00a0 The 2025 bZ4X comes in three trims, starting with the bZ4X XLE\u00a0at $37,070 plus $1,450 destination and handling fees. The next tier,\u00a0bZ4X XLE Nightshade starts at $40,420 for a unique dark-themed exterior, and the\u00a0bZ4X XLE Limited starts at $41,800. As expected, those upper trims prices will also come with additional destination fees. Most of the changes between trims are to the aesthetics, but the XLE adds wireless charging, and extra USB-C ports for devices. Limited offers advanced parking and a 360-degree camera, with optionals like heated seats and an upgraded JBL sound system. Car & Driver scores it a 7.5\/10 and describes it as \"peppy around town,\" promising some great pick-up-and-go for an EV of this caliber. Additionally, the premium trims, XLE, Nightshade, and Limited are quite affordable alongside the base variant. Depending on your budget, that allows you to upgrade to some more eccentric features inside and out without driving up the price too much. The dark-themed Nightshade edition throws some unique styling in the mix, like a black finish to the roof, handles and badging and 20-inch slick wheels. Limited trim adds a 360-degree camera with autonomous parking assistance. All models come with a sizable 12-inch touchscreen display and both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay support.","label":0}

If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been looking to expand the capacity of your PC, Mac, or console, we just spotted a deal that lets you do it for less. Thanks to Cyber Monday, Amazon is offering the Seagate 2TB portable external hard drive at a 19% discount. It usually sits at an already-affordable retail price of $80, but this $15 discount is making the upgrade even more approachable. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s available to all shoppers, whether you have a Prime membership or prefer shopping without it. The only catch? The offer is selling out fast, and it expires tonight. You only have a few more hours left to save, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better to grab yours without wasting more time. Once it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect it to be back at this price anytime soon. See at Amazon Starting off with the capacity; you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting a nice 2TB of additional storage for your device. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enough to offload a bunch of files you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t use as frequently to free some space on your internal storage, plus house all your important data. Think thousands of photos, hundreds of videos, heavy presentations, creative projects, long research papers, and never-ending spreadsheets. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll even be able to throw in some gaming titles. The 2TB capacity is enough for most users who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just want to rely on their internal storage for day-to-day use, but if it feels limited, Seagate is offering plenty of other options at a discount, too. This HDD plays nicely with Windows or Mac computers, and the drag-and-drop functionality lets you transfer files across both with ease. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a traditional hard drive, so the speeds won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be as fast as an SSD, but still not too bad for casual use. Getting started couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be simpler. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preformatted for Windows and Mac, so all that you need to do is connect the drive to your device using the 18-inch USB 3.0 cable. Your device will recognize the HDD automatically, without requiring any specific software installation. It shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take more than a few minutes for it to get up and running! It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also quite portable, which makes it easy to carry your entire digital library of documents and games with you, wherever you go. Just plug it into any computer, and access all the important stuff in seconds. This is great for anyone working remotely, and even for those relying on two devices at the same time. You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t need to transfer files to both your PC and your laptop; the drive does it all. In short, if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been wanting to invest in a storage solution that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s both reliable and easy to carry around, this deal lets you do that for less. On a regular day, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d pay around $80 to enjoy the same features, but Amazon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cyber Monday sale lets you pick the solution up for just $65. If 2TB is more than what you need, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a 1TB option available, too. Creatives looking for more space can consider the 4TB or 5TB versions, or go all out with the massive 8TB or 12TB options. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plenty to choose from, but we highly recommend grabbing yours fast. The deal ends soon, and you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to be disappointed at the very last minute. It\u2019s also a good idea to stock up on anything else you missed grabbing during Black Friday, whether it\u2019s tech gadgets or entertainment upgrades.

Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a word to the wise for parents ready to score a PlayStation 5 on Cyber Monday: If you have more than one kid, or your kid will be hosting friends to show off their new console, it only comes with one controller. So head that screaming fit off at the pass right now, because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also a great Cyber Monday deal at Amazon on the DualSense Wireless Controller. The second controller you need is 27% off for Cyber Monday, landing at $55 \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0just a dollar above its all-time low price. Further advice \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00c2\u00a0controllers are notorious for getting caught up in supply-chain issues, so scoring one now while you can, and at this price, is a must-do if that new PS5 is going to have more than one player on it. Even if not, a spare controller is not the worst idea. See at Amazon The DualSense Wireless Controller isn\u2019t just a remote or a way to play the hundreds of games available on the PlayStation 5. It has a wide range of built-in features that enhance the games instead of just controlling them. Adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, and a built-in microphone that\u2019s essential to online gaming. Games requiring more advanced touch and motion controls are well within the capabilities of the DualSense Wireless Controller too, thank to an integrated touch bad, accelerometer, and gyroscope. Even the familiar and iconic PlayStation controller layout has gotten a little bit of a facelift with this version \u00e2\u0080\u0094 it\u2019s more rounded, and more ergonomically pleasing for longer, more comfortable game play. As games become more advanced and more interactive, the DualSense Wireless Controller is ready. Different weapons give off different haptic feedback and feel with the DualSense when you\u2019re playing compatible shooter games, and the haptics work in unique ways in different games for a better overall experience. The DualSense Wireless Controller is made for the PlayStation 5, but it can also bring its exceptional gaming ability to other devices, including PCs and Macs, via Bluetooth or a USB cable. There are Android and iOS games that can also be played on these controllers. No reason to worry about overuse, either, since the DualSense controllers are rechargeable via USB-C. This Amazon Cyber Monday deal for just $55 is good for a number of the huge variety of colors the PlayStation DualSense Wireless Controller comes in. When you\u2019re clicking, be sure you\u2019re getting the full 27% off deal by choosing one of these: White, Gray Camouflage, Starlight Blue, Edge Midnight Black, or Cosmic Red. All the varieties in stock are on sale, but some may be a few dollars higher in price. The ones that are just $55 are an essential buy if you\u2019re planning on grabbing a PlayStation 5 for Cyber Monday. See at Amazon Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss the latest reviews, news and tips.

It's no longer your mom's AI spaghetti. In just two and a half years, AI video generation has progressed from struggling to depict Will Smith eating spaghetti to producing a lifelike video. The unofficial benchmark test began in 2023 when a Reddit user posted a video of the Academy Award-winner eating spaghetti generated by ModelScope, a text-to-video AI model. The initial results were horrifying. Will Smith looked nothing like his movie star self. Instead, he looked like a bad animation, complete with caricatured features that would be more at home on a tourist trap boardwalk. In some videos, he never actually consumed the spaghetti, failing to meet even the most basic premise of the test. The failures highlighted the early limitations of AI-generated video and images, which sometimes produced people with 8 fingers or other anatomical imperfections. Smith himself referenced the test in February 2024, posting a TikTok in which he ate spaghetti in almost as cartoonish a manner as the initial video. This is getting out of hand! #aivideo #sora  A lot has changed since then, as SkyNews and others have recently pointed out. In 2024, MiniMax, a Chinese AI model, made a much more accurate representation, but AI Smith's chewing was still off. And at the very end of the clip, the noodles appear to levitate. In May, a user posted on X that he used Google's Veo 3 to generate a new video. The problem with this one is that the noodles AI Smith is chewing sound way too crunchy. A later Veo 3.1-generated video looks even more realistic. Will Smith in Veo 3.1 pic.twitter.com\/SuK9jky3NW OpenAI's Sora is widely regarded as the best AI video generator on the market. In fact, it is so good that soon after the launch of Sora 2 and its accompanying TikTok-esque mobile app in September, the company was forced to add more guardrails on third-party likeness and copyrights after a series of high-profile incidents involving SpongeBob and Martin Luther King Jr. Google and Elon Musk's xAI are racing to keep up. In July, xAI launched Grok Imagine, its text-to-video generator. Passing the spaghetti test might be tougher now, as Hollywood and other rights holders intensify their efforts to prevent AI companies from infringing on their rights. Just days before Sora 2's release, Disney, Universal, Warner Bros., and other rights holders filed suit in federal court against MiniMax. Cameo, the personalized video company, sued OpenAI over its decision to name the core feature of the Sora app \"cameos.\" One of the reasons Sora can generate such high-quality videos, especially of non-public figures, is that users can upload facial scans to the app, which is the \"cameo\" feature. In November, a federal judge temporarily blocked OpenAI from using the word \"cameo.\" Meanwhile, in Washington, some lawmakers are appalled that AI can now generate videos of them speaking words that they never once uttered. Not everyone is shying away from AI video. Coca-Cola recently said it once again used AI to help generate its holiday ad, this time drawing on Sora, Veo 3, and Luma AI.  Jump to","label":0}

Schonfeld is adding more firepower to its senior ranks as the firm eyes further expansion in the highly competitive multi-strategy hedge fund space. The NY-based hedge fund, which manages about $17 billion, has hired Andrew Philipp, the chief financial officer of hedge fund giant Citadel and its sister trading firm Citadel Securities, as co-president, according to an internal memo from CEO Ryan Tolkin that was seen by Business Insider. \"Andrew, currently the Chief Financial Officer of Citadel and Citadel Securities, will play a crucial leadership role at the firm as we continue to scale strategically, partnering closely with me, our current President Andrew Fishman and other senior leaders, while also acting as an ambassador to clients, major counterparties and talent,\" the memo, sent to employees Sunday evening, reads. Philipp, 43, is leaving Citadel after four years and will start the new role in September 2026. He will share responsibilities with Fishman, 66, who is staying on as co-president, according to the memo. Fishman joined Schonfeld in 2000 and has been president since 2004. Representatives for Schonfeld and Citadel declined to comment. Philipp's team at Citadel will report to COO Gerald Beeson in the interim until the firm hires a replacement, according to a person familiar with the matter. Beeson previously served as CFO for 18 years, prior to Philipp's arrival. Landing one of the hedge fund industry's top young executives is a win for Schonfeld and marks the latest major C-suite hire as Tolkin aims to fortify the firm's position and better compete with industry heavyweights such as Millennium and Citadel. This summer, Schonfeld hired Michael Grad, former head of business development at BlueCrest, as its chief investment initiatives officer, and Tracy Backofen, a longtime leader at Goldman Sachs, as global head of human capital management. Philipp began his career as a trader at Goldman Sachs, where he spent 16 years, rising to the position of partner and holding titles such as global chief market risk officer and chief risk officer for EMEA. He joined Citadel in 2021. \"His hire is a continuation of our multi-year efforts to enhance the depth and breadth of our senior leadership team, to support the growth and increasing complexity of our business,\" Tolkin said in the memo. Schonfeld's rapid ascent earlier in the decade stalled in 2023, when a string of losses and investor outflows pushed the firm to scale back and briefly weigh a potential tie-up with Izzy Englander's Millennium. Tolkin has long envisioned Schonfeld operating in the same league as Millennium and Ken Griffin's Citadel. The firm regained its footing in 2024, delivering a 19.7% gain in its flagship Partners fund \u2014 outpacing many competitors. The fund was up 1.4% for November and 10% year-to-date, while its Fundamental Equity fund returned 1.7% and 13.6%, respectively, over the same time periods, according to a person familiar with the figures.

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"Affordable option lowers barrier to entry A budget version of the Raspberry Pi 5 single-board computer with 1GB RAM and costing $45 has been announced. The new Raspberry Pi 5 1GB is an affordable option, but it\u2019s not as low-cost as it could\u2019ve been owing to the rocketing cost of memory across the tech industry driven, largely, by demand and competition from the increase in AI data centres. But its lower price comparative to other models in the range is, arguably, never more important.  Why? Because the cost of most other Pi models has risen due to the volatile (heh) memory market with price increase increasing as the amount of memory, er increases \u2013 as this table shows: Yowch\u2014$145 for a Raspberry Pi 5 with 16GB tastes pretty sour, but keeping a sub-$50 version of its best-performing model on the table is welcome. Yet annoying as price increases increasingly are, Raspberry Pi say they\u2019re required to \u201chelp us to secure memory supplies\u201d amidst fierce competition for chips from other companies.  Not everyone intends to use their Raspberry Pi as a desktop computer. While the \u201cmore RAM = better\u201d mindset is not without merit, the lower price of the 1GB model lowers the barrier of entry to doing cool things with robotics, coding, etc using a Pi 5. Smaller boards (Zero, CM5 etc) may be more versatile (and cheaper) but they often lack full-size USB ports, GPIO headers and the\u00a0CSI\/DSI\u00a0and PCIe connectors.  The 1GB Pi 5 caters to those who need the Pi 5 performance \u2014 its\u00a0quad-core Arm Cortex-A76 processor is 2-3x faster than the Raspberry Pi 4 \u2014 in a SBC form factor and at an affordable price. Not all Pi models see their price rise (owing, I\u2019d imagine, to plenty of existing stock).  The Raspberry Pi 4 1GB is still sold at $35, and the Raspberry Pi 4 2GB costs $45 \u2013 the same price as this entry-level Pi 5.  Older models, like the Raspberry Pi 3+ and many smallest-board offerings (like the Pi Zero) are similarly unaffected \u2013 choice, ahoy! The upside to the downside of most Raspberry Pi\u2019s costing more than they did yesterday is that the company making them anticipate that the underlying reason (memory demands) is \u201ctemporary\u201d. \u201cWe remain committed to driving down the cost of computing and look forward to unwinding these price increases once it abates,\u201d they add. You can buy the Raspberry Pi 5 1GB from approved resellers from today, though depending on your location there may be some some minor stock shortages as inventory filters out.

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"ByJohn Choong, Contributor. Despite some recent consolidation, the Sainsbury\u2019s share price seems to have finally broken free of its 300p ceiling on the back of its interim results. In fact, I believe the stock has more room to run. Sainsbury\u2019s had a relatively good half. The retailer saw its revenue grow 2.8% to \u00a317.58 billion. Absent fuel sales, which fell 11.3% to \u00a31.94 billion, retail sales were up a whopping 4.8%. This was driven by grocery revenue growing 5.3% to \u00a312.79 billion. The company has been reallocating and expanding more store space towards food from its \u2018Food First\u2019 strategy \u2013 and it\u2019s working \u2013 with its highest H1 market share in 5 years. In general merchandise (GM), General Merchandise & Clothing (GMC) recorded sales growth of 3.3% to \u00a3804 million. This was thanks to good weather and continued strong momentum from its clothing line, Tu, as revenue grew by 7.8%. GM itself, however, remained a drag. This was the case with Argos, too, where sales increased 2.3% to \u00a31.98 billion. However, financial services (FS) revenue did leap 14.0% to \u00a365 million. Sainsbury\u2019s bottom line turned out better than expected. Despite cost headwinds, the firm\u2019s underlying operating profit margin still ticked up 11 basis points to 2.88%. This allowed underlying operating profit to rise 6.8% to \u00a3506 million. And although underlying net finance costs were broadly stable from last year at \u00a3166 million, share buybacks spurred underlying diluted earnings per share (EPS) to jump 12.1% to 10.2p. Therefore, it was perhaps not a surprise to see management upgrade their outlook for the year slightly. It now expects retail underlying operating profit to surpass the \u00a31.00 billion it had initially guided for. Additionally, the board committed to a progressive dividend policy, which will be music to shareholders\u2019 ears, especially after declaring an 11.0p per share special dividend from its banking operations sale worth \u00a3250 million. This will complement the 5.1% increment to Sainsbury\u2019s interim dividend of 4.1p, given the fact that the group\u2019s dividends have stagnated in recent years. The team also mentioned that the disposals from its bank sale will be more than expected, at \u00a3400 million. As such, it plans to use the remaining \u00a3150 million for share buybacks \u2013 an additional \u00a350 million for the remainder of FY26 and the other \u00a3100 million for FY27. To sweeten the deal, CFO Bl\u00e1thnaid Bergin assured investors on the earnings call that a bigger buyback can be expected next year, with \u00a3300 million. This is the basis of my bullish thesis, and is probably the reason why the Sainsbury\u2019s share price has reacted as favourably as it has been in a while \u2013 larger dividends and buybacks will enrich shareholder returns, and thereby Sainsbury\u2019s investment case. But shareholder returns prospects aside, there seems to be sufficient evidence to suggest that bigger returns are possible. This is because despite Sainsbury\u2019s inflating its grocery prices behind the market, it still managed to grow both its volume and value market shares. This indicates that the volume uplifts have resulted in higher sales, with more customers shopping with bigger baskets. Moreover, despite a largely deflationary and disinflationary GM market, both GMC and Argos have shown relatively decent momentum and improvement. These have had a positive impact on margins. And with more store retrofits and reallocation towards higher-profitability food spaces to come, the future looks bright, as value and quality perceptions continue to improve, with scores ahead of its competitors. Despite that, downside risks remain to an extent. Particularly, the recent Budget, ridden with tax hikes has weighed on consumer sentiment. This could depress consumer discretionary spending in the short term, resulting in inventory bloating and markdowns, thereby impacting profits. Still, I think the Sainsbury\u2019s share price is well positioned to overcome the short-term noise with its promising business prospects.","label":0}

Amazon blew away Black Friday price expectations by lowering the price of the Fitbit Charge 6 to an all-time low, and this made high-end fitness tracking suddenly affordable for everyone. The big store decided to match that big discount for Cyber Monday and shows that it really wants to take over the fitness tracker market this holiday season. The Charge 6 is a slim wristband that doesn\u2019t look like a fitness tracker like bigger smartwatches and it has accurate heart rate monitoring, built-in GPS, Google app integration, and full health tracking. Right now, Amazon has this fitness powerhouse on sale for $99, down from its usual price of $159 (which is a new record low). See at Amazon The Charge 6 has the best heart rate monitoring of any Fitbit ever made, and it has better optical sensors and smarter algorithms that get rid of motion artifacts. That level of accuracy is important because the tracker can now send your heart rate directly to gym equipment that works with it via Bluetooth. This means you don\u2019t have to wear chest straps like many cardio machines do for heart rate training programs. The built-in GPS keeps track of your outdoor runs, walks, and bike rides with the same level of accuracy as dedicated running watches. The Fitbit Charge 6\u2019s touchscreen interface lets you control YouTube Music, navigate Google Maps and make payments with Google Wallet right from your wrist. That ecosystem connection makes the tracker a useful everyday device instead of just a workout buddy. You can switch songs while you run, get turn-by-turn directions to new places, or pay for coffee without taking out your wallet. Comprehensive health tracking goes beyond just counting steps as it also keeps an eye on heart rate variability, blood oxygen levels while you sleep, changes in skin temperature, and stress management through guided breathing exercises. Zone of Activity Minutes count how long you spend in high heart rate zones during workouts, so you get credit for intensity as well as duration. With normal use, like 24\/7 heart rate monitoring, daily GPS workouts, and notification sync, the battery lasts about seven days. This means you don\u2019t have to charge it every night like most smartwatches do. You can track your sleep every night without worrying about the battery dying because it lasts for a week. You only need to remember to charge it once a week. The slim design fits comfortably under shirt cuffs and doesn\u2019t get caught on clothes or make pressure points when worn all day. Smart notifications keep you connected by showing calls, texts, and app alerts on the color touchscreen of the tracker. However, the only way to respond on Android devices is with quick replies. In addition to fitness features, calendar alerts, weather updates, and timer functions make the device useful every day. The Fitbit app lets you sync the device wirelessly with both iOS and Android phones and it also has detailed analytics, trend tracking, and social features that let you compete with friends through challenges. When you think about how much similar fitness trackers cost (between $150 and $200 without Google integration or heart rate broadcasting from gym equipment) getting the Fitbit Charge 6 for $99 is a great deal. For less than $100, you can get a tracker that will help you train smarter, learn more about your body, and stay in touch all day long.

One of the biggest and best Cyber Monday PC deals at Amazon is on one of the smallest PCs on the market. The ACEMAGIC M1 Mini PC, loaded with an Intel Core i9 processor, 32GB of RAM, a 1TB hard drive, and Windows 11 Pro, is a fat 38% off right now. Normally an $800 mini PC, the sale price of $500 is the lowest yet. The idea that mini PCs are gimmicky pocket-sized devices that come at a fraction of the size and a fraction of the performance of their full-sized counterparts has been fading away with every new release, but the ACEMAGIC M1 might be the one that puts it away for good. With a max speed of nearly 5GHz and an ample supply of memory and storage, along with support for up to three 4K displays, there are no limitations on what the ACEMAGIC M1 can do. See at Amazon Place the ACEMAGIC at the center of your workstation, surrounded by three 4K displays and hooked up to a fast Internet connection, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re off and running. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re editing videos or hi-res photos, coding, tackling hardcore spreadsheets and data processing, or anything else you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d use a full-sized tower PC for. You can even devote one of those screens to streaming or gaming while you work \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the ACEMAGIC M1 is up to the task. It all starts with the Intel i9-11900H octo-core processor that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a massive upgrade over the i7 and i5 versions that are still commonly found at the heart of brand-new PCs. It can blast away at full power without overheating even in the tiny chassis of the ACEMAGIC M1, thanks to the advanced cooling system that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in place \u00e2\u0080\u0094 dual air ducts and cooling fins, copper pipe for superior heat dissipation, and a high-speed fan that runs in nearly total silence.\u00c2\u00a0 The superefficient fan means less power consumption on top of lower temperatures, and it makes the ACEMAGIC M1 a viable option for 24\/7 duties like being a fulltime media server, or for huge downloads or other background tasks that can run while you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re sleeping. Needless to say, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarkably easy to find a home for a PC that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just under 6.5 inches square and 4.5 inches thick, weighing a whisker under 3 pounds. Even if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re utilizing most of not all of its huge array of connection ports, it can be placed virtually anywhere \u00e2\u0080\u0094 even behind a monitor or big-screen TV with the included VESA mount.\u00c2\u00a0 Cyber Monday is the day when tech deals fly fast and furious, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easy to get lost in that hailstorm of numbers and percentages and offers. Do yourself a favor and bookmark this one, because this Amazon deal taking 38% off the price of the ACEMAGIC M1 Mini PC is going to be very difficult to beat.

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":" This article is part of Kotaku Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.       We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site.      Cyber Monday is almost over, and tomorrow morning all the discounts will be gone as Amazon prices go back to normal. Today is your last chance to get deals on useful tech that you\u2019ll use every day and power banks are some of the most useful things you can own. For instance, this INIU 10,000mAh 45W model is now one of the top five best-selling power banks in its category, and it has dropped from its usual price of $21 to just $17. This ultra-slim battery pack fixes the common problem of phones dying in the middle of the day when you\u2019re not near an outlet: It does this with 45W Power Delivery charging which is faster than most other portable chargers and the dual USB-C port setup (and one additional USB-A port) lets you use the same type of connection for both input and output. See at Amazon INIU made a unique high-density battery cell that holds 10,000mAh in a shape that is 30% smaller and 15% lighter than standard power banks with the same amount of power. This smaller size is very important for everyday use because the difference between a power bank that fits comfortably in a jacket pocket and one that makes an awkward bulge will make you decide whether or not to bring it with you. The slim shape fits into bags, purses, and even tight jeans pockets without adding the heavy weight of a brick that makes you think twice about carrying extra batteries. The 45W Power Delivery chip charges phones at speeds that are equal to or faster than what most phone makers include in the box: It can charge an iPhone 16 to 60% in about 25 minutes. Because it can be refilled quickly, you can charge it during short breaks instead of having to wait hours while it slowly charges which makes the power bank useful in emergencies when you need power right away. Only about 5% of power banks on the market actually use the dual USB-C port design correctly: Most portable chargers need you to use a separate micro-USB or proprietary port to charge the battery itself which means you have to carry an extra cable just for the power bank. With INIU\u2019s method, you can use the same USB-C cable to charge both your phone and the battery pack. This ability to charge three devices at once is useful when you\u2019re out with a group and everyone needs power, or when you have a phone, wireless earbuds and a smartwatch that all need charging during the day. The ports intelligently distribute power based on device requirements and avoids overcharging or voltage mismatches that could damage sensitive electronics. This power bank is small and light enough to meet TSA requirements for carry-on luggage and its 10,000mAh capacity is the perfect balance between usefulness and portability Some of the safety features are protection against overcharging, short circuits, and temperature monitoring that stops the battery from getting too hot when it\u2019s charging quickly. These protections are especially important when charging at high wattages because they keep the cells from getting stressed and damaged, which makes the power bank last longer. This 10,000mAh power bank with 45W charging and three USB-C\/A\u00c2\u00a0 is a great deal at $17 as models with similar specs that are cheaper usually cost $30 to $40. Cheaper options either don\u2019t support fast charging or use older micro-USB input ports, which means you have to keep old cables. This is the last chance to get a really useful accessory at a clearance price before it goes back to regular retail tomorrow. The Cyber Monday sale ends tonight.

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"It took close to a year for the first Android XR device to come to market after it was announced back in 2024. And the interesting part is that it didn't even come directly from Google. Instead, Samsung proudly announced the Galaxy XR headset, promising a new Android experience for consumers.  And while the initial response was pretty good, we don't see many people going out and buying this $1,800 product. And that's fine, because most tech enthusiasts know that this is just a stepping stone. And while it will take some time before you see this technology land at a price that everyone can afford, Google is now ready to share more news about the OS at a special Android XR event. Google posted a new video on its Android Developers YouTube channel, which promises to shed light on the operating system, its features, and potentially new hardware (9to5Google). While we doubt we'll see new products announced, we should get a better feel of what to expect with upcoming and current hardware thanks to new updates.  This isn't going to be a huge event like Google I\/O, and will be much smaller and shorter, with 9to5Google sharing that it will only be a 30-minute presentation. You'll be able to enjoy the event on December 8, and Google will even give you the option to set a reminder in Google Calendar and YouTube so you won't miss it.  As stated before, Android XR is just starting out, so we don't expect to hear anything groundbreaking at this upcoming event. And while it might not even be a necessary product and ecosystem to develop right now, Google couldn't just let a rival like Apple dominate the space. Apple's Vision Pro headset isn't exactly flying off the shelves, despite all the hype it generated ahead of release.  However, Apple's product is substantially more expensive, coming in with a starting price of $3,500. And while there were plans for a more affordable model, rumors suggest that the project has been canceled. While wearing a computer on your head might not catch on, there is promise with new smart glasses that are just starting to hit the market.  Not everyone will agree that these are the future, but there does seem to be more hope when compared to the headsets we're seeing from Samsung and Apple. Maybe we'll get to see something like this running Android XR at the December 8 event? We'll just have to tune in to find out.  We want to hear from you!

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"High-profile deep tech companies like Anthropic and Boston Dynamics are looking to scale their businesses within the industrial field with strategic partnerships. The next big AI transformation will be on warehouse floors and within industrial field operations as AI deployment brings automation to the world\u2019s 2.7 billion deskless workers.  A study published today (1 December) by MIT\u2019s Center for Transportation and Logistics, drawing on responses from over 2,000 supply chain and warehousing professionals across 21 countries, found that over half surveyed report operating at advanced or fully automated maturity levels, especially among larger businesses with complex multi-site logistics networks.                                  The gold standard of business intelligence.                                                                   Find out more                                                       Experience unmatched clarity with a single platform that combines unique data, AI, and human expertise.                            Find out more                          The MIT study also found most companies dedicate 11%-30% of their warehouse technology budgets to AI and machine-learning initiatives, with the ROI period averaging two to three years. In the wider field operations market, AI adoption is being driven by technology advances that have enabled effective prediction maintenance for operational efficiency, a shift to physical AI driven by advances in robotics and connectivity which are streamlining industrial and manufacturing production, the deployment of machine vision systems for a more granular control of operations and, advances in digital twin technology for optimising processes. The MIT report cites human job displacement fears as one of the greatest barriers to adoption. More than three-quarters of surveyed organisations saw a rise in employee productivity and satisfaction after implementing AI tools, and over half reported growing the size of their workforce.  The positive employee survey results, along with the emergence of new roles including AI\/ML engineers, automation specialists, process-improvement experts, and data scientists, reflect the most common industry narrative used to address job displacement fears.  Don\u2019t let policy changes catch you off guard. Stay proactive with real-time data and expert analysis. Businesses on the frontier edge of AI, now entering the industrial sector, will be beneficiaries of a market opportunity that is set to reach $90.28bn by 2033 from $20.02bn in 2024 growing at a CAGR of 18.6%, according to some estimates. On Nov 13, Industrial AI company IFS announced partnerships with Anthropic, Boston Dynamics Siemens and 1X signalling a wider trend for some of today\u2019s most innovative AI and robotics companies setting their sights on industrial AI as the next frontier for scaling their technology. The partnerships were announced at IFS\u2019s Industrial X Unleashed conference in New York, where CEO Mark Moffat noted the vast sums of up to $10tn being spent on rebuilding the industrial world with AI. But the gap between this massive capital investment and the practical application of AI into industrial processes is just beginning in earnest, according to Moffat. The partnerships demonstrate a shift towards AI integration \u201ccoming out from behind the desk\u201d to serve the majority of the global workforce operating within industrial settings, says IFS chief product officer Christian Pederson. As one of Europe\u2019s rare unicorns, the privately held $16bn Swedish company, headquartered in London, is pursuing partnerships with headline-grabbing deep tech companies like Anthropic and Boston Dynamics. But away from the headlines, a quiet AI revolution is happening as the industrial sector seeks to harness frontier AI for wholesale workflow automation.  The IFS Boston Dynamics collaboration focuses on serving industries where field operations are critical, including manufacturing, energy, utilities, mining, and other asset-intensive sectors. The partnership aims to unlock value in field operations, an area underserved by generic AI applications, says Pederson. \u201cIt means that what we think of as digital workers can now do physical things. They are not only creating a work order for someone but they\u2019re sending instruction to a robot to do the work for them,\u201d Pederson told Verdict. Pederson proffers that the white-collar nature of the technology industry itself and the mindset of its leaders, has meant that it has, naturally, hitherto focused on non-industrial areas. Pederson notes that from a product perspective, AI has, in general, reached a level of quality with a lower hallucination rates that should allow for the wholesale deployment of AI into industrial field processes. Unlike white collar enterprise AI, industrial settings require hundred percent accuracy. \u201cIn the industrial world, any hallucination means people will die,\u201d explains Pederson. IFS and its AI partners demonstrate what NexusBlack CEO Kriti Sharma considers an underserved area and the one area where AI has actually been underhyped. IFS launched its AI lab, NexusBlack, in April this year to address critical infrastructure use cases with predictive analytics for maintenance and continuity planning. The company\u2019s new tool, Resolve, is built on Anthropic\u2019s Claude models and benefits from IFS\u2019s strategic acquisition, earlier this year, of agentic AI company TheLoops. Physical AI \u2013 the confluence of robotic hardware, advanced connectivity and AI \u2013 has the potential to provide an \u201cinfinite workforce\u201d and solve some of the world\u2019s most difficult industrial challenges, according to Sharma. The NexusBlack team take the physical nature of their work seriously and are often, quite literally, living in aircraft hangers or sleeping on the production line floors of their customers\u2019 industrial facilities. These are not the technology rollouts that most technology professionals have been accustomed to in their air-conditioned offices. Pederson says some of the partnerships that bridging some of the \u201chottest\u201d AI companies with those within the industrial field in a more asset-based setting are based on knowledge transfer. Anthropic, for example, is not used to working in an industrial setting and IFS can help the company train its models on industry relevant data and scenarios.  Applied AI Leader at Anthropic, Garvan Doyle, says there\u2019s a broad set of steps the company takes to prioritise who with and where it works. \u201cIt\u2019s based on our global footprint. It\u2019s based on the different segments we operate in. It\u2019s a pretty multi-factor step, but we try ensuring that we\u2019re scaling our teams with thought,\u201d he says. And while industrial AI has been deployed for some time, the market is at a critical juncture, says Vijay Guntur, CTO and head of ecosystems at HCLTech. Guntur cites the rapid advancement of AI platforms, combined with the increased availability of powerful simulation, robotics, and edge-compute technologies, means enterprises are finally able to bridge the gap between digital models and real-world deployment. Manufacturing, logistics, energy, utilities, mining, and hi-tech, are all areas where digital twins, autonomous systems, and AI-driven automation create substantial improvements in productivity, resilience, and sustainability. These autonomous systems connecting the physical and digital worlds mean industrial facilities running preventative maintenance scheduling, predictive failure analysis and automated anomaly detection. Workers out in the field can feed data back to enterprise systems, triggering autonomous decision making and action at source, as well as sending instructions for action required in the field, all within a single integrated platform. Guntur says that notably, edge inference has become dramatically more affordable, removing a major barrier to deployment, with cost-per-inference at the edge dropping by 4x-20x over the past two years thanks to hardware leaps. On 17 November, HCLTech launched a physical AI innovation lab in collaboration with US chipmaker Nvidia in Silicon Valley. The lab in Santa Clara, California, will help enterprises explore, incubate and scale industry physical AI and cognitive robotics applications. Integrated with HCLTech\u2019s global AI Lab network, the dedicated facility will combine the Nvidia technology stack and its core platforms with HCLTech\u2019s set of physical AI solutions. Guntur says of HCL\u2019s Nvidia partnership and its timing \u2013 along with other leading partnerhips in the space \u2013 that it really does signal the beginning of a new era for industrial AI adoption. \u201cThe convergence of mature AI hardware\/software stacks, the pressing need for smarter and more sustainable operations, and growing enterprise confidence in digital transformation are all driving the wider take-off of physical right now.\u201d Guntur says that the drive for organisations to stay competitive will mean many more collaborations within the area of industrial AI which he says will take the form of collaborative ecosystems like the HCL\/Nvidia lab and IFS\u2019s Nexus Black, adding: \u201cThey are emerging as key enablers for real-world breakthroughs in automation, safety, and operational intelligence.\u201d                     The gold standard of business intelligence.

The Collector's Edition comes with a terrarium diorama, a steelbook case, and more extras. By      Steven Petite    on December 1, 2025 at 7:48AM PST   The Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater Collector's Edition is on sale for 50% off at Amazon for Cyber Monday. The $100 discount is only available for the PS5 edition of the Collector's Edition. This deal probably won't remain in stock for long.   The Snake Eater remake's Collector's Edition comes with a bunch of physical extras, including a Terrarium Diorama and exclusive steelbook case. The diorama recreates a scene from the game's first mission, and the steelbook has Yoji Shinkawa's artwork from the original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Here's everything you get with the Collector's Edition:   Metal Solid Delta's Tactical Edition was discounted to $30 for PS5 and Xbox Series X for Black Friday. Unfortunately, this deal is sold out for both console platforms at Amazon and Walmart. If you're lucky, you may still be able to order a copy online and pick it up at your local Walmart. The Tactical Edition includes a voucher with codes for the Sneaking DLC Pack ($15 value) and White Tuxedo Outfit. The massive $40 discount was by far the best price since the Snake Eater remake launched in late August. Before Walmart's sale started, the lowest price was $50. The PS5 version of the Tactical Edition is currently going for $50 at Amazon and Best Buy. It's worth emphasizing that the Tactical Edition is technically a launch edition. At some point, whenever retailers sell through their inventories, the next batch of physical copies will likely be standard editions without the Sneaking DLC voucher in the box. Sneaking DLC Pack: The Sneaking DLC Pack comes with 10 cosmetic items, including suits that pay homage to Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, two \"naked\" uniforms, and even a suit that turns Snake into a crocodile. Here's the full list: The voucher in the box has a separate code for the White Tuxedo, which was originally framed as a preorder bonus. PC players can save 45% on the standard edition Steam key at GameSpot sister site Fanatical. The discount drops the price of Metal Gear Solid Delta to $38.49. Unfortunately, the Sneaking DLC Pack is only included with the Digital Deluxe Edition on PC, which is priced at $60 (was $80) right now.

T-Mobile's Cyber Monday sale is live, and while most of the best deals involve a good bit of fine print, you could score some serious savings if you play your cards right. One of the best offers I've seen today is a mouthful: trade in an eligible device, regardless of condition, and add a line with the Experience Beyond plan and T-Mobile will hook you up with a free Galaxy Z Flip 7, Galaxy Tab S10 FE 5G, AND the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. Of course, nothing is ever really free with carrier deals, and you'll still need to pay for the service line of each device you claim. The \"free\" part comes from the retail value: all together, these devices would cost over $2,000. This Cyber Monday T-Mobile deal makes it so you aren't paying any of that. Another nice part of the deal is that you don't have to claim all three devices to get them for free. Simply want the phone and the watch? You got it. Just the tablet? Done. The only requirement is that you grab the Z Flip 7 at minimum. After that, the choice is yours. The Ultimate Samsung Bundle: Over $2,000 of Galaxy devices for FREE with eligible trade-in and Experience Beyond plan at T-Mobile Trade in an old or broken phone and add a line with the Experience Beyond and T-Mobile will give you a Galaxy Z Flip 7 deal for free. From that point, you can add a Galaxy Tab S10 FE, the Watch 8 Classic, and a pair of Buds  3 FE to your cart and get ALL of the devices for free, you just have to pay for the qualified service lines. Hoping for a Samsung Christmas? T-Mobile just granted your wish.  Like I mentioned above, you'll need to sign up for the Experience Beyond plan to be eligible for the deal. This top-rated unlimited plan gives you unlimited talk, text, and premium data on T-Mobile's legendary 5G network, plus you'll get an unlimited mobile hotspot, free subscriptions to popular streaming services (including Netflix, Hulu, and Apple TV Plus), and coverage in over 215 countries worldwide. Starting at $100 per month for a single line (with AutoPay and before any taxes are applied), the T-Mobile Experience Beyond plan is as expensive as it is sweet. Fortunately, you can drop that price considerably by adding multiple lines and taking advantage of the AutoPay discount. And then there's the value of the free devices. But what's included in the Ultimate Samsung Galaxy Bundle at T-Mobile? \ud83d\udd25Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 (retail value - $1,099.99): The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is one of the best clamshell devices on the market today, with two vibrant AMOLED displays, a powerful Exynos chipset, and all of the latest AI-boosted software features.

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"Happy Monday! It's December 1, 2025, and this is The Morning Shift \u2014 your daily roundup of the top automotive headlines from around the world, in one place. This is where you'll find the most important stories that are shaping the way Americans drive and get around. In this morning's edition, we're looking at automakers' enthusiasm for unproven AI, as well as the one nation on Earth that still likes Tesla. We'll also look at Stellantis and Germany teaming up in favor of climate change, and European countries that want to shift their supply chains away from China.\u00a0 Ford and Hyundai are investing in AI, but it's not quite the ChatGPT we're all used to. Instead, the automakers are hoping to use AI to up their quality, and reduce the amount they spend on recalls. From Automotive News: Automakers are pouring billions into artificial intelligence-powered factory systems, promising better quality and fewer recalls, but the technology's payoff remains unclear. Ford and Hyundai have led the industry in deploying AI manufacturing systems, touting the technology's potential to catch defects before vehicles reach customers. Improving quality and reducing recalls is of crucial importance for Ford. The Dearborn, Mich., automaker has already set a full-year U.S. recall record and is on pace to lead the industry in callbacks for the fourth time in five years. The company reported spending $450 million on warranty expenses during the third quarter of this year. But Ford is looking to continue reducing the warranty costs and recall numbers and has touted AI as a potential solution. \"The goal is to design a product that can't be installed wrong, that can't go through the process incorrectly,\" Jeff Tornabene, a technology manager for Ford's Manufacturing Technology and Development Center, told Automotive News in a July 6 interview about the company's AI systems. Artificial intelligence, as we know it, is actually very good at pattern recognition \u2014 this is why it\u00a0works well in the medical world, despite how terrible it is at generating text. That pattern recognition may well be useful in building cars, to determine if something went wrong with an established process (say, a tired worker sent a car through their station too quickly, without taking the time to properly fasten bolts)\u00a0but it's not likely to cure all recalls. Especially all of Ford's recalls, of which there are many.\u00a0 Pretty much every country on Earth has soundly rejected Tesla in recent months and years, with the automaker's sales dwindling as its executive suite shifts focus from \"updating its many-years-old vehicles\"\u00a0to \"spreading white supremacist conspiracy theories on Twitter,\"\u00a0but there's an exception:\u00a0Norway, apparently, is pretty fine with suspensions as stiff as Elon's right arm. From Reuters: Tesla registrations in several key European markets plunged in November from a year earlier as the U.S. EV maker continued to struggle to stem market share losses despite rolling out new versions of its best-selling Model Y. Norway however bucked the trend with record sales in the month. The country, Tesla's first market outside of North America more than a decade ago, has been the company's second biggest European market after Britain so far this year. Monthly registrations, a proxy for sales, slumped by 58% in France\u00a0to 1,593 vehicles sold, by 59% to 1,466 cars in Sweden, by 49% to 534 cars in Denmark, by 44% in the Netherlands to 1,627, and by 9% in Spain to 1,523, official data showed. But in Norway, they almost trebled to 6,215 cars, beating the country's annual sales record with one month to spare. Norway's enthusiasm for Tesla cars is probably entirely unrelated to the fact that the United Nations has called the country out for racial prejudice. I assume these are just two facts that happen to both exist with absolutely zero connective tissue.\u00a0 Much of Germany's economy comes from the country's automaking endeavors. Much of Stellantis' market cap is based on sales of Jeeps and Rams. The two are natural allies against causes like \"breathable atmosphere on the only planet we know can sustain life,\"\u00a0because what's a habitable biosphere matter when you could have quarterly profits? It makes perfect sense that, now, Germany and Stellantis have teamed up to push back against EU emissions regulations. From Reuters: Stellantis Chief Executive Antonio Filosa on Monday welcomed Berlin's call to soften European Union car emissions rules, saying Germany's proposals aligned with industry demands to revive growth in the struggling sector. The European Commission is due to unveil proposals for a package to support the auto sector on December 10, including for a review of carbon-emission targets amid mounting pressure from governments and manufacturers to be more flexible and allow plug-in hybrids and new fuel-powered cars beyond 2035. \"We welcome the German government's support for revisions to the European regulations,\" Filosa said in a statement, adding it built on auto lobby ACEA's package of proposals, \"all of which are urgently needed to return the European auto industry to growth\". German Chancellor Friedrich Merz last week urged Brussels to allow exemptions for plug-in hybrids and highly efficient combustion engines, arguing that automakers need more flexibility as they battle slow electric-vehicle uptake and fierce competition from China. Yes, the planet got destroyed. But for a beautiful moment in time we created a lot of value for shareholders. Recently, China locked down exports on chips from Nexperia, which sent automakers scrambling. Now those companies fear the Chinese government could do so again for other products, and they're taking steps to avoid such problems in the future \u2014 mainly, by diversifying supply chains away from China. From Reuters: China's tightening export controls are pushing European firms to explore new supply chain capacity outside of the world's second-largest economy, a European lobbying group said on Monday, seeking cover from the U.S.-China trade war. The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said one in three member companies was looking to shift sourcing away from China due to Beijing's export control regime, with 40% of its flash survey's respondents reporting that the commerce ministry is processing export licences more slowly than promised. \"China's export controls have increased the uncertainty felt by European businesses operating in the country, with companies facing the risks of production slowdowns or even stoppages,\" said Jens Eskelund, the chamber's president. The curbs have \"added more pressure to a global trade system that was already under a great deal of stress,\" he added. Some 130 companies participated in the survey, the chamber said, which counts German automakers BMW\u00a0and Volkswagen, Finnish telecommunications maker Nokia and French oil major TotalEnergies as members. China has locked down exports on chips and magnets, but no one's sure what comes next. Sounds like we're in the age of just messing with international trade for no real reason, and hurting every nation in the process. I\u00a0wonder what country started that.\u00a0   Everyone knows the elementary school version of the story, where Rosa Parks was tired and didn't want to stand to make room for a white passenger. Parks was tired, yes, but not just physically \u2014 she was tired of Jim Crow laws, and had long been an activist against them. Civil rights groups in Alabama at the time had been looking for a flashpoint around which to act against bus segregation laws, and Parks was part of those discussions. She knew what she was doing, she knew her rights, and she knew her actions would lead to the Montgomery Bus Boycott. Do a bit of research into the civil disobedience that fueled the civil rights movement, and you'll find a lot of it was more educated, more organized, and more planned than you were taught as a kid. It takes organization to change things. Get in touch with the organizations looking to change things around you.\u00a0 Picture this.","label":0}

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"Legal tech has had a breakout year for VC funding, which reached $3.2 billion in 2025. As the sector attracts investment, questions remain about a bubble and real revenue gains. Meanwhile, law firms are exploring ways to utilize AI to deliver better and faster service. For many lawyers, 2025 was the year when using AI became mandatory. Law firm leaders and general counsels moved the tech from pilots to production, standardizing research and drafting copilots while expanding innovation teams and training junior lawyers. That demand fueled investment in a new crop of startups across contract review, corporate due diligence, predictive analytics, and more. Buzzy legaltech startups like Harvey and Legora pulled in bigger checks, as incumbents from LexisNexis to Clio made aggressive moves to keep pace. Funding for legal companies hit $3.2 billion this year, according to Business Insider's analysis of Crunchbase data and recent financings. Valuations on some names have prompted bubble talk, but buyer demand would suggest there's at least real revenue beneath the hype. This year, Business Insider had the inside track on legal tech companies raising money. Read on for our coverage of some of 2025's most notable deals. Legora CEO Max Junestrand said the company wasn't actively seeking funding last spring, but still, the offers flooded in. \"I don't think it's a secret that things have been really working,\" Junestrand said. By now, the company has amassed over 400 clients across 40 markets, including big-league law firms like Cleary Gottlieb, Goodwin, Bird & Bird, and Mannheimer Swartling, Sweden's largest law firm. In October, Legora closed another blockbuster round, raising $150 million in Series C funding, led by Bessemer Venture Partners. Eudia emerged from stealth in February with $105 million in Series A funding from General Catalyst. The investment had just one major condition: Eudia would get $30 million up front and the other $75 million as it found other companies to buy. Its first acquisition was Irish-founded alternative legal services provider Johnson Hana. In October, Eudia also acquired the legal service provider Out-House. Jimoh Ovbiagele, Bench IQ's cofounder and chief executive, said Bench IQ has built a proprietary dataset and layered in large language models to forecast how judges tend to think and rule. Battery Ventures and Inovia Capital led the company's $5 million seed round. Before Bench IQ, Ovbiagele was a founder of Ross Intelligence, the legal research company that shut down after a costly lawsuit brought by Thomson Reuters. Priyanka Kulkarni spent nine years on a visa while working as an AI scientist for Microsoft. Now, her startup, Casium, which raised $5 million in seed funding, sells employers a portal to run visa cases end-to-end, replacing the Excel spreadsheets and, in many instances, the outside law firms that they usually rely on. The product is designed to respond to the rapidly changing employment immigration landscape as policy has swung in recent months. WeWork's former top lawyer raised $4 million to build an AI-native law firm. Covenant, cofounded by Jen Berrent, reviews fund docs for private market investors. Its tools use large language models to root through hundreds of pages of legal documents, raise red flags, and suggest stronger terms that are tailored to the investor's own playbook. Marveri wants to cut manual review from months to minutes. Their software sucks up all of a corporation's documents, then automatically renames, organizes, and analyzes them. The company emerged from stealth with $3.5 million in funding. High-profile litigator Alex Spiro \u2014 best known for helping Elon Musk defeat a defamation lawsuit and getting Alec Baldwin's manslaughter case dismissed \u2014 is advising the Marveri team. Theo Ai is building a \"predictive engine\" tool, aimed at law firms and large corporations, that it says takes the guesswork out of pricing a lawsuit. Earlier this month, the company told Business Insider it raised $3 million in new funding from Run Ventures, bringing total backing to more than $10 million. Trained on a firm's own data, when a new case lands, the model finds look-alikes in that history and returns a settlement likelihood and range. Jump to","label":0}

Andrew Yang has warned for several years that automation would upend the American workforce. In the run-up to his 2020 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, he predicted that self-driving cars alone could displace a million mostly male truck drivers with limited education \u2014 a shift that could \"destabilize society\" and even trigger \"riots in the street,\" he told The New York Times in 2018. Seven years later, Yang says the crisis he feared is no longer hypothetical. \"It's aging very, very well, unfortunately,\" he told CNN's Michael Smerconish of his predictions in a recent interview. Recent analyses indicate that AI and automation are already capable of performing a significant share of US labor tasks and are reshaping employment. MIT's Iceberg Index, released last week, found that current AI systems can already technically perform skills representing 11.7% of the US labor market \u2014 roughly $1.2 trillion in wages across finance, healthcare, and professional services. The New York Times, citing internal Amazon strategy documents and interviews, reported in October that the company believes automation could allow it to avoid hiring more than 600,000 US workers over the next few years, and that its robotics team has an ultimate goal of automating 75% of its operations. Salesforce, Walmart, HP, IBM, and Fiverr have all cited AI in recent rounds of layoffs or announced layoffs tied to AI. \"44% of American jobs are either repetitive manual or repetitive cognitive and thus could be subject to AI and automation,\" Yang said in the interview with CNN. \"We're seeing that unfold right now.\" Yang's 44% estimate is broadly in line with some major studies on automation. An IMF analysis from 2024 suggested that around 60% of jobs in advanced economies will be affected by AI, with half benefiting from the technology and the other being negatively impacted by it. A McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) report released last month found that technologies could theoretically automate more than half of US work hours. Yang pushed back against Roman Yampolskiy, a computer science professor at the University of Louisville and an AI safety researcher, who in September predicted 99% unemployment within five years. \"It's going to get bad. I certainly don't think 99% bad,\" Yang said. Using his 44% vulnerability benchmark, Yang offered a rough projection: if the US \"churns through\" even half of those jobs over the next decade, the country could see 30 to 40 million positions eliminated. \"That would be devastating,\" he said. \"That would be catastrophic for many, many communities.\" The rapid pace of AI-driven disruption has revived Yang's signature policy idea: a universal basic income that gives every American adult $1,000 a month, no strings attached. He said guaranteed cash would help workers survive the shockwaves of automation and maintain basic economic stability. To fund a nationwide program, Yang said the firms driving AI's explosive growth should bear the cost. He cited Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei, who floated to Axios in May the idea of a \"token tax\" that the government should levy on AI companies. With tech giants generating \"hundreds of billions\" in value \u2014 powered in part by data the public never knowingly provided \u2014 Yang said an AI tax or \"compute tax\" could raise \"very big numbers very quickly.\" Given that the US produced roughly $85,000 in GDP per person in 2024, according to the World Bank, Yang said his $12,000 annual Freedom Dividend \"seems pretty modest and reasonable.\" Yang said that a cash stipend isn't a cure-all \u2014 people also need purpose, structure, and a sense of community. But without financial stability, he said, millions risk being left behind and pushed toward radicalization. \"We could be doing much, much more for the millions of Americans who are going to be displaced,\" Yang said.

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"The consumption of avocados in the United States has risen significantly over the past few decades. According to the Wall Street Journal, Americans presently eat about 9 pounds of the creamy fruit per capita per year. That's far greater than the amount folks were consuming back in 2000 when the food's per-capita availability barely averaged 1 pound (via the USDA). The ever-rising demand may very well be linked to more widespread knowledge of avocado's various health benefits, but it also has something to do with increased access. About 90% of all the avocados currently smashed, spread, and chopped here in the U.S. come from Mexico, which wasn't actually allowed to export them to the States until 1997. Given that staggering statistic, avocado lovers who want to buy produce grown in America may wonder if that's even possible. Well, thanks to California, it (kinda) is. The Golden State is the largest domestic producer of avocados, churning out 90% of the home-grown harvest \u2014 the most of the merely three states that are able to produce to them: California, Florida, and Hawaii. However, California alone can hardly satisfy Americans' increasing demand. California, like Florida and Hawaii, boasts the right environmental conditions to grow the popular crop. Native to South-Central Mexico and Central America, avocados thrive best in warm areas with rich soil that get plenty of sunlight. There is one variety, however, that is actually native to California: the Hass avocado, which developed from a single tree in the 1920s and now makes up about 95% of California's total crop. Despite the rising demand and the state's growing potential, though, California's avocado production has seen a downturn over the past ten years. According to data from the California Avocado Commission, both the state's crop acreage and yield have been steadily declining since the late 2000s. The price to grow avocados in the United States has increased; paired with some resource restrictions, it makes farming the fruit less lucrative for domestic producers. As KPBS recently reported, the struggles of battling rising land and water costs, paired with a labor shortage, outweigh the benefits for some. \"A lot of my neighbors are...dropping the fruit because there ain't no local workers,\" one San Diego grower explained. \"Most of the big ranches around this area is gone because of the water prices is killing us, the labor is killing us.\" Still, California farms offer a welcome supplement to the import market. In 2024, the state's total harvest approached 365 million pounds (via California Avocado Growers). That's a lot of avocado toast for the locals.","label":0}
{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"The Indian government has ordered Apple and other smartphone manufacturers to pre-install a state-owned \u201csecurity\u201d app on all phones before they are sold to users. Adding fuel to the privacy fire, the government is also requiring smartphone makers to ensure that the app cannot be removed by users \u2026  Reuters reports that those who already own iPhones won\u2019t escape either: Apple and others are also being instructed by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to push the app to existing phones via a software update. The November 28 order, seen by Reuters, gives major smartphone companies 90 days to ensure that the government\u2019s Sanchar Saathi app is pre-installed on new mobile phones, with a provision that users cannot disable it. For devices already in the supply chain, manufacturers should push the app to phones via software updates, the ministry said in its order, which was not made public and was sent privately to select companies. The government is framing it as a way to help users recover lost and stolen phones, but it ensures that all phones can be tracked by the government, with obvious implications for user privacy. India Express reports that this move follows another DoT dictat that requires end-to-end encrypted messaging apps to link to the unique electronic serial number of the SIM. Right now, services like WhatsApp verify a user\u2019s identity by sending a one-time password (OTP) to their mobile number. But, to follow the DoT\u2019s directive, they will have to start accessing the IMSI of their SIM cards. IMSI stands for International Mobile Subscriber Identity, and is a unique number that identifies every mobile subscriber globally. It is stored on the SIM card. Since SIMs cannot be purchased without government ID, this would allow the government to determine the identity of any WhatsApp user. \"Withdrawing from that market in order to uphold its values is not a practical option.\"  Perhaps, but it's the best option. Companies need to stand up to authoritarian governments and protect our privacy. If all companies refuse to comply with India's demands and pull out then India would have to back off. Giving up our rights in the name of safety\/security never works. Apple is likely to push back, hoping to persuade the government to agree to a less extreme policy like offering the app to users during setup and allowing wording that encourages them to install it. However, ultimately, if negotiations are unsuccessful, it will have to comply with the law. Apple has already been forced to compromise user privacy in China by storing iCloud data on servers owned by a company directly linked to the Chinese government. Apple has also removed VPN and foreign news apps from its Chinese App Store when instructed to do so. As with China, Apple is in a double-bind here as India is not only a growing market for the company\u2019s products, but also an increasingly important manufacturing centre. Withdrawing from that market in order to uphold its values is not a practical option. Photo by\u00a0Chris Yang\u00a0on\u00a0Unsplash FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":"Apple has plenty of software and service launches coming in December, but new hardware products likely won\u2019t arrive until next year. Among the company\u2019s rumored 2026 products, there\u2019s one that\u2019s sure to earn a lot of attention: Apple Glasses. It\u2019s not often that Apple launches products in entirely new categories. Every year the company launches a bunch of new hardware, but typically we get updated iPhones, iPads, Macs, and products in other existing lines. The last \u201cbrand new\u201d product category we got was Apple Vision Pro. But rumors indicate another all-new debut could happen in 2026: Apple Glasses (or \u2018Apple Vision,\u2019 as it may be called). Though the product may not actually ship until 2027, Bloomberg reports that Apple Glasses could get unveiled this year as a sneak preview.  This advanced unveiling tends to happen with brand new product categories. For example, Vision Pro and Apple Watch both debuted more than half a year before shipping. The introduction of a brand new product category will itself merit a lot of buzz. But Apple Glasses could be especially attention-worthy for two additional reasons: Smart glasses are increasing in popularity, but they\u2019re still in their early days. Ray-Ban Meta are a current leader in the market, but they remain a niche, early adopter product. But Apple launching smart glasses could do a lot to make the category more mainstream. The company\u2019s track record in this area is strong. The iPod, iPad, and Apple Watch all arrived not as the \u201cfirst\u201d product in their respective categories. But they did help make those categories far more successful. Apple Glasses could do the same\u2014though it\u2019s no guarantee. The product could follow the path of Apple Vision Pro, which hasn\u2019t made as big an impact on the VR market as expected. I have a strong suspicion things will be different with Glasses. Having a much lower price point, comfortable form factor, and being marketed as an iPhone accessory will all help. Regardless of its actual success though, the existence of Apple Glasses will raise significant awareness around the smart glasses category. Another reason the product will merit a lot of attention is that it will be the first new AI-centric product Apple launches. Apple has been saying that new iPhones, iPads, and Macs are \u201cbuilt for Apple Intelligence\u201d for a couple years now. But Glasses will be heavily dependent on Siri and AI features unlike any other product\u2014and it\u2019s a hardware category that didn\u2019t exist pre-AI. The powerful AI upgrades coming to Siri soon will reportedly be a big part of the Apple Glasses experience. Apple Glasses have a lot going for them. As a brand new category of product, with potential to take smart glasses mainstream, and as Apple\u2019s first AI-centric debut, they merit a lot of attention. The question is: will that attention translate into becoming a hit? Are you interested in Apple Glasses? Why or why not? Let us know in the comments. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

{"date":"2025-12-01","content":" Arc Raiders  Extraction shooter Arc Raiders sells you the fantasy of being either a lone wanderer or part of a ragtag crew, rummaging through the wreckage of a fallen civilization to rebuild something better. Along the way, you can expect brutal gunfights with deadly machines and traitorous fellow raiders. It makes for a great adrenaline rush as you exchange fire with man and machine. Read More: Arc Raiders Is So Good I Keep Playing No Matter How Much I Suck But recently, I had the pleasure of chatting with a player who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s found a different role to play in Arc Raiders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 post-apocalyptic Italy: that of a fruit salesman. Reddit user GrumbleGrits recently shared a video of this experience, putting down firearms in exchange for fruit and other harmless goods. Check it out here: Welcome to the fruit shop \u00f0\u009f\u0099\u0082 byu\/GrumbleGrits inArcRaiders  This moment speaks to what I love about the extraction shooter genre and how it breaks open the expected routine of what we do in these kinds of games. The simple premise of getting in, grabbing loot, and getting out leaves a wide open space in between for unexpected emergent outcomes and creative playstyles, and that includes subversive ways of interacting with others. In a game where you can just as easily not shoot other players as you can otherwise murder them, why not consider peace? Why not find a new way to ascend the game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s meta? Read More: Arc Raiders Fans Have A New Tool For Revenge Against Assholes That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what GrumbleGrits and others have done. We recently chatted a bit over DM on Reddit about his experience as a post-apocalyptic fruit farmer setting up shop in an abandoned newsstand. Though he was quick to point out that there are others in Arc Raiders setting up trade shops (and many people coordinate on Reddit and elsewhere to arrange a trade for various hide-to-find pieces of loot) and insisted that he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to receive any special credit for his efforts, setting up a fruit stand in the game certainly requires work. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI always try to have different stock each time,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told me. \u00e2\u0080\u009cSometimes I bring as many harvestable plants as I can, typically focusing on the materials needed to train Scrappy.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll even trade non-edible goods as well, such as the many forms of loot that exist for no other reason than to sell to the in-game NPCs. But fruits and plants, which are needed to level up the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pet rooster that dispenses materials after every match, are important and, critically, often hard to come by. Arc Raiders\u00e2\u0080\u0099 typically unexpected and excessive violence can make holding on to these materials all the way to extraction hard enough as it is. That violence is something GrumbleGrits has to contend with when trading his goods. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not all sunshine and rainbows,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cgetting to the chosen location for my storefront, clearing out Arc, and surviving any aggressive raiders along the way can be really difficult and occasionally results in tragedy. Once I reach the spot and get situated, I usually don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much issue with being attacked by other raiders.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Read More: This Is The \u00e2\u0080\u0098Easiest\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Field Depot In Arc Raiders It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very different kind of fantasy than many are used to when it comes to Arc Raiders: venturing out not to just find what you can and keep it for yourself, but doing so with the intention to trade it with others, and putting in the work to establish a safe trading zone. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the only way GrumbleGrits plays, of course. \u00e2\u0080\u009cBetween working a real-world job and engaging with all the various other systems of Arc Raiders, and collecting items to trade away in the first place, it can be difficult to find time to goof off and set up these little shops,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. While trading fruit makes for a unique way to interact with others and use the game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loot system, GrumbleGrits isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t throwing down his weapons permanently any time soon. Just recently, he shared some footage of his first Queen kill. But who knows, maybe the loot he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll earn from this battle might show up on a store shelf soon. Of course, the experience is not without its theatrics. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI once had a couple of guys duel to the death with their melee weapons for a stack of mushrooms,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, recounting one of the more unique situations. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was a violent and quick battle,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009ca testament to how sought-after mushrooms can be. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re difficult to find if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know where to look.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Thankfully, GrumbleGrits and other players not only know where to look for hard-to-find loot, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also willing to share the wealth.
