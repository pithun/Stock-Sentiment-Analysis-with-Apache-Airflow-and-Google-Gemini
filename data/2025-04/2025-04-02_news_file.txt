1,2025-04-02,"Apple CEO Tim Cook today earned over $24 million selling Apple stock, according to a filing with the SEC. Cook sold 108,136 shares that he received on April 1 when restricted stock units vested.
The RSUs that vested yesterday were part of a time-based stock award that Cook was granted back in 2020. One-third of the shares vested in 2023, one-third in 2024, and the final third vested in 2025. The shares that were sold today were put in Cook's trust.
Restricted stock units are given to Cook regularly as bonus compensation, encouraging him to stay on as Apple's CEO. Cook has served as CEO since August 2011, and now that his RSUs have vested, Apple may give him another grant to keep him at the company for an even longer period. Cook also regularly receives RSUs that vest based on Apple's performance, with that award typically happening in October.
Apple executives that include Jeff Williams and Katherine Adams also received and sold stock worth $7,950,684 and $8,664,682, respectively.

2,2025-04-02,"Apple's efforts to diversify its supply chain may have been for naught with the Trump administration's new tariffs that target multiple countries where Apple sources components for its iPhones, iPads, and Macs.
Apple has worked to move some of its manufacturing to countries like India, Vietnam, and Thailand, all of which are facing steep tariffs in addition to China and Taiwan. There is a minimum 10 percent tariff for all U.S. trading partners, and ""reciprocal tariffs"" on several countries where Apple suppliers are located. Some of the tariffs:
As The New York Times notes, Apple is already contending with a 20 percent tariff in China, which is set to increase significantly. Taiwan, where Apple sources the Apple silicon chips that go into all of its devices, is facing a 32 percent tariff.
The last time Trump was in office, Apple was able to get tariff exemptions or avoid tariffs entirely for some products, but Trump claims that he will not provide exemptions this time around. Morgan Stanley estimates that devices imported from China will cost Apple an additional $8.5 billion annually without exemptions, though it is not clear if Apple would pass those costs to consumers with price increases.
Apple CEO Tim Cook has said in the past that the United States is not able to compete with China and other countries when it comes to manufacturing due to a lack of skilled workers with expertise in advanced tooling.
Apple stock is down 7.5 percent in after hours trading after the tariff announcements. The tariffs will go into effect on April 9, according to Trump.

3,2025-04-02,"Google is making paid features free at an absurd pace.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

It's no secret that OpenAI got the jump on, well, everyone when it released ChatGPT over two years ago. Now, as companies like Google and Apple try to compete, they're starting way behind OpenAI, at least in the eyes of the public. Just how big of a head start does OpenAI have? As of March 2025, ChatGPT has 700 million monthly active users, which is a staggering total.
That doesn't mean Google is powerless in the fight against OpenAI for the bulk of consumer-grade AI market share. In the years since ChatGPT was released, Google ramped up AI development first through Bard, later renamed Gemini. While OpenAI's plan to monetize ChatGPT involved making a bunch of early features free and locking advanced ones behind a paywall, Google is doing the opposite.
With Gemini, Google is almost exclusively developing new features for its paid Gemini Advanced tier, but that doesn't tell the whole story. Those features start out exclusive to the Google One AI Premium plan, which costs $20 per month, but they don't stay there for long. In the case of the company's latest Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental model, it only remained a Gemini Advanced perk for a mere four days before going free.
So, what does this tell us about Google's AI strategy, and is it even worth paying for Gemini Advanced anymore?

ChatGPT has a massive brand advantage over Gemini, to the point that some casual users refer to AI as a whole as just ""ChatGPT."" However, Google has had the technological edge over OpenAI's large language models (LLMs) for some time now. It's releasing new models at a steady bi-annual pace — sometimes quicker — and Google's latest Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental model is the highest-scoring in multiple AI benchmarks.
LMArena, a multifaceted AI benchmark, has Gemini 2.5 Pro ranking first on its leaderboard — ahead of Grok 3, GPT-4.5, and DeepSeek R1. Google called it the company's ""most intelligent AI model"" in its announcement of Gemini 2.5 Pro last week, and independent tests appear to back up those claims.

That leads us to why Google decided to make Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental free on March 29, just four days after it debuted on March 25. To truly take on ChatGPT, Google can't just convince new users to regularly use Gemini. It also has to try and entice current ChatGPT users to switch to Gemini, and the best way to do that isn't to limit the free tier to outdated models — it's to get the absolute best Gemini models in the hands of the most people.

Although some Gemini Advanced users may have been caught off guard by the short exclusivity period, Google confirmed this is exactly why it made Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental free in a social media post.
""The team is sprinting, TPUs are running hot, and we want to get our most intelligent model into more people’s hands asap,"" the company wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter) on the Gemini app account. ""Which is why we decided to roll out Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) to all Gemini users, beginning today.""
Gemini 2.5 Pro is taking off 🚀🚀🚀
The team is sprinting, TPUs are running hot, and we want to get our most intelligent model into more people’s hands asap.
Which is why we decided to roll out Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) to all Gemini users, beginning today.
Try it at no… https://t.co/eqCJwwVhXJMarch 29, 2025
Google's move regarding Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental might seem like a one-off, until you look at past examples of Gemini Advanced features going free. In recent months, numerous paid features have made their way to free users, including Gems — custom versions of Gemini catered to specific tasks. As of March 2025, free users can create their own custom Gemini bots or use pre-made Gems.
This example is quite important, since it directly challenges OpenAI's custom GPTs. Custom GPTs work similarly to Gemini Gems, as they are custom chatbots designed to suit a specific need. However, free ChatGPT users can only try out existing custom GPTs — they can't create their own. Meanwhile, we know that Google is offering similar functionality completely free with Gemini.
The list of paid Gemini Advanced features made available to free users includes document upload and analysis, image generation of people, Deep Research, and Saved info. Once again, it's worth noting that ChatGPT's version of Deep Research isn't free, potentially making the Gemini equivalent a more appealing option.

Google's strategy regarding Gemini is clear: the company wants to deliver more free features than its competitors, all while embedding AI into its existing services — like Google Search, Android, Workspace, and YouTube — to gain a competitive edge. But where does that leave Gemini Advanced subscribers?
Surprisingly, there are still plenty of reasons to subscribe to Google One AI Premium for Gemini Advanced access. For starters, Advanced users won't hit rate limits as early as free users. Even if the same models are available to free and paid accounts, Gemini Advanced users will get higher token counts for a larger context window.
With Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental, paying customers get a one-million-token context window that will expand to two million in the future.

That's in addition to all the other Gemini Advanced features that are still exclusive to the subscription, like NotebookLM — one of the most powerful AI note-taking and research tools available. The same goes for Gemini Live with screen sharing and live video streaming, which is rolling out to supported Android devices now.
Google's shocking move of making Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental free just days after its release underscores how important Gemini's unpaid tier is to the company's AI strategy. Somehow, it doesn't come at the expense of Gemini Advanced, either.

5,2025-04-02,"Most of us expect our ecommerce orders to show up at our doorsteps, but John Karlin had to drive eight hours from Oklahoma City to Freeport, Texas, to pick up his order: a Chinese electric car.
Karlin, a registered nurse and quality process analyst, read in the summer of 2021 that a tiny $5,000 EV—the Wuling Hongguang Mini EV—was outselling Tesla’s Model 3 in the Chinese market.
“I saw an article saying the most popular EV in the world is the Hongguang Mini EV, but you can't have one. So that got me asking: Well, why is it the most popular vehicle? And why can't I have one?” Karlin says. By October of the same year, he had studied all the requirements to bring this car to the US, placed an order from a Chinese auto exporter on Alibaba, and had the car, a more premium model called the Wuling Macaron, shipped across the oceans to him.
Still, Karlin was nervous when he got to the customs. He believes he was the first American to import this vehicle model to the US, and he had to navigate uncharted territories to make it happen. Thankfully, he breezed through the various processes of getting his car and then towed it all the way back to Oklahoma City, where he would register the vehicle, insure it, and drive it every day to work at the hospital.
The China-made Wuling Hongguang Macaron costs less than $8,000.
Karlin is definitely an outlier. Today, there are almost no Chinese electric cars sold in the US. In fact, the US has become an outlier in the world as affordable Chinese EVs have quickly taken over markets in Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa.
First, they are almost never sold here officially. Compared to Mexico, where 135,000 Chinese-branded vehicles were sold in 2023, accounting for 10 percent of total car sales, the US has no Chinese auto brands on sale (although it does sell a small number of made-in-China electric or hybrid cars by Polestar, Volvo and Ford). Many Chinese companies, like BYD and NIO, have explored the possibilities to enter the US market—this is one of the largest auto markets in the world, after all—yet plans have been deterred by economic calculations, political pressures, and rising tariffs such as the 25 percent tariffs announced in March on any cars imported to the US.
For many other countries, this is where parallel import, or unauthorized gray market vehicles, comes in. But they’ve been almost nonexistent in the US since 1988, when Congress passed a law essentially forbidding the import of any foreign cars unless they go through a lengthy and costly process to prove they meet US safety and emission standards. The law was passed when Japanese and European automakers were significantly squeezing the US auto market, which sounds familiar to Chinese EV brands’ market advantage today.
For example, the law requires vehicles to pass a crash test before the model can be admitted, and it has to be initiated by a registered importer approved by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), so it’s basically impossible for an individual looking to ship a single car to the US.
The major exception to this rule is that any vehicle that’s more than 25 years old is fair game and exempt from the approval process. “Some states, like California, have further restrictions, but for the most part, 25 years means nothing is needed,” says Derek Weldon, owner of Pacific Coast Auto, which facilitates imports for the mature US market for used Japanese cars for this exact reason. While these cars often face difficulties getting insured or repaired, they can usually be registered in the US with no obstacles.
Since China’s EV boom mostly took place in the last decade, none of these electric cars could have entered through this exception. “It would be impossible to import a new or used Chinese vehicle into the US unless it was built before the year 2000, a time before any Chinese EVs were made,” Weldon says.
Still, if you are ready to make compromises, there are some methods people can adopt to get a Chinese car legally into the United States, albeit temporarily or under significant restrictions.
What Karlin found out in 2021 was that some states, including Texas and Oklahoma, have separate safety regulations for low- and medium-speed vehicles that don’t go on highways. Traditionally, these vehicles are street-legal golf carts or farm vehicles, but he discovered that the tiny Wuling Macaron could be slotted into this category too.
Chinese auto brand BYD’s flagship sedan, the HAN EV, is made in Mexico.
“The Macaron has backup cameras; it has backup alarms that, as you get closer to items, it beeps faster and a little louder. So you know, it's so much more safe than just a regular low-speed or medium-speed vehicle,” Karlin says. He was able to register his Macaron provided that his car wouldn’t go above 35 miles per hour (hence no highway access), and he could satisfy that requirement by asking the exporter to hard-lock a speed cap for his vehicle. Since he was only using it to drive to work or grocery shopping in the urban center, Karlin says he didn't see such a limited top speed as a problem.
Another exception is that non-American citizens can bring their foreign vehicle to the country temporarily without getting an American license plate, says Cao Yang, owner of CDM Import, a Los Angeles–based company that’s exploring the nascent market for Chinese vehicle imports. Cao has helped facilitate some newer and larger Chinese cars to be shipped to the US temporarily.
For a car to be brought into the US through this route, it has to leave the country within 12 months and cannot change hands in the duration. In addition, China has its own rules for exporting cars for personal use. Normally, it only allows a vehicle to leave the country for six months, and requires the owner to pay a hefty deposit. Accounting for shipping times, it means that this specific vehicle would usually only be able to stay in the US for about three months—making it only suitable for test drives for car enthusiasts rather than everyday use. But during that short time window, “you can drive around with a Chinese license plate. They will print out a certificate of temporary importation, which you just need to stick to the windshield,” Cao says.
The same rule applies to Mexican citizens coming to the US. And since Chinese EVs have become ubiquitous in Mexico, and many people living on the border regularly commute between the two countries, Cao says it’s become easy enough to spot a Chinese EV in Los Angeles these days. Cao claims to see Chinese brands such as BYD, MG, and Roewe several times a month, and usually driven by non-Chinese owners.
The last way is going through a car manufacturer, which is allowed to bring in foreign vehicles for research, road tests, display, and other purposes. Chinese companies like BYD, Li Auto, and NIO have operations in the US and could legally bring in their own vehicles, says Cao.
Vehicles imported this way have to bear manufacturer plates and can’t be sold to individuals. However, since such vehicles are allowed on public roads, some companies could allow their employees, or even influencers, to take them for a ride. Cao says BYD has a number of its Chinese models at the company’s Pasadena design center. “Several times I’ve seen their employees driving the cars home. I even saw [one] parked where I live,” he says.
In a similar vein, Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, famously flew five Chinese EVs to Chicago last year and has been “driving them ever since,” according to his recent media interviews.
“As a normal course of business, all automakers globally buy competitive vehicles for benchmarking. When done, if the vehicle is purchased in the same country, it can be resold. Other vehicles, once benchmarking is completed, are disposed of,” Ford spokeperson Marty Gunsberg told WIRED. Have they been disposed of, we ask, or is he still driving them? “We have nothing to share on the status of these vehicles,” says Gunsberg.
With so many restrictions in place, getting a car from China to the US is going to cost a lot more than their original price in the home market.
Weldon says while his company doesn’t import cars from China, a comparable price to import a car from Japan to the US is usually between $105 to $130 per cubic meter, which means an average car could cost somewhere between $1,000 to $2,500 in shipping alone. Then there’s the price to hire a customs agent to process it, register it at the local DOT, and pay an insurer that’s willing to take the uncommon vehicle (which is often harder than expected) before it can finally go on the road legally.
Karlin ran the numbers for his Macaron and found that he spent about $13,000 in total, while the car itself was priced below $8,000.
Those numbers are sure to have increased now as tariffs against Chinese cars have been raised significantly. Last year, the Biden administration raised tariffs on Chinese EVs from 25 to 100 percent; then Donald Trump came into power and imposed 20 percent tariffs on Chinese products and, most recently, another 25 percent tariff on all imported cars.
BYD’s Dolphin Mini is also made in Mexico, so it can theoretically be imported to the US—if a buyer is prepared to jump through the right hoops.
But money may not be the biggest problem. The Biden administration also implemented a ban on importing Chinese “connected vehicles” in January. It’d be hard to find a Chinese EV these days that doesn't have the features associated with Bluetooth, cellular, or satellite connections, so it effectively bars the import of any newer Chinese cars.
Karlin says his Macaron has been followed by police cars, but never pulled over. After going to two different tag agencies to register his car, the state of Oklahoma requested to re-audit his paperwork, which they did and he passed just fine.
As for the car itself, which had gone through such lengths to be US legal, Karlin loved it. He enjoyed the EV’s innovative design, which is very different from the American cars he’s experienced, with nice little touches like putting a USB port behind the rearview mirror so a dashcam can easily be plugged in. And the Macaron’s minuscule size proved super helpful when trying to find spots in busy hospital parking lots, and U-turns on narrow roads were a breeze.
Karlin drove the Macaron for 12 months before a US company offered to buy the vehicle from him for research. The CEO of the buyer company came to meet him in Oklahoma City, and as they sat in the car together, “I could see he's smiling. I can see the wheels turning in his head as he's realizing this and that, and looking at these different features and materials,” he says.
Cao has been to a few car enthusiasts gatherings in the US where a Chinese media company has brought along the EVs they temporarily imported. He says the American participants really liked the Chinese cars and often wanted to know how to get one. “For those who are rich enough and have the connections, they probably are thinking about importing a few and experiencing it themselves.”

Automattic, the parent company of WordPress.com, is laying off about 16 percent of its workers. In a memo posted to the company’s website, CEO Matt Mullenweg says he’s making the change to “protect Automattic’s long-term future.”
Before the layoffs, Automattic’s website listed the company as having 1,777 employees. The company has since decreased its employee count to 1,495, meaning around 280 staff members were affected by the job cuts.
Last year, the third-party hosting company WP Engine filed a lawsuit against Automattic and Mullenweg after the company blocked WP Engine from WordPress.org’s server and took over its Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin. Mullenweg has stated that the legal battle could go on for years and “could potentially bankrupt me or force the closure of Wordpress.org.”
In October, Mullenweg offered his employees $30,000 or six months of salary to leave if they didn’t agree with his decision to ignite a public dispute with WP Engine. Automattic shed around 8.4 percent of its workforce after the first round of buyouts. 
“We have reached an important crossroads,” Mullenweg writes in his memo. “While our revenue continues to grow, Automattic operates in a highly competitive market, and technology is evolving at unprecedented levels. To support our customers and products, we must improve our productivity, profitability, and capacity to invest.”

Meghan Markle just dropped her first lifestyle collection — and it's already sold out.

        After months of anticipation, the Duchess of Sussex's lifestyle venture As Ever officially launched on Wednesday. The brand's entire collection sold out within an hour of it dropping online.
    

        As Ever's triumphant launch follows the successful debut of the duchess' Netflix series ""With Love, Meghan,"" which was a hit with viewers despite widespread criticism from the media and some fans who called the show boring and out of touch.
    

        Despite that, Meghan is proving her bet on her lifestyle career was worth taking.
    

        Both ""With Love, Meghan"" and As Ever were met with plenty of criticism. Outlets published dozens of negative articles about the series when it was released, lamenting its lack of relatability for the average viewer and criticizing Meghan's hosting tips as unnecessary.
    

        However, that criticism seemed detached from the show's successful reality. ""With Love, Meghan"" hit Netflix's top 10 list the week it premiered and amassed over 2.6 million views, according to The New York Times. Netflix also already announced that season two of the show will premiere in the fall of 2025.
    

        As Ever is on a similar path. When it was first announced, naysayers questioned Meghan's product line, saying items like flower petal sprinkles were gratuitous or assuming she would overcharge for her products. Others questioned whether Meghan had a clear vision for the brand since she changed its name from American Riviera Orchard to As Ever, despite the swap being largely due to a trademark issue.
    

        Lo and behold, it seems the Duchess of Sussex — and Netflix, her business partner in the brand — did have a clear vision for As Ever. As Ever blends the type of California luxury you might associate with Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop or Martha Stewart with royal elegance, creating a glossy feel that clearly appeals to buyers.
    

        Stacy Jones, the founder and CEO of Hollywood Branded, told Business Insider Meghan and Netflix are creating a brand that seemingly reflects the duchess herself.
    

        ""She's not an A-list actress. She's an A-list personality,"" Jones said.
    

        ""She's really pushed herself back into that influencer side of it versus that celebrity side of it where her brand requires content to be created around her, either by her or by someone else,"" she added. ""That's what Netflix is doing.""
    

        As Ever's first collection featured items that cost $12 to $15 — aside from a $28 limited-edition honey — and they sold out within an hour of its launch. The honey was gone in just five minutes.
    

        Thanks to standard shipping, it will be a few days before people get to try the products they ordered. And although it's unclear how much merchandise was available to begin with, the launch itself was a win for Meghan.
    

        Jones said the gap between the vocal criticism of Meghan's lifestyle ventures and their real-life success isn't surprising.
    

        ""People like to be able to complain and be really, really loud about that,"" she said. ""The haters are gonna hate, but she has a fan base.""
    

        Meghan has meticulously built up her base over the past decade. Many of them started out as fans of her blog, The Tig, which she ran from 2014 to 2017. They loved her recipes and hosting tips before she ever knew Prince Harry.
    

        ""She had a consumer base who are probably still fans of hers,"" Jones said. ""There's not been a big step away from where she was before, back in the days of actresshood and 'Suits,' but she's bringing in a new level of branding.""
    

        Jones also said that Meghan's fan base has proved fiercely loyal, sticking with her through her royal controversies. That makes them a huge asset for the duchess, which she seems aware of. As she shared on Instagram, Meghan reconnected with her ""OG Tig girls"" ahead of As Ever's launch.
    

        Meghan is finding a sweet spot in the lifestyle world because it blends her passions and the glamour of royal life. She's finding a way to share that with the world, and the proof is in the pudding (or rather, the jam).

Global deliveries of Tesla's flagship electric car models fell sharply in the first quarter — down 13% compared to last year — the company announced Wednesday. The drop comes as increasing competition erodes Tesla's market share and CEO Elon Musk's role as President Trump's cost-cutting tsar sparks a backlash among consumers.
The results, released before the opening bell on Wall Street, sent Tesla's already battered shares — which have lost 35% of their value since the start of the year — down even further in early trading. Before noon, however, the share price had rallied.
The sales report shows the biggest-ever quarterly decline in sales for Tesla, which delivered 336,681 vehicles in the first three months of the year compared to 386,810 from the same period in 2024. Analysts had expected a dip, but not one so steep, with an average estimate of 372,410 deliveries.
""I might call it a disaster,"" says Daniel Ives, managing director at Wedbush Securities. Wall Street was ""anticipating softness, but this was, I think, one of the worst delivery quarters relative to the original expectations in the last few years,"" he says.
Ives, who has been bullish on Tesla in the past, says part of the blame rests with Tesla's failure to refresh its vehicle lineup, but most of the trouble comes from ""Musk self-inflicted brand issues.""
The controversial Tesla CEO ""needs to change course because if we continue down this path, [there are] dark days ahead for Tesla,"" Ives says.
It's a sentiment echoed by other analysts. Gene Munster, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, posted on X in February that ""the catalyst"" for lowered expectations for Tesla ""has been Musk's increased political visibility, alienating buyers.""
Musk, who backed Trump in the 2024 election and donated more than a quarter of a billion dollars to his campaign, has become a key figure in the new administration's push to reduce government spending. As the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, Musk is the public face of often unpopular cuts, which include the elimination of entire agencies. His moves have sparked widespread anger, triggering massive protests at Tesla stores and acts of vandalism targeting the company's vehicles, chargers and storefronts.
Most recently, Musk poured some $20 million into a Wisconsin Supreme Court race in an unsuccessful effort to tip the court in Republicans' favor. Speaking at a rally in the state ahead of Tuesday's poll, Musk acknowledged that working for the White House was ""a very expensive job"" and that ""my Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone roughly in half."" (Liberal judge Susan Crawford won the race, which will keep the court leaning in Democrats' direction.)
The slumping sales come despite the Trump administration's efforts to help sell Teslas. Last month, Trump even showed off several Tesla models at the White House and vowed to buy one for himself in an apparent bid to boost sales. That was followed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik saying in an interview with Fox News that people should ""buy Tesla"" shares.
Sales have also been falling substantially across Europe in recent months.
Some experts say the only way Tesla can recover its brand image is to ditch Musk as CEO. But Ives doesn't think that's the answer. 
""I continue to believe he's really the CEO of Tesla and … likely [will be] for another 5 to 10 years,"" Ives says. ""[But] he's going to have to take a step back from DOGE and start to actually become more involved [at Tesla].""

10,2025-04-02,"Tesla just announced its results for the first three months of 2025, and they represent the steepest sales decline in company history. Deliveries fell by 50,000 vehicles, to 336,681 cars, down 13% from the same period last year. It was Tesla’s worst quarter since 2022.
Most analysts were expecting a large sales decline, in part because numbers coming out of Europe have not been good, and because Tesla temporarily closed some factories to update production lines for the new Model Y. There exists a wishful belief that some buyers held off while they waited for the new version of its most popular car to become available.
On social media, users report that the updated Model Y vehicles quickly became available at the start of March. And on Tuesday, Electrek reported that Tesla currently has $200 million worth of Cybertrucks sitting unsold in its inventory. The “other vehicles” category, which includes Model S, X, and Cybertruck (and perhaps the long forgotten Semi), was down 12,000 vehicles over the period last year. Which is to say, Tesla’s truly newest vehicle since the Model Y appears dead on arrival.
It is hard not to overlook the broader problems facing Tesla, namely the intense politicization of the brand under Elon Musk and fierce competition from rivals.
Polls in recent months have shown that the majority of Americans do not seem to like Musk’s polarizing brand of politics. But worldwide protests, including vandalism, could have told you that. The traditional buyers of electric cars, eco-conscious liberals, are turned off by his right-wing views and alignment with President Trump. And while conservatives may appreciate his major backing of the Republican party, his cartoonish antics can be grating. MAGA supporters can espouse their views by purchasing a large pickup truck that will not get them bullied or ostracized by half the country. They do not need to buy an electric car to signal their values.
On Tuesday, Musk suffered a political setback in Wisconsin after his choice in a Supreme Court election there lost to liberal judge Susan Crawford. Musk spent $26 million on the race with support from President Trump in hopes of flipping the liberal majority. Even though Wisconsin chose Trump in the presidential election, sentiment suggests voters there do not like Musk’s slashing of the federal government or attempts to buy local elections.
On the competition front, China’s BYD is outselling Tesla once again, with sales of 416,000 electric vehicles in the first quarter. The company has managed to run circles around Tesla in its second-largest market, offering affordable cars with impressive performance including high-speed charging and free self-driving functionalityâall while opening factories around the world. Meanwhile, Tesla’s line of vehicles is staleâin a market like China that is not great, as buyers demand newness. Sales of China-made Tesla’s fell 11% in the quarter.
But no matter, Tesla is a robotics and artificial intelligence company now. That is why its market valuation of $800 billion far exceeds other automakers that sell many more vehicles like Toyota and Ford. Tesla claims it is going to create robots that can replace humans on factory lines, and all the cars on the road today are going to be replaced by autonomous Cybercabs.
Even there, a robot marathon in Beijing suggests Tesla’s Optimus robot prototype is behind Chinese competitors that appear much more agile.
The key question, if you believe Musk’s next act for Tesla is not in vehicles but futuristic robotics, is how does it get there if its prime moneymaker, selling cars, dries up? Tesla was a front-runner in the electric vehicle space, but its moat has all but evaporated while its CEO is distracted by politics and tarnishing the brand. Musk is more closely involved in politics than any CEO in recent memory, and it is clear there is a reason why other company leaders shy away from it.
Tesla has more than $30 billion in cash to help it fund investments, and sales could rebound in the coming quarters if consumers become fatigued by protests. Earlier backlash against companies like Bud Light and Target typically did not last very long. Ultimately, what most car buyers care about is value. Tariffs imposed by President Trump could benefit Tesla too, as the company manufacturers its cars for the U.S. market domestically.
But waiting could only metastasize the problem if it does not improve, and from a fundamental business perspective it is clearer than ever that Tesla is not the special company it once was. It is sad in a senseâit did not have to be this way. Tesla’s wounds are wholly self-inflicted.
Not all may be lost, thoughâthere have been rumors circulating on Wednesday that Musk may leave his role with DOGE soon. Maybe the backlash is getting to him.

11,2025-04-02,"Amazon appears to be taking measures to combat GPU scalping by reserving some stock of Nvidia’s RTX 5000 and AMD’s Radeon 9000 series graphics cards for its Prime subscribers. According to a report by Club386, select high-end GPUs are now available exclusively to Prime members, potentially limiting the impact of scalpers and resellers. Notably, Amazon has not explicitly announced this as an anti-scalping tactic, leaving room for speculation about its true intentions.
Several Nvidia RTX 5000 series GPUs, from the RTX 5080 to the RTX 5070, are listed as “reserved for Prime members” on Amazon, preventing non-members from purchasing them. The flagship RTX 5090 is notably exempt, likely due to its high price, while the RTX 40 series remains unaffected, possibly because of limited remaining stock. 
Similarly, a certain number of AMD Radeon 9000 series GPUs, including models like the XFX Quicksilver Radeon RX 9070 OC and Sapphire Pulse Radeon RX 9070 XT, are also restricted to Prime members on Amazon. However, these GPUs are currently listed at inflated prices.
The strategy, whether intentional or not, could serve as a deterrent to those looking to buy up stock in bulk for resale at inflated prices. Scalping has been a persistent issue in the GPU market, where limited supply and high demand has led to extreme markups on secondary markets. By requiring a Prime membership, Amazon effectively adds a paywall that might discourage opportunistic resellers while still ensuring that genuine customers have a better chance at securing a card.
While this move could benefit gamers and PC enthusiasts frustrated by past shortages, it also raises questions about accessibility. Some consumers argue that locking purchases behind a paid membership places an additional burden on those who may already be struggling with the high costs of new GPUs.
Neither Nvidia nor AMD have commented on Amazon’s apparent strategy, leaving it unclear whether this is a coordinated effort or an independent decision by the retailer. Additionally, there is no word on whether this policy will extend beyond initial launch windows or if it will apply to future hardware releases.
For now, those looking to secure one of these next-gen GPUs may want to consider a Prime subscription as a potential advantage in the purchasing process.
AMD finally shared technical specifications and pricing for its latest RDNA 4-based Radeon RX 9070 series GPUs. After a rather dull announcement at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the company today hosted a special online event where it spoke about architectural details and new features that we can expect from the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT graphics cards.
Alongside the launch of the Radeon RX 9000 series, AMD also announced key updates to its upscaling and performance-boosting technologies. FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 4 represents a significant shift in AMD’s approach to image upscaling and frame generation, while HYPR-RX receives refinements to further optimize gaming performance.
After a long wait, the future of AMD's best graphics cards is finally here. The company just announced the RX 9000 series, comprised of two new GPUs: The RX 9070 XT and the RX 9070. Both are set to launch on March 6 at $599 and $549, respectively. If AMD lives up to the expectations performance-wise, these GPUs might be an absolute mainstream hit.
AMD's focus throughout the presentation was the fact that gamers buy mainstream GPUs more often than behemoths along the lines of the RTX 5090. To that end, AMD cited its own research, saying that 85% of gamers buy GPUs that cost less than $700. At the same time, higher resolutions are slowly becoming mainstream, with more and more people buying 1440p and 4K monitors. The needs of gamers have gone up, now including solid performance in ray tracing, but keeping it affordable is important too.
As a huge GPU enthusiast, a new launch is basically a party for me -- and it's a party that often lasts for months. With both Nvidia and AMD staggering their product releases, there's plenty to get excited for as new models keep getting added to our ranking of the best graphics cards every few weeks.
This time, the excitement is only true on paper. In fact, I'm beginning to feel disappointed. After waiting for Blackwell for a long time, it's starting to feel like it would've been better if we waited a little bit longer.
The GPU shortage is back

After Tesla's rough start to the year, Elon Musk is probably lucky that Americans can't buy BYD cars.

Tesla's Chinese rival had another spectacular quarter, with sales jumping 60% in the first three months of 2025.
    

        BYD has sold about 416,000 EVs and 570,000 hybrids this year. Tesla vehicle deliveries, meanwhile, came in well below analyst expectations, with the automaker announcing first-quarter deliveries of 336,700 EVs on Wednesday.
    

        It's the second successive quarter that BYD has outsold its rival, with Tesla battling plunging sales as protests against Musk and DOGE spread worldwide.
    

        Most concerningly for Musk, a growing proportion of BYD's sales are coming from outside China.
    

        In March, the Warren Buffett-backed automaker reported record overseas sales for the third time this year as it expands aggressively in international markets.
    

        By contrast, Tesla's sales in Europe, its third-biggest market behind the US and China, collapsed by 42% in the first two months of the year.
    

        High tariffs mean BYD does not sell its cars in the US, but it's squeezing Tesla in China by undercutting it on price and overtaking it on innovation.
    

        BYD on Tuesday opened presales of its Tai 3 SUV, which has a range of just over 300 miles and starts at 139,800 yuan, or about $19,270. There's also a version that includes BYD's on-board drone system priced at 203,800 yuan, or about $28,000.
    

        BYD has also unveiled new self-driving technology and ultrafast charging tech this year, and last month announced annual revenues that outstripped Tesla's.
    

        Meanwhile, Tesla's stock price has collapsed since hitting a high in December, with more investors expressing angst over Musk's involvement with DOGE.
    

        Shares dipped again on Wednesday after Tesla announced its first-quarter deliveries before rebounding in afternoon trading.

Apple's stock is on the way down after the tariff announcement
The remainder of Apple CEO Tim Cook's Restricted Stock Units couldn't have vested at a better time, with 108,136 shares sold just before tariffs were announced. It's not hard to figure out when Apple CEO Tim Cook is about to make a bunch of money, as his Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) sales take place at the same time every year. He made $16 million selling stocks in April 2024 and $50 million later that October.Wednesday's sale was shared via an SEC filing, which shows 108,136 shares were sold. That netted Cook $24 million just as President Donald Trump stepped out on stage to announce tariffs.Of course, it wasn't planned this way. The early 2024 sale took place on April 5, a Friday, and could have just as easily taken place later in the week.According to MacRumors, the RSUs sale was the last of three that was from a time-based stock award granted in 2020. Apple awarded the RSUs to Cook as a part of his compensation and as an encouragement to remain as CEO.Lucky chanceThe announced tariffs have already had a profound effect on the market futures. Apple has plummeted more than 5% in the time since the announcement, which is about $170 billion. Cook, looking at the stock price after hours. Image source: AppleUnless something changes before the stocks close Thursday, it could be a bad time for Apple and the rest of the US stock market. Beyond the market's initial reactions, the biggest concern will be over how they affect prices of goods like Apple's iPhone.A 10% flat rate tariff is being applied to every imported good, then additional tariffs are being imposed on select countries. A 34% tariff on goods from China, a 46% tariff on goods from Vietnam, and a 32% tariff on goods from Taiwan will have significant impacts on Apple's products.It isn't clear how any company will handle the tariffs, but the most likely result is passing the cost to consumers. Economists were predicting up to $6 trillion in costs to Americans, but that's when the expected tariffs were much lower.Nothing has been said yet of possible exemptions from Trump's tariffs. Apple, Google, Meta, and others have attempted to curry some favor from the President and his administration, which may yield some result.However, Trump is unpredictable and could ask these American companies to bear the weight of this ""transition."" Ultimately, Trump hopes these tariffs will force companies to source parts, materials, and labor from the United States.Regardless, Cook's twice-annual RSUs sale managed to hit at the exact right hour to give him a few more million in the bank. Cook is a known philanthropist that invests his funds and donates to charity, and the $24 million he earned today went to his trust.

Buying a home is a high-stakes game, often with hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line. Making a wrong decision can lead to foreclosure and bankruptcy; making the right decision can generate wealth that is passed down for generations.

        When people are ready to settle down, they're confronted with all the usual dilemmas: whether to buy a home; where to buy a home; what kind of home to buy; and how much to spend. These highly emotional decisions are all more manageable using the lessons of behavioral economics, which I studied as an economist.
    

        When I took a new tech job offer in 2017, it meant leaving San Diego for Seattle. As I set out to find a new home for myself, my husband, and my mom in my new city, I wanted to avoid getting caught up in the competitive pressure of beating out other buyers and making rash decisions that I might later regret. So I decided to divide my search into two phases. In the first, I would take my time getting to know the city and its various neighborhoods by renting a home. In the second, once I had a clear sense of my preferences, I would begin making offers on properties that met my criteria. By taking this approach, I hoped to avoid the pitfalls of hasty decision-making and make an intelligent, informed choice.
    

        For about five months, I spent a great deal of time exploring the different neighborhoods and assessing their pros and cons. From historic homes dating back to the 19th century to midcentury modern homes from Seattle's post-World War II boom to modern new construction, there were plenty of options.
    

        The most significant tradeoff to be made when choosing is location versus home size. I initially thought of a short commute and a large home as must-haves, but given my budget and the need to have space for three adults and three dogs, I had to sacrifice on the length of my commute. Many homebuyers make this same compromise. According to a Redfin survey, 89% of homebuyers would rather purchase a single-family home with a backyard than a unit in a triplex with a shorter commute.
    

        Soon we focused our efforts on West Seattle, a neighborhood located on a peninsula across the sound from downtown. My commute to the office would take about 30 minutes each way by bus, where I could at least get some work done with the complimentary WiFi. This was a decent tradeoff, given that homes in West Seattle were about $100,000 less than homes closer to the downtown office.
    

        Now in phase two, when I began viewing properties and making offers, I became hyperconscious of how my emotions might influence my decision-making. Common mistakes made by homebuyers include becoming too attached to a particular home, fixating on the list price instead of the market value, following the herd, and letting fatigue cloud judgment.
    

        You must try to avoid falling in love too quickly with a home. Once you start picturing your future in a home, it can become challenging to walk away, and it can suck you into a fierce bidding war. Block out any and all thoughts about hosting holidays or your children playing in the backyard. Yes, it is a good idea to consider whether the home will suit you in the future, but if you become too attached to that future, you're working against yourself. People value a home more if they already feel like they own it.
    

        Behavioral economists have a term for this: the endowment effect. The behavioral economist Jack Knetsch has found that people's willingness to sell an item they own was lower than their willingness to buy an item they did not own, even when the subjects knew ownership was assigned randomly. In one experiment, test subjects were given either a lottery ticket or cash. Most people opted to keep whatever form of compensation they had received first instead of trading it for the other option. For a variety of reasons, whether an aversion to feeling loss or a bias toward the status quo, people tend to get attached to the bird in their hand, even when there might be two in the bush.
    

        List prices can also be misleading. In a hot market, sellers may advertise their homes for significantly less than what buyers are ready to pay in order to spark a bidding war. This amounts to a bait-and-switch.
    

        As a buyer, don't take the bait. Don't anchor your expectations on the listed price. The anchoring effect refers to a person's tendency to focus on the first piece of information they hear while making decisions. In a famous lab experiment by the late Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, research subjects spun a wheel of fortune with numbers from 0 to 100. The participants were then asked to guess the share of African countries that were members of the UN. Participants whose spin landed on a lower number were more likely to guess a low number. Participants whose wheel spin landed on a high number were more likely to guess a high number. The number the needle of the wheel landed on was completely irrelevant, yet the research subjects still used it as an anchor for their guesses.
    

        The list price of a home may contain some helpful information about what the seller believes its value is. But ultimately the value of the house is set by the market.
    

        If you need to, take a break. Losing bidding war after bidding war — which happens a lot — fosters fatigue and impatience, which can lead you to give up too soon or to buy a home you later regret.
    

        Behavioral economists have repeatedly found that the quality of decisions deteriorates when an individual is overburdened with too many options. A study published in Health Economics found that orthopedic surgeons made worse recommendations toward the end of their shifts. Doctors were less likely to recommend surgery for patients who would have benefited just as much from surgery as patients seen earlier in the surgeon's shift.
    

        Also, avoid following the herd. If others are ready to bid high, you could be tempted to do the same and stretch your budget. Herding behavior, another behavioral economics term, can lead to bubbles in the housing market or the stock market and was one of the culprits for the subprime mortgage crisis of 2008. The best way to avoid getting caught up in speculation bubbles is to not speculate in the first place and make offers appropriate only to your personal financial circumstances.
    

        After spending a few weeks touring homes in the area, I came across a property that immediately caught my eye. It had everything my family was looking for. But there was one giant red flag: the home had been on the market for nearly a year without any offers.
    

        Upon further inspection, I noticed that the house was located across the street from a strip mall and had a strange layout. Even though I liked the home, I wanted to avoid paying more than other buyers might think it was worth. So I kept looking.
    

        When buying a home, you have no choice but to concern yourself with resale value. Life is unpredictable; there is always the chance you might not stay in the home long term, and you don't want to pay more than what you can resell it for.
    

        There is tension in this advice: a homebuyer must avoid herding behavior by thinking for themself while simultaneously considering how other people might value homes in the future.
    

        The way to walk the middle path is detached observation — recognize the behavior patterns of others without letting it unduly bias your decision-making.
    

        About a month later, we found a home that seemed too good to be true. Ample space, close to public transit, even a view of Puget Sound and the Olympic Mountains. However, the home was 70 years old, so we would need to update the electrical, plumbing, and heating. Since we were renting elsewhere, we could delay moving to get this work done.
    

        Things go wrong after you buy a home. Thinking that these problems won't end up costing you significant time and money is what behavioral economists call optimism bias: the tendency to overestimate the likelihood of favorable outcomes and underestimate the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes. The challenge, then, is to consider the risks and whether they are worth the reward.
    

        As I prepared to make an offer to buy a home, I thought back to the hundreds of homeowners going through foreclosure that I interviewed while interning at the Boston Fed. They experienced bad luck on top of bad luck — deaths, divorces, medical emergencies, job loss, and a global recession. Any of those things could happen to me.
    

        With all the repairs the house needed, I determined the maximum amount I could afford to pay was $950,000. I liked this particular home more than any other home on the market priced below $950,000, so I reasoned that this amount must be my value for the home. But I still had a nagging feeling that I was overextending myself and overpaying.
    

        What if the roof sprang a leak? And what if, because I had already spent my savings repairing the plumbing, electrical, heating, and cooling, I didn't have any money left to repair the roof?
    

        I could have kept going down the list of unlikely catastrophes. Instead, I focused on the unlikeliness of the scenario rather than the pain of the scenario. This helped me get out of my head and back to the task at hand. In economics, expected utility theory hypothesizes that individuals weigh uncertain outcomes according to their likelihood and the net benefit of each outcome. I shuddered at the thought of a bad scenario, like being laid off during a severe recession and housing-market downturn. However, according to expected utility theory, I should weigh that feeling against the likelihood of that scenario, which I reasoned to be a once-in-a-century event. In all likelihood, my job was safe, the economy was fine, and the value of homes would keep going up.
    

        The home was listed at $840,000. I submitted my bid on the home for that amount. When you're deciding whether to bid above or below the asking price, look up how competitive the housing market is in the neighborhood and how the home compares to what else is on the market. If the market is cool, it's advisable to come in low. However, if the market is hot, the seller may completely ignore your offer if it's below the asking price.
    

        Even though I offered $840,000, I was ready to go as high as $940,000. Later that day, my agent called me to deliver the good news: we won the home at list price. No one else even submitted a bid.

17,2025-04-02,"In a recent NYSE (ICE) TV interview, Stash Graham, managing director and chief investment officer of Graham Capital Wealth Management, warned that tariffs could set off a negative feedback loop in the stock market. As consumer spending contracts and manufacturing orders decline, falling profits could lead to lower share prices and a diminished wealth effect.
Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
KRISTEN SCHOLER (KS): My next guest is Stash Graham. He is managing director and chief investment officer of Graham Capital Wealth Management. Stash, thank you so much for joining the show this morning. With fractional losses for the S&P 500 and the Dow. How is the market interpreting the president’s latest tariff talk?
STASH GRAHAM (SG): Good morning, Kristen, and happy Liberation Day to all those who either celebrate or, I guess, cry. I think you’ve primarily already seen the movement. You’ve seen earnings revisions come down week after week for the last two, three months. So, Kristen, I think there’s some degree of pricing in this. I think the interesting part over the next few days will be: Do we have a buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news dynamic? But right now, again, you have businesses across the country trying to figure out if they already haven’t tried to front-run tariffs, and we’ve seen that show up in the manufacturing data, some of these other industries that maybe are indirectly affected by tariffs. What’s going to be their game plan in the coming quarters, how will they deflect higher costs, and ultimately how will they continue to maintain market share without really increasing prices too much, which ultimately loses that market share for the consumer?
KS: Should the consumer be prepared for inflation? Should they get a head start? We’ve seen the soft data indicate that they are, in fact, anticipating an increase in the pace of price gains.
SG: Kristen, this is going to be one of the major variables that people should watch over the next month or two: How will the hard data and the soft data meld? As you mentioned, soft data has been consistently bearish and pessimistic. The last one to two months, say, come into December, but the hard data really hasn’t reflected in that soft data. Now, there have been moments. We just saw consumer spending or the Atlanta Fed came out with their GDP forecast, which updated yesterday. It showed that consumer spending PCE came down by 0.6%. It’s not too often you see contractions in consumer spending over a quarter without it being associated with some type of recession. So we’re not in a recession, not yet, but we have to watch what these impacts are because we are a consumption-based society.
KS: What does this mean for stock performance? I think many strategists on this show anticipated that we would see very strong economic growth this year, that the tariff talk was just a negotiating tactic, that President Donald Trump’s visit here at the New York Stock Exchange was a bullish sign for stocks. But of course, we’ve seen that environment change over the course of the past six weeks.
SG: Absolutely. Kristen, again, as I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, we have seen earnings revisions and expectations get revised lower over the calendar year of 2025. But, right now, the consensus is still expecting 10-11% of earnings per share growth through the S&P 500. We believe that’s too high right now. This is a common question we get: What are the impacts of tariffs? Will we see it immediately to your prior question? No, not necessarily. But again, in certain parts of our economy, we’ve already witnessed it. We saw a front-running or a pull-forward of manufacturing orders. Now, on the other side of it, we just saw an update where one of the recent regional Fed reports showed that manufacturing new orders really has collapsed over the last 30 days. So we’ve already seen a bullwhip effect within manufacturing. But I think the larger issue, and again, going back to a prior question you had in regard to consumption, is if consumers consume less, their real disposable income continues to fall behind inflation, their real disposable income falls, their consumption should shrink if they’re not borrowing on credit. What does that do to business revenue if they can’t sell the same amount of goods that they were expecting? Lower profits and lower profitability means lower share prices, and that means a lower wealth effect. And it all has, unfortunately, a loop and a feed on itself. So we haven’t seen it yet. The loop hasn’t started, but it is something we should be watching over the next quarter or two.

18,2025-04-02,"The filing opens door for the president to sell over $2 billion in stock.
Shares in Donald Trump's social media company sank in morning trading on Wednesday, a day after the company filed paperwork with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could allow the president's trust to sell more than $2 billion of shares.
Trump Media and Technology Group filed a registration with the SEC on Tuesday that would open the door for the president's trust to sell up to nearly 115 million shares, which are worth more than $2.3 billion.
The filing does not guarantee the sale of the shares nor provide any information about a future sale. Since Trump took office, he transferred his stake of the company into the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, which is controlled by his son, Donald Trump Jr.
A sell-off from Trump, the company's largest individual shareholder, could panic investors and damage the company's stock price.
As of midday Wednesday, the company's stock price was down about 5%.
Trump Media and Technology Group pushed back on the possibility that Trump may attempt to sell any shares in a statement on Wednesday.
""Legacy media outlets are spreading a fake story suggesting that a TMTG filing today is paving the way for the Trump trust to sell its shares in TMTG. To be clear, these shares were already registered last June on an S-1 form, and today TMTG submitted a routine filing that re-registers them on an S-3 form in order to keep the Company's filings effective. In fact, there currently is no open window for any affiliate to sell shares,"" the statement said.
The president also has previously said he plans to hold his stake in the company.
""I don't want to sell my shares. I don't need money,"" Trump told reporters in September.
The SEC filing effectively puts investors on notice about millions of shares that could be sold on the open market, finance experts told ABC News.
The filing provides updated information about Trump's majority stake in the company and flags the possibility of an additional 8 million shares hitting the open market, according to University of Florida finance professor Jay Ritter, who described the filing as a requirement if the company insiders attempted to sell off their shares.
""In this offering it says the Trump trust could sell shares -- it doesn't necessarily mean that they will,"" Seth Goldstein, an analyst at research firm Morningstar, told ABC News. ""It signals to the market that they could.""
""This leaves it up in the air if and when a share sale will happen,"" Goldstein added.
Some insiders have been able to sell shares at a profit, taking advantage of the company's high stock price.
""Trump Media has been pretty unsuccessful at creating an operating business model, but they have been quite successful at selling their stock,"" Ritter said.
According to Ritter, a sell-off by company insiders like Trump could ""really tank the share price"" by signaling declining confidence in the company's business model.
""The sale of the Resale Securities being offered pursuant to this prospectus, or the perception that these sales could occur, could result in a significant decline in the public trading price of our Common Stock,"" the filing said.

19,2025-04-02,"With the deadline for TikTok to sell or face a ban (again) looming, a new potential buyer has emerged. Amazon has thrown its hat in the ring to take over the popular and addictive video platform, according to a report from the New York Times, offering up a last-minute bid that is likely tied to the retail giant’s desire to milk the lucrative TikTok Shop for every penny it can.
Amazon reportedly delivered its bid to Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, two people with the distinction of seeming like incredibly bad hangs among the stiff competition presented by the nightmare blunt rotation that is the Trump cabinet.Â Apparently, per the Times, no one in the White House considers Amazon’s bid to be a serious one, so don’t expect TikTok to be a Bezos brand any time soon.
So Amazon’s pitch for its TikTok takeover now sits on the pile of bids that have emerged for the platform, none of which seem to have a whole lot of momentum despite the fact that TikTok is set to once again be banned on Saturday, April 5, if no deal is in place. That will mark 75 days from the point that Trump offered an extension on the deadline for Chinese parent company ByteDance to divest itself of TikTok and hand it over to an American companyâthough word is that Trump is considering offering another extension.
Trump and his team are scheduled to meet on Wednesday to assess the landscape of offers, but the terrain has changed considerably from how it was in January. Back then, Trump had just taken office and was riding on pretty solid approval ratings (well, solid for him, at least). Extending TikTok’s window (and getting the app to give him a very public “thank you”) gave him a boost with young people. There was at least a semblance of goodwill, and Big Tech was in full suck-up mode, willing to go to significant lengths to curry favor with the President.
Now, as the stock market “corrects” and Trump’s extremely unpopular tariffs go into effect, his administration is looking for a win. Saving TikTok now seems imperative for Trump to hold onto whatever positive sentiment he can find, lest he face an embarrassing loss. The President has floated the idea of offering tariff relief to China in exchange for finalizing a TikTok sale, but he doesn’t seem to have much support even in his own party for that, per Politico. Meanwhile, China has barely budged on its position that it has no interest in divesting and is even willing to just accept the ban instead of selling.
With leverage slipping away, Trump is reportedly even considering allowing ByteDance to retain ownership over the TikTok algorithm, according to the Washington Postâa move that would keep arguably the most valuable part of the company in the hands of the Chinese firm. In that scenario, an American company would operate the TikTok platform while leasing the algorithm from ByteDance.
Frankly, at this point, it seems like just about everything is on the table for Trump as he scrambles to find a way to maintain his position as TikTok savior. So with the clock ticking (and tocking) as the Saturday deadline rapidly approaches, here is a look at who is still in the game to potentially take over TikTok, should Trump and company actually get a deal done before the deadline.
Arguably the name that has been most commonly tied with a TikTok takeover, enterprise software firm Oracle would probably be the betting favorite to buy the platform. It’s been tied to TikTok since 2020 when it agreed to enter into a partnership with ByteDance to handle the data of US-based users. Politico reported that the company was “accelerating talks” to finalize a deal last month, but Oracle’s arrangement would leave the algorithm in the hands of the Chinese firm, which remains a non-starter for some in Trump’s circle.
Kevin O’Learyâbest known as Mr. Wonderful on Shark Tank and the most obnoxious guest on any given CNBC showâand Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have perhaps the most publicized plan to take over TikTok. The duo has put together a group of financial backers who have committed as much as $20 billion to the effort. They’ve also taken to calling themselves the “People’s Bid for TikTok” which, sure. Their plan is apparently to rebuild TikTok in a way that would collect less user data, and they are not interested in the existing algorithm. The group is also apparently very open to other owners joining its bid.
A considerable dark horse in the TikTok bidding process is Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast. The YouTuber, who may have successfully developed the most vapid personality in all of human history, apparently considered joining the People’s Bid group before deciding to partner with Employer.com Founder Jesse Tinsley for his own offer. Beast and Friends, which includes Roblox CEO David Baszucki, claims to have significantly more than $20 billion to play with, but their pitch is pretty much just “TikTok but on American servers.” Not exactly inspiring stuff, but MrBeast isn’t one to reinvent the wheel.
Maybe the most creative pitch on the table for TikTok comes from the AI-powered search engine Perplexity. Last month, the company made an offer to merge with TikTok. The move would allow TikTok’s investors to retain their equity stakes in the company and would significantly expand the amount of data and information that Perplexity has at its fingertips for its models. The deal would require bringing in new American-based financial backers and would probably be the most complicated to complete.
File this one as extremely unlikely, but Elon Musk’s name has been floated as one potential option for purchasing TikTok. He’s refuted it, saying that he has no interest in buying the platform and has not made a formal bid. Allegedly, though, Musk is a preferred choice among Chinese officials. Obviously, he would have an inside track on a deal, given his proximity to the White House, but god could you imagine how insufferable the app would become under his ownership? It’s bad enough that every third post on X is from him thanks to his alleged algorithm rigging. Now imagine that but in video form. Yeesh, pass.
If the Trump administration opts for a deal that doesn’t fully get China to divest of TikTok, Blackstone might be the play. Late last month, the private equity firm offered to take a small stake in the company as a way to reduce Chinese ownership. It’d likely be joined by other American investors to push China into a minority stake. It’d be the most boring option, which probably makes it more likely to happen.
Another big player capable of making a full takeover bid if it wants, Microsoft looms large in the TikTok sweepstakes. It has wanted to get on the social media game for quite a while and was involved in an attempted deal to buy the company back in 2020 that very quickly collapsed. Microsoft hasn’t made much noise regarding its interest in the platform since then, but Trump threw the company’s name out back in January as a potential buyer.
As mentioned earlier, Amazon made a last-minute bid on TikTok. On paper, it’s a partnership that makes a lot of sense. Amazon could migrate TikTok to American servers via AWS, and it’d love to get its hands on all the cash that is flowing into the TikTok Shop as retail has turned into a major profit center for TikTok. But word is the company’s bid is not considered serious. It’s probably more of an opportunistic attempt to sneak into the mix.
OnlyFans founder Tim Stokely reportedly submitted a bid at the last minute to take over TikTok. Stokely is partnering with Hbar Foundation, which manages the treasury for the Hedera cryptocurrency network. According to Reuters, he deal would involve Stokely’s company Zoop, a publishing platform for creators to connect with audiences. They apparently have some big backers behind them and have plans to turn TikTok into a more creator-friendly platform. That sounds great, but a partnership between Zoop, Hbar, and Hedera sounds like a Silicon Valley bit. They all sound made up.

People love eggs. They're a grocery staple. But in the first few months of 2025, the average price of eggs in the United States reached $6 per dozen, double what they cost at the same point last year. The main reason behind the increase is the spread of the avian flu, which has led to the killing of about 170 million birds in the United States. Fewer hens mean fewer eggs on the market, driving prices up. And now there's a new fear: For the first time ever, bird flu's been found in cows.

21,2025-04-02,"Visa has reportedly offered to hand over $100 million to Apple in order to take over payment processing for its credit card, replacing Mastercard. The offer comes as Apple is in the process of replacing Goldman Sachs as the issuing bank of Apple Card after that company decided to get out of the consumer lending business.
The offer was reported on Tuesday by the Wall Street Journal, which says that American Express is among others trying to win the deal; Mastercard is trying to retain the business. Credit card processors like Visa and Mastercard communicate transactions between the bank of the customer and the retailer and take a small cut of each transaction. Visa previously threw out cash to become the payment processor for Costco’s credit card.
Apple introduced its credit card back in 2019 as a way to increase loyalty and generate a new stream of revenue. It does this by taking a cut of those transaction fees as well as slicing off a portion of earnings from the high-yield savings accounts it offers through Goldman. Goldman reportedly decided to end its relationship with Apple because it was bleeding cash by offering the card to customers with low credit scores, something Apple had demanded. It also could not charge annual fees for the Apple Card, something many premium credit cards come with these days. Goldman was desperate to get into consumer lending during the pandemic, and Apple essentially fleeced the bank.
Still, the WSJ reports that Apple Card customers are carrying $20 billion in balances, suggesting whoever takes over the business could stand to earn a lot of money if they can manage it better than Goldman.
Financial companies are also worried that Apple could further cut them out of the business if it decides to take control of even more of the payments stack; Apple traditionally likes to control every aspect of its products:
But thereâs a much bigger picture with Apple. The tech giant is increasingly becoming the epicenter of many consumersâ daily payments and other financial habits. Big banks and networks for years have been wary of Appleâs ambitions and have developed a frenemy relationship, taking steps to keep the tech giant from making more inroads in consumer finance, while seeking to be close to Apple.
The network that locks in this deal is expecting to stay close to Appleâs future payments efforts.
Late last year, Apple and Goldman were hit with an $89 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over problems with the roll-out of the Apple Card, including poor customer support and unclear terms for its zero-interest finance deals on purchases of items from Apple’s website. The CFPB reported that cardholders assumed all purchases from Apple.com made using the card were eligible for zero-interest financing, when in fact cardholders needed to use the Safari browser and select a specific option at checkout the get the deal.
Apple’s credit card is a fine product, but there are other credit cards on the market that offer better perksâand do not require cardholders to use an iPhone. Apple forces customers to use Apple Pay in order to get 2% cashback on spend (select merchants offer 3% back); using the physical card only earns 1% cashback. The card also does not offer perks of other cards, like purchase protection or access to exclusive lounges.
The fact of the matter is that there are a multitude of other credit cards out there that offer the same exact cashback as Apple Card in addition to other benefits and do not leave users locked in the Apple ecosystem.

""Snafu: Situation normal, all f—d up.""

        Stephan Loerke, CEO of the World Federation of Advertisers, dropped this f-bomb — part of an acronym coined by the US military during the Second World War — onstage at the ING Arena at the trade body's recent flagship event in Brussels. He said it was an apt way to describe how marketers feel three months into 2025.
    

        Yet marketers will often say they're at their most creative when they're under pressure. (Just don't mention cutting their budgets.)
    

        The duality was on full display at the glitzy conflab, replete with snazzy onstage graphics and a house band playing electropop in between sessions. Speakers from brands like Mastercard, L'Oral, and Kraft Heinz painted an optimistic vision to the 2,000-strong audience about how marketers could position their companies for growth, despite the tectonic shifts happening around them.
    

        Between the prospects of tariffs, inflation, the rising cost of living, global conflicts, political polarization, and the disruptive impact of AI, there's a lot for a CMO to keep on top of.
    

        Almost all (99%) of the roughly 600 marketers polled in a recent survey from the WFA and the consultancy firm Oxford said economic and geopolitical uncertainty — and the need to quickly adjust priorities and budgets — would be important or more important in the next five years. Roughly two-thirds (68%) said they'd anticipate these pressures would grow.
    

        One knock-on effect of that is ad budgets are likely to take a hit. Marketing is often the first department to feel the impact of cost cuts. In separate reports last month, analysts from Madison and Wall, as well as Magna Global, trimmed their US ad market forecasts for 2025.
    

        Backstage, Loerke told me that many marketers felt the uncertainty was at an inflection point, which was driving conversations about how to prove marketing's value as CMOs prepare for a tough year.
    

        ""Usually, when that conversation starts, it means that actually there's a recession coming,"" said Loerke, a former marketer at L'Oral in the 1990s.
    

        I interviewed six top global CMOs and spoke with other marketing execs attending the Brussels event to get a sense of what's top of mind for marketers as they navigate the turbulence.
    

        Many marketers are spending a significant portion of their time locked in scenario-planning meetings with their CEOs, chief finance officers, and other members of the C-suite.
    

        ""Back in the day, when I started in the business, it was an A plan and a B plan,"" said Diana Frost, global chief growth officer at Kraft Heinz. ""Well, that's a C plan and a D plan now.""
    

        With the costs of raw materials going up, marketers in sectors like consumer goods and food are having to make rapid-fire decisions about prices, packaging, and product formulations. Consumers' willingness to pay more at the checkout is often partly determined by years of brand-building designed to make them choose one product over another.
    

        Patrik Hansson, EVP of marketing and innovation at the dairy company Arla Foods, said that while companies may encounter a year with disappointing growth, it's important for CMOs to stick to their plans — a five-year horizon rather than a six-month horizon, say — to ensure their marketing has a long-term impact.
    

        ""If you have a way forward, then a bit of noise, a bit of turbulence doesn't distract you from the long term, and that's what we're trying to focus on because otherwise, you get lost in this,"" Hansson told me.
    

        Over coffees, canaps, and cocktails, job security was a hot topic at the event.
    

        A February survey published Tuesday from Duke University's Fuqua School of Business found that 63% of the 281 US marketing leaders polled felt increased pressure from their chief finance officers, up from 52% in 2023.
    

        ""One of the big problems is that the advertisers themselves are shedding people in an attempt to cut costs, so CMOs are risk-averse and look for signs of success that are supposedly measurable,"" Nick Manning, founder of the media consultancy Encyclomedia, who was in attendance, told me after the event.
    

        ""Saying 'trust me, it'll work' doesn't play in a world where short-term is the only term,"" Manning added.
    

        Diageo is often seen across the industry as a poster child for demonstrating marketing effectiveness.
    

        In 2023, it began working with a tech company called CreativeX. CreativeX uses artificial intelligence to generate a ""creative quality score"" that predicts whether digital marketing assets will be effective.
    

        The drinks giant is also using an AI listening tool, developed with its partners Share Creative and Kantar, to predict consumer trends. One insight: 2025 is the year of ""zebra striping,"" in which consumers cut down on their alcohol consumption by alternating between alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.
    

        Diageo's marketers also use an internal tool called Catalyst to get immediate access to data to help them make planning decisions.
    

        ""I want our marketers to have a business mindset and delve into the insights we can now access to plan spend, design campaigns, create content, and collaborate with partners based on what scenario best delivers the brand-building outcome that drives growth,"" said Cristina Diezhandino, Diageo's chief marketing officer.
    

        At Kraft Heinz, Frost wants to instill a sense of swagger and pride within the marketing department — and she's got the receipts to back it up. The Heinz brand, in particular, has marked compound annual revenue growth of 6% over the past two years, adding around $600 million in top-line growth to the broader Kraft Heinz business, Frost said. She credits the creation of its internal digital ad agency, ""The Kitchen,"" and also the repeatable frameworks it's put in place for Heinz marketers around the world to help grow the brand further.
    

        ""When you have these proof points of growth, then you can build the pride, then you can build the momentum of how it's actually possible as you roll it out to the rest of the portfolio, "" Frost said.
    

        ""Brand safety"" was the elephant in the room at the event.
    

        Unspoken but present were lawsuits filed by Elon Musk's X and the video platform Rumble, plus a Jim Jordan-led House Judiciary Committee investigation. These took aim at the WFA's now-shuttered voluntary initiative, the Global Alliance of Responsible Media, and more than a dozen of its advertiser members. The lawsuits and the probe, which are ongoing, allege GARM's members illegally colluded to boycott platforms like X and Rumble. While GARM closed, which the WFA said was due to its limited resources, the WFA has said it adhered to competition rules and would prove so in court. The WFA told me in Brussels it didn't want to discuss the matter.
    

        (Side note: For all its glamour, the WFA's event had been originally due to take place at the far-flung locale of Mumbai, India, but after the legal troubles arose, it was shifted to Brussels, where the WFA is headquartered. The WFA partnered with the local advertising trade body, the UBA, to run the main show.)
    

        While GARM was off limits, marketers did open up about another topic that's become newly contentious, particularly in corporate America: the anti-woke movement and the vocal backlash against diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.
    

        Gael de Talhouet, VP of brand building at the Swedish hygiene company Essity, said marketers should be mindful that ""a brand is not a political stage.""
    

        ""It's something where you tell people about the good you bring to the world,"" he added.
    

        Rupen Desai, CMO and venture partner of the Una Terra Early Growth Fund, said the recent DEI rollbacks had revealed two types of companies: those where DEI was hard-coded into the company's economic model and those that were investing in these sorts of programs just because everyone else was.
    

        For the second type of company, Desai said the recent movements are a ""huge sigh of relief.""
    

        ""When you're grappling with growth, or the lack of it, and this investment isn't really yet showing results, it's probably easier to take a step back,"" Desai said.
    

        But he added: ""The companies who continue on this journey will be bigger winners than the ones who took a step forward, took a step back.""
    

        As the sun set over the Palais de la Bourse, the former Brussels stock exchange, where the event's gala dinner was held, the mood was buoyant, despite the complexities the people in the vast dining room were having to navigate this year. (And sure, perhaps the frequently topped-up wine, exquisitely cooked duck, and performance from the French comedy TikTok creators Supermassive helped a tiny bit.)
    

        CMOs are complex creatures, after all, as David Wheldon, the new WFA president and chief brand officer of the lottery group Allwyn, summed up.
    

        ""A marketer has to have this strange combination of optimism and belief in what you're doing personally, and belief in what you're doing for your company and your customers — and you have to be aware of the context you're in,"" Wheldon said. ""If you flip-flop because the context is changing rapidly, then you cause yourself a problem.""

24,2025-04-02,"Yes, you can buy one right now.
The RTX 5070 Ti is now readily available, and the GIGABYTE GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Eagle OC SFF 16G is back in stock at Amazon, at probably the best price you're going to get right now. Sitting at $899.99, this compact yet powerful GPU is a solid choice for those looking to upgrade.
$899.99
See here
For $900. it's priced like a top-tier card because, well, it is. But considering how often this thing disappears from shelves, the real surprise is that it's buyable at all. Note, you'll need a Prime membership to access this one, but you can secure a free trial via Amazon to cover you this time.
The 5070 Ti runs on NVIDIA's new Blackwell architecture and supports DLSS 4, so it's overqualified for just about anything you throw at it. You're looking at 16GB of GDDR7, a 256-bit bus, and enough bandwidth to keep your games smooth even when your ambition outpaces your build.
Clock speeds hit 2600 MHz, which helps explain why this card performs like it has something to prove. The WINDFORCE cooling system keeps things cool without sounding like a jet engine, which is appreciated when your rig isn’t doubling as a white noise machine.
It also plays nice with smaller cases. This one’s SFF ready, which is rare for a card with this kind of muscle. PCIe 5.0 support is here too, so it’s ready for the next motherboard you inevitably convince yourself you need.
And no, the low review count doesn't mean it's bad. It means most people haven't had the chance to buy one. Granted it's not really worth upgrading from RTX 4070 Ti but the demand is high, the stock is low, and you know how that usually ends.

26,2025-04-02,"Apple is still exploring solid-state buttons with haptic feedback for a future iPhone, according to a new report from a known Weibo leaker.
In a new post, the leaker known as ""Instant Digital"" said that Apple's work on solid-state buttons for the ‌iPhone‌ is ongoing. They said that production cost is not the project's main issue, but rather ""mistouches,"" since a correct response is apparently not ""perfectly guaranteed."" 
Apple is said to currently be adjusting the ""tactile design"" of its solid-state buttons and working on their long-term reliability, especially for mass production. Apple's current button design is integrated directly into the frame, with no rebound when clicked, but the company is apparently seeking to more closely replicate the experience of a traditional mechanical button.
The advantages of the design are simplicity and reducing mechanical wear, while enabling users to differentiate between a light press and a firm press to trigger different functions. The project is purportedly now ""on hold,"" with the company determining that the current market is more interested in display and battery technology advancements. 
It was widely reported that Apple was intending to bring solid-state buttons to the iPhone 15 Pro in 2023 as part of ""Project Bongo,"" but it canceled the plan at a late stage. They were then rumored to come to the iPhone 16 Pro, before being shelved indefinitely. The feature is not expected to arrive in the iPhone 17 lineup, but the latest report suggests that they're likely to appear someday in the future.

27,2025-04-02,"​​Sony is updating its AV lineup today with some significant new Bravia products.
​​Sony is updating its AV lineup today with some significant new Bravia products.
by  Sam Byford
Sony has a replacement for its current flagship QD-OLED TV, the extremely well-received A95L. That’s the model that was crowned “King of TV” at last year’s Value Electronics TV Shootout, which Verge editor-in-chief Nilay Patel served on the judging panel for.
The new model is called the Bravia 8 II. Sony claims that it has 125 percent the peak brightness of the A95L and 150 percent of last year’s Bravia 8, which will remain on sale as an OLED-but-not-QD option. It has a similar design to the A95L, and Sony even says it’ll be cheaper — though pricing information won’t be shared until later in spring. 
The guiding mission of the Bravia lineup, according to Sony, is to deliver the most authentic cinema experience possible in the living room. Yosuke Nakano, from the company’s product planning department, claims the Bravia 8 II has the “most faithful reproduction of the professional monitor look of any TV in the industry.”
To that end, at a recent demonstration session at its Tokyo headquarters, Sony put the Bravia 8 II up against the A95L, Samsung’s S95D, and LG’s G4, along with even more formidable competition: Sony’s own BVM-HX3110 reference monitor, which you’d normally find on movie sets and studios for the most accurate HDR color grading possible. 
If you haven’t seen one of these in person before, I kind of recommend not seeking one out, because it will ruin all other screens for you. It costs nearly $40,000 and has 4,000 nits peak brightness. It looks absolutely out of control, and I would dearly love to have one on my desk.
That’s what Sony is shooting for with the Bravia 8 II. Does it get there? Well, no. The BVM-HX3110’s higher brightness gives HDR footage an almost surreal look thanks to its finer control over contrast. But in each TV’s filmmaker mode, which is supposed to deliver the most accurate color possible, Sony got much closer than Samsung or LG. As the owner of a couple of LG OLEDs myself, I was actually a little surprised at how washed out and green-tinted the G4 tended to look in comparison. 
Now, Sony won’t have chosen demo footage that might trip up its own displays, and it’s also at an obvious advantage when it comes to emulating the color reproduction of the BVM-HX3110. But Sony really is the market leader for reference monitors by some distance, so that still feels like a fair and relevant target. I would not be shocked if the Bravia 8 II turns out to be another winner by “King of TV” metrics.
Sony is also updating several other products in its home theater range. The Bravia 5 rounds out Sony’s lineup by bringing Mini LED backlighting to the midrange — it’s replacing the X90L, which uses full-array local dimming rather than Mini LED, and consequently Sony says the Bravia 5 has up to six times more dimming zones. This line comes in sizes from 55 to 98 inches, the upper end of which is larger than any OLED Sony sells. 
Sony showed off the Bravia 5 against the X90L as well as Samsung’s QN85D “QLED” set. Also part of this demonstration was the BVM-HX310 reference monitor, which is similar to the BVM-HX3110 but “only” reaches 1,000 nits peak brightness. 
The Bravia 5’s control over backlighting and blooming was clearly better than its predecessor, and it looked to be a more robust solution than Samsung’s as well. Sony also made a point of demonstrating its AI noise reduction feature, which is the kind of thing I’d normally run away from but have to admit was quite impressive — it did a good job of cleaning up old footage from Friends and Home Alone in real time. 
Unsurprisingly, the Bravia 5 couldn’t come close to the BVM-HX310, since Mini LED still suffers in comparison to OLED when it comes to blooming and viewing angles. It also won’t match the Bravia 7, which is staying in the lineup and offers 100 percent the brightness and 25 percent more dimming zones. But at least in this demonstration, the Bravia 5 made the most convincing attempt to reproduce colors and contrast as well as you could reasonably expect from a mid-range Mini LED TV.
Sony is also introducing a new entry-level TV for the US, somewhat confusingly called the Bravia 2 II; the original Bravia 2 wasn’t actually sold in the US before. This is a fairly standard LED TV that comes in sizes from 43 to 77 inches, but you’ll get similar image processing and software integration to the rest of Sony’s Bravia range.
If you’re more of a projector person, Sony is adding the new Bravia Projector 7 to its range, joining the higher-end 8 and 9 models. The Projector 7 is pretty close to them spec-wise, reaching 2,200 nits in brightness and supporting 4K 120Hz. One difference is that the 7 has a “standard” lens, not the “advanced crisp-focused” optics seen in the 8 and 9. 
The Bravia Projector 7 is replacing the well-reviewed VPL-XW5000ES, which is a $6,000 projector, so even though this is an entry-level product it’s an entry to a very expensive category. Still, it did look impressive in a demo against its closest competition from JVC, so I’d expect this to be a strong option for people considering a home theater setup. 
Finally, Sony is introducing some new audio options to integrate with its Bravia TVs. The Bravia Theater Bar 6 is a 3.1.2 soundbar with upward-firing speakers, the Bravia Theater System 6 is a 5.1 setup-in-a-box with a less capable soundbar, and the Bravia Theater Rear 8 is a pair of wireless rear speakers. All of these products can be paired to Bravia TVs and controlled with the Bravia Connect mobile app.
As mentioned, Sony doesn’t yet have pricing details for any of its new Bravia products — that’ll come sometime this spring.

28,2025-04-02,"Investors greeted President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs less than enthusiastically, sending the Magnificent 7 and other stocks lower. Futures linked to the the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average point to a lower opening Thursday.
For the Mag 7, stock price declines in post-market trading were 4.7% for Apple (AAPL), 3.8% for Amazon (AMZN), 3.7% for Meta (META), 3.6% for Tesla (TSLA), 3.2% for Nvidia (NVDA), 1.7% for Microsoft (MSFT), and 2.4% for Google’s parent, Alphabet (GOOGL). 
Palantir (PLTR) fell 5.2%. General Motors (GM) and Stellantis (STLA) also moved lower.
“One big question was: Did Trump really mean to impose the tariffs” or were they a feint aimed at drawing concessions, said Melissa Brown, head of investment decision research at SimCorp (SIM). “From what he said, it does seem more likely that he’s actually going to impose them. It’s not just talk.”
That said, the implementation and effects of the tariffs are still not 100% clear, which will make it difficult for CEOs to plan, Brown told Quartz. The tariffs also make the Federal Reserve’s job much difficult because the levies could both increase costs and depress output.
“I don’t think a trade war is particularly good for the stock market,” Brown said. “It’s not the death knell for the U.S. economy, but it could be very harmful for pockets of it.” 
The baseline 10% tariff on all countries will go into effect Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET; the reciprocal levies are scheduled for enactment on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET.
China will be hit with 34% tariffs, while the European Union will be slapped with 20% duties, according to a graph Trump held up at a news conference. Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan will be hit with respective duties of 32%, 24%, and 26%. Existing import taxes on Canadian and Mexican goods won’t be affected, with exemptions for USMCA-compliant products continuing.
Trump’s tariffs will close the de minimis exemption that allows small-value packages to be shipped directly, duty-free. The shares of PDD (PDD), which owns Chinese shopping site Temu — a beneficiary of the current system — fell 4.9% in post-market trading.
David Wagner, portfolio manager and head of equities at Aptus Capital, was less concerned about the tariffs, saying they’ll only affect about 15% of the economy — which continues to benefit from consumer strength and a strong labor market.
“There’s a buffer here where consumers can absorb the tariffs and continue to spend,” Wagner said. He added that the strong dollar will help moderate the duties’ impact and that there’s “no playbook” for this situation. 
“No one knows the ramifications of tariffs and the threats and how other countries will react,” Wagner said.

29,2025-04-02,"OpenAI recently raised $40 billion through its latest funding round led by SoftBank to bolster its AI advances and research.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Microsoft has seemingly taken a backseat from its multi-billion-dollar partnership with OpenAI, especially after the ChatGPT maker announced its $500 billion commitment to its Stargate project alongside SoftBank.
The move stormed the tech industry with Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff predicting that Microsoft won't use OpenAI in the future for its AI efforts.
While Microsoft has since lost its exclusive cloud provider status with OpenAI, it holds the “right of first refusal,” making it the first option to host OpenAI workloads in its cloud infrastructure and services.
Microsoft has been intimately involved in OpenAI's funding rounds, raising $6.6 billion alongside NVIDIA, Thrive Capital, and SoftBank in the ChatGPT maker's funding round from late last year. This saved OpenAI from the cusp of making a $5 billion loss within 12 months, which would have manifested into bankruptcy.
More recently, OpenAI closed its latest round of funding, where it managed to raise $40 billion from investors, pushing its market cap to $300 billion (via CNBC). It's arguably ""the largest private tech funding round on record,"" according to PitchBook.
Interestingly, SoftBank led the round with $30 billion, with the remaining $10 billion raised by key investors, including Microsoft and Thrive Capital. OpenAI will leverage the raised funds to scale greater heights in AI scaling and development.

In a report by The Wall Street Journal (WSJ), SoftBank might be biting a little bit more than it can chew with its exorbitant investment in OpenAI. According to the outlet, $10 billion of SoftBank's mega investment will be borrowed from Japanese bank Mizuho.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
The $10 billion deal is expected to be completed in April, while the remaining amount is set to come by early 2026. SoftBank is betting big on OpenAI, indicating that we're on the verge of a new phase led by artificial intelligence. In fact, SoftBank believes OpenAI is ""closest to achieving Artificial General Intelligence.""
However, financial experts are skeptical about the future of AI and its profitability. According to Ratings agency S&P Global, ""SoftBank’s financial condition will likely deteriorate."" The agency attributes its deductions to SoftBank's investment in OpenAI, which will likely plunge it into debt and dismal ratings.
To this end, AI labs have struggled to establish clear profitability in the landscape. Experts suggest investor interest is quickly fading, which could be an indication that they'll soon channel their funds elsewhere. Interestingly, they predict Microsoft could acquire OpenAI within the next 3 years.

    The company's Kompanio Ultra chip can support tomorrow's generative AI-powered helpers, MediaTek says.
  
MediaTek has released chips to power Android phones for years and broken into the laptop PC space in recent times too. Now, it's got a new chip aimed at another market -- Chromebooks -- to empower those affordable machines to connect to the latest generative artificial intelligence agents.
Previous MediaTek chips in the Kompanio line powered Chromebooks like the Lenovo Duet 11. Its new silicon, the Kompanio Ultra, brings faster speeds and better generative AI performance to affordable ChromeOS-powered laptops. In the arms race to empower portable PCs with artificial intelligence, MediaTek's chip aims to make cheaper machines capable of handling cutting-edge ""AI agents"" that use generative AI to anticipate user needs.
""We worked closely with Google to ensure the newest Chromebook Plus devices enjoy next-generation on-device AI capabilities, superior performance per watt and immersive multimedia,"" said Adam King, MediaTek VP and GM of computing and multimedia.
In a briefing, MediaTek boasted benchmarks that pitted its new Kompanio Ultra chip against the Intel Core Ultra 5 125U chip (which powers laptops like the Lenovo ThinkBook 14 2-in-1 Gen 4), saying its Chromebook silicon performs better in devices to get over 4 hours longer battery life and up to 40% faster GPU performance in the GFXBench Manhattan benchmark. The Kompanio Ultra's NPU is capable of up to 50 trillion operations per second (a metric of AI performance), which is nearly five times greater than the 11 TOPS of the Intel Core Ultra 5 125U, MediaTek said.
The Kompanio Ultra inherits a lot of DNA from MediaTek's latest mobile chip, the Dimensity 9400, which was introduced last fall as part of the company's big push to enable AI agents in phones. But the Kompanio's different software and drivers specialize it for Chromebooks, even if its higher performance capabilities put it more in line with Google's Chromebook Plus requirements for ChromeOS laptops empowered by the search giant's Gemini AI."

32,2025-04-02,"Happy Liberation Day to those who celebrate. The market appears to have belatedly joined the festivities.
The major stock indices briefly slid in the morning before rebounding later in the day and closing higher. The S&P 500 rose 0.9%, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 236 points or 0.6%.
 After the market close Wednesday, President Donald Trump is expected to unveil import taxes on almost all U.S. trading partners. The market consensus is “tariffs averaging around 10% announced on roughly 50% of U.S. goods imports,” according to a Citi (C) report. However, The Wall Street Journal (NWSA) has reported that the White House was considering tariffs as high as 20%.
Investors’ reaction will likely depend on the final rates and whether the duties take effect immediately or are delayed, Citi analysts noted. Even at 20%, however, some analysts are downplaying the potential boost to inflation.
“Consumers would substitute towards domestically produced alternatives, and retailers would absorb some of the cost, Pantheon Macroeconomics economists Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen wrote in a note on Wednesday. “So an extra 20% tariff on all imports probably would lift the core PCE deflator by, say, 1¼%.” 
Some analysts warned that the tariffs’ unpopularity abroad could have consequences for the U.S. economy.
Melissa Brown, managing director of investment decision research at SimCorp, said in written comments that Trump’s rhetoric and policies may trigger backlash against U.S.-made goods and inbound tourism, ultimately slowing economic growth.
Her concerns align with those of Goldman Sachs economists, who warned earlier that Trump’s trade policies and declining U.S. favorability abroad are leading to boycotts and reduced tourism, potentially dragging down GDP by 0.2% to 0.3%— based on similar downturns during the Iraq War and Trump’s first term.
Should tariffs contribute to an economic slowdown in the U.S., the effects could be global.
“If the U.S. enters a recession because investment stalls under uncertainty and real wages get depressed by tariffs and a weaker labor market, then foreign export-heavy economies would be crushed,” Yardeni Research said in a note to clients.
U.S. growth is holding up so far. Employers added 155,000 jobs in March, more than expected, increasing from an upwardly revised 84,000 in February, the ADP (ADP) survey showed on Wednesday. Factory orders gained 0.6% in February, better than the consensus estimate but slowing from an upwardly revised 1.8% in January.

33,2025-04-02,"Senate passes Democrats' resolution to block tariffs on Canada with GOP help.
Democrats on Wednesday vowed to fight President Donald Trump's tariffs ""tooth and nail"" and criticized his policies as having started an ""absurd, crazy, chaotic trade war.""
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer held a news conference just hours before Trump's big tariff reveal, where he urged Republicans to join Senate Democrats on a measure to block tariffs on Canadian goods.
Four of them did -- GOP Sens. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitch McConnell and co-sponsor Rand Paul -- as it passed by a 51-48 vote. Republican Sen. Roger Marshall did not vote and all Senate Democrats voted for it.
The resolution needed only a simple majority of votes to pass the Senate and it now heads to the House. But there's nothing to compel House Speaker Mike Johnson to take it up, so it's unlikely to further progress. The Senate also fell far short of the number of votes that would ultimately be necessary to bust a Trump veto if the bill ever got to his desk.
“Speaker Johnson already declared [Democratic] Senator [Tim] Kaine’s resolution dead on arrival in the House of Representatives. It will never make it to President Trump’s desk,"" Republican Whip Sen. John Barrasso said in a statement after the vote. “This meaningless messaging resolution will not stop Senate Republicans from making America’s communities safer.”
Still, the passage of the bill is a boon to efforts to challenge Trump's tariffs just hours after he announced then.
The resolution would end the national emergency declaration against Canada, thereby curtailing Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs. His emergency declaration was based in concerns about the flow of fentanyl over the Canadian border to the United States.
Democrats have said that while the agree that fentanyl is an issue, the issue does not stem from Canada.
""Considering the Canadian border to be an emergency is preposterous,"" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., said.
Before the vote, Schumer said of Senate Republicans, ""They know [the tariffs are] a tax hike on the American people. They know that the stock market is in turmoil, risking people's retirements. They know that consumer confidence is down and the odds of a recession --- something people hate, it's harder to find a job, keep a job, maintain your weekly budget if a recession occurs -- and now our greatest financial prognosticators are saying the chances of recession because of these tariffs, this tariff tax, goes way up.
""So, we're going to fight these tariffs tooth and nail. Trump's done a lot of bad things. This is way up there,"" Schumer said.
Trump, in an early morning post on his social media platform, pressured Republicans to oppose the measure -- going so far as to call out some specific members of his party by name.
""Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Rand Paul, also of Kentucky, will hopefully get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change,"" he wrote on his social media platform.
The president added the bill ""is just a ploy of the Dems to show and expose the weakness of certain Republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the House will never approve it and I, as your President, will never sign it.""
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries also preemptively slammed Trump's tariffs, saying they will make goods more costly.
""This is not Liberation Day. It's Recession Day in the United States of America,"" Jeffries said. ""That's what the Trump tariffs are going to do.""
Top House Republicans, meanwhile, expressed confidence in Trump ahead of this Rose Garden unveiling. Though they admitted their may be some ""short-term pain"" as a result.
""I trust the president's instincts,"" Johnson said when asked by ABC News if he's concerned. ""We are fully supportive of his initiatives, and we'll see how it all shakes out.""
""The president talked in the State of the Union that that may be some short-term pain, ultimately, long term we're going to get more things made in America, and we're going to get fair treatment of America by other countries,"" said Majority Leader Steve Scalise.

Asian equities had a quiet night on light volumes, as global investors sit on the sidelines in advance of Wednesday’s can’t-miss TV: tariff announcements.
The Philippines managed a +1% gain, while Indonesia and Pakistan remain closed for Eid al-Fitr. Hong Kong and Mainland China bounced around the room, posting small gains on light volumes as Mainland China’s volume dipped below the RMB 1 trillion value traded level for the first time since January 13. Markets were quite resilient, in my opinion, though foreign ownership of the space remains low.
Xiaomi fell -4.19% and was Hong Kong’s most heavily traded stock, trading 3X the value of the second most heavily traded. This is following the fatal crash involving their SU7 electric vehicle. The crash and investigation are giving investors a reason to take profits after the stock had risen +257% since Apr. 2, 2024, to its 52-week high on Mar. 19, 2025. Mainland investors bought the Xiaomi dip today via Southbound Stock Connect. Mainland-listed EV battery maker CATL gained +0.03% after announcing the Xiaomi crash vehicle did not have a CATL battery in it, while also announcing a partnership with Sinopec to develop 500 EV battery swap stations with a goal of 10,000 in total.
Mainland investors bought a healthy $1.5 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, accounting for 43% of Hong Kong turnover.
Hong Kong-listed EV names, other than Xiaomi and BYD, had a good day following March sales data, as Leapmotor gained +12.98% and Geely Auto gained +4.69% after announcing stronger-than-expected sales numbers.
Hong Kong-listed internet stocks were higher after the National Financial Regulatory Administration, the Ministry of Science & Technology, and the National Development and Reform Commission all announced policy support for financial firms to “leverage advanced technologies including cloud computing, big data, and artificial intelligence.”
Alibaba gained +0.15% on reports that its open-source large language model is growing in popularity. After the close, Alibaba announced that it repurchased 6 million U.S.-listed shares in Q1, at a cost of $600 million, and 150 million U.S.-listed shares for the year ended 3/31/2025, at a cost of $11.9 billion.
Internet stocks overall had mixed performance overnight. Tencent was flat after buying back 996,000 shares today, Meituan fell -0.06%, Kuaishou gained +2.32%, JD.com gained +0.43%, Trip.com gained +0.08%, NetEase gained +0.43% and Baidu +1.12%.
Healthcare names were lower in both Hong Kong and Mainland China on profit-taking after strong moves in recent sessions. Wuxi AppTec fell -0.94% after selling 50.8 million shares of Wuxi XDC, which fell -6.85%, raising HKD 2.2 billion.
Mainland defensive plays such as banks and insurance outperformed, while energy and technology hardware were off as investors worried about the consequences tariffs could have on the global economy. Precious metals and mining were also off. All told, it was a quiet night, though I doubt the next one will be. Hopefully, tariffs do not end up being as bad as anticipated, which could cause a relief rally. Remember, the most crowded trade is not China equities; rather, it is U.S. equities.
There has been shockingly little discussion of the last time the U.S. government implemented high tariffs: the 1920s and 1930s. I have not read John Steinbeck’s “The Grapes of Wrath” since high school, but it left a strong impression on me. My father’s experience growing up in the 1930s and 1940s also had a significant impact on our family (save, save, save; no debt, no loans, no credit cards; spend as little as possible). Below is the Dow Jones Industrial Average versus the average U.S. tariff rate during the 1920s and 1930s. You can come to your own conclusions, though the market seemed to fall in advance of the tariffs being implemented as regime change causes market uncertainty. It is also worth noting that the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was passed in June 1930, after the 1929 stock market crash. Yes, things are different today. I only bring it up because no one else appears to be.

The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes diverged to close -0.02% and +0.35%, respectively, on volume that decreased -13.44% from Tuesday, which is 129% of the 1-year average; 177 stocks advanced, while 302 stocks declined. Main Board short turnover decreased -15.5% from Tuesday, which is 129% of the 1-year average, as 15% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). Growth, value, and small caps outperformed momentum, dividends, quality, and large caps. The top-performing sectors were Consumer Staples, which gained +1.1%; Financials, which gained +0.87%; and Utilities, which gained +0.65%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Information Technology, which fell -2.48%; Materials, which fell -1.84%; and Healthcare, which fell -0.62%. The top-performing subsectors were consumer staples distribution, food, and construction materials, while national defense, household/personal products, and technology hardware were among the worst-performing. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were three times pre-stimulus levels, as Mainland investors bought a net $1.5 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, led by Xiaomi and Alibaba, which were large net buys, Tencent, Semiconductor Manufacturing International (SMIC), Leapmotor, and Xpeng.

Momentum, value, dividends, and large caps “outperformed” (i.e. fell less than) the growth factor and small caps. Financials and Information Technology were the only positive sectors, up +0.69% and +0.11%, respectively. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Healthcare, which fell -1.08%, Utilities, which fell -0.73%, and Materials, which fell -0.67%. The top-performing subsectors were the forest industry, construction machinery, and textile/garment industry. Meanwhile, precious metals, aerospace, and energy equipment were among the worst-performing subsectors. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were near their one-year average. CNY and the Asia Dollar Index both fell slightly versus the US dollar. Treasury bonds rallied. Copper fell, and steel rose.

Breakups are hard, even if you're guaranteed to walk away a billionaire.

Melinda French Gates' divorce from Bill Gates was years in the making — and presaged by nightmares and bouts of panic that made her face her feelings, she told People in an interview.
    

        Gates and French Gates announced their split in a joint statement in 2021. In her coming memoir, ""The Next Day,"" she wrote about her feelings leading up to their official divorce. French Gates said she experienced cryptic nightmares beginning in 2019 that left her in a panic. The final blow was a vision of herself plummeting into a void while her family stood on the edge of a cliff.
    

        French Gates wrote that that was the moment she knew it was time for her to make a big life decision on her own. In 2020, she told her then-husband that she wanted to live separately.
    

        ""It was one of the scariest conversations I'd have had,"" she wrote.
    

        However, Gates was ""understanding and respectful"" upon hearing the news, though he was ""sad and upset,"" French Gates wrote. Months later, in the summer of 2020, she asked him for a divorce.
    

        Her panicked feelings didn't end with that revelation. French Gates said she started ""having panic attacks"" in the months during and leading up to their divorce proceedings.
    

        ""Bill has a reputation for being one of the toughest negotiators in the world,"" French Gates wrote.
    

        Their divorce was finalized in August 2021 after ""grueling"" and lengthy proceedings, she wrote in the memoir. She walked away with $6.3 billion worth of Microsoft stock, and her net worth is an estimated $30 billion, Forbes reported.
    

        These days, French Gates is continuing her philanthropic endeavors through her company, Pivotal Ventures, and reportedly dating. Late last year, she was spotted holding hands with Philip Vaughn, an entrepreneur and former Microsoft employee.
    

Correction: April 2, 2025 — Corrects French Gates' estimated net worth to $30 billion, not $30 million.

37,2025-04-02,"Imagine an open world RPG where your actions affect the price of goods, the markets reacting to anything the player may do (burn down wheat fields, cost of food increases; kill the merchants, prices differentiate between cities; sell the many swords you’ve collected on your adventures, tank the sword market). What would it take to have such an adaptive simulated economy? You could take a very simple approach and define a rule like The cost of a good is inversely proportional to the amount of that good in the game. But this will inevitable fail to capture the complex behavior we know economies to have. In order to create the desired emergent behavior, we must think at the level of the individual. By the end of this project we’ll have markets that converge to optimal prices, multiple coupled markets, inflation, geographically distinct economies, and merchants connecting cities, all of which adapts to any possible change in the environment. This work is in part inspired by Simulating Supply and Demand and Emergent Economies for Role Playing Games, both great resources if you want to explore more.
We want a complex economy to emerge from simple actions taken by individuals, so how do people make economic decisions? This is an unimaginably deep question, so we need to start somewhere simple. Below is the motivating example to start off our economic model, but keep in mind there are many other approaches.
You’re checking out a new super market in the neighborhood and see your favorite cereal, but then you see that it costs \$10. “This is madness!” you think. You know that just down the road your usual super market sells the same cereal for \$5, so you don’t buy the cereal. But the next day, at your usual super market, you find the price of cereal is now \$10 as well. “This is unfortunate, but it seems the price of cereal has gone up, darn.” You still decide to buy the cereal since you really like it.
This story outlines a very simple decision making algorithm, which although incomplete, gives us a great place to start. People seem to track two numbers when it comes to the price of a good: How much they personally value a good, and how much they expect that good to cost in the market. In the above story, our individual personally valued the cereal at more then \$10, which we know since they eventually bought the cereal for \$10. But this value alone is not enough to explain our story, if it were, then our individual would have immediately bought the cereal from the first market. Their expected market value of the cereal was much lower then the price they saw, so they knew they could probably buy it somewhere else for much cheaper, and that’s why they didn’t buy the first cereal. These two numbers are where we begin.
We will begin with a single market. Each actor will keep track of how much they personally value a good and how much they expect that good to cost. From here we can tell if they are a buyer or seller: A buyer is someone who personally values a good more then they expect it to cost (for example, if they value a good at \$10 and expect it to cost \$8 in the market, then they are a buyer of that good), and a seller is someone who values a good less then what they expect it to cost in the market.
This very first simulation will be as simple as possible, no money is given in a trade, no limited goods, no transaction costs, no diminishing returns, nothing except transaction offers. They will attempt to buy and sell with each other at random. But how does the expected market value change over time? In order to have a convergence of prices, we will have the buyer decrease their expected price after a transaction, and sellers increase their price. Essentially, the buyer is thinking “I bought this good for \$10, next time I’ll try and buy it for \$9”, while the seller thinks “I sold this for \$10, next time I’ll try and sell it for \$11”. The opposite happens on a failed transaction, the buyer thinking “I need to offer more next time if I want the good”. Perhaps at some point the buyer even becomes a seller when the expected price overcomes their personal value.
The core of the code is shown below, but I will link the full repository (with commented code if you want to see the finer details.)
With this very simple decision making process we can run our first simulation. We will have 200 actors in this market, each starting with a random personal value and expected value. Below is the graph of expected values (green and red for buyers and sellers respectively) and personal values (pink). I modify actors personal values at different points in time to see how it effects the market.

We see a quick convergence of expected values to what looks like the average of the personal values. Actually, its converging to the median. Our market applies forces that try and balance the number of buyers and sellers, penalizing those who don’t get matched up. Another perspective we can take is to consider the supply demand curves.
Instead of being given the supply and demand curves, we need to derive them. Given that we know peoples personal values, we can determine for some hypothetical price how many people will be buyers and how many sellers. Graphing for every price the number of buyers will give us a demand curve, and similarly with sellers the supply curve. By finding at what price the two curves are equal, we find the theoretical optimal price. Below is again 200 people interacting every frame, some personal values changed at points in time. We add in the theoretical price to the graph (blue), as well as the supply and demand curves.

The basic principal works well! We haven’t set a global price for a good, or set who should buy or sell, and yet we get a functioning economy that converges to the best possible market price and adapts to changes in actors personal values.
Currently we rely on a round based approach, but economies don’t function in these discrete rounds, people buy and sell at random times. People also don’t transact anything at the moment, they just exchange information, but no goods. Both these issues can be easily addressed, but the second will create a new and interesting problem: Scarcity.
 Roundless Currently the economy uses buy/sell rounds in order to match up buyers and sellers, but this won’t work in our final simulation. A simulated RPG economy will have buyers that somewhat ran...
 Multiple Markets Lets start with just two markets. We’ll have wood and chairs, with wood being used to build chairs. But first lets just look at the two markets uncoupled, each with personal values...
 Inflation Everyone seems to know that when the government prints too much money it causes inflation, but why? If everyone suddenly doubled their money, they would be willing to buy more, increasing...

JNJ Stock
 
Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) stock dropped 7% on Tuesday, April 1, following a significant legal setback. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Lopez in Houston rejected the company’s third attempt to resolve its talc-related liabilities through Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The judge determined that J&J had employed a flawed process when seeking votes from personal injury claimants. [1] J&J will now proceed with addressing the pending talc-related lawsuits through the civil court system.
Now that the JNJ stock has seen a 7% fall, does the current price point make it attractive?
Our analysis indicates that JNJ stock is a favorable pick at its current price of approximately $155. While noting some minor concerns, we anticipate upside potential driven by its moderate valuation.
  We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of JNJ stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Johnson & Johnson along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception.
Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, JNJ stock looks moderate  compared to the broader market.

Johnson & Johnson’s Revenues have grown marginally over recent years.
Johnson & Johnson’s profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe.
Johnson & Johnson's balance sheet looks strong.
JNJ stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on JNJ stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Johnson & Johnson Stock Go In A Market Crash? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes.
In summary, Johnson & Johnson's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows:
We believe Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) presents a good buying opportunity at the $155 level, supported by its strong performance across key parameters and a still-moderate valuation. While near-term risks exist, including the impact of tariffs on pharmaceutical companies, broader market uncertainties, and the company's ongoing talc litigations, we believe these are largely accounted for in the current price. This is further underscored by JNJ's current trading multiple of 14x forward expected earnings, which is below its five-year average P/E ratio of 17x.
While it doesn’t look like there is much upside to JNJ stock, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid- and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

39,2025-04-02,"Novo Holdings, the controlling shareholder of Ozempic-maker Novo Nordisk (NVO), nearly doubled its annual income and investment returns in 2024.
The life sciences–focused holding company reported Wednesday that its total income and investment returns reached a record 60 billion Danish krone ($8.7 billion), a 92% jump from 31.2 billion krone ($4.5 billion) the previous year.
“2024 was a successful year for Novo Holdings, not only in terms of financial performance, but also in strengthening our organization with the addition of talented new colleagues,” CEO Kasim Kutay said in a press release. “In 2025, we will build on this momentum, with a particular focus on Asia as we establish an office in India.”
Novo Holdings manages the assets of the Novo Nordisk Foundation and holds a controlling stake in Novo Nordisk, with 77% of voting shares. The Danish pharma company’s revenue surged 26% last year to $40.5 billion, helping drive Novo Holdings’ financial gains.
The holding company expanded its portfolio slightly in 2024, adding 43 new companies while exiting 27. By year’s end, its portfolio comprised 181 companies.
The company’s largest acquisition last year was the drug manufacturer Catalent. As part of the $16.5 billion deal, Novo Holdings agreed to acquire Catalent, while Novo Nordisk purchased three of its manufacturing facilities. The move aimed to ease supply shortages at the time of the company’s weight loss drug Wegovy. Novo Nordisk said the acquisition would boost production capacity starting in 2026. Catalent manufactures nearly 70 billion doses of more than 7,000 products each year.
Despite Novo Holdings’ strong financial performance,  the company saw its total assets under management shrink to $153 billion from $161 billion in 2023, reflecting a drop in Novo Nordisk’s market value. The pharma giant’s stock has fallen 46% over the past 12 months, weighed down by setbacks including clinical trials that failed to meet expectations.

In the world of smartphone photography, technological advancements never fail to impress. The focus has shifted from simply “capturing a shot” in the early days to now “capturing it perfectly,” with competition moving away from hardware specs to algorithm optimization and user experience. The TECNO CAMON 40 Pro 5G aims to make waves in high-speed photography with its FlashSnap Mode and BestMoment AI frame selection. But can it truly compete with flagship rivals like the Apple iPhone 16 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra? Let’s dive into the tech and real-world performance to find out.
The CAMON 40 Pro 5G’s FlashSnap Mode boasts a shutter speed up to 1/11235 seconds, a standout figure on paper. To put that in perspective, the average human blink lasts 1/4 second, meaning the CAMON’s shutter speed is 2600 times faster. This allows the device to effortlessly capture high-speed moments, such as jumps, dunks, or splashing water. While faster shutter speeds may slightly compromise image quality, the difference is negligible in well-lit conditions. Compared to the iPhone 16 Pro and Galaxy S24 Ultra, the CAMON 40 Pro 5G delivers a higher success rate in high-speed photography, particularly excelling in capturing fast-moving subjects.
The BestMoment AI feature is a standout in the CAMON 40 Pro 5G’s imaging system. Within a 0.5-second window both before and after the shutter press, the AI algorithm analyzes the scene and selects the best frame. This is ideal for action shots, like basketball dunks or table tennis strikes, ensuring the expressions are natural.
BestMoment AI’s frame selection is impressively smart. For example, it captures subjects mid-smile rather than mid-blink or on awkward expressions. This attention to detail gives the CAMON 40 Pro 5G an edge over the iPhone 16 Pro and Galaxy S24 Ultra in action photography.
For everyday users, getting the timing right is usually the biggest challenge in photography. The CAMON 40 Pro 5G’s FlashSnap Auto Mode is designed to help users overcome this challenge, automatically snapping photos when the AI detects the perfect moment. This is particularly useful for sports like basketball or badminton, where it captures peak action effortlessly.
While not flawless—occasionally misjudging complex scenes—the feature lowers the barrier to entry, making it easier for anyone to take great shots. Compared to the iPhone 16 Pro and Galaxy S24 Ultra, the CAMON 40 Pro 5G’s FlashSnap Auto Mode is more intuitive for everyday users, especially in dynamic scenarios.
The CAMON 40 Pro 5G leverages AI to enhance RAW data through multi-frame synthesis, effectively balancing highlights and shadows in tough lighting conditions while maintaining detail and minimizing noise. This advanced technology is particularly noteworthy in mid-range devices and excels in low-light scenarios.
When it comes to night photography, the CAMON 40 Pro 5G performs at a level that rivals flagship models. While the iPhone 16 Pro captures a bit more detail, and the Galaxy S24 Ultra distinguishes itself with superior dynamic range and even finer detail retention, making it the standout in this regard, the CAMON 40 Pro 5G overall holds its own against these high-end competitors, showcasing impressive capabilities in its class.
TECNO’s Universal Tone full-spectrum skin tone imaging technology elevates the CAMON 40 Pro 5G’s skin tone capture accuracy with a color card of 372 skin tone patches and an enhanced Multi-Skin Tone Color Restoration Engine. This ensures natural, true-to-life skin tones for users with diverse skin tones including in South and Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East.
Compared to the iPhone 16 Pro and Galaxy S24 Ultra, the CAMON 40 Pro 5G focuses more on localized optimization. For instance, a brand-new region-specific 186-tone color card will be customized for Saudi Arabia, ensuring more precise skin tone reproduction for users in the country, giving the CAMON 40 Pro 5G a competitive edge in this area.
The CAMON 40 Pro 5G showcases impressive innovation and advanced technical capabilities in its AI imaging features. It focuses on accessibility and user-friendly innovation, particularly for its price segment, offering high-end features in a more affordable package.
Equipped with AI Eraser 2.0, the CAMON 40 Pro 5G intelligently detects and removes distracting elements from photos, such as passersby or clutter, allowing the subject to stand out more prominently. This feature greatly enhances the visual impact of photos, especially when shooting in busy tourist spots or crowded public spaces. By effectively cleaning up the image, it helps users achieve cleaner, more professional-looking shots with ease.
The CAMON 40 Pro 5G also introduces the AI Image Extender feature, which uses intelligent algorithms to extend the edges of a photo, providing a wider field of view without altering the original composition. This feature is especially useful for capturing landscapes or architectural shots, offering users greater compositional flexibility and enhancing the spatial depth and narrative of their photos. The ease of use and effectiveness of this feature make it a standout addition, enhancing the overall photo-taking experience for users.
In side-by-side comparisons, the CAMON 40 Pro 5G stands strong against the Apple iPhone 16 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra in both action and night photography.
For daytime action shots, the CAMON’s faster shutter speed and AI frame selection often outperform its competitors. In low-light conditions, it delivers flagship-level performance in color and tone, with the iPhone 16 Pro capturing slightly more detail and the S24 Ultra excelling in dynamic range. Additionally, the CAMON 40 Pro 5G shines in sensitivity and frequency band performance, which are critical for night photography.
Overall, the CAMON 40 Pro 5G proves to be a strong contender in the mid-to-high-end market, offering unique imaging features and localized optimizations."
44,2025-04-02,"It seems the ongoing management changes at Samsung will delay the market arrival of its ambitious super-slim smartphone. The Galaxy S25 Edge was expected to launch mid-way through April, but those plans have seemingly been pushed back by a few weeks. 
According to a report from Korea’s ET News, the company has pushed the launch event to some point between May and June. “It has been confirmed that this information was also conveyed to the three mobile carriers that sell the Galaxy S25 Edge,” says the outlet. 
An insider quoted in the story notes that due to the launch delay, the device may take even longer to go on sale. The report clears that there isn’t any quality issue with the device that has led to the postponement of the launch.
In related news, earlier this month, Google delayed the market arrival of its budget-centric Pixel 9a smartphone due to component performance issues. As per DigiTimes, the company had to rework nearly half a million units to fix the undisclosed issues. 
Armed with a titanium build, the Galaxy S25 Edge is expected to offer Qualcomm’s top-of-the-line Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC. The phone, which is said to be just 5.8mm in thickness, is expected to feature a 6.7-inch OLED display, while the lights are kept on by a fittingly small 3,786 mAh battery. 
Leaks suggest that the Galaxy S25 Edge will deploy a larger vapor chamber cooling system compared to the baseline Galaxy S25. Despite its svelte chassis, the phone could surprise buyers with a massive 200-megapixel main camera, sitting alongside a 12-megapixel camera for ultrawide capture. 
As far as the pricing goes, the latest report from Samsung’s home market mentions an asking price of approximately KRW 1.5 million, which translates to roughly $1,020. Broadly, Samsung is exploring a sticker price that puts it somewhere between the Galaxy S25 Plus and the top-end Ultra trim. 
Samsung’s Galaxy S25 Ultra is one of the most capable smartphone cameras out there, as long as your search is limited to the US shores. It’s a terrific performer, but the pace of camera innovation has somewhat slowed down, while the likes of Xiaomi 15 Ultra have truly lifted the game. Things might finally turn around for Samsung next year.
According to a fresh leak, Samsung is eyeing a handful of notable upgrades for the Galaxy S26 Ultra’s imaging hardware. Instead of a 10-megapixel short-range telephoto camera on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, its successor will reportedly shift to a larger 50-megapixel sensor.
Moreover, the optical zoom range might also get a lift, going from 3x to 3.5x zoom. Talking about zoom levels, the long-range periscope-style telephoto camera could also go from 5x to 8x optical zoom range, and a wider aperture to go with it. As usual, optical image stabilization will be available across the primary and zoom cameras.

The main camera on the Galaxy S26 Ultra is said to stick with a 200-megapixel unit, with an identical 1/1.3-inch sensor format and 0.6-micron pixel size. However, it could mark the return of an innovative aperture trick that Samsung introduced years ago.
Bringing back the variable aperture
Back in 2018, Samsung introduced the Galaxy S9 Plus with a novel camera trick. The main sensor on this one offered a variable aperture facility, allowing it to switch between f/1.5 and f/2.4 range. The Galaxy S26 Ultra could bring back the variable aperture system, and in a more capable fashion.
Samsung is preparing to launch another flagship model, the Galaxy S25 Edge. This slim phone was originally teased at the launch of the Galaxy S25 in January, with rumors pointing to an April 16 launch date for the new device.
So far we’ve seen a range of specs for the phone, but thanks to a reliable leaker, it looks like we’re closer to some of the details. According to UniverseIce, posting on Weibo, the Galaxy S25 Edge will come with a titanium alloy frame.
Samsung is expected to release its highly anticipated One UI 7 update worldwide starting the week of April 7. However, there has been some debate about the exact timing and locations of the rollout. A new development has added to the confusion regarding the specific release dates.
According to SamMobile, Samsung has quietly pulled the One UI 7 launch date in the U.S. from its news portal. Subsequently, it also changed the language on its Australia Newsroom portal and perhaps others. Instead, it says the official rollout “will start from April.” At least for now, exact dates remain for news portals for South Korea, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Malaysia, Singapore, Belgium, and the Netherlands.

GM and Ford reported big increases in the number of cars sold ahead of the Trump administration's 25% tariffs on imported vehicles.

        GM said that new vehicle sales had jumped nearly 17% compared to the first quarter of last year, while Ford reported a 19% increase in retail sales in March and a 5% increase overall for the quarter. It also reported a 94% increase in EV sales.
    

        Ford still saw total sales drop 1%, largely due to the discontinuation of two models last year.
    

        The two carmakers are among the most exposed to the 25% levy on imported vehicles that Trump announced would take effect Wednesday. Trump announced this last week after previously granting the auto industry a 30-day exemption from similar levies on Canada and Mexico.
    

        GM and Ford both build cars for the US market in factories in Mexico. GM's Blazer and Equinox EVs and Ford's Mustang Mach-E are manufactured in the country.
    

        Automakers and analysts have warned that Trump's auto tariffs will have a devastating impact on the industry, pushing up prices and potentially wiping out profits of the Detroit ""Big Three"" — GM, Ford, and Stellantis.
    

        Analysis from Anderson Economic Group estimated that the levies could raise prices of new cars by between $4,000 and $12,000 depending on the vehicle, with EVs hit especially hard.
    

        After Trump announced the auto tariffs, dealers and economists previously told BI that customers were ""rushing"" to buy cars before they came into effect.
    

        Ford and GM were not the only automakers to see a bump ahead of the tariffs. Hyundai said March had been its second-biggest month for sales ever, while Toyota said US sales of its hybrids and electric vehicles rose 44% last month.
    

        ""The last week, and including this past weekend, was by far the best weekend that I've seen in a very long time,"" Hyundai Motor North America CEO Randy Parker said on a media call Tuesday, multiple outlets reported.
    

        ""I've been doing this now for a very, very long time. So lots of people, I think, rushed in this weekend, especially, to try and beat the tariffs,"" he added.

If you’re looking for a great set of earbuds, the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are among our favorites. They are usually pretty expensive at $249.99, though. Deals pop up from time to time, though, and this is definitely one of the best ones we’ve seen. You can currently get the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro for just $139.99. That’s a $110 discount!
Get the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro for just $139.99 ($110 off)
This offer is available directly from Woot!, an Amazon-owned website that focuses on discounts. The sale is scheduled to end in six days, or “until sold out.” Also, there is a limit of one unit per customer. While the offer applies to both the Silver and White color versions, the Silver one is now out of stock, so you’ll have to settle with the White model.
We have actually seen Woot! offer the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro for $134.99 in the past, but that deal only came with a 90-day Woot! warranty. While you are paying $5 extra bucks with this sale, this one includes the full-year warranty from the manufacturer, in this case, Samsung. I happen to like the peace of mind.
Regardless, this is still a fantastic discount on the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. These earbuds are pretty outstanding, and they are especially nice if you happen to own a Samsung smartphone. If you do, you’ll get access to some really nice exclusive features, such as auto-switching between Galaxy devices, sound detection, and some really cool AI capabilities. These include live translation, which is pretty handy if you’re a traveler. The earbuds will also detect important noises, such as sirens, and turn off ANC so you can be alert.
As you can see, these exclusive features are more like added treats, as opposed to essential capabilities. This means you can still enjoy them with any other device. The sound quality is excellent, and ANC performance is also very good. Based on the testing from our experts at Sound Guys, these can block out 76% of all external noise.
We were very pleased with the battery life, too. You can get about 4.5 hours per earbud on a full charge. These also get an IP57 rating, so they’ll be great for using in light rain, or to wear at the gym without worrying about sweat getting to them. The design is also pretty nice and sleek.
There are no limitations in terms of interaction here. The stems support touch, swipe, and pressing gestures. This gives you quick access to most functions. Other features include 360 audio, Find My capabilities, and more.
One of our main complaints about the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro was the price, but this $139.99 price drop makes them a bit of a no-brainer. Go get yours before they are all gone! We can only assume these are flying off the shelves.

50,2025-04-02,"The FDA's refused to authorize sale of kid-friendly e-cigarettes.
A unanimous Supreme Court on Wednesday backed the Food and Drug Administration's refusal to authorize the sale of kid-friendly flavored e-cigarettes and vapes, including the flavors ""Killer Kustard Blueberry,"" ""Rainbow Road,"" and ""Pineapple Express.""
Justice Samuel Alito, in his opinion for the court, rejected the manufacturers' claims that the agency had acted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of federal law by changing the requirements for product approval in the middle of the process.
""In the end, we cannot say that the FDA improperly changed its position with respect to scientific evidence, comparative efficacy, or device type,"" Alito wrote. He returned the case to a lower court for further review.
The ruling effectively holds the line on the government's decision to severely limit the number of flavored tobacco products legally available in the U.S. market out of concerns over the impact on children.
Kid-friendly flavors, such as fruit, candy, mint, menthol and desserts -- which are largely not approved by the FDA and are currently sold on store shelves illegally -- have been fueling an explosion in retail sales of e-cigarettes.
While vaping among youth is declining, more than 1.6 million children use the products, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 90% of them consume illicit flavored brands.
""Today's ruling is a major victory for the health of America's kids and efforts to protect them from the flavored e-cigarettes that have fueled a youth nicotine addiction crisis,"" said Yolanda Richardson, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, an advocacy group. She noted the FDA has denied over 26 million flavored e-cigarette product applications so far.
""While the FDA has authorized the sale of only 34 e-cigarette products, manufacturers continue to flood the market with thousands of illegal, unauthorized products,"" Richardson said in a statement. ""To end this crisis, the FDA must deny marketing applications for flavored e-cigarettes and step up enforcement efforts to clear the market of illegal products. Today's ruling should spur the FDA to act quickly to do so.""
An attorney for the companies -- White Lion Investments LLC, operating at Triton Distribution, and Vapetasia LLC -- said in a statement they view flavored vapes as a safe and valuable alternative for smokers trying to quit.
""We are obviously disappointed in the outcome. Triton and Vapetasia continue to believe in the great harm reduction potential of their products for cigarette smokers. We look forward to further proceedings before the Fifth Circuit on the prejudicial error issue that the Supreme Court remanded,"" said Eric Heyer, the Thompson Hine partner who argued the case.
Since 2009, federal law requires sellers of new nicotine products to provide regulators with scientific evidence to show that the products would promote public health, but the statute does not spell out specifically what evidence is necessary and sufficient. The FDA's guidance on how to meet that requirement was at the center of the case.
While the first Trump administration had taken a hard line against the marketing and sale sweet and candy flavored vapes, President Donald Trump said during the campaign that he wants to ""save"" flavored vapes. It's not clear how the FDA, newly under his control, may modify regulations around flavored vapes or alter the approval process.
Despite their loss in the case, vape manufacturers are able to reapply for approval with the FDA in a new application and attempt to show how benefits of the product to public health would outweigh the dangers to teens.
""In light of the statutory text and the well-documented and serious risks flavored e-cigarette products pose to youth, it should have come as no surprise that applicants would need to submit rigorous scientific evidence showing that the benefits of their products would outweigh those risks,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor concluded in a short concurring opinion in the case.

52,2025-04-02,"Upgraded Ray-Ban Metas with a monocular display? Yes, please!

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Just when we think we might know everything about Meta's product release plans for this year, a new report throws a wrench into that idea. Bloomberg reports that Meta's Hypernova project is set to release this year under the Ray-Ban branding, sporting a display and an elevated price tag over current Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses.
Hypernova diverges from the existing Ray-Ban Meta glasses by offering a single display on the bottom of the right lens, a full set of Android-powered computational hardware, and a bundled gesture band that makes interaction with a small screen simple. I made a mockup above based on Bloomberg's description, which should give you an idea of what to expect.
But it's the sEMG band that might be the most exciting feature, as it means a proper smart device experience can be had without having to hold a smartphone all the time. It means apps can be interacted with without feeling clunky like they do on a smartwatch, and it means messages can not only be read but also easily responded to.
I previously covered how sEMG bands work, but the gist is that they can sense muscle movements in your hand and understand the difference between pinching your fingers together and scrolling with your thumb. The only thing that might get in the way is typing, but that's something Meta AI is already very capable of doing by using your voice.

The glasses are expected to be bundled with an sEMG band, which will make it dead easy to interact with apps despite the small screen.
This is a huge step in the right direction for Meta as the company has struggled to release smart glasses products early enough to satisfy investors, often seeming to focus on the big picture rather than delivering smaller stepping-stone products that will get consumers interested in the concept.
The company's second pair of connected Ray-Ban glasses have been a hit, with Meta ramping up production in hopes of selling as many as 10 million this year. The next obvious step is to offer a new pair with a single display that begins getting people used to looking forward at a display instead of craning their necks downward all the time.
As this display is situated in the bottom portion of the right lens, you'll have to gaze downward at least a little bit to get the clearest view. From my estimation, this is a much better design than Google Glass — the closest conceptual product I can think of — as Glass required you to look up to see the display. If I'm walking in a city and need to look at directions, I don't want to be looking away from the sidewalk.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android

Since these glasses are powered by Android, Bloomberg says there will be a handful of apps that ship with it but that it won't have a dedicated app store. Apps include Meta's messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Messenger, a camera app for using the upgraded cameras on the glasses, as well as a maps app for visual directions and navigation.
But while these glasses aren't prepared to replace your phone just yet, they are the gateway into augmenting the phone experience to get you less reliant on your little black mirror and more comfortable with using Meta AI and alternative forms of input. They'll still connect to your phone using the Meta View app that existing Ray-Ban Meta glasses use, but at least some of that connection won't be required now that these glasses will have onboard computing.
These new glasses would be powered by Android and be capable of running apps on the small screen in the right lens.
These glasses will not feature positional tracking like the Meta Orion prototype or the Meta Aria Gen 2 research glasses. Most likely, this is to help shave some of the cost off the price tag as well as provide reasonable battery life.
It's unreasonable to expect a fully-featured pair of smart glasses to somehow be light enough for comfort and have all-day battery life in this day and age, but that's a problem that might be solved a few years in the future.
Meta is also said to be upgrading the camera, something I'm particularly excited about since I use the Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses camera all the time. The analogy was that the current camera is roughly equivalent to an iPhone 11, while the new camera will be equivalent to an iPhone 13.
This is, essentially, the start of the future Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke about when he said Meta would lead the tech space into a post-smartphone era. These new Hypernova glasses are said to retail for between $1,000 and $1,400, so it'll still be a while before they're affordable enough to make a dent in the smartphone market.

Meta looks to be releasing several different shades this year, including a potential Oakley-branded pair known as Supernova 2 within Meta's R&D labs. These glasses will be more full-featured than Hypernova and are said to be optimized for athletic use, which makes sense given Oakley's popularity with bikers and in some other sports.
Bloomberg's report also details the existence of Hypernova 2, a follow-up to the glasses described above that would feature two displays — one in each lens. Meta is said to still be working on a fully standalone pair of smart glasses that don't rely on a connection to a phone, but those glasses — currently known as Artemis — are likely still two years away.
Meanwhile, Samsung's Project HAEAN smart glasses are said to be making a debut this year alongside the Project Moohan XR headset. HAEAN is said to look similar to Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses and is powered by Google Gemini, similar to the Google smart glasses you see in the image above.
HAEAN will likely be a direct competitor to the upcoming Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, as they reportedly feature a display in the lenses. Little else is known about HAEAN at this time.
Bloomberg also reported that Apple is working on a similar pair, ensuring that Meta will be feverishly working on market-ready products faster than ever to keep up with competition from the biggest tech brands.

by  Julia Lee
Even if you only own one copy of a game, you and your friends can all get in on the fun together using GameShare, which was shown as part of the April 2 Nintendo Switch 2 Direct.
This appears to run similarly to the “Download Play” option for the Nintendo DS. For example, one person may own a copy of Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain, but using the new GameShare option, your friends can jump in and join you to play, even if they don’t own it.
This feature will only work with select games, but the stream did show off a few confirmed titles — including Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker, Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics, Super Mario Odyssey, and the aforementioned Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain.
The stream also noted that there will be Nintendo Switch 2 games that use this feature, though none were announced yet.
The GameShare feature makes sense, as Nintendo recently also announced the ability to loan your buddies your games using Virtual Game Cards. In an era of shared Netflix passwords and Steam Family groups, Nintendo understands that not everyone can afford to buy every great title on the market — and that’s what I appreciates about them.

New tariffs are set to be announced today, after the close of the stock market. (Photo by Gregor ... More Fischer/Getty Images)
Key Takeaways
Stocks were mixed on Tuesday with the S&P 500 up 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.9% while both the Russell 2000 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were flat. Markets have been waiting on an announcement from President Donald Trump as to just what new tariffs imposed by the U.S. will look like. That announcement is expected Wednesday, after the close of trading. While the tariff news will be the most talked about story, there are also some other items worth noting and what they may be suggesting from a macro perspective.
Let’s begin though with tariffs. Not much is known at this point as to just what will and won’t be tariffed or the rates which will be applied. President Trump has kept his plans to himself but will announce them Wednesday at 3 p.m. CT. While equity markets will be closed, index futures trade until 4 p.m. CT and then reopen at 5 p.m. CT. I think those will give us the first glimpse of how markets interpret whatever is announced.
On Tuesday, the most recent Institute of Supply Management Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index was released. That index came in at 49, below estimates of 49.5. While this isn't a headline grabbing number like Friday's employment report, I bring it up because it is one of those numbers you hear about when it breaks a certain threshold, which is what it did by falling below 50. Generally speaking, when this number is above 50, it means the economy is expanding. When it falls below 50, it suggests a contracting economy and is a possible recession indicator.
Related to the ISM PMI number is what we're seeing with the benchmark 10-year note and its yield. After hitting a high of 4.81% in January, rates have been steadily declining. Currently, yields on the 10-year are down to 4.14%. As recently as just a couple months ago, elevated yields were being talked about as a sign of inflation. Now, the narrative has switched. Falling rates aren't being attributed to inflation coming under control, but rather, as a sign of a weakening economic outlook.
The ISM PMI and fall in rates are just two data points and I don't want to jump to any conclusions about the future of the economy. At the same time, in addition to Friday's jobs report, we have a fair amount of economic data this week, much of which isn't something we might normally pay attention to. However, when investors begin getting nervous, they latch on to economic data they might otherwise ignore.
Tied into the economic data are gold and oil prices. Gold, often seen as a safe haven, is trading above $3,160 in premarket. Since its low of $1,831 back in October 2023, gold has been on a tear and is up 20% this year. Until recently, oil prices were trading in the mid-$60s. Prices have jumped above $70 recently, but I don't think that is a result of demand. Instead, I think it's a result of tariffs. President Trump announced a 25% tariff on all goods from any country doing business in the U.S. that also imports oil from Venezuela. Therefore, even at $70, I believe oil is suggesting a weakened economic outlook.
Turning to individual stocks, according to The Wall Street Journal, Visa is offering Apple $100 million to take over its credit card business. Goldman Sachs was the original issuer of the Apple Card, which is supported by the MasterCard network. Since Goldman announced plans to leave the consumer lending sector, a bidding war has been going on for Apple's business with American Express, Chase and MasterCard all making offers.
Tesla is scheduled to announce first quarter sales on Wednesday. As Elon Musk has become more of a political figure, shares of Tesla have come under a lot of selling pressure. For the year, shares are down 34%. At the same time, Tesla dealerships and cars have been protested against and vandalized. Musk’s association with the Trump administration has had the effect of making the Tesla brand an extension of a political ideology. Therefore, it will be interesting to hear its sales numbers and outlook.
For today, obviously the big story will be after the close. We often see directional moves ahead of big news and then as the release nears, markets move back toward being unchanged. Therefore, I would not be at all surprised if we see a big move intraday that reverses itself. I'm not necessarily expecting any panic at this point. While the VIX is at 23.54 in premarket, thus far, all the selling we have seen has been orderly. VIX briefly touched 30 at one point this year, which is a number where things can get panicky, but it quickly pulled back from that level. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if we see an increase in volatility during the day, then a contraction overnight. While most agree tariffs are bad for an economy, there may be a sense of certainty after the announcement, allowing VIX to contract. As always, I would stick with your investing plan and long-term objectives.

Doth mine eyes deceive me? The cheapest and, in many ways, most desirable of Nvidia’s new RTX 50-series graphics cards is actually available to buy at a major retailer? And I don’t have to give up my soul or any other precious bits? Indeed, for the last 90 minutes I’ve had the option to buy an RTX 5070 from Best Buy. At the $550 MSRP. Holy crap.
Update: I kept an eye on the Best Buy page all Wednesday, and the $550 card remained available until I went to bed. Alas, as of Thursday afternoon, April 3rd, it’s showing as unavailable nearby with no shipping option. The original story follows. 
So most mornings I scope out some deals that will appeal to PCWorld readers. It’s part of my job. This morning I saw an Nvidia PNY RTX 5070 graphics card on SlickDeals, which Best Buy is allegedly selling for $549.99. Normally that wouldn’t be anything interesting, but as you’re probably aware, new Nvidia cards have been almost impossible to find for a month and change. Doubly so if you’re looking for one without a ridiculous markup from an add-in board partner, a retailer trying to make a little bank, a reseller-slash-scalper, or some combination of all three. 
So following the link, I was surprised to see the $550 graphics card still available to buy, yes, at the price Nvidia advertised way back at launch. I was able to add it to my cart. I was able to begin the checkout process, with an extra account verification step and a countdown timer that usually doesn’t apply to Best Buy’s straightforward sales. I was presented with the “place order” button, indicating that it was about to charge my card. 
90 minutes later, I was able to do it again. Shipping to my Pennsylvania home in two days. To use technical industry parlance: hot diggity. 
A couple of qualifiers here. One, I have a Best Buy Plus membership, basically the store’s version of Amazon Prime. It’s possible that Best Buy is reserving a certain amount of stock specifically for these memberships — the company has done so before. 
It’s also possible that, had I actually checked out at either of these points, Best Buy would decide that it doesn’t actually have the stock after all, apologize in an email, and reverse the charge in a day or two. We’ve seen that happen with the latest graphics cards as well. 
But even with those sobering afterthoughts, the fact that I was able to get this far into the process for what’s probably one of the most in-demand graphics cards on the market right now is promising. It means that somewhere, in at least some measurable degree, availability is improving. We can but hope. Give it a shot if you’ve been looking for a relatively affordable card. And don’t you dare try to flip it, or Santa will be going to the reindeer stalls to fill up your stocking this year.

Buying a home has gotten a lot more difficult since the pandemic.

        With home prices surging around the country since 2020, the average household income needed to purchase a home at the median national price has risen by 49.5%, according to a new report from Bankrate.
    

        About two-thirds of states have seen a surge in required income more than 50%. Utah comes in on top with an 89% increase in the last five years, the report said.
    

        But on an absolute basis, some required household incomes to buy the average home are still fairly reasonable, well below the US average of $116,986 — which buys a $418,489 home.
    

        Still, given the nationwide rise in the required income to buy a home, the report listed a few tips for breaking into the market, like improving your credit score to secure a lower mortgage rate; finding out about down-payment assistance programs; looking at cheaper options like condos; and simply waiting until you're in a better financial position.
    

        Below are the 10 states with the lowest household incomes needed to buy the state's median-priced home, ranked in descending order, according to the Bankrate study. The increase in income required since 2020 is also included, as is the median home price and its monthly mortgage payment.

President Donald Trump is known for the art of the deal. However, his childhood home in Queens sold at a $1.2 million loss last month.

        While Trump had nothing to do with the sale of the Jamaica Estates home, where he lived until he was 4 years old, it sold for just $835,000 after selling for $2.1 million in 2017.
    

        New York City records show the 2,500-square-foot home, located 22 miles from Manhattan, was sold to a New York-based LLC named 1388 Group. The home sold in an off-market deal, and the seller ""just needed the money,"" according to the New York Post.
    

        Unlike the previous two sales in 2016 and 2017, this sale went under the radar — those sales were auctions with major national media attention. Misha Haghani, the CEO and founder of Paramount Realty, the auction firm that handled the first two sales, said he'd never seen anything like it.
    

        ""I don't think there has ever been an auction on the planet for a property that was more high-profile — I'm pretty sure of that,"" Haghani told Business Insider.
    

        ""He was running to be the 45th president of the United States,"" he added. ""Before that, there were only 44 US presidents. How many of their childhood homes do you think still stood?""
    

        Initially, an in-person auction was planned for the day of the final presidential debate in 2016, but there was so much attention that it had to be postponed.
    

        Haghani believes the commotion surrounding the first sale increased the home's value — he thought it was worth about $950,000 at the time.
    

        Haghani said the seller still received a bid and wanted to accept, so they sold the home for $1.39 million in December 2016.
    

        In January 2017, the house was up for auction again — this time, a sealed bid auction, where hopefuls submit a bid blindly by a certain deadline. The second sale raised the value another 50% as the home sold for $2.14 million.
    

        Haghani said he ""was surprised"" by the numbers. 
    

        However, the more recent sales price wasn't surprising, as the home had recently fallen into disrepair. In October, the real estate website Curbed reported that 20 to 30 feral cats commandeered the now-abandoned property.
    

        Trump's father, a real-estate developer, built the five-bedroom home and the neighborhood itself. According to Realtor.com, the median listing price for a home in the neighborhood today is $1.5 million.

Americans' credit card debt is at an all-time high. Soaring interest rates on credit cards coupled with other economic factors could make the situation worse.

        In March, Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Anna Paulina Luna introduced a bipartisan House bill that aims to cap annual credit card interest rates at 10% a year.
    

        ""Credit cards with high interest rates regularly trap working people in endless cycles of debt,"" Ocasio-Cortez said in a press statement. ""At a time when families are struggling to make ends meet, we cannot allow big banks to shake down our communities for profit.""
    

        The average annual percentage rate on credit balances has nearly doubled in the past decade to 21% in 2024 from 12% in 2003, per the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Credit card interest rates can fluctuate with an individual's credit score, but they are ultimately determined by market conditions.
    

        As credit card interest rates have risen, so has the amount of consumer debt, as well as delinquencies on payments.
    

        The total amount of credit card debt has ballooned to $1.2 trillion in Q4 of 2024 up from $720 billion in the same quarter of 2004, per the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. More people are falling behind on their monthly payments and the number of active credit card users only making the minimum payment on their monthly credit card statement has reached a record high, ""showing signs of consumer stress,"" per the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's 2024 Q3 report.
    

        President Donald Trump ran on campaign promises last year that he would temporarily cap credit card interest rates at 10%, to allow Americans to ""catch up"" on their balances, but he hasn't taken executive action or spoken about interest rate caps since entering office.
    

        The bill is now referred to the House Committee on Financial Services, but has yet to be put on the calendar for a vote in the House of Representatives.
    

        Ocasio-Cortez and Luna did not respond to requests for comment.

President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs are here, and they could mean increased prices on a variety of goods Americans rely on.

        On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order announcing a 10% baseline tariff on all countries, set to go into effect on Saturday, as well as a reciprocal-tariff strategy. The announcement sent global markets plummeting.
    

        Trump said countries would be charged ""approximately half"" of what they have been charging the US. (Tariffs are taxes that US importers pay, not ones individual countries pay.) The tariffs apply to nations with which the US has the highest trade deficits and take effect next week on Wednesday.
    

        The reciprocal tariff on goods from China is 34%. That's on top of the existing 20% tariff on Chinese goods, meaning the total effective tariff rate on Chinese goods now stands at 54%.
    

        The announcement sets a 49% tariff for Cambodia, 46% for Vietnam, and 44% for Sri Lanka. The reciprocal goods tariff is 32% for Taiwan and 26% for India.
    

        The European Union has been hit with a 20% tariff.
    

        Trump also announced a 25% tariff on all car imports into the US.
    

        He did not mention any new tariffs on Canada or Mexico during his remarks.
    

        ""April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,"" Trump said.
    

        He said of his motivation for the reciprocal tariffs: ""They do it to us, and we do it to them — very simple. Can't get any simpler than that.""
    

        In the weeks leading up to Wednesday, Trump signaled various tariffs he was planning to implement. They included a 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico, a 25% tariff on all car and car part imports into the US, tariffs on agricultural goods, and reciprocal tariffs on all countries that have placed tariffs on US goods. A 25% levy on steel and aluminum imports is already in effect.
    

        These tariffs are likely to increase the prices of affected goods. While some companies might choose to absorb some of the costs, consumers are set to shoulder most of the burden.
    

        Markets and consumers have already been feeling financial strains due to the uncertainty with Trump's trade plans.
    

        The US is likely to face retaliatory tariffs following Trump's announcement.
    

        The leaders of multiple countries, including Canada and China, vowed they would be taking countermeasures but did not immediately provide details.
    

        In a video address on Thursday, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said that tariffs ""make things work worse, not better,"" and that the EU was ready to take ""firm countermeasures if necessary."" She added: ""Our immediate response to tariffs is unity and determination.""
    

        The United Auto Workers union previously praised the president's plan to place a 25% tariff on all cars and car parts imported into the US, saying it would bring more jobs back into the US auto industry.
    

        ""These tariffs are a major step in the right direction for autoworkers and blue-collar communities across the country,"" UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement.
    

Correction: April 3, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated the reciprocal tariff rate on China. It is 34%, not 32%.

Select a question above or ask something else
President Trump's proposed tariffs, which include a significant 25% tariff on imported cars and reciprocal tariffs affecting many countries, could indirectly impact the U.S. travel industry by making the country a more expensive destination. This includes potential cost increases in the hotel sector for construction and equipment and disruptions in airline operations due to supply chain concerns. Despite mixed signals in consumer confidence, top-earning households continue to drive U.S. travel spending, though luxury spending may be affected by stock market fluctuations.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday laid out a sweeping set of tariffs that would hit products from a long list of countries. 
Among the proposed tariffs: A baseline of 10% for trading partners; 25% on all imported cars; and reciprocal tariffs on at least 50 countries that can reach nearly 50%. 
The plans go further than many were expecting. Reciprocal tariffs aren't based solely on rates from other countries: ""We will calculate the combined rates of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers, and other forms of cheating,” Trump said at a White House Rose Garden event.   
For the travel industry, the impact is indirect. Tariffs apply to imported products — think cars, washing machines, and even champagne. They don’t get added to airfares, hotel rooms, or tours.
But the knock-on effects could be significant. Tariffs can lead to higher prices making America a more expensive destination for visitors. And then there are the vibes. Will tourists still be eager to visit a U.S. that is engaged in a trade war with their home country?
""Trump policies might cut U.S. travel growth by half,"" said Seth Borko, head of Skift Research, referring to a range of actions like a possible tariff war and increased uncertainty about how border agents will interpret and enforce border rules.
Stocks were falling sharply in the hours after Trump's announcement. 
Hoteliers face two potential areas of added expense: costs for new construction, and costs for furniture, fixtures, and equipment. 
Tariffs on construction materials such as steel may eventually push prices up, as Skift Research noted in the report, U.S. Hotel Supply Outlook: How Slowing Growth Is Shaping the 2025 Market.
""If tariffs lead to rising costs, developers may once again face financial hurdles that could slow project timelines,"" wrote Pranavi Agarwal, senior research analyst. 
Hoteliers may also face rising costs for furniture, fixtures, and equipment.
Among extended-stay hotel operators, there is cautious optimism. Reshoring manufacturing to the U.S. could benefit the extended-stay segment due to increased demand for temporary housing for workers near new projects.
Tariffs have started to impact U.S.-Canada travel. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby said at an investor conference in March that the carrier had seen a “big drop” in Canadian traffic to the U.S. 
Boeing chief financial officer Brian West said the company isn’t expecting to see a “material near-term impact” from tariffs. The U.S. plane maker has a massive backlog in orders, which West said would shield the company in the short-term. However, he added that there was some concern that tariffs could have an impact on the availability of parts. 
Airbus could prioritize deliveries to non-U.S. customers as a result of the tariffs, the plane maker’s CEO said in February, according to Reuters. “We have a large demand from the rest of the world, so [if] we face very significant difficulties to deliver to the U.S., we can also adapt by bringing forward deliveries to other customers which are very eager to get planes,” Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said. 
Speaking to Skift last week, Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary, highlighted the level of uncertainty: ""There’s lots of unintended consequences built in around what Trump is doing. We honestly don’t know if it will be net-positive or net-negative — we’ll just have to wait and see.” 
The Dublin-based company is one of Boeing’s largest airline customers, with hundreds of new planes on order.
Tariffs are one thing, but heated rhetoric around trade wars can lead to heightened patriotism and reduce the willingness to travel to the U.S.. Canadian visits, for example, have already begun to decline, early data suggests.
Porter Airlines president Kevin Jackson told Skift that the Canadian carrier decided to pause marketing for U.S. destinations. The airline is the third largest in Canada. 
“Canadian consumers have made it clear to us that they don't believe that we should be promoting travel to the United States,” Jackson said. 
Accor CEO Sébastien Bazin said Tuesday that there was “bad buzz” around travel to the U.S. and that summer bookings from Europeans were down 25%. 
Virgin Atlantic’s CFO recently warned of slowing U.S. demand.
Measures of consumer confidence have plummeted but the impact on travel spending is mixed. A survey by the Conference Board showed that despite a “gloomy” outlook, households planned to increase their travel spending.
But Bank of America said this week that spending on lodging services and tourism-related services was about 2.5% below last year's levels, while spending on air travel was down around 6%.
According to Skift Research, the top 9% of households account for 30% of U.S. travel spending. The top 15% account for 40%. 
A so-called “wealth effect” can account for some of that – a soaring stock market and rising home values has increased net worth for many households and encourages more spending, including on travel.
The prospect of rising tariffs has been a drag on stocks, however, with the S&P 500 at points down 10% from highs. Stocks were falling following Trump's remarks Wednesday. Continued declines in asset values could lead to a pullback in spending from luxury travelers.

69,2025-04-02,"Update: As of April 4, Nintendo said it was pushing the Switch 2 preorder date for U.S.-based customers. The company did not offer any more specifics when players could expect to put down preorders, though the launch date is still set for June 5. In a post to Twitter, GameStop said it would be working “closely with Nintendo” to provide more updates on how those customers could order Nintendo’s new handheld
Original Story Continues Below:
Nintendo Switch 2 is now here, and yes, you can soon buy itâor at least as long as the stock holds. The Switch 2 is set to launch June 5 for $450. Preorders are set to start June 9 for the base console and a $500 bundle with the launch title Mario Kart World. Before you scream âShut up and take my money,â just be aware you should try to avoid scalpers as much as possible, especially as Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa has claimed it should have enough Switch 2s at launch for everyone.
See Nintendo Switch 2 at Best Buy
We suggest you sign in to your accounts, whether on Amazon, Walmart, or Best Buy and have your credit card information already saved to get the fastest checkout. Most shops will be selling Switch 2s on a first-come, first-served basis, and if this is your first rodeo, it’s best to be prepared to avoid disappointment. Just don’t get confused by any listings for “Nintendo Switch Version 2,” as those are just an updated version of the original Switch.
For U.S.-based customers, the Switch 2 should be available to preorder on Nintendoâs online store. For now, Nintendo has a dedicated page where you can “register your interest” in a Switch 2. You need to log in with your Nintendo Account, but once you select your preferred console the company issues a notice reading “Eligible Nintendo Account holders will receive an email when it’s time to purchase.” These invitations will start hitting customers’ inboxes on May 8. You’ll have just 72 hours to confirm your system and you should get your Switch 2 order close to release day June 5. Nintendo normally lists a store locator on its pages to see which local shops have in-person stock, but we likely wonât see that up and running until June.
Nintendo is prioritizing Switch Online members who have been signed up for at least 12 months and have at least 50 hours played in games through that account. If you suspect you donât meet the minimum, you may be better off looking at third parties.
Best Buy also confirmed with Gizmodo that preorders will begin April 9 and stores will be open for a midnight launch June 5.
As for outside retailers, GameStop already has its Switch 2 page available for U.S.-based customers, with a space to put in an email to get updates once preorders go live. Walmart has its preorder page up. Best Buy has a livestream page dedicated to the Switch 2. The site is also hosting a deal for Best Buy Plus or Total members to get a $20 gift card for every $150 spent on Nintendo products (a Plus membership costs $50-per-year but Total will set you back a whopping $180). We expect other sites to add their own preorder pages soon, and we’ll update this post to list them once they become available.
For GameStop, the company is offering up to $175 trade-in towards Switch 2 reservations, though you’ll only get that higher price if you hand in a $350 Switch OLED. A Switch Lite will only scratch off $100 of that original price. Also be aware you may want to make sure you’ll be able to transfer your Switch 1 library to the new console.
For others in North America, Walmart Canada already has a page offering preorder information for the Switch 2.
If you’re looking for the best, fastest deal posters, we suggest you log into Bluesky and find Wario64, or if for some reason you’re still on Twitter, find Cheap Ass Gamer. With big tech releases, it often matters how quick on the draw you are to hit the preorder button before somebody else, but we stress that you shouldn’t make it your life’s mission to get a Switch 2 on launch day. There’s still time between then and now, and anything can happen. It’s always better to wait for hands-on reports and reviews before you take the plunge on big expenses.
This post was updated 4/3/25 at 8:52 a.m. ET to include stock info for Walmart.

 Contributor. 
Today, Montecito remains one of the most resilient luxury housing markets in the United States.
Tucked between the Santa Ynez Mountains and the Pacific Ocean, Montecito on California’s coast offers a rare combination: natural beauty, privacy and enduring appeal to high-net-worth buyers. It’s where British royalty and Hollywood titans trade the rush of city life for ocean breezes and palatial estates.
Nature defines the Montecito experience. Hiking trails wind through the foothills. White-sand beaches are minutes from nearly every doorstep. Mature landscaping and quiet streets reinforce the town’s idyllic, small-scale feel—even if the names on local property deeds read like a who's-who of the entertainment world.
From private beach clubs to wineries, year-round hiking to exclusive golf courses, Montecito delivers a lifestyle that few places can match.
Here, strict zoning laws limit overdevelopment, preserving the area's semi-rural charm and exclusivity. With fewer than 9,000 residents, Montecito has long attracted global elites and A-listers. Oprah Winfrey, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Jennifer Aniston, Ellen DeGeneres and Portia De Rossi, are just a few who have called it home.
“People who can choose to live anywhere in the world choose to live here,” says Dina Landi of Village Properties.
According to Billy Goldstein of Village Properties, Montecito logged 163 home sales in 2024—identical to 2023—but with a median sale price rising to US $5.4 million, up 4% year-on-year. The increase was largely fueled by strong second- and third-quarter activity, notes Goldstein.
A limited supply of sprawling estates overlooking the ocean and a reputation for discretion have crowned Montecito as a top-tier hideaway for UHNW buyers.
The fourth quarter of 2024 brought a brief slowdown, as buyers paused ahead of the U.S. election. But since then, pent-up demand has reignited the market.
January alone saw more than 25 homes change hands in 2025, marking a 20% increase from the previous year. Among them, four transactions exceeded the $20 million mark. By comparison, January 2024 saw just 12 closings, none surpassing the $10 million threshold.
Zooming out, the long-term trajectory tells a more compelling story: Montecito’s median price has climbed 76% since 2019, the last full pre-pandemic year.
With median home values soaring to $5.8 million, Montecito stands as one of the world’s most exclusive markets.
Looking ahead, this year is shaping up to be more balanced. Inventory is slowly rising, giving buyers more time and choice. The numbers on Redfin back it up: homes now spend a median of 65 days on the market, up from 53 days the year prior.
If there’s one clear shift in buyer preferences post-pandemic, it’s the desire for ease. Gone are the days when people want to undergo gut renovations only to experience rising construction costs and long lead times.
Stringent zoning restrictions curb unchecked growth, inspiring many Montecito residences to undergo tasteful revamps.
“There’s a premium for instant gratification,” says Jasmine Tennis of Riskin Partners Estate Group. “Buyers want to show up with their toothbrush and start enjoying weekends in Montecito.” Robert Riskin of Riskin Partners adds that building costs could rise even further as wildfire-related rebuilding efforts ramp up in nearby Los Angeles—only intensifying the appeal of turnkey inventory.
Supply, however, hasn’t kept pace with that demand.
Montecito is, at its heart, an elevated beach town.

Consider a recent example: as DeGeneres and de Rossi make their move to the United Kingdom, one property remained in their notable Montecito real estate portfolio—a 1,700-square-foot cottage on Hill Road. The couple purchased the home for $2.9 million in 2020 and returned it to the market in December 2024 at $4.99 million. Within 48 hours, it received multiple offers and ultimately closed 4% over asking. More than a dozen additional inquiries came in after the sale.
The secret? “Fresh staging. Competitive pricing,” says Landi. “Well-presented homes that reflect current buyer tastes are moving quickly.” And some celebrity pedigree, perhaps.
If Los Angeles is known for sleek, modernist mansions, Montecito leans in the opposite direction. Spanish Colonial Revival estates, ranch-style retreats and historic cottages reflect the town’s character.
Spanish Colonial Revival estates—long the hallmark of Santa Barbara County’s aesthetic—remains a cherished architectural favorite.
“Montecito is, at its heart, an elevated beach town,” says Tennis. “If a home reads too fussy or precious, there’s a disconnect. Buyers gravitate toward a casual yet sophisticated coastal feel.”
Expansive gardens and indoor-outdoor living are hallmarks of the area’s most desirable homes. Single-level estates, or those with primary suites on the main floor, remain especially popular among the town’s older, affluent buyer base.
Countless Montecito homes embrace simplicity over ornamentation, opting for designs that showcase the region’s breathtaking coastal panoramas.
Even in a town that spans just eight square miles, location matters. Properties near the Upper and Lower Villages command a premium for their walkability to top-tier amenities like Clark’s Oyster Bar, the incoming Nobu at the freshly renovated Four Seasons Resort The Biltmore Santa Barbara, and the members-only Montecito Club. The newly opened luxury outdoor retail center, The Post, adds another layer of cachet with its mix of specialty shops and curated offerings, where even Prada might feel pedestrian.
“You’re never more than 10 minutes from the beach, the mountains, or an incredible meal,” Tennis says. Locals quip that if anything takes longer than 10 minutes to reach, you won’t do it.
And perhaps its greatest asset? As Landi puts it: “You’re likely to add five to ten years to your life. That’s a selling point you can’t put a price on.”

    Commentary: Nintendo's next console already has a lot of great games in its future.
  
Wednesday saw the official reveal of the Switch 2. Nintendo announced that its next console will be released on June 5 and have a starting price of $450. In its hour-long Nintendo Direct, a lot of games were shown and I can safely say I'm excited. 
The Switch 2 looks like it'll have a lot of support from third-party developers to go along with Nintendo's spectacular first-party games. This means the new Switch will hit the ground running as its launch lineup already looks good, but there'll be even more must-buy games soon after.
These are a few of the games I'm most excited about.
Arguably, the biggest surprise of Wednesday's show was The Duskbloods from popular developer FromSoftware. The studio behind Dark Souls and Elden Ring is making an exclusive game for the Switch 2, and it looks remarkably like its last exclusive game, Bloodborne. There are still many questions about it, but this will easily be the most anticipated game of 2026. 
Hollow Knight, from developer Team Cherry, was a cult hit when it came out in 2017. Back in 2019, the developer revealed it was doing a sequel called Hollow Knight: Silksong that would focus on Hornet, a rival turned ally of the Knight who was the hero of the first game. Only a few seconds were shown during the stream, but this clip excited fans as it was confirmation that the game exists after years of silence from the developer. 
If there's one series that's a must-buy on any Nintendo console, it's Mario Kart. With the new game, Mario Kart World, the kart racing game goes to an open-world style, letting players travel anywhere. It looks so much fun, and I'm looking to buy the $500 Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle when the console launches. (The game will be an eye-watering $80 sold separately.)
One of the franchises that Nintendo seemed to have forgotten about was Donkey Kong, so I was happy to see it come back on the Switch 2. Donkey Kong Bananza is a new 3D platforming game featuring the Nintendo mascot, and it looks like a fresh new approach for the barrel-chucking simian. Nintendo did give a release date of July 17 for Donkey Kong's new game, and I can't wait. 
FromSoftware had a double whammy of games during the Switch 2 Direct. This is a port of Elden Ring, but the Tarnished Edition includes the original game as well as the DLC, Shadows of the Erdtree. 
Cyberpunk 2077 is an amazing game and having that playable on a handheld console will be a sight to see. It took multiple patches to get it running smoothly on the Steam Deck, but if it can run well right out of the box on the Switch 2, it will be a game to pick up. 
This was another surprise from the Nintendo Direct stream. IO Interactive is developing a new James Bond game, but not much other than the working title has been revealed. Still, with a studio like IO Interactive -- best known for the Hitman games -- working on it, it's easy to be excited for another Bond game. 
Here are some of the other games shown on Wednesday that I'm excited for: 
The Switch 2 launches on June 5, and preorders will be available at retailers starting on April 9. To prevent scalpers from buying most of the Switch 2 stock, Nintendo implemented some cunning requirements for those who want to buy a Switch 2 at launch."

At 15 and younger, members of Generation Alpha are too young to drive, likely have little purchasing power on their own, and most should have a relatively simple personal beauty routine. But a new study from Razorfish found that as they grow into teenagers, this youngest generation is increasingly interested in luxury items, influences family purchases and is very interested in personal care.
Top-shelf brands are big for this generation so far. Nearly seven in 10 own a luxury product by the time they are 10, and 35% aspire to own a luxury car when they are older. Three-quarters say they deserve to get more of the things they want, and 47% say they would like to receive a cash gift.
But their looks are also becoming increasingly important. One in three own more than three beauty products for a daily regimen, and three-quarters are interested in beauty content on social media. Just over half say they only know a little about beauty ingredients, but 72% want to teach their friends their skincare routines, and 73% want to teach their skincare routines to their parents. (This isn’t just girls: 45% of Gen Alpha boys are also interested in skincare, and 25% of them have a skincare routine of at least three products.) About two in five actually make their own beauty content, like “Get Ready With Me”-style videos, and 63% want to go to a party or event at a beauty store like Sephora.
And Gen Alpha already touts their outsized purchase power. While they might not have much money of their own to spend, the kids Razorfish surveyed say they take an active role in their family’s spending. More than three out of four say they are interested in helping to choose the food their family eats, and 61% say they have a big influence on what’s in their home kitchen and pantry. The same amount say they had final say on which car their family purchased.
While most older kids and adolescents start paying more attention to brands, cars and makeup, Generation Alpha has its own take on these areas. It’s more about brands and labels—and the adults in their lives are willing to give them more autonomy to make these decisions. Marketing to them as decision-makers is key. Brands should also highlight the luxurious aspects of their products to attract this generation of consumers, and could do well with making them fun to use. But as they grow and their perspectives change—and become more active participants in the economy—it will be interesting to see if the more materialistic aspects of their preferences make way for practicality.
Both Generation Alpha and their parents are key demographics for messaging. Jed Baker, founder and CEO of Starglow Media and Forbes 2021 30 Under 30 alumnus, has found an effective way to talk to them: Kid-targeted podcasts. I talked to Baker about podcasts and ways to effectively message the entire family. An excerpt from our interview is later in this newsletter.

The social media platform formerly known as Twitter has been acquired again, but this ownership change—at least on its face—won’t result in changes that are too dramatic. Last Friday, X owner Elon Musk announced the platform had been acquired for $33 billion by xAI, the AI company Musk owns. In announcing the deal, Musk said it values xAI at $80 billion and X at $33 billion—or $45 billion if its $12 billion in debt is included.
So what does this mean? The platform is still in Elon Musk’s hands, but it is a boon for X investors, especially since the social network has struggled since Musk bought it for $44 billion and took it private in 2022, writes Forbes’ John Hyatt. D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Hyatt “Musk is opportunistically using the very high valuation he has for his xAI business in order to make his investors in Twitter whole.” Musk, who was already the world’s richest person, also personally benefits from the merger as the value of his stake in the combined company increases, bringing his net worth to $374 billion.
Anchors at Newsmax's booth during the 2024 Republican National Convention.
With its IPO this week, Newsmax is the newest media giant. The right-wing media company debuted on the stock market with shares trading at $10. By the end of the day Monday, they’d surged more than 700%, forcing trading to stop 12 times because of volatility. On Tuesday, the stock saw its shares skyrocket another 180%. It ended the day with a market cap of just below $30 billion, surpassing the $23.4 billion value of Fox Corp.
Given the hard-right bent of Newsmax’s coverage, this gangbusters IPO may be fueled by the same sort of conservative vigor that drove stocks for Trump Media & Technology Group, parent company of President Donald Trump’s Truth Social network, to soar and then crash soon after it went public through a blank check company last March. As markets opened Wednesday, Newsmax’s shares were on their way down, dropping more than 45% by late morning.
An AI-generated Facebook profile picture in the style of Studio Ghibli animation.
OpenAI launched a Studio Ghibli-inspired filter with its new image generator, which has flooded social media with images redone in the classic Japanese animation style—and angered many Studio Ghibli fans, writes Forbes senior contributor Dani DiPlacido. While the stylized images show the drama and detail of Ghibli’s “house style,” popularized by its films Spirited Away and Kiki’s Delivery Service, they’ve also been a lightning rod for controversy. Studio Ghibli co-founder Hayao Miyazaki famously said that AI animation “is an insult to life itself” and requested this technology never be incorporated into his work. Forbes senior contributor Rob Salkowitz writes that AI-generated pictures have already elicited strong criticism from artists and other professionals for their unsettling images and odd inconsistencies. Considering that Miyazaki was so stringently opposed to AI art, Salkowitz writes this filter “is basically spitting in the face of a global icon whose work has brought joy to millions, but not only that. It’s a way for the AI tech lords to show all the aggrieved dissidents who’s boss, as we do these days.”
Starglow Media Founder and CEO Jed Baker.
Today’s media ecosystem calls for different playbooks, and 2021 Forbes 30 Under 30 alumnus Jed Baker has found one in podcasts for kids. Baker is CEO and founder of Starglow Media, the world’s top podcast network for kids and families. Starglow gets around 10 million monthly listens, but also attracts a coveted demographic: Families who listen together. I talked to Baker about Starglow’s success and ways to effectively message both parents and kids. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. 
Tell me about the kinds of ads and advertisers that work the best on Starglow. 
Baker: Almost all of our market is brands that have never advertised on audio before because there was never anyone with enough scale to do this. Over the last year, we had a 90% brand renewal rate. The average podcast brand renewal rate is like 33%. The conversion really has been working.
To the point of TV versus audio, we talk about the nag factor, and that was initially something that really got going on Saturday morning cartoons in the early ‘80s, when cable was on the rise. Part of that was because parents and kids were watching television together, and that doesn’t really exist anymore. TV viewership, whether it’s OTT, fast, YouTube, actual linear streaming, it’s so fragmented. The one common thing is that kids and parents aren’t necessarily watching together. The TV isn’t the common hearthstone of the family anymore. A lot of these brands spend an enormous amount of money trying to directly reach children, but they’re not getting the parent as well.
That’s where audio has now become the shared experience. It’s replaced what television used to be. Kids and parents listen to these podcasts together, during drives to the grocery store and from school, at breakfast, at bedtime, after school. It’s always a shared experience.
But to go beyond that, the ability to do host-read ads is incredibly impactful. Right now, if we have a podcast that families love and it’s a part of their daily routine, this podcast host becomes a trusted member of their lives. And so when they go on their show and talk to the families about a product or service that they are loving, it’s more of a familiar recommendation. In television, you don’t have Dora the Explorer telling kids and parents about this new [cleaning] product that she’s loving. It’s a very different form of messaging, frankly.
If you can get your message into a family’s daily routine, that is incredibly impactful as well.
The other thing is this is a really specific audience. In TV, no matter what, you’re going to find general entertainment. You might reach 50% of your target demo, but there’s a lot of wasted impressions. Our families are all in a very specific demographic. We have shows that cater to different age groups, so a brand knows which age they’re going to be talking to, and there are no wasted impressions.
Lastly, [television is] a lot less active of a viewership experience. Parents and kids will listen to these podcasts really intently, and especially when they’re in the car together, there are no distractions. It’s not like you’re doing a million things. They are really paying attention to the episode. They talk about the episodes afterwards. And because you’re removing these distractions, you truly get a one-on-one moment with this audience, as opposed to just white noise from the television.
How is it different to do a podcast ad for this audience than a more general audience that’s mostly adults?
Families respond well to certain products. Our families have two times the purchasing power of most adults, so when there’s a product that really aligns well with our audience, they have no problem buying.
Going beyond that, the biggest thing here is that if you’re advertising to adults, you’re advertising to one person. When you’re advertising to kids and parents, yes, you’re advertising to the parent, but you’re also advertising to that kid who’s going to continually pester that parent. [About] 87% of parents say that their children have a major impact on the brand they decides to purchase—especially in categories like toys, household products and travel, kids have an outsized say.
Parents don’t think about ads as much because they’re so inundated with ads in their daily lives. They see ads everywhere. Kids don’t get ads as much. 76% of kids ask for things that they see advertised, and 46% of those sales are attributed to the influence of the kids on the parents. Our audience buys more.
You’re speaking to such a coveted demographic. What advice would you give to other marketers who are trying to speak to that demographic in any medium?
The most important thing is establishing trust, feeling like the messaging is authentic, and doing anything they can to remove distractions. When you advertise over Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, you are catching people in a moment where they are frantically scrolling on their phone, not really paying attention to your message. Being able to create an environment where you have a true one-on-one non distracted and trusted moment is the most impactful thing a marketer can do with our demographic, or any demographic.

From the MBA: Mortgage Applications Decrease in Latest MBA Weekly Survey Mortgage applications decreased 1.6 percent from one week 
earlier, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) Weekly Mortgage Applications 
Survey for the week ending March 28, 2025.

The Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, decreased 1.6 percent on 
a seasonally adjusted basis from one week earlier. On an unadjusted basis, the Index decreased 1 
percent compared with the previous week. The Refinance Index decreased 6 percent from the previous 
week and was 57 percent higher than the same week one year ago. The seasonally adjusted Purchase 
Index increased 2 percent from one week earlier. The unadjusted Purchase Index increased 2 percent 
compared with the previous week and was 9 percent higher than the same week one year ago.
 
“Treasury yields continue to be volatile as economic uncertainty dominates markets. Most mortgage rates 
finished last week lower, with the 30-year fixed essentially unchanged at 6.70 percent. Last week’s level 
of purchase applications was its highest since the end of January, driven by a 3 percent increase in 
conventional purchases, while government purchase applications were down 2 percent,” said Joel Kan, 
MBA’s Vice President and Deputy Chief Economist. “Overall purchase activity has shown year-over-year 
growth for more than two months as the inventory of existing homes for sale continues to increase, a 
positive development for the housing market despite the uncertain near-term outlook. Refinance 
applications were down almost 6 percent last week and remain very sensitive to rate movements, as most 
borrowers have mortgages with lower rates.”   
...
The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances 
($806,500 or less) decreased to 6.70 percent from 6.71 percent, with points increasing to 0.62 from 0.60 
(including the origination fee) for 80 percent loan-to-value ratio (LTV) loans.

80,2025-04-02,"In the third act of its dramatic debut as a public company, conservative media company Newsmax faced a harsh reality as its stock lost a sizable chunk of its early gains, though it remains valued favorably compared to comparable companies, with one notable exception: The parent of President Donald Trump’s Truth Social.
Even after crashing down to earth Wednesday, Newsmax is still valued at an extreme premium compared ... More to Fox and the New York Times.
Shares of Newsmax tanked as much as 50% to below $120 by late morning Wednesday before recovering slightly to a 45% loss, shedding more than $10 billion in value as its market capitalization dropped from $20.7 billion to $11 billion, according to Yahoo Finance.
Newsmax stock is still up about 1,200% from its initial public offering price of $10.
As such, Newsmax’s valuation remains far loftier than the typical stock’s compared to the company’s financial performance.
In 2024, Newsmax reported a $72 million net loss on $171 million of revenue, meaning its price-to-sales ratio is a sky high 63.9 (the commonly used price-to-sales ratio compares Newsmax’s $11 billion market capitalization to its last 12-month sales).
The S&P 500’s average price-to-sales ratio is 2.9, according to FactSet, meaning that Newsmax enjoys a more than 22 times premium compared to the average stock listed on the bellwether U.S. stock index.
Newsmax made waves Tuesday when it briefly surpassed Fox Corp, parent of its top competitor in right-wing media in Fox News, in terms of market value, perhaps a surprise considering Fox’s far more robust financials. Fox made $2 million on $15 billion of revenue last year, and its 1.7 price-to-sales is 2.7% of Newsmax’s. Other pure play media stocks like the New York Times (3.2 price-to-sales) and local television titan Nexstar Media (1.1 price-to-sales) also enjoy far less friendly valuations than Newsmax, which is still worth more than those two profitable companies. But one company which fetches a far loftier valuation than Newsmax is Trump Media & Technology Group, majority owned by the president. Trump Media has a market cap of $4.5 billion despite losing $400 million on $4 million in revenue last year, equating to a price-to-sales of 807.
Chris Ruddy, Newsmax’s billionaire founder and CEO, told CNBC on Monday “we see ourselves as a growth stock,” helping explain why investors flocked to Newsmax shares other than meme stock momentum. To Ruddy’s point, Newsmax revenue jumped more than 25% from 2023 to 2024. It’s also common for newly public companies to fetch high relative share prices shortly after their IPO as investors bet a company can grow into its valuation. For example, Facebook profited just $670 million off of $3.7 billion in sales during 2011, the final year before its IPO, growing exponentially to a $62 billion profit on $165 billion in sales by 2024.

California-based Alef Aeronautics has successfully tested its bizarre electric flying car more than a year and a half after it made headlines for its progress.
On the ground, it looks sort of like the 1960s Batmobile. In the air, spectators might mistake it for a flying saucer. It's strangely sleek and outlandish at the same time, largely due to its mostly mesh exterior, according to photos shared by Electrek.
But none of the visuals matter much as long as it can fly. A 53-second clip shared on YouTube by Urdesign proves the concept. The long, flat vehicle with a circular cockpit is shown flying what looks like around 12 feet in the air, easily clearing other vehicles.
""This drive and flight test represents an important proof of technology in a real-world city environment,"" Alef CEO Jim Dukhovny said in a Urdesignmag story.
The car is designed to soar over traffic jams, going from the road to the air seamlessly without a runway. It's sort of like the electric vertical takeoff and landing taxis by Archer Aviation and other companies that are beginning flights. Alef's Model Zero leverages electric power for liftoff with rotors. An ultra-light version was used for testing, all per Urdesignmag.
The article provides an apt description of its appearance: Its ""mesh exterior conceals four rotors in the front and four in the rear, replacing a typical engine to provide lift. The passenger cabin is centrally located on a pivoting platform.""
While the contraption can essentially long jump gridlock — a time-saving move shown in an Alef rendering — the prototype won't outrun many cars. It goes about 25 miles per hour, per Urdesignmag. Electrek listed its driving range at 220 miles, with a flight ability of 110 miles — all with electric power.
Battery-powered tech continues to advance. The median electric vehicle range for model year 2023 is 270 miles, according to the U.S. government. That's far above the typical American's daily commute of just under 40 miles, Kelley Blue Book reported. Charge times are also becoming shorter, as fast stalls such as Tesla's Superchargers are open to most models (with an adapter) and can provide a couple hundred miles in around 15 minutes.
Alef, Archer, and others are providing EV versions of what could become common, cleaner urban conveyances. The Megalux is another example. It's a solar-powered, boatlike car that was showcased at a United Arab Emirates tech event. But it's more demonstrative than practical.
Model Zero is meant to enter the market, though Urdesignmag labeled it as Alef's ""long-term vision."" The company's leaders have already earned some government flight certificates as testing continues. The ambitious goal is to have a flight-capable, four-person sedan on the market by 2035 at a cost of around $35,000.
Could flying cars ever become our main transportation method?
   No way   
   Maybe in 100 years   
   Maybe in 50 years   
   It could happen soon   
Click your choice to see results and speak your mind.
The company's more commercial design, the Model A, reportedly has more than 3,300 preorders already in place at a projected cost of $299,999, all per Urdesignmag.
Another big win for EVs is efficiency and heat-trapping air pollution reduction. A popular Tesla Model 3 is up to three times more efficient than even a hybrid Toyota Prius, according to EnergySage. Each EV that replaces a gas-guzzler prevents thousands of pounds of tailpipe exhaust from being spewed annually. The fumes are linked to cancer, lung, heart, and other health risks, all according to government emissions and medical data.
Switching to an EV can save you up to $1,500 on gas and maintenance costs annually, in addition to tax breaks to help with the purchase.
Soon, you might be able to save some time by simply flying over traffic congestion if Alef's vision comes to fruition.
""We hope it will be a moment similar to the Wright Brothers' Kitty Hawk video, proving to humanity that new transportation is possible,"" Dukhovny said, per Urdesignmag.

Warren Buffett has made billions of dollars over the years by ensuring all sorts of perils. If the risk is priced correctly, insurance companies can earn attractive returns by taking in premiums today while assuming a small probability of a large payout down the road. Still, insurance companies are exposed to tail risk, which is the occasional outsized loss due to an extraordinary event that causes huge losses.
That’s where catastrophe bonds, also known as insurance linked securities, come into play. These bonds allow insurance companies to offset some of the tail risk in their portfolios, providing them with regulatory capital relief and allowing them to earn a higher return on equity. By removing some potential losses in a catastrophic situation — think of a category five hurricane that wipes out hundreds of multimillion-dollar mansions along Florida’s east coast between Miami and Palm Beach — insurance companies can hold less capital in reserve to pay claims.
Investors in catastrophe bonds receive periodic payments similar to those in other types of bonds, but the return of principal is dependent on whether or not an extreme natural disaster creates total losses beyond a certain point.
The structure is relatively straightforward. An insurance company issues bonds through an investment bank, which are then sold to investors with maturities typically ranging from one to five years. Investors receive their principal plus coupon payments if no qualifying catastrophe occurs during the bond’s term.
However, if a predefined disaster happens, the principal may be partially or wholly forgiven, allowing the insurance company to use these funds to pay policyholder claims. Like other structured credit bonds, catastrophe bonds are issued with varying degrees of risk, ranging from AAA-rated to below investment grade.
It’s important to note that every natural disaster does not lead to losses for investors in catastrophe bonds. Investor losses are only triggered in extreme situations, such as Hurricane Katrina. Even the recent California wildfires — where projected losses are expected to be $35 to $50 billion — are not likely to result in losses for most bondholders.
Historically, cat bonds have delivered attractive risk-adjusted returns for investors compared to other assets. The Swiss Re Cat Bond Index has demonstrated strong performance in recent years, notably achieving a 17.29% return in 2024 and a record 19.69% in 2023. Between 2002 and 2023, the annualized return was 6.7%, a premium over 5.4% over one-month Treasury bills.
Perhaps the most compelling feature of catastrophe bonds for investors is their remarkably low correlation with traditional financial markets. According to Morningstar, cat bonds have delivered stable returns with a 0.24 correlation to stocks over the last two decades.
Access to the market has generally been contained to institutional investors. That changed with the April 1st launch of the Brookmont Catastrophic Bond ETF, ILS. The ETF claims to exclusively hold catastrophe bonds linked to natural disasters driven by randomly occurring climate and weather-related events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods.
“ILS delivers a low-correlation, high-yield alternative to traditional bonds at a time when investors are seeking new sources of income and diversification,” said Ethan Powell, Principal & Chief Investment Officer of Brookmont Capital Management, in a press release about the launch of the new fund. The ETF will hold a portfolio of up to 75 catastrophe bonds, providing investors with diversified exposure across different perils, regions, and trigger mechanisms.
The California wildfires in January caused some weakness in the catastrophe bond market, creating a buying opportunity for new investors. According to Artemis, catastrophe bonds yielded 10.43% at the end of March. With expert modeling loss predictions of 2.23%, investors still have a significant excess spread. Compared to the yield of 7.5% for high-yield bonds, cat bonds offer an attractive potential total return that has historically been uncorrelated with other risk assets.
With a total expected expense ratio of 1.58%, the fund has considerably higher costs than stock or bond ETFs. However, it appears to be competitive with mutual fund alternatives, such as the SHRIX, Stone Ridge’s High Yield Reinsurance Risk Premium Fund. By comparison, SHRIX has an expense ratio of 1.76%.
For investors seeking to build all-weather portfolios that can withstand diverse market conditions, catastrophe bonds offer meaningful diversification benefits. While investors must account for the risk of natural disasters, they can worry less about stock market volatility."

In a craft store in Lahore, I reached for the same quirky handmade lamp as Isabella, a scientist ""with a spark of curiosity.""

        Sitting in my Singapore office — not on a K-Drama stage, or in Pakistan — I played Tinder's new game to practice my charm.
    

        Called The Game Game, this new in-app feature uses speech-to-speech AI technology to create ""over-the-top, meet-cute scenarios,"" Tinder said in a statement on Tuesday.
    

        Users try to flirt their way to a date, while AI dishes out real-time feedback and rates their game. I used my editor's US phone in a private room so my colleagues didn't overhear me talking to Isabella.
    

        Flirty wins earned me points with labels like ""delightful,"" ""charming,"" and ""victory."" Rack up enough, and it'll secure you a date with the AI.
    

        I was given about five minutes to flirt in each scenario. And I had 10 scenarios to play with in the free account.
    

        The game is powered by OpenAI's GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, and Tinder says your awkward pickup lines won't be used to train any AI models. It's only available to iOS users in the US for a limited time.
    

        A spokesperson for Tinder's parent company, Match Group, said the company is using the game ""to learn and explore what future rollouts in other markets might look like.""
    

        The game comes as Match struggles with lower user numbers. The company's new CEO has said he wants to bring the focus back to users.
    

        ""This project gave us a chance to experiment with how AI can make dating a little more fun and a little less intimidating,"" said Alex Osborne, Match's senior director of product innovation.
    

        Match's stock is down 10.8% in the last year, while rival Bumble is down 61%.
    

        My first scenario was labeled ""Easy,"" and I brought my usual self to the scenario.
    

        Isabella started off strong, asking what brought me here. I complimented the lamp and said I liked crafts. I asked her what her favorite item in the store was, and she launched into a monologue about a handwoven carpet.
    

        Without a visual, it was hard to relate. And she sounded robotic.
    

        Hoping to steer flirtier, I asked what else she liked. She listed pottery, then asked if I was into it. I said yes — cue her AI-generated wisdom about the joy of surrounding yourself with things you make with your own hands.
    

        I took my shot: ""What do you like making with your hands?"" (Cringe.)
    

        Her answer: Custom lab notebooks and DIY molecular models. Hot.
    

        I feigned interest, the conversation fizzled, and I didn't score a date. Tinder handed me some generic flirting tips, like ""ask more about her favorite crafts."" Thanks, AI wingman.
    

        Next, a shot at romance with Jackson, a photographer at a lively block party. We were manning the grill together — prime flirting conditions, and I dialed it up.
    

        When Jackson suggested a ""nice, sweet tea to cool off,"" I leaned in: ""I've never tried that but I do want someone to cool me off.""
    

        ""Well, now, a glass of sweet tea is perfect,"" he said. (Dodge. But Tinder awarded me points.)
    

        So I upped the ante. When he asked about challenges I've faced, I dropped: ""Not being able to keep my eyes off you.""
    

        His reaction? ""Well, now, that sure is kind of you to say."" Then he suggested we find a comfy spot to chat.
    

        If a real person said that, they'd either be deeply into me or deeply uncomfortable. But Tinder? It just kept handing out points — until I actually scored a date.
    

        So, the lesson? Be bold, be flirty, and apparently, AI won't call you out for being too much.
    

        Lastly, I stood in line at a food truck in Venice. Paisley, an architect, struck up a conversation with me about culinary adventures.
    

        This time, I was the human equivalent of dry toast.
    

        Paisley kicked things off, raving about a truffle mushroom pasta —""a masterpiece.""
    

        Me? ""Never tried it.""
    

        She asked what cuisine I liked. I hit her with the dullest answer possible: ""Chicken.""
    

        Paisley chirped: ""Versatile and always delicious!"" (In real life, this is where I'd get ghosted.)
    

        Still, she pressed on. ""Have you tried any Indian or Thai chicken dishes?""
    

        ""No.""
    

        She tried again. ""Do you like exploring new recipes?""
    

        ""I don't cook.""
    

        At this point, I was sure she'd give up. But nope: ""Let's plan a little food adventure! What do you think?""
    

        ""Okay.""
    

        No surprise — I didn't score a date. But Paisley's enthusiasm never wavered. No matter how boring I got, she stayed locked in.
    

        Tinder's AI might handle flirty, but it refuses to acknowledge flop energy.
    

        All in all, I couldn't take this game seriously.
    

Correction: April 2, 2025 — An earlier version of this story misstated the day Tinder announced its new game. It was Tuesday, not Monday.

86,2025-04-02,"Walmart’s big pay bump for its store managers is paying off, according to U.S. CEO John Furner.
Speaking at the National Retail Federation (NRF) State of Retail & the Consumer 2025, Furner highlighted the company’s efforts to boost engagement and performance across its management ranks. 
“What we did last year was make managers feel like owners,” Furner said. “This includes shareholding, which has positively impacted their approach to the company’s profits and losses.” 
Furner pointed out a clear shift in manager behavior, noting a “difference” in how they discuss the business, the types of questions they ask, and how they approach the profit and loss statement. This change is partly due to encouraging managers to think of Walmart as if they owned it, he said.
In January, Walmart (WMT) raised compensation for its regional store managers, with top performers now earning between $420,000 and $620,000. The pay boost includes higher stock grants and annual bonuses, with the latter reaching 100% of base pay. The retail giant employs more than 4,000 store managers across the U.S. 
Walmart also has made a concerted effort to boost pay and benefits for hourly workers, aiming to reduce turnover and remain competitive in a tight labor market. However, the company has scaled back perks for its office-based staff, including changes to healthcare plans and end of remote work for some corporate employees outside of its headquarters.
While Walmart’s store manager strategy shows promise, the company is bracing for slower growth in 2025. In February, the retailer warned this year may not replicate the record gains seen in 2024, which were largely driven by higher-income shoppers earning over $100,000, and accounted for 75% of the company’s market share growth. 
Walmart, America’s largest private employer, is facing challenges as it prepares for President Donald Trump’s tariffs. The company recently doubled down on its earlier stance, asking Chinese suppliers to cover the costs of U.S. tariffs. Other major retailers like Costco and Target have made similar moves. However, despite these efforts to reduce exposure, U.S. consumers may ultimately bear the brunt of the impact.

Donald Trump has called tariffs the “most beautiful word” in the dictionary. He’s said they will make Americans “rich” and restructure the economy for the better. Standing in the Rose Garden on Wednesday, with political and business leaders around the world watching closely, Trump bet his faith in tariffs against the hard reality of economics as he launched what is expected to be one of the single largest increases in U.S. trade barriers in a century.

Trump announced he was signing an executive order “instituting reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world. Reciprocal—that means they do it to us and we do it to them.” In practice, the White House said that will translate into a new 10 percent tariff on all imported goods, and additional import taxes on 60 other countries. Those additional tariffs vary and were determined by looking at the rules in those countries around U.S. exports, according to the White House.
Trump’s new tariff regime will be on top of various tariffs the U.S. already has in place, and ones Trump had already set in motion targeting imports of cars, steel and aluminum. The reciprocal tariffs would go into effect Thursday, he said.
Speaking to staff, cabinet secretaries and reporters gathered outside the West Wing, Trump gave a rambling and sometimes contradictory explanation of his tariff plan. He said that his administration would calculate what a country charges the U.S. imports through tariffs, “non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating” and would charge the country half of that in a flat rate. The new tariffs were not a “full reciprocal,” he said. “I would like to have done that.”
Reading from a large chart, he said goods coming from China, for example, would be charged a duty of 34%, goods from the European Union would carry a 20% tariff, Vietnam would have 35% and Taiwan 32%. An eight-page chart handed out to reporters in the Rose Garden listed 60 countries as being charged rates above the baseline of 10%.
Trump had previously announced a separate 25% tariff on all auto imports that is slated to kick in on April 3. He’s imposed 20% tariffs on all imports coming from China and put in place 25% duties on steel and aluminum. He had previously delayed 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada over his accusation that those countries weren’t doing enough to stop fentanyl from coming to the U.S. That delayed tariff kicks in Wednesday and will be stacked on top of the new sweeping tariffs Trump announced.
Trump has called the day of his announcement “Liberation Day” and billed it as a moment he is remaking the American economy.  He promised that income from the new tariffs would reduce taxes and pay down U.S. debt.
American businesses have struggled in recent weeks to plan ahead as Trump’s tariff threats have injected so much uncertainty into their supply chains. Stock indices have dipped. Expectations of inflation have soared. Investors are rattled. Last month, JPMorgan Chase lowered its prediction for GDP growth by 0.3% because of the uncertainty around Trump’s trade policy.
Leading economists say the costs of tariffs are mostly passed on to consumers. On the campaign trail last year, Trump often disputed that. More recently, he has said Americans will have to brace for some temporary economic pain in order to strengthen the U.S. economy over the longer term. But he didn’t mention that on Wednesday.
Trump's announcement will test his support among Republicans in Congress—all of whom will be hearing about the fallout from their constituents. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley expressed concerns about how the new tariffs will impact farmers in his state. As an example of the ripple effect, he pointed to potash, a fertilizer from Canada that is essential for soybean production. “If that goes up by 25% that's going to hurt the family farm already not making money,” he tells TIME.

88,2025-04-02,"Hims & Hers (HIMS) stock slid Wednesday, a day after the company announced new weight-loss drug offerings — an update that left investors unimpressed.
Shares of the digital healthcare platform, which caters to millennials, fell as much as 6.8% before rebounding. The stock then dipped more than 4% in after-hours trading.
The selloff followed Hims & Hers’ announcement that it had added Eli Lilly’s (LLY) popular weight-loss drug Zepbound and a generic GLP-1 medication to its platform. 
The news comes in response to a recent decision by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which removed semaglutide — the active ingredient in Novo Nordisk’s (NVO) Ozempic and Wegovy — from the agency’s shortage list. As a result, Hims & Hers will soon have to limit its previous offerings of the drug.
Last May, the company began selling compounded semaglutide — an off-brand version of Ozempic — starting at $199 a month. That helped drive the company’s total revenue up 69% last year, reaching $1.5 billion.
But now that the drug is no longer in short supply, Hims & Hers will only be able to sell personalized and clinically necessary formulations of compounded semaglutide in order to comply with current drug regulations.
The company’s newest offerings come with a steep price tag: Zepbound costs $1,899 a month, while its generic liraglutide is priced at $299 a month, according to the company’s website.
Wall Street hasn’t been enthusiastic about at least one of these new options.
“We view HIMS’ decision to sell branded tirzepatide as a way to provide more options to consumers, but would expect volume and revenue to be immaterial — even over an extended period of time,” Bank of America (BAC) analyst Allen Lutz wrote in a note Tuesday. “We find it incredibly unlikely a consumer would go to HIMS to buy any branded GLP-1 for $1,899/month.”
Instead, analysts are waiting to see on how well the company’s generic liraglutide performs.
Hims & Hers first announced plans in November to introduce a generic version of liraglutide, an older GLP-1 weight-loss drug, this year. Unlike newer options that require weekly injections, liraglutide is taken daily. It is currently sold under Novo Nordisk’s Saxenda brand, though many of its patents have expired.
In a 56-week clinical trial, patients taking the once-daily injection lost more than 5% of their body weight on average. By comparison, those taking the highest dose of Eli Lilly’s weekly-injectable Zepbound lost more than 20% of their weight after 72 weeks in clinical trials.
“We think monitoring HIMS’ liraglutide launch will be relevant over the next year,” Lutz wrote. “If HIMS is able to generate commercial success for liraglutide, it would represent a significant milestone and validate the strength of HIMS’ brand, in our view.”

90,2025-04-02,"Despite taking a hit earlier in the day from weak deliveries, Tesla (TSLA) stock is now soaring as Elon Musk’s time in the federal government appears to be nearing an end.
Politico, citing people familiar with the matter, reports that President Donald Trump and Musk have agreed that the Tesla CEO should take on a supporting role, rather than a leadership one, over the next few weeks. Musk will likely stay on informally as an advisor and continue to stay in the president’s orbit, according to the report. 
After Musk became Trump’s biggest financial supporter on the campaign trail, the Tesla CEO was given a role leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which has been directed to slash government spending. He was named a special government employee, a role that exempts him from some ethics rules — but that only allows such staffers to work for 130 days; the period is set to expire in late May or early June.
“Elon Musk and President Trump have both *publicly* stated that Elon will depart from public service as a special government employee when his incredible work at DOGE is complete,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a post on Musk’s X (formerly Twitter), replying to the author of Politico’s report. 
The reminder of Musk’s limited timeline for officially working in the White House was welcomed by investors. Tesla stock climbed 5% in intraday trading — after falling by about the same amount earlier in the day. The stock is down by more than 25% year-to-date.
Backlash over DOGE has been swift and has grown in recent weeks as the group continues to direct the Trump administration’s approach to downsizing the government. Musk claimed last week that DOGE cuts an average of $4 billion in federal spending each day.
Tesla has become an easy target for protesters angered by Musk’s support of Trump and his work in the federal government. Nonviolent, anti-Tesla protests have been held across the U.S. and other countries, while vandalism against the company’s customers and facilities has ramped up.
“What they’re trying to do is put massive pressure on me and Tesla, I guess, to, you know, I don’t know, stop doing this,” Musk said Sunday. “My Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone, went roughly in half. I mean, it’s a big deal.”
On Wednesday morning, Tesla reported first-quarter sales of more than 336,681 electric vehicles, far less than Wall Street expected. Analysts have been lowering their forecasts for weeks as the “Tesla Takedown” protests have continued. Deepwater Asset Management’s Gene Munster estimates that Tesla lost about 80,000 deliveries as a result of brand damage.
“We are not going to look at these numbers with rose-colored glasses...they were a disaster on every metric,” Wedbush Securities analyst and Tesla bull Dan Ives said in a Wednesday note. “The more political [Musk] gets with DOGE the more the brand suffers, there is no debate.”
“The future is so bright but this is a full blown crisis Tesla is navigating now and its primarily self-inflected,” he added.

93,2025-04-02,"A trust overseeing President Donald Trump’s multi-billion dollar stake in Truth Social’s (DWAC) parent company could sell up to 115 million shares, according to a regulatory filing.
Trump Media and Technology Group stock dropped as much as 9% on the news, before paring back some of those losses. The stock, which has often been described as a meme stock, has shed 44% of its value since Jan. 1. 
Trump Media on Tuesday filed to register up to 142.5 million shares and warrants for sale, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes 114.75 million shares of common stock held by Trump’s trust, which is controlled by Donald Trump, Jr., the president’s eldest son. Axios first reported on the filing. 
The SEC will need to consider the filing effective before stockholders such as Trump’s trust and ARC Global, which sponsored Trump Media’s special-purpose acquisition company, can sell their shares. 
Trump’s ownership of Trump Media, valued at roughly $2.1 billion, made him one of the world’s 500 richest people last year, with a fortune of as much as $6.5 billion. Forbes now estimates his fortune at about $4.7 billion.
In a statement, Trump Media denied that the filing indicates Trump’s trust or other insiders plan to sell their shares.
“To be clear, these shares were already registered last June on an S-1 form, and today TMTG submitted a routine filing that re-registers them on an S-3 form in order to keep the Company’s filings effective,” the company said. “In fact, there currently is no open window for any affiliate to sell shares.”
Last year, the president, amid speculation that he may sell his stake after a six-month lockup period ended, said he wouldn’t sell his stake in the company. 
“The reason I built it is because I don’t want to have my voice shut down,” Trump said during a press conference at his golf course near Los Angeles in September. “A lot of people think that I will sell my shares, you know, they’re worth billions of dollars, but I don’t want to sell my shares. I don’t need money.”
The filing comes as another company that trades in politics, Newsmax, has a dizzying first week as a public company. The conservative television network’s stock has soared by more than 623% since it debuted on the New York Stock Exchange, making founder Christopher Ruddy a billionaire. The stock was down 45% in intraday trading Wednesday morning.
Trump launched Truth Social after being banned from major social media platforms like Facebook (META) and Twitter in 2021. Its parent company recently launched a streaming platform, expanded to offer investment vehicles, established a strategic acquisition fund, and became the first company to list on the NYSE’s Texas branch. The firm reported less than $4 million in sales last year, with a net loss of roughly $401 million.

94,2025-04-02,"Conservative TV company Newsmax has seen its stock market valuation surge by more than 2,200% since its debut in New York on Monday.
The US firm's shares, which were originally priced at $10 (£7.75) each, stood at $233 at the end of Tuesday's trading session.
That means it has a market value of almost $30bn, which surpasses Fox Corp - the owner of rival Fox News - and other media giants Warner Bros Discovery and Paramount Global.
Newsmax is seen as friendly to US President Donald Trump and was promoted by him during his first term in the White House.
The share price surge has made Newsmax's founder and chief executive Christopher Ruddy one of the richest people in the US, with a net worth of more than $9bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
Analysts said retail investors drove gains, drawing comparisons to the soaring price of GameStop.
The video game retailer's popularity among some investors during the pandemic helped coin the idea of meme stocks.
The meme-stock phenomenon was part of a wider increase in trading by retail investors - people not working for investment houses or other private firms.
Newsmax was founded in 1998 as an online platform. It launched its cable news channel in 2014.
Its ratings were boosted in 2020 when it was endorsed by Trump, who had become increasingly angry at Fox News.
Mr Ruddy, who is a friend of Trump, insisted at the time that he did not want Newsmax to become ""Trump TV"".
Earlier this month, Newsmax paid $40m to settle allegations that it defamed voting machine company Smartmatic by reporting false claims that it helped rig the 2020 election for Joe Biden.
It is the latest company with ties to conservatives to start selling shares on the stock market, joining Canada-based video platform Rumble Inc and President Trump's media venture, Trump Media & Technology Group.

Dealers are looking to sell as many vehicles as possible among inventory on the ground ahead of the ... More imposition of import tariffs that are likely to trigger price hikes on some cars and trucks.
There’s no time to waste to move the 60-to-90 days supply of cars and trucks off lots of the Rohrman Automotive Group’s 22 franchises. The CEO Ryan Rohrman figures once 25% import tariffs kick in on Thursday, it will be two or three weeks before higher-priced vehicles arrive.
The game plan for the Lafayette, Indiana-based dealer group? Sell as many pre-tariff cars as possible, says Rohrman, since he’s hearing that prices for vehicles subject to the tariffs will increase 5% to 10%.
Ryan Rohrman, CEO, Rohrman Automotive Group, based in Lafayette, Indiana. ... More 
“If the average car right now is just shy of $40,000, you’re looking at potentially up to, like a $3,500- to-$4,000 price increase,” Rohrman said in an interview. “With the margins that we have on cars that would be very hard to sell if I have a pre-tariff car on the lot that's the same. I can't have a pre-tariff car compete with the same exact car that's $4,000 more.” 
Since dealers must pay steep insurance rates on every vehicle on their lots, there’s additional incentive to move them quickly, even if discounting shaves profit margins, Rohrman explained.
The result could be a bit of a gold-rush mentality among some consumers looking to score deals before pre-tariff inventories are sold out, giving first-quarter sales a late bump.
Indeed, once President Trump announced on March 26 that he was going ahead with import tariffs, it helped push new-car retail sales up by nearly 30% month-over-month, according to a report released Tuesday by the car shopping site CarGurus.
But once tariffs go into effect, the affordability of new vehicles — which are already at historic highs — becomes even more challenging for many consumers.
Chart from CarGurus 2025 Q1 Quarterly Review, showing how much average new vehicle prices could rise ... More with import tariffs.
“Only 13% of new cars today are priced under $30,000, down sharply from 37% just five years ago—and that share is expected to shrink even further once tariffs are in effect,” wrote CarGurus director of economic and market intelligence Kevin Roberts. “Shoppers hoping to lock in pre-tariff pricing on popular import models—many priced under $40,000—will face mounting pressure, especially with high-demand vehicles like the Toyota RAV4 and Honda Civic sitting at just about a one-month supply.”
Cox Automotive senior economist Charlie Chesbrough warns that the opportunity to find pre-tariff bargains won’t last long.
“I expect we’ll see relatively strong sales activity for a month or two, but prices will rise, and sales will slow noticeably before the end of Q2,” Chesbrough wrote in a report released Monday. “Dealers and OEMs will be pulling back on incentives immediately as the rush to sell existing inventory declines. The value of an unsold vehicle on a dealer’s lot is now worth X-percent more since its replacement cost will be much higher.”
The nature of the business is operating on thin profit margins. When the market was disrupted during the Covid pandemic it resulted in a consolidation of the overall dealer network due to closings or takeovers by large groups.
If sales and profits suffer because of a loss of sales and the need to discount as the effects of import tariffs take hold, the situation could repeat itself. It’s already starting.
“Right now, it is an accelerant for groups that were already on the fence for considering selling because they know that this is not something that’s going to go away tomorrow or next week or next month, because even aside from the tariffs, some of it is caused by the uncertainty with tariffs, but we still have, I would say, a questionable economic environment right now,” said Brian Gordon, president of the Dave Cantin Group, in an interview. His firm brokers dealership mergers and acquisitions,
A major challenge for dealers: When Trump states a policy then changes his mind or alters his course of action.
As Gordon points out, uncertainty stalls both businesses and consumers, creating an urgency to just know what’s actually going to happen.
“Just tell us what’s happening so we can make business decisions,” Gordon said. “Because President Trump--whether he’s using something as a negotiation tactic and then backing off, or whatever it may be, finding that definitive, okay, this is how it's going to be for some period of time has been really challenging, not just with tariffs, but with a number of different, you know, policies.”
One big business decision is whether or not to downsize staffing at dealerships should sales and profits sharply decline over the long-haul.
It’s something on the mind of Rohrman, thinking about his business’s 1,400 employees.
“If that happens where we have to resort back to layoffs because of tariffs or whatnot, it would, it would definitely be something that I would not jump to do,” he said. “We spend so much time in training and hiring our employees, it would just be a shame to see that as a side effect of it.”
Right now Rohrman would just like to know what the automakers plan to do in terms of pricing and production. He said so far all he’s received are emails from two manufacturers without much information.
“None of the brands that we sell have given us any direction at all in terms of, even if something does happen or it doesn’t what we should expect,"" he said.
Gordon says what dealers should expect is to roll with it and adjust. “Well, if these tariffs are here to stay, that just creates a new norm,” he said."

Europe's best hope for an EV battery manufacturer reached the end of the road last month.

        Northvolt, the EV battery maker founded by two former Tesla executives and backed by the likes of Volkswagen and Goldman Sachs, filed for bankruptcy after running out of cash.
    

        The startup's demise after burning through $15 billion poses big questions for European policymakers — and leaves the field open for a Chinese battery titan to continue its global expansion.
    

CATL, the world's biggest battery producer, is already building three factories in Europe — in Germany, Hungary, and a joint venture with Jeep owner Stellantis in Spain. A spokesperson told Business Insider the company was considering expanding its manufacturing facilities further, in line with market demand.
    

        CATL is also embarking on a hiring spree, recruiting about 1,800 employees at its German plant and planning to add more than 1,300 staff in Hungary by the end of the year.
    

        As scrutiny over Chinese firms operating in Europe escalates in recent years, manufacturers including CATL and BYD have sought to localize production by building factories in European countries.
    

        In CATL's case, the push to blend in reportedly included adding bratwurst and German barbecue to the menu at its German factory.
    

        As well as building batteries, CATL is also looking at ways to recycle them.
    

        A spokesperson told BI the company was ""exploring strategic partnerships"" with local firms to build a battery recycling network in Europe.
    

        The European scale-up comes at a key moment for CATL, which has grown rapidly thanks to enormous state support and China's stranglehold over the global battery supply chain.
    

        CATL is gearing up to go public in Hong Kong in a $5 billion offering and recently struck a deal with Chinese EV maker Nio to develop a battery-swapping network for electric vehicles in China.
    

        The demise of Northvolt, widely seen as the continent's most promising battery startup, has left Europe's home-grown battery industry struggling to compete.
    

        ""Northvolt bit off more than it could chew,"" said Sam Jaffe, principal at 1019 Technologies, which advises companies on the battery industry. ""They were trying to build six gigafactories in different parts of the world all at once, and they should have just concentrated on just one.""
    

        Jaffe said Northvolt's investors were expecting unrealistic ""venture-like"" returns from the capital-intensive business.
    

        While Northvolt's failure won't be a ""death knell"" for Europe's efforts to build EV batteries, he said ownership of the continent's battery industry was likely to be dominated by Chinese and Asian companies.
    

        That prospect has sparked some soul-searching in Europe. Julia Poliscanova, a senior director of the Transport & Environment thinktank, said the European Union had failed to turn world-class battery R&D into a successful manufacturing sector: ""Northvolt is just a symptom of the problems that we have in Europe.""
    

        She said the EU should learn from the ""Chinese playbook"" as it looks to build a competitor to CATL, sticking with consistent EV policies and overhauling trade rules that allow Chinese battery makers to import their products at a 1.3% tariff.
    

        Poliscanova also urged Europe to explore measures that would force Chinese manufacturers to partner with European rivals and share vital knowledge if they want to do business on the continent.
    

        China adopted similar joint-venture rules with its auto industry in the 1990s. They proved a powerful tool in helping Chinese carmakers catch up with Western competitors.
    

        ""The Chinese didn't wake up being good at battery manufacturing — they've simply been doing it for a lot more years,"" said Poliscanova. ""The problem is that today in Europe, we don't have all those years to learn and fail.""
    

        Shifting geopolitical tensions are likely to only make Europe a more tempting target for Chinese firms.
    

        China's EV giants such as BYD have been locked out of the US by high tariffs, but are expanding rapidly in Europe due to less restrictive trade barriers. Jaffe said the battery industry could follow a similar playbook.
    

        ""I think we're going to see a clear demarcation between the North American battery industry, which is going to be mostly Korean partnerships with local companies, and the European battery industry, which is going to be more partnerships with Chinese manufacturers,"" he said.
