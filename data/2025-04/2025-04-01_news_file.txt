Good morning. Congratulations to Vice President JD Vance, who sold his home just outside Washington, DC, for $172,000 over the asking price after less than three weeks on the market. The buyer? A former Trump official.

        In today's big story, investors are shocked to be battling against President Donald Trump as the stock market closed its worst quarter in three years.
    

What's on deck


Markets: BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is setting his sights on private markets.
    

Tech: Move over, Disney. YouTube is about to dominate media.
    

Business: America has an affordable housing problem. Paris has the solution.
    

        But first, there may be more pain ahead for Wall Street.
    

If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.


Investors have come to a grim realization: Trump's not in their corner.


        The stock market on Monday wrapped up its worst quarter since 2022.
    

        After back-to-back years of double-digit gains, yesterday's plunge showed just how much Trump has surprised markets since returning to the White House.
    

        It seems he is no longer the market's champion. The White House has telegraphed its position stating as much, BI's Jennifer Sor writes.
    

        ""Wall Street's done great, Wall Street can continue to do fine, but we have a focus on small business and consumers,"" the Treasury secretary said last month. Instead of equity prices, the White House is focusing on the 10-year Treasury yield to lower borrowing costs.
    

        Meanwhile, inflation and recession fears have intensified under Trump's tariff campaign. Consumer sentiment has dropped to multi-year lows and CEO confidence is spiraling as planning for the future becomes more difficult.
    

To make matters worse, investors should prepare for another three months of pain ahead.


Once-bullish investors are feeling shellshocked coming into the second quarter.
    

        ""The expected fallout from Trump 2.0's Reign of Tariffs undercuts our former bullishness and dims the prospects of our base-case Roaring 2020s scenario for now,"" veteran analyst Ed Yardeni wrote. He lowered his S&P 500 year-end target to 6,100 from a prior forecast of 6,400.
    

        At the same time, Goldman Sachs cut its three-month target for the index to 5,300, a possible 5% drop from current levels.
    

        It's now the eve of Trump's ""Liberation Day,"" and investors are nervously awaiting the unveiling of a range of reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners. With so much uncertainty ahead, Deutsche Bank flagged three risks to watch in the coming quarter.
    

1. Floyd Mayweather's big commercial real estate boasts don't match reality. The retired boxing champ has bragged about a $400 million purchase of 62 Manhattan apartment buildings. But in the month since his announcement, there's been no evidence of a sale.
    

2. CEO Larry Fink wants to build a new BlackRock. After decades of dominating the liquid markets, BlackRock is betting big on private markets. Fink wrote about the transformation in his annual letter to investors, saying the firm is focused on a ""$68 trillion boom"" in infrastructure.
    

3. Newsmax might be the newest Trump trade. The conservative media company soared more than 700% in its stock market debut, valuing Newsmax at about $8 billion. That's double the valuation of Trump Media and a third of Fox Corp.
    

1. YouTube is about to eclipse Disney as the biggest media company in the world. The company brought in $54.2 billion in revenue in 2024, according to MoffettNathanson analyst Michael Nathanson, which is only $5.5 billion behind Disney. But people still don't seem to understand how big YouTube really is, BI's Peter Kafka writes.
    

2. Elon Musk is spending millions on a supercomputer, but can he run it? xAI is spending at least $400 million on building the world's largest supercomputer in Memphis, Tennessee, according to documents viewed by BI. But it's short on the power needed to operate it.
    

3. Tumblr is Gen Z's newest safe space. Yes, millennials, you heard that right. Gen Zers, fed up with Musk and Zuckerberg, are reviving Tumblr dot com. How long they'll stay, however, is another question.
    

1. Tesla told salesworkers to ""stay vigilant"" in a video sent before last weekend's protests. The company described a ""dynamic environment"" in a clip sent to sales staff. It featured smiling employees, promo footage of Optimus and Robotaxi, and a dog — but no direct mention of the recent protests. One employee called it ""trivial"" and ""disappointing.""
    

2. To fix America's affordable housing problem, be more French. Paris' 19th-century redesign achieved both an unrivaled urban population density and a signature look for the city. Adopting Euro-style zoning can help US cities lower housing costs and look good doing it.
    

3. Don't be surprised to see Gucci ads on Fox News. Conservative media outlets say they're seeing an uptick in advertising from major brands. It's a sign advertisers now see avoiding right-leaning media as a risk — and it's also a 180 from the brand boycotts of Trump's first term.

It wasn’t too long ago that Donald Trump relished taking credit for moving the stock market. During his first term he routinely told supporters to check the gains on their 401Ks. The day before he took office, Trump told political supporters at a rally, “I don't want to say this—it's too braggadocious—but we'll say it anyway, the Trump effect. It's you. You're the effect. Since the election, the stock market has surged.” 
That’s changed. Since Trump took office, the stock market has faltered. The uncertainty around Trump’s vows to move forward with punishing tariffs on imports has rattled investors; the S&P 500 and Nasdaq just finished out their worst quarter since 2022. And new polling shows that Americans are losing faith in how Trump is handling the economy.

But Trump’s not backing down. On Wednesday, he’s expected to announce sweeping across-the-board tariffs on imported goods during a Rose Garden ceremony that he’s promoting as “Liberation Day” and the “rebirth of our country.” 
While Trump has promised that his new tariffs will pressure companies to open more factories inside the U.S. and lead to better trade deals with other countries, prominent economists and researchers for banks predict the new tariffs will lead to fewer jobs, a higher unemployment rate, and a drop in the U.S. gross domestic product.  In mid-March, JPMorgan Chase lowered its prediction for GDP growth because of the uncertainty around Trump’s trade policy. Real GDP growth of the U.S. economy would be 1.6% in 2025, J.P. Morgan Research predicted, down 0.3% from its previous estimates.
Part of the volatility in the stock market has been a response to the unpredictability of Trump’s stop-and-start tariff actions over the past few weeks. While announcing and then cancelling some tariffs, he has managed to impose a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports and a similar tariff on auto imports. Trump has telegraphed that his tariff announcement Wednesday would be broad and sweeping, with few exceptions. “You’d start with all countries,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday.  
Trump has acknowledged that Americans need to brace themselves for some economic pain. During Trump’s address to Congress in March, he said, “There will be a little disturbance. But we’re OK with that. It won’t be much.” A few days later, speaking with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News, Trump called the impact of his tariffs, “a little disruption.” “Look, what I have to do is build a strong country. You can't really watch the stock market,” Trump said.
Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday was asked what Trump has to say to Americans who rely on their retirement accounts and have concerns about the fluctuations in the stock market.  “Well, certainly they are legitimate concerns, and the president takes those concerns very seriously, and he’s addressing them every single day,” Leavitt said.
Recent polling has shown that an increasing number of Americans are worried about the impact Trump’s actions are having on the U.S. economy. A Fox News poll conducted in mid-March found that 53% of voters thought tariffs harm the U.S. economy and 28% believed they help.  The poll also found 69% of voters think tariffs make products more expensive, a view shared by mainstream economists. An AP-NORC pool conducted at the end of March found that 60% of US adults disapprove of Trump’s handling of trade negotiations. 
As Trump’s rolled out his economic plans, fewer and fewer Americans think his ideas will help them financially, according to a CBS News/YouGov poll. At the end of March, that poll found that 23% of Americans thought Trump’s policies would make them financially better off, a drop from 42% in January.
The next several months will be a test for Trump’s theory that increasing tariffs will ultimately strengthen the American economy. “There is substantial disagreement about the effect of tariffs between most economists and some key people in the White House,” says Whit Ayres, a long-time Republican strategist and pollster. “We’re gonna end up finding out who’s right.”

Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Michael Dell have fallen out of the exclusive $100 billion club after a terrible three months for the stock market.

        At the start of the year, there were 16 centi-billionaires but there are now only 13, as a sharp sell-off in equities wiped billions from their fortunes in the worst quarter for the market since 2022.
    

        The other casualty is Amancio Ortega, the founder of Zara owner Inditex.
    

        President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff policies have led to a more volatile market and dampened investor confidence.
    

        Once one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI stock boom, Huang is down $19.2 billion this year as Nvidia shares have fallen 18% since January. His net worth now stands at $95.2 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, putting him in 16th place.
    

        A mix of AI market saturation fears, tighter regulations, and a disappointing IPO from AI cloud startup CoreWeave have weighed on investor sentiment, dragging Nvidia's market value down.
    

        Huang remains richer than he was two years ago when his net worth was about $25 billion — although he's still well off his $130 billion peak from last November.
    

        Dell, the tech entrepreneur who has turned the company he founded, wasn't spared either.
    

        The Bloomberg rich list shows he's lost a big slice of his fortune in the first quarter of this year with a $24.5 billion decline. He's just below $100 billion mark and in 14th place.
    

        Despite reporting strong earnings in February, Dell Technologies' stock  has lost almost 22% this year amid concern slower-than-expected AI infrastructure spending.
    

        The 89-year-old Spanish founder of Zara is down $2.5 billion following a slide in Inditex shares of about 7% this year.
    

        That fall leaves him worth $98.8 billion and in 15th place on Bloomberg's list.
    

        A mix of weaker consumer spending and unfavorable foreign exchange conditions has taken its toll on the fast-fashion empire.
    

        Other members of the $100 billion club have taken heavy hits, with Elon Musk down $116 billion to $316 billion, Larry Ellison down $30.3 billion to $162 billion and Jeff Bezos down $27.1 billion to $212 billion.
    

        The only centi-billionaires to grow their wealth were Warren Buffett and Bill Gates.
    

        Buffett added $24.3 billion to his fortune this year following a surge in Berkshire Hathaway stock, putting him fifth on Bloomberg's list at $166 billion. 
    

        That's two spots and $5 billion ahead of his friend and Microsoft cofounder, whose net worth is $2 billion higher this year. The bulk of Gates' wealth comes from his cash holdings of $78 billion, with his Microsoft stake valued at $24.3 billion.

6,2025-04-01,"The Edge 60 Fusion is available now in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
The Edge 60 Fusion is available now in Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
by  Dominic Preston
Motorola announced the first phone in its midrange Edge 60 series, which ships with a novel twist: a faux-canvas finish. The Edge 60 Fusion looks the part otherwise, with its molded camera module and surprisingly slim body, but the basic specs match the low price tag — just £299.99 (around $390) in the UK.
The canvas-effect finish might be one of the phone’s main draws, but it’s only available on the “amazonite” (read: teal) version of the phone. It’s also launching in blue and pink colors, but these use a faux leather finish instead. Every version has IP68 and 69 ratings, meaning the phone is fully protected against dust, immersion in water, and high-pressure sprays.
There’s some international variation in the Edge 60 Fusion’s specs, but the model launching in the UK is slim for its size, at less than 8mm thick, despite fitting in a fairly large 5,200mAh battery behind its 6.67-inch OLED screen. Models elsewhere pack an even bigger 5,500mAh cell, but run a touch thicker.
The Fusion comes with up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, but is likely to be held back by the relatively basic MediaTek Dimensity chipset used — either a 7300 or 7400, depending on the market, but there’s not much difference between them. Cameras are limited too — it may look like four on the back, but one is the flash and another a flicker sensor, so you only really get a 50 megapixel main lens and a 13 megapixel ultrawide.
The Fusion is expected to be the first in a series of Edge 60 phones — there were five models across last year’s Edge 50 line. None of those launched in the US, and this year’s phones likely won’t either, so American buyers will have to make do with January’s $299.99 Moto G Power, which lacks the Fusion’s OLED display and canvas feel, but has wireless charging. Motorola is expected to announce its updated Razr flip phones soon, with rumors predicting a wooden finish, in a throwback to 2014’s wood-backed Moto X.

7,2025-04-01,"It’s the end of the world as we know it, but investors seem to feel (mostly) fine, judging by the stock market.
Stocks closed mainly higher on Tuesday ahead of an announcement by Donald Trump on Wednesday in which he may unveil immediate tariffs on almost all U.S. trading partners. The S&P 500 ended 0.4% higher, the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.9%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 11.8 points.
This muted performance came even as the ISM manufacturing index for March came at 49.0 — below expectations and indicating a contraction — with its forward-looking elements pointing to even deeper pessimism, Goldman Sachs (GS) said. The JOLTS job opening number also fell by more than expected.
Many investors are anticipating that Trump’s press conference will resolve many of the questions surrounding increased import taxes. While markets hate uncertainty, they tend to rally after it’s been resolved, LPL Financial’s (LPLA) strategists wrote in a report.
“There will still be trade policy uncertainty after that date, but the Trump administration is expected to clear up some of the biggest questions investors have right now,” they wrote. “We don’t want to sound too bullish, and we remain cautiously neutral right now, but the opportunity for upside is there.”
But the Trump administration’s track record  gives little reason to believe that April 2 will mark the end to ambiguity on trade, Michael Madowitz, the Roosevelt Institute’s principal economist, told Quartz. Even clarity wouldn’t prevent “scary” escalation scenarios — which Trump makes more likely with his confrontational stance.
There’s also the larger question as to whether Trump’s big increases in tariffs are purely a negotiating tactic — a view many investors and observers still seem to hold — or are part of a permanent, ideologically driven shift toward protectionism and away from 80 years of a U.S. push for freer trade. 
A major, long-term push to make most U.S. production domestic would take years and involve the deliberate infliction of economic pain, Chris Grisanti, MAI Capital Management’s chief market strategist, told Quartz last month. Costs would jump and stay high for an extended period.
“This is taking on a big structural problem, but the question is whether the cure is worse than the disease,” he said. And with many goods now so complicated, with parts sourced worldwide, seeking to move output 100% onshore would be like “unscrambling eggs.”
Trump’s push away from U.S. foreign policies in place for decades will have long-term economic consequences that may simply be too large for investors to absorb, said Marta Norton, Empower’s chief investment strategist. 
“Even if the tariffs are not as severe as painted, it’s still a sea change,” Norton said. “People have a hard time realizing that this a possibility given the state of play for the past couple of decades. It’s so immense that it’s hard to imagine.” However, there’s still a chance the duties will be tactical, she added.

                People walk through a building in Yiwu International Trade City, a massive wholesale market in Yiwu, China, where millions of Chinese-made items are sold.

Almost any American store or home has goods in it made in China, but I never thought I could visit a single place where much of it is sold.
Yiwu International Trade City, a giant wholesale market in Yiwu, China, is the clearinghouse for millions of Chinese-made items.
The market does not generally handle high-end products like Apple iPhones. Rather, it is the source of stuff you find for sale beside the checkout counter in an American store, or in the drawers of your home — such as hairpins, stuffed animals, plastic toys, pots and pans, light bulbs, umbrellas, hammers and press-on nails.
All these products are made by factories in the region, shipped to Yiwu, and soon shipped onward to countries around the world.
The Yiwu market was worth exploring for its own sake, and gave us some insight into the various ways that China's businesspeople are adjusting to U.S. tariffs. You can listen to our experience at the button above and read on below to meet four of the people our team encountered.

                Wang Xiao Nan, left, stands with her mother, Wang Nan, who owns a wholesale hardware shop in one of the market's buildings.

Wang Nan operates a wholesale shop high in one of the buildings of the market. The products on the wall include spades, saws, caulk guns, garden shears, bolt cutters, garden hose nozzles, drill bits, levels — essentially anything made of metal that you'd find in a hardware store.
""I came to Yiwu in 2000,"" she said. ""After I saw all kinds of goods that I had never seen before, I didn't want to leave.""
She started in printing, but her relatives manufacture hardware, and she became their distributor with a global business. While we visited, two men from Senegal came in to place an order. Many of their products go to a company in suburban New York City.
A post shared by NPR (@npr)
She wants to pass the business to her 25-year-old daughter, Wang Xiao Nan, or ""Little Nan,"" who has traveled to Texas and elsewhere to attend trade fairs or meet potential clients.
The mother quoted China's Chairman Mao, who said that women hold up ""half the sky."" She said in Yiwu, women hold up ""most of the sky.""
The company aspires to sell even more tools in the U.S., even as tariffs take hold. Wang Nan told us that American customers always need tools, and they'll just pay a little more. She is aiming to improve the packaging but not to lower her prices.

                Zixin Li, known online as Luna, is a TikTok influencer who documents the Yiwu market.

Retailers who can't visit the Yiwu market may discover it online through TikTok influencers who work here. One is Zixin Li, known online as Luna.
Like a lot of people in Yiwu, she's doing what she can to make a buck.
""Previously I did events planning, luxury events, in Shanghai, but you just earn too little,"" she said. So she decided to explore ""the land of opportunity,"" which is how she describes the Yiwu market.

                Nicole Zhang sells hair accessories at her storefront in the market.

Nicole Zhang sells hairpins and claw clips. She and her husband started the business in 2011. And as with many people in this market, the modest storefront with its inexpensive products does not indicate the scale of their enterprise. Out in the countryside they have a warehouse filled with more stuff, and beyond that a factory that they own.
Zhang says Target asked her to share half the cost of the tariffs — which the U.S. first set at 10%, and then 20.
She tried to negotiate: ""I said maybe 2 or 3% we can share from our profit,"" she said.

                Zeng Hao owns a business that makes 3-D-printed plastic toys.

We drove to one of the factories surrounding Yiwu—a business on the upper floor of an industrial building about an hour's drive away. There we met the owner, Zeng Hao, 33.
Just last year he was trying to make his fortune in cryptocurrency. Then he started a new business, buying some 3-D printers, a common consumer model of the sort that anyone can buy on Amazon and operate at home.
He jammed 20 such printers into his apartment and began producing plastic toys. He used the profits to buy more printers, and then more — as if they were replicating.

                Zeng Hao said 4,000 3D printers operate constantly to produce plastic toys.
                
                    
                    Steve Inskeep/NPR
                    
                
hide caption

When we visited his factory, Zeng Hao said 4,000 printers were operating 24 hours a day, seven days per week.
A small number of human workers operate the machines. And in some cases, they decorate the toys — putting eyes on plastic animals, giving them a ""soul,"" Zeng said.

He says one of his American clients asked him to pick up half the cost of the new U.S. tariffs. He agreed — but he said it doesn't matter much. Because even with the extra cost, he is raising his prices.

The Chinese EV maker BYD is piling the pain on Tesla.

        It has reported soaring sales and revenue even as Tesla has been battered by plunging sales in China, a diving stock price, and public backlash against CEO Elon Musk's work for the DOGE office.
    

        As BYD and Tesla square off, here are five charts showing how the two companies compare.
    

        BYD's overall vehicle sales dwarfed Tesla's last year.
    

        The Warren Buffett-backed electric vehicle giant sold 4.27 million vehicles in 2024, compared with Tesla's 1.78 million.
    

        The caveat is that BYD, unlike Tesla, sells hybrids as well as EVs. The Chinese firm sold 1.76 million battery-electric vehicles in 2024, meaning it fell just short of Tesla's EV-sales crown.
    

        Tesla will face a fight to retain its status as the world's largest EV maker this year, with sales plunging across the globe in the first few months of the year as BYD has surged.
    

        Last week, BYD reported blowout full-year earnings, with revenues overtaking Tesla's for the first time since 2018.
    

        The Chinese EV giant reported 2024 annual revenues of 777 billion yuan, or about $107 billion, a nearly 30% rise from the previous year.
    

        That means BYD leapfrogged Tesla's 2024 annual revenue, which came in at $97.7 billion.
    

        BYD's profits also surged in 2024. The automaker said Monday that its net profit jumped 34% year over year to just over 40 billion yuan.
    

        That still leaves it behind Tesla, with Musk's company booking a $7.1 billion net profit in 2024.
    

        One thing that sets Tesla and BYD apart from legacy automakers is that they both make much more than cars.
    

        The two companies have their own side hustles, with about 21% of Tesla's revenue last year coming from its energy-generation and services businesses.
    

        In addition to offering its Megapack and Powerwall battery systems, Tesla sells regulatory credits to rivals that have failed to sell enough EVs to meet government quotas.
    

        BYD, meanwhile, has a lucrative side business assembling and building components for smartphones, including Apple's iPhone.
    

        The Chinese company, which began its life making phone batteries, said one-fifth of its revenue last year came from ""mobile handset components, assembly service and other products.""
    

        Tesla's share price fall since the start of the year has been one for the history books.
    

        Investor concerns over Musk's work at DOGE and some alarming sales figures have seen the automaker's stock slump 30% this year, despite a recent resurgence following Musk's late-night all-hands in March.
    

        By contrast, BYD's stock has surged in 2025, and it hit a record high in March after it announced fast chargers it said could juice up an electric car in five minutes.
    

        Tesla stock fell 5% that day as BYD announced its ""Super e-Platform.""

14,2025-04-01,"Metaâs next step on its quest to reign over the burgeoning market for AR glasses may demand a hefty chunk of your wallet. The Mark Zuckerberg-led company is reportedly planning for new glasses, codenamed âHypernova,â that could cost well over $1,000 for the sake of a tiny heads-up-display built into one lens. Yes, that’s expensive, but Metaâs real struggle will be making sure it runs on software that doesnât make us want to throw its expensive glasses off a cliff.
The rumored Hypernova augmented reality glasses should arrive sometime this year, according to a Tuesday report from Bloombergâs Mark Gurman based on anonymous sources. The first iteration of Metaâs glasses with screens will include a minuscule monocular panel in the right-hand lens. This could offer users notifications from their phone or access to photos, or even check out directions from an app like Google Maps. For that privilege, prospective owners will need to cough up at least $1,000, according to Gurman. Some versions may cost upwards of $1,300 or $1,400.
Meta could debut those glasses this year, likely at its annual Meta Connect conference. This model may also see a larger sensor that should shoot higher-quality photos than the 12 MP camera sensor on the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.
Otherwise, the Hypernova will mirror the design of Metaâs past work. Current Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses start at $300, though versions with transition lenses cost closer to $380. These glasses use physical button controls to access the built-in camera for photos or videos. The glassesâ best feature is the on-board speakers, which users can control by sliding their finger along a capacitive sensor on the right ear piece. Gurman mentioned the Hypernova glassesâ physical controls may work the same way as the Ray-Bans.
The Ray-Ban Meta glasses do the job if all you want to do is snap quick pics of your dog or listen to your tunes without headphones. The main issue for any future Meta wearable will be software. Bloomberg noted Hypernova will boot onto its own home screen where users will have access to an app drawer of horizontal icons. There could be a dedicated apps for pictures, camera, and maps.
Gurman said the glasses “will continue rely heavily” on the Meta View app. You use that app with the Ray-Bans for moving photos from your glasses to your phone. Itâs not a particularly easy app to use, and the many mentions of the new glasses containing the ability to deliver notifications, presumably from your phone, have me a little nervous.
Software has always been Meta’s Achilles’ heel. It’s a web-based company in a world where the phone makers decide who can do what. The Meta View app is severely limited by the operating systems it operates on, and Mark Zuckerberg hasn’t been shy complaining about how the Ray-Ban Meta and other third party hardware works with iOS. If these new glasses are stuck in a similar ecosystem then it will be hard for them to not end up like the the many smartglasses that have come before.
Recent leaks from inside Meta suggest the company has plans to launch multiple types of smart glasses this year. (One of those could be a pair of Oakley-branded visors made for athletes.) But this strategy will continue to struggle when the glasses are being used as an interface for a phone made by another company. Unless Zuckerberg and company know something we don’t, these new glasses might lead to more frustration than wonder.

Doubt lurks around every corner, and to have a reliable way of keeping an eye open is not only a precaution—a necessity. This is where this Braload mini (hidden) 4K HD camera comes in as it offers a robust solution for peace of mind during uncertain times.
Being the #1 best-seller among Amazon hidden cameras, this product has attracted attention from thousands and over 10,000 units have been sold just in the past month alone. At the discounted price of only $34—a staggering 17% discount from its original price of $41—this tiny titan of a camera is making big waves in the home security market.
See at Amazon
Its main selling point, though, is its ability to offer crystal-clear 4K Ultra HD resolution which renders all the details with accuracy. Day or night, no problem—the video remains sharp and clear. The night vision mode of the camera enhances its performance as it takes clear pictures in complete darkness. This is extremely useful for monitoring places like nurseries, corridors, or storage rooms where there might not be much light.
This Braload camera also excels in motion detection: Equipped with smart sensors, it can detect movement and send real-time alerts to your smartphone automatically via its user-friendly app. This keeps you aware of what is happening in your home or office even when you are not around. The app also has live streaming capabilities, allowing you to have a real-time view of the camera feed anywhere in the world. For added convenience, the device has both cloud storage and local SD card storage support, so you can use the one that best fits your needs.
One of the significant aspects of this camera is its 1500mAh rechargeable battery, which provides a maximum of four hours of continuous recording on a single charge. This long battery life makes it ideal for applications where continuous surveillance is a requirement. The camera also has the ability to function without Wi-Fi if required.
Despite its technological prowess, this camera is still extremely discreet: Due to its compact size (1.38×1,8×0,55 inches), it can be concealed anywhere whether it is stuck behind a bookshelf, installed on the wall or hidden in a corner of the room. This makes it a great choice if you need efficient surveillance without drawing attention to the equipment itself.
It’s suitable for keeping an eye on pets while you’re at work, ensuring your baby is safe in their crib, or monitoring nannies and caregivers discreetly. It’s also a great tool for enhancing home security by capturing potential intruders or suspicious activity around your property.
At just $34, this camera is a steal at its price: It loads all the latest features like 4K resolution, motion detection, night vision, and long battery life into a compact package that’s easy to use and very effective. Being Amazon’s #1 best-seller in spy cameras, it’s no surprise that this product has become a must-have gadget for today’s surveillance needs.

The AI model races are heating up. Right on the heels of DeepSeek-R1’s release, the industry is reeling from yet another powerful AI model hitting the market. I test drove the latest iteration of Alibaba’s Qwen models — Qwen 2.5.
In this post, I’ll break down what Qwen 2.5 is, how you can use it, and how it compares to OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-RI. I’ll also explore what this means for the AI industry moving forward. Let’s dive in.

Qwen 2.5 was released as a surprise launch on January 29, 2025. Like its competitors, Qwen 2.5 offers natural language processing, versatile use cases, and integrations with multilingual support. It’s fast and trained on a massive amount of data. It can search the web, write text, and code.
Unlike OpenAI and Claude’s models, Qwen 2.5 is open source, which opens a realm of possibility for companies and developers.
Beyond that, you can go to Qwen’s website and sign up to start using it today for free. Early testing suggests that Qwen 2.5 performs similarly to ChatGPT’s o1 and o3 models, which cost $200 per month. For a company or an individual looking to leverage complex reasoning and build a custom AI model, that’s significant savings.
Qwen 2.5 is also multimodal, meaning it can process and generate content based on both text and image inputs. This approach makes the tool incredibly versatile. With Qwen 2.5, I can:
Take a look at this performance comparison of Qwen 2.5 versus the other leading models, including ChatGPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, DeepSeek-V3, and Llama-3.1.

Qwen outperforms all other models on Arena-Hard (complex problem-solving) and LiveBench (competence in real-world AI tasks). Other tests have found that the...

In a world dominated by smartphones, disposable cameras might seem like a relic of the past. But thereâs something undeniably charming about the simplicity of snapping photos with a one-time-use camera, especially when itâs as reliable and fun as the Fujifilm QuickSnap Flash 400. Right now, this two-pack is available on Amazon for just $23 which is a 12% discount off its original price of $26.
See at Amazon
Packed with Fujicolor Superia X-TRA 400 film, this Fujifilm camera offers high-quality, sharp photos in a variety of lighting conditions. From an outdoor wedding on a sunny day to indoor situations with its built-in flash, this camera offers sharp and vibrant photos. The flash has an effective maximum range of 10 feet and is best used in low light, and its recharging feature allows you to just focus on your composition without worrying about technicalities.
This camera can be taken around with ease: At a compact 115 x 54 x 34 mm and only 90 grams, it fits comfortably in your pocket or bag, ready to accompany you on any adventure. Its fixed focus lens and wide-angle construction allow you to shoot easily, regardless of your skill levelâpoint and shoot! The inverted Galilean-type viewfinder provides you with a clear frame in which to compose your shots, so every instant is recorded accurately.
One of the most impressive things about this disposable camera is how well it can adapt to different environments: Outdoors, it performs best in sunny or lightly overcast weather, but indoors, the flash comes on to light up your subjects. Whether family reunions or spontaneous road trips, the QuickSnap Flash 400 can adapt to any situation. Plus, with 27 exposures per camera (54 total in the two-pack), youâll have plenty of opportunities to document your memories.
Beyond its use, the camera also offers a retro look that cannot be replicated with digital cameras. Anticipating your film to develop, wondering how your pictures turned outâan aura of suspense that makes each roll special. Fujifilm even has a recycling program for the camera, minimizing their use of resources after consumption.
Why not try a digital screen break and re-experience the joys of film photography?

20,2025-04-01,"Elon Musk lack of focus may be catching up to him. Beyond Tesla losing its lead to China’s BYD in the electric vehicle market, it appears that his ambitious project to implant computer chips in human brains may similarly be falling behind competitors. According to Reuters, a Chinese tech company has implanted similar chips in three patients with a plan to install ten more the end of 2025; Elon Musk’s Neuralink has to-date installed chips in three patients.
Projects to create brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, have been in the works since at least the early 2010s. The technology has already demonstrated its usefulness in people with disabilities, like spinal cord injuries, where BCIs can allow one with limited mobility to control a computer with their mind. The chips essentially work by monitoring electrical signals in the brain for patterns associated with different actions, translating them into computer code.
The leading BCI project in China is a collaboration between the Chinese Institute for Brain Research (CIBR) and NeuCyber NeuroTech. Beinao No.1 is the group’s semi-invasive chip that has already been demonstrated in use with patients. In a video released last year, patients suffering from paralysis were shown controlling a robotic arm to pour a cup of water, with their thoughts transmitted onto a computer screen. The company hopes to conduct formal trials with 50 patients by 2026.
Founded in 2016, Musk’s Neuralink had been quiet for years, but in 2024 came out of the shadows and shared the story of its first patient with a successful implant. Noland Arbaugh, a quadriplegic paralyzed from the shoulders down, reported that Neuralink’s chip enabled him to begin using his computer and playing games independently. Unlike semi-invasive chips that are placed on the brain’s surface, Neuralink inserts them inside the brain to maximize signal. It is more risky, but could offer better performance.
Last year, China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology expressed its interest in advancing BCI technology, saying it aims to âmake breakthroughs in key technologies and core devices such as brain-computer fusion, brain-like chips, and brain-computing neural models.” The ministry noted the technology could be used in applications including hands-free driving, virtual reality, and medical rehabilitation. This being China, there are no doubt concerns regarding how the state may use data collected from a BCI. Maybe one’s social credit score will drop if they have thoughts not conducive to the stability of the authoritarian regime.
Neuralink likely does not have to worry too much about Chinese competitors due to such concerns. In the United States, however, a company called Synchron is also working on the technology with backers including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Microsoft’s Bill Gates. The company has trialed its technology on ten patients thus far.
Musk was famous for bringing electric cars into the mainstream and has been able to quickly build a formidable AI company in xAI despite launching the endeavor years after the competition. Being behind does not necessarily mean Neuralink will lose. The company’s invasive implementation is different from the rest, and Musk’s greater ambition with Neuralink is to create new forms of cybernetic âenhancementsâ for everyday people. Maybe individuals could someday have super-human memory, or the ability to learn new skills instantly. xAI’s artificial intelligence capabilities could theoretically support Neuralink.
Musk also could benefit from his close ties to President Trump and his DOGE initiative, which has led to layoffs across the federal government, including at the Centers for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration, agencies which had slowed Neuralink’s progress with regulatory reviews.
China has been aggressive about supporting the country’s foray into new industries like electric cars, and BCIs are no different. Earlier in March, the country’s Nation Healthcare Security Administration announced healthcare billing categories for implants of brain-computer interface chips. When a top-down, centralized economy like China decides to prioritize specific endeavors, it can make advances quickly. BYD now outsells Tesla globally with factories opening across the world. The risk is that China overtakes the United States in key industries and is able to spread its values and influence around the world.
There remain a lot of concerns surrounding BCIs, particularly the invasive version that Neuralink uses. Long-term compatibility and post-operative immune reactions are still a question. Semi-invasive versions are safer but struggle with weaker signals to the brain.

Beer, famously good for your hair, so why not for your face too? Well, Heineken’s Smootheriser makes the case that beer for the belly is good enough for the hair, and can be great for the face too. Developed in-house and launching in Taiwan and Cambodia, the Smootheriser uses the same quality hops and barley as its alcoholic counterpart – but instead of working your liver, it hydrates your skin.
What first started as an April Fool’s Joke actually spun off into a full-fledged product development exercise. I’m not kidding – Heineken’s own press release says “This isn’t an April Fool’s Joke.” The Heineken® Smootheriser will launch in Cambodia and Taiwan, coinciding with the beverage company’s marketing of Heineken Silver – its premium beer offering. I guess (facial) beauty really is in the eyes of the beer holder.
Designer: Heineken






It’s not entirely clear if the skin cream will be a limited-edition offering or something Heineken will develop continually for the near future – but the cream is a way of drawing attention to Heineken Silver – one of the company’s most popular beers. Brewed at -1°C for its signature crisp taste, Heineken Silver has a fairly large fan-base… and if the company can also get the same people to keep their skin looking flawlessly moisturized, I guess that’s a win for everyone. The launch in Asia hopes to tap into the massive skincare-enthusiast market in the region, providing a premium product made using the same high-quality ingredients as their beer.

Heineken obviously gets the fact that announcing this on the first of April comes with its level of extra skepticism. I went through the press release multiple times too – but I guess you have to take a company on its word when it does specify it in a press release. After all, sometimes jokes can have a pretty adverse impact on a company’s valuation in the stock market – remember Volkswagen teasing that they were rebranding to Voltswagen?
The Smootheriser, arguably, feels much better-planned. It’s sure to make people laugh, then become actually curious, and hopefully relent. Maybe Heineken should launch a beer-flavored Lip Gloss next?!

23,2025-04-01,"Newsmax is now more valuable than Fox Corp. after shares of the right-wing media company skyrocketed again on Tuesday, a market shift that nearly tripled the company’s market cap after a massive debut Monday.
Trading of the right-wing news outlet’s stock was halted multiple times for volatility early ... More Tuesday.
Newsmax surged 180% to end Tuesday trading at $234, after opening the day at $83.51.
The market shift increased Newsmax’s market cap to just below $30 billion from $10.7 billion on Monday, a valuation that surpasses Fox’s market cap of about $23.4 billion after shares for the company declined slightly (1.7%) on Tuesday.
Trading in Newsmax’s stock was briefly halted five times for volatility on Tuesday, including five-minute pauses that started at 2:17 p.m., 1:54 p.m., 10:06 a.m., 10:22 a.m. and 10:34 a.m., according to Nasdaq.
Newmax debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday as shares surged over 700% during its first day of trading, though trading in the stock was halted a dozen times for volatility.

$9.2 billion. That’s the estimated value of Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy’s 31% stake in the company as of Tuesday’s closing price. While Newsmax surpassed Fox’s market cap, Ruddy’s fortune likely still trails that of Rupert Murdoch, as the former Fox Corp. chairman has an estimated net worth of $22.5 billion.
Newsmax’s success appears to suggest there are more conservative investors than previously expected, Andersen Capital Management founder Peter Andersen told Reuters. Andersen said it’s “probably a perfect time” for Newsmax’s IPO, “simply because of all the volatility in the political arena currently.” Ruddy forecast the company’s successful debut in a statement to CNBC, suggesting consumers are paying more to watch channels from other networks as Newsmax’s fees for TV distributors to carry its network have increased in recent years.
Newsmax’s market cap exceeds valuations for The New York Times Company and CBS parent Paramount, which have $8.1 billion and $7.9 billion caps, respectively, as of Tuesday. The company is also more valuable than media companies Tegna and Sinclair, which together own nearly 250 local television stations, combined, with valuations of $2.9 billion and $1 billion, respectively. Right-wing media companies like Truth Social parent Trump Media and Technology Group and the video-sharing platform Rumble had similar initial public offerings. Trump Media shares surged 56% to $78 in their debut, which also featured several halts for volatility. The stock has remained largely volatile, surging to above $40 in January after dropping below $14 in September, as shares appeared to be linked to President Donald Trump’s election campaign. Rumble’s shares floated between $5 and $7 for most of 2024 before setting an all-time high $15.23 at year’s end.
As Newsmax’s shares continue to soar in value, a jury trial is scheduled to begin April 28 for claims brought against the company by Dominion Voting Systems. Dominion, which accused Newsmax of pushing false claims about widespread election fraud on Dominion’s voting machines after the 2020 presidential election, is seeking about $1.6 billion in damages, according to CNN. The company will also need to pay off the remainder of a $40 million settlement with Smartmatic, which made similar allegations. Newsmax is scheduled to pay Smartmatic another $20 million in July, according to court documents.
Newsmax raised about $75 million in its IPO while selling 7.5 million shares for $10 each. The company debuted with a market cap of about $1.2 billion, CEO Christopher Ruddy told CNBC, who suggested Newsmax would be a “growth stock,” later saying, “Americans for a long time have been voting with their remote controls, downloads, apps to say they want Newsmax.” The debut for Newsmax made Ruddy, who owns about 31% of the company, a billionaire, Forbes reported.

        With Tesla underperforming in both the stock market and the public eye, some competitors are eyeing a gap in the market.
    "
25,2025-04-01,"
Dutch architecture studio MVRDV has introduced its vision for Market Cube, a versatile marketplace made up of stacked volumes in Zhubei, Taiwan. This innovative design by MVRDV reimagines the traditional market square, featuring a tiered structure intended to offer flexibility and adapt to future shifts in market-building typology. “With its stack of open, flexible floors that can adapt to changing demands, the building acts as an urban condenser and is envisaged as the next step in the evolution of the market,” the studio said. “This future-focused vision is reflected in its name: the market square becomes the Market Cube.”
Designer: MVRDV







The Market Cube will span eight floors and cover 18,962 square meters, featuring two levels dedicated to market space and food courts, as well as exhibition areas, a daycare and children’s center, and a rooftop performance venue. Multi-level underground parking will also be included. The building’s design allows each level to be independently opened to the exterior or closed off, enabling some areas to remain accessible at night.
Visualizations of the proposal show expansive external terraces that function as walkways on each level, accessed via two sets of escalators encased in translucent panels. On the first floor, a pedestrian bridge will connect over the adjacent road, providing direct access from the nearby park to the food court. The market spaces on the ground and lower levels will extend into the surrounding streets, integrating the building with its urban environment.







Inside Market Cube, a diverse array of vendors will be accommodated, ranging from traditional market stalls offering local goods and produce to modern kiosks equipped with built-in seating areas for a more relaxed shopping or dining experience. The interiors are thoughtfully designed with spacious, flexible layouts that can be easily adapted to suit “any alternative use imaginable,” ensuring that the space can evolve with changing needs and trends. High ceilings further enhance the sense of openness, allowing for creative installations or temporary exhibits that can transform the space as needed.
To facilitate easy navigation throughout the Market Cube, each level will be illuminated with a distinct color scheme, which will add visual interest and also serve as a guide to the building’s various functions. This color-coding system is designed to intuitively communicate the purpose of each area to visitors, enhancing their overall experience. Strategically placed LED screens will provide information and updates, while neon lights contribute a modern, vibrant aesthetic. Together, these elements create an engaging and dynamic environment that reflects the innovative spirit of the Market Cube.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Laptops are expected to go up in price in the coming weeks due to tariffs and tensions, and I recommend that anyone in need of a new PC start shopping now before things potentially get out of hand.
Perfect timing? I have an awesome deal to share if you're interested in spending budget money on a solid mid-range convertible laptop.
Lenovo's Yoga 7 2-in-1, released in 2024, is down to $449.99 at Best Buy for a limited time. That's $300 off the regular price for a laptop with AI smarts and versatile design.
Lenovo Yoga 7 2-in-1 14"" (2024)Was: $749.99Now: $449.99 at Best Buy
""The Lenovo Yoga 7 (2024, AMD) makes for a great 2-in-1 laptop thanks to its solid performance, AI-boosting processor, versatile design, great battery life, and low price point. Support for Windows Hello and a fingerprint reader also make it more convenient to use.""
Windows Central review:⭐⭐⭐⭐
Display: 14 inches, 1920x1200, 60Hz, 300 nits, touch. CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 8640HS. GPU: AMD Radeon (integrated). RAM: 8GB LPDDR5. Storage: 512GB M.2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD. AI PC: Yes. Copilot+ PC: No.
👉 See at: BestBuy.com
💰 Price check: From $450 at Lenovo (Pick up at Best Buy)

Lenovo's Yoga 7 2-in-1 is a convertible laptop with 360-degree hinges, allowing for tent, stand, and tablet modes when you aren't using it as a notebook.
Windows Central Editor Rebecca Spear reviewed the Yoga 7 2-in-1 (2024) favorably, handing it a Recommended Award in the process thanks to its overall excellent value, strong performance, and sleek design.
Spear remarked in her review:
""The Lenovo Yoga 7 (2024) is a versatile little 2-in-1 AI laptop that can also be used as a tablet when needed. It offers great battery life that lasts for over 13 hours and provides several ports to meet your accessory or other connection needs. When it comes to performance, the laptop is a solid choice with a reliable AI-boosted AMD CPU that's supported by its AMD GPU. Considering everything on offer at this price point, it's a value buy.""
Considering it was already a value buy at full price, the current $300 discount at Best Buy is no small amount.
Spear calls out the laptop's professional look, wide port variety, and IR camera/fingerprint reader for Windows Hello security as high points in terms of design.
But it's not all looks; performance is also quite good. Spear tested the Ryzen 7 model, so expect slightly lower numbers from the Ryzen 5 that's included in the discounted model.
This is technically an AI PC thanks to the Ryzen chip's Neural Processing Unit (NPU), although it hits a 16 TOPS ceiling that bars it from Copilot+ tools in Windows 11.
Battery life is respectable, with Spear seeing more than 13 hours of runtime from a charge.
As with any laptop under $750 (or, in this case, down to less than $500), there are some compromises to be made.
Spear discovered in her review that the 1920x1200 (FHD+) touch display's IPS panel doesn't produce impressive color reproduction, hitting 64% sRGB, 49% AdobeRGB, and 48% DCI-P3.
If you don't plan on handling work that requires an accurate color gamut (like photo editing), this matters less.

What might irk you more is the display's maximum 328 nits brightness. It's not any lower than the bulk of sub-$1,000 laptops, but it will pose problems if you intend to work outdoors.
Lenovo does list an OLED option that solves these issues, though it doesn't look like the upgraded display is readily available even at Lenovo's storefront.
Spear does mention that the screen's touch functionality is flawless, which is extra important in a convertible PC.
The Yoga 7 2-in-1 from 2024 isn't perfect, but at the current discounted price of $449.99, it's impossible not to recommend it to anyone who needs a new mid-range laptop at a budget price.

28,2025-04-01,"The tech market is experiencing significant price fluctuations from tariffs and tensions. Here's why you should buy now.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Anyone paying attention to tech prices in recent weeks has undoubtedly noticed a rise across many popular sectors.
The global market shakeup is largely caused by US President Trump's tariffs, which put a tax on select imported goods, and is being felt by many consumers, and there's unfortunately no end in sight.
Laptops are some of the first products to be affected, which begs the question: Should you buy a new laptop now?

Why you can trust Windows Central




Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.


Whether or not you should buy a new laptop now depends on a few factors.
Do you plan to upgrade or buy new in the next year or two? Yes, I recommend shopping now.
You likely have a few weeks, at most, before some prices really start to climb once retailers have cleared out stock that arrived before the tariffs were in place.
Acer's CEO and Chairman, Jason Chen, already announced a flat 10% price increase on its laptops to counteract the 10% tariff on Chinese imports enacted by President Trump, and prices from other brands seem to be creeping up much faster than usual.
Laptop update cycles follow CPU updates, and there isn't expected to be new performance hardware from Intel or AMD until 2026. If you buy a modern Intel or AMD PC now, you won't be surprised with an updated version in just a few weeks.
Qualcomm, however, is expected to unveil its new Snapdragon chips this year, and we'll likely see those laptops on sale by the holiday season. I'm also hoping to see new Surface PCs in Fall 2025.
If, on the other hand, you purchased a new laptop in the last year or two — laptops usually have a five-year lifespan, more if you baby your tech — you don't need to worry as much.
There's one exception: those who have AI computing ambitions should shop for a laptop with a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) capable of at least 40 TOPS of power to handle Copilot+ AI tools built into Windows 11.
Laptops with Qualcomm Snapdragon X chips, Intel Core Ultra Series 2 (excluding H and HX-series), and AMD Ryzen AI 300 chips hit that mark.

A report from the Consumer Technology Association's (CTA) one-year forecast for consumer technology, as reported by TechCrunch, is grim.
With a theoretical 10% or 20% tariff on all imports, as well as a 60% tariff on Chinese goods, the CTA saw laptop prices rise by 46%. Gaming consoles were next at 40%, and phones went up by 26%.
Putting that into perspective, even a 20% increase in laptop pricing would drive a $1,200 model, which roughly sits near the middle of the market, up to $1,440.
A 46% increase, as theorized by the CTA, would push the $1,200 model up to $1,752 and out of the price range of most consumers.
Of course, there's so far no 60% tariff on imports from China, although there is still the threat of a 25% tariff on processors coming into the US.
There's also President Trump's ""Liberation Day"" on April 2, 2025, which could bring any number of new tariffs and regulations. As Bloomberg reports, it's already causing stock markets to drop.
Trump's goal with the potential chip tariff is to force companies to move more manufacturing hubs to the United States, where Intel and TSMC already have ground. However, this return won't be felt anytime soon.
TechCrunch's report also mentions a presentation given by Brian Comiskey at CES 2025, in which he explained how AI-powered features are playing into the situation.
The rise of AI hardware in consumer laptops might not seem like a big deal to everyone, but the CTA foresees newfound demand for cutting-edge PCs that can handle tools like Copilot+.

The current laptop market is home to countless affordable and budget laptops, but they're not all made the same.
If you're looking for the best value possible, it's likely that you'll have to make some compromises. Reading laptop reviews is usually the best place to discover those compromises.
Want a great display, maybe with an OLED panel? Acer's Swift Edge 16, which I reviewed, is a prime example.
Acer is generally the go-to brand for affordable laptops, but in the case of the Swift Edge 16, its OLED display is the main selling point that pulls away from battery life and overall hardware build quality.
The other major laptop brands also have more affordable laptops available.
HP's ""Essential"" lineup of laptops is home to plenty of sub-$1,000 PCs, with prices dipping as low as $300 with discounts.
Dell's Inspiron and the rebranded ""Base"" laptops (expected to be arriving soon) are in the same category, offering many sub-$1,000 models.
For Lenovo, it's the IdeaPad brand that gets the most attention from value-conscious shoppers, and ASUS has its Vivobook series with competitive pricing.
If you're simply in search of the best possible hardware no matter the price, our guide to the best Windows laptops can help.
And if it's an AI PC you want, my guide to the best AI laptops has more great hardware to consider.
I'm curious to know if our readers are concerned with rising tech prices, and I'd like to know if you're considering buying a new laptop now to replace something that's starting to show its age.

 Forbes Staff. 
Global jitters, caused by the tariffs tsunami unleashed by President Donald Trump, took a toll on India’s stock markets, which corrected after last year’s stratospheric rise. Despite the dampener, the country churned out a record 205 billionaires on Forbes’ 2025 list of the World’s Billionaires—up from 200 last year. A weaker rupee, didn’t help: their combined wealth is $941 billion—down from $954 billion in 2024. The 10 richest Indians are worth nearly $337 billion, over a third of the total, down by a massive $56 billion from a year ago.
The bulk of that decline can be attributed to the falling fortunes of the richest and the second richest , who saw their combined wealth erode by $51 billion. Despite a one-fifth drop in his net worth to $92.5 billion, Mukesh Ambani retained his position as both the wealthiest Asian and India’s richest person-though he’s no longer a centibillionaire.
Shares of his Reliance Industries conglomerate lagged the market, falling 15% since the last list. That was partly due to weaker margins in the oil refining and petrochemicals businesses and competitive pressures facing its retailing unit, which he plans to eventually list. (Ambani’s Reliance owns Network18, which is a licensee of Forbes Media and publishes Forbes India.)
Infrastructure and commodities tycoon Gautam Adani registered the biggest dollar decline among Indian billionaires this year. His fortune fell by a third to $56.3 billion though he held on to his spot as India’s second wealthiest citizen. Shares of Adani companies tumbled in November when the U.S. Department of Justice indicted his group and its officials in a bribery case involving a solar project in India. The self-made billionaire’s group denied the allegations as baseless.
The composition of the ten richest Indians hasn’t changed from a year ago though there was some shuffle in the pecking order. India’s richest woman, Savitri Jindal, matriarch of the O.P. Jindal group, is now the third wealthiest Indian with a net worth of $35.5 billion, up from number four last year. Her Mumbai-based son Sajjan Jindal made an ambitious push into electric cars by acquiring a 35% stake in the Indian arm of MG Motor, a unit of China’s state-owned SAIC Motor.
Jindal is one of four among the ten richest to notch a wealth gain while the remaining half a dozen are all less well off. Tech tycoon Shiv Nadar, who recently transferred a chunk of his stake in flagship HCL Technologies to his only daughter Roshni Nadar Malhotra, slips to the position of fourth richest in India, with a net worth of $34.5 billion.
Overall, the wealth of 92 Indian billionaires was up from last year including Shiv Kishan Agrawal and Manohar Lal Agarwal, whose wealth, tied to Indian snack maker Haldiram Snacks Foods, more than doubled after Singapore’s Temasek acquired a stake valuing the firm at $10 billion. Madhusudan Agarwal from the same family is one of 17 new Indian billionaires this year.
Among the others making their debut are: Bhavish Aggarwal, the feisty founder and CEO of ride-hailing firm Ola Cabs, who took his Ola Electric, a maker of EV scooters and motorcycles public last August; Mahima Datla, who runs vaccine maker Biological E, in which she has a controlling stake; entrepreneur Ronnie Screwvala, the former head of Walt Disney in India, who deployed his media fortune — after selling out to Disney — in edtech; and garments exporter Harish Ahuja, whose Shahi Exports, a company started by his mother, supplies to brands such as H&M and Calvin Klein.
Three people returned to the list after previously falling off, including Satish Mehta, who founded and runs generics maker Emcure Pharmaceutical, which he listed last July. The market meltdown knocked down fourteen people from last year’s list, including Pradeep Rathod, chairman and managing director of Cello World, a household name in India for plastic products, from storage boxes to moulded furniture.

Caught you off guard; Nothing is announcing a brand new product reveal that'll give you a bit of nostalgia.
Today (Apr. 1), Nothing unveiled its latest audio product for its Ear lineup dubbed the Ear 3.5mm. If you've ever felt like you wanted to take a step back to wired earphones that deliver unparallel sound, this could be for you. The Nothing Ear 3.5mm features a jack for its respective port on your smartphone or other eligible device.
Additionally, the device is boasts Nothing's ""signature style"" for the in-ear part. Users will notice the company's expected transparent design, as well as a large hoop that's meant to go around your ear to ensure it remains in place. Amazingly, the Nothing Ear 3.5mm features a generous 50mm cable, which means you can get a load of housework done while staying connected.
Nothing ends its reveal with the tagline ""Uninterrupted, untangled, unbelievable freedom.""

Nothing didn't provide a market release date nor any information on pre-orders for the Ear 3.5mm —because this isn't a real product! April Fools! 
Aside from calling its latest product ""beautifully inconvenient,"" it might've seemed odd that Nothing would — out of nowhere — offer an incredibly lengthy cord attached to the base of its Ear Open.
If you're looking for some ""real"" earphones, Nothing's Ear Open buds launched last fall (don't worry, they're wireless) and flaunted a different approach to the earphone design. Nothing opted for an ""open"" approach to the earbuds, which feature a wide ear loop, designed to go over your ears, not inside. Despite that, Android Central's Tshaka Armstrong said in his review that the buds surprisingly feature quite a bit of bass.

In other news, the Nothing OS 3.1 update is rolling out for the Phone 3a and 3a Pro which adds a major feature to Essential Key. It now works with the camera app, letting users directly save photos to their Essential Space with written or voice notes.


Bass lovers rejoice!
Nothing has accomplished what other open earbuds haven't been able to and that's give you a robust, full frequency experience! For its full feature-set, including ChatGPT integration, and price point, you can't go wrong with Nothing's latest audio product.

Donald Trump has cut funding for clean energy projects and promised to ramp up fossil fuel extraction, but there are still job opportunities for graduates looking to work in climate tech. 

        The administration's executive orders to halt Biden-era funding for clean energy projects comes at a time when private investment in climate tech is slowing down. In the first quarter of 2024, climate and energy startups raised $20.42 billion in VC funding; as of Q1 in 2025, they're lagging behind in proportion, having raised $10 billion, PitchBook data shows.
    

        All signs point to less money flowing into the clean energy sector. For job seekers looking to break into the climate tech and clean energy sectors in Trump 2.0, thinking more creatively could be key to breaking into the field, according to investors, recruiters, and founders who spoke with Business Insider. 
    

        Carbon capture startup Carbo Culture takes waste biomass and converts it into biochar, a form of organic charcoal used in soil. 
    

        Its cofounder and CEO, Henrietta Moon, told BI that the umbrella of climate tech has expanded in the past decade beyond the energy transition. That means graduates can find opportunities at the intersection of sectors such as fashion, food, and even finance, she said. 
    

        ""We've seen how the first wave of renewables overshot every prediction in price performance time and time again, and now they are a part of our infrastructure to stay,"" Moon told BI.
    

        She said new climate technologies are needed to decarbonize the ""entire economy,"" whether it's food, materials, or finance.  
    

        ""There's plenty to do for new talent who want to roll up their sleeves and learn,"" Moon added. ""The know-how you harness from being part of building a growing industry in a growing market is universally applicable and extremely valuable.""
    

        Graduates don't have to immediately jump into a climate-focused role. They could start off by building key soft skills that enable them to land a more fulfilling role in the industry later down the line, said Emma Halls, director at Stem7 Executive Search, a recruitment firm. 
    

        ""Whatever area of climate tech graduates want to impact, they want to be thinking about what that first step is,"" Halls told BI. ""Because ideally, if they want to contribute and want to add value, they need an expertise and professional skill set behind them.""
    

        She added that picking up broader skills and transitioning into a climate role is ""what we often see.""
    

        The clean energy transition spans multiple sectors, creating ample opportunities for graduates in areas such as construction, engineering, or finance, said Juan Muldoon, partner at Energize Capital.
    

        ""Some of the largest renewable developers in the world are still growing, and they are still committed to delivering on a massive expansion of several projects,"" he told BI. 
    

        He added that graduates could target ""tried and true technologies, such as wind, solar, batteries, the things that are not relying on complex technological development cycles."" These are not as sensitive to subsidies because they're already economically competitive and at parity with traditional fossil fuels, Muldoon added. 
    

        He said taking a pragmatic approach is key for graduates because ""there are times and cycles when the technology is more in vogue.""
    

        ""Think about pockets of the industry that are still resilient, that still have growth, that still have the underlying, fundamental economic tailwinds of cost competitiveness and areas that are going to be less affected by the rhetoric,"" he added.
    

        Students who are graduating in a market that's pulling back on ESG spending should think strategically about entering climate tech.
    

        Iris Bardon, a business analyst at recycling startup Greyparrot who graduated in 2024, found that the best way to get her foot in the door was to harness how digital innovation could ""address tangible environmental and socio-economic challenges with precision and responsibility.""
    

        Broad, transferable skills, such as proficiency at interpreting complex datasets, stakeholder management, and strong communication and data analysis skills, ""stand out as the top three skills to land a job in this sector,"" she told BI.
    

        It's also worth preempting which sectors within climate tech will be more in demand in the coming years, said Clara Ricard, an investor at the climate fund Transition. The California wildfires, for example, put the spotlight on the need for technology that can predict and mitigate wildfires.
    

        ""In the West Coast in the US, climate risk is a growing concern,"" Ricard told BI. ""Another area that's getting a lot of attention is the industrial transition.""
    

        ""There's a lot of AI applications in manufacturing or digitizing the manufacturing sector,"" she added. ""If someone is looking to work in a hot tech startup, these solutions can have a meaningful impact in terms of energy efficiency and resource efficiency. They're very exciting.""
    

        Caroline Grey, the founder of supply chain logistics startup Treefera, Grey, encouraged graduates to expand their horizons and search for climate-adjacent roles. The startup doesn't bill itself as a climate tech company per se, but it has found that a significant portion of its clients come from the carbon tech and energy sectors.
    

        Graduates who want to have a positive climate impact could apply for jobs at startups that sit at the intersection of climate and various other industries, Grey said.
    

        ""For us, we have a very scientific team — so definitely, if you're coming from a science point of view, there is an education and degree level in science that's important,"" she said. ""At the end of the day, governments come and go — and regulation takes a long time to settle in and out.""

MRK Stock
 
While the broader S&P Healthcare index has risen by 6% this year, and investors have generally favored healthcare stocks as a defensive strategy amid concerns over the economic impact of Trump’s tariffs, Merck stock (NYSE:MRK) has fallen by 10%. This underperformance can be attributed, in part, to investors factoring in the impending loss of market exclusivity for its key drug, Keytruda. With only three years remaining, and Keytruda accounting for a substantial 46% (nearly $30 billion) of Merck's total sales, the challenge of bridging this revenue gap is significant. Additionally, slowing sales of Gardasil in China have contributed to investor caution.
However, Merck's stock is now trading at attractive valuations. Historically, pharmaceutical companies approaching a patent cliff often pursue aggressive acquisitions or collaborations. AbbVie's successful collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim for Skyrizi, along with other strategic acquisitions, demonstrates how such moves can effectively mitigate the impact of biosimilar competition, as seen with Humira.
We beleive that MRK stock looks an attractive pick to buy at its current price of around $90. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with MRK stock, which makes it attractive given that its current valuation looks moderate. 
  We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of MRK stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Merck along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception.
Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, MRK stock is currently valued in line with the broader market.
Merck's Revenues have seen notable growth over recent years.
Merck's profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe.
Merck's balance sheet looks strong.
MRK stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on MRK stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Merck Stock Go In A Market Crash? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes.
In summary, Merck's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows:
Despite Merck’s solid performance across key metrics, its stock maintains a moderate valuation, which we believe makes it an attractive stock to buy.
While MRK stock looks promising, investing in a single stock can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Companies have warned of rising prices. Markets have plunged. Bad vibes are back. President Donald Trump's tariff plans might not be in full force yet — but Americans are feeling the strain.

        Trump's so-called ""Liberation Day"" is here. It's the name he gave April 2, when he's expected to unveil a range of broad tariffs on key trading partners. Leading up to the announcements, the University of Michigan's consumer survey in late March found that Americans' outlook on the economy took a dive — consumer sentiment was down 11.9% from February and 28.2% from one year ago.
    

Inflation fears largely drove the downturn, and consumers are worried about ""the potential for pain amid ongoing economic policy developments,"" the survey said. One of those developments is Trump's tariff plans; Trump has maintained that his trade policies would bring in revenue and restore jobsbut acknowledged in February that Americans would feel ""some pain"" as a result.
    

        That pain has already started taking shape. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said during a March press conference that American consumers' gloomy outlook — particularly around high grocery prices — ""probably has to do with turmoil at the beginning of an administration that's making big changes in policy.""
    

        Powell also said that ""a good part"" of the Federal Open Market Committee's latest inflation projections, which showed higher inflation than its December forecast, was a response to Trump's shifting tariff announcements.
    

        ""I do think with the arrival of the tariff inflation, further progress may be delayed,"" Powell said.
    

        Trade policy experts have said companies might absorb some of the cost of Trump's planned tariffs, but Americans are likely to see higher prices on goods like groceries and cars. While Trump has also said that his plans would promote production in the US, the uncertainty is leaving markets, businesses, and Americans on edge.
    

        Alex Jacquez, an advisor on the National Economic Council under former President Joe Biden, told reporters on a Tuesday press call that uncertainty around Trump's trade policy makes it ""hard for the American people to see that they are going to have a strategy long term for how they should be spending their money and investing.""
    

        ""When the president doesn't have a clear strategy or direction, it is extremely difficult for businesses in particular and consumers as well, to plan for the future, and that's why you're seeing so much uncertainty in the consumer market right now and so much uncertainty in the business community,"" Jacquez said.
    

        Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, told Business Insider that ""fearmongering by the media and Democrats about President Trump's America First economic agenda isn't going to change the fact that industry leaders have already made trillions in investment commitments to make in America.""
    

        ""President Trump used tariffs to deliver historic job, wage, and economic growth with no inflation in his first term, and he's set to restore American Greatness in his second term,"" Desai said.
    

        Joseph Dennis, 73, voted for Trump but previously told BI he was concerned about the administration's decisions on tariffs and federal job cuts and wished they were less extreme. He's one of many retirees watching their investments fluctuate in value under Trump.
    

        ""I hope he knows what he's doing, but I'm not so sure,"" Dennis said.
    

Stock markets worldwide have swung wildly in anticipation of Trump's Liberation Day. Major US stock indexes dropped sharply to start the week before staging a rebound and ended Tuesday's session mostly higher as investors braced for the tariff announcement.
    

        It's not just Liberation Day — markets have been fluctuating for weeks in response to Trump's shifting tariff announcements. Additionally, some companies have been preparing to raise prices in anticipation of Trump's tariff plans. Target CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC in early March that Trump's tariff policy could lead the company to raise prices on produce.
    

        Trump has previously said a range of tariffs would go into effect on April 2, including levies on goods from Canada and Mexico, automobiles, and reciprocal tariffs on the countries that have imposed tariffs on US goods. However, the president told reporters on March 23 that he ""may give a lot of countries a break.""
    

        ""I don't change. But the word flexibility is an important word,"" Trump said.
    

        That ""flexibility"" is making it difficult for businesses and consumers to prepare for the future, Heather Boushey, an economist who served on former President Joe Biden's Council of Economic Advisors, told reporters.
    

        ""Both businesses and consumers are getting shaken by this approach,"" Boushey said. ""They see it as chaotic. They don't see what the plan is, but there's a concept of a plan, and that expectations are falling and falling rapidly.""

38,2025-04-01,"🕒 Last checked on April 4, 2025 — Price and availability confirmed at time of writing, but now even lower at $298.
If you’ve been eyeing a Pixel but don’t want to drop nearly $500, this Pixel 8a refurbished deal is way too good to ignore. For just $298, you’re getting the full Tensor G3 experience, 128GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, and Android 14 straight out of the box. It’s also fully unlocked for Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T, and more. That means no carrier lock-ins and total freedom on your plan.
Even better? This isn’t some beat-up secondhand unit. It’s rated “Refurbished – Excellent,” which usually means near-perfect condition with minimal cosmetic flaws—Amazon’s Renewed program backs it with a 90-day replacement/refund policy too.
Most reviews for this renewed Pixel 8a mention how “it looks and performs like new.” One buyer even said they couldn’t tell the difference between this and a fresh retail unit. That tracks, considering it’s still running the same flagship-level Tensor chip as the regular model.
This deal won’t stick around. Only 3 units are left at this price, and it’s been selling fast this past month. If your old phone’s lagging, crashing, or barely making it through the day, this upgrade will feel like night and day. And since you’re not paying the full price, you can finally grab a flagship-level Pixel without wrecking your wallet.
Get it while it’s still in stock—this is one of the most aggressive discounts we’ve seen on a like-new Pixel 8a.
🔍 Deals change fast! We’ll keep this post updated as prices change.

39,2025-04-01,"🕒 Last checked on April 4, 2025 — Price and availability confirmed at time of writing, but now cheaper at $495.98

If you’re thinking about upgrading to Google’s latest phone but don’t want to drop $700+, this Pixel 9 refurbished deal brings that dream within reach. For just $495.98, you get a factory-renewed Pixel 9 in “Excellent” condition, fully unlocked and loaded with Gemini AI, a 6.3″ Actua display, 128GB storage, and that buttery Tensor G3 chip.
This isn’t a stripped-down Pixel Lite version either. It’s the full-on flagship with 24-hour battery life, pro-level camera smarts (especially in low light), and Google’s signature software polish. The only real difference? It’s been renewed—and Amazon backs that with a 90-day replacement/refund policy, so you’re covered if anything feels off.
Multiple buyers have said their units looked brand new out of the box. In fact, some said they’d “never guess it was refurbished” if the listing didn’t mention it. Gemini AI also adds a layer of smarts to your daily use—whether it’s live transcription, on-device summarization, or real-time assistant features that actually work.
Only 3 left at this price, and these deals don’t usually last long, especially for phones this new. This is also one of the lowest prices we’ve seen on a renewed Pixel 9 so far—and $134 off a phone this new is rare.
If you’ve been holding off on a new flagship, now’s the time to pull the trigger.

40,2025-04-01,"The Touch Grass skins cover over 100 device models.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Dbrand today unveiled a wild new way to customize your devices—cases and skins that actually feel like real grass.
These textured covers called Touch Grass bring a touch of nature straight to your hands, giving your phone a whole new vibe. And they’re available for over 100 different devices.
The Touch Grass skins and cases aren’t just for phones; they’re covering everything from Google Pixels and MacBooks to the Steam Deck. And in case you're wondering, despite the April 1 launch, this isn't some elaborate April Fools' joke; it’s 100% real.
Dbrand has a history of using April Fools’ Day to drop some pretty wild ideas, and today’s launch is no different. Back in 2022, the company introduced DIY skins, letting people cut their own vinyl wraps. The ""Deluxe"" kit came with a 2x3 vinyl sheet, some fancy Japanese tools (a ruler and a knife), and a nearly $100 price tag. Meanwhile, the budget-friendly ""Classic"" version was just a tiny 1x1 vinyl square for $25. It was perfect for covering, well, not much.
As for the new grass-like skins, Dbrand says they were actually supposed to drop last April, but making fake grass feel real at a microscopic level turned out to be way harder ""than coming up with the product name.""
Bringing this concept to life wasn’t easy, as per the company's press release. Dbrand had to figure out how to electrostatically apply polyethylene fibers and cut them cleanly without making a mess.
Speaking of weird phone cases, researcher Marc Teyssier from Télécom ParisTech created Skin-On back in 2019. It was a creepy but fascinating touch interface that felt like human skin.

This unsettling innovation lets phones, wearables, and touchpads react to different kinds of touch, making interactions a little too lifelike. The prototype responded to both pressure and touch sensations, but it never made it to market.
On the other hand, Dbrand takes these wild ideas and turns them into real products—like the Doomsday Kit and The DIY Project. While their approach is full of satire, it leads to actual, purchasable items.

41,2025-04-01,"A spectrometer is one of those tools that many of us would love to have, but just can’t justify the price of. Sure there are some DIY options out there, but few of them have the convenience or capability of what’s on the commercial market. [Chris] from Zoid Technology recently found a portable spectrometer complete with Android application for just $150 USD on AliExpress which looked very promising…at least at first.
The problem is that the manufacturer, Torch Bearer, offers more expensive models of this spectrometer. In an effort to push users into those higher-priced models, arbitrary features such as data export are blocked in the software. [Chris] first thought he could get around this by reverse engineering the serial data coming from the device (interestingly, the spectrometer ships with a USB-to-serial adapter), but while he got some promising early results, he found that the actual spectrometer data was obfuscated — a graph of the results looked like stacks of LEGOs.

His next step was to decompile the Android application and manually edit out the model number checks. This let him enable the blocked features, although to be fair, he did find that some of them actually did require additional hardware capabilities that this cheaper model apparently doesn’t posses. He was able to fix up a few other wonky issues in the application that are described in the video below, and has released a patch that you can use to bring your own copy of the software up to snuff.
But that’s not all — while fiddling around inside the Android tool’s source code, he found the missing pieces he needed to understand how the serial data was being obfuscated. The explanation to how it works is pretty long-winded, so we’ll save time and just say that the end result was the creation of a Python library that lets you pull data from the spectrometer without relying on any of the manufacturer’s software. This is the kind of thing a lot of people have been waiting for, so we’re eager to see what kind of response the GPLv3 licensed tool gets from the community.
If you’d still rather piece together your own spectrometer, we’ve seen some pretty solid examples you can use to get started.


This is interesting, I could find it useful for measuring the spectral output of LED’s. Especially white ones when building light panels.
I wonder if the Android app patch fixes any opsec issues too?
I’m not keen on locked down hardware but patch files, this feels different, feels like piracy, so, what’s next, crack files and keygens for Autocad or are we a way off that yet??
Hopefully we’ll get there soon if we aren’t there yet.
If you buy it, it’s yours to do whatever you want with it. Don’t give the device the functionality if you don’t want people to use it.
Same with heated seats in BMWs. I buy a car with a heating coil in the seat and a relay to switch it? I’m gonna use it.
” crack files and keygens for Autocad ”
Yep….Soon I hope.
Just as unlocking seat warmers for free instead of $5/mo is not “piracy”, so isn’t this. The hardware is there and belongs to the user, they should be able to use and communicate with it freely.
Not only should the user have this right ethics-wise, users have the right to RE such obfuscation in the EU legally.
There is some irony there, given the example is BMW
I agree with hardware hacking to enable functionality but this isn’t a hardware hack, it’s cracking/patching a piece of application software to enable extra features that weren’t paid for.
So, as far as I understand it, it’s piracy.
However, if you can show me which EU law allows cracking licensed software then I’m happy to change my opinion.
Cling on to whatever entitled option you want, we don’t want it.
Most likely is a general chip across all lines will be used (economics of one), then specific functionality will be behind blowable fuses, demonstrating possession or lack of is determined by control, not presence.
https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2487&context=law_and_economics
I think I agree with you on this one, Anonymous. If he looked at the serial data and figured out what it meant, and then wrote his own software to interpret it I would think he was clever. But if he is reverse engineering a piece of non-open source software to enable features he didn’t pay for that are available if he made a different purchase and then teaching others how to do the same, I think it is morally wrong.
Of course I have no idea how the laws would actually interpret this.
CNC Machines famously have unlock codes for almost every option.  High speed machining, 5000 dollar option.  Bolt hole circle conversational, 800 dollar option.  Its all in the based code, and the hardware (if any is even required) exists in the machine already.  I can order those options even today for a 20yr old Haas machine and with a phone call they’ll give me an unlock code.  Would I love those options for free?  Yes of course, but they cost money to develop and the piecemeal system lets people get into machines for cheaper.  Of course I don’t have to pay a monthly fee to turn the machine on either.
I think they assemble the seat heating functionality with a loss, if never bring activated.
Once people buy the feature, more than these costs return. So they go into a risk investment. Enabling them is not theft.
But offering the service for money may be the case (just like selling hacked windows licenses)
My man, are you April Foolin’ us?
1) The company selling the product lied about the functionality being shipped in that version – software modified to make it not a lie
2) The software was broken (showing sun is green, etc) – software rewritten to work
Now, either you skimmed the article and skipped the video, or you’ve got some weird ideas about who was screwing over whom in this case.
I’d love to see a tear down of the hardware involved. Those webcam spectrometers are fine for roughly profiling bright light sources but tend to be a let down for most anything else. But we are in an era where soon there will be affordable mostly capable hardware hitting the market. So someone please tear one of these down for science and to personally save me money. Well… I already have several diy spectrometers… Maybe I don’t need anymore…
Project 326 did a teardown of their Torch Bearer spectrometer in a review they did earlier in the year.

Amazing, thank you.  Now a mystery of the Quantum Dots used on the CMOS sensor.
I would love to see some data on the high CRI white LED.  Or even if a targeted Blue filter could make it more like an incandescent.  Very neat stuff.
Wow nice reverse engineering! Not sure if a hobbiest would ever need one.
Your hobbies clearly aren’t as diverse as other people’s.
He paid for the tool, disassembled the Android binary, and put together so it worked better for him.  That’s not piracy.  If you go download his work to enhance your device that’s piracy.
This might make hobbyist grading of light quality possible.
Also could probably develop a filter that removes some blue from cheap LED if one was feeling extra hacky.
At least in the US, this is probably “actionable” — not “illegal” per se, but based on prior cases, if someone brought this to court, they’d probably be able to move forward with a lawsuit or other enforcement action — this goes back all the way to 56k modems that were “locked at 28.8” and sold as cheaper modems. People figured out how to unlock and the manufacturer took action.
It’s not like the company would go after individual owners but takedown notices of any info on unlocking features seems a likely action.
This BS situation is all about “ownership” vs licensing and unfortunately in the US you still can’t yet repair your own tractor …
I have found that something like this:

Asian equities rebounded on light volumes following Monday’s steep sell-off. One media outlet called it “Black Monday” after the U.S.’ 1929 market crash. Meanwhile, Taiwan and South Korea were both up nearly +3%, India and Singapore underperformed, and Indonesia, Malaysia, and Pakistan all continued to be closed for Eid al-Fitr. Hong Kong and Mainland China posted small gains though off intra-day highs as the Shanghai, Shenzhen, Hang Seng, and Hang Seng Tech indexes have all eased back to the February levels.
An astonishing 49% of Hong Kong turnover was driven by Southbound Stock Connect trading as Mainland investors bought a net $2.6 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs. The primary beneficiaries of Southbound buying were the Hong Kong Tracker ETF, the Hang Seng China Enterprises ETF, Alibaba, and Xpeng. Yes, volumes were light overnight as investors remain on the sideline in advance of Wednesday’s “Liberation Day,” though it shows how little foreign interest there is in Hong Kong-listed stocks.
Monday was quarter-end, though everyone spoke about the year-to-date performance of Mainland China and Hong Kong versus the U.S. How about the 1-year performance number as of quarter-end (in U.S. dollar terms)?
As our long-time friend Steve would say, these markets are ""under-owned, unloved, and in an uptrend."" On Monday, there were a few market-moving items, which we've highlighted below.
The March Caixin Manufacturing purchasing managers’ index came in at 51.2 versus expectations of 50.6 and February’s 50.8. This is after Monday’s ""official"" survey likewise indicated stronger-than-expected growth in manufacturing in March. See all the headlines on the positive China economic release? Me neither.
Xiaomi fell -5.49% and was Hong Kong’s most heavily traded stock by nearly 3X after a fatal accident involving a SU7 electric vehicle (EV) that reportedly was engaged in autonomous driving. This tragic accident weighed on peers, including BYD, which fell -1.68 %, and the Mainland-listed battery giant CATL, which fell -1.53%, though Xpeng gained +5.58% on reports that unmanned flying vehicles are getting closer to implementation.
After the close, BYD reported selling 377,420 new energy vehicles (NEVs), including fully electric and hybrid electric vehicles, in March. This brings the Q1 total to 1,000,804, up +59.81% year-over-year (YoY), though -34.34% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ). NIO sold 15,039 cars in March, XPeng sold 33,205, Li Auto sold 36,674, and Xiaomi sold 29,000.
Vanke weighed on real estate stocks after reporting a 2024 net loss of RMB 49 billion.
Healthcare was the top sector in both Hong Kong and Mainland China. The Mainland’s most heavily traded stock, Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceutical, gained +5.28% after the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) stated healthcare state-owned enterprises (SOEs) should invest in biotech and the National Medical Products Administration released a paper on supporting medical devices. Remember from the Dual Sessions that raising China’s fertility rate is becoming a bigger focus to tackle demographic challenges.
Huawei reported 2024 financial results. Revenue increased +22.4% YoY to RMB 862 billion, though net profit fell -28% to RMB 62.6 billion.
The Qiushi Journal published an article written by President Xi on the importance of science and technology.
Mainland-listed Luxshare Precision (002475 CH) -1.1% despite chatter that it will relist in HK. This is interesting as the effect of mainland-listed companies relisting in HK would, in the long run, raise China’s weight in MSCI indices.
The U.S. dollar strengthened overnight. As mentioned previously, markets are expecting tariff Armageddon, which might happen, but what if it doesn’t happen or gets rescinded quickly through negotiations?
The People’s Daily had an article Monday on the follow through on the March 6 State Council’s “Special Action Plan to Boost Consumption."" The Ministry of Finance will issue a total of RMB 300 billion worth of ultra-long-term special government bonds to “support the expansion of the old-for-new exchange of consumer goods."" The People’s Bank of China will “implement a moderately loose monetary policy” and create consumer policies focused on “cultural tourism, elderly care, and sports."" The article states another focus area will be “increasing residents’ income as the key to boosting consumption."" While last September’s stimulus announcements led to the market ripping, this statement has had far less of an effect on markets, though arguably it is equally important.

BERO Brewing's VP of Marketing will help you hone your marketing Spidey senses.

When actor Tom Holland made the late-night rounds last October to talk about his new company, BERO Brewing, he said that he'd “find myself in these boardrooms” surrounded by experts spouting unfamiliar terms.

The once and future Spider-Man told Seth Meyers, “thank God I found acting,” because it took “every bit of acting chops I’ve got to convince them I know what I’m talking about.""
Today’s master of marketing is one of those boardroom experts, and her marketing wisdom will help you hone your Spidey senses — whether you’ve got a celebrity-founded brand or not.

Your product or service isn’t for everybody. And trying to market to everybody will dilute your message like a watered-down beer.
“We know that every person who likes a beer isn't going to try a non-alcoholic one,” Widmann says. So “remembering that you can’t be everything for everyone is really important, and it’s something I’ve tried to bring into the ecosystem of what we’ve built at BERO.”
For instance, extensive consumer testing found that people — whether they’re sober, participating in Dry January, or just want a night off — are frustrated with the taste and look of other NA beers they’ve tried. Widmann says that rather than trying to persuade beer drinkers to pick up an NA can, BERO’s focus has been on elevating its products to address those grievances.
Don’t pour your resources into marketing to the wrong audience; you might as well be pouring a beer down the drain.
Widmann says it’s been important from the beginning that BERO is “an additive to your drinking and social consumption behaviors” — not a substitute.
“One of the biggest things we’ve noticed about the non-alc space is that a lot of brands are speaking to non-alcoholic options as a substitute. We want to create a product that’s the gold standard.”
The more I thought about it, the more I realized: This is great advice, non-alcoholic beer or no. Chances are good that whatever you’re marketing, you’re not the only product or service in that space.
NA beer isn’t new, but good NA beer is another story. “People often say that the non-alc beer options they’ve tried feel like a lesser version of beer,” Widmann says. “It’s a little watered down. Maybe the carbonation is not quite at the level it needs to be.”
Plus, “a lesser version of beer” doesn’t exactly make for a great marketing slogan. So focus on what you can add to your customers’ lives and be the gold standard in your category.
Even though BERO has Tom Holland behind it — and, by all accounts, he’s very involved at every level — it’s still a new company trying to break through in a market where every Hollywood A-lister seemingly has their own beverage line.
Widmann is a veteran marketer in the beverage industry, and she says that having Holland behind the brand isn’t a shortcut.
Good marketing isn’t about slapping a celebrity face on a new product; Widmann tells me they’ve done extensive consumer testing and have tried different marketing plays to find what works best. For instance, when Holland writes something in his own words and tags BERO, the posts outperform any Tom Holland x BERO collaboration posts.
So on those days when you find yourself daydreaming about working for your favorite celeb, remember: You still gotta do the work.
What are your thoughts on the ongoing “attribution” controversy? And what's the right amount of attribution without getting overly scientific/metrics-focused with your marketing strategy? —Alex Lieberman, co-founder of Morning Brew
Widmann: When you’re building a new brand from the ground-up, you don’t have historical data to look at as you evaluate performance.
We’re doing everything that we can to combine a mix of more tactical metrics (i.e., sales of our products across channels as we invest in various marketing tactics, how quickly we are growing our community and how engaged they are with the information we’re sharing with them, and of course monitoring sentiment around everything that we say and do).
The best thing brands can do right now is to operate with a connected strategy and look at every moment as an opportunity to be 360 – and truly analyze your results in the same way.
Widmann asks: Right now, it feels like so many brands are investing in beautifully produced, curated, experiential moments that are intended to drive awareness and shareability (and are likely very expensive). How do you think new brands with limited budgets should approach this tactic and still manage to cut through the clutter?

47,2025-04-01,"Stock edged lower on Tuesday after economic indicators showed further softening ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariff announcement on Wednesday. The S&P 500 fell 0.6% as of 10:10 a.m, Nasdaq Composite slid 0.4% and  the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1%.
The ISM manufacturing index fell by more than expected in March to 49.0 from 50.3 in February, with the new orders reading dropping to 45.2 from 48.6. A number under 50 indicates a contraction. The JOLTS job opening tally fell by more than expected in February, to 7.57 million. On the upside, construction spending rebounded by more than projected in February as weather improved.
Investors are listening for any hints about Trump’s unveiling of import taxes. The announcement will focus on “country-based” duties, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Monday, and while the president still plans sectoral tariffs, they won’t be the focus of Wednesday’s event.
Trump said Sunday that he plans to start reciprocal tariffs with “all countries,” countering speculation he might limit the initial scope of his April 2 announcement, Bloomberg reported.
Be on the lookout for hoaxes — it’s April Fools Day.
Here are some stocks to watch today:
CoreWeave rebounded, rising 2.3% following Monday’s 7.3% decline in its second day of trading after its underwhelming IPO. The tepid market reception may be a sign that hype over AI is subsiding. Nvidia (NVDA) fell about 0.8%.
Ford’s (F) stock fell about 1.3% after it said that its first-quarter sales fell 1.3%. Sales of electric vehicles and hybrids gained 26% to a record.
PVH’s stock surged 17% after the owner of the Calvin Klein (PVH) and Tommy Hilfiger brands projected that sales would be flat to slightly higher this fiscal year compared with last. The consensus analyst forecast had been for a decline, according to FactSet. 
Tesla (TSLA) shares gained 1%  after declining 1.7% on Monday. The company’s first-quarter sales, due Wednesday, will probably disappoint investors, analysts said, with some trimming their forecasts to below 400,000 units.
Xiaomi’s (XIACF) ADRs plunged 7.4% after the Chinese EV maker confirmed  reports that one of its SU7 models had been involved in a crash on an expressway in China, Bloomberg reported. Local media said that three people died in the accident.
XPeng’s (XPEV) U.S.-traded shares gained 1.1% after the Chinese EV-maker said its deliveries surged 268% in March from a year earlier to 33,205 units. Quarterly sales jumped 331%.

NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 28: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on ... More March 28, 2025, in New York City. As President Trump's escalating trade war and signs of inflation concern investors, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) dropped more than 700 points or nearly 1.7%.

I believe the U.S. economy is at a precarious crossroads. Growth is slowing faster than expected, inflation remains stubbornly high, and fiscal imbalances are becoming harder to ignore. For investors, policymakers, and households alike, this moment demands sharp focus and decisive action. The risks of stagflation—a toxic combination of rising unemployment and persistent inflation—are no longer theoretical. They’re knocking at the door.
Let’s break down the key challenges shaping this precarious moment and what they mean for the road ahead.
The February Personal Consumption Expenditures report delivered a sobering reality check: U.S. economic growth is decelerating more quickly than anyone anticipated. Wage and salary compensation have fallen below trend rates for the first time since March 2021, signaling cracks in the labor market that are hard to ignore.
Immigration, a critical driver of workforce expansion, is slowing dramatically. This isn’t just a short-term issue—it’s a structural problem that will weigh on nonfarm payrolls in the months ahead. While housing activity remains surprisingly strong, with residential construction payrolls at cycle highs, it’s clear that these isolated bright spots won’t offset broader economic headwinds (Trading Economics).
The bottom line? A cooling labor market means less disposable income for consumers to spend, which could drag growth lower in the coming quarters.
For those hoping inflation would ease as growth slows—think again. The February PCE data suggests inflationary pressures are not only persistent but could accelerate further in the near term. This raises the specter of stagflation; a scenario where rising prices collide with a weakening economy.
Tariffs and geopolitical tensions are exacerbating these pressures by driving up production costs across industries. Corporate earnings are already feeling the squeeze, with semiconductor stocks flashing warning signs of slower sales—a troubling indicator for tech-heavy sectors that have been key drivers of growth in recent years (KPMG).
For households, higher prices are eroding purchasing power, forcing tough choices on spending priorities. This dynamic creates a vicious cycle: weaker consumption leads to slower growth, which in turn makes it harder to tame inflation without triggering deeper economic pain.
If inflation and slowing growth weren’t enough to worry about, fiscal policy presents its own set of challenges. Government transfer payments surged by 18% on a three-month annualized basis, temporarily boosting disposable income. But this fiscal sugar rush masks deeper structural issues that can’t be ignored.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent recently stated that America has a spending problem – not a revenue problem. He may be spot on, because government revenues as a percent of GDP are near long-term trends, but government spending far exceeds those trends. Spending on politically protected programs, like Medicaid, now exceeds total federal revenue. With debt-to-GDP ratios at 112% and deficits-to-GDP at 7%, the U.S. is on an unsustainable fiscal trajectory.
Bond markets are starting to take notice. Yields are biased higher as investors demand greater compensation for holding U.S. debt amid mounting structural imbalances. Budgetary gimmicks may buy time politically, but they won’t fool bondholders who see through short-term fixes.
The risk? Advancing deficit-expanding legislation during what Darius Dale at 42 Macro is calling potentially a “self-inflicted technical recession” could push borrowing costs even higher—tightening financial conditions further at precisely the wrong time.
Credit markets offer conflicting clues about where we’re headed next. Credit spreads have widened slightly but remain below levels typically seen before recessions. Historically, 10% corrections have been buying opportunities absent a recession — but I think this time feels different.
The recent $4 trillion drop in household net worth underscores how quickly wealth effects can reverse consumption trends (Reuters). Stock market rallies have propped up spending in recent years, but retrenchments like this one remind us how fragile consumer-driven growth really is.
President Donald Trump’s declaration of April 2 as “Liberation Day” may aim to inspire confidence, but global markets exposed to U.S.-centric risks could interpret it as a red flag rather than a rallying cry. The interplay between stock market volatility and consumer sentiment will be critical to watch in the months ahead.
In times like these, staying informed isn’t just smart, it’s essential. Here are four key areas investors should monitor closely:
This is not a moment for complacency. The U.S. economy faces significant risks that require vigilance from both policymakers and investors. Slowing growth, persistent inflation, unsustainable fiscal policies, each of these challenges alone would be difficult to manage. Together, they create a precarious situation that demands immediate attention.
For policymakers, addressing structural weaknesses like immigration reform and entitlement spending is no longer optional, it’s imperative. For investors, caution is warranted as markets navigate an environment fraught with uncertainty.
The road ahead won’t be easy, but moments like these also present opportunities for those who stay informed and prepared. As always, vigilance and adaptability will be key to navigating what lies ahead."

It's been a great year for Zen Honeycutt and her grassroots advocacy group Moms Across America.
President Trump appointed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — a longtime ally and adviser to her organization — to become the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. Honeycutt, who considers herself part of Kennedy's ""Making America Healthy Again"" (MAHA) movement, literally cried tears of joy when she heard Kennedy was selected. And she traveled to Capitol Hill, where she had a front-row seat at Kennedy's Senate confirmation hearing.
Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., cited her organization's work when introducing a bill to eliminate toxic substances in school lunches and increase support for organic farmers and others who farm using sustainable practices.
After years of having her research and advocacy dismissed as fringe, kooky or ignorable by mainstream media outlets, scientists, regulators and much of the public, Honeycutt's organization recently co-sponsored a study that got lots of people talking about toxic contaminants in the U.S. food supply.
The study made a big splash probably because it focused on something as American as apple pie: Girl Scout cookies. It found trace amounts of heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury), aluminum and an herbicide called glyphosate, the active ingredient in the weed killer Roundup, in the cookies.
""This is not just about Girl Scout cookies,"" Honeycutt says. ""Pretty much all cookies, unless they're organic, are gonna have probably the same results.""
In fact, a lot of food in general — anything that's not organic — is probably going to have similar results. Basically by definition, non-organic, conventional foods are exposed to synthetic pesticides and herbicides like glyphosate. And heavy and other metals can be found in lots of foods, including organic foods, because they're often found in the environment, including the soil that plants absorb and animals then eat.
At least two fact-checking sites have investigated this study of Girl Scout cookies and have concluded that its findings are ""misleading"" and, basically, not as scary as they may sound. We spoke with a toxicologist, Joe Zagorski at Michigan State University's Center for Research on Ingredient Safety, who said something similar. Zagorski criticized the cookie study for its small sample size (25 cookies), its lack of peer review and other methodological issues. And he contended that the levels of heavy metals, aluminum and herbicide that the study found in the cookies are not dangerous.
The level of glyphosate found in the Girl Scout cookies, for example, is so extremely small, Zagorski says, that a 70-pound child ""would have to eat over 73,000 cookies a day to reach a level that could cause concern"" over their lifetime. Look, maybe I could do it, but … that's a lot of cookies.
Zagorski says it's a similar story with the trace amounts of heavy metals and aluminum found in the cookies. This is all OK, he assured us. There's a saying in toxicology: ""The dosage makes the poison."" And this dosage, he says, according to a lot of peer-reviewed scientific evidence and government regulatory standards, is so low that it's not a concern.
The study, nonetheless, has proved to be a PR nightmare for the Girl Scouts. It went viral on social media and was referenced by juggernaut podcaster Joe Rogan. It even recently inspired a pending class-action lawsuit against the Girl Scouts, which generated another wave of bad press.
""While we don't comment on pending litigation, we remain committed to vigorously defending ourselves against these allegations and supporting our Girl Scouts throughout the country who are actively learning entrepreneurial and leadership skills through the Girl Scout Cookie Program,"" said a Girl Scouts of the USA spokesperson. The Girl Scouts published a blog post in February addressing the study and assured cookie eaters that ""Girl Scout Cookies are safe to consume and are manufactured in accordance with all food safety regulations.""
Criticisms of Moms Across America's study aside, the attention it has received could be seen as a win for Honeycutt's goals of getting more Americans to reconsider what they put into their bodies, avoid conventional foods and buy organic, and question whether food companies and the government are doing a good enough job of making sure our food is safe.
This whole saga shines a spotlight on the rising levels of distrust in American institutions. In 2025, no organization is above suspicion, even the Girl Scouts. And this breakdown of trust complicates solutions to a core economic problem we face in our consumer society: We often lack complete information about the things we consume, and we rely on trust in authorities to assure us that what we consume is safe. What happens when those authorities lose people's trust?
When we go to the grocery store and buy something, we face an economic problem. Economists have a wonky term for it. They call it ""asymmetric information."" It's a mouthful. But the idea is simple in the food realm. We often don't really know or have a hard time verifying what's in the stuff we eat and drink. And that lack of information can create problems in a free market, like companies selling us food that can make us sick, maybe slowly over years without us even knowing it.
Consumers need information to make the best choices for themselves and their families when they shop, and without that information, companies may not face strong enough market incentives to produce high-quality or safe products. It's often cheaper to cut corners, use lower quality ingredients and make food products in unsanitary conditions. If consumers don't really know what's going on, then companies may not face market pressure to do the right thing. The economics literature suggests that, because of imperfect information, the free market can fail to operate in our best interests.
Economists and policymakers have long cited the problem of asymmetric information as a core reason that food companies need to be regulated. Over the 20th century, lawmakers created the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies to ensure trust and safety in the food supply. And they required food companies to label their products with ingredients and nutritional information. This has helped consumers make the leap of faith when buying and ingesting stuff made by strangers — and overcome the asymmetric information problem.
But as Moms Across America's studies have shown, there are often small amounts of substances in our food that are not labeled. It's not just Girl Scout cookies. The organization, for example, sponsored tests of school lunches, fast food, beer and wine, and baby formula — and Honeycutt says they've found contaminants that concern her in all of them.
In some cases, scientists have directly engaged with these findings and concluded that the levels of contaminants they've found aren't a significant concern for public health. For example, an article in a scientific journal, Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology, investigated one of Moms Across America's studies that found glyphosate in urine and breast milk. It concluded the finding ""does not support the conclusion that [these] glyphosate concentrations … present a health risk to the public, including nursing children.""
However, Honeycutt believes ingesting even small levels of contaminants can affect our health. She says that these contaminants are so widespread throughout the food supply that they add up in our diets over a lifetime.
Honeycutt is a strong believer in the health benefits of eating organic and non-GMO (or non-bioengineered) foods. She says when making that switch for her family, they saw real health benefits.
Having grown up in hippie-dippie California, and as a frequent shopper at health food stores, I can tell you that many people — including my loved ones — believe that organic is healthier. They also tend to believe that organic is a signal of other desirable attributes, like tasting better or being made by small, local farms with more love and care (although this might not always be true). Despite these products typically costing more, the market for organic food has exploded over the last couple of decades.
This is maybe why I was a bit surprised to hear from Zagorski that scientists doubt whether organic and non-GMO foods are really better for us. ""The scientific consensus on organic farming practices, and GMO versus non-GMO, is that non-GMO and organic foods are not safer than conventionally grown crops,"" Zagorski says. ""There is no major health benefit to eating organic versus non-organic. And so the fact of the matter is that, no, non-GMO and organic are not healthier for us.""
That may be a tough one to swallow for many of us. Like, really?! What about all the pesticides and herbicides and hormones and antibiotics and bioengineering in conventional foods? I've talked to various organic eaters about this scientific literature that suggests that organic isn't safer or healthier, and they told me things like ""scientific conclusions change over time."" This certainly seems to be true in the area of nutrition science, which is difficult to conduct and evolves as new evidence comes to light. Take wine. Scientific studies used to suggest that a glass of wine a day was fine, even healthy. Now evidence is suggesting any amount of alcohol may be a cancer risk. It's a huge bummer.
America is in the midst of what you might call a food awakening, and people are questioning what we're putting in our bodies like maybe never before. Researchers are connecting our diets to a surge in all sorts of health maladies, including obesity, heart disease and cancer. This food awakening can be seen beyond just the explosion in demand for organic and non-GMO foods. It can also be seen in the growing concern about the health effects of consuming things like ultraprocessed foods, sugar, alcohol and seemingly ubiquitous microplastics, as well as in movements to ban food dyes and preservatives.
For regulations to work in overcoming the problem of asymmetric information, it's critical that people trust that the regulators are looking out for them.
But economists have long pointed out that sometimes regulators don't serve the public interest. They can come under the influence of the powerful companies they're regulating. Economists call this ""regulatory capture."" It's an empirical question and a big debate in economics and policy circles when and why that happens and how to combat it.
In defending their cookies, the Girl Scouts of the USA stressed that their ""trusted bakers remain committed to compliance with all food safety standards and regulations set forth by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other relevant health authorities.""
Honeycutt says she agrees that the Girl Scouts are complying with existing regulatory standards. But she questions whether those regulations — or lack of regulations — are keeping the public safe. Honeycutt made clear that she believes big corporations have a big influence on the food and agricultural regulations that get implemented. ""Our system is corrupt,"" she says. ""I think we must strive as a democracy to overcome industry capture.""
Zagorski expressed a general faith in the food regulatory process. He went on at great length about ethics rules that discourage conflicts of interest, transparency rules that enable consumers to look at the evidence behind regulatory decisions, and how federal regulatory agencies make decisions based on peer-reviewed science. Zagorski says that regulations on glyphosate, heavy metals and other contaminants are guided by the best available evidence and that regulatory standards for allowable amounts in our food are set extremely low ""out of an abundance of caution to make sure that everybody is safe in the population,"" even the most sensitive.
""I have three little kids, and I would have no issue giving them these cookies,"" says Zagorski. He stresses that the experts who analyze this data and set safety standards ""live in the same environment we live in. They're going to the same stores we go to. They're likely feeding their kids roughly the same things our kids are eating. And so I can't imagine a situation where someone would say that, for the sake of monetary gain, I'm OK with making my child sick.""
But these days, Americans, fed an information diet from social media and subversive podcasts, seem to increasingly distrust the experts and regulatory authorities. For a long time, their authority helped American consumers overcome the problem of asymmetric information about their food. But now, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, a growing number of Americans are distrustful when authorities go against something seemingly intuitive — like the idea that ingesting low levels of herbicides and heavy metals over your lifetime will be bad for your health.
And it can be easy to cast aspersions. Zagorski, for instance, is a highly credentialed professor at a university who has spent his career steeped in the science of this stuff. He has spent years studying the effects of food ingredients and contaminants and promoting public health. At the same time, his institution, the Center for Research on Ingredient Safety at Michigan State University, discloses that it gets some of its funding from ""industry partners,"" which include major corporations, like the Coca-Cola Co., PepsiCo, the Hershey Co. and ConAgra Brands. Should that make you trust him less?
And what about Zen Honeycutt? She is not credentialed in science and often challenges scientific consensus. And her organization, Moms Across America, sells alternative-medicine supplements and products like ""Vaccine Detox Herbal Extract"" and ""LifeWave Frequency Patches"" on its website. Should that make you trust her less?
Honeycutt rejects what seems to be the scientific consensus on issues like the health effects of small doses of glyphosate, aluminum and heavy metals in cookies, as well as the claim that organic is not really better for us. We asked her, if we can't trust what's considered the scientific consensus on what's safe, and if we can't trust the regulators tasked with looking out for our health, who can we trust?
""I think we should trust independent scientists that are not funded by corporations,"" she said. ""I think we should trust ourselves and our friends and family members, our community members that are close to us, that have either used certain products or eaten certain foods and it's worked for them. This is why we encourage in-person connections, and we should tune in to ourselves. Our bodies tell us what is not good for us. When you really tune in, when you eat something and it doesn't work for you, you should trust that.""
Honeycutt also expressed hope that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will help improve trust in our system of food regulation. The Trump administration, however, is slashing the workforce of the Department of Health and Human Services, including 3,500 jobs at the Food and Drug Administration. A recent department fact sheet stresses, ""This reduction will not affect drug, medical device, or food reviewers, nor will it impact inspectors."" But still, with a significantly smaller workforce, won't that undermine the FDA and other regulatory agencies' work? Honeycutt says she believes that Kennedy can do more with a smaller workforce than others have done with a bigger workforce and that he will improve trust in our system of food regulation by, for example, making sure ""the people that are hired to fill the positions in these regulatory agencies can't be bought.""
In fact, she says, she has submitted her résumé and, if she's offered the right position, she's ready to enter public service. She says she trusts Kennedy ""more than probably any other political figure I've ever come in contact with."" Since taking office, Kennedy has prioritized going after contaminants in our food supply, including in baby formula.
So what would it take for Honeycutt to eat some Thin Mints? For the uninitiated, that's a popular kind of Girl Scout cookie, one that her study found had the highest level of glyphosate among the cookies tested. Her answer was simple: ""If they were organic.""

As we enter a period of nearly certain economic volatility, many investors are growing concerned about the durability of their portfolios and looking for ways to batten down the hatches in advance of the storm. These worries are understandable—but frankly, this is an area where advanced preparedness is essential. Hedging against financial risk isn’t just important when facing an impending recession; rather, it’s something smart investors should be considering even in strong economic headwinds.
Unfortunately, many investors approach the market with a gambler’s mentality. Imagine you’re sitting at a blackjack table. If you’re winning, you want to stay, but at some point, it’s smart to pocket some of your winnings and walk away. (My wife is the one who reminds me to cash out, even while I’m tempted to keep playing.)
Investors often behave the same way. When the market is strong, they don’t want to hear about risk management. But when volatility hits, suddenly they panic and want to make big changes. Firms like ours tend to get an influx of clients during “bad” times—but really, it’s during the “good” times that they should be planning ahead and preparing.
There’s a reason investors underperform compared to the market: Emotional decision-making hurts long-term returns. The time to reposition your portfolio isn’t when the market drops 25%—it’s when things are going well. And if you’re nearing retirement, you should already be thinking well ahead about protecting your income sources.
That’s why we recommend taking a structured approach. We start by determining how much money someone will need from their portfolio on an annual basis and then ensure they will have enough set aside for 15-20 years. That’s important because while short-term market movements are unpredictable, over a 15-20 year period, history tells us the market will almost always rally and turn upward again.
If we can protect a client’s withdrawals for that long, they can leave the rest of their portfolio invested, knowing that over the long haul, the market has historically provided strong returns—typically around 10% annually. This means their stock market money, if left untouched, will more than double over the next 10 years.
In this current environment, investors who are thinking of making adjustments to their portfolios—for whatever reason—should consider the following:
1. Interest Rates: We’re in a higher-rate environment than we’ve been used to, but historically speaking, rates are still not that high. They may come down, but likely more slowly than originally expected. Investors need to be mindful of how that affects their portfolios.
2. Market Volatility: How much of your money is vulnerable to market fluctuations? To return to my blackjack analogy, it’s important not to leave all of your chips exposed at any point.
3. Time Horizon: What’s your timeline for needing that money? Some investors might have very few withdrawal needs, particularly if they collect pensions and social security. Others may need more immediate access to that money.
4. Diversification: A traditional mix of stocks and bonds hasn’t performed well over the past decade. Investors need to think beyond this outdated portfolio model.
For investors looking to create and sustain a well-diversified, resilient portfolio, certain financial instruments may help, depending on individual goals and needs:
• Money Market Accounts: These are good short-term options to provide liquidity. Fair warning: They are subject to rate changes. If the market goes down, your interest rate does, too, like a high-yield savings account.
• CDs: CDs are the next rung up the ladder, wherein you invest some money at whatever the current market rate is for a limited period. It might be a decent rate, but again, it’s going to be fairly short-term.
• Fixed Annuities: Similar to CDs, fixed annuities offer longer terms and slightly better rates and are issued by annuity companies rather than banks. You can get a three-year, five-year, seven-year or 10-year fixed annuity that will pay a CD rate of interest, somewhere in the 5-5.5% range, with some limited liquidity.
• Fixed Index Annuities: These provide principal protection while offering returns linked to a market index like the S&P 500—so a variable rate. Some are offering caps of 10% or more, meaning investors can participate in market gains without downside risk.
Having someone in place with a strategy is also of the utmost importance. Instead of a passive buy-and-hold approach, many investors benefit from tactical, real-time management that can better navigate market volatility.
Portfolio protection isn’t just something you think about when markets are bad—it’s something you should always have in mind. You don’t want to be scrambling to adjust when the market drops.
That gambler’s mentality—that when things are good, they’ll always remain that way—confounds many investors. It’s important for overall financial security not to be caught up in that mindset—that you know when to pick up and leave the table.
Take a long-term view. Ensure you have a plan in place, one that is aligned with your current and future financial needs.

Happy Billionaires Day! It’s a busy one here at Forbes, as we just released our annual list of the world’s billionaires, highlighting the richest––and arguably most powerful––people and families across the globe.
In total, Forbes tracked and documented the wealth of more than 3,000 people worth a collective $16.1 trillion. The average fortune on the list now stands at $5.3 billion, a $200 million increase from 2024.
While many of the world’s billionaires inherited their wealth, nearly 70% of the newest names on this year’s list are self-made, meaning they founded or cofounded the company that made them their billions. The newcomers include 73-year-old Sulaiman Al Habib, founder and chairman of Saudi Arabia hospital group HMG, as well as Scale AI cofounder and CEO Alexandr Wang, the list’s youngest self-made billionaire at just 28 years old.
Wang is one of just 21 individuals this year to reach billionaire status under the age of 30. Of those, only Wang and 29-year-old Ed Craven are self-made, with Craven being the cofounder of Stake.com, thought to be the world’s biggest crypto-backed online casino.
So what’s the secret to their riches? For newcomer billionaire Steve Ells, it was Chipotle’s compensation plan. Though Ells sold most of his stock throughout his time as CEO and then chairman of the board at the fast-casual chain, the company’s compensation plan continued to award him Chipotle stock as it kept rising.
And while it was the ultimate sale of fried chicken chain Zaxby that netted its cofounders their billions, it’s the hard work they put into growing the business that allowed it to grow. Cofounder Tony Townley kept his day job running a mortgaging and loan business while running the first Zaxby location, sometimes mixing sometimes until 5 a.m.
It goes to show that while entrepreneurship can be a struggle, it can certainly pay off.

Your favorite finance friends saw their bonuses rise more than 30% last year. Where did the extra cash come from? 
After a profitable year for Wall Street in 2024, its bankers are cashing-in on generous bonuses. The New York State Comptroller said last week that bankers’ bonuses rose 31.5% from the previous year, contributing to a total estimated bonus pool of $47.5 billion.
The increase in performance incentives is largely due to one of the best years in history for the stock market and dealmaking. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each had record years in 2024, and Wall Street’s profits rose 90%.
“Most of the time bonuses are based off of two things: What is your personal performance and what is the company’s performance,” says Nich Tremper, economist at payroll provider Gusto. “It’s discretionary compensation based on those two things.”
Add a securities employment increase––coming in at 201,500 employees, the highest annual level in at least 30 years, according to New York Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli––and you’ve got more employees earning six-figure salaries that qualified for the bonuses. Indeed, average salaries for analysts range from $160,000 to $210,000 per year after bonuses. That number can rise up to $475,000 for associates.
But Wall Street wasn’t the only place to see bonuses increase, albeit at a much lower rate. Average end-of-year bonuses for 2024 were up 2% compared to 2023 payouts for small businesses, according to a January report from Gusto, though the total share of workers who received bonuses decreased.
Apart from Wall Street, those in the communications, technology and professional services industries saw the greatest bonus growth.
Retail, for example, saw an 8% increase in bonuses from 2023 to 2024. But one major retailer held back from them altogether, citing fiscal year performance results. Salaried employees at Target who were eligible for bonuses will only receive 87% of their potential bonus for fiscal year 2024, HR Dive reported, down from the 100% they received the previous year.
The state of the economy has a large part to play in how much employers are distributing to their workers. “A bonus is backwards-looking,” says Tremper. “But it’s also forwards-looking. It’s a business owner deciding that they don’t need to keep that cash in the bank account and can actually invest that into their employees.”
News from the world of work
As the Ivy Leagues continue to amass criticism from wealthy alumni, parents of students and even the federal government, Forbes released its second iteration of the New Ivies list. Employers are increasingly looking at graduates from these 20 public and private universities, including newcomers Washington University in St. Louis, the University of Pittsburgh and the United States Military Academy at West Point, Emma Whitford reports.
Top vaccine official Peter Marks quit his position at the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday, criticizing Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s views on vaccines and his “misinformation and lies.” He’s not the first—and certainly not the last—federal employee to clash with his new boss.
Just days later, cuts at HHS reportedly began. Kennedy is expected to cut about a quarter of the department’s workforce, about 10,000 employees, across regional offices, the CDC, FDA, NIH, and the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare.
Job applications from federal workers are surging, Indeed reports. USDA workers and those working in DEI roles are likely hitting the job market the most, as searches for horticulture and employee relations roles increased by more than 10 times compared to this time last year. While most federal employees looking for work are still in the Washington, D.C. and Virginia area, Texas, California and Georgia are not far behind.

This March marked the 25th anniversary of the dotcom bust, a moment that serves as both a cautionary tale and a source of valuable lessons as we navigate the current artificial intelligence (AI) boom.  AI, much like the internet in the 1990s, is being hailed as the next transformative technology, with massive investment and sky-high valuations fueling excitement—and speculation. But if history is any guide, it may take longer than many expect for AI to reach its full potential, and there will be both winners and losers along the way.

As the co-founder of AOL, I had a front row seat to the Internet revolution. And I see several key lessons from that era that are relevant to the AI boom today. The lessons from the Internet and how they might inform the AI revolution are starting to become clear.  
Transformative technologies often take time to mature, but when the right conditions align, adoption can accelerate at an astonishing pace.  Policymakers must strike a delicate balance between fostering innovation and ensuring responsible oversight, as premature or excessive regulation can stifle progress. Meanwhile, market dynamics usually favor early adopters, but industry concentration in AI risks limiting opportunities for young startups. Finally, hype cycles are inevitable—overinvestment leads to corrections, but true breakthroughs endure. Together, these insights reinforce the need for strategic and surgical regulation, open access, and a steady hand in shaping AI’s future.
First, technology adoption takes time—but when it clicks, it moves fast. While AI may feel like an overnight success, its roots go back more than 70 years. The Internet too, has been in development for more than two decades when AOL became the first Internet company to go public, in 1992. 
AI has arguably taken longer to fully develop than the internet did, but because the world is now more interconnected, when ChatGPT launched it was able to get 100 million downloads in just three months. By comparison, it took AOL nine years to reach 1 million subscribers. AOL’s first funding round in 1985 was just $1 million; today, some AI startups are raising $1 billion, with not much more than an intriguing idea and an experienced team.
Second, AI’s rapid adoption is forcing policymakers to engage earlier than they did with the Internet. Yes, the government played a critical role in enabling the Internet to flourish.  Key decisions—such as the breakup of Ma Bell, which spurred competition in telecommunications, and Congress’ decision to open access to the internet to everyone—helped unleash the digital age. But because consumer adoption of the Internet was relatively gradual, the government could initially adopt a “wait and see” attitude, and a “light touch” in terms of regulations, while they monitored how it evolved and impacted our lives. 
But now, there is pressure to move quickly, especially given the “doomsday” scenarios that AI experts are understandably concerned about.  So coming to agreement sooner on appropriate guardrails is important. At the same time, we can’t let concerns about what might go wrong lead to stifling regulations that could hobble the many societal benefits of AI, or put at risk U.S. leadership of this highly strategic technology. It will be tricky, but we need to strike the right balance between responsible oversight and fostering continued rapid innovation. 
Third, during the internet boom, major corporations experimented with the nascent technology, but few took it seriously at first. Many of America’s largest and most valuable companies at the time—like GE and AT&T—dabbled in online strategies, but were not sure it would have broad appeal.  Their decision to largely stay on the sidelines created an amazing opportunity for a new generation of companies to emerge, including AOL, Yahoo, and many others.  But AI is different. The biggest tech companies, Microsoft, Google, Meta. Amazon, and others—are all in, and there’s now an arms race to dominate AI. This raises concerns for startups. Unlike during the early days of the Internet, the development of foundational AI platforms is largely concentrated in the hands of a few dominant firms. Open-source AI could help increase the likelihood of broader access and innovation. Without it, we risk AI enabling Big Tech to get bigger, and a new generation of disruptive startups could be left behind.
Fourth, hype and FOMO will inevitably lead to market corrections. In the late 1990s, the belief that ""the Internet will change everything"" drove sky-high valuations. That belief wasn’t wrong—the Internet did change everything. But not overnight, and not for every company.  When the bubble burst, many concluded that the Internet was a passing fad. Even within AOL Time Warner there were skeptics. In reality, the shakeout led to hundreds of companies falling by the wayside, but the strongest companies—Google and Amazon among them—really thrived.
AI is experiencing a similar hope and hype cycle. There’s a frenzy to invest early, reminiscent of the dotcom era, as investors don’t want to miss out on what is undoubtedly the next big thing.  But as with the Internet, not every AI startup will thrive; indeed, most won’t even survive. 
Still, the technological mega trend is real. The Internet led to a paradigm shift which changed all of our lives. AI will, as well. But fasten your seat belt, because if the dotcom bust is any indication, it will undoubtedly be a wild roller coaster ride.

Pete Townshend’s signature on-stage shoes were just re-released by Dr. Martens today, but this time with a major luxury upgrade. The lead guitarist of The Who was first spotted wearing the British footwear company’s 1460 boots during a performance in 1967, giving them the punk-rock platform they deserved and putting the brand on the mainstream map.

	Now, nearly 57 years later (and 65 years since the 1460s first appeared on the market), Dr. Martens is revamping the style for a more modern aesthetic. Called the “1460 Love Letter Boots,” this new drop is a special tribute to the original boots that were created in the counterculture decade, but are slightly adjusted for the digital age.



	“On April 1st, Dr. Martens will unveil a true collector’s item and one of the most premium iterations of the 1460 boot ever made, named the 1460 MIE Pascal Love Letter boot,” the brand said in the official press release. “It’s an homage to the enduring legacy of DM’s most famous silhouette, made at the brand’s original factory in Wollaston, Northamptonshire, England, where it all began. Only 1460 pairs will be produced — a nod to the boot’s name, which celebrates the date it was first made: April 1st, 1960.”





	$460.00



		The 1460 Love Letter Boots are a limited-edition silhouette released by Dr. Martens. They’re available in both men’s and women’s sizes, are crafted to perfection, and have intricate detailing on both the interior and upper, making them a unique selection that is built to last.	

	Retailing for $460 each, we don’t expect these one-of-a-kind boots to be in stock for long, so grab a pair while you still can. Whether you’re a Dr. Martens loyalist or just appreciate British pop-punk culture and want to emulate the style, these burgundy kicks are an investment worth making.

70,2025-04-01,"""One of our mandates is coming to an end""
75 people have been let go by Eidos-Montreal, the studio announced yesterday. The Deus Ex and Tomb Raider developers laid off the workers because they didn't have the ""capacity to entirely reallocate them"", according to a statement. It's a further blow to the workforce at the Embracer-owned company, following hefty cuts last year.
""Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members, as one of our mandates is coming to an end,"" said management in the post on LinkedIn. ""It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don’t have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services.
""These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market, and we are working to support them through this transition.""
The company doesn't specify what that ""mandate"" is. But it most likely means that work on a current project is finishing, for whatever reason. Note the classic use of not-our-fault spinlingo. The statement says the axed workers are ""going to enter the employment market"" rather than, say, being frogmarched there.
""Eidos-Montréal stays committed to deliver its other projects currently in development,"" they added.
The only project that the studio has publicly acknowledged they've been working on lately is the delayed Fable, on which they're helping out alongside core developer Playground Games. The company cancelled a Deus Ex game last year, and laid off 100 workers in the wake of that cancellation. We don't know what else they're doing right now. 
Eidos-Montreal was bought by Embracer Group in 2022, following the release of Guardians of the Galaxy the year before. Soon afterwards Embracer began a ruthless cost-cutting purge of workers across all its studios. In March last year, Embracer's CEO claimed this process of ""restructuring"" was over. But since then the multinational conglomerate has overseen the closure of the Gothic developers, the axing of 139 people from a Diablo IV support studio, and just last week other layoffs at Crystal Dynamics.

71,2025-04-01,"Payton Gendron's lawyers argue he can't get a fair trial in Western New York.
Payton Gendron, the teenager who killed 10 Black people at the Tops supermarket in East Buffalo in 2022, claims he cannot get a fair trial in Western New York, so his federal death-penalty eligible case should move to New York City, his attorneys said in a new court filing.
Gendron pleaded guilty in November 2022 to state charges, including domestic terrorism motivated by hate, and is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole. He faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted of federal crimes.
His federal trial is scheduled to begin in September.
Gendron's attorneys argued that ""due to the overwhelming amount of pretrial publicity, combined with the impact of this case on Buffalo's segregated communities of color, it is impossible for Payton Gendron to select a fair and impartial jury in the Western District of New York.""
The lawyers asked for change of venue to the Southern District of New York, encompassing Manhattan, the Bronx and the northern suburbs, because it is ""far enough from the local media market to be less impacted by it"" and because ""the S.D.N.Y. also has sufficient minority representation that has not been directly impacted by the shooting and its aftermath that a diverse and representative jury should be able to be selected.""
There was no immediate comment from federal prosecutors, who would be expected to file their opposition or consent in court papers.
Barbara Massey Mapps -- whose 72-year-old sister, Katherine ""Kat"" Massey, was among those killed in the May 14, 2022, massacre -- told ABC News on Tuesday that she and her family would oppose a change of venue.
""We don't want that. No, no no,"" said Massey. ""Me and my family would be against that.""
Massey said she expects federal prosecutors to oppose the change-of-venue motion at Gendron's next court date later this month.
Wayne Jones -- whose mother, 65-year-old Celestine Chaney, was also killed in the attack -- said he also wants Gendron's federal trial to remain in Buffalo.
""What could you really call a 'fair trial' and you're on video doing it?"" Jones told ABC News, referring to the livestream video of the killing rampage that Gendron recorded. ""We all know you did it. You already pleaded guilty once.""
Jones said he expects prosecutors to play for the federal jury selected for the trial the video Gendron recorded with a helmet camera, as well as surveillance video from the Topps market.
""The only way you could watch that video and not give him the death penalty is if you're really against it,"" said Jones, who has viewed the video Gendron live-streamed.
Jones also said a change of venue would deprive him and the families of the other victims of the opportunity of watching the trial in person.
“I want him to stay here so I can see the trial,"" Jones told ABC News. ""In New York City, we wouldn’t be able to go to the trial.""
Gendron has separately asked the judge to strike the death penalty as a possible punishment, arguing the decision to seek it had a ""discriminatory intent and discriminatory effect.""
The judge has yet to rule.
During his February 2023 sentencing hearing, Gendron, who was 18 when he committed the mass shooting, apologized to the victims' families, saying he was sorry ""for stealing the lives of your loved ones.""
""I did a terrible thing that day. I shot people because they were Black,"" Gendron said.
Gendron planned the massacre for months -- including previously traveling twice to the Tops store he targeted, a more than three-hour drive from his home in Conklin, New York -- to scout the layout and count the number of Black people present, according to state prosecutors. Wearing tactical gear, body armor, and wielding an AR-15 style rifle he legally purchased and illegally modified, Gendron committed the rampage on a Saturday afternoon when prosecutors said he knew the store would be full of Black shoppers.

Without technology like computers and the internet, remote work wasn't a possibility 100 years ago.

        In the 1920s, workers in major US cities commuted via buses, subways, ferries, streetcars, and automobiles.
    

        Getting to work has changed dramatically in cities like Los Angeles, which in the 1920s was home to the world's largest electric interurban trolley system. Today, the streetcars have been replaced by highways clogged by private vehicles.
    

        New York City, however, still uses the same subway system built over 120 years ago.
    

        Commuting has continued to evolve since the COVID-19 pandemic. While some companies are requiring employees to return to the office after years of working from home, a 2024 analysis by Stanford, WFH Research, and Gusto found that workers now live nearly three times further from their offices than they did before the pandemic because of the rise of remote work.
    

        Here's what commuting looked like in three major US cities 100 years ago.

73,2025-04-01,"US president says tariffs announcement on April 2 will be a ‘rebirth’ as trade uncertainty roils stock markets.
United States President Donald Trump has said his long-awaited reciprocal tariffs will be lower than what other countries charge as uncertainty over his biggest trade announcement yet continues to roil global stocks.
Speaking at the White House on Monday, Trump said the tariffs he is preparing to announce on Wednesday will be “nicer” than the trade policies of US trading partners.
“We are going to be very nice by comparison to what they were. The numbers will be lower than what they have been charging us, and in some cases, maybe substantially lower,” Trump told reporters at the Oval Office.
“Relatively speaking, we’re going to be very kind,” Trump said.
Repeating his regular talking point that the US has been taken advantage of by its trading partners, Trump said the measures would bring “tremendous wealth back to our country”.
“It’s really, in a sense, a rebirth of our country,” he said.
Trump’s remarks came a day after he clarified that the tariffs would apply to “all countries”, pouring cold water on hopes that the measures might only target countries responsible for the bulk of the US trade deficit.
 

 
“Just hours out from his big announcement, Trump and his team continue to give conflicting and inconsistent signals of what to expect,” Deborah Elms, the head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation in Singapore, told Al Jazeera.
“I am taking this latest statement with a grain of salt,” Elms added.
“I still expect that tariffs will be applied to almost everyone. With higher levels for those with higher trade deficits and other Trump complaints.”
Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement, which he has dubbed “liberation day”, is just the latest in a flurry of trade salvoes launched by the US president in recent weeks.
Many of the measures – including 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and a 25 percent duty on all auto imports – are set to go into effect this week.
Other tariffs – including a 20 percent duty on all Chinese imports and 25 percent duties on aluminium and steel – have been in place since last month.
US stocks had a mixed performance on Monday, after equities in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Australia earlier racked up sharp losses.
The benchmark S&P 500, which is down nearly 6 percent from the start of March, rose 0.55 percent.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite, which is down more than 8 percent, fell 0.14 percent.
Asian markets clawed back some losses on Tuesday morning, with Japan’s Nikkei 225, South Korea’s KOSPI, Australia’s ASX200 and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng up by between 0.41 percent and 0.76 percent as of 1:30 GMT.
 

 
While Trump has talked up his April 2 tariff announcement for weeks, the scope and specifics of his plans have remained vague.
Though Trump often expressed his support for blanket tariffs during his election campaign, senior officials in his administration have indicated that specific countries are of particular concern.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month that the administration was particularly focused on what he termed the “Dirty 15” – the 15 percent of countries deemed to account for the bulk of trade imbalances while imposing steep tariffs and other non-tariff barriers.
While Bessent did not mention any countries by name, the US has some of its biggest trade deficits with China, the European Union, Canada, India, Japan, Vietnam and South Korea.
Kevin Hassett, the director of Trump’s National Economic Council, suggested last month that officials were particularly looking at 10 to 15 countries that account for the bulk of the US trade deficit.
In an interview with Fox News on Sunday, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said the tariffs could raise $600bn annually, which would imply a rate of about 20 percent, going by US imports valued at about $3 trillion.
In a potential clue as to Trump’s next moves, the Office of the US Trade Representative on Monday released a list of policies and regulations in dozens of countries that it considers barriers to trade.
The report outlined tariff rates and non-tariff barriers, such as food safety regulations and green energy rules, for China, the EU, Canada, Argentina, Mexico and the United Arab Emirates, among other trade partners.
While Trump has argued that his tariffs will boost manufacturing and create jobs in the US, economists have warned that the measures are likely to upend global supply chains and lead to higher prices for consumers.
The US president’s trade salvoes have stoked tensions with some of Washington’s closest allies, including Canada, Japan and the EU.
On Monday, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said in an interview with French radio that Europe should “take greater control of our destiny” and a “step towards independence” in the face of Trump’s trade moves.

Multi-processor payment architectures are becoming more widespread, fueled by merchants' growing desire for payments flexibility and adaptability. Consider that 64% of US headquartered merchants with half or more of their sales occurring online indicate their organization prefers to work with multiple payment processors, according to 451 Research, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence. This is creating a need for capabilities to optimize results and, importantly, abstract complexity. Payment orchestration targets this market opportunity and has quickly become one of the most prolific and important merchant acceptance trends of the past half decade.
The acceleration of e-commerce is creating a greater need for payment connectivity
Payment orchestration encompasses approaches targeted at enhancing the reach, adaptability and performance of a multi-processor payments stack (e.g., using more than one payment processor). Once limited to only the biggest and most sophisticated global merchants with large in-house payments teams, dozens of vendors have emerged in recent years to help merchants outsource many if not all of the tasks associated with payment orchestration.
Vendors in this category offer services such as payment credential vaulting and tokenization, transaction routing, consolidated reporting, prebuilt gateway integrations, rules engines, optimizers (e.g., 3-D Secure, network tokens), and more. As the CTO of a $500M+ beauty retailer in the UK put it to us, payment orchestration platforms ""… allow the merchant to create efficiencies by managing and coordinating their payment stack and offering a unified view of their payments estate.""
Payment orchestration providers are coming at the opportunity from multiple different angles, including:
Payments are becoming more global, more complex and more strategic. These factors bode well for the opportunity for payment orchestration. Looking ahead, we see several key trends defining the market.
Recent moves by Stripe and Checkout.com to enable multi-processor support demonstrate that payment service providers are looking to position themselves as more flexible and accommodating suppliers in the eyes of large merchants. A key advantage of this strategy is expanding the market opportunity for their value-added services portfolios, as Stripe has done with Billing and Radar. This creates a larger market opportunity for PSPs to sell certain capabilities as standalone products, especially to enterprises that may not be ready to leave their incumbent processor. This then opens the door to upselling payment processing to those customers down the road. We expect multi-processor support to be offered more widely by PSPs and incumbent processors in coming years.
We believe there could be a larger market opportunity for orchestration beyond payment processing. Adjacent categories such as fraud prevention, digital identity, logistics and open banking are all possible areas where payment orchestration platforms can broaden their role and value for merchants. Spreedly, for example, has already begun moving in this direction with its open payments platform vision.
In recent years there have been some signs of consolidation. The first four notable deals in the space — PayU's acquisition of ZOOZ Mobile (2018), Payoneer's purchase of optile (2019), Checkout.com's reach for ProcessOut (2020) and MangoPay's pickup of WhenThen (2023) — involve payment service providers getting into orchestration. However, TokenEx's acquisition of IXOPAY last April bucks the trend and indicates that other types of buyers aspire to participate more directly in this sector. We anticipate an uptick in payment orchestration M&A between now and the end of the decade given the number of subscale payment orchestration providers that will likely need an exit in the next 24 months. We also anticipate new entrants — PSPs, tokenization vendors and even large IT infrastructure providers — to consider making inroads inorganically by reaching for market leaders.
Payment orchestration providers have a key role to play in helping merchants unify their payments data estate and deliver actionable guidance on their business. This remains a major challenge for many merchants. As the VP of e-commerce at a North American fashion retailer put it to us, ""Right now, we don't have good data on how different payment methods are being used. Payment analyses are manual and one-off, leading to challenges identifying opportunities and road map priorities.""
Players like Pagos have emerged to address this opportunity directly, but we believe orchestration platforms will have a seat at the table as well. However, this could require orchestration providers to shift to a more modular approach where capabilities like analytics can stand alone independent from their platform. Advancements in areas like generative AI will have an obvious role to play in deepening capabilities in this arena.
Further, vendors have an opportunity to harness data across their merchant networks to deliver enhanced intelligence to merchants on their routing and retry strategies. While merchants may not be comfortable having an orchestration provider making all decisions on their behalf, actionable recommendations can be surfaced in dashboards to help fine tune acceptance outcomes."

78,2025-04-01,"Clip your overalls, put on your caps, and strap in: Nintendo’s big Switch 2 reveal is finally upon us. Below you can find out how to watch the Switch 2 Direct and everything else you should know about Nintendo’s plans for the new console this week. 
The Mario maker gave us a brief tease of the Switch successor earlier this year but the April 2, 2025 showcase will be a full-blown Nintendo Direct that hopefully answers all of our big questions about the upcoming hardware, including if it’s shipping in June as currently rumored. A sneak peak of what looked like Mario Kart 9 was also shown earlier this year, but Tuesday’s Nintendo Direct will likely include lots of other games fans can expect at launch and in the months after. 
The Switch 2 Direct will be streaming live on YouTube, which means you can easily watch it via the video embedded below wherever you get your internet. The feed is scheduled to go live at 9:00 a.m. ET on April 2 and Nintendo recently confirmed the entire show will run approximately 60 minutes. That’s about how long the big presentation for the original Switch was back in 2016. 
Read More: Everything We Saw At The Big Switch 2 Reveal
The company has promised a “closer look at Nintendo Switch 2.” What exactly does that mean? Well, for starters fans will be hoping to get specifics on the price, release date, and when pre-orders go live. Analysts have currently predicted a price of $400-450, with a release date rumored for June 3 and pre-orders potentially going live on April 9 at big retailers. Another big question will be whether the new hardware is powerful enough to play Elden Ring. We currently don’t know anything official about the Switch 2's internal specs. 
Since we’ve already gotten a taste of the new Mario Kart game, it’s a good bet that will be delved into more deeply during the showcase. With Mario Kart 8 Deluxe being the best selling game on Switch, it would make sense for the sequel to be a launch game for the Switch 2. We might see new modes, online features, and additional characters added to the racing franchise’s roster. Hopefully, MK9 has a fresh gameplay gimmick as well (like making it an RPG). 
Other possibilities are Metroid Prime 4 and Pokémon Legends: Z-A. While both are confirmed Switch games, they also seem like easy candidates for Switch 2 Edition upgrades that Nintendo has previously hinted at. More exciting is the prospect of big sequels to Nintendo’s other franchises getting revealed, like a new 3D Mario game, a successor to Animal Crossing: New Horizons, or a sixth entry in the 2D side-scrolling Donkey Kong Country series. Given Microsoft’s new multiplatform strategy and Sony bringing Lego Horizon Adventures to Switch, it’s assumed both console rivals might have ports of older games to announce during the stream. 
The Switch 2 Direct isn’t the only Nintendo event happening this week. Nintendo’s in-house events team will be holding a Treehouse Live on YouTube on April 3 and April 4 with more deep-dives into the games shown during the April 2 showcase. Similar to previous Treehouse events, we’ll likely get explanations of new game features, interviews with Nintendo developers, and lots of new gameplay footage to analyze. 
The Thursday show will be four hours long followed by a shorter three hour livestream on Friday. April 4 is also when select fans in New York and elsewhere will get to go hands-on with the Switch 2 and some of its launch games. Insider Gaming reported that media and content creators will be going hands-on with the Switch 2 sometime this week as well.
Modern video game consoles all seem to have a knack for selling out at launch, so diehard fans will want to lock-in their pre-orders as quickly as possible. So far, we haven’t heard anything official from Nintendo about when players will be able to pre-order the Switch 2 ahead of its launch. A now-deleted post from Walmart Canada suggested pre-orders would go live on April 2 around 10:00 a.m. ET immediately following the Switch 2 Direct.
Read More: Switch 2 Pre-Order Rules Are Some BS: Here’s How They Work
Other sources have suggested one full week later  is when pre-orders will actually become available. Documents obtained from a “large U.S. retailer” at Insider Gaming suggested April 9 is the date for pre-orders, though it’s unclear if that is just for some retailers and not all. Companies often allot various amounts of stock to different stores, which can then sell it on their own timelines. 
The safest way to be prepared for whatever actually happens is to be logged into Target, GameStop, Amazon and others as soon as the Switch 2 Direct ends just in case pre-orders do go live immediately after the event. 
Update 4/2/25 4:31 p.m. ET: Added pre-order information and Treehouse Live schedule.

Convicted JPMorgan fraudster Charlie Javice will have a tougher time teaching Pilates, at least for now.

        US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein ruled Tuesday that Charlie Javice mustwear a GPS ankle monitor in the weeks prior to her August sentencing, at which she faces a possible maximum of 30 years in prison.
    

        He also invited Javice's legal team to return to him with a revised bail package and new arguments.
    

        ""Come up with a package,"" he advised, after suggesting he would consider ditching the ankle monitor if some other constraints — including an electronically monitored home curfew — were offered.
    

        ""If you come up with a successful package you would be able to change the terms,"" he said.
    

        Javice, 33, teaches Pilates in Miami Beach, where she and her mother live in the same waterfront apartment building. In her previous career, she founded Frank, a website that helped students fill out their federal financial aid forms.
    

        A jury found on Friday that Javice used fake data to trick JPMorgan, the country's largest bank, into believing her website had gathered the names and other personal data of more than 4 million students. The bank had hoped to market checking accounts and credit cards to these students, but later found that Javice had data for fewer than 300,000 of them.
    

        The judge's ankle monitor decision on Tuesday followed some 90 minutes of arguments in federal court in Manhattan — complete with court exhibits showing Javice teaching Pilates.
    

        In arguing against the ankle monitor, Javice's lawyer, Ron Sullivan, told the judge that Javice has never missed a day of court and is not a flight risk.
    

        Wearing the bulky device once again — as she had for several weeks before a November decision granting its removal — would be a severe impediment to her career as a Pilates instructor, Sullivan said.
    

        ""To have your legs in the air and the monitor going up and down on your leg — it is a significant encumbrance,"" Sullivan told the judge. The lawyer held both arms aloft and waved them back and forth to demonstrate as he stood at a podium.
    

        While wearing an ankle bracelet previously, she was only able to teach lessons briefly, and for family and friends, Sullivan said.
    

        Her classes require ""demanding physical movement and full flexibility and range of motion, specifically around her feet and ankles,"" her lawyers argued in court filings earlier Tuesday.
    

        ""Ms. Javice's services are sought after because her instruction is particularly challenging and dynamic,"" the filing said.
    

        In Hellerstein's courtroom, an assistant US attorney countered that an ankle bracelet is necessary now that Javice, who holds dual French-US citizenship, has been convicted.
    

        ""We would be well within our rights to seek remand,"" said the prosecutor, Georgia V. Kostopoulos.
    

        ""And we understand that pretrial services would not be opposed to that,"" she said, referring to the agency that handles post-conviction supervision.
    

        France does not have an extradition agreement with the United States, prosecutors have said.
    

        Hellerstein said that he had examined a GPS ankle monitor earlier in the day.
    

        ""It's not heavy. It probably weighs a pound,"" he told the prosecutors and defense lawyers.
    

        ""So I don't know,"" he said. ""I accept what you say, that it's a restriction on her ability to do the advanced Pilates that she does.""
    

        Still, he added, ""I can't say there is no risk of flight."" 
    

        He briefly retreated to chambers — holding printouts of photos of Javice teaching — to think it over before deciding.
    

        The judge also required Javice's codefendant, Olivier Amar, to wear an ankle monitor. As with Javice, Amar's lawyers — who'd argued that a monitor ""is quite large"" and ""makes him a pariah"" — were invited to pitch the judge an alternate bail package.
    

        Amar is free on a $1 million bond. Javice is free on a $2 million bond. The judge required both to be fitted with ankle monitors before leaving the courthouse on Tuesday.

The total market cap of the 14 U.S.-listed bitcoin (BTC) miners tracked by JPMorgan (JPM) dropped 25% in March, the third-worst monthly performance on record, the Wall Street bank said Tuesday.
Only one stock, Stronghold Digital Mining (SDIG), outperformed bitcoin (BTC) last month, the report noted. Bitfarms (BITF) completed its acquisition of the company on March 17. Miners with high performance computing (HPC) exposure underperformed pure-play miners for the second month in a row.
""We note valuations today are at the lowest levels relative to the block reward since the collapse of FTX in the Fall of 2023,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote.
The average network hashrate inched higher during the month to 816 exahashes per second (EH/s), the report said. The hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain, and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty.
Mining revenue and profitability both fell. 
""We estimate bitcoin miners earned an average of $47,300 per EH/s in daily block reward revenue in March, down 13% from February,"" the bank said. Daily block reward gross profit dropped 22% month-on-month to $23,000 per EH/s.
Stronghold Digital outperformed the sector last month with a 2% decline. Cipher Mining (CIFR) underperformed with a 45% slump.

From the BLS: Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary 
The number of job openings was little changed at 7.6 million in February, the U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistics reported today. Over the month, hires and total separations held at 5.4 million and 5.3 million, 
respectively. Within separations, quits (3.2 million) and layoffs and discharges (1.8 million) changed 
little. 
emphasis added
The following graph shows job openings (black line), hires (dark blue), Layoff, Discharges and other (red column), and Quits (light blue column) from the JOLTS. 

This series started in December 2000.

Note: The difference between JOLTS hires and separations is similar to the CES (payroll survey) net jobs headline numbers. This report is for February; the employment report this Friday will be for March.

 Click on graph for larger image.

Note that hires (dark blue) and total separations (red and light blue columns stacked) are usually pretty close each month. This is a measure of labor market turnover.  When the blue line is above the two stacked columns, the economy is adding net jobs - when it is below the columns, the economy is losing jobs.

The spike in layoffs and discharges in March 2020 is labeled, but off the chart to better show the usual data.

Jobs openings decreased in February to 7.57 million from 7.76 million in January.
The number of job openings (black) were down 10% year-over-year. 

Quits were down 8% year-over-year.  These are voluntary separations. (See light blue columns at bottom of graph for trend for ""quits"").

87,2025-04-01,"Kevin Mahn, president and CIO of Hennion & Walsh Asset Management, spoke with NYSE (ICE) TV for a special video interview.
Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below, which has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
KRISTEN SCHOLER: Joining me now in the studio is Kevin Mahn, president and chief investment officer at Hennion and Walsh Asset Management. Kevin, always good to have you, and especially here as we start this second quarter together.
KEVIN MAHN: Yes, happy April Fool’s Day.
KS: Happy April Fool’s Day as well. I know you always come with the facts. So give us the facts here as we start the second quarter. Kevin, where do we stand in the markets?
KM: Yeah. I think a lot of investors will be happy to see that March is now behind us and the first quarter is now behind us, as the stock market experienced its worst March and its worst first quarter since 2022. However, I think there are four things that could happen, Kristen, in the second quarter that could help allow for a strong second half of the year.
First and foremost, tariffs. We’re going to have more certainty, at least around what the tariffs will be so that we can plan and adjust our portfolios accordingly. Perhaps the reciprocal tariffs won’t be as reciprocal as we earlier thought that would be a tailwind for the markets. If the Federal Reserve does cut interest rates for the first time during the second quarter by 25 basis points, that would be a tailwind for the markets. If the tax cuts get extended during the second quarter, that would be a tailwind for the markets. 
And of course, the more and more announcements we hear about increases in defense spending and increases in AI infrastructure spending are tailwinds for the markets as well. So I know this volatility is hard to deal with, but try not to time the market. Stay invested true to your risk tolerance. Adjust your portfolios accordingly and be rest assured that the markets will come back. And when they do, they tend to bounce back just as strongly as they move downward.
KS: So in this environment, Kevin, certainly it sounds like a buy and hold perhaps is what you’re recommending to your clients. But for viewers who are watching and looking at the volatility that we’ve seen, at least to start the year, is there any sort of reallocating that you might suggest amid some of the sector rotation?
KM: Sure. I would say hold and adjust, because numerous studies show that timing in the market is an exercise in futility. But if you could look into those areas of the market that are benefiting right now, value is significantly outperforming growth. International is outperforming U.S. Defense stocks, industrials, utilities. How about utility stocks? They pay a good dividend. They hold up well in the face of volatility, and they are a backdoor play into the AI revolution. That’s a sector you might wanna look at. And of course, bonds. Bonds can provide you with that principle protection when you hold them to maturity and a good steady stream of income. And they’re also pretty, volatility-wise, strong as well.
KS: I do want to talk about the Fed and the path forward for interest rates because we had heard from Fed chair Jerome Powell toward the end of the first quarter that yes, he sees more uncertainty and, you alluded to it, the market does not like uncertainty. It wants clarity. But the Fed did hold pat on his interest rate stance, seeing two cuts this year. In the past week, several guests have come on the show and they actually think rates might rise this year due to inflation. Give us a better sense as to what makes up your particular outlook on rates.
KM: The only thing that’s certain right now is that there is more uncertainty ahead, but Chairman Powell did reiterate that he stands ready to step in if the economy deteriorates further or the job market worsens. They still have two rate cuts forecast for this year. However, they also increased their outlook for inflation, they increased their outlook for unemployment, and they lowered their forecast for GDP. Put that all together, that’s a recipe for potential stagflation. But I do think the Fed continues to cut rates this year on a more gradual pace because they’re more concerned about an economic slowdown potentially becoming a recession than they are with inflation staying above their target 2%.
KS: We had heard the Fed share use that word “transitory” again.
KM: Again, it’s back! It’s back! Maybe these inflationary pressures related to tariffs are indeed transitory, but we’ll learn more about these tariffs tomorrow.
KS: Now, of course, the jobs report is due out on Friday. We’ve seen a wave of layoffs, at least just focusing on the federal government with DOGE, tens of thousands of them, if not more, at this point. What does that mean for the jobs report?
KM: Well, the Fed updated their forecast for unemployment this year to end the year at about 4.4%, and they think it will come down slightly next year to about 4.3%. Now, from a historical standpoint, that’s not very high, but from where we are right now, that means hundreds of thousands of other Americans are gonna be out of work. That’s a concern because Americans who are out of work don’t tend to spend as much as Americans who do work, and 70% of our economic growth comes from consumer spending, so it’s something to pay a close attention to.
KS: Next week, earnings season will start to kick off. Delta (DAL) among the first companies to report should give us a good sense as to the health of the consumer when it comes to discretionary travel spend. Any expectations there?
KM: As it stands right now, if you look at FactSet (FDS), they’re forecasting 7%-plus year-over-year earnings growth. That would mark the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth. I think that will come down a little bit, but if we can continue to have companies grow their earnings amidst this stock market pullback, that creates some pretty attractive entry points. The Mag Seven itself is currently trading at 25 times current earnings. That’s the lowest it’s been since the end of 2022. There are investment opportunities out there to consider as a result of the pullback we’ve seen.
KS: I also want ask about international stocks because we knew, or at least it was broadcast, when President Donald Trump took office for a second term: American exceptionalism. In some ways, that’s sort of replaced MAGA, obviously. He’s always, you know, catered to the MAGA base. It helps him get elected. But American exceptionalism, as we see international stocks outperform. How should a viewer look at that? Should they remain true to American exceptionalism, if that’s the ideology that they’ve adopted? Or should they be open to international investments?
KM: I think what we’ve seen so far in 2025 is a reminder to investors about the potential benefits of diversifying your portfolio geographically. International developed markets have significantly outperformed the rest of the world. Even emerging markets have outperformed the U.S. to date, but we’re still overweight U.S. A lot of this transition period is creating this uncertainty, creating this volatility, but ultimately, I think the U.S. comes out stronger as a result. So that doesn’t necessarily mean you abandon U.S. stocks because international’s outperforming, but you should consider adding them to a geographically balanced portfolio.
KS: Bitcoin. We’re gonna end with a Bitcoin question, Kevin. What are your thoughts?
KM: Yeah, my thoughts are, I still don’t understand it. I don’t understand why it moves higher or lower on a given day. I understand the Trump administration is behind cryptocurrencies and behind Bitcoin. But I think there are better opportunities in the market on a risk-adjusted basis than Bitcoin. But I still like the underlying technology that it’s built on, that being blockchain.

Even though Amazon’s Big Spring Sale ended yesterday, that doesn’t mean you won’t find great discounts on top TVs at other retailers. In fact, we came across this fantastic offer on a big LG TV not too long ago:
For a limited time, when you purchase the LG 70-inch UQ7070 Series 4K LED at Walmart, you’ll only pay $500. Usually, this TV sells for $650.

While it may not be one of the more exciting TV deals we’ve dug up this week, it’s an excellent buy for anyone looking to score the biggest screen size they can get without spending an arm and a leg. It’s also a solid TV for watching movies and shows and even for playing video games. LG’s a5 Gen 5 AI Processor does a nice job at enhancing and upscaling all sources, so even older content looks bright, colorful, and polished. 
The UQ7070 only has a native 60Hz refresh rate, but LG’s built-in Game Optimizer makes it easy to adjust crucial gameplay settings in a pinch, making the UQ7070 a reliable console and PC gaming display. This LG TV also features LG’s webOS 22 for access to streaming apps and casting capabilities. 
This isn’t the most advanced TV on the market, but if you’re looking to score a great deal on a 65-inch set or larger, it’s hard to go wrong with any LG TV. 
Save $150 when you purchase the LG 70-inch UQ7070 Series 4K LED, and be sure to take a look at our lists of the best LG TV deals and best Walmart deals for even more discounts on popular LG sets! 

You don’t have to spend thousands of dollars to get a new TV, especially if you’re only looking to replace a secondary set. Or maybe you’re buying a gift and need a cheap TV recommendation? Whatever the case may be, we’re pleased to announce that the Insignia 50-inch F30 Series 4K LED is on sale today:
Right now, when you purchase this TV at Amazon or Best Buy, you’ll only pay $190. The full MSRP on this model is $350, which means you’ll be saving $110.
Springtime is a great season to go hunting for TV deals, and it’s a longstanding tradition here at Digital Trends to hang the best QLED offer of the week over the fireplace mantle. As luck would have it, we came across this fantastic Samsung offer that more than fits the bill:
For a limited time, the Samsung 65-inch QNX1D 4K QLED is available through Samsung for only $1,150. The full MSRP on this model is $2,200, so you know we’re not kidding when we say things like “cash going back in your pocket.” We’re also a big fan of this TV for several reasons!
Sony’s best TV in 2024 was actually a QLED TV that we had the opportunity to test. We’re referring to the Bravia 9, a premium LED-LCD that delivers terrific picture quality and some of the most arresting peak brightness performance we’ve ever seen from a Sony set. And right now when you purchase the Sony 65-inch Bravia 9 Series 4K QLED at Amazon, Best Buy, B&H Photo-Video, and a few other retailers, you’ll only pay $2,500.
The full MSRP on this model is $3,000, which means you’ll be saving yourself $500 when you buy it ASAP.

89,2025-04-01,"We’ve seen plenty of innovation when it comes to PC case fan aesthetics, but a company named Coolify seems to have raised the bar. Their latest ‘Holo Fans’ bring animated holograms to desktop setups, adding a striking visual element that goes far beyond simple LED effects.
Unlike conventional RGB fans, which rely on LED lighting for aesthetic appeal, Coolify’s Holo Fans project dynamic 3D holograms at their center, creating a floating visual effect while the fans spin. The technology utilizes an array of 96 LEDs to generate the illusion of depth, allowing users to display logos, animations, and even customizable graphics. This makes them the first case fans to integrate full holographic projection, setting a new standard for PC personalization.
Coolify’s Holo Fans are available in both 120mm and 140mm sizes and come with a dedicated controller to manage animations and lighting effects. The fans also support software integration, enabling users to synchronize visuals with system metrics such as CPU temperature, fan speeds, or gaming performance indicators. Additionally, the holograms can be adjusted to display system alerts or real-time notifications, adding a functional edge to their futuristic aesthetics.
Beyond their visual appeal, the fans are claimed to offer good cooling performance. They feature high-static pressure designs for efficient airflow, offering speeds of up to 2,600 rpm, fan airflow of 52 CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) and a rated air pressure of 2.75 mmH2O. Coolify has also designed the fans with quiet operation in mind, and claims noise levels of just 33dB(A) making them suitable for both gaming rigs and workstation setups. Notably, the power consumption is on the higher side ranging between 2W to 6W but can go up to 10W.
While RGB lighting has been a staple in PC customization for years, the introduction of holographic displays pushes personalization to a whole new level. Instead of static lighting effects or basic animations, these fans deliver an immersive, eye-catching experience that was previously unheard of in PC cooling solutions.
The Coolify Holo Fans were originally announced last year but it seems that you can finally purchase one for $45.99, though initial stock is expected to be limited due to high demand.
It’s no secret that Apple’s products are among the best designed devices in the tech industry. Just one peek at the MacBook Pro or the iPhone 16 Pro and you know that you’re looking at quality.
There’s a reason for that, and it’s got nothing to do with blind luck. No, Apple’s design philosophy has long been to strip away the unnecessary elements of a device until you’re left with only the essential components. There should be nothing extraneous, no needless fluff. Instead, the product should be the core expression of a concept, such as a phone or a computer. That has led to some of its best designs.
The increasing prevalence of chatbots like ChatGPT has lead to difficulties in schools and colleges as professors try to figure out how to balance students' use of AI with their need for learning. Now, Anthropic is rolling out a new tool it hopes will be a positive step in the use of AI for both students and teachers: a version of the Claude chatbot specifically designed for use in educational environments.
Claude for Education, launched on April 2, features a Learning mode which encourages users to reason their way through a question rather than just giving them an answer. The tools works in the Projects format, where students can look through their previous research arranged by particular assignments.

A new executive order signed by President Trump Monday aims to hit all the right notes with concertgoers by addressing the price-gouging of tickets for live events.
It orders the Federal Trade Commission to ensure price transparency at all stages of ticket buying and the Attorney General to ensure that ticket scalpers are abiding by the law and Internal Revenue Code. The executive order claims it will double down on enforcing the Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act, which targets scalpers who use bots to purchase tickets and resell them at much higher prices—profiting the scalper instead of the artist.

“It is a big problem,” Trump said during a signing ceremony in the Oval Office, claiming that the new executive order would be a step towards lowering “crazy ticket prices.” 
Kid Rock stood next to the commander-in-chief in a red-white-and-blue jumpsuit emblazoned with the American flag.
“I want the fans to have fair ticket prices, to be able to go enjoy more shows,” said the Grammy-nominated artist, whose real name is Robert James Ritchie. “I’d like to take my ticket price lower, but if I set my ticket prices low, these bots immediately eat them up, and they resell for hundreds of dollars more, and I’m just making these bad actors rich.” 
Trump’s executive order comes after the administration of his predecessor Joe Biden sued Ticketmaster last year, accusing it of running an illegal monopoly over live events. 
The New York Times recently reported on the growing number of Gen Z concertgoers who are willing to go into debt in order to see their favorite performers. In 1996, the average ticket for a top 100 tour went for about $25, while today average ticket prices are about $135, per Pollstar, a trade publication that covers the live music industry. The issue of price-gouging gained new attention in the last couple of years when tickets for Taylor Swift’s Eras tour sold for tens of thousands of dollars. 
In a statement published by Variety, leading ticket reseller StubHub railed against what it called the ""live entertainment monopoly"" and commended Trump for ""taking steps to better protect fans from ticket bots and bad actors who exploit vulnerabilities in the primary ticket market."" Live Nation Entertainment, Ticketmaster’s parent company, issued a press release thanking Trump for signing the executive order, stating, “We support any meaningful resale reforms,” including “caps on resale prices.”
The executive order does not get into caps. Music industry analyst Bob Lefsetz called the executive order “grandstanding” in his newsletter, arguing, “In reality the order says nothing. Other than ticket scalpers make a lot of money and they must pay taxes on their revenue.” He wrote that the BOTS act has been rarely used because not enough money has been delegated to enforce it and expressed doubt that such funds would be allocated given the new Department of Government Efficiency’s efforts to reduce government spending.

Greed wins. Than many act surprised when it happens.

When Donald Trump was elected president, businesses across the country were broadly optimistic about what the next four years would look like. As an avowed enemy of regulatory red tape, it was believed the Trump Administration would open doors for faster development, bigger deals and less government interference. Continuing tax cuts from his first term, set to expire in 2025, would give businesses more capital. And with inflation coming under control, interest rates consistently seeing cuts and a booming stock market at the end of 2024, this year was supposed to be a golden time for deals, innovation, revenue growth and new ideas.
So far, that’s not how things have turned out. Since taking office, Trump has gone bold and deep with new policy proposals, some of which have caused widespread alarm among economists, investors, foreign governments and U.S. residents. Trump’s insistence on deep new tariffs, some of which are scheduled to start tomorrow, have caused the most widespread economic anxiety. And with turmoil and uncertainty, businesses cannot move forward with their plans. Forbes’ Hank Tucker writes that the M&A boom that everyone had predicted just isn’t happening so far this year, largely because it’s difficult for companies to see what lies ahead, finance-wise.
“The perceived chaos around policy is causing a degree of paralysis and delay,” Mike Mayo, a managing director and head of large bank research at Wells Fargo Securities, told Tucker. “The bull case is easy to articulate, but that’s been around for enough months now that investors are getting impatient. If it’s July 4 and we’re still having this discussion, then this capital markets cycle could be driven into a ditch.”
But Mitch Berlin, EY Americas vice chair for Strategy and Transactions, told me earlier this year that he’s confident the deals will happen.
“People are waiting for the dust to settle, and then we’ll move forward,” Berlin said. “There’s a lot of pent-up demand. We know from the investment bankers and clients we work with that the pipeline is there.”
In the meantime, with Trump’s big “Liberation Day” tariff announcement tomorrow and a new 25% tariff on imported vehicles and parts going into effect, it may get pretty dusty soon.
Fraud is a growing concern throughout the business world, with 90% of all companies reporting being targeted in 2024, according to a study from payment fraud protection company Trustpair. I talked to Trustpair Cofounder and CEO Baptiste Collot about how financial leaders can do a better job of catching fraud attempts. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.
A trader on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday morning.
Trump’s tariff talk is keeping the market roller coaster going. The markets began last week on a more positive note, as White House conversation about tariffs made it sound like they would not be quite so devastating. Then Trump announced the vehicle tariffs after markets closed on Wednesday, tanking stocks last Thursday.
On Friday, the federal government released February’s personal consumption expenditures index and found core inflation, excluding food and fuel, was 2.8% compared to last year. This is not only higher than the Federal Reserve’s target of 2% inflation but slightly more than economists’ expectations of 2.7%. From January to February the PCE price index increased 0.3%, while the core index was up 0.4%. Considering many economists have predicted tariffs can drive inflation up, these figures a week before rates are announced and new tariffs go into effect do not sound promising, and the markets fell more.
This week started on a low economic note. Stocks worldwide fell Monday following Trump’s Sunday comments that there would be no exceptions when it comes to reciprocal tariffs, closing out March as the worst month on the S&P 500 since 2022, and tallying losses on the other two major indexes as well. A Sunday client note from Goldman Sachs upped its forecast for a recession in the next year to 35%, and Moody’s Investors Service, which was the last credit rating agency to give the U.S. the highest possible position, changed its outlook to negative, writes Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman.
Consumers are already predicting the worst. The University of Michigan’s monthly consumer sentiment survey showed consumers’ feelings about the current state of the economy dropped 12% to 57% in March, adding up to a 30% decline since November. Inflation expectations are also up to 5%, marking three consecutive months of increases. An AP-NORC poll taken March 20-24 found that 60% of U.S. adults disapprove of Trump’s handling of trade.
The entrance to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau headquarters on February 10.
Even though the Trump Administration has made its disdain for financial regulators clear—especially through its evisceration of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau—that department and its mission still live on. Since the agency was created by Congress in 2011, only Congress can shut it down—something unlikely to happen, given the slim Republican majorities in both chambers. Forbes’ Jeff Kauflin writes that a judge issued an injunction against mass firings or a bureau shutdown last week, and the bureau employees who are still there are quietly at work. Trump’s CFPB is likely to be much less active on the consumer protection front and is more likely to limit itself to statutorily required work.
While this looks great on its face for financial businesses wanting to move forward with fewer regulations, it’s possible that a more permissive CFPB will only last for a couple of years, until a new Congress or different administration can reinvigorate it, Kauflin writes. Experts are warning companies dealing with finance to continue to comply with the types of standards set by the Biden-era CFPB so they don’t find themselves in trouble if it does come back. Experts told Kauflin that state laws and regulators, as well as state attorneys general, are likely to continue to regulate financial institutions, meaning it won’t be a free-for-all. However, Columbia University business and law school senior fellow Todd Baker told Kauflin that the difference in regulation underscores a larger trend: financial regulation becoming politicized. “That ultimately hurts the regulatory system as a whole,” he said.
A Treasury Department employee holds a blank check before it's run through a printer in 2011.
The federal government is moving more into the 21st century—at least in terms of financial operations. As of September 30, the federal government will no longer issue paper checks, and will instead use direct deposit, prepaid cards or other digital payment options, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb. According to the executive order signed last week by President Trump, maintaining the physical infrastructure and specialized technology to digitize paper records cost taxpayers more than $657 million in FY 2024 alone. Unlike paper checks, digital transactions cannot be lost, stolen or altered. Erb writes the federal government tried to do this more than three decades ago when a provision in the 1991 federal budget required paper checks to be largely abandoned by 1999. The order goes both ways, Erb writes: Federal government agencies—including the Treasury, Health and Human Services, Education and Veterans Affairs—need to “expedite requirements” to receive digital payments as well.
Trustpair Cofounder and CEO Baptiste Collot.
Nine out of 10 companies were targeted by cyber fraud in 2024, according to a recent study from payment fraud protection company Trustpair. Payment fraud is especially notorious, with many companies unsure of the origin of invoices they pay. About 60% of companies lost more than $5 million to payment fraud last year, with 20% losing $25 million or more. I talked to Trustpair Cofounder and CEO Baptiste Collot about how CFOs and financial departments can catch more of these fraud attempts. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.
How equipped are CFOs and financial departments to be able to stop vendor payment fraud?
Collot: They’re not well equipped at all. They mainly believe that processes in place are enough, relying [on] people [to stop] it because people have been trained. But when you fight a cyber attack and gen AI with manual weapons, it’s not a fair battle. They’re not digitally equipped. 69% of companies use manual methods to handle bank account validations.
The manual method is basically a simple callback. You receive an invoice, you call the phone number on the invoice, or you receive an email and you call the phone number associated with the email. Very likely you are calling back the vendor—or the fraudster—who sent the information. It’s worse when you go international, when you have vendors everywhere in the world: different cultures, languages, time zones.
What should companies be doing to do a better job catching the fraudsters?
Replace manual processes with automation, especially bank account validation and bank account ownership. Validation for any vendor is absolutely critical. Equipping teams with digitalized tools all over the procurement and payment chain is absolutely critical to make sure that they don’t rely only on humans to control data, but they rely on automated controls, systematic controls everywhere in the payment chain, from the vendor onboarding to the treasury system.
And, of course, bringing new tools means you need to get your teams trained on these tools. You still need to make some awareness internally.
Is there anything that CFOs should watch for in general when they’re looking more closely for fraud?
They should think about how they can bring a solution that can break the silos over their own teams. The procure-to-pay process is complex with procurement, AP, vendors, master data team, treasury. The data is moving from one team to another until there is a payment. These silos are the biggest threat for companies when it comes to payment fraud because sometimes the fraud can be caught by one team, but then the data is used by other teams. Because of the lack of communication and tools and global platform within the company, they cannot capture fraud.
For sure, the CFO must think about how they will increase the collaboration among teams and make sure that they have tools that can be used by all the teams at the same time.
