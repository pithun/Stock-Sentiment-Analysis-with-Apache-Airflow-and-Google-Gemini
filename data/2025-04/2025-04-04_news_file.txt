0,2025-04-04,"As stock markets continue to tumble after the US imposition of sweeping and swingeing tariffs, many are asking does this qualify as a stock market ""crash"" and what that could mean for them.
The word crash has been used sparingly over the decades and is usually reserved for a fall of over 20% from a recent peak in a day, or over the course of a couple of days.
On 19 October, 1987 - also known as Black Monday - the US stock market lost 23% of its value in a single day, and other stock markets had similar falls. The UK FTSE index fell 23% over two days – partly because it closes earlier than New York, and so it often plays catch up with whatever happens in the US the next morning. 
That was most definitely a crash.
In 1929, the US stock market lost over 20% of its value in two days - and 50% within three weeks. That was the famous Wall Street Crash that ushered in the great depression of the 1930s.
By comparison, the US stock market has lost around 17% of its value from its peak in February and is now down 2% from where it was this time last year.

Nevertheless, these are the biggest and quickest declines we have seen in world markets since they were gripped by the panic of Covid-19 in early 2020.
A decline of 20% from a peak is considered a ""bear market"" - a description of a market that appears to be more likely to go down than go up. We are very close to that description right now.
While many people own stocks and shares directly, most people's exposure to stock markets come through their pension plans. There are two types – defined benefit schemes which guarantee a fixed pension income, and defined contribution where your pension pot rises and falls with financial markets.
That may sound like defined contribution plans are very vulnerable to this sell off – but not all of your contributions go into shares. Much of the money goes into safer investments such as government bonds. These tend to increase in value when stock markets fall as they are seen as a ""safe haven"" along with other assets such as gold. 
That is exactly what has happened here. 
Government bonds have risen in value and that can offset some or all of the fall in shares depending on how your pension savings are allocated.
The closer to retirement you are, the higher percentage of your pension pot is likely to be invested in bonds - so the less affected you will be.
There have been many falls like this in the decades since the Wall Street Crash but in the long term, shares have turned out to be a good investment – and pension savings is a long term game.
It does matter. A company's share value is a measure of how profitable those companies are expected to be in the future. A plummeting market is an indication that most people think that most companies are likely to see their profits fall.
The markets believe that US President Donald Trump's tariff bombshell is expected to raise prices, lower demand and reduce profits, making companies less valuable and more inclined to cut investment and jobs.
So the real warning sign here is not about the value of your pension but about the health of the economy in which we live and work.
Falls like this sometimes, often even, herald an economic downturn. That is more of a worry than the value of your pension, which has seen and will see volatility like this over the years.
But that's not to say this is not a very big moment for the world economy.

1,2025-04-04,"Bad news for Nintendo fans in the US who planned to preorder the Switch 2 on April 9: The company is delaying purchases for the console “in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions.” Although the launch date, June 5, remains the same, Nintendo says it will update preorder timing “at a later date.”
It’s an unprecedented move from any console maker, and a direct response to Wednesday’s news that President Donald Trump would institute sweeping tariffs; already the stock market has plummeted, prices on important goods are expected to rise, and the tech industry is reeling. Nintendo announced preorders for the console alongside its first event debuting the console to the press—the same day news of Trump’s tariffs hit.
The depth and breadth of the tariffs have been shocking, says video game analyst Mat Piscatella of market research firm Circana. “My best guess would be that Nintendo had some assumptions in place at what the tariffs would likely be, and that the announced tariffs came in much higher with wider reach than anticipated,” Piscatella tells WIRED.
It’s unclear whether the price of the Switch 2—$450, a tag that has already been upsetting to some fans—could rise even further. Piscatella says it’s not an impossibility. “Every reasonable and responsible business that relies on international supply chains will be reevaluating its US pricing at this point,” he says. “They have to.”
There’s been a great deal of speculation from industry analysts and institutions like the Entertainment Software Association about how harmful Trump’s tariffs would be to the video game market and industry. In February, the ESA issued a statement that tariffs would “negatively impact hundreds of millions of Americans and would harm the industry’s significant contributions to the US economy.” Nintendo’s announcement on Friday underscores just how disruptive the tariffs could end up being.
Piscatella says that historically other territories have been subjected to higher video game pricing already and “the US could certainly be joining that group.”
“The haphazard and chaotic nature of the tariffs and their announcement obviously has many scrambling to navigate the fallout,” Piscatella says.

2,2025-04-04,"
    New tariff policies have prompted a huge sell-off in the US stock markets and uncertainty for investors.
  
Plunging US stock prices have created much confusion for investors.
The long-term impact of the new US tariffs implemented by President Donald Trump may be uncertain, but the short-term effects have been obvious -- stock prices in the leading US markets are crumbling. 
After the new tariffs were announced late Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 1,647 points on Thursday and has fallen another 2,000 points, or nearly 5%, on Friday.
""It is very difficult for businesses to plan in this chaotic tariff environment created by the Trump administration,"" said Robert Johnson, CEO of Economic Index Associates and professor of finance at Creighton University's Heider College of Business. Markets usually react negatively to tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods that usually drive up prices for consumers and stifle global trade.
While escalating tariff threats are eroding both consumer and corporate confidence, cuts to the federal workforce are causing households to curb spending and sparking fears of a recession. ""This can result in an economic slowdown,"" Johnson said. 
A number of other factors are also contributing to stock market volatility, such as inflation, interest rate forecasts and fears of increased military conflict. Wall Street briefly rallied after the Fed kept its benchmark interest rate steady on March 19, but the forecast for higher inflation and lower economic growth in 2025 then sent stocks lower again. 
""The stock market is affected both by reality and perception,"" said Rick Miller, a financial and investment adviser at Miller Investment Management. ""What people believe is happening is often as impactful as what the actual market conditions may be."" 
Though a 10% dip in the stock market can be stressful, it's also pretty normal. The stock market has always recovered from steeper drops, including most recently the Great Recession and the COVID-19 meltdown. If you're nervous about your investments, like the state of your 401(k), financial experts say not to panic.
While it can be painful to watch your investments shrink, it's not always a safer bet to change your strategy, especially if you're several years away from retirement. If you're in your 30s to early 50s, time is on your side to ride this out and play the long game. 
However, if you're on the cusp of retiring or you plan to retire early, Miller said you may want to cash in your qualified plans to preserve what you've built over the years. 
Despite the stock market's historical track record of bouncing back after downturns, retirees (or those approaching retirement) may be unable to afford the time it takes to recover. For example, after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, the market began to gain steam, but then the 2007-09 financial crisis hit. The stock market didn't fully recover until 2013.
What's key is protecting your financial security. For example, as long as you don't withdraw money from your retirement accounts, selling assets within qualified workplace plans, like 401(k)s or IRAs, won't result in a tax bill no matter what your age. 
""Cushion the effects a bit by making your qualified plan contributions aggressive until the markets stabilize,"" Miller said. It's a way to benefit from upward momentum in the market while keeping your nest egg safe from any further drops.
Given the economy's broader problems, stocks are likely to bounce around a bit. Most financial advisers recommend against changing your strategy based on the latest stock market ups and downs.
""The best advice for long-term investors is to establish an investment plan and to stick to it,"" he said.
It's generally wise to avoid selling in a panic. By doing so, you could be going against the general guidance for investing, which is to buy low and sell high. 
Financial planners often recommend using what's called a dollar-cost averaging strategy, where you invest a set amount each month regardless of market conditions. This approach takes some of the emotion out of investing and allows you to lock in low prices during stock market dips, even if you pay more when the market surges.
Still, if you do choose to take advantage of lower prices, just keep in mind that the timing of a recovery is unpredictable. ""Even regular investors should consider 'buying low' when top quality companies experience price declines not seen for years,"" said Miller. "

Car companies are in panic mode as they scramble to respond to President Donald Trump’s 25 percent auto tariffs.
by  Andrew J. Hawkins
President Donald Trump’s 25 percent tariffs on all auto-related imports have been called “a debacle of epic proportions” and a sure-fire way to tank the auto market by crushing demand. Analysts have been predicting everything from $12,000 per vehicle price hikes to the possible “Cubanization” of the US car fleet.
Now that they’ve had a few days to process the news, the automakers are starting to get their ducks in a row and make some moves.
Here’s how each company is responding:
Now that the tariffs are in effect, the German automaker is holding all vehicles assembled in Mexico and overseas at US ports until further notice, according to Automotive News. Audi currently has 37,000 units in dealer stock and at port — which remain unaffected by the new import fees and are ready to sell. Audi reportedly said it would be marking unaffected units with a $0 “No Added Import Fee” option code for easy tracking.
“We are evaluating how to best proceed for our customers and our dealers,” Audi spokesperson Mark Dahncke said.
BMW hasn’t announced any specific response yet, but the company said last month that it expected a €1 billion hit to its 2025 earnings as a result of tariffs.
BMW spokesperson Phil DiIanni declined to comment, aside from sending a statement highlighting the automaker’s commitment to making cars in the US.
Ford was first out of the gate with a response geared toward people panic shopping, hoping to capitalize on pre-tariff sticker prices. The automaker launched a new program called “From America, For America” that offers employee pricing to everyone.
The promo runs April 3rd through June 2nd and offers “significant savings” on a number of 2024 and 2025 gas, hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and diesel Ford and Lincoln vehicles, according to the company. EV customers will get the discount on top of the Ford Power Promise deal, which extends through June 30th and includes a complimentary home charger. Excluded from the limited-time offer are Ford Raptor models, 2025 Expedition and Navigator SUVs, and Super Duty trucks.
“We understand that these are uncertain times for many Americans,” Ford says on its website. “Whether it’s navigating the complexities of a changing economy or simply needing a reliable vehicle for your family, we want to help.”
The discount may help Ford clear out some of its ample inventory, which stood at a 74-day supply of vehicles on its dealers’ lots at the end of March, compared to 50 days for GM, according to JP Morgan Global Research.
General Motors responded by telling employees at its assembly plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana, that it would increase production of light-duty trucks and add some temporary hourly workers to backfill for employees during summer vacation. The company is also considering shifting some of its truck production from Mexico to the US. GM is not making any physical upgrades to the plant, just adding additional temporary people to support it.
The Fort Wayne plant makes the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra trucks, which GM also manufactures at plants in Mexico and Canada. About half of GM’s large pickup truck production is done in Mexico and Canada, according to a recent Barclays report.
The Japanese automaker may not be merging with Nissan, but its already making moves to adjust to the tariffs. The company is planning on producing its next-generation Civic hybrid in Indiana instead of Mexico to avoid import duties, Reuters reported last month.
Meanwhile, Honda dealers are reassuring their customers that most of their most popular vehicles are made in the US. And spokesperson Chris Martin referred to the Autos Drive America trade group, which asserts that it is “impossible to rebuild those supply chains in a matter of weeks, especially with the added financial burden of tariffs.”
Hyundai gets the award for most “Trump-appeasing” announcement, with a commitment to spend $21 billion in the US (despite most of that investment already being underway). But while Trump was happy to brandish the announcement as proof his tariffs were working, the Korean automaker was also reportedly warning its dealers that prices could go up as a result of the new import duties.
“Hyundai Motor, including Kia, Hyundai and Genesis, remains committed to the long-term growth of the U.S. automotive industry through localized production and innovation,” spokesperson James Bell said in an email.
JLR is holding off on any immediate decisions, telling UK-based media that its local business remains “resilient.” But residents of the town where Jaguar operates its factory were dour about the news.
“I’m appalled. It will kill Jaguar Land Rover here in the town,” one resident told The Guardian. “There could potentially be job losses because JLR export enormously to America. The knock-on effect is going to be enormous.”
The luxury automaker is reportedly considering pulling its least expensive models, like its entry-level GLA, from the US market, Bloomberg said. But no decisions have been made yet, as spokesperson Amanda Painter said that Mercedes-Benz was still “currently assessing the impact of the US-tariff lines.”
Nissan initially said that it would cut a shift at the Smyrna, Tennessee, assembly plant where it makes its popular Rogue SUV once Trump’s tariffs went into effect. But now that the tariffs are here, the company reversed itself, committing to keeping two shifts at the factory.
Nissan is making some other hard decisions, though. The automaker said it would pause orders of the Infiniti QX55, which is built at its COMPAS plant in Aguascalientes, Mexico. Nissan said production is expected to continue for those models sold in other markets.
“We are reviewing our production and supply chain operations to identify optimal solutions for efficiency and sustainability,” spokesperson Lloryn Love-Carter said in a statement. “Our objective is to implement the most effective industrial strategy to offer Nissan and Infiniti customers great product and strong value.”
Porsche has never been the cheapest sports car on the block, but tariffs are likely to put renewed pressure on its prices. Last month, the company’s executives told reporters that it was likely to pass the cost of tariffs along to its customers, according to The Wall Street Journal.
The parent company of Jeep, Dodge, Ram, Maserati, and others has good news and bad news to share in response to the tariffs. The good news is that it’s copying Ford’s idea of employee price discounts to the public. The bad news is that it’s temporarily laying off 900 workers while pausing production at several factories.
Stellantis said it would be pausing production at its Windsor, Ontario, plant for two weeks, from April 7th to April 14th, with operations resuming on April 21st. It’s also pausing production at its Toluca, Mexico, plant for the month of April. The layoffs will affect workers at the Warren Stamping and Sterling Stamping plants in Michigan, as well as the Indiana Transmission Plant and Kokomo Transmission Plant and Kokomo Casting Plant in Indiana.
“We understand that the current environment creates uncertainty,” Antonio Filosa, chief operating officer for the Americas at Stellantis, said in an email to employees. “Be assured that we are very engaged with all of our key stakeholders, including top government leaders, unions, suppliers and dealers in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, as we work to manage and adapt to these changes.”
Stellantis’ employee pricing program will run through April 30th. Discounts vary based on model and location.
Tesla, which is dealing with its own problems, hasn’t immediately responded to the news of the tariffs. That said, CEO Elon Musk has made several comments in response to commentary on X that Tesla is better insulated from the new fees as a result of selling only vehicles made in the US to American customers.
“Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here,” Musk said. “The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant.”
The biggest automaker in the world is keeping its cards close to its vest for now. Toyota has no immediate plans to raise prices as a result of the tariffs, both Japanese media reports and Reuters confirm. Spokesperson Rick Bourgoise declined to comment further.
VW is adding “import fees” to the price of imported cars sold in the US, The New York Times reported. The exact amount will be determined later this month. It was the clearest example yet of Trump’s tariffs leading to higher costs for consumers.
Volvo is thinking about boosting its US-based production, including bringing new models to the factory it operates in Ridgeville, South Carolina, the company’s CEO told Bloomberg. Volvo already builds the EX90 SUV and Polestar 3 at the plant in order to take advantage of the federal EV tax credit.
Volvo spokesperson Sophia Durr declined to comment on any further plans.

4,2025-04-04,"Apple stock dropped 4% in early Friday trading, broadly following yesterday's trend after China announced reciprocal tariffs in response to U.S. President Trump's trade policies. 
The latest decline follows Thursday's dramatic 9% plunge that erased nearly $300 billion from Apple's market value – the company's worst single-day performance in five years – amid growing fears that Trump's trade war will hurt the global economy. Apple's market value was expected to be reduced further today as markets processed China's matching 34% tariff announcement.
China's finance ministry announced it would impose a matching 34% tariff on U.S. imports starting April 10, one day after Trump's new duties take effect. The country also restricted exports of rare earth elements critical for technology manufacturing and added 11 American businesses to its ""Unreliable Entity List.""
Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff plan particularly threatens Apple, which relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing despite years of diversification efforts. The 54% effective rate on Chinese imports combines the new 34% tariff with an existing 20% charge.
Countries where Apple has been expanding its supply chain, including India, Thailand, Malaysia, and Vietnam, were also targeted with tariffs above Trump's global baseline rate of 10%.
Analysts warn Apple faces difficult choices ahead, potentially needing to raise U.S. hardware prices by approximately 30% to offset the tariff impact or accept significant hits to its profit margins.

                Employers speak with attendees during a job fair at the YMCA Gerard Carter Center in Staten Island in New York City on March 27, 2025. Employers continued to add jobs in March, but uncertainty over trade policy and softer spending by consumers could soon be a drag on hiring.

The American labor market just provided a bit of reassuring economic news at the end of a rocky week. 
U.S. employers added 228,000 jobs in March. That's about twice the number added the previous month, when revised figures show employers added 111,000 jobs. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2% from 4.1% in February, as 232,000 people joined or rejoined the workforce.

Jobs were added in health care, hospitality and construction.  Retailers also added jobs — partly as the result of people returning to work after a strike. 
A strong labor market has been a source of stability in recent years, as businesses and consumers battled high inflation. Rising wages have enabled people to keep spending, which has kept the overall economy humming along. Average wages in March were up 3.8% from a year ago. 
Despite the positive labor report on Friday, there are rising concerns about the economy.
The stock market suffered its worst drop in five years on Thursday — and is headed for steep losses on Friday as well — after President Trump ordered steep new tariffs on most of the goods the U.S. imports. 
Spending growth has slowed this spring as cautious shoppers wrestle with uncertainty over the economic outlook. Higher tariffs and a falling stock market could be a further drag in the months to come.

Friday's jobs report also shows some of the effects of the administration's large-scale layoffs.  The federal government cut 4,000 jobs last month, and another 11,000 in February, according to the Labor Department's official tally. That's based on a survey conducted in the middle of the month, but overall job cuts in the federal government are significantly larger. 
Between February and March, the cost-cutting team led by Elon Musk has signaled cuts of more than 280,000 federal workers and contractors in 27 agencies, according to a count kept by the outsourcing firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.
""Job cut announcements were dominated last month by Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) plans to eliminate positions in the federal government,"" said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president at the firm. ""It would have otherwise been a fairly quiet month for layoffs."" 
Surveys of both manufacturing and service sector managers by the Institute for Supply Management this week also point to a shrinking demand for workers.

President Donald Trump delivers remarks on reciprocal tariffs during an event titled ""Make America Wealthy Again"" at the White House in Washington, D.C., on April 2, 2025.
AP
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump offered a rosy assessment after the stock market dropped sharply Thursday over his tariffs, saying, “I think it's going very well.”
“The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom,” he said when asked about the market as he left the White House to fly to one of his Florida golf clubs.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,600 points on Thursday as U.S. stocks led a worldwide selloff after the Republican president's announcement of tariffs against much of the world ignited a shock like none seen since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Trump on Wednesday announced a minimum tariff of 10% on imports, with the tax rate running much higher on products from certain countries like China and those from the European Union.

The announcement jolted markets worldwide, but Trump said that was to be expected. He compared the United States to a sick patient in need of surgery when asked by a reporter for his reaction to the worst stock market drop in years.
“I think it's going very well. We have an operation, like when a patient gets operated on and it's a big thing. I said this would exactly be the way it is,” he said, an apparent reference to the selloff.
He talked about trillions of dollars in investment that is “coming into our country” from companies that want to make their products in the U.S. to avoid tariffs.
“The rest of the world wants to see is there any way they can make a deal,"" he said.

Later, speaking with the reporters on aboard Air Force One, Trump said that he'd be open to using tariffs to negotiate with other countries and that it would depend on whether they had something “phenomenal” to offer in return.
He maintains that other countries have been taking advantage of the U.S. for a long time and he wants it to stop.
“For many years, we’ve been at the wrong side of the ball and I’ll tell you what, I think it’s going to be unbelievable,"" Trump said as he left the White House to attend a Saudi-backed golf tournament at his club in Doral, Florida.

Tariff uncertainty has already lost the tech industry over $1 trillion in market cap.
by  Tina Nguyen and  Kylie Robison
AI companies can’t figure out if the Trump tariffs are about to decimate them – and the fact that no one has a clear answer is sending them, and the tech industry overall, into a confusion spiral. 
The markets are in disarray. Nvidia is down 7.59%, TSMC is down 7.22%. In San Francisco, sources tell us that this isn’t a big deal. But in DC, people are panicking. The core question is whether GPUs – the graphics processing units that are crucial to AI computing and other industries – are exempted from Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs, and the answer is startlingly ambiguous. 
Inside AI labs, researchers expect that their industry will be granted a tariff exemption. “I fully expect this to be a situation where Trump again gives companies he views as important/on his side/whatever a hall pass,” similar to what the President did with Apple during his first term, one source inside a major AI lab told The Verge. 
In Washington, however, nobody seems sure what the current state of play is. The Trump administration spelled out an exception for the semiconductor chips at the heart of a GPU, but for now, complete electronic products that contain chips will apparently be subject to tariffs. And companies that need GPUs for machine learning, deep learning, real-time processing, and much more require not just the chip, but the entire machine built around it. “Most AI GPUs are, I believe, imported not as chips but as servers, largely from Taiwan,” Chris Miller, a professor at Tufts University and the author of Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology, told The Verge in an email. “So these would presumably face the general Taiwan tariff rate” of 32%, currently scheduled to hit on April 9th.
Ordinarily, government agencies might be able to explain what’s happening. But when asked for clarity, a public affairs official at NIST, the agency at the Commerce Department overseeing the CHIPS Act – a $50 billion investment in building chip manufacturing plants on American soil – directed The Verge to the White House. The White House did not immediately return a request for comment. Neither did the U.S. Trade Representative, the agency responsible for creating and executing the President’s tariff strategy. 
While the SF crowd is bullish on getting exemptions, tech lobbyists in Washington are closer to the chaos that is the second Trump administration, and are far too familiar with the president’s mercurial whims and vindictive nature, particularly against the tech industry. The fact that the tariffs are so vague and seem haphazardly thrown together – so haphazard, in fact, that there’s a legitimate argument that they were generated by AI – is only adding to their worries. “Everyone’s asking for clarity” from the administration, one lobbyist at a major tech company told The Verge. “So far, folks are saying that they think we’re okay, but not sure yet.” That’s not exactly a ringing vote of confidence for GPU tariff exemptions. 
The GPU confusion is rippling beyond the AI industry, hitting the Big Tech companies that stock thousands of these devices in datacenters across the country. Amazon, Google, and Microsoft all rely on access to GPUs to prop up their multi-billion dollar cloud architectures. Clearly, the market isn’t confident that their bottom line will weather these tariffs: The so-called “Magnificent Seven”, which includes the three companies above, have lost more than $1 trillion in market capitalization since the tariffs were announced. (Spokespeople for Google and Microsoft declined to comment for this story.) 
The AI industry has reason to think Trump might favor it in particular. Just a few months ago, OpenAI’s Sam Altman and other tech CEOs stood in the White House alongside the president to announce Stargate, a $500 billion datacenter infrastructure project devoted to fulfilling Altman’s demands for “more compute.” The current unclear state of GPUs coupled with the unpredictability of Trump’s tariffs in general, however, could shake their confidence — or at least mean they must renew attempts to curry Trump’s favor.
“If the tariffs are unchanged, we should prepare for a significant increase in the price of electronics.”
GPU juggernaut Nvidia has apparently begun moving manufacturing to the US, which it hopes will help insulate it from the tariffs. Reuters reported last December, for instance, that it was finalizing plans to produce its Blackwell AI GPU chip at TSMC’s Arizona plant, which aims to start fabricating chips this year. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang alluded to this partnership in a recent investor Q&A: “We’re manufacturing in so many different places. We could shift things around. Tariffs will have a little impact for us short term. Long term, we’re going to have manufacturing onshore.” 
The same can’t be said for compute-hungry AI labs, hyperscale cloud providers, or even average PC builders — all of whom might end up paying substantially more for GPUs. “None of this is impossible, but trying to produce every segment of electronics supply chains domestically will produce a staggering increase in cost, especially in the short-term, given that some of the capabilities simply don’t exist domestically,” Miller said. That doesn’t even take into account the tariffs on the raw materials needed to build these machines and plants, or any retaliatory measures: on Friday, for instance, China announced a new set of export restrictions on rare earth minerals, which are crucial for electronics manufacturing. The U.S. currently imports 90 percent of its rare earth minerals from China.
“If the tariffs are unchanged,” Miller added, “we should prepare for a significant increase in the price of electronics.”
But ultimately, fealty to Trump might be more crucial than an appeal to reason. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has pledged allegiance to the new administration, which is important for Anthropic, since it sources some of its compute through Amazon. These deals are fragile, though. A single critical story in Bezos’ paper The Washington Post could lose Amazon (and by association, Anthropic) a tariff exemption, for instance. Anthropic also sources some of its compute through Google; along with Bezos, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai joined the gaggle of tech billionaires behind Trump at his inauguration.
And there are other factors that could indirectly cause problems for these companies, of course — like the US being pushed into a recession that devastates the tech economy. “The second order effects of the tariffs could still be bad,” the AI lab source added.
The market tumbles seemed to have mobilized tech leaders. A group of tech CEOs and finance leaders are on their way to Trump’s private resort, Mar-a-Lago, according to journalist Kara Swisher. The goal seems to be to find some sense in these tariffs — and perhaps some exemptions.

The physical therapy startup Hinge Health is considering delaying its IPO as the public markets plunge in response to President Donald Trump's tariff plans, Business Insider has learned.

        But the startup hopes to forge ahead with its spring initial public offering timeline, as a provider of critical health services.
    

        In March, Hinge Health filed its S-1 form to go public and hoped to start pitching investors toward the end of April, a person familiar with the efforts said.
    

        After Trump announced sweeping retaliatory tariffs on Wednesday— sending the public markets into a frenzy — Hinge Health could be forced to reassess those plans.
    

        Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs are set to range from 10% to 50% on imported goods from about 90 countries, the president said Wednesday. Since that announcement, the S&P 500 has plunged more than 9%.
    

        Hinge Health had hoped to go public sometime in April or May, keeping its plans flexible with the market volatility in mind, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak with the press.
    

        This person said Hinge would still seek to go public unless it couldn't draw investors' attention away from the volatility in their portfolios. The startup has plenty of cash on its balance sheet and doesn't need the IPO proceeds to finance the business, they said.
    

        A representative for Hinge Health declined to comment.
    

        It appears Hinge isn't the only startup considering delaying its IPO plans. The payments platform Klarna and the online ticket marketplace StubHub both put their plans on ice following the tariffs announcement, The Wall Street Journal said. The outlet added that Klarna and StubHub planned to pitch public investors on their respective IPOs next week but decided to postpone their road shows after the past two days of market volatility.
    

        Klarna and StubHub both declined to comment to BI.
    

        Hinge Health would be the first healthcare delivery startup to go public in nearly three years. The IPO market has been decidedly closed for digital health startups since 2021, and the healthcare companies from that year's IPOs haven't performed well on the public markets.
    

        The San Francisco company launched in 2014 to provide virtual care for joint and muscle pain. It's raised more than $1 billion from venture capitalists, including Tiger Global, Coatue, Insight Partners, and Atomico, including a $400 million Series E in October 2021 at a $6.2 billion valuation.
    

        The company's public S-1 filing in March showed a strong financial profile for a healthcare startup. It reported $390 million in revenue in 2024, up 33% from the previous year's revenue, and a 77% gross margin. It's not profitable but getting close, recording $45 million of free cash flow in 2024 but a net loss of $11.9 million for the full year.
    

        The person familiar with Hinge Health's IPO plans said the startup's business is somewhat recession-proof as a healthcare benefits provider that can help drive cost savings for employers. Hinge Health also doesn't charge copays for its services, which the person said makes its platform more compelling when the cost of living surges.
    

        Hinge Health isn't the only healthcare startup hoping for a public market debut. Omada Health confidentially filed its S-1 this past summer, BI reported in October. Hinge Health's rival Sword Health has also expressed interest in going public when the IPO window reopens for healthcare companies.

10,2025-04-04,"President Donald Trump announced Friday that he will sign another executive order to allow TikTok to continue to operate in the U.S. for 75 days while a deal to sell the social media platform is negotiated. Trump made the announcement on Truth Social, the platform he continues to own in defiance of the U.S. Constitution’s emoluments clause, which prohibits the president from profiting through his position as the most powerful person in the country.
“My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress,” Trump wrote Friday. “The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days.”
Trump, who shared a video on Truth Social Friday that said he was “purposely” crashing the stock market, wrote that he’s trying to work with officials in China, where TikTok’s parent company Bytedance is based.
“We hope to continue working in Good Faith with China, who I understand are not very happy about our Reciprocal Tariffs (Necessary for Fair and Balanced Trade between China and the U.S.A.!). This proves that Tariffs are the most powerful Economic tool, and very important to our National Security!” Trump continued.
Trump’s announcement on Wednesday of shockingly broad tariffs imposed on virtually every country around the world has roiled markets, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down over 1,600 points Friday at the time of this writing. Every country was hit with at least 10% tariffs, but China received an even higher tariff of 34%, on top of the 20% Trump had already imposed. China announced it was retaliating on Friday with its own 24% tariff on U.S. goods, according to the New York Times.
Congress passed a law in 2024, signed by President Joe Biden, that was supposed to force Bytedance to sell TikTok to American interests or it would be banned from operating in the U.S. The platform briefly went dark in the U.S. for a couple of days when the deadline of Jan. 19 passed without a sale, but Trump revived the company’s operations by simply declaring he was giving TikTok an extension. That extension was due to expire on April 5, but Trump’s new 75-day extension appears to give the company until June 19 to be sold or face a ban.
“We do not want TikTok to ‘go dark.’ We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Trump wrote on Truth Social in his characteristically weird manner.
Several potential buyers have reportedly put in bids for the company, including Amazon, Oracle, CNBC personality Kevin O’Leary, and online media brand Mr. Beast, among others. But Bytedance has reportedly said it’s not interested in selling. The main sticking point appears to be TikTok’s algorithm, which the Chinese government considers proprietary technology that can’t be exported to foreign adversaries like the U.S. Hypothetically, a U.S. entity could buy the TikTok brand without the algorithm, but it’s not clear whether there’s any interest in that. The algorithm is really the whole reason people use TikTok.

12,2025-04-04,"The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq are sliding as the stock market reels from a massive selloff following President Donald Trump's shock tariffs announcement."
13,2025-04-04,"Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, is ostensibly a tech company that operates a middling social media platform. In practice, it’s something closer to a way for opportunistic investors to suck up to the President. But it appears Trump may be ready to cash out.Â According to the Financial Times, a recentÂ filingÂ by the company to the Securities and Exchange Commission indicates that the trust Trump stashed his shares in is now permitted to sell his stake. According to the filing, the mix of shares will be sold offÂ âfrom time to time in one or more offerings.â
Trump holds nearly 115 million shares of TMTG, which accounts for about 53% of the total shares in the company. With the stock hovering between $18 and $19 a shareâfrankly, an absurd share price for a company that basically just runs a social media platform designed to receive posts from Trumpâthe President’s stake is worth more than $2 billion. Following the 2024 election, TrumpÂ shifted those sharesÂ into the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, theoretically taking control out of his hands… except the trust is controlled by Donald Trump Jr., who is not exactly an independent operator.
The President has also insisted on multiple occasions that heÂ won’t sell his sharesÂ in the company, which he’s technically beenÂ allowed to doÂ since September of last year. Fears that he’ll sell have historically sent the stock into a tailspin because the real value of the company seems to be the ability to cozy up to Trump.Â Experts have warnedÂ that the publicly traded company offers easy avenues for special interests and foreign investors to do some unofficial favor trading. There is really no rational reason to invest in TMTG other than being a Trump bud or fanatic. TheÂ tech sucks and it reported a loss of more than $400 million last year.
Whether any outside sources have tried to use the stock to manipulate anyone or not, it has certainly been a place where Trump loyalists have come to profit. Attorney General Pam BondiÂ ownsÂ about $2 million worth of shares in TMTG. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon serves as director of TMTG and wasÂ giftedÂ $826,000 worth of shares in January 2025. FBI Director Kash Patel got his own âgiftâ of $826,000 worth of shares at the start of the year, tooâafter he filed his financial disclosures to the government. Intelligence Board nominee Devin Nunes is currently the CEO of TMTG and is sitting on more than $20 million worth of stock holdingsâplus, heÂ gets a salary and bonus from the company, which netted him $1.6 million last year.
TMTGÂ arguedÂ that its recent filing, which also shows that Bondi and Nunes are looking to sell some of their stake in the company, was just a routine filing and that “Legacy media outlets are spreading a fake story suggesting that a TMTG filing today is paving the way for the Trump trust to sell its shares in TMTGâ¦In fact, there currently is no open window for any affiliate to sell shares.”Â  But odds are some of these folks are going to want to turn their theoretical cash into the real stuff at some point.

14,2025-04-04,"The major selloff extended losses touched off by Trump's sweeping new tariffs.
U.S. stocks closed down significantly on Friday after a continued selloff amid fallout from President Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 2,230 points, or 5.5%, while the S&P 500 plunged 6%.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 5.8%. The decline put the Nasdaq into bear market territory, meaning the index has fallen more than 20% from its recent peak.
The trading session on Friday marked the worst day for U.S. stocks since 2020. The second-worst day for U.S. stocks since that year happened on Thursday, a day earlier. Over the past two days, the S&P 500 dropped more than 10%.
Corporate giants that rely on supply chains abroad were among the firms that continued to see shares fall. Apple fell 7% and e-commerce firm Amazon slid 4%.
Shares fell for each of the so-called ""Magnificent Seven,"" a group of large tech firms that helped drive stock market gains in recent years.
Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, dropped 5%. Chipmaker Nvidia slid 7%.
Tesla, the electric carmaker led by Trump-advisor Elon Musk, declined more than 10%.
On Friday, China said it will impose 34% tariffs on U.S. goods in response to the levies issued by Trump earlier this week.
In a social media post hours later, Trump signaled a commitment to the tariff policy.
""TO THE MANY INVESTORS COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES AND INVESTING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY, MY POLICIES WILL NEVER CHANGE,"" Trump said on Truth Social.
Trump later criticized China in a different social media post, saying, ""CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED - THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!""
Trump's Wednesday announcement of tariffs on nearly all American trade partners sent U.S. and foreign markets alike into a tailspin.
All three major American stock markets closed down on Thursday, marking their worst day since June 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The NASDAQ fell 6%, the S&P 500 4.8% and the Dow Jones nearly 4%
Global markets gave early signals of the difficulty to come on Friday. Japan's Nikkei index lost 3.5% on Friday, while the broader Japanese Topix index fell 4.45%.
In South Korea, the KOSPI index was down 1.7%, with the country grappling with both Trump's tariffs and the news that South Korea's Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol.
Indian investors joined the sell-off on Friday, with the Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex indexes both falling more than 1%. India's stock markets had previously performed better than others thanks to lower tariffs than competitors like China, Indonesia and Vietnam.
Australia's S&P/ASX, meanwhile, continued its slide into Friday with another 2% drop taking the index to an 8-month low.
In Europe, too, stock markets fell upon opening. Britain's FTSE 100 index dropped more than 1%, Germany's DAX fell 0.75%, France's CAC lost 0.9% and Spain's IBEX slipped 1.4%.

Bad news, gamers — you're going to have to wait a bit longer to preorder the Nintendo Switch 2.

        Nintendo has blamed Trump's tariffs for a delay in when Americans can preorder its highly anticipated Switch 2 game console.
    

        The company is pushing back preorders from April and will announce the new preorder date ""at a later date,"" per a company statement shared with Business Insider.
    

        ""Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,"" the statement read. ""Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.""
    

        Previously, Nintendo said that North American customers would be able to preorder from ""participating retailers"" on April 9. The company also had plans to allow preorders directly from its website starting May 8, but the statement didn't say whether this date was also subject to change.
    

        Nintendo said it still plans to launch the Switch 2 on June 5, with a price of $449.99.
    

        The company previously moved some production of its original Switch from China to Vietnam due to economic tensions between China and the US.
    

        This week, Vietnam was hit with a 46% reciprocal tariff, while China saw a 34% reciprocal tariff.

Nintendo is pushing back preorders for the Switch 2 due to concerns about Donald Trump’s newly announced tariffs. According to a statement sent to The Verge by Eddie Garcia on behalf of Nintendo, it says preorders will no longer begin on April 9th:
Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.There’s still no word on when preorders will begin, as Nintendo says it will “update timing at a later date.” Nintendo still plans to launch the Switch 2 on June 5th.
It was going to send out invitations letting customers who met certain requirements preorder the Switch 2 directly from its website starting May 8th, but now it’s unclear when they will happen.
The Switch 2 costs $449.99 and comes with several upgrades, including a larger 7.9-inch 1080p display, 256GB of storage, and a C-button for in-game chats. We don’t know yet whether the Switch 2 or its accessories will go up in price in response to the tariffs. The Switch 2 is already significantly more expensive than its $299 predecessor, while its games have a steeper $69.99 to $79.99 price.
Nintendo revealed the Switch 2 on Wednesday — the same day President Donald Trump announced far-reaching tariffs affecting a number of US trade partners. We’re already starting to see the impact of this latest round of tariffs, with board game maker Steve Jackson Games saying it will be a “seismic shift” for the industry, predictions that it will be a “debacle of epic proportions for the auto industry,” and the card grading service PSA pausing submissions from outside the US.

The tariff mayhem is throwing Amazon into uncertain territory.

        Forecasting, for example, has become nearly impossible for some teams. One of Amazon's largest supply chain units recently warned about the challenges of making its second-quarter projections due to tariffs, according to an internal email obtained by Business Insider.
    

        The ""volatility and uncertainty"" from the new round of tariffs were simply too high to derive any meaningful numbers, the email said.
    

        Amazon employees, alongside suppliers and sellers, are scrambling for answers as President Donald Trump's whipsaw trade policy roils the country's largest e-commerce retailer. On Thursday, Amazon was among the hardest-hit stocks when roughly $2.5 trillion was wiped out of the S&P500 Index over Trump's aggressive tariff plan.
    

        Amazon has given little guidance or financial flexibility so far, according to multiple employees, suppliers, and sellers, who mostly spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press. Tension is intensifying as concerns of a prolonged trade war and potential recession loom.
    

        Amazon's spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment.
    

        The same email from Amazon's supply chain team said that the near-term impact of tariffs will ultimately be captured and reflected in a later forecast. But the exposure to tariffs and a global trade war is ""a large risk"" that can set back Amazon's retail business going forward, it added.
    

        Some Amazon employees have been in direct contact with its suppliers, commonly known as first-party vendors. These companies sell their products wholesale to Amazon, which then resells them to shoppers.
    

        These vendors said Amazon isn't willing to pay more for their products, even if the tariffs would increase the suppliers' costs. According to a March email seen by BI, an Amazon employee encourages vendors to seek further cost savings from their own manufacturers or through government subsidies.
    

        ""We understand the challenges posed by the current economic and trade environment,"" the email said. ""However, we believe there are alternatives to direct cost increases that haven't been fully explored.""
    

        Some vendors told BI that Amazon also seeks ""margin agreements"" that guarantee the same margin after a vendor increases its prices. That way, Amazon would maintain its profit margins from its suppliers, even if it buys the products at a higher price.
    

        In some cases, Amazon is pausing shipment orders from vendors to monitor the market. One shipping company recently told a vendor that ""as per Amazon's request,"" it was holding the pick-up schedule of inventory to ""mitigate the impact"" of tariffs, according to an email seen by BI.
    

        Alan Adams, president of Navazon, a vendor software company, told BI that tariff discussions with Amazon employees have been ongoing for months. He said both Amazon and the suppliers are pursuing ways to adapt to the new market conditions, but the constant policy changes make finding a long-term solution difficult.
    

        ""We are all in a wait-and-see mode with a tremendous amount of uncertainty across different categories,"" Adams said.
    

        Trump imposed sweeping tariff increases on most countries this week. The changes are expected to increase prices across a variety of goods.
    

        Truist Securities' Youssef Squali said the tariffs will likely have an adverse effect on e-commerce companies, including Amazon. Import costs will likely eat into their margins, though it will still take time to fully measure their impact on each individual company, he wrote in a note Friday. Amazon's stock is down roughly 10% from Wednesday.
    

        Third-party merchants who sell on Amazon told BI they will likely have to raise their prices due to the tariffs.
    

        Charles Chakkalo, founder of JoeyzShopping, who sells home and kitchen items, said he anticipates over 50% tariffs on his products. To counter, he will have to raise prices, while leveraging his unit volume to lower manufacturing costs.
    

        Oscar Babarin, managing director of marketing agency Hawke Media, said a number of his clients are feeling the impact deeply. Some of them are scaling back their business, while others are more aggressively pursuing market share, he said.
    

        However, some sellers, are excited about the elimination of the de minimis exemption that allowed tax-free shipments of Chinese imports valued at less than $800, according to Oliver Scutt, board member of Merchant AI. Those sellers expect less competition from Temu and Shein following the change, he said.
    

        Still, most sellers and vendors said they feel helpless against the complexity of trade policies. On Thursday, as the market plunged, one supplier emailed an Amazon manager to ask for additional guidance, only to receive very little support.
    

        ""Rest assured, we are looking into it,"" the Amazon manager said.

19,2025-04-04,"If you have an older Apple device that you've been considering upgrading, you're probably wondering how the newly announced tariffs might impact prices going forward, and whether it's worth buying now before there's a price hike.
Given analyst and economist responses to the tariffs, market panic, and Trump's stance on the current financial chaos, the answer is that making a purchase immediately might save you some cash if things don't change.

Trump announced a 34 percent tariff on China, which combines with the previous 20 percent tariff for a total of a 54 percent tax on imports from China. China is still one of Apple's major suppliers, and industry analysts consulted by Reuters suggest that iPhone prices could increase by up to 43 percent.
Right now, the most affordable current-generation ‌iPhone‌, the iPhone 16e, is priced starting at $599. If Apple doesn't receive some kind of exemption or if tariffs don't change, the ‌iPhone 16e‌ could be priced starting at $856. The $799 iPhone 16 could cost $1,142, close to the starting price of the iPhone 16 Pro Max.
Equity research company Rosenblatt Securities believes Apple will need to raise ‌iPhone‌ and Apple Watch prices 43 percent to cover tariffs, iPad prices 42 percent, and Mac and AirPod prices 39 percent. Counterpoint Research co-founder Neil Shah believes Apple would need to raise prices by at least 30 percent on average to offset the tariffs.
Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring told CNBC that Apple would likely need to raise prices by 17 to 18 percent.
Apple has moved some of its production to other countries like Vietnam, India, Thailand, and Malaysia, but all of those locations are subject to tariffs as well. A 40 percent+ price increase is a worst case scenario, and there are a lot of variables at play and factors that could shift in the near future, but it doesn't look like prices are going to remain static.

Trump said that he would implement tariffs, and tech companies like Apple knew that this was coming. It's likely that Apple has been ramping up U.S. supply of current devices so that it can temporarily avoid raising prices. Under the terms of the tariff executive order, Apple won't have to pay tariffs for goods that are on a vessel and in transit to their destination before 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on April 9, so the company has a few more days to stock up as much as possible.
When available stock in the United States starts dwindling, Apple will have hard decisions to make. Raising prices significantly will impact demand for the ‌iPhone‌ in a market where people are already wary of spending because of economic uncertainty, but such high tariffs would significantly eat into Apple's profit margin and further tank its stock.
Apple could have enough ‌iPhone 16‌ models in the U.S. already to avoid price increases until the iPhone 17 models launch, but it is hard to imagine a scenario where ‌iPhone 17‌ prices don't go up at least somewhat.
CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said Apple could struggle to increase consumer costs more than 5 to 10 percent. ""We expect Apple to hold off on any major increases on phones until this fall when its ‌iPhone 17‌ is set to launch, as it is typically how it handles planned price hikes,"" he said.
Bank of America securities analyst Wamsi Mohan said that if Apple were to absorb the entire impact, there could be a $1.24 reduction to earnings per share in 2026. Apple could adjust prices, optimize supply chains, and seek exemptions to deal with the tariffs, according to Mohan, so it's possible Apple will have a multi-prong strategy.
Yale Budget Lab executive director Martha Gimbel told The New York Times that companies are going to have to increase costs. ""These are really big tariffs,"" she said. ""These are not things we can expect companies to just absorb.""

On his Truth Social site, Trump said today that he does not plan to change his policies. Yesterday, he said ""I think it's going very well - The MARKETS are going to BOOM...""
He also said, however, that he had a ""productive call"" with Vietnam about lowering tariffs, and that he is looking forward to a meeting ""in the near future.""
Trump has gone back and forth on tariffs levied against Canada and Mexico, so it is hard to say what he'll do next. The executive order states that he can increase or expand tariffs based on retaliation, or decrease or limit in scope the tariffs should countries ""take significant steps to remedy non-reciprocal trade arrangements and align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national security matters.""

Congress could act, but with a Republican majority, there are barriers. The Senate passed a resolution that would block tariffs on Canadian products, but it will fizzle out in the House. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley proposed a bipartisan bill that would require Trump to notify Congress about new tariffs with Congress given a 60-day period to approve them, but it doesn't have enough Republican support. It's not clear if it will make progress, and it would need to overcome a presidential veto if it did.

The last time Trump was in office, he levied tariffs that did not apply to the ‌iPhone‌, and he gave Apple an exemption for products like the Apple Watch.
This time, Trump has given no exemptions, and it's not clear if he will. Cook met with Trump in February, and even donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration. Cook has no doubt been wooing Trump for an exemption from Apple, but it hasn't worked so far.
Trump used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to implement tariffs, so any exemption would need to come directly from Trump. There is no mechanism for individual product exemptions, so Apple doesn't even have a way to petition for an exception.

If Apple needs to increase prices, it would make the most sense for the company to introduce ‌iPhone‌ price hikes with the ‌iPhone 17‌, but it's not clear if it will be able to hold off that long, nor when prices on other devices could increase.

This morning, Nintendo canceled U.S. pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2. Pre-orders were set to start on April 9, but Nintendo says that it will now ""assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions"" before providing updated timing at a later date.
Apple has not yet made any comment on the tariffs or its plans going forward, but the company is likely working behind the scenes to calculate the impact.

With all of the uncertainty, if you're in need of a new Apple device and have the funds available, it's probably best to buy very soon. That may mean opting to upgrade an older ‌iPhone‌ to an ‌iPhone 16‌ model instead of an ‌iPhone 17‌, or choosing to get a Mac now rather than holding out for a sale.
Trump could fold, other countries could negotiate lower tariffs, or Apple could get an exemption, but there is no clear picture of what's going to happen.

The tariffs that Trump announced on Wednesday will go into effect on Wednesday, April 9.

20,2025-04-04,"This week, Trump announced his plans to implement wide-ranging tariffs on all imports into the United States. The move sent the stock market into a free fall, with Apple among many companies down over 10% for the week.



While the world prepares for the full…"
21,2025-04-04,"President Trump’s sweeping global tariffs have rocked the stock market since being announced on Tuesday, with just about every major tech company down double-digits. Semiconductors were largely spared from an immediate impact, however, as chips from Taiwan and other nations were exempted. Most electronics sold in the United States are powered by chips made in Asia, meaning tariffs would have a significant impact on prices. But Trump told a White House press pool on Thursday that tariffs on semiconductors will be imposed “very soon.”
Already, tariffs on foreign-made goods have led Nintendo to announce a delay in U.S. pre-orders for the Switch 2 while it assesses the potential impact of tariffs. And Klarna, the buy-now-pay-later startup made a meme for letting customers pay for food deliveries in installments, delayed its planned IPO on Friday. Global economic uncertainty probably hurts the business case for financing Chipotle burritos through zero-interest, unsecured loans.
President Trump had already threatened to impose large tariffs on semiconductors made abroad as the United States aims to build more crucial technology domestically. China’s closure of Shanghai in 2022 over a COVID-19 outbreak highlighted the risk of relying on long, international supply chains for essential manufacturing. TSMC, one of the major chipmakers that makes products for the likes of Nvidia and Apple, has committed more than $100 billion to open production and R&D facilities in the United States, but scaling takes a long time. Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, estimated it would take Apple three years and $20 billion to move ten percent of manufacturing to the U.S.
If President Trump is trying to make the United States more competitive in manufacturing, it makes some sense to include chips in tariffs. Domestic manufacturers like Intel rely on foreign-made hardware to build their chips locally, and with tariffs in place, that hardware will cost more, subsequently meaning the chips themselves will not be competitive to those built abroad.
Tom’s Hardware detailed how prices of chips could increase under new tariffs:
For example, if there is a 25% tariff on an Nvidia AI GPU that the company sells for $50,000 with a 75% gross margin, then Nvidia will have to declare a value of $12,500 and pay an import duty of $3,125. Such a tariff will either hurt Nvidia’s margins or make its GPUs more expensive for buyers in America. For Elon Musk’s next-generation data centers, which are set to contain a million GPUs, this means $3.125 billion of additional costs.
President Trump has said that the tariffs imposed on Wednesday are meant to create a level playing field for manufacturing. And while it makes sense to move some manufacturing back to the United States, doing so takes many years. Products made domestically will still surely be more expensive than alternatives made abroad. Labor in the United States is expensive, and worker protections and regulations add to that burden. America has long been a service economy; people in the U.S. do not want to do hard labor.
Certain sectors like chipmaking may be viable to reshore to the United States as they are higher margin businesses than commodity goods like toasters or shoes. But it is unclear whether physical products made in the United States would ever be competitive globally, and manufacturers would still need to import rare earth metals that are not found in U.S. soil. The largest economy in the world is adept at servicesâdesigning products, writing codeâand leaving the elbow work to other countries. Even if manufacturing of durable goods does come back to America, there is a widespread belief that much of it will be automated, such as with Tesla’s Optimus robot. Amazon has continued to invest heavily in automating its factories.
Under tariffs one could envision Americans paying more for lower-quality goods, especially making the new tax regressive to low-income Americans. And for businesses, they could make U.S. companies less competitive because their costs of doing business will be higher. And this is at a time when China is racing ahead in fields like AI and automotive.
Many economists believe that a budget deficit, which the U.S. currently faces, means the country spends more importing goods than it does exporting. But there are other ways to balance the books that would not harm Americans in the process, like negotiating down drug prices. Tariff differences similarly could be ameliorated without creating enemies. All countries support their domestic industries to some extent, such as by subsidizing agriculture. Some middle ground could theoretically be achieved.
Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell said on Friday that Trump’s tariffs will likely stoke âhigher inflation and slower growth,” and warned that unemployment could rise after several months of strength. But he added that the Federal Reserve is not going to immediately lower interest rates, which could dampen the impact. Which is to say, Powell does not plan on bailing out Trump despite widespread criticism of the tariffs amongst the business community.

Protein powder is my secret ingredient. It's a versatile spice, ready to boost any of my go-to recipes from smoothies to muffins to morning waffles. I rely on it to fill in the nutritional gaps when my meals aren’t winning any wellness awards. While the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for protein is just 0.36 grams per pound of body weight, that’s the minimum to avoid deficiency, not the sweet spot for optimal health. Depending on how active you are or your dietary needs, your daily protein recommendation may need more.
What was once the territory of gym bros trying to bulk up has exploded into the mainstream. Protein powders are on every shelf, in every form and flavor, and for every dietary preference. Whether you’re plant-based, a picky eater, or need a quick nutrient boost, protein powder is your fast pass. But with so many options, fads, and a never-ending list of additives, it’s easy to grab the wrong one. I’ve sifted through the market to find the best of the best protein powders.

Are Protein Shakes Good For You?
It depends. If you’re eating a balanced diet, you’re likely getting all the protein your body needs. Whole foods—nuts, seeds, eggs, low-fat dairy, legumes, and lean meats—offer protein along with fiber, vitamins, and other nutrients that a scoop of powder simply can’t match.
That said, high-quality protein powder may be beneficial under medical supervision if you are recovering from surgery or an injury, have difficulty eating due to illness or aging, or need extra protein for wound healing. It’s also useful if you’re following a strict diet (like veganism) and aren’t getting enough protein through food alone. For athletes, protein powder can be a convenient way to refuel post-workout because the body absorbs liquid protein quickly. Unless you fall into one of these categories, you don’t need a protein powder.
What Are the Potential Harms of Protein Powder?
While high-protein diets have been studied extensively, the long-term effects of regularly consuming protein in powdered form remain unclear.
Not all protein powders are contaminated, but it’s worth checking third-party testing results (like those published by Clean Label Project) before incorporating one into your diet.
Types of Protein Powder
When you're looking at different protein sources, also keep in mind whether you're getting a complete or incomplete protein. All of our picks are complete proteins, meaning that they provide all nine essential amino acids that the body doesn't product itself.
Whey protein: Whey protein comes from milk during the cheese-making process, and it’s one of the most efficient ways to get protein into your system. It’s packed with essential amino acids, meaning your body can absorb and use it quickly—great for muscle recovery and growth. There are three whey subtypes, each with its own pros and cons.
Casein protein: Casein is the other major protein in milk. When consumed, it forms a gel in your stomach, meaning your body gets a slow, steady release of amino acids. This makes a great option for pre-bedtime protein or keeping hunger at bay between meals. There are two main subtypes:
Pea protein: This plant-based protein is made from ground yellow split peas and high in essential amino acids, including BCAAs. It’s dairy-, gluten-, and soy-free, making it great for people with allergies. Technically, it’s a complete protein, but it’s lower in methionine, so some experts would argue it’s not as complete as whey.
Brown rice protein: Brown rice protein is high in fiber, easy to digest, and hypoallergenic, but it lacks some essential amino acids (specifically lysine), making it an incomplete protein. That’s why it’s often blended with pea protein for a more balanced amino acid profile. It’s gentle on the stomach and good for people with multiple food sensitivities.
What to Consider
Protein source: Whey, casein, soy, pea, brown rice, egg white—protein powder comes in many forms and cater to different needs (muscle growth, weight loss, weight gain, post-workout recovery, etc.). Your choice depends on dietary preferences and your personal goals.
Protein content: If your goal is muscle growth, aim for 20 to 30 grams per scoop. Otherwise, match the amount of protein to your dietary or fitness needs.
Processing method: Concentrates are the least processed and have more nutrients. Isolates tend to have higher protein content and fewer carbs and fats, while hydrolysates digest the fastest.
Allergens and dietary preferences: Make sure your protein powder aligns with your diet. If you're allergic to dairy, soy, gluten, or nuts, double-check labels as many powders sneak in allergens. If you've had digestive issues before, start with a small quantity to test your tolerance before going all in.
Additives and fillers: Watch for artificial sweeteners, gums, and thickening agents that can cause bloating and other gastrointestinal issues.
Flavors: Powders now come in every flavor from matcha to fruity cereal milk. Choose a flavor you'll actually drink.
Brand reputation and certifications: Some brands are rigorous about quality control, third-party testing, and ingredient sourcing, and others aren't. If you want peace of mind, look for certifications like Informed Sport and NSF Certified for Sport, which verifies that the product contains what it advertises and is free of banned substances.
Cost: Compare cost per serving instead of just the upfront price.
How We Tested and Picked
I've been downing protein powders for years, but for this guide, I put each one through a fresh round of testing. Each powder was sampled at least three times to assess taste, texture, and mixability. I mixed them with water, milk, and non-dairy alternatives. I also baked them into muffins and blended into the occasional smoothie because not all of us like our protein straight.
I prioritized powders with minimal to no additives and full transparency in sourcing—no unnecessary fillers, gums, or questionable sweeteners. Solubility was a major consideration, too. I also scrutinized manufacturing practices and third-party testing. Certifications (like NSF Certified for Sport or Informed Choice) mattered. Every pick is also a complete protein, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids.
Optimum Nutrition’s Gold Standard Whey has been a longtime favorite among gym rats. It’s affordable, widely available, and tastes good. It delivers 24 grams of protein per serving, sourced from a blend of whey isolate, concentrate, and peptides. The vanilla ice cream flavor has been my go-to for three years. I use it in smoothies, but I love it even more for baking—I like to swap a couple of scoops for some of the flour in banana bread to give it a protein boost without tasting chalky. Reviewer Louryn Strampe loves the banana cream, which she swears tastes like a yellow Laffy Taffy.
While it’s not the “cleanest” protein powder on the market—there are options with fewer additives—it’s reassuring to know the Clean Label Project gave the vanilla ice cream flavor its stamp of approval earlier this year, confirming it tested free of arsenic, lead, cadmium, and mercury.
Orgain’s Organic Protein Powder blends pea, brown rice, chia, and mung bean proteins to hit all nine essential amino acids. It’s USDA-certified organic, kosher, and delivers 21 grams of protein, plus 4 grams of fiber and prebiotics for a little digestive support. With about 15 grams of carbs per serving, it leans higher-carb than some plant-based competitors, but that also makes it more filling—ideal if you need something to hold you over between meals.
I’ve tested my fair share of vanilla proteins, and Orgain’s vanilla bean flavor is one of the better ones. It’s smooth, not overly sweet, and blends up surprisingly creamy despite being dairy-free. While the formula is free from artificial sweeteners, most flavors include erythritol and gums, which can cause digestive issues for some. Some flavors, like birthday cake, sneak up to 450 milligrams of sodium per serving, which is 20 percent of your daily limit. The iced coffee flavor comes with 60 milligrams of caffeine.
Collagen-based powders aren’t the best for muscle growth, but they’ve gained a loyal following for their supposed benefits for hair, skin, and joint health. Vital Proteins’ Vital Performance Protein Powder sets itself apart with an NSF Certified for Sport credential, meaning it’s been third-party tested for safety and label accuracy.
This formula combines milk protein isolate with bovine-sourced collagen peptides, making it a gentler option for those with lactose intolerance since it contains minimal to no milk sugar. (It’s still a milk byproduct, so steer clear if you have a dairy allergy.) The powder dissolves well in water or milk alike without clumps. It works well in smoothies and even holds up in baking if you want to sneak some protein into your pancakes.
Ritual prides itself on transparency, offering a traceable supply chain, so you know exactly what’s going into your protein shake. The Protein Daily Shake 18+ is crafted from organic yellow field peas, grown and harvested exclusively in North America. By sourcing from regenerative farms, Ritual minimizes heavy metal contamination risks and reduces its carbon footprint. The vanilla flavor is handcrafted using vanilla extract sourced from Madagascar. No surprise that it’s certified by the Clean Label Project and won the organization's Purity Award.
Ritual’s pea protein is enhanced with L-methionine, rounding out the amino acid profile, with eight grams of essential amino acids and four grams of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) per serving. It’s a clean option: soy-free, gluten-free, vegan, and free from GMOs, stevia, sugar alcohols, and artificial flavors or colors. While I haven’t tested Ritual’s Pregnancy & Postpartum Daily Shake, it’s worth noting it delivers 250 milligrams of choline per serving to support increased dietary needs during pregnancy and lactation.
The beauty of Naked is in its minimalist approach. With only one ingredient—micellar casein sourced from hormone-free skim milk—it’s about as clean as it gets. No added sugar, no artificial sweeteners, and no unnecessary additives. This cold-processed protein is designed to avoid any nastiness from chemicals or synthetic fillers, and it’s independently tested for both heavy metals and gluten. Each serving packs 26 grams of protein and 618 milligrams of calcium (about 48 percent of your daily value). I like to blend it up with unsweetened almond milk, frozen raspberries and mango, chia seeds, and a drizzle of lemon-infused honey for a silky smoothie. Just note that Naked Casein doesn’t contain lecithin, so it won’t dissolve as smoothly as other powders; the best way to mix is with a blender.
If you're picky about what goes into your protein powder, Momentous checks a lot of boxes. The company sources its whey from European dairy farms, where regulations ensure the cows are grass-fed and free from hormones, steroids, and rBST. The whey is processed using cold microfiltration to preserve its amino acid profile, and it includes ProHydrolase, an enzyme blend meant to boost digestion and absorption. Momentous is NSF Certified for Sport and Informed Sport, making it a top pick for athletes. It's free from fillers, gums, and refined sugar, though it does use natural flavors.
With 20 grams of protein per serving, it's great for most people, but bodybuilders and lifters may prefer a powder with a higher protein content. The macros are lean—just three grams of carbs (two from fiber, which helps with satiety) and 1.5 grams of fat, likely from the sunflower lecithin that improves mixability. Taste-wise, it's not the most pleasant on its own. If you like to drink protein straight with water, you might find this one a little rough. I prefer to blend it into a fruit smoothie.
When it comes to easy-to-digest protein, Promix Grass-Fed Whey Isolate stands out. Micro-filtered to contain less than 1 gram of lactose, it's designed for sensitive stomachs. Each serving delivers 30 grams of protein, 6.6 grams of BCAAs, and 14.2 grams of essential amino acids. Promix also nails texture; with less than one percent non-GMO sunflower lecithin, this natural emulsifier helps dissolve the powder in water and milk without any grittiness. I've tossed it into shakes and muffins—the protein shakes weren't my favorite, but the baked goods turned out delicious.
The brand also sells protein puff bars (15 grams of protein) in flavors like blueberries & cream, snickerdoodle, and mint chocolate. While I found them too chalky, my partner loved them, so they might be worth trying if you're looking for snackable protein.
This powder is unusual in that it's not whey-, soy-, or pea-based, but consists entirely of powdered Peruvian lupin bean. A boon for those looking for a clean, single-source source of protein, Mikuna is vegan, paleo, keto, and gluten-free, and even the non-plain flavors (vanilla, cacao) only have five ingredients—along with calcium, fiber, iron, and all nine amino acids.
The flavored versions are actually quite tasty, sweetened with cacao powder or vanilla extract, coconut blossom nectar, and monkfruit. Be forewarned, though, that the powder alone can be texturally challenging—online reviews describe it as gritty and chalky, and after drinking it regularly for a few months, I think that’s being generous. (It will keep its suspension longer if mixed with a handheld electric whisk.) Mikuna is, however, an excellent way to bulk up a smoothie, and a potential game changer for those with digestive problems aggravated by dairy, soy, or peas. —Kat Merck
This vanilla protein powder is the secret behind my favorite post-workout snack that masquerades as dessert. I mix it with Greek yogurt, whipped cream cheese (not regular!), and some crumbled graham crackers to make a little protein cheesecake dessert. I usually do about half a cup of the yogurt and cheese to anywhere between half a scoop to a full scoop of powder; you should taste-test it yourself to find your perfect ratio. It’s a great go-to after an evening workout, or in my case, a late aerial dance class that leaves my shoulder muscles screaming.
The Isopure’s vanilla flavor is impressively strong. It can taste a little too strong without enough ingredients to balance it out. It would make for a fun addition to a smoothie or other mock desserts, like some frozen banana ice cream. It has a really nice vanilla scent to it, too. —Nena Farrell
Sakara Protein + Greens Super Powder for $90: With 17 grams of plant-based protein per serving, Sakara's Protein + Greens is just thr3e shy of the 20-gram benchmark we aim for. The blend of pea, hemp, and pumpkin proteins is bolstered by a “super greens” mix of spirulina, wheatgrass, barley grass, and chlorella. Is it dramatically transforming my gut health? Probably not. But on days when my vegetable and protein intake is low, a scoop of this in my smoothie (plus some Greek yogurt for an extra 18 grams of protein) makes me feel a little less like a goblin surviving on iced coffee and string cheese.
Ghost Whey Protein Powder for $50 (2.2 pounds): Ghost is the protein powder for people who want their post-workout snack to taste like dessert. With flavors like Oreo, Cinnabon, and Chips Ahoy!, it's arguably one of the best-tasting whey proteins on the market. Each scoop delivers 26 grams of protein (50 percent of daily value) and blends well in shakes, oats, or even DIY protein ice cream. The trade-off here is a longer ingredient list that includes gums, high-fructose corn syrup, and titanium dioxide—a whitening pigment banned as a food additive in Europe.
Wavelength Vanilla Protein Powder for $55: In addition to 20 grams of pea protein per serving, Wavelength's plant-based powder boasts trendy adaptogens and nootropics like maca root, ashwagandha, and Chaga mushroom extract. The brand doesn't disclose how much of each is in the mix, so it's hard to say if they're doing much beyond adding to the price tag. The taste is deeply earthy, which makes it better suited for baking than chugging. Wavelength also makes Little Ripples, a protein powder formulated for kids, but we haven't tested it yet.
Aloha 12oz Chocolate Sea Salt Protein Drink (Pack of 12) for $33: Aloha's protein powder is still on my testing docket, but I have tried the brand's ready-to-drink shakes. The chocolate sea salt is surprisingly tasty; it's creamy and rich, but there's a faint aftertaste. I sometimes use the vanilla flavor as a milk base for smoothies, and there's also a coconut flavor I haven't gotten my hands on yet. Each serving packs 20 grams of plant-based protein.
BSN True-Mass Weight Gainer, Muscle Mass Gainer Protein Powder for $83: If you're trying to bulk up or struggle to hit your calorie goals, BSN True Mass is worth considering. This mass gainer packs 1,200 calories per serving, with 50 grams of protein and 215 grams of carbohydrates. Its protein blend includes whey concentrate, casein, milk protein isolate, whey protein isolate, hydrolyzed whey isolate, and micellar casein, so you get a mix of fast and slow-digesting proteins. It also delivers 450 milligrams of calcium and 880 milligrams of potassium, which is a bonus if you want to squeeze in some micronutrients. It tastes great—the strawberry milkshake flavor is spot-on—but these are two scoops at 310 grams, so you'll need to be comfortable with the jumbo serving size. I can't fully endorse the formula because it's packed with artificial sweeteners like sucralose and acesulfame potassium, as well as some iffy additives including maltodextrin and a gum blend (cellulose, guar, gum Arabic, and xanthan) that might not sit well with everyone. If you have a sensitive stomach, you might want to pass. This one brings protein farts to a new level.
Beast Mega 1200 for $199: If you're looking to level up your smoothie game, Mega's 1,200-watt motor cuts through frozen fruit, powders, and fibrous foods with an ease that personal blenders can't match. One button, a timed cycle, and consistent chunk-free results. The three included Tritan vessels are designed with ribbed interiors that boost turbulence for silkier smoothies. Plus, the drinking lid and straw system transforms your blender into a travel cup without the extra dishes. It's available in five colors—cloud white, carbon black, navy, sand, sage, and charcoal—and backed by a two-year warranty.
Vitamix Ascent X5 for $750: The Vitamix Ascent X5 is expensive, but if you're in the market for an all-purpose blender, this is the one that makes smoothies feel like an art form. It's got 10 preset programs (smoothie bowls, nut butters, nondairy milks, and more), which means your protein recipes can get as creative as you want. It has a tamper for the thickest of shakes, and the on-screen indicator tells you exactly when to step in. Plus, if your blend needs more mixing, hit the “add 15 seconds” button. The self-cleaning mode is my favorite feature; it's not groundbreaking, but I'd rather gouge my eyes out with a dull chopstick than scrub post-smoothie gunk off a blender. Plus, it's backed by a 10-year warranty, which makes it an investment worth considering.
Ninja Blast Portable Blender for $53: Finally, for an affordable option, you might want to consider Ninja's tiny portable blender, which charges via USB-C. The motor isn't super powerful, and the battery isn't long-lived (one charge lasts long enough to thoroughly blend one yogurt smoothie with frozen berries), but this blender is affordable, the vessel and lid are dishwasher-safe, and it's tiny enough to have a permanent home on editor Adrienne So's counter. She has been using this daily for a year to make morning smoothies from Greek yogurt, milk, and frozen berries and bananas with no issues.

﻿Copilot’s Actions feature can book car rentals, concert tickets, and restaurant tables so you don’t have to.
by  Jess Weatherbed
Microsoft is making changes to Copilot that will allow the artificial intelligence assistant to complete online tasks for you. Using “simple chat prompts,” these “Actions” can be performed in the background while you work on other tasks, according to Microsoft, and can do things like book restaurant reservations, event tickets, and purchase items to ship to your friends.
Launch partners include Booking.com, Expedia, Kayak, Tripadvisor, Skyscanner, Viater, Vrbo, and Priceline — a host of travel and vacation-focused services that will allow Copilot to help users plan any upcoming trips — alongside Open Table for meals, and 1-800-Flowers.com for buying floral arrangements. Microsoft says that Copilot’s Actions feature will “work with most websites across the web,” and can sort out “the ride home” for you after events, suggesting it will also support taxi or ride-sharing services.
Actions is launching alongside other personalization features like a tool that turns online content into AI-generated podcasts, another for buying and finding deals on products, and the ability for Copilot to see and react to things on your camera. Microsoft hasn’t gone into any detail about how Actions will work, but it’s a similar concept to features that have already been announced by other AI providers. 
Amazon launched its Nova Act AI agent in March that’s capable of performing tasks in a user’s browser, such as searching the web, purchasing products online, and answering questions about what’s on the screen. OpenAI has its own spin on this called Operator, Google has Project Mariner, and Anthropic released a “computer use” beta feature for its Claude 3.5 Sonnet AI model in October that can autonomously click around and perform online tasks.
Those similar solutions are largely still in development or early access, however. By contrast, Microsoft says it’s rolling out the initial version of Copilot’s Actions feature starting today, with availability expanding “in the coming weeks and months” subject to platform, market, and language. That makes it one of the first automatic task-performing AI services to hit the general public, and could give us an early indication of how practical or reliable these types of AI partner tools are to use.

24,2025-04-04,"Nintendo says it will no longer open pre-orders for the Switch 2 in the United States next week, following the introduction of steep tariffs on exports from Japan.
The firm unveiled the much-anticipated console on Wednesday, the same day US President Donald Trump announced his sweeping new global tariffs.
It said then that US pre-orders would open in a matter of days, but it has been now been forced to revise its plans.
""Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the US will not start April 9 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,"" it said in a statement.
It says it still intends to launch the console on June 5, as originally planned.
Nintendo confirmed the announcement applies to the US market only, so UK pre-orders will not be affected.
Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.
Japan, where the gaming company is based, has been hit with a 24% tariff - a cost which the firm must swallow or pass onto consumers.
Trump says that his global tariffs will boost the US economy and protect jobs - but Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba called them a ""national crisis"" on Friday according to local media.
""The government will do its utmost to respond to this crisis, involving the entire country,"" he said.
The decision may raise concerns amongst fans that Nintendo could be considering a change in prices in the US.
The cost of the console's games has already emerged as an area of concern.
On Wednesday, it revealed the Switch 2 would cost $449.99 in the US, with a physical copy of its big game Mario Kart World coming in at $79.99 - though it can be purchased for less if bought with the console.
It is not known whether Nintendo factored potential tariffs into its original pricing - though, even if it did, it is unlikely it would have expected the rate to be as high as the 24% announced by Trump.
The BBC gets hands-on with the hotly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2, launching in June.

The agency has reams of nonpublic business information and oversees Elon Musk’s X.
by  Lauren Feiner and  Alex Heath
Two members of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) were spotted at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) this week, sources tell The Verge.
Gavin Kliger and Emily Bryant were seen in the building and are now listed in the FTC’s internal directory under the Office of the Chairman with their own agency emails, according to the sources. FTC spokesperson Joe Simonson told Axios, which first reported the news, that DOGE is there “to root out waste, fraud and abuse.”
It’s unclear what DOGE will target now that it is under the hood of the FTC. It’s a fairly lean agency with fewer than 1,200 employees tasked with consumer protection and antitrust enforcement. A small number of probationary workers were cut earlier this year. FTC chair Andrew Ferguson has already made clear that he believes regulatory agencies should operate under the control of the president, not as the independent bodies they’ve traditionally been.

The agency has access to a vast trove of nonpublic information on businesses it investigates and studies, including material for an upcoming antitrust trial against Meta. Much of the FTC’s case records are physically stored onsite, while documents obtained through discovery are hosted on a platform called Relativity, according to one source.
Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, one of the two Democratic FTC commissioners whom Trump has attempted to fire in violation of decades of Supreme Court precedent, recently pointed out that the agency “has some of the most commercially sensitive financial data of businesses throughout the economy.” During a panel at the American Bar Association on Thursday, she said it would be “very illegal” and “concerning” if such data was “accessed by other market participants.”
The FTC has active oversight of Musk’s businesses. X, for example, is under a long-running consent decree with the agency as a result of how Twitter mishandled user data before Musk purchased the social network. He recently endorsed the idea of stripping away the FTC’s authority to enforce antitrust law by consolidating that power in the Department of Justice, which already coordinates with the FTC on which antitrust cases to pursue.

The world's top 10 richest people saw $74 billion vanish on paper after this week's market rout, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs on Wednesday afternoon triggered market chaos. Stocks suffered their worst single-day loss in five years on Thursday. The S&P 500 dropped nearly 5%, the Dow lost 1,679 points, and the Nasdaq composite plunged 6%.
    

        Here's how much the wealthiest have lost since the tariff announcement and how it compares to their net worth, per Bloomberg:
    

-$11.0 billion ( -2.5%)


Elon Musk has seen his net worth fluctuate wildly over the past several weeks, as his involvement with the White House DOGE office has drawn public ire and boycotts against Tesla, sending Tesla's stock down.
    

Musk's wealth largely comes from his stake in Tesla, but he is also the CEO of X/Twitter, Neuralink, the Boring Company, and SpaceX. He's worth $322 billion, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, making him the world's richest person.
    

-$15.9 billion ( -6.7%)


Bezos is the founder and executive chairman of Amazon, and he is worth $201 billion. He also owns The Washington Post, which he purchased in 2013. Bezos stepped down as Amazon's CEO in 2021.
    

-$17.9 billion ( -8.6%)


Mark Zuckerberg has been facing criticism over rolling back fact-checking on Meta platforms, including Facebook, Threads, and Instagram, and replacing that with ""community notes.""
    

        Zuckerberg is the cofounder, chairman, and CEO of Meta, putting him at a net worth of $189 billion.
    

-$2.57 billion ( -1.8%)


        Warren Buffett, with a net worth of $165 billion, is the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, a multinational conglomerate holding company. Through Berkshire, Buffett owns a wide range of businesses, including GEICO, BNSF Railway, and Dairy Queen.
    

        Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding is Apple, which makes up around 20% of its portfolio.
    

-$6.22 billion ( -3.5%)


        Bernard Arnault is the chairman and CEO of LVMH, the world's largest luxury goods conglomerate. The majority of his $163 billion comes from his stake in LVMH, which owns over 75 brands across fashion, cosmetics, jewelry, and spirits, including Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Mot & Chandon.
    

        LVMH has been reporting declining sales under dampened consumer sentiments in multiple countries.
    

-$291 million ( -0.2%)


Bill Gates is the cofounder of Microsoft, though he stepped down from the company's board in 2020 and now owns only a small percentage of its shares. Most of his $162 billion in wealth is managed through Cascade Investment, a private firm that holds major stakes in companies like the Four Seasons Hotels.
    

        Gates also runs the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a philanthropy organization that supports global health, education, and climate initiatives.
    

-$8.10 billion ( -4.2%)


        Larry Ellison is the cofounder, executive chairman, and chief technology officer of Oracle, one of the world's largest software and cloud computing companies. With a net worth of $160 billion, Ellison is also a major investor in Tesla and owns a large portion of Lanai, a Hawaiian island.
    

        Ellison, along with OpenAI's Sam Altman and SoftBank's Masayoshi Son, are also spearheading Project Stargate, a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative supported by Trump.
    

-$4.79 billion ( -2.9%)


Larry Page is the cofounder of Google and a board member of its parent company, Alphabet. While he stepped down as Alphabet's CEO in 2019, he remains a major shareholder and influential figure, with a net worth of $138 billion.
    

        Page is also a major backer of Kitty Hawk and Opener, companies that are developing electric flying vehicles.
    

-$2.85 billion ( -1.9%)


        Steve Ballmer is the former CEO of Microsoft, a role he held from 2000 to 2014. He remains one of the company's largest individual shareholders, with a net worth of $131 billion.
    

        Outside Microsoft, Ballmer also owns the Los Angeles Clippers, an NBA team he purchased in 2014 for $2 billion.
    

-$4.46 billion ( -2.8%)


Sergey Brin is the cofounder of Google and played a key role in developing its early search algorithms. He served as president of Alphabet until stepping down in 2019.
    

        Like Page, Brin retains significant influence at Alphabet through his Class B shares. Most of his $130 billion net worth is tied to Alphabet stock.

27,2025-04-04,"[Morten] works very fast. He has already designed, fabbed, populated, and tested a breakout board for the new tiniest microcontroller on the market, and he’s even made a video about it, embedded below.
You might have heard about this new TI ARM Cortex MO micro on these very pages, where we asked you what you’d do with this grain-of-rice-sized chunk of thinking sand. (The number one answer was “sneeze and lose it in the carpet”.)
From the video, it looks like [Morten] would design a breakout board using Kicad 8, populate it, get it blinking, and then use its I2C lines to make a simple digital thermometer demo. In the video, he shows how he worked with the part, from making a custom footprint to spending quite a while nudging it into place before soldering it carefully down.
But he nailed it on the first try, and honestly it doesn’t look nearly as intimidating as we’d feared, mostly because of the two-row layout of the balls. It actually looks easy enough to fan out. Because you can’t inspect the soldering work underneath the chip, he broke out all of the lines to a header to make it quick to check for shorts between those tiny little balls. Smart.
We love to see people trying out the newest hotness. Let us know down in the comments what new parts you’re trying out.


Thanks [Clint] for the tip!
Could have made a PCB the size of a DIP-8 package, then we could plug it into a breadboard.
^this………………………………………….
That’s my plan when I can get my hands on some. Still in preproduction and stock seems to be super limited.
I dunno what you’re searching for, but the plug and play dev kit is in stock at Mouser for $8 a unit.
I got one direct from TI, it has a much larger MSPM0 mcu on it. Fine for development but I still want to make a DIP-8 adapter for the smallest MCU. Why? IDK it’s funny I guess. Software 555 Emulator?
Idea: Also add castellations on the outside, so it can be soldered on another PCB without additional connectors.
Or ya know… just order it in any of these available packages.
20-pin TSSOP (PW)
20-pin VSSOP (DGS)
20-pin WQFN (RUK)
16-pin SOT (DYY)
8-pin SOT (DDF)
8-pin WSON (DSG)
Indeed. It’s quite silly to fumble with “the world’s smallest microcontroller” and then put it on a big empty PCB like that. If you want to experiment with small stuff, then the “soldering challenge” boards with different sized LED’s are a much better option.
For KiCad, it does not matter. It works with nano meter resolution, and with that it’s has more resolution than any PCB manufacturer or SMT placement machine has.
Also, KiCad used to work with 32 bit integers, which resulted in a maximum PCB size of (approx) 4 by 4 meters. KiCad is transitioning to 64 bit integers (Either in V9 or planned for V10), which results any practical limit for maximum PCB size.
Who makes a 4m x 4m PCB, and how do they post them?
This. Thanks for the chuckle 😁
Most irrelevant tick box ever, especially for hackers.
Great….
Has that thing got enough i/o pins to layout a few hundred of them in an isometric grid? Imagine that with the right code running on it to simulate a neural network in a way that can be reconfigurable via command messages passed through the mesh along with the data flowing through it to be processed.
The only use case I can think of for this MCU is making very small software controlled SMPS boards with special features. Precharge for highly capacitive loads, programmable frequency control for max efficiency, remote sensing, control over I2C or whatever bus etc
I think wearables are probably a big market. I’ve seen lots of smart rings around lately.
Hardware implants, here we goooo!
Waiting for an arduino integration, then i’ll buy some
945 page datasheet, 15 page silicon errata – I dunno. Cute but simplicity is not there.
I just find the time required to learn and roll with these parts is too much. Other engineers stick to what MCU’s/IDE they already know, so they can hit the ground designing right away instead of the boss yelling “are you done yet?” while you are reading 100’s of pages of new data and pray you don’t run into some deal-breaker new bug in the part.

28,2025-04-04,"India is a cricket-crazy nation, and it seems the AI chatbot ChatGPT hasn't missed that fact.
So, when its founder Sam Altman fed it the prompt: ""Sam Altman as a cricket player in anime style"", the bot seems to have immediately generated an image of Altman wielding a bat in a bright blue India jersey. 
Altman shared his anime cricketer avatar on X on Thursday, sending Indian social media users into a tizzy. 
Though the tech billionaire had shared AI-generated images before -  joining last week's viral Studio Ghibli trend - it was the India jersey that got people talking.
While some Indian users said they were delighted to see Altman sporting their team's colours, many were quick to speculate about his motives behind sharing the image.
""Sam trying hard to attract Indian customers,"" one user said. 
""Now awaiting your India announcement. How much are you allocating out of that $40bn to India,"" another user asked, alluding to the record funding recently secured by Altman for his firm, OpenAI, which owns ChatGPT.
Yet another user put into words a pattern he seemed to have spotted in Altman's recent social media posts - and a question that seems to be on many Indian users' minds.
""Over the past few days, you've been praising India and Indian customers a lot. How did this sudden love for India come about? It feels like there's some deep strategy going on behind the scenes,"" he wrote on X.
While the comment may sound a bit conspiratorial, there's some truth to at least part of it.
Just hours before Altman shared his image in the cricket jersey, he'd shared a post on X praising India's adoption of AI technology. He said it was ""amazing to watch"" and that it was ""outpacing the world"".
This post too went viral in India, while the media wrote numerous stories documenting users' reactions to it. 
Someone even started a Reddit thread which quite comically aired the Redditor's curiosity, and perhaps, confusion.
""Can someone tell me what Sam Altman is talking about here in his tweet?"" the person posted on Reddit sharing Altman's post.
A few days earlier, Altman had retweeted Studio Ghibli-style images of Prime Minister Narendra Modi which were shared by the federal government's citizen engagement platform.
All these posts of Altman have generated a fair amount of comments questioning his motives.
The scepticism around Altman's perceived courting of India could be because of his past views on the country's AI capabilities.
During a visit in 2023, he had sounded almost dismissive of small Indian start-ups making AI tools that could compete with OpenAI's creations.
Asked at a event how a small, smart team with a low budget of about $10m could build substantial AI foundational models, he answered that it would be ""totally hopeless"" to attempt this but that entrepreneurs should try anyway.
But when Altman visited India again this year, he had changed his tune.
In a meeting with federal minister Ashwini Vaishnaw in February, Altman expressed an eagerness to collaborate with India on making low-cost AI models.
He also praised India for its swift pace of adopting AI technologies and revealed that the country was OpenAI's second-largest market, with users tripling over the past year.
The praise comes even as his company is locked in a legal battle with some of India's biggest news media companies over the alleged unauthorised use of their content.
Experts say that Altman's seemingly newfound affinity for India might have to do with the country's profitability as a market.
According to the International Trade Administration, the AI market in India is projected to reach $8bn by 2025, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 40% from 2020 to 2025.
Nikhil Pahwa, founder-editor of MediaNama.com, a technology policy website, says that when it comes to founders of AI companies making ""grand statements"" about India, it has much to do with the country's massive user base. He adds that Altman isn't the only CEO wooing India.
In January, Aravind Srinivas, founder of Perplexity, an AI search engine, also expressed an eagerness to work with Indian AI start-ups.
Mr Srinivas said in a post on X that he was ready to invest $1m and five hours of his time per week to ""make India great again in the context of AI"".
Technology writer Prasanto K Roy believes that the Ghibli-trend revealed India's massive userbase for ChatGPT and, potentially, other AI platforms as well. And with competitor AI models like Gemini and Grok quickly gaining Indian users, Altman may be keen to retain existing users of his firm's services and also acquire new ones, he says.
""India is a very large client base for all global AI foundational models and with ChatGPT being challenged by the much cheaper DeepSeek AI, Altman is likely eager to acquire more Indian customers and keep Indian developers positively aligned towards building on top of OpenAI's services,"" Mr Pahwa says.
""So when it comes to these grand overtures towards India, there's no real love; it's just business,"" he adds.
India fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah is set to make his return to competitive cricket in the Indian Premier League after three months out injured.
Carys Harding is watched by thousands as she tidies her home as part of a trend known as a ""reset"".
Gangetic and Indus river dolphins are found in over two-dozen rivers in India.
Batteries for electric vehicles are notoriously difficult to recycle, but growing demand for the rare metals they contain is leading to innovative new ways of retrieving them.
The president has granted the app a second 75-day extension to comply with a law that requires it to either sell its US assets or face a ban.

29,2025-04-04,"
    Here are the top six questions I'm getting from homebuyers right now.
  
Economic uncertainty seems to be the only certainty these days. A barrage of tariffs threatens higher prices and a trade war, while a plunging stock market and federal job slashing seem to be clear recession indicators. With mortgage rates inching lower, it's common for homebuyers to ask if housing will become more affordable in a downturn. 
After more than 20 years in real estate, I've seen my share of market fluctuations, from boom times to full-blown crashes, like 2008. The truth is there's always an opportunity for certain homebuyers, regardless of how messy the economy is. The market doesn't stop during a recession. It just shifts. If you're financially ready, that shift can actually work in your favor.
Let's look at what a recession really means for mortgage rates, whether home prices will fall and when it's a good time to buy a home. 
There are many recession warning signs right now. Layoffs are picking up, GDP is slowing and consumer confidence has dipped. Paychecks aren't going as far, and retirement accounts are taking hits. 
While less disposable income and tighter budgets point to a general slowdown in the economy, technically, we're not in a recession yet. It would take two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth to hit that definition. But for a lot of folks, it already feels like one. 
Even if the inflation rate isn't going up, the cost of everyday goods and services is still high, and budgets are getting hammered. When folks feel the squeeze every time they swipe a card at the grocery store, it shapes how they think about making huge purchases like a home.
Borrowing costs have been expensive for the last several years, making households and businesses wary about taking out loans. The Federal Reserve will probably cut interest rates again later this year, eventually making financing cheaper. 
But those cuts likely won't come until summer. The Fed's a bit stuck right now. The economy's losing steam and inflation is cooling, but not fast enough. The central bank is being cautious about shifting policy, especially with tariffs driving prices back up.
Though lower interest rates will eventually impact the housing market, the Fed doesn't directly control mortgage rates. Mortgage rates move based on many factors, such as the bond market and investor expectations. Even when the Fed starts cutting rates again, don't expect mortgage rates to drop like crazy. Many of those expected cuts are already priced into the market. 
Mortgage rates often fall during an economic depression, as we saw recently in 2020 and earlier in 2008. Lower rates help boost the economy, and the Fed knows that.
But this time around, things are messier. There's volatility everywhere. Even though rates could drop, they might also shoot back up with any good economic news. Like many experts in the real estate industry, I think average rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage will hover between 6.5% to 7.25% for most of 2025, with weekly jumps and dips in that range. 
If you're holding out for 4% or 5% mortgage rates, you may be waiting longer than you'd like. It's going to take far more negative economic news to see rates fall significantly.
It's also worth pointing out that your personal financial situation matters more than your interest rate. If you've got a solid stream of income and a long-term plan for paying off a home loan, waiting for a perfect rate might not be worth it.
After years of steady growth, home prices could hypothetically crash if the bubble bursts. But in today's housing market, real estate prices won't likely go down in a big way.
Historically, home prices don't actually fall much during recessions. The 2008 housing crash was the exception, not the rule. What we'll probably see is slower appreciation or small dips in certain markets, especially in areas hit by higher insurance costs, taxes or natural disasters (Florida, Texas and Louisiana come to mind). We could see home prices drop in some areas of the country as supply goes up. 
But nationwide, we're still dealing with low inventory. Until that changes, it's hard to see prices dropping dramatically. Plus, given high construction and labor costs, it's clear home prices aren't bottoming out anytime soon.
If you're financially stable, it could be cheaper to buy a home in a recession. You might find better deals, less competition and more negotiating power. But if lending tightens, getting a loan could get tougher. That's something we're already starting to see with condos and certain types of properties.
There's also the ""wealth effect."" When people feel wealthier, like when their stock portfolio or home value is up, they're more confident making big purchases. But when those numbers start to slide, or there's even a threat of job insecurity, even if nothing's really changed day to day, people pull back. Economic turbulence affects buyer activity in a big way. If someone just lost $20,000 in their 401(k), they're not rushing to get a new mortgage.
The best time to buy a home is when it makes sense for you. If you've got a steady income and strong credit, and you're ready to settle down, an economic downturn in the housing market could actually work in your favor. 
Just don't wait around for some magical ""perfect time"" to take out a mortgage. The green light most people are waiting for doesn't exist. If you prepare, stay informed and work with the right team, you can make a smart move no matter what the economy is doing."
30,2025-04-04,"Nintendo is officially pushing the preorder date for Switch 2 customers in the U.S. The company cited uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs as the main cause for the delay, though the legacy Japanese game maker promised the June 5 launch date is still in effect.
In a statement sent to Gizmodo, Nintendo said âPre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025, in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.â
Nintendo shared all the details about the $450 Switch 2âs features, price, and launch date during the official Switch 2 Direct on April 2, the same day that Trump announced sweeping tariffs hitting practically every country in the world, including Nintendoâs reported hardware manufacturing bases of Cambodia and Vietnam, as identified by The Financial Times. Some analysts who spoke to Gizmodo previously said Nintendo likely calculated the cost of tariffs into its Switch 2 price point. Still, the company was hit hard by Trumpâs arbitrary import tax scheme. President Donald Trump put a 46% tariff on Vietnam and a 49% tariff on Cambodia.
Nintendo has repeatedly promised investors it has prepared its manufacturing to have enough Switch 2 units to beat scalpers. The new question is if it needs to adjust pricing to make up for the absolute skyrocketing price of shipping units to the U.S. Some analysts claimed Nintendo has brought close to 400,000 units to the U.S. before the tariffs hit, but preorder numbers could easily eclipse that, and just in the U.S. alone.
Nintendo sold 13.4 million original Switch systems globally during its release year in 2017, according to Omdia data. The analytics firm forecasted the company would sell 14.7 million Switch 2s this year, though that wasnât accounting for the impact of tariffs.
This story is ongoing, and we will be updating this page as we learn more.

The AI assistant adds personalization, web actions, podcast creation, and more.
by  Dominic Preston
As it marks its 50th anniversary, Microsoft is updating Copilot with a host of new features all at once that bring it more in line with alternatives like ChatGPT or Claude. The AI assistant, which uses many OpenAI models, now supports memory, personalization, web-based actions, podcast creation, camera and screen analysis, deep research, and even more.
With Memory, Copilot will now be able to keep track of your preferences, interests, and details like your birthday, and use the information to tailor responses and advice or make proactive suggestions. Microsoft says that users can choose what information they want Copilot to remember, or opt out entirely.
It’s part of an ongoing effort to make Copilot more personal. Microsoft says that the company is “early in this thinking,” but that “soon” you’ll be able to give Copilot a personalized appearance — and yes, that does include the option to bring back Clippy.
“Copilot is more than an AI, it’s yours,” says Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman. “Each will have its own unique style and blend of attributes that distinctly suit each and every one of us.”
Beyond personalization, Copilot is getting more powerful. A new Actions feature gives the AI the ability to carry out tasks using a web browser, similar to OpenAI’s Operator agent or Amazon’s recently announced Nova Act model. Microsoft suggests it could be used to book show tickets, reserve restaurants, and make purchases, especially when combined with new shopping functionality that sees Copilot research products and look for discounts and sales.
Copilot Vision, which began rolling out in the web tool in December 2024, is now expanding to the Windows and mobile apps. On Windows, Copilot will be able to “see” what’s on your screen across other apps and files to answer questions or interact with files and content, while on iOS and Android it will be able to discuss anything that’s visible from your phone camera, or the photos in your camera roll.
Deep Research allows Copilot to analyze large numbers of documents or online sources for complex projects, and its research abilities are being integrated with Bing to deliver AI-powered responses inside the search engine. Like other AI tools, Copilot can also now use its research to generate podcast-style audio to explain a topic, while a new Pages feature allows it to organize notes and research across documents into a single canvas.
Microsoft says that many of the new features are rolling out starting today in “initial versions,” and improving “in the coming weeks and months,” with availability varying by feature, platform, and market. None of these features are firsts — ChatGPT added memory features last year, Google Gemini has a vision mode, and absolutely every AI company wants to build personalized AI agents — but adding them all at once shows that Microsoft is committed to keeping up with the competition, not to mention getting the most out of its investment in OpenAI.
Update, April 4th: Added confirmation that Clippy will be a Copilot personalization option.

One of Wall Street’s best-known traders said there was “blood on the streets” at the New York Stock Exchange as the markets dealt with the worst day since COVID amid President Trump’s trade war.
Peter Tuchman, known as the ‘Einstein of Wall Street’ due to his distinctive hairstyle, joined CNN’s Erin Burnett to discuss the mood on the floor after the Trump administration’s “Liberation Day” tariffs sent markets into freefall.
Tuchman described a pervading sense of dread amongst traders as the true scope of the tariffs began to be felt and admitted that his initial predictions about what the president would do were utterly wrong.

“In an odd way, we are in a moment of history,” said Burnett as she asked Tuchman his thoughts on the day’s trade.
“No doubt,” he responded, adding that the last time the mood on the trading floor had been so low was “probably the beginning days of COVID, where you just had a sort of darkness around the room, and today was clearly that.”
Tuchman said he ran into Jim Cramer backstage and was reminded of the Mad Money host’s infamous “they know nothing” rant from 2007, in which he blasted the federal reserve for ignoring the upcoming signs of the forthcoming financial crisis.
“I was reminded [of Cramer’s rant] and thought I was going to come out here and do the exact same thing,” Tuchman said. “Because it’s unbelievable. They know nothing. And the formula they used for these numbers yesterday to measure the trade deficit, it’s like ‘apples, oranges, a couple of cashews, divided by ten, times four’—none of it makes any sense.”
The trader also admitted he thought until the very last minute that Trump was going to “lay it all out” and that there was going to be a “big reveal” which would calm the markets which have been battered by weeks of uncertainty around the president’s tariff plans. 
“I could not have been more wrong,” he confessed. “Today’s sell-off was not even a capitulation, it was a devastating day on the market—blood on the streets in my opinion.”
Cramer, who spoke to Burnett after Tuchman, echoed similar sentiments. 
“I feel like a sucker tonight because I am not a free trader and I do not believe in free trade. And I was just as tough, if not tougher, than his people,” he told the host.
“But they screwed it up and they really made—they did it in a totally ill-advised way. And I was very let down as someone who really, truly believes that free trade is awful for the American working person. This is what they came up with? Jeez, come on! Have some gumption. Have some math.”

The US economy added 228,000 jobs in March, far surpassing the forecast, and unemployment unexpectedly jumped.

        Job growth was expected to be 137,000, and the unemployment rate was expected to hold steady at 4.1%. Unemployment instead rose to 4.2%, and has consistently been at least 4% for almost a year.
    

        February's job growth was revised from 151,000 to 117,000, and January's job growth was revised from 125,000 to 111,000. Together, that's a revision of 48,000 fewer jobs.
    

        Federal government employment fell by 4,000 in March. DOGE and its unofficial leader Elon Musk have pushed for large-scale federal employment cuts, with a wave of terminations for probationary workers, who were in their roles for only a short period of time, coming in February and early March.
    

        However, a court ruling put a hold on many of those cuts, and the bulk of those workers remain in legal limbo.
    

        Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said that things are changing quickly in the economy. ""It shows us that there's still some strength in the labor market, but it ignores a lot of what we have seen recently, especially with the Liberation Day tariffs and some feelings around that and potential impacts that they may have on business decisions going forward,"" Stahle said.
    

        Agencies have begun developing more extensive plans to reduce the size of their workforces. Thousands of workers at agencies in the Department of Health and Human Services are expected to see their jobs cut; terminations started Tuesday.
    

        Workers at other agencies are bracing for what's next. Federal government cuts will likely affect the overall job counts in future releases.
    

        The new jobs report also showed wage growth cooled based on year-over-year changes. Average hourly earnings increased from $34.67 in March 2024 to $36 this past month. That 3.8% rise is a slower increase than the 4% year-over-year rise in February.
    

        Amid the rise in unemployment, labor force participation, which includes people working or actively looking for work, increased from 62.4% in February to 62.5% in March.
    

        Stahle said if you were to look at just the number of jobs added in March, you would ""say this is a labor market that's on fire,"" but when you look at the different job market metrics together, it shows a strong job market that has still cooled down.
    

        Americans have been losing confidence in the US economy, adding to an emerging vibecession amid a cooling but still fairly strong labor market.
    

        University of Michigan data shows consumer sentiment has declined for the year's first three months. The Conference Board's Present Situation Index, which is based on what people think about business and job market conditions, took a hit, data up to March shows. Consumers aren't feeling great about what's to come, either.
    

        ""Consumers' expectations were especially gloomy, with pessimism about future business conditions deepening and confidence about future employment prospects falling to a 12-year low,"" Stephanie Guichard, senior economist for global indicators at The Conference Board, said.
    

        The Federal Reserve uses labor market data as a key input for its interest rate decisions. Fed chair Jerome Powell said in a press conference on March 19 after the Federal Open Market Committee decided to hold interest rates steady that unemployment ""remains low and has held in a narrow range for the past year,"" and wage growth is surpassing inflation.
    

        The next scheduled interest rate decision is in May, meaning plenty more data about economic activity will be available before the Committee makes its next call.
    

        CME FedWatch, which estimates the likelihood of future Fed moves based on market trades, shows the chance of rates holding steady or being cut in May is roughly a coin toss. Chances of the Fed holding rose slightly after the report, from about 56% to about 61%.
    

        Powell said in the March press conference after the interest rate decision that the administration is making big changes to trade, immigration, fiscal policy, and regulation and is uncertain about what this will mean for the economy. Trump announced on April 2 his latest tariff plans, which could mean consumers could soon face higher prices.
    

        ""We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance, and we are well-positioned to wait for greater clarity,"" Powell said.

You're mixing up usefulness and innovation. AI isn't creating anything on its own, but it's making the process of creation faster. It's just a tool that makes people a little more efficient at what they do. If I have a task to do, such as writing code, and AI can spit out boilerplate code for me that I can just build on, then that made me more efficient at my work.Yes, sometimes it spits out garbage, but with time and experience one learns how to wrangle it and get it to spit out useful bits, and that's pre 
AlphaFold2 is the most obvious example. It was validated to work properly, but the required validation work is nothing compared to the work it saved by predicting folding of hundreds of millions proteins, which each take about half a year of work. If you are not familiar of AlphaFold2, I suggest finding a video or story about it, because I think it is much bigger thing than landing to the Moon was.

What do you think how the text to speech system the hotlines use work? There are also many use-cases for OCR that are not more validated than using a simple spellchecker to detect misrecognized words (which are rare with AI based OCR). Many segmentation tasks don't need correction, but the interesting ones usually nevertheless have control, because many of these tasks are too important to not have a human check it.
I do software development with AI assistance every day now and it frequently works quite well. It often saves me hours or even days. I've seen very large improvements in the capabilities of AI just over the past few months. An enormous difference over the past year.
50+ years ago they said computers would replace all our jobs. Also, robots, will replace us. And FSD, drones, crypto, automated checkouts, online music, Japan, China, immigrants, Communists, Jews, fast food, no God in schools, books describing sex acts, Swifties, etc; They are all threats and we should be scared. At least, that's what we're being told by the ""experts"".
And people still have work. Some even to keep the computers running.
Speak for yourself.  Most of the people I know (and I was working for a F500 company, and the only reason I have a job is because of who knows me) are out of work.  I know people who were making $300k/year at the start of 2024 doing mall Santas come Christmas.
Jobs are an exception, not the rule.  Yes, it is fun to make fun of the schmuck who blew his brains out because he couldn't afford the payments on his BMW, but this is getting to be past 2020 with so many people out of work, maybe even heading for 1980 
You've moved the goalpost. You're not talking about the jobs the robots made obsolete in this post.Even though I think in Futurama there were a robot santa I am not sure if it were in the mall. ;)

37,2025-04-04,"What was that about keeping politics out of games?
by  Zoë Hannah
Nintendo’s Switch 2 ramp-up week started with a cheerful bang (a jingle, really) at Wednesday’s Switch 2 Direct that revealed the sleek new console’s release date, launch games, and features. Donkey Kong hype abounded online, at least until the company’s news releases started trickling out to outlets like Polygon, and sticker shock took over. Nintendo announced it would charge $450 for its console and $80 for its flagship game, Mario Kart World (or $500 for the two bundled together).
Around the same time, President Trump announced his sweeping global trade plan, which included significant tariffs for virtually every country in the world — including uninhabited regions. To put it simply, everyone began freaking the fuck out in response, and the stock market did, too. In the news and on social media, both “Switch 2” and “Trump tariffs” began trending, marking the beginning of a very chaotic 48 hours in which the release of a highly anticipated game console and the blundering whims of the U.S. president became inextricably linked not just for the folks who care about games, but for consumers of other mainstream media, too.
The tariffs will impact the cost of almost everything Americans purchase, all amidst stocks plummeting downward and social services getting dismantled. That might include the cost of Switch 2 — a price that a lot of people weren’t happy about before Nintendo announced it would delay pre-orders due to “tariffs and evolving market conditions.” Panic has ensued for fans: What if the Switch 2 is even more expensive than $450? That’s on top of this other bit of lurking dread: What if there aren’t enough Switch 2s to go around?
Business professor and author Joost van Dreunen said in an email to Polygon that Nintendo’s “explicit reference to tariffs” in its statement is highly unusual for the company, and for Japanese corporate posturing in general. “Japanese companies traditionally avoid commenting on foreign policy matters, making this directness particularly noteworthy. By specifically naming tariffs as the cause rather than using vaguer language about ‘supply chain challenges’ or ‘global market conditions,’ Nintendo is clearly signaling to shareholders and consumers that the delay stems from external policy decisions rather than internal planning failures.” (Polygon reached out to Nintendo for comment but did not hear back before press time.)
There have long been a vocal few in the gaming community who talk about “keeping politics out of games,” which is a senseless take devoid of critical thought to begin with. But that take has never been more senseless than it is right now: Trump’s trade war is, quite literally, impacting games. And Nintendo wants us to know it, too.
But it’s likely not because so many gamers’ favorite nostalgia manufacturer is taking a stand against the big bad along with us. It’s a strategic decision (though I wouldn’t be surprised if Nintendo’s execs privately despise Trump for this decision and maybe even others).
“It insulates Nintendo from criticism about their own execution while gently educating their consumer base about how trade policy directly impacts product availability and potentially pricing,” van Dreunen said. “The reference to ‘evolving market conditions’ gives them flexibility to make adjustments beyond just responding to tariffs, potentially including competitive positioning against the rumored PS5 Pro price drop or shifts in component availability.”
Trump’s newest round of tariffs include a hefty increase up to 46% for Vietnam, the location Nintendo moved much of its manufacturing to several years ago when Trump increased tariffs on China. But van Dreunen doesn’t think it’s too likely Nintendo will raise the price of Switch 2 so close to launch, which he says would be “unprecedented.”
“Nintendo needs time to assess whether their existing price point of $449.99 remains viable or if their projected margins have been compromised. The delay gives them flexibility to either secure additional inventory ahead of potential tariff implementation, explore manufacturing alternatives, or adjust their go-to-market strategy,” van Dreunen said. “More likely, Nintendo will maintain the announced price but potentially reduce initial production volume or adjust bundle offerings to preserve margins. They’re essentially buying time to make the most informed decision possible in a rapidly evolving trade environment.”
And while it’s tempting to take van Dreunen’s salient expertise here as a sign that it’s not all that bad, he also says the gaming industry tends to offer a decent pulse on the rest of the economy.
“Nintendo specifically makes an interesting barometer because their audience skews more mainstream and family-oriented than competitors, meaning their customer base includes the middle-income consumers most affected by economic headwinds,” van Dreunen said. “In this case, Nintendo’s response to these tariffs offers a preview of how global companies with complex supply chains will navigate increasing trade barriers – not by immediately passing costs to consumers, but by tactical delays and strategic reassessment. Their caution signals the broader uncertainty facing multinational companies as global trade tensions escalate.”
The only thing we know for sure is that a lot more uncertainty is coming our way.

Apple has some decisions to make.

        President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs on Wednesday that will disrupt the supply chain for many businesses. For Apple, the 54% tariff rate on China and a 46% tariff on Vietnam present a challenge: analysts estimate the vast majorityof its product line is made in the two countries.
    

        If things continue as they are now, Apple is on track to face $40 billion in tariff costs, Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett wrote in a note. The tech giant will have to decide if it will try to offset the fees by raising iPhone prices.
    

        Crockett and Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives predict a roughly 40% price increase on tech devices to ease the impact of the tariffs. iPhones could get more expensive at the same time that Apple is pushing for more demand. Apple shares were down more than 8% at market close following Trump's announcement — its largest one-day drop in five years.
    

        Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
    

        The iPhone 16 starts at $799. A 43% price increase, as Rosenblatt estimated, would bring it up to $1,142 before taxes — $50 cheaper than the most expensive iPhone in Apple's current lineup. For the top-of-the-line iPhone 16 Pro Max, which costs up to $1,599, a 43% bump would put it at just under $2,300, according to BI's calculations.
    

        Shifting production to the US likely won't save consumers either, Ives said. He estimates that an iPhone made in the US would cost $3,500. However, Crockett wrote that the shift isn't feasible for the immediate future.
    

        China swiftly clapped back at Trump's tariffs with its own on Friday. Beginning April 10, US imports to China will be charged a 34% tariff. It presents yet another challenge for Apple in the crucial Greater China market where it's faced increasing competition from local smartphone makers.

UPDATED with closing prices: U.S. stock markets went from bad to worse Friday, accelerating declines throughout the trading day to finish deeply in the red amid the shock of Donald Trump‘s tariff regime.

	The Dow Jones Industrial average fell 2,231.07 points, or 5.5%, to officially enter correction territory (meaning the blue-chip index is now more than 10% below its high). The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each plunged nearly 6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has fallen enough to be classified as being in a bear market, more than 20% below its high point. One of the Nasdaq’s crown jewels, Amazon, had its worst week since 2022 and the tech giant’s nine-week streak of weekly declines is its worst since 2008. 

	










	The two-day swoon for the markets was the worst since the Covid panic of March 2020. On-air personalities on CNBC and other financial outlets commenting on the free-fall invoked October 1987, when the Black Monday crash was preceded by dramatic drops on the preceding Thursday and Friday.




			Watch on Deadline		






	Trump’s sweeping tariffs, especially a 34% measure added to already-steep levies on China, has been the cause of the swoon. China also delivered an ominous signal to the market early Friday, saying it would retaliate by matching the 34% tariff on U.S. goods, rather than engaging in negotiations, as Trump and other officials had encouraged nations to do.

	Media shares were not spared from the reckoning. The declines were everywhere, with only AMC Entertainment lighting up green, up a fraction of a percentage point. (CinemaCon trade or another Reddit-led retail revolt? Hard to say.) Notable decliners included Disney (-6%), Warner Bros. Discovery (-12%), Comcast (-6.6%), Fox (-4%) and Nexstar (-8%). In the tech sector, Apple fell 7%, Meta dipped 5%, Amazon was off 4% and Roku gave back 8%.

	For the first time, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell weighed in on the tariffs, calling them “higher than anticipated,” while he added that it is “too soon to say” what course should be taken to respond to the market meltdown. The focus of Powell and the Fed is expected to shift from cooling inflation to trying to prevent a broader cratering of the economy, which had been in solid shape before Trump’s actions.

PREVIOUSLY, Friday AM: As Donald Trump’s tariffs showed increasing signs of escalating a trade war with China and perhaps several other nations, U.S. stock markets fell sharply for a second straight day Friday.

	










	The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,300 points and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each declined by almost 4% in early trading. The drop followed a Thursday market session that was the worst since the Covid panic of 2020 for the Nasdaq and S&P. Individual shares of large companies were hammered to an unusual extent as investors reacted to sweeping and higher-than-expected tariffs.

	Losses weren’t quite as dire as on Thursday for media and tech stocks, but the morning still signaled a glum end to a turbulent week. Apple shed 3%, Meta was off 4%, Disney fell 4% and Warner Bros Discovery was off by 7%. Amazon slipped just 1%, while Netflix tumbled 5%.

	China indicated that it would impose a 34% tariff on U.S. goods, matching the newest 34% one slapped on China by Trump. China’s defiant stance has sparked fears that countries will retaliate rather than negotiating with the U.S.

	Trump unveiled the tariffs Wednesday in a meandering White House Rose Garden news conference. Futures markets began sinking as he was talking. A baseline 10% reciprocal tariff was put in place on all trading partners, with varying country-specific rates. China, India, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam are slated to be hit with tariffs of 34%, 26%, 32%, 36%, and 46%, respectively. The European Union also faces a 20% tariff. The measures will take effect in stages over the next week.

	One of the odder sights on the board Friday was the green number for Newsmax, which stood out in a sea of red. The pro-Trump TV news network, which had its IPO earlier this week, rose 5% and has shot up more than 500% since going public. Rudy Giuliani, the disgraced former Trump lawyer and ex-New York City mayor, was on hand Thursday to help ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange along with other Newsmax backers.

Nice economy you have there, said President Donald Trump’s administration. It would be a shame if something happened to it.
The something, announced earlier this week, is a set of globally applied tariffs that make no sense on their face. No sane economist would endorse this. Through a combination of stupidity, incompetence and sheer gangsterism, the Trump administration has decided to levy a series of taxes that encourage blatant corruption, entirely fail to encourage American manufacturing growth, and leave people and companies poorer. That is, assuming that the taxes come into play at all.
“This is the craziest of the crazy things we’ve seen thus far.”
The central, persistent thing Trump seems to misunderstand about tariffs is that they are paid in the US by people in the US. A reasonable person might also remember that he tried them a few years ago in a trade war, to negative effect. We have, as a nation, shot ourselves in the dick. But don’t take my word for it! Here are some actual experts:
There are hints that these tariffs are the buffoonish products of actual clowns. Take the tariffs on uninhabited islands, perhaps part of a trade war on penguins. Or the tariffs on an island occupied primarily by… a US military base. Then there’s the math behind the tariffs, which uses a puzzling formula that is remarkably similar to what several chatbots spit back if asked. The official formulation uses fancy Greek letters that effectively cancel each other out. The Financial Times — a funnier European version of The Wall Street Journal — translated it into “the stupidest chart you’ll see today.”
The US has shaken the world’s confidence, and there are consequences for that
Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, doesn’t seem to know the answers to some basic tariff questions when he was asked about them, such as why Canada and Mexico were missing from Trump’s big nonsense tariff chart. Bessent also said he wasn’t part of the tariff negotiations with countries such as China, which is, frankly, weird. If the secretary of the treasury isn’t in the loop on tariff negotiations, uh, who is?
The best-case scenario for all this, which still sucks, is that these tariffs — set to roll out in stages on April 5th and April 9th — will be abandoned. Trump has been threatening devastating tariffs on Mexico, Canada, or Colombia for months, only to back down at the first sign of resistance. Even the generally docile members of Congress are exhibiting signs of noticing this is a bad idea, and are at least paying lip service to restraining Trump’s power. But this frankly bizarre US vs. Everyone trade war could still be devastating to the US economy for years to come, even if the nonsense tariffs aren’t enacted. The US has shaken the world’s confidence, and there are consequences for that.
Tariffs of any kind are disruptive. Since companies know they will be paying extra on items they import, they will pass the increase on to consumers, especially the poorest ones. They are likely to look for ways to cut costs and are unlikely to splash out on investments, says Meissner. Consumers are likely to do the same thing — cutting back on spending and holding onto necessities for longer than they would have otherwise, at least in part because they know there’s higher likelihood they’ll be fired if companies trim costs.
Wages will likely remain the same, even as everything costs more
The design of these new tariffs amplifies all of this. They’re global with a minimum tax of at least 10 percent, so companies can’t easily avoid them by moving supply chains around, like many did during Trump’s first trade war. And already we are seeing disruptions. The Nintendo Switch 2 has delayed preorders. Advertising businesses — like Meta, Google, and Amazon — are bracing for pullbacks on spending, especially from Chinese companies. Expect the price of groceries, clothes, and cars in particular to rise steeply. China has announced its retaliatory tariff, which will doubtless make those estimated price rises worse, and it may be the first of many countries to do so.
These increases differ from the inflation that happened in the wake of COVID, Wolfers says. During that time, increased prices meant more money for companies, which could then be used to pay their employees more. But — because again, tariffs are a tax — this money will go straight to the Trump Administration. So wages will likely remain the same, even as everything costs more.
Let’s talk for a hot minute about how the economy was doing pre-tariff. That dip in consumer confidence predated the latest tariff announcement. The actions of DOGE — firing and unfiring people, slashing social services, freezing previously-agreed-on grants, and generally running amok in the government — already shook consumers. In March, consumers’ expectations for the future were the lowest they’d been in more than a decade. In particular, people were nervous about their employment, which is the kind of thing that leads people to cut spending.
A great deal of economics is basically just feelings. People are feeling bad, and the tariffs have them feeling worse. That’s the kind of thing that can spiral into a recession. JP Morgan’s macro economist had previously put the risk of a recession at about 40 percent. That’s not the only bank to do so — S&P Global, Goldman, Barclay’s, Bank of America and Deutsche Bank all agree that the risk is now considerably higher, though they disagree about how much higher.
Those deals are “a way of making people beholden to you.”
“The economy will perform worse with tariffs,” says Wolfers. That doesn’t necessarily mean a recession — it could simply mean slower growth — but nonetheless some economists, including Meissner, are expecting one.
The ostensible reason behind these tariffs is to drive trade deficits to zero, but that makes no sense. A trade deficit essentially means that the US is receiving many goods and services from a country in exchange for pieces of paper, and they are receiving fewer goods and services (and thus giving us less paper), Wolfers says. Who cares? Economics isn’t a zero sum game. Many of our beautiful and brilliant Verge subscribers are in a trade deficit with The Verge, as they pay us $7 a month for our fine text products, and we buy zero dollars’ worth of things from them. 
Trump’s supposed ultimate goal is to bring manufacturing back to the US, but this isn’t going to happen either. That requires a less uncertain environment so companies will invest in building here, for one thing. It also requires a workforce — and it’s unclear why Americans would choose to work in manufacturing jobs as long as they have other options.
Pragmatically, there are two things that explain these idiotic taxes. The first is that the Trump Administration is run by fucking bozos whose main qualification for their job is that they are Donald Trump’s spineless yes-men. The second is that Trump himself is by temperament a gangster, and he’s looking for leverage over every country and business that deals with the US. For instance, domestic farmers have been trying, unsuccessfully thus far, to get exemptions to tariffs so they don’t get “economically drawn and quartered” buying more expensive equipment while selling less food abroad, as one farmer put it. Trump has indicated he’s open to making deals to lower tariffs on individual countries. 
Uncertainty around bribery and exemptions actually make this clown show worse
Those deals are “a way of making people beholden to you,” says Barrett. “I’m torn on whether this is just not well-thought out, or whether the uncertainty is part of the design.”
What might one have to do in order to get such an exemption? Well, Colombia, Canada and Mexico provide examples: make a silly concession that lets Trump declare victory while changing nothing of note. After all, Trump is addled by television to a degree that as long as something sounds good on Fox News, it’s a win for him.
As for individual industries, we already have indications in the form of tech moguls’ generous donations, generous production deals for Trump family hagiographies, killing DEI programs to make conservative ideologues happy, and massive pro bono law firm deals.
But that uncertainty around bribery and exemptions actually makes this clown show worse. The idea behind tariffs is that in the long term, it lets American companies more effectively compete by raising prices on foreign goods. That gives American-made goods a chance to raise their own prices as well, juicing profits. But for that to happen, companies have to invest in building things in America — and as previously mentioned, the uncertainty about how long any given tariffs may last is likely to lead to more of a wait-and-see approach. Which… kinda defeats the purpose.
“We have undercut the good faith and standing of the government in the world’s eyes.”
Markets don’t like uncertainty. Neither do trade partners. America is likely to be hit with reciprocal tariffs, including from our allies, increasing the country’s pain. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs, famous to anyone who’s read Dave Barry Slept Here, introduced in 1930, are widely credited with worsening the Great Depression. The Trump tariffs are even bigger than those disastrous ones, based on nonsensical math that, for instance, hits an average EU tariff rate of about 2.7 percent with a “reciprocal” rate of 20 percent.
The uncertainty also hurts the US politically. “We have undercut the good faith and standing of the government in the world’s eyes,” Barrett says. This undermines the dollar as a reserve currency for the world — one of its important functions for American political power, allowing us to borrow money more cheaply than most other countries. And indeed, the value of the dollar plummeted after the tariffs were announced — to a six-month low against the euro. The US’s bad behavior here is an incentive for people to move their money elsewhere.
This is like watching a trainwreck in slow motion. Previously, the Trump administration weakened the dollar by announcing its crypto reserve. Musk unilaterally decided to tank our ability to work as the world’s R&D hub, attracting global talent and boosting our economy — and, additionally, taking an ax to American soft power in the process. Congress, which has chosen to abdicate control over spending, is effectively sidelined. Now the tariffs further endanger American wealth and safety. The only real questions are when we’re going to get the explosion, and how big it’ll be.

41,2025-04-04,"Nike’s stock climbed 4.5% on Friday — even as the broader market plunged — after President Donald Trump said he’d held trade discussions with Vietnam, where the footwear giant does half of its production. Lululemon and Deckers shares also rebounded.
The shoemaker’s shares had plummeted 14% yesterday, wiping billions from its marked cap, after Trump announced 46% import taxes on goods from the Southeast Asian nation. Other garment and footwear makers also plunged.
“Vietnam wants to cut their Tariffs down to ZERO if they are able to make an agreement with the U.S.,” Trump said via a post on Truth Social, after a “very productive call” with Vietnamese leader To Lam. Trump added that he looks forward “to a meeting in the near future.” Earlier, Trump had said his trade policies “will never change.”
Barring a deal, tariffs will drive up the price of Nike sneakers and hamper sales, Morningstar analyst David Swartz told Fast Company.
 “It may not be so easy for Nike to sell Lebron shoes if they have to raise the price from $180 to $240,” he said. “They will sell less volume ultimately.”
Other apparel makers linked to Vietnam rallied on Friday — including Deckers, which gained 3.1%, On Holding, which jumped 6%, and Lululemon, which climbed 0.8% as of 12:53 p.m. 
Some homebuilders also rallied after Trump didn’t impose additional tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which will reduce the pressure on building materials prices. D.H. Horton stock gained 5.8%, NVR shares gained 5.6%, and Lennar stock advanced 3.6%.
Overall, it was another dire day for investors, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq Composite plunging 4%, 4.8%, and 4.9%, respectively, after China unveiled retaliatory tariffs. On Thursday, equities markets recorded their worst results in five years.
Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
"
42,2025-04-04,"This week, President Donald Trump’s new tariffs sent shockwaves through the stock market, triggering a sharp sell-off as investors reacted to escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 1,400 points, marking one of its steepest declines in years. As the Magnificent 7 tech stocks – Amazon (AMZN), Apple, and Tesla (TSLA) among them – slid, concerns about price increases and supply chain disruptions began to grow. 
In times like these, many investors look for guidance when the market turns volatile. 
Warren Buffet, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A), has some advice when  market declines occur: Stay calm and avoid panic. 
In his 2017 shareholder letter, Buffet stressed the importance of sticking to a long-term strategy, regardless of how volatile the market becomes. 
“When major declines occur ... that’s the time to heed these lines,” Buffet noted, pointing to Rudyard Kipling’s 19th century poem “If–.” 
“If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs . . . If you can wait and not be tired by waiting . . . If you can think – and not make thoughts your aim . . . If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you... Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it.”
Buffet  added that the market will always experience ups and down, and investing involves the risk that the expected objective won’t always be attained. 
“The light can go from green to red without pausing at yellow,” he said. Those who stay financially secure and patient during downturns are the ones who ultimately emerge stronger, he added. 
As Trump’s tariffs continue to rattle markets, create uncertainty, and spark volatility, Buffet’s advice is more relevant than ever. The legendary investor has previously likened the tariffs to “an act of war,” partly because “the Tooth Fairy doesn’t pay ‘em!”

43,2025-04-04,"Donald Trump is defending his tariff plan with poorly sourced hype videos. 
The president shared an X video, a copy of a TikTok post, to his Truth Social account Friday morning calling his economic plans “genius” without much substance. The video starts out by saying Trump is crashing the economy on purpose and that billionaire investor Warren Buffett is praising the president for making “the best economic moves he’s seen in 50 years.”
Trump is playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers. pic.twitter.com/fvThLx82Ev
This isn’t true at all, though. Last month, Buffett openly called Trump’s tariffs “a tax on goods” in an interview.
“Tariffs are actually, we’ve had a lot of experience with them. They’re an act of war, to some degree,” Buffett said. “I mean, the tooth fairy doesn’t pay ’em! And then what? You always have to ask that question in economics. You always say, ‘And then what?’” 
Trump’s video goes on to make several other unsourced claims, including that the Federal Reserve will be forced to slash interest rates in May, allowing trillions of dollars in debt to be refinanced inexpensively. The video also claims that the dollar will be weakened and that mortgage rates will drop, and repeats Trump’s claims that tariffs will compel businesses to build in the U.S. and force farmers to sell more crops stateside as well. There is no indication that any of this will happen. Indeed, Trump is practically begging—or maybe threatening—Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to slash rates. 
The video shows that Trump is deluded that his tariffs are going to succeed and is pushing any source that backs him up. The TikTok account that the video comes from lacks credibility, as it doesn’t even have a bio and seems to only post summary videos of news events without any indication of who is making them. Meanwhile, the stock market continues to plummet and Americans continue to worry about their jobs.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent may be planning to cut and run after Donald Trump’s disastrous “reciprocal tariff” announcement earlier this week. 
During an appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe Friday, contributor Stephanie Ruhle reported that the key Cabinet member is already looking for an escape hatch.
“My sources say that Scott Bessent is kind of the odd man out here and, in the inner circle that Trump has, he’s not even close to Scott Bessent or listening to him,” Ruhle said. “Some have said to me, he’s looking for an exit door to try to get himself to the Fed, because in the last few days he’s really hurting his own credibility and history in the markets.”
To be sure, Trump’s tariff policy represents a sort of defeat for Bessent, a former hedge fund manager who entered office under the delusion that he might actually succeed in stopping Trump from wrecking the economy. Should he flee the administration now, he would likely forfeit what little credibility remains. 
Bessent warned other countries Wednesday not to make any rash decisions in reaction to Trump’s sweeping “retaliatory tariff” policy, which included a 10 percent baseline tariff on almost every country in the world. 
“My advice to every country right now is: Do not retaliate. Sit back, take it in, let’s see how it goes. Because if you retaliate, there will be escalation. If you don’t retaliate, this is the high-water mark,” he warned. 
Bessent’s warning came off particularly clueless given that democratically elected foreign leaders are likely beholden to their electorate, who won’t take lightly to Trump’s blatant bullying. 
Ruhle’s sources told her Bessent must understand just how ridiculous Trump’s tariff policy is because he “actually understands how the markets work, and what’s happening right now is only going to hurt markets,” she said. 
And it already has: The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite experienced their single worst sessions since 2020 on Thursday. Bessent’s nomination had received strong Republican support because of his experience with financial markets. 
“And even for Scott Bessent to say a few weeks ago, you know, getting cheap goods fast is ‘not part of the American dream.’ No, it’s not part of the American dream, but it’s part of the way Americans live, especially people who are economically vulnerable,” Ruhle said. “They don’t have the option to say, ‘No, I’d like higher things that cost more.’ They need low-cost things because they don’t make that much money.”
Already, countries are ignoring Bessent’s weak warning. China announced Friday that it would impose a reciprocal 34 percent tariff on all imports from the U.S. Trump had levied two rounds of 10 percent duties on all Chinese imports, and then an additional 34 percent tariff on Wednesday. It’s easy to see how prices can quickly add up for working- and middle-class Americans who have relied on cheap products from countries like China. 
Before he was nominated to serve in the Trump administration, Bessent had defended the use of tariffs as a form of sanctions. He told Bloomberg in August that tariffs were a “one-time price adjustment” and were “not inflationary.”
“I think that tariffs in a way can be regarded as an economic sanction without a sanction. If you don’t like Chinese economic policy, flooding the market with over production, you could put a sanction on them, or a tariff,” Bessent said at the time. 
Donald Trump is looking for a scapegoat to redirect America’s tariff fury.
The president attempted to influence Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell ahead of the head banker’s remarks Friday, insisting that the chairman should cut interest rates.
“This would be a PERFECT time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut Interest Rates,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “He is always ‘late,’ but he could now change his image, and quickly.” 
Trump then claimed that energy prices, interest rates, inflation, and egg prices are down. (Energy prices, interest rates, and inflation are actually not down. Egg prices, however, are $3 a dozen again.) The president also claimed that jobs are “up,” likely referring to the jobs report he celebrated earlier Friday that assessed positive job growth in the U.S. economy before he implemented tariffs that cratered the stock market.
“A BIG WIN for America,” Trump wrote. “CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!”
Rate cuts, however, would not be an imminent and forthcoming solution to the market chaos, according to the chairman.
“We don’t need to be in a hurry,” Powell said later Friday. “We are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance. It is too soon to say what will be the appropriate path for monetary policy.”
Overall, Powell’s speech did not spell good news in the wake of Trump’s sweeping tariff plan. Powell described Trump’s tariffs as “significantly larger than expected” and predicted that the levies would contribute to—at minimum—a “temporary rise in inflation,” though he noted that the “effects could be more persistent.” 
The decision to cut interest rates or not was a major sticking point between Trump and Powell toward the end of Trump’s first term, when the Covid-19 pandemic sent the economy on a roller-coaster ride.
Economists have predicted that the tariffs could throw the U.S. into a recession. Trump’s plan has been interpreted around the globe as an economic attack, forcing the leaders of some of America’s longest-term allies to turn away from U.S. leadership.
“The global economy is fundamentally different today than it was yesterday. The system of global trade anchored on the United States … is over,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Thursday, as if delivering a eulogy for the two nations’ relationship, the day after Trump unveiled the plan.
“Our old relationship of steadily deepening integration with the United States is over,” Carney said. “The 80-year period when the United States embraced the mantle of global economic leadership, when it forged alliances rooted in trust and mutual respect, and championed the free and open exchange of goods and services, is over.”
A new poll has Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez handily beating Senator Chuck Schumer head-to-head in the 2028 New York primary. 
Fifty-five percent of likely Democratic voters preferred Ocasio-Cortez according to the survey, which was conducted by the liberal group Data for Progress, while 36 percent preferred Schumer. Nine percent went undecided.
This underscores the reputational damage Schumer has taken in the early days of Trump’s second term, particularly after he decided to advance a GOP spending bill without seeking concessions rather than shut down the government, completely capitulating to Elon Musk and Donald Trump’s extremist agenda. Schumer argued that shutting the government down was a worse look than giving Trump a blank check, but the Democratic base disagrees. 
“I think that’s absolutely wrong. Republicans control the House, they control the Senate, they control the Oval Office. They’d be voting against our measure to keep the government open,” Senator Jeff Merkley said at the time. “I think America would understand that this is a Republican shutdown, if there was a shutdown.… You don’t stop a bully by handing over your lunch money, and you don’t stop a tyrant by giving them more power.”
This poll also emphasizes the ideological struggle that rages on within the Democratic Party. While Schumer and other moderates cancel book tours and blame the party’s “woke” left, Ocasio-Cortez had been barnstorming towns with Bernie Sanders, railing against oligarchy and making the progressive case for the party’s future. 
Schumer’s approval rating among Democrats is currently 48 percent, the lowest it’s been since 2019. 
Senator Ted Cruz apparently has a limit on what he will tolerate from President Trump, and tariffs cross it. 
The Trump sycophant told Fox Business’s Larry Kudlow Thursday that he didn’t think the president’s insane tariffs were a good idea, calling them “a tax on consumers.” 
“I’m not a fan of jacking up taxes on American consumers,” Cruz said. “So my hope is these tariffs are short-lived and they serve as leverage to lower tariffs across the globe.
“Look, I think it is a mistake to assume that we will have high tariffs in perpetuity. I don’t think that would be good economic policy,” Cruz added. “I am not a fan of tariffs.” 
Cruz qualified his comments, saying that if the tariffs cause trading partners to “dramatically reduce the tariffs they charge on U.S. goods, and services, and the consequence of that is the U.S. government dramatically cuts the tariffs that were announced yesterday, that would be a great outcome.
 “But if the result is our trading partners jack up their tariffs and we have high tariffs everywhere, I think that is a bad outcome for America,” said the Texas senator. 
Cruz: Tariffs are a tax on consumers, and I'm not a fan of jacking up taxes on American consumers. pic.twitter.com/4H2A5kdHp7
Cruz’s mild criticism shows that even he sees the danger in blowing up the economy over a half-baked idea. Ever since his loss to Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, Cruz has almost slavishly supported the president, even after Trump called his wife ugly and linked Cruz’s father to the John F. Kennedy assassination. But the Texas senator knows that tariffs will hurt his constituents, who depend on trade with Mexico, living in a border state. The question is whether he and his fellow Republicans are prepared to take legislative action over it.
Republicans aren’t happy about Donald Trump’s tariffs tanking the stock market. 
In an appearance on Fox Business Friday, Senator Ron Johnson said he was worried about the direction the market was headed, after Trump’s announcement of sweeping “reciprocal tariffs” caused the Dow Jones Industrial Average to experience its biggest wipeout since 2020. 
“From my standpoint, I’m certainly concerned about what’s happening right now in the markets, and I hope the administration is looking at it as well,” Johnson said.
Johnson noted that while Trump was convinced that tariffs were the answer to the country’s economic woes, “what’s also indisputable is the markets are down about 8 percent in just two days.
“I’m getting all kinds of reactions from businesses, farmers in Wisconsin that are highly concerned about what’s happening. So, those are the facts; all I can really do is report the reality to the administration, let them know how these actions are impacting my constituents,” he said.
Johnson said Trump’s tariff policy was a “bold, risky move.” Meanwhile, analysts at JP Morgan have raised their recession forecasts for the next year from 40 percent to 60 percent.
Unfortunately for the Wisconsin Republican, Trump seemed completely unbothered by the major stock market tumble. 
“I think it’s going very well,” the president told reporters Thursday. “It was an operation like when a patient gets operated on, and it’s a big thing. I said this would be exactly the way it is.
“The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom, and the rest of the world wants to see, is there any way they can make a deal?” Trump added. 
While White House aides have insisted that the administration is not open to negotiating on tariff rates, Trump has begun signaling that he is willing to cut deals, according to CNBC. 
Trump’s new tariff policy is so unpopular in the Senate that it’s actually bringing together Democrats and Republicans. 
On Wednesday night, the Senate passed a rare bipartisan rebuke of Trump, with four Republican senators joining the Democrats to approve a resolution that would limit the president’s ability to impose tariffs on Canada. 
Senator Rand Paul appeared on Fox News Wednesday beside Democratic Senator Tim Kaine to criticize Trump’s tariffs, specifically the 25 percent tariff imposed on imports from Canada. 
“Trade is proportional to wealth. The last 70 years of international trade has been an exponential curve upward, and the last 70 years of prosperity has been upward also,” the Kentucky Republican said. “We are richer because of trade with Canada, and so is Canada.”
Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana told CNN’s Manu Raju Wednesday that he was concerned about Trump’s decision to play the long game. 
“In the long run, we’re all dead. Short run matters too,” Kennedy said. “Nobody knows what the impact of these tariffs is going to be on the economy.”
Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina warned that the economic pain threshold wasn’t the same for everyone. “Anyone who says there may be a little bit of pain before we get things right, needs to talk to my farmers who are one crop away from bankruptcy,” Tillis said. 
On Thursday, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley co-sponsored a bill with Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, that would allow Congress to review Trump’s tariffs. If passed, the Trade Review Act of 2025 would require Trump to give Congress 48 hours notice of tariffs he planned to impose and provide a 60-day window for Congress to approve the tariff or else have it scrapped. 
In a post on X Thursday, Grassley insisted that his support of the bill was not a response to Trump’s tariffs. “If u r trying to make the Trade Review Act about current events/Trump tariffs U R MISSING THE MARK I’ve long expressed my view that congress has delegated too much authority on trade to the executive branch under Republican & Democrat presidents,” he wrote.
Donald Trump will be fine dining Friday, instead of attending a ceremony for four fallen U.S. soldiers.
The commander in chief chose to attend the LIV Golf dinner reception in Florida Thursday night, financed by the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia, flying over Delaware’s Dover Air Force base where four service members who died on training grounds in a Lithuanian swamp were being honored.
Those soldiers include 25-year-old Sergeant Jose Duenez Jr. of Joliet, Illinois; 25-year-old Sergeant Edvin F. Franco of Glendale, California; 21-year-old Private First Class Dante D. Taitano of Dededo, Guam; and 28-year-old Staff Sergeant Troy S. Knutson-Collins of Battle Creek, Michigan.
The M88 Hercules armored recovery vehicle the team had been using was discovered 16 feet underground, a day after the soldiers went missing, but the massive machinery took days to unearth in its entirety. The last soldier’s body was recovered Tuesday, capping a weeklong search by hundreds of personnel in the U.S. military and Lithuania’s emergency services.
The soldiers were honored during a dignified departure ceremony in Lithuania attended by Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda. Trump’s decision to not attend the arrival ceremony suggests that the U.S. military leader cares less about America’s armed forces than the leaders of foreign countries.
Meanwhile, this very important dinner kicks off a three-day LIV Golf tournament hosted at Trump National Doral Golf Club.
Trump has had a bad history with honoring the Army’s dead. In 2020, HuffPost reported that Trump stopped attending dignified transfers after the father of slain Navy SEAL William “Ryan” Owens refused to meet or shake Trump’s hand. Owens died during a controversial raid on Yemen that Trump greenlit just one week into his first term.
“I told them I don’t want to meet the president,” Bill Owens told the Miami Herald at the time. Owens would go on to accuse Trump of trying to “hide behind my son’s death” in order to avoid an investigation into the incident.
But it’s possible that the deceased servicemen don’t matter at all to Trump. Last week, the president was caught completely in the dark more than 24 hours after the soldiers first went missing.
At an Oval Office news briefing, Trump casually admitted that he was not aware that the U.S. army members had disappeared during a training exercise in Lithuania.
“Have you been briefed about the soldiers in Lithuania who are missing?” a reporter asked.
“No, I haven’t,” Trump said, failing to offer the soldiers or their families any well wishes.
Trump is slated to visit Saudi Arabia in the coming weeks, marking his first trip abroad since reentering the White House, reported The Wall Street Journal. Saudi Arabia is currently the center of peace talks between Ukraine and Russia.
The Trump administration is attempting to use the positive jobs report from March to assuage widespread economic panic over the unprecedented trade war the president launched on Wednesday. 
“Today’s jobs report shows the private sector is roaring back under President Donald J. Trump—smashing expectations for the second straight month as the Golden Age of America is well on its way,” the White House announced in a press release emailed to reporters with the subject line “JOBS, JOBS, JOBS.” “In March, the U.S. added 228,000 jobs—nearly 100,000 more jobs than economists predicted and the fourth-highest month for private payroll growth in the past two years.… The report highlights a resilient labor market as companies aggressively onshore jobs amid President Trump’s bold trade and economic agenda.” 
The administration’s rhetoric is the living embodiment of the “This is fine” burning-house meme. It’s baffling to watch it try to fool Americans with this faux excitement over a jobs report as the stock market craters, panic grows, and tariff-related layoffs begin. How can manufacturers hire more, how can consumers continue to spend and invest when everything across the board becomes more expensive? 
“GREAT JOBS NUMBERS, FAR BETTER THAN EXPECTED. IT’S ALREADY WORKING,” the president wrote on X, referring to his massive tariffs on virtually every U.S. trading parter. “HANK TOUGH, WE CAN’T LOSE.” (Trump later changed his misspell from ‘Hank” to “Hang.”)
“GREAT NEWS! The economy is starting to roar with a strong 228,000 jobs added in the month of March—well ahead of the market’s expectation,” wrote press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “There was also a sharp increase in transportation, construction, and warehousing employment. The President’s push to onshore jobs here in the United States is working. The Golden Age of America is on its way!”
These are insane messages to broadcast to the country as fears of stagflation set in. Even Trump’s cheerleaders at Fox Business weren’t buying the fake joy over last month’s jobs numbers.
“These numbers aren’t gonna make any difference at all,” one host said plainly. “What the market is worried about is what’s gonna happen in the future. Who’s gonna hire now in this uncertain environment? I think people are very very concerned, and that’s why … we need to get to work, we need to act on negotiating now, we need to get tax cuts now, we need to get deregulation now before this gets out of control the other way.” 
“We want as quick a deal on these tariffs as soon as possible because every country would benefit,” another host chimed in. But Trump himself has made it crystal clear that there will be no deal—or, for that matter, negotiations. These tariffs are final, and help is not on the way.
Analysts at the world’s largest bank say that a recession is more likely to happen than not. 
Analysts at JP Morgan, the marketing side of JP Morgan Chase & Co., adjusted their prediction Thursday that the United States would experience a recession in the next year, raising their forecasts to a whopping 60 percent from an already troubling 40 percent, according to The Wall Street Journal.
This decision comes after Donald Trump announced sweeping 10 percent tariffs on imports from nearly every country in the world, with additional country-specific tariffs levied on top. 
Analysts predicted that retaliatory tariffs could lead to huge disruptions in the supply chain and that the tariff rate, which they expect to increase by 20 percentage points, would be equivalent to the biggest tax hike since 1968, which also led to a recession, according to Reuters.
Trump’s announcement continued to send the stock market tumbling Thursday, amid concerns over a global trade war. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1,679.39 points, marking its worst session since June 2020, while the Nasdaq Composite saw its steepest drop since March 2020.
When Trump was asked about the crashing markets Thursday, he responded, “I think it’s going very well.” Blatant denial seems to be the name of the game, messaging-wise, as the White House insisted that it was not watching the market. 
Trump also enacted a “permanent” 25 percent tariff on all imported vehicles and autoparts—which is already kneecapping the U.S. auto industry. The president has already levied steep 25 percent tariffs on America’s closest trading partners, Mexico and Canada. 
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Thursday that the era of U.S. global leadership on trade was “over,” and said his country would begin looking elsewhere for trade partnerships. 
Rümeysa Öztürk, the Tufts University student brazenly abducted by masked immigration agents on a public street in Massachusetts, is suffering serious health issues in Homeland Security custody. 
Representative Ayanna Pressley, whose district includes the university, posted on Bluesky Thursday night that Öztürk has had three separate asthma attacks in custody while being denied access to her required medications, “a violation of her fundamental right to medical care.” 
“This is cruelty, it is neglect, and it is a damning moral and legal failure,” Pressley’s post said.
🚨UPDATE: Rümeysa Öztürk has now suffered three separate asthma attacks while in DHS custody.

She has not received her required asthma medications—a violation of her fundamental right to medical care.

This is cruelty, it is neglect, and it is a damning moral and legal failure.[image or embed]
Öztürk, a doctoral student on Fulbright scholarship, was allegedly detained for engaging “in activities in support of Hamas,” a DHS spokesperson said last week without offering any evidence supporting that charge. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also refused to offer any explanation of why Öztürk was detained without a court order or access to legal counsel, attacking the student for coming “into the U.S. as a visitor” and creating “a ruckus for us.” 
Rubio claims to have revoked the visas of “more than 300” international students so far, with no word on whether the State Department, DHS, or Immigration and Customs Enforcement is following due process. Tufts University has offered its support to Öztürk, making a declaration before the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts seeking “relief so that Ms Öztürk is released without delay so that she can return to complete her studies and finish her degree.” 
Meanwhile, Öztürk continues to be held in an ICE facility in Louisiana without access to her medication as her attorneys seek to have her transferred back to Massachusetts. True relief, however, will only come if she is granted due process, released from custody, and given the chance to address the allegations against her, if they even have any merit. "

President Trump's announcement of tariffs and retaliatory measures by China has seen Apple's shares drop to their lowest point since June 2024, as investors predict rising iPhone prices and falling sales. The sweeping tariffs introduced by Trump will affect every single one of the very many countries Apple relies on for its manufacturing.

And, those same advisors came up with the faulty formula that the president applied, that has nothing to do with tariffs applied by countries importing US goods. According to CNN, the 54% tariff that China has responded to, was made by dividing a given country's trade deficit by its exports to the US.

    The Switch 2 launch is still happening on June 5, and preorders outside the US seem unchanged.
  
Nintendo Switch 2 preorders in the US were to start April 9, but it appears those plans have changed due to the new tariffs imposed this week by President Donald Trump. It's unclear if this means Nintendo will also have to increase the price of the Switch successor, which currently starts at $450. 
Nintendo said Friday that it's delaying Switch 2 preorders in the US, but its June release date is unaffected. 
""Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,"" the company said in a statement. ""Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.""
Nintendo didn't indicate if preorder dates outside the US would change, but Eurogamer reports that preorders are live at various retailers in the UK.
GameStop, one of the largest video game retailers, posted on X (formerly Twitter) echoing Nintendo's statement and asserting it will keep working with the company to update customers when more information about pre-order dates becomes available, also advising them to sign up on GameStop's site for updates.
An update from Nintendo pic.twitter.com/iygReQlBwl
A tariff of 24% has been applied by the US to goods from Japan. Were that rate to be applied directly to the Switch 2's announced price, it would rise to $558, but it would be up to Nintendo how much of the tariff it will pass on to consumers.
This is a developing story."
46,2025-04-04,"The Dow Jones plunged more than 2,000 points, or 5.1 percent, Friday as investors reacted to China’s retaliatory tariffs. The drop-off followed a 1,679-point decline the day before.
Beijing’s Commerce Ministry announced it would impose a 34 percent tariff on imports of all U.S. products as soon as April 10, matching the 34 percent tariff that Donald Trump announced he would impose on Chinese imports as part of his “Liberation Day” tariff strategy. 
Despite publicly celebrating the enforcement of his plan, the U.S. president’s nonsensical economic strategy has tanked markets in just two days.
Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” the CBOE S&P 500 Volatility Index (VIX), jumped to 44.4 by Friday afternoon—a 22.8-point jump since Wednesday, and a 26.5-point jump since the beginning of the year, according to data compiled by The Wall Street Journal, putting the economy on track for a bear market.
In a note to investors, JP Morgan said that Trump’s tariffs had a 40 percent chance of slingshotting the U.S. economy into a recession. JP Morgan underscored that the tariffs would cause a price surge—adding two percent to the Consumer Price Index—and additionally raise taxes on Americans by $660 billion a year, “the largest tax increase in recent memory by a longshot,” CNN reported Thursday.
“The impact on inflation will be substantial,” the analysts said, according to the network. “We view the full implementation of these policies as a substantial macroeconomic shock.”
Beyond the economic devastation, Trump’s tariffs have also landed the U.S. in legal hot water. China also announced Friday it would be suing the U.S. via the World Trade Organization, arguing that Trump’s tariff plan “seriously undermines” global trade.
“The United States’ imposition of so-called ‘reciprocal tariffs’ seriously violates WTO rules, seriously damages the legitimate rights and interests of WTO members, and seriously undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system and international economic and trade order,” the Commerce Ministry said. “It is a typical unilateral bullying practice that endangers the stability of the global economic and trade order. China firmly opposes this.”
The Trump administration is also facing lawsuits over the sweeping tariff plan at home.
The New Civil Liberties Alliance sued the president Thursday, claiming that Trump’s decision to invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to enforce the tariffs—which impacts trade with some 200 countries—did not give him the power to “usurp” Congress’s right to control tariffs or “upset the Constitution’s separation of powers.”
In a press release, the right-wing group (which has financial ties to Leonard Leo and the Koch network) argued that the emergency statute “authorizes specific emergency actions like imposing sanctions or freezing assets to protect the United States from foreign threats.” 
“It does not authorize the President to impose tariffs,” the NCLA wrote.
President Donald Trump has once again swooped in to save TikTok, after the president’s sweeping tariffs undermined a deal with China. 
“My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress,” Trump wrote on Truth Social Friday. 
The president said that he planned to sign an executive order to delay the enforcement of the U.S. TikTok ban for an additional 75 days. 
Trump continued to say that U.S. officials hoped to continue negotiations with China, “who I understand are not very happy about our Reciprocal Tariffs.”
“This proves that Tariffs are the most powerful Economic tool, and very important to our National Security! We do not want TikTok to ‘go dark.’ We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal. Thank you for your attention to this matter,” Trump wrote. 
Trump appeared to suggest that his “reciprocal tariff” policy, which placed a baseline 10 percent tariff on nearly every country in the world, was some kind of chip in negotiations over TikTok’s parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance. In 2024, Congress passed a law that required the firm to sell TikTok’s U.S. operations to a non-Chinese owner, or see it banned in the U.S. Trump has now swooped in twice to rescue the app from going dark (after putting it on Congress’s radar in the first place).
In reality, Trump’s decision to impose steep tariffs on China has only gotten in the way of negotiations. The White House had nearly reached an agreement with China on TikTok, but the country hit the breaks after Trump’s tariff announcement Wednesday, the Associated Press reported. 
After Trump imposed a 34 percent tariff on Chinese imports to the U.S. earlier this week, in addition to two previous rounds of 10 percent duties, China responded in kind, levying its own 34 percent tariff on all imports from the U.S. on Friday. 
In 2024, the U.S. imported $438.9 billion worth of Chinese goods, and China imported $143.5 worth of American goods, according to the U.S. trade representative. 
Trump previously signed an executive order in January to keep the app running for U.S. users for 75 days, “to permit my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course of action with respect to TikTok.” The grace period was set to expire Saturday, April 5.

Then they came for the gamers: Nintendo is delaying preorders of the Switch 2 in the wake of Trump’s sweeping, unprecedented tariffs on the entire world. Experts, meanwhile, think the device’s high cost is a direct result of the company anticipating the devastating effect of tariffs.
“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date,” Nintendo said in a statement from IGN. “The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”
The Switch is manufactured in China and Vietnam, countries that Trump placed 34 percent and 46 percent tariffs on, respectively. The Switch 2 is perhaps the most anticipated gaming console release of the year, as the first iteration was the third-bestselling gaming console of all time. 
Trump’s tariffs have gamers everywhere bracing for aggressive price increases. “There’s no doubt that Nintendo and Sony bumped prices higher initially to pre-empt potential tariffs,” Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad wrote on X. “They are indeed higher than expected, but I wouldn’t expect the % price increase to be exactly in-line with the tariff.
“When [graphics processing unit] prices increased in February that’s because tariffs on China were 10%. When they increased again in March that’s because they were 20%,” he continued. “Now they’re 54% for China and other Asia markets incl. Vietnam are 46%. Unless reversed, expect all gaming hardware to see jumps.”
Others speculated that Nintendo waited until the very last minute to decide on a price increase due to the intense uncertainty surrounding the tariffs. 
“Nintendo appears to be building in a buffer against these potential trade barriers while ensuring they maintain their traditional positive margin on hardware,” NYU professor Joost van Dreunen told IGN. “My view is that they probably had a range of pricing for the U.S. market in play up until the last minute due to the uncertainty on import tariffs.”
This reinforces the very basic economic concept of tariffs being a tax on the consumer more than anything else. And when used as wantonly and spitefully as Trump is using them, the price of everything, everywhere, shoots up.
A fifth of the jobs slashed at the Department of Health and Human Services were actually a mistake, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said.
Under the direction of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, the health agency fired some 10,000 employees this week in an ongoing government reduction effort that Kennedy has said could downsize his department’s 82,000-employee workforce by as much as a quarter.
But by Kennedy’s own admission, that process is apparently so haphazard, rushed, and inefficient that it basically has to involve major mistakes that undermine the department’s work.
“Personnel that should not have been cut, were cut,” Kennedy told reporters on Thursday. “We’re reinstating them. And that was always the plan. Part of the DOGE, we talked about this from the beginning, is we’re going to do 80 percent cuts, but 20 percent of those are going to have to be reinstated, because we’ll make mistakes.”
Kennedy noted that some of the employees affected were not in administrative roles, as DOGE had promised, and that the layoff had affected the agency’s research work. One such program included a team of researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that monitors lead exposure in children.
“There were some programs that were cut that are being reinstated, and I believe that that’s one,” Kennedy said.
Other shuttered departments were responsible for research and policy recommendations on older adults, disabilities, HIV, minority health, mine safety, and smoking. It is unclear if these are among the research priorities that will return.
The negligent error is just one recent instance in which the “shock and awe” of the Trump administration’s federal makeover has resulted in dud details and mass confusion.
Since January, the Trump administration has fired more than 100,000 federal employees, killing the Education Department and attacking the Environmental Protection Agency. Mass layoffs were also conducted at the Department of Energy in February, where DOGE similarly and mistakenly nixed critical workers focused on nuclear safety.
Bringing those employees back wasn’t as easy as simply having them return to work the next day. Instead, dejected and “shell shocked” employees at the semiautonomous National Nuclear Security Administration were reportedly considering early retirement or looking for work in more stable sectors, unsure if or when the Trump administration might try to dismiss them again, according to The Bulwark.
But tens of thousands more government jobs are expected to be on the chopping block as Trump pursues a second round of “voluntary” buyouts in the coming weeks.
The former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Robert Califf, condemned the Health Department layoffs in a statement on LinkedIn.
“The FDA as we’ve known it is finished, with most of the leaders with institutional knowledge and a deep understanding of product development and safety no longer employed,” Califf wrote, describing the action as “a dark day for public health.”
Donald Trump is defending his tariff plan with poorly sourced hype videos. 
The president shared an X video, a copy of a TikTok post, to his Truth Social account Friday morning calling his economic plans “genius” without much substance. The video starts out by saying Trump is crashing the economy on purpose and that billionaire investor Warren Buffett is praising the president for making “the best economic moves he’s seen in 50 years.”
Trump is playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers. pic.twitter.com/fvThLx82Ev
This isn’t true at all, though. Last month, Buffett openly called Trump’s tariffs “a tax on goods” in an interview.
“Tariffs are actually, we’ve had a lot of experience with them. They’re an act of war, to some degree,” Buffett said. “I mean, the tooth fairy doesn’t pay ’em! And then what? You always have to ask that question in economics. You always say, ‘And then what?’” 
Trump’s video goes on to make several other unsourced claims, including that the Federal Reserve will be forced to slash interest rates in May, allowing trillions of dollars in debt to be refinanced inexpensively. The video also claims that the dollar will be weakened and that mortgage rates will drop, and repeats Trump’s claims that tariffs will compel businesses to build in the U.S. and force farmers to sell more crops stateside as well. There is no indication that any of this will happen. Indeed, Trump is practically begging—or maybe threatening—Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to slash rates. 
The video shows that Trump is deluded that his tariffs are going to succeed and is pushing any source that backs him up. The TikTok account that the video comes from lacks credibility, as it doesn’t even have a bio and seems to only post summary videos of news events without any indication of who is making them. Meanwhile, the stock market continues to plummet and Americans continue to worry about their jobs.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent may be planning to cut and run after Donald Trump’s disastrous “reciprocal tariff” announcement earlier this week. 
During an appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe Friday, contributor Stephanie Ruhle reported that the key Cabinet member is already looking for an escape hatch.
“My sources say that Scott Bessent is kind of the odd man out here and, in the inner circle that Trump has, he’s not even close to Scott Bessent or listening to him,” Ruhle said. “Some have said to me, he’s looking for an exit door to try to get himself to the Fed, because in the last few days he’s really hurting his own credibility and history in the markets.”
To be sure, Trump’s tariff policy represents a sort of defeat for Bessent, a former hedge fund manager who entered office under the delusion that he might actually succeed in stopping Trump from wrecking the economy. Should he flee the administration now, he would likely forfeit what little credibility remains. 
Bessent warned other countries Wednesday not to make any rash decisions in reaction to Trump’s sweeping “retaliatory tariff” policy, which included a 10 percent baseline tariff on almost every country in the world. 
“My advice to every country right now is: Do not retaliate. Sit back, take it in, let’s see how it goes. Because if you retaliate, there will be escalation. If you don’t retaliate, this is the high-water mark,” he warned. 
Bessent’s warning came off particularly clueless given that democratically elected foreign leaders are likely beholden to their electorate, who won’t take lightly to Trump’s blatant bullying. 
Ruhle’s sources told her Bessent must understand just how ridiculous Trump’s tariff policy is because he “actually understands how the markets work, and what’s happening right now is only going to hurt markets,” she said. 
And it already has: The Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite experienced their single worst sessions since 2020 on Thursday. Bessent’s nomination had received strong Republican support because of his experience with financial markets. 
“And even for Scott Bessent to say a few weeks ago, you know, getting cheap goods fast is ‘not part of the American dream.’ No, it’s not part of the American dream, but it’s part of the way Americans live, especially people who are economically vulnerable,” Ruhle said. “They don’t have the option to say, ‘No, I’d like higher things that cost more.’ They need low-cost things because they don’t make that much money.”
Already, countries are ignoring Bessent’s weak warning. China announced Friday that it would impose a reciprocal 34 percent tariff on all imports from the U.S. Trump had levied two rounds of 10 percent duties on all Chinese imports, and then an additional 34 percent tariff on Wednesday. It’s easy to see how prices can quickly add up for working- and middle-class Americans who have relied on cheap products from countries like China. 
Before he was nominated to serve in the Trump administration, Bessent had defended the use of tariffs as a form of sanctions. He told Bloomberg in August that tariffs were a “one-time price adjustment” and were “not inflationary.”
“I think that tariffs in a way can be regarded as an economic sanction without a sanction. If you don’t like Chinese economic policy, flooding the market with over production, you could put a sanction on them, or a tariff,” Bessent said at the time. 
Donald Trump is looking for a scapegoat to redirect America’s tariff fury.
The president attempted to influence Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell ahead of the head banker’s remarks Friday, insisting that the chairman should cut interest rates.
“This would be a PERFECT time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut Interest Rates,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “He is always ‘late,’ but he could now change his image, and quickly.” 
Trump then claimed that energy prices, interest rates, inflation, and egg prices are down. (Energy prices, interest rates, and inflation are actually not down. Egg prices, however, are $3 a dozen again.) The president also claimed that jobs are “up,” likely referring to the jobs report he celebrated earlier Friday that assessed positive job growth in the U.S. economy before he implemented tariffs that cratered the stock market.
“A BIG WIN for America,” Trump wrote. “CUT INTEREST RATES, JEROME, AND STOP PLAYING POLITICS!”
Rate cuts, however, would not be an imminent and forthcoming solution to the market chaos, according to the chairman.
“We don’t need to be in a hurry,” Powell said later Friday. “We are well positioned to wait for greater clarity before considering any adjustments to our policy stance. It is too soon to say what will be the appropriate path for monetary policy.”
Overall, Powell’s speech did not spell good news in the wake of Trump’s sweeping tariff plan. Powell described Trump’s tariffs as “significantly larger than expected” and predicted that the levies would contribute to—at minimum—a “temporary rise in inflation,” though he noted that the “effects could be more persistent.” 
The decision to cut interest rates or not was a major sticking point between Trump and Powell toward the end of Trump’s first term, when the Covid-19 pandemic sent the economy on a roller-coaster ride.
Economists have predicted that the tariffs could throw the U.S. into a recession. Trump’s plan has been interpreted around the globe as an economic attack, forcing the leaders of some of America’s longest-term allies to turn away from U.S. leadership.
“The global economy is fundamentally different today than it was yesterday. The system of global trade anchored on the United States … is over,” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Thursday, as if delivering a eulogy for the two nations’ relationship, the day after Trump unveiled the plan.
“Our old relationship of steadily deepening integration with the United States is over,” Carney said. “The 80-year period when the United States embraced the mantle of global economic leadership, when it forged alliances rooted in trust and mutual respect, and championed the free and open exchange of goods and services, is over.”
A new poll has Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez handily beating Senator Chuck Schumer head-to-head in the 2028 New York primary. 
Fifty-five percent of likely Democratic voters preferred Ocasio-Cortez according to the survey, which was conducted by the liberal group Data for Progress, while 36 percent preferred Schumer. Nine percent went undecided.
This underscores the reputational damage Schumer has taken in the early days of Trump’s second term, particularly after he decided to advance a GOP spending bill without seeking concessions rather than shut down the government, completely capitulating to Elon Musk and Donald Trump’s extremist agenda. Schumer argued that shutting the government down was a worse look than giving Trump a blank check, but the Democratic base disagrees. 
“I think that’s absolutely wrong. Republicans control the House, they control the Senate, they control the Oval Office. They’d be voting against our measure to keep the government open,” Senator Jeff Merkley said at the time. “I think America would understand that this is a Republican shutdown, if there was a shutdown.… You don’t stop a bully by handing over your lunch money, and you don’t stop a tyrant by giving them more power.”
This poll also emphasizes the ideological struggle that rages on within the Democratic Party. While Schumer and other moderates cancel book tours and blame the party’s “woke” left, Ocasio-Cortez had been barnstorming towns with Bernie Sanders, railing against oligarchy and making the progressive case for the party’s future. 
Schumer’s approval rating among Democrats is currently 48 percent, the lowest it’s been since 2019. 
Senator Ted Cruz apparently has a limit on what he will tolerate from President Trump, and tariffs cross it. 
The Trump sycophant told Fox Business’s Larry Kudlow Thursday that he didn’t think the president’s insane tariffs were a good idea, calling them “a tax on consumers.” 
“I’m not a fan of jacking up taxes on American consumers,” Cruz said. “So my hope is these tariffs are short-lived and they serve as leverage to lower tariffs across the globe.
“Look, I think it is a mistake to assume that we will have high tariffs in perpetuity. I don’t think that would be good economic policy,” Cruz added. “I am not a fan of tariffs.” 
Cruz qualified his comments, saying that if the tariffs cause trading partners to “dramatically reduce the tariffs they charge on U.S. goods, and services, and the consequence of that is the U.S. government dramatically cuts the tariffs that were announced yesterday, that would be a great outcome.
 “But if the result is our trading partners jack up their tariffs and we have high tariffs everywhere, I think that is a bad outcome for America,” said the Texas senator. 
Cruz: Tariffs are a tax on consumers, and I'm not a fan of jacking up taxes on American consumers. pic.twitter.com/4H2A5kdHp7
Cruz’s mild criticism shows that even he sees the danger in blowing up the economy over a half-baked idea. Ever since his loss to Trump in the 2016 Republican presidential primary, Cruz has almost slavishly supported the president, even after Trump called his wife ugly and linked Cruz’s father to the John F. Kennedy assassination. But the Texas senator knows that tariffs will hurt his constituents, who depend on trade with Mexico, living in a border state. The question is whether he and his fellow Republicans are prepared to take legislative action over it.
Republicans aren’t happy about Donald Trump’s tariffs tanking the stock market. 
In an appearance on Fox Business Friday, Senator Ron Johnson said he was worried about the direction the market was headed, after Trump’s announcement of sweeping “reciprocal tariffs” caused the Dow Jones Industrial Average to experience its biggest wipeout since 2020. 
“From my standpoint, I’m certainly concerned about what’s happening right now in the markets, and I hope the administration is looking at it as well,” Johnson said.
Johnson noted that while Trump was convinced that tariffs were the answer to the country’s economic woes, “what’s also indisputable is the markets are down about 8 percent in just two days.
“I’m getting all kinds of reactions from businesses, farmers in Wisconsin that are highly concerned about what’s happening. So, those are the facts; all I can really do is report the reality to the administration, let them know how these actions are impacting my constituents,” he said.
Johnson said Trump’s tariff policy was a “bold, risky move.” Meanwhile, analysts at JP Morgan have raised their recession forecasts for the next year from 40 percent to 60 percent.
Unfortunately for the Wisconsin Republican, Trump seemed completely unbothered by the major stock market tumble. 
“I think it’s going very well,” the president told reporters Thursday. “It was an operation like when a patient gets operated on, and it’s a big thing. I said this would be exactly the way it is.
“The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom, the country is going to boom, and the rest of the world wants to see, is there any way they can make a deal?” Trump added. 
While White House aides have insisted that the administration is not open to negotiating on tariff rates, Trump has begun signaling that he is willing to cut deals, according to CNBC. 
Trump’s new tariff policy is so unpopular in the Senate that it’s actually bringing together Democrats and Republicans. 
On Wednesday night, the Senate passed a rare bipartisan rebuke of Trump, with four Republican senators joining the Democrats to approve a resolution that would limit the president’s ability to impose tariffs on Canada. 
Senator Rand Paul appeared on Fox News Wednesday beside Democratic Senator Tim Kaine to criticize Trump’s tariffs, specifically the 25 percent tariff imposed on imports from Canada. 
“Trade is proportional to wealth. The last 70 years of international trade has been an exponential curve upward, and the last 70 years of prosperity has been upward also,” the Kentucky Republican said. “We are richer because of trade with Canada, and so is Canada.”
Republican Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana told CNN’s Manu Raju Wednesday that he was concerned about Trump’s decision to play the long game. 
“In the long run, we’re all dead. Short run matters too,” Kennedy said. “Nobody knows what the impact of these tariffs is going to be on the economy.”
Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina warned that the economic pain threshold wasn’t the same for everyone. “Anyone who says there may be a little bit of pain before we get things right, needs to talk to my farmers who are one crop away from bankruptcy,” Tillis said. 
On Thursday, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley co-sponsored a bill with Senator Maria Cantwell, a Democrat, that would allow Congress to review Trump’s tariffs. If passed, the Trade Review Act of 2025 would require Trump to give Congress 48 hours notice of tariffs he planned to impose and provide a 60-day window for Congress to approve the tariff or else have it scrapped. 
In a post on X Thursday, Grassley insisted that his support of the bill was not a response to Trump’s tariffs. “If u r trying to make the Trade Review Act about current events/Trump tariffs U R MISSING THE MARK I’ve long expressed my view that congress has delegated too much authority on trade to the executive branch under Republican & Democrat presidents,” he wrote."

    From cars to cameras, CNET experts weigh in on what you should consider buying now before tariffs increase prices.
  
""It's not a good time to be a consumer,"" a Stanford economist tells CNET.
US President Donald Trump's steep new import duties will drive up prices for most major tech products in the coming year, according to economists. But whether that will change the timing of your next tech purchase depends on what kind of tech you need.
We asked CNET's experts for their thoughts on what devices and products you should look at buying now, and what you can wait on, covering everything from phones, earbuds and laptops to gaming consoles, smart thermostats, electric vehicles and cameras.
Many of these products are either imported in their entirety or contain components that are not made in the US, like graphics processing units for PCs. Importing all those separate components will lead to higher costs under Trump's barrage of tariffs.

The tariffs will have an effect on a sweeping range of consumer expenditures, well beyond just tech products. Your groceries will likely see bumps in the prices of bananas, coffee and seafood, among other things. Much of the clothing, footwear and furniture we buy is made overseas. It's an indication of how the modern economy is built on a global scale with often complicated lines of interdependence. The Trump administration is hoping that the tariffs will lead to more manufacturing on American soil.
If you're not ready to make a purchase now, don't let yourself be rushed. Especially for products priced in the thousands of dollars -- you should always make sure that a purchase is a good fit for your budget. It's also unknown at the moment how long the tariffs might be in effect.
During the first Trump administration, tariffs pushed up the prices on washing machines, and prices of dryers followed suit, even though the tariffs weren't directly affecting those appliances.
""The tariffs are sweeping, and the effects are going to be even broader,"" says Neale Mahoney, director of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research and professor of economics at Stanford University. ""It's not a good time to be a consumer.""
Read more: How Much Will iPhone and Other Apple Prices Increase With 'Liberation Day' Tariffs?
Even goods that aren't directly impacted by the new tariffs could increase in price, according to Mahoney. During the first Trump administration, tariffs increased prices on washing machines, not dryers, but dryer prices increased as well. And during the COVID-19 pandemic, used car prices increased along with new car prices.
""There's going to be some uncertainty as we move to what economists call a new equilibrium,"" he says.

Even the lower-end iPhone 16E could see a price hike.
While Trump's tariffs are aimed at increasing US-based manufacturing and boosting sales of products already made here, CNET's managing editor for the mobile team, Patrick Holland, points out that there isn't a mainstream phone that's completely made in the US.
""Components come from all around the world,"" Holland says. ""That's true for Apple, Samsung or Xiaomi. So Apple being based in the US is at a similar disadvantage from tariffs as Samsung is being based in South Korea.""
Holland is optimistic that Apple will find a way to offset or absorb some of the increased importation costs in the short term. Nearly all iPhones are made in China, with the rest also made overseas. 
Read more: Mortgage Rate Predictions: Will Tariffs Impact Spring Homebuying?
Holland's advice is to hold onto your current phone for as long as you can, rather than running out to buy one in the hopes of beating a possible price hike.
Other experts are also warning against panic buying an iPhone, despite predicting that Apple's prices could rise by around 10% in coming months. ""[Tariffs] could lead to price increases of $50 to $150 on higher-end products like the iPhone Pro Max models and MacBook Pros,"" Stephan Shipe, a certified financial planner and CEO of Scholar Financial Advising, told CNET earlier this week.
Wall Street analysts from Rosenblatt Securities, according to Reuters, anticipate that if the 43% tariff on China is passed to consumers, the cost of an iPhone 16 could rise from $799 to $1,142; the iPhone 16 Pro Max could increase from $1,599 to $2,300; and even the newly launched low-end iPhone 16e could increase in pricing from $599 to $856.
And prices could be driven even higher after China on Friday retaliated by placing export restrictions on rare earth elements used in producing phones, EVs and other electronics.
If tariffs and general inflation are affecting your ability to pay for a brand new, high-end phone, Holland's best budget pick for those looking for a deal on a phone is the $500 Google Pixel 8A. ""It has one of the best values of any phone sold today,"" he says. ""But I look forward to testing the recently announced Pixel 9A that goes on sale Thursday, April 10.""
Smartwatches may not be affected by the tariffs this year, according to Vanessa Hand Orellana, CNET lead writer for smartwatches and wearable technology. ""I'm not sure if it will hit this year's smartwatch production cycle despite reports,"" she says. ""At this point in production, it's likely that all the manufacturing pieces for the 2025 watch models have already been ordered.""
But for next year's watch production, she's hopeful that Trump will realize the economic blow to businesses and individuals and reverse his stance on tariffs just like he did with the TikTok ban. Otherwise, tariffs will no doubt affect the pricing of 2026 smartwatches.
Hand Orellana also cautioned against panic buying: ""I know a lot of people who are stocking up on products right now because of tariffs, and I can't help feeling that this doomsday-style planning is just going to leave me with a pile of stuff,"" she says. 
If you're in the market for a new set of headphones or earbuds, CNET executive editor David Carnoy says pricing will likely remain the same for existing inventory already in stores. 
""But as inventory is depleted, prices could rise if the tariffs remain in place. And all bets are off for new products coming to market,"" Carnoy says. 
Current products should remain stable, but we could be in for ""sticker shock"" with new product releases from big names later this year. Carnoy has already seen Edifier increase its price of the NeoBuds Planar; they were initially set to be launched at $200, but when they hit the market on March 11, they were adjusted to $300 due to an increase in tariffs.
""As Edifier did, companies will bake in the price increase at launch. We were seeing $10 to $20 inflationary price increases on more premium next-gen earbuds and headphones even before the tariffs. We could see $40 to $50 price increases now with new products,"" Carnoy warns.
Preorders of the Nintendo Switch 2 are already delayed due to the tariffs.
The question is whether retailers will instantly begin raising prices, or whether new pricing would only apply to inventory that's imported from now on, CNET senior editor and gaming writer David Lumb says. He advises buying before the next restock in the next few days or the next week or two, just to make absolutely sure, if a purchase is something you've already budgeted for.
""If you really want a console already on the market, my instinct is to buy before the next restock to make absolutely sure -- whether that means in the next few days or the next week or two,"" Lumb advises. ""Companies are reeling now, but still selling.""
The Nintendo Switch 2, introduced this week, is also likely to be affected. It won't be available until June 5, but already US preorders of the Switch 2 have been delayed due to the tariffs. Preorders of the Switch 2 were supposed to begin on April 9, with a starting price of $450. It's not yet known whether the pricing will increase, or what date preorders will begin.
""If people want a console currently on the market, like the PS5 or Xbox Series X, it might be smart to buy now,"" Lumb says. ""Even if retailers don't need to raise prices, they might anyway out of uncertainty, panic or greed.""
Like laptops and phones, the biggest worry is over the internal components of gaming PCs. ""These will almost surely get hit with tariff-related increases -- especially since many are made by smaller companies than Nintendo, Sony or Microsoft that can absorb some or all of these tariff increases (if they want),"" Lumb says. 
Several factors have already made GPUs a high-cost component, and this will likely only worsen with tariffs.
""GPUs have seen skyrocketing prices in the last 6 to 8 years due to successive event trends that caused scarcity -- namely the crypto mining craze and pandemic-related supply chain issues, during which the world's biggest GPU maker, Nvidia, steadily raised its prices,"" Lumb explains. That, combined with its central role in the gen AI boom, caused stocks to skyrocket and Nvidia to become one of the richest companies in the world, he says. ""So they won't blink at raising GPU prices even more.""
AMD told CNET that while semiconductors are exempt from the new tariffs, it is ""assessing the details and any impacts on our broader customer and partner ecosystem.""
As for handheld gaming consoles, like the Steam Deck, Lenovo Go S and the other smaller PC-on-the-go handhelds, Lumb predicts tariff pricing increases will kick in pretty quickly as these devices ""don't have the institutional resistance to keep prices low.""
""If you're thinking about a handheld, it's probably better to buy one now,"" he advises.
So the gamers who are most advised to ""buy now"" are those buying PCs or handheld gaming devices. 
Acer prices have already gone up.
The tariffs are going to require buyers to be smart shoppers, hunting for bargains.
""I've already seen prices increase on laptops since the threat of tariffs were known,"" says Matthew Elliott, CNET senior editor for laptops and computers. ""But most vendors and online retailers offer rotating sales, so you can still find a good deal if you have the time and patience to monitor pricing, and time your purchase for when a discount hits the model you want.""
Tariffs have already affected laptop pricing. Acer CEO Jason Chen said in February that the company would raise its prices by 10% in anticipation. ""We will have to adjust the end user price to reflect the tariff,"" the CEO of the Taiwan-based company said. ""We think 10 (percent) probably will be the default price increase because of the import tax. It's very straightforward.""
Even if computer companies want to shift and obtain their parts from the US, it's not likely to be practical.
""All computers and peripherals are likely to be touched by these global tariffs in some way,"" says Josh Goldman, CNET managing editor for computers. ""While there are companies big and small that assemble PCs in the US and there are US component makers, it's unlikely all parts can currently be sourced from US manufacturers.""
His advice is to get that computer soon if you need one, but -- as Elliott notes above -- look for sales and deals, like the upcoming Memorial Day sales.
""I wouldn't wait to see if prices go up and out of financial reach,"" Goldman recommends. ""That said, spring is typically filled with sales on tech for Memorial Day weekend, dads and grads and then back-to-school. Discounts might not be as deep as in the past, but if you keep an eye on a model you want, you should be able to minimize the impact of the tariffs on your purchase.""
One tiny bit of good news is that you may not have to worry about the pricing of used and refurbished tech devices and laptops. They could be a good way to save money and keep tech out of landfill.
But don't get too excited: ""If the tariffs do drastically increase the prices on new computers for an extended time, it's possible even the prices on refurbished devices will go up with demand,"" Goldman warns.
Now's a good time to buy a smart doorbell like the Google Nest.
Now is also a good time to buy smart home tech like higher-end security cameras, video doorbells, smart thermostats and smart displays, according to the advice of Tyler Lacoma, CNET smart home and home security editor. Especially if you're eyeing home devices in the over-$200 price point.
""The impact of tariffs will be most noticeable among smart home technology that already has higher prices,"" Lacoma says. 
But don't expect to find a secret cache of smart-home products that will go untouched by the tariffs.
""Home tech devices are a combination of computer chips, electronic components and many different frame materials,"" he says. ""I doubt there is any device that will be unaffected by the latest tariff news.""
If you've got a camera on your wish list, you shouldn't wait to buy it, says CNET senior writer Jeff Carlson -- who's written numerous books about photography and who co-hosts the PhotoActive.co podcast.
""I hate to inspire panic-buying, but I'd say if you're already planning on buying a camera now but wanted to wait until the next revision rolls around, it's possible that waiting will cost you more,"" Carlson warns.
A lot of camera equipment comes from Japan, and as recently as a week ago, some photography experts were hoping that country wouldn't be affected by the tariffs. But Carlson still found himself in an exceptionally crowded camera store recently, as buyers worried that any electronics from Asia might jump in price.
""And now we know that Japan is included, so they were right to come in,"" Carlson notes.
Electric vehicle chargers could also see a price hike due to new tariffs.
Most Americans can't rush out and stock up on SUVs just because of the new tariffs, even though car prices will almost certainly go up. But you might not realize that vehicles aren't the only automotive item that will be affected -- things like dashboard cameras and EV chargers for your home could also become more expensive.
""The tariffs will also likely affect automotive parts and accessories, so if you're on the fence about picking up a dash cam, portable jump starter or extra EV charger, now might be a good time to pull the trigger,"" says Antuan Goodwin, CNET writer and automotive and EVs expert.
The tariffs aren't good news for car junkies, Goodwin notes.
""Many of the tariffs are laser-targeted at the automotive industry, so there's not much that won't be affected,"" he says. ""From the vehicles themselves to the parts they're made of, consumers should expect that everything automotive, even for domestic makes, will get more expensive.""
The tariffs could also mean more expensive repairs and replacement parts for the cars we already own."
48,2025-04-04,"The jobs report covered a period before Trump's new tariffs on April 2.
Hiring surged in March, blowing past economists' expectations and accelerating job growth from the previous month, a fresh jobs report on Friday showed.
Still, investors shrugged off the backward-looking data as stocks suffered a second day of selloffs over sweeping new tariffs announced by President Donald Trump earlier this week.
The U.S. added 228,000 jobs in March, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That figure amounted to robust hiring and marked a major increase from 151,000 jobs added in the previous month.
The unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4.2%, but it remains historically low.
The uptick in hiring last month came despite staff cuts imposed by the federal government amid cost-cutting efforts undertaken by the Department of Government Efficiency.
Federal government employment declined by 4,000 jobs in March, following a dropoff of 11,000 jobs the previous month.
The job gains came primarily in health care, transportation and warehousing.
Average hourly wages climbed 3.8% over the year ending in March, indicating that pay increases outpaced the inflation rate over that period.
Despite escalating trade tensions and market turbulence since Trump took office in January, the economy remains in solid shape by several key measures.
The unemployment rate stands at a historically low level. Meanwhile, inflation sits well below a peak attained in 2022, though price increases register nearly a percentage point higher than the Fed's goal of 2%.
""The economy is strong,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference in Washington, D.C., last month.
Tariffs announced earlier this week, however, threaten to derail hiring and worsen inflation, multiple analysts previously told ABC News.
The far-reaching levies increase the likelihood of a recession by driving up prices, sapping consumer spending, slowing business activity and risking layoffs, they said.
The White House plans to slap a 10% tax on all imported products and place additional duties on items from some of the largest U.S. trading partners, including China and the European Union.
""​​These policies, if sustained, would likely push the U.S. and global economy into recession this year,"" J.P. Morgan said in a note to clients after the tariff announcement.
""Recession risks will likely rise,"" Deutsche Bank added.
U.S. stocks plunged on Thursday in the first trading session after Trump unveiled the new tariffs.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 1,679 points, or nearly 4%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq declined almost 6%.
The S&P 500 tumbled 4.8%, marking its worst trading day since 2020.

51,2025-04-04,"American companies looking to sell into the huge Chinese market have just taken a big hit. A 34% price increase on all US goods entering the country will knock some out of here altogether.
This is especially bad for US agricultural producers. They already had 10 or 15% tariffs on their produce entering China, in response to the last round of Trump tariffs. Now, if you add 34% on top of that, it is probably pricing most of them out.
Beijing doesn't seem too worried about looking elsewhere for more chicken, pork and sorghum and – at the same time – it knows it is whacking the US president right in his heartland.
Globally, all of this has analysts worried.
The problem is that supply chains have become so international, components in any given product could be sourced from all corners of the planet.
So, when the ripples of economic distress start spreading from country to country, it could have potentially catastrophic consequences for all trade.
Most concerning is that the world's two greatest economies are now at each other's throats with no indication that either is preparing to backdown.
Just take the timing of Beijing's announcement.
The Chinese government revealed its promised ""resolute countermeasures"" to Trump's latest tariffs in a written statement from the finance ministry at 18:00 local time (10:00 GMT), on a Friday night, which is also a public holiday.
The timing could mean several things.
1. It wanted to somewhat bury the news at home, so as to not spook people too much.
2. It simply made the announcement as soon as its own calibrations had been finalised.
3. Beijing had given up on the hope of using the small window it had before Trump's 54% tariffs on Chinese goods took effect next week to do a deal. So, the government just decided to let it rip.
If it is the last of these reasons, that is pretty bleak news for the global economy because it could mean that a settlement between the world's superpowers could be harder to reach than many had expected.
Another indicator of President Xi's attitude towards President Trump's tariffs can be seen by what he was doing when they were announced.
Elsewhere, governments may have been glued to the television, hoping to avoid the worst from Washington.
Not here.
Xi and the six other members of the Politburo Standing Committee were out planting trees to draw attention to the need to counter deforestation.
It presented a kind of calmness in the face of Trump, giving off a vibe along the lines of: do your best Washington, this is China and we're not interested in your nonsense. 
There is still room for the US and China to cut some sort of deal, but the rhetoric does not seem to be heading that way.
Another possible path is for China to increase its trade with other countries – including western nations once seen as close allies of the US – and for these new routes to essentially cut America out of the loop.
Again, this would hurt not only US companies but also US consumers who will already be paying higher prices thanks to Trump's tariffs.

A severe drop in the stock markets has resulted from the first two days after Trump’s Liberation Day announcement, which imposes significant tariffs on companies bringing goods into the U.S. from other countries. The VIX Index is nearing 5-year highs. These increased costs and volatility are casting a shadow over U.S. stock markets. 
President Donald Trump’s Liberation Day announcement introduced a sweeping set of international tariffs on goods brought into the U.S. While 4:00 p.m. may seem like an odd time to announce such a large-scale change to foreign economic policy, an alternative motive was that he did not want his announcement to occur when the main U.S. stock exchanges were open, leading to side-by-side screens of his remarks and the stock market’s response.
He was right to be cautious, as the ensuing two days of trading were marked by significant selloffs in the stock market. Indexes like the Nasdaq have fallen into bear market territory, suggesting that the group of stocks is significantly below its recent peak value.
Given the complexities of the stock market and the global economy, it can be challenging to understand why something like a tariff can have such a significant effect.
A tariff is the price one pays to bring goods from one country into another. While it does not meet the strict definition of a tax, it has several complementary aspects, such as being collected by national governments and the proceeds used to cover government services costs.
Unlike taxes, governments levy tariffs on foreign businesses’ exports of goods to the destination country. While the goods are now more expensive to bring to that country, businesses typically do not absorb those costs and pass them on to the consumers. This notion leads to several different economic reasons for having tariffs, such as encouraging the purchase of domestic goods and altering foreign economic policy.
A stock price is the sum of the expected value of future cash flows for that company. As macroeconomic and firm-specific news surface, the expected value of these future cash flows increases or decreases, leading to a corresponding change in the stock price.
A significant increase in tariffs (not unlike those introduced on Liberation Day) may impact stock prices in three ways.
As a company must now pay more to import a good (or a part of a good) into the U.S., it has a clear choice regarding how it responds to these increased costs. If the company absorbs the costs, it will yield lower profits, and the stock price should decrease. If the company passes the costs onto consumers, the consumers will be less able to afford these products, and demand will decrease. If that occurs, the stock price should also decrease. Either way, these increased costs should impose downward pressure on stock prices.
While Trump suggests that the April 2 tariffs were reciprocal, it did not stop countries like China from going further and imposing additional tariffs in response to his announcement. As these tariffs against U.S. companies go into effect, U.S. goods will now be less competitive in those countries, lowering consumer demand for those products. This lower demand for these U.S. company products should result in a decline in the stock price among companies subject to those tariffs.
Over the last three months, many have wondered whether or not the Trump administration will impose tariffs, when these tariffs will go into effect, and if they will be there to stay (or just part of a negotiation tool). As uncertainty increases, consumers tend to spend less, which applies significant downward pressure on corporate profits. In fact, the VIX Index, which tracks stock market volatility, is near five-year highs. This increased uncertainty typically leads to stock price decreases.

While it might be tempting for investors to pull their funds, the amount of time invested typically yields better long-term results than attempting to time the market. However, this week’s events are a good reminder to diversify investments and not only carry higher volatility and risky investments in a portfolio.
If investors are further away from retirement, they will likely be better off by continuing their investments as if nothing happened in anticipation of a rebound. Investors needing these funds sooner may wish to consider taking on lower-risk investments (such as bonds and high-yield savings accounts) to moderate the volatility."

ByWilliam Baldwin,
 Senior Contributor. 
Buy the dip? That takes some fortitude, when world trade is on the verge of collapse, consumers are frightened and businesses can’t plan anything. The U.S. stock market, as measured by the Vanguard Total Stock Market fund, sank a convulsive 5% yesterday.
But don’t see the crash as a buying opportunity, or as a selling opportunity either. Take it as a reminder that your stock portfolio is a long-term asset. Your horizon should be 30 years. You should be aiming to get a piece of the profits corporations will be making in the year 2055. Today’s political antics will be long past.
Picking individual stocks can provide entertainment, and it’s okay to do that with 10% of what you have in the market. Approach this activity with humility. If you have the insight that tariffs will hurt apparel companies, someone else had the same insight ahead of you, and you’ll be selling VF Corporation after it is already down 29%. European drug companies look like buys? Too late. GSK is already up 3.6%.
The other 90% of your equity money should be in a fund. There are 11,460 choices, including all the weird share classes. Use this guide to speed the search.
The table displays 52 Best Buys, all of them exchange-traded, meaning they can be bought and held at any brokerage. The list is sortable, so that you can select for the attributes you want. Click on column heads to get just large companies or get all of them, to invest with a social conscience or not, to aim for dividend-heavy portfolios or not.
Whatever your choices on those fronts, there are two things that you should always care about. A stock ETF should be big and it should be cheap.
Big, so that you can be reasonably confident it won’t go out of business and so you can trade in and out without getting killed by the bid/ask spread. All of the Best Buys are big. They have at least $1 billion of assets and see at least $1 million a day of trading volume.
Cheap, so that your savings don’t get eroded. A competitively priced ETF covering the U.S. stock market will have an annual expense burden no heavier than 3 basis points (0.03%, which is to say, $3 a year for every $10,000 invested). You might pay somewhat more to get something you want badly, such as a portfolio excluding the stocks of wicked corporations, but you shouldn’t pay a lot more.
Some funds earn back a bit of their fees by lending shares to short-sellers. The lending revenue is meaningful only in portfolios that include flaky small companies. At the largest fund, Vanguard Total Stock Market, securities lending recovers for shareholders roughly 1 basis point out of Vanguard’s 3-basis-point fee.
This fund finder includes the best options in several categories of U.S. stock funds. Where there are lots of products clamoring for your attention (how many S&P 500 funds does the world need?), the table selects only a few, favoring those with low expenses, high assets and high trading volumes.
The going commission rate on trading shares of anything, including shares of ETFs, is $0. Your round-trip cost, then, is indicated (but not precisely determined) by the spread between the buying price (“ask”) and what you get when you sell (“bid”). The spread might be to 1 to 3 basis points for a very active ETF, or 6 to 10 basis points for one of the sleepier funds on our table.
Transaction costs, then, are not big over the course of a 30-year holding period. Yes, that should be your time frame. At age 40 you are saving for retirement, at 70 for your grandchildren.
This is not a consideration for someone buying in an IRA or 401(k).
For those buying a total stock market ETF in a taxable account, the news is fairly good. A typical tax rate on dividends (federal base rate, plus federal investment tax, plus state tax) would be something like 25%. Multiply that by the 1.2% dividend yield on such a fund and you have 30 basis points of annual damage.
What about capital gain taxes? Unlike mutual funds, which regurgitate capital gain dividends onto helpless shareholders, stock ETFs rarely distribute taxable gains. You pay tax on appreciation in the fund shares only when you sell. Leave them to your grandchildren and the appreciation is never taxed.
No. It doesn’t tell you anything.
The table includes a few dividend-happy funds because they are in great demand. But trying to boost your yield is kind of stupid.
In an IRA, a high dividend is harmless. In a taxable account, it causes needless damage, and there is no need for it as a source of cash to spend.
If you want to spend 3% of the portfolio, and you are investing in a taxable account, don’t reach for yield. Buy a fund yielding 1.2% and cash in 1.8% of the shares every year.
Tracking error is the discrepancy in returns between an index fund and the index it’s tracking. Fund watchers with too much time on their hands get worked up about tracking errors. But these fluctuations don’t matter. What matters is drag, a chronic shortfall.
A fund that beats its index by 47 basis points one year, then falls behind by 53 the next, has a big tracking error, but its drag is only 3 basis points. (The primary determinant of drag is the expense ratio, although index revisions and securities lending can affect it.) Drag is what determines how well you will do over 30 years.
A fund that beats its index by 2 points one year, then loses by 26 points the next, has a smaller average tracking error than the plus 47 / minus 53 fund. But it’s a worse buy. Its drag averages 12.
Ignore the tracking error. Watch the drag. That means watching the expense ratio.
Sometimes, yes. Overall: probably not.
Factors became quite the fad a few years ago. See Six Magic Potion Funds From Vanguard. 
The idea is that some attribute discernible from financial statements is a marker of future performance. Among the factors that seemed to work, at least when you looked backward: quality (a combination of balance sheet strength and high and steady profit margins), low volatility (in share prices) and momentum (recent favorable price action).
One of the factors Vanguard offered for sale in 2018 was low liquidity. Thinly traded stocks supposedly would have to reward long-term holders for tolerating low liquidity. So you would buy the fund, hold patiently for a few decades and retire rich.
For investors who can’t resist the allure of a beat-the-market scheme, our table offers, reluctantly, factor funds in a few different flavors. These at least have the virtue of keeping their management fees low.
But before you dive in, try this experiment. Go to Vanguard.com and put into its search box VFLQ, the ticker for that low-liquidity fund. No results. The fund must have been liquidated. One surmises that the performance was disappointing.
There is a lesson here, not just about Vanguard, which is on the whole an honorable and straight-shooting money manager, but about all of Wall Street. The products on display are not representative of investor experience. Disappointing funds get memory-holed.
Late on April 3, a day when its trading volume was double the norm, Vanguard’s Total Stock Market ETF was quoted on Morningstar at $264.28 bid, $264.32 ask. If we presume that, at that moment, the true value of the portfolio was $264.30, then either a buyer or a seller was coughing up 2 cents a share to a middleman. The round trip friction would be 4 cents, or a bit more than 1 basis point.
However, it’s quite possible that 1 basis point understates the damage done to small-fry investors like you. To see why, call ticker VTI up on your brokerage screen and refresh every few seconds. You’ll see the price jump up and down 4 or 8 cents. So what happens during the interval between when you submit a trade and when it gets executed?
Put in a market order for a buy and you’ll probably get execution during a momentary uptick. Put in a market sell and maybe the trade happens to occur a few milliseconds later, when the market has turned bearish and the price is down a few cents. The effective real-world bid/ask spread might be wider than the 4 cents visible at any snapshot in time.
High-frequency traders are at work here. They are not in business for their health.
Would a limit order protect you when you’re moving 400 shares of VTI? Probably not, although it might be useful if you’re investing in a more thinly traded fund with a 30-cent bid/ask spread.
Suppose you submit a buy for VTI at $264.30, meaning you won’t pay a cent more, or a sell with that limit, meaning you won’t accept a cent less. A middleman will only execute the trade if it suits his interests. The distinct possibility is that your limit order will be executed if and when the market is whooshing past your price, otherwise ignored. You think you are getting into the middle of the spread, but in reality you are not.
Who’s running the computers in the middle? Any hedge fund or investment bank with an ability to do some complicated hedges is in a position to jump into the fray. But the prime suspects in the case of the Vanguard Total Stock Market fund are the 15 entities that have been creating and redeeming shares of this fund. (Creation and redemption are necessary only on days when buyers greatly outnumber sellers, or vice versa.) One of those “authorized participants” is Citadel Securities, which shows up in a Securities & Exchange Commission filing with $5.3 billion of VTI creation work last year.
Be thankful for the middlemen. The 1 or 3 basis points they peel out of your wallet is a tiny fraction of the trading cost investors incurred in olden times, when stocks traded in eighths and commissions were fixed.
But don’t feel sorry for these market makers, either. Citadel’s main owner is a guy who, when shopping for a pied-à-terre in Manhattan, had $238 million of spare change for the purpose.
Near the opening and closing bells, pricing can be chaotic, creating more opportunity for middlemen to snatch a few extra cents a share. Better times to submit an order: 10 a.m. or 3 p.m."

Adtech company AppLovin has submitted a last-minute bid to acquire TikTok's operations outside China, joining a crowded list of suitors a day before a US TikTok ban is set to take effect.

        AppLovin confirmed it submitted a preliminary ""indication of interest"" to President Donald Trump in a Thursday SEC filing.
    

        The company, which helps developers market and advertise their apps, said in the filing that ""there can be no assurance"" that a transaction involving TikTok would proceed.
    

        It's unclear exactly how AppLovin would finance or structure a deal, given TikTok's vast scale. TikTok's US operations are estimated to have a sale value of $40 billion to $50 billion.
    

        Adam Foroughi, the cofounder and CEO of AppLovin, told Business Insider that the company ""has not had substantive conversations with investors,"" adding that it doesn't need investment for the deal ""but might welcome it"" in some situations.  
    

        Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has previously suggested TikTok's global valuation could exceed $100 billion, potentially reaching $200 billion if its algorithm is included in the calculation. AppLovin has a market capitalization of just over $89 billion.
    

        The bid places AppLovin among a growing list of late-stage suitors vying for TikTok as US lawmakers push for the app's separation from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance.
    

        This week, Amazon put in a last-minute bid to buy TikTok, The New York Times reported. And on Wednesday, Reuters reported that a consortium led by OnlyFans founder Tim Stokely had submitted an intent to bid on TikTok.
    

        They add to a flurry of other names that have been linked to buying TikTok.
    

        Oracle has emerged as a leading contender, according to multiple reports, with a deal reportedly involving oversight of TikTok's US user data.
    

The YouTuber MrBeast said in January that he was part of a group making an all-cash offer for TikTok's US operations.
    

        Other parties linked to a TikTok deal include Microsoft, Walmart, video-sharing platform Rumble, and AI startup Perplexity.
    

        TikTok's future in the US has been uncertain since April 2024, when Congress mandated ByteDance divest TikTok's US business or face a nationwide ban. After taking office in January, Trump extended that deadline by 75 days.
    

        The White House has been directly involved in deal talks as national security concerns remain central to negotiations. On Wednesday, Trump introduced an effective 54% tariff rate on Chinese imports. The president told reporters on Air Force One on Thursday it gives the US ""great power"" to negotiate and a potential bargaining chip in a TikTok deal. On Friday, China announced a 34% tariff on all products imported from the US.

56,2025-04-04,"Google is making a major change to how Android phones handle gaming. Starting with Android 16, any new phone or tablet that hits the market must support a new feature called Host Image Copy. While the name might sound like something only developers care about, the real-world impact is clear: faster load times, less stuttering, and games that run more smoothly overall. And that’s something anyone who games on their phone can appreciate. 
Host Image Copy helps games load their visuals more efficiently by letting the phone’s processor take care of moving image data, rather than relying only on the graphic chip. That frees up resources and helps your games run better. It also cuts down the amount of memory games need to use behind the scenes, which is a win for performance and battery life. That could mean the end of the long pauses and lag spikes that have frustrated mobile gamers for years, or at the very least bolster them with enough speed and performance that it’s more attractive to some players who haven’t decided to buy in on mobile or specifically Android. 
Google is requiring this feature for all new Android 16 devices, meaning developers can build more demanding games without worrying about compatibility. That’s good news not just for flagship phones, but for budget-friendly models too, especially ones sold by retailers like Walmart, where affordable Android devices are a staple.
This change is part of a larger effort by Google to make Android a more competitive platform for gaming. As we’ve seen with past updates, Android’s performance improvements often start in the background before showing up in flashy features, and Host Image Copy is no different. As Android 16 rolls out, users can expect games to look better, run faster, and feel smoother. That means your favorite games on the platform could soon feel a lot more comfortable to really, really get into, which is a change we can all get behind. 
HP has announced several products in its Omen gaming line, including the brand new HP Omen 16 gaming laptop. It's a redesign of the HP Omen 15, updated now with a larger, better screen, the latest hardware under the hood, and some tweaks to the overall look.
Other announcements include an updated Omen 17, a new midrange gaming laptop brand called HP Victus, and a new 25-inch Omen gaming monitor.

After a few months of early developer previews, at Google I/O 2021 Google has finally given us an in-depth look at the nest-generation version of Android, Android 12 -- and boy is it an upgrade. The new operating system represents a massive overhaul to the user interface, along with support for new features like stacked widgets, new settings toggles, and more.
Android 12 will be released to the public later this year, likely in September or October. Until then, early builds of it will be available in the form of beta releases, though we don't recommend installing those on your primary devices considering the fact that they likely have bugs that could impact usage of your phone.

    Experts say mortgage interest rates could see volatility with the increased risk of a global trade war and recession.
  
President Trump's announcement this week of an aggressive wave of reciprocal tariffs on multiple countries and a 10% universal import tax triggered massive stock market chaos. The move also escalated fears of inflated consumer prices, a global trade war and a recession.  
It's unclear how these duties will upend supply chains and impact interest rates. With the vast number of unknowns in the economy — from Trump's protectionist measures to federal jobs slashing — mortgage rates have already seen some dips this week. In March, mortgage rates fluctuated in a narrow range, with the average 30-year fixed rate beginning and ending the month at 6.75%, according to Bankrate data. 
Volatility is still in the cards as financial markets brace for more conclusive takeaways on inflation and unemployment. Generally, mortgage rates, which are linked to the bond market, inch down when economic data is weaker and inch up when that data comes in strong. 
""The keyword right now is uncertainty,"" said Colin Robertson, founder of mortgage news site The Truth About Mortgage. ""Nobody knows what tomorrow holds when it comes to tariffs or government policies, and thus mortgage rates are in a holding pattern of sorts."" 
While average rates are expected to gradually move closer to 6% in 2025, Robertson said the concern is that lower mortgage rates could be the result of a deteriorating economy. If US families are worried about job security and affording the high cost of living, they'll be less likely to take on mortgage debt, even if rates get cheaper in a downturn. 
While tariffs won't impact the prices of existing homes, they are likely to drive up the cost of lumber and building materials used to construct new homes. That could lead to fewer new homes being built. ""However, builders might find it challenging to pass on these costs to buyers due to limited pricing power,"" said Mohtashami. ""The overall effect of tariffs on home prices is likely to be minimal,"" he added. 
The more significant concern is what widespread tariffs and an escalating trade war could mean for mortgage rates. Economists worry that an uptick in prices and retaliation from other countries could hamper the Fed's plans to lower interest rates. Mortgage rates, which are highly sensitive to fiscal policy and economic growth, could increase if inflation stays elevated. 
Steep rates would not only worsen affordability for buyers, but would also discourage sellers from listing their homes for sale, further constricting the already limited inventory of homes for sale. According to Mohtashami, mortgage rates and the limited supply of existing housing have the biggest impact on the housing market. 
Even if the Fed doesn't cut its benchmark rate soon, talk of a recession alone can put downward pressure on mortgage rates. In times of high economic uncertainty, investors tend to flock to safer assets, like US Treasury bonds. 
Increased demand for bonds can push bond yields down and lead to lower mortgage rates, said Odeta Kushi, deputy chief economist at First American Financial Corporation.
A weaker economy could provide some temporary borrowing relief in time for the home shopping season. ""Lower rates normally generate more homebuying demand,"" said Rob Cook, CMO at Discover Home Loans. But if cheaper mortgages are a by-product of a shaky economy, it could also keep the housing market frozen.
Put simply, a recession won't improve housing affordability over the long term. ""If consumers are uncertain about their own financial futures they will likely pause those plans until they have greater certainty and stronger confidence,"" said Cook. 
Already, rumors of a potential economic downturn are weighing heavy on consumer confidence. ""Falling consumer sentiment can be a warning sign for the economy,"" said Kushi. ""The concern is that consumer sentiment can harden into sediment.""

In recent years, high mortgage rates have locked out new homebuyers. Expensive interest rates have also contributed to keeping resale housing inventory tight, as current homeowners refuse to give up the cheaper, sub-5% mortgage rates they scored just a few years ago. 
If lenders reduce rates in time for the spring season, we could see an increase in homebuying. A slowdown in the economy could also encourage the Federal Reserve to resume cutting interest rates this summer, making overall borrowing less costly. 
But even as rates and prices stay stuck, there has been a modest uptick in homebuyers entering the market. ""For the first time in several years, we are witnessing encouraging trends in purchase application data,"" said Logan Mohtashami, lead analyst at HousingWire. 
After years of buyers sitting on the sidelines, the pent-up demand for houses is likely to explode at some point. ""At least some potential homebuyers have become accustomed (or resigned) to mortgage rates at current levels,"" said Keith Gumbinger, vice president at HSH.com.
Prospective homebuyers waiting for mortgage rates to drop for the past few years may soon have to adjust to the ""higher for longer"" rate environment, with mortgage loan rates fluctuating between 5% and 7% over the longer term. 
Rates around 6% may seem high compared to the recent 2% rates of the pandemic era. But experts say getting below 3% on a mortgage is unlikely without a severe economic downturn. Since the 1970s, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has been around 7%. 
Today's unaffordable housing market is a result of a combination of high mortgage rates, a long-standing housing shortage, expensive home prices and a loss of purchasing power due to inflation. While market forces are out of your control, there are ways to make buying a home slightly more affordable. 
Here's what experts recommend if you're in the market for a home in 2025: 
💰 Build your credit score. Your credit score will help determine whether you qualify for a mortgage and at what interest rate. A credit score of 740 or higher will help you qualify for a lower rate.
💰 Save for a bigger down payment. A larger down payment allows you to take out a smaller mortgage and get a lower interest rate from your lender. If you can afford it, a down payment of at least 20% will also eliminate private mortgage insurance.
💰 Shop for mortgage lenders. Comparing loan offers from multiple mortgage lenders can help you negotiate a better rate. Experts recommend getting at least two to three loan estimates from different lenders.
💰 Consider mortgage points. You can get a lower mortgage rate by buying mortgage points, with each point costing 1% of the total loan amount. One mortgage point equals a 0.25% decrease in your mortgage rate."

When it comes to durability and reliability, rugged smartphones used to be the go-to solution in the mobile market. But with many phones today now boasting high resistance to accidents and the elements, the territory of these tank-like devices gets increasingly smaller every year. Sure, they’re still built like tanks and can survive a beating much longer than the most durable premium smartphone, but the trade-offs sometimes become too much for their cost.
That’s why we’re now seeing these chunky smartphones bearing features that are not always related to their original purpose. Whether it’s a built-in projector or a detachable wireless earbud, rugged smartphones are starting to experiment with designs that, truth be told, sometimes look and sound bizarre. This latest addition to that roster, for example, sounds like a playground for a variety of disparate features, some of which have been tried before and ultimately faded into the background.
Designer: Ulefone







While the cameras on the back of our smartphones are evolving by leaps and bounds, the ones on the front continue to be shackled by a lack of space. Once upon a time, some designers had the bright idea to put a second but smaller screen on the back of the phone, allowing you to use any of the more powerful rear cameras for selfies, live streams, video calls, and more. That feature proved to be an unnecessary added expense that didn’t gain much traction, and it quietly disappeared from the scene.

The Ulefone Armor 30 Pro is trying to revive that with a 3.4-inch 960×412 screen on its back, providing those same benefits but with an added layer of Gorilla Glass protection. It can mirror the main screen so that you can use it for those aforementioned purposes, though it seems you can only operate one screen at a time even if both screens are displaying the same thing. Still, it’s pretty unexpected for a rugged phone to put a potentially breakable component on what would normally be a “safe” side.






Another odd feature is the 4W 118dB loudspeaker in the middle of the hexagonal camera bump, a feature that only makes sense if you’re playing music or watching videos for a lot of people. Not exactly the primary use case of traditional rugged smartphones that were primarily targeted at industrial or field workers. Then again, these smartphones are also starting to break away from that image and aim for more “normal” applications.


To that end, the Ulefone Armor 30 Pro is really a smorgasbord of features, making it feel more like a mosaic than a well-composed painting. It has a triple camera system with 50MP main and ultra-wide cameras joined by a 64MP “Night Vision” camera that’s assisted by four IR LED blasters. The 12,800mAh battery easily excuses the bulkiness of the phone, especially when you consider that it can be used as a rather slow 10W power bank. There’s a dedicated camera shutter button, as well as pogo pin contacts for attaching Ulefone endoscopes and microscopes.


Considering all these features, plus actually decent mid-range hardware, at least on paper, it’s rather shocking that the Ulefone Armor 30 Pro costs only $379.99. Then again, you are paying not only for features you might not use but also for a phone that will not comfortably fit in your pocket. It does seem that the rugged smartphone market has turned a bit into a Wild West of the mobile industry, throwing any and all features on a wall to see which ones stick.

60,2025-04-04,"The effects of Tesla’s (TSLA) “unprecedented” brand damage have surprised even analysts at J.P. Morgan (JPM), who had already described the backlash against CEO Elon Musk as without equal in the history of the automotive industry.
“Tesla’s 1Q sales and production report causes us to think that — if anything — we may have underestimated the degree of consumer reaction,” analysts led by Ryan Brinkman said in a Friday note.
Tesla has become an easy target for protesters angered by Musk’s support of President Donald Trump and Musk’s work in the federal government leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Nonviolent, anti-Tesla protests have been held across the U.S. and other countries, while vandalism against the company’s customers and facilities has ramped up.
Austin, Texas-based Tesla delivered 336,681 electric vehicles between January and March, well below Wall Street’s lowered expectations; J.P. Morgan, for example, had a 355,041-unit forecast, which was below the consensus. This period marked Tesla’s worst quarterly sales performance since 2022 and its poorest compared to Wall Street’s consensus.
Deepwater Asset Management’s Gene Munster, a Tesla bull, estimates that Tesla lost about 80,000 deliveries as a result of brand damage. Fellow bull, Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, called the sales report a “disaster on every metric” and said there’s no debate as to whether Musk’s politics are hurting Tesla. 
Brinkman’s team notes that the last time deliveries fell short by a similar degree, in the first quarter of 2024, sales fell by 10% below expectations. Several analysts have lowered their full-year sales expectations for Tesla by tens of thousands of vehicles.
“We see risk to deliveries and earnings expectations for every quarter going forward,” the J.P. Morgan analysts wrote. That will be especially true in the April to June quarter, as Tesla’s sales and brand equity “appear to be losing rather than gaining momentum.”
J.P. Morgan expects first-quarter earnings per share of 36 cents, compared with its earlier 40 cents per share estimate and Wall Street’s 46 cents per share consensus. Full-year earnings are forecast to come in at $2.30 per share, down from an earlier forecast that called for $2.35 per share and the $2.70 per share consensus. Brinkman expects second-quarter sales to reach 404,000, down from 462,890 last year.
Tesla shares have slid about 30% this year as of the market’s close Thursday, largely due to the backlash against Musk. After a report confirmed that Musk would be leaving his official government job by June at the latest (due to the nature of his employee designation), the stock soared. He’s expected to stay on as a “friend and advisor” to the White House after his official departure, according to Vice President J.D. Vance.
Tesla’s stock dropped 5% in pre-market trading Friday as the broader market continued to decline on the back of Trump’s new tariffs. The U.S.’ 25% tariffs on foreign vehicles — and later, vehicle parts — will affect Tesla, according to Musk and chief financial officer Vaibhav Taneja.
In a recent letter to the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), Tesla said that even with “aggressive” localization of the supply chain, some parts are “difficult or impossible” to source domestically. Between 60% and 75% of the parts used in Tesla’s electric vehicles are made in the U.S., although that varies by model.

If you thought the cost of groceries was high before, economists and supply chain experts have some bad news.

        President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced sweeping 10% tariffs on goods from any country imported into the United States, and even higher tariffs for 60 trading partners with a persistent trade deficit with the US.
    

        The wide-reaching ""Liberation Day"" tariffs impact countries including China and Japan, as well as the European Union, and territories near Antarctica inhabited only by penguins. Theycome in addition to existing tariffs against the United States' top trade partners, Canada and Mexico.
    

        For consumers, the increased import costs caused by Trump's aggressive tariff plan are expected to result in higher prices for everything from pantry staples like coffee and sugar to apparel and larger purchases like cars and appliances.
    

        Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale, said the price hikes are expected to increase the overall price level of goods in the United States by 2.3%, costing the average consumer household about $3,800 this year.
    

        Tedeschi told Business Insider that the existing tariffs against Mexico and Canada alone account for an expected 1% price increase of about $1,700 per household. The ""Liberation Day"" tariffs announced Wednesday are expected to result in a further 1.3% hike, or $2,100 per household.
    

        ""So 1.3% may not sound like a lot to the normal person, but $2,100 is a meaningful amount,"" Tedeschi said. ""Now, of course, that's an average, so if you open up the hood to that number, there's a distribution beneath that number.""
    

        The exact intention behind Trump's tariff plan remains unclear — the president says his main goal is to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, but some analysts suspect he may be trying to trigger a recession to reduce interest rates purposely — and the stock market has tanked in response to the uncertainty.
    

        Imports from some countries will be hit with higher tariffs than others, driving uneven price hikes across industries. For example, China — which largely imports machinery and appliances, furniture, toys, and electronics to the US —will be subject to a 54% tariff when combining the new tariffs (34%) with ones that have been previously announced. Goods from the European Union, which primarily imports medical and pharmaceutical products and motor vehicles, will be subject to a new 20% tariff.
    

        Tedeschi said the cost of clothing items is expected to increase by about 8%. He added that pantry staples like sugar and coffee are expected to increase in price by about 1.3%, while fresh produce is likely to increase by about 2.2%.
    

        ""The luxury of eating our favorite fruits and vegetables regardless of the season is based on global imports with much coming from Central and South America,"" Margaret Kidd, an instructional associate professor of supply chain and logistics technology at the University of Houston, told BI. ""Tariffs will make many of these staples unaffordable.""
    

        The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement in 2020, maintains NAFTA's zero-tariff treatment for most agricultural products, textiles, apparel, and other goods that meet the trade agreement's rules of origin. But while the United States gets much of its produce from neighboring Mexico tariff-free, including tomatoes, avocados, and strawberries, other imports will face new price hikes — like grapes from Peru or bananas and mangoes from the Philippines.
    

        ""The USMCA is still in effect, so there are fruits and vegetables still covered under the deal and are tariff-free, but then some of them, they are not covered,"" Chris Tang, a UCLA professor who's an expert in global supply chain management and the impact of regulatory policies, told Business Insider.
    

        Of course, consumers and businesses alike will try to find substitutions. Still, Tedeschi said it takes time to carve out new supply chain routes, for stores to expand their offerings, and for customers to find suitable alternatives to their typical favorites.
    

        ""So you may, literally and figuratively, eat the price increase in the short run, as you're figuring out what a proper substitute is, but there are areas where there will be substitutions available,"" Tedeschi said. ""Let's say coffee, for example, imported from Colombia. If Starbucks has a supply chain agreement with Colombia, over time, they'll be able to shift that to another country or another supplier to mitigate the cost of the tariff, perhaps. Whereas, in the short run, like, in a month, Starbucks is not going to be able to do that, so if you want your latte, you're going to have to pay extra.""
    

        Some, like ""Shark Tank"" star Mark Cuban, have suggested Americans start stockpiling goods now to avoid price hikes. They say retailers may raise prices and ""blame it on tariffs,"" even if their goods are US-made. While the experts who spoke to Business Insider say that may be true, panic buying might further hurt supply chains and cause prices to go up, too.
    

        ""This kind of shift in demand would actually exacerbate this price increase,"" Tang said. ""If the demand is more stable, then the price is more stable. If everyone starts stocking up on toothpaste and toilet paper, the prices go higher.""
    

        And that's just the immediate impact on everyday consumable items.
    

        The Consumer Technology Association estimated in a January report that Trump's tariffs could increase the price of laptops and tablets by 46-68%, video game consoles by 40-58%, and smartphones by 26-37%.
    

Car imports will see tariffs of upward of 25%, which could translate to $12,000 or more based on an average car price of $48,000. Some automakers have responded to the tariffs by offering employee pricing deals, while others paused work at their factories and started cutting staff, Business Insider previously reported.
    

        Not every household will be affected by the tariffs similarly, either. In response to Trump's trade plan, Tedeschi said, lower-income households will spend about two and a half times more of their share of income than the highest-earning households will.
    

        Kidd said pharmaceuticals, which represent $251 billion of imports, will face tariffs from 20% to more than 50%, which will disproportionately burden Americans without insurance and may set the path toward an increased deductible for those covered under an employer health plan.
    

        ""Lower income households are more likely to purchase imports. They spend a larger share of their income than higher income households do, and so they are more vulnerable to tariffs than higher income households are,"" Tedeschi said. ""And obviously people care about food for food's sake, but that also has distributional implications as well. The more the price of food goes up, the more that disproportionately affects lower-income families as well.""

The broader market is currently experiencing a significant downturn, with a 5% fall in the S&P 500 yesterday followed by another 4% decline today. This negative market reaction is attributed to President Donald Trump's recent announcement of sweeping tariffs on goods from over 100 countries. These tariffs have sparked concerns about a potential trade war, which could reignite inflation and negatively impact the broader U.S. economy and consumer spending. Further details on the potential impact of these tariffs on market crash risk can be found in our analysis.
Amidst this broader market weakness, Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) stock appears to be an attractive opportunity. Recent discussions between President Trump and the President of Vietnam regarding a potential bilateral agreement, which could eliminate tariffs, are likely benefiting Crocs and Nike stocks. This potential tariff reduction, leading to lower costs, and coupled with Crocs' strong profitability (as discussed below), is a probable driver of the recent spike in their stock price.
While it’s true that CROX carries some risks, particularly its historical weak resilience to market downturns, these concerns seem to be already well-captured in its currently cheap valuation. With strong underlying fundamentals, including solid revenue growth and profitability, CROX presents a compelling case for investors. Our analysis, which compares CROX stock’s current valuation against its recent operating performance and current and historical financial condition, suggests that the current low price offers a potentially attractive entry point, especially considering the company's fundamental strengths. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception.
Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, CROX stock looks cheap compared to the broader market.
Crocs' Revenues have seen some growth over recent years.
Crocs' profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe.
Crocs' balance sheet looks weak.
CROX stock has fared much worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on CROX stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Crocs Stock Go In A Market Crash? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes.
In summary, Crocs' performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows:
While our analysis across the above parameters indicates moderate overall performance for CROX stock, its strong profitability coupled with its current low valuation makes it an attractive investment opportunity, ultimately supporting our conclusion that CROX is a good stock to buy.
While CROX stock looks promising, investing in a single stock can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

65,2025-04-04,"The U.S. stock market is in a freefall after President Donald Trump announced his all encompassing tariffs earlier this week, and Trump is trying to crash the stock market on purpose—at least according to a video he reposted to social media Friday riddled with inaccuracies.
The S&P 500 is down more than 13% since Trump won the election in November, with most losses ... More concentrated since he announced his hawkish tariffs Wednesday.
Trump reposted a link on his Truth Social platform Friday morning to the minute-long video which opened: “Trump is crashing the stock market…this month, but he’s doing it on purpose.”
The short video, which promotes several falsehoods or misinformed claims, offers insight into Trump’s thinking behind his new tariffs widely panned among economists and across Wall Street, leading a downright bloodbath in the market, as the S&P 500 index cratered 4.8% Thursday, the worst drop in nearly five years, followed by an even more painful 6% loss Friday.
According to the video, which traces back to a March 15 post from a TikTok account with less than 18,000 followers, Trump is making a “wild chess move” and playing a “secret game” to “force” the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and refinance a chunk of the federal government’s $36 trillion in debt “very inexpensively.”
To that theory’s credit, yields for U.S. Treasury notes, which are a starting point for loans from mortgages to corporate bonds, have collapsed this week, as the benchmark 10-year Treasury fell more than 10 basis points to a six-month low of below 3.9%, which should translate to cheaper borrowing, but it’s arguably little more than a consolation prize if the U.S. sinks into a recession defined by higher inflation, cutting into consumer purchasing power, and far weaker corporate earnings from tariffs.
Lower Treasury yields also can be achieved in a far less damaging fashion, by restoring fixed income investors’ confidence in the federal government’s fiscal health through more austere spending— a narrative shaped the early days of Trump’s second term, when Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency helped grow confidence the U.S. would address its ballooning debt.
And the 10-year Treasury is still far from being at a historically cheap level, as it sat below 3.6% as recently as September and below 3.5% from 2012 to 2021, and yields climbed again Friday afternoon to above 4%.
Trump directly called on the Fed to lower the target federal funds rate in a Friday social media post, writing: “This would be a PERFECT time for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to cut Interest Rates.” Trump has repeatedly demanded for the politically independent Fed to acquiesce to his demands for lower rates dating back to his first presidential term. Powell did not seem interested in meeting Trump’s demands in prepared remarks Friday, observing: “While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected. The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.”
The video Trump reposted claimed he is “taking from the rich short-term and handing it to the middle class through lower prices,” explaining “94% of all stocks are owned only by 8% of Americans.” But this Robin Hood-eque notion of taking from the wealthy to enrich the less fortunate is misguided. For one, economists’ consensus overwhelmingly supports the idea that the president’s tariffs will lead to higher consumer prices. The statistic on stock ownership appears to reference a 2023 Federal Reserve study that 93% of stock market value is owned by the richest 10% of Americans, but that doesn’t mean the other 90% aren’t directly impacted by stock market losses. About 61% of Americans own stocks, according to Gallup, and a majority of Americans have IRA or 401(k) retirement accounts, according to the Census Bureau.
The legendary investor Warren Buffett believes Trump is making the “best economic moves” in five decades, according to the video shared by Trump, but Buffett made no such comments. Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway confirmed the billionaire made no such flattering remarks in a Friday statement, calling the “comments allegedly made by Warren E. Buffett...false.” Buffett’s most recent comments on Trump came in a CBS News interview out last month in which he slammed tariffs, calling them an “an act of war” and a “tax on goods” paid by consumers.
Trump’s celebration of stock losses is a major shift from how he viewed equity market returns as a barometer of presidential success in recent years. “If we lost this election, I think the market would go down the tubes,” Trump said in October, later bragging the “market has gone through the roof” and the stock market is “very important,” also celebrating returns during his first term as an “amazing achievement.” The S&P is down about 13% since November’s election.

66,2025-04-04,"Investors did not get the rebound from Thursday’s historic losses they may have hoped for, as stocks again slid considerably as the market digests President Donald Trump’s tariffs while China, the world’s second-largest economy, slapped a 34% retaliatory tariff on American imports.
A traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.
Thursday was the sharpest daily decline since 2020 for each of the three major U.S. indexes – the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-4%, or 1,680 points, Thursday), the S&P 500 (-5%) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (-6%) – and things got even worse in the market Friday.
The Dow fell 5.5%, or about 2,200 points, by early afternoon, extending its two-day loss to about 4,000 points, while the S&P and Nasdaq fell about 6% apiece Friday, sending the S&P’s and Nasdaq’s declines since Trump’s Wednesday tariff announcement to 11%.
All three indexes are down at least 10% from their record levels set a few months ago, residing in correction territory, and the Nasdaq fell into a bear market as it traded more than 20% below its December all-time high, entering its first bear market since 2022.
Stocks slid to their lowest levels in several months, as the Dow and S&P hit their lowest intraday prices since May and the Nasdaq touched its cheapest level since April 2024.
The S&P’s 9% loss since last Friday makes this stocks’ worst week since March 2020 and the fifth-worst week of the last 20 years, trailing only losses sustained in October 2008 and early 2020.
The selloff wiped out more than $4.9 trillion of market capitalization among stocks listed on the S&P, according to FactSet data, led by Apple, Nvidia and Tesla’s more than $1 trillion combined loss.
In addition to the impact of continued negative sentiment from the 10% or greater tariffs on most imports unveiled Wednesday, investors also reacted sourly to the China-led trade countermeasures and Trump’s lack of capitulation, as the president posted Friday to social media his “POLICIES WILL NEVER CHANGE.” Particularly hard hit were shares of American firms which rely on China for a significant portion of their revenues, as shares of iPhone maker Apple, coffee chain Starbucks and Elon Musk’s automaker Tesla each declined at least 7%. Since Wednesday, the biggest percentage stock losers among American companies valued at $100 billion or greater are ConocoPhillips, Citigroup, Boeing, Bank of America, Starbucks, GE Aerospace, Qualcomm, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Advanced Micro Devices, Wells Fargo and Apple. Shares of each American titan lost 15% or more during the two-day span.
Trump called on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to immediately lower interest rates, but Powell showed no inclination to do so in a Friday speech, saying it is “too soon” to determine the next monetary policy action. Powell did issue a stark warning on the economic fallout of tariffs, saying they will cause “higher inflation and slower growth.”
Thursday and Friday mark one of the few times in modern history the S&P declined 4.8% or more on consecutive days. Over the last two decades, that has only happened three other times: Nov. 5-6 and Nov. 19-20, 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, and March 11-12, 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.
60%. Those are the odds the global economy enters a recession in 2025, JPMorgan economists wrote in a Thursday note to clients.
The Friday losses came despite a better-than-expected March jobs report released before market open, revealing the U.S. added 228,000 jobs last month, far better than consensus economist forecasts of 140,000. It’s a “reminder that economic fundamentals were robust heading into the tariff storm,” EY-Parthenon economist Lydia Boussour wrote in emailed comments, adding “the downside risks to the labor market...have escalated significantly in recent days.”
Crude oil prices sank Friday as recession concerns translated into fears about weaker consumers globally. International benchmark Brent crude prices declined 7% to $65 per barrel, the lowest level since April 2021.  
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), commonly referred to as Wall Street’s fear gauge, is on track to close Friday at its highest level since October 2020, spiking by almost 80% since Wednesday.
A Forbes poll of 50 influential individuals on Wall Street, including billionaire investors, big-time money managers and economists, found two-thirds of respondents don’t support Trump’s economic policies during his second term, with more than 70% noting his economic policy rollout has not been effective.
“This is the biggest policy mistake in 95 years,” Jeremy Siegel, a professor at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, Trump’s alma mater, told CNBC on Friday.

67,2025-04-04,"Investors did not get the rebound from Thursday’s historic losses they may have hoped for, as stocks again slid considerably as the market digests President Donald Trump’s tariffs while China, the world’s second-largest economy, slapped a 34% retaliatory tariff on American imports.
A traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.
Thursday was the sharpest daily decline since 2020 for each of the three major U.S. indexes – the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-4%, or 1,680 points, Thursday), the S&P 500 (-5%) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (-6%) – and things got even worse in the market Friday.
The Dow fell 5.5%, or about 2,200 points, by early afternoon, extending its two-day loss to about 4,000 points, while the S&P and Nasdaq fell about 6% apiece Friday, sending the S&P’s and Nasdaq’s declines since Trump’s Wednesday tariff announcement to 11%.
All three indexes are down at least 10% from their record levels set a few months ago, residing in correction territory, and the Nasdaq fell into a bear market as it traded more than 20% below its December all-time high, entering its first bear market since 2022.

68,2025-04-04,"Plans for Klarna Group and StubHub Holdings to go public have been paused, as both companies delayed their debuts after far-reaching tariffs announced by President Donald Trump earlier this week sparked a broader market selloff.
Far-reaching reciprocal tariffs for U.S. trade partners were announced earlier this week. 
The companies cited instability in the stock market, and neither company has a timeline for when they will pursue an offering, people with knowledge of the plans for both companies told CNBC and The Wall Street Journal.
StubHub, which filed for an IPO in March, decided to delay a meeting scheduled next week with prospective investors after the S&P 500 dropped by nearly 5% on Thursday, and the company was concerned about launching an IPO while the U.S. markets were volatile, the Journal reported.
Klarna was scheduled to meet with investors next week, but similarly decided to postpone those plans because of volatile markets, CNBC reported.
Neither Klarna nor StubHub immediately responded to requests for comment.

StubHub previously delayed an IPO in 2024, after the company reportedly couldn’t gauge whether a launch would be beneficial. The company initially pushed back plans for a listing until after Labor Day, and sought a valuation of at least $16.5 billion with backing from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 4.4%, or about 1,770 points, by Friday afternoon, while the S&P 500 (5%) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (6%) also dropped for the third-straight day. Each index is down at least 10% from their record levels set in recent months—putting them in correction territory—while the Nasdaq entered a bear market as it traded more than 20% below its all-time high set in December. There’s a 60% chance the global economy enters a recession this year, JPMorgan economists wrote in a note Thursday.
The artificial intelligence firm CoreWeave debuted last week, but trading in the company’s stock has been largely volatile. Shares in CoreWeave dropped by more than 12% on Friday, though the stock is up 23% since its debut. The right-wing media company Newsmax debuted on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday and quickly soared, with shares trading up by more than 700% that day alone. Newsmax subsequently became more valuable than Fox Corp. as shares traded up again Tuesday, increasing the company’s market cap to just below $30 billion. Shares in Newsmax then dropped in value through Friday, as the stock fell from a high of about $265 to just over $48.
Both Klarna and StubHub filed IPO registration forms with the Securities and Exchange Commission in March. Klarna, a Swedish firm offering “buy now, pay later” loan options, reported a 24% increase in revenue through 2024, while ticket resale platform StubHub revealed a 30% revenue increase. Goldman Sachs backed offerings for Klarna and StubHub, as the companies planned to list on the NYSE under the tickers KLAR and STUB. Their decision to postpone their IPOs follows what Trump called “Liberation Day” on Wednesday, during which the U.S. imposed reciprocal tariffs on more than 180 trade partners. Analysts across several industries expect those tariffs to increase prices for numerous goods, including new cars, wine, chocolate and coffee, among others.

70,2025-04-04,"On Friday, Nintendo announced that players won’t be able to pre-order a Switch 2 on April 9. The company directly blamed President Donald Trump’s planned  tariffs against basically every country on the planet (except Russia and North Korea, weirdly) for the delay. This has led to some people and analysts online to predict a price increase on the $450 console. 
This was explained in a statement from Nintendo, first obtained by GameSpot: 
Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.
To be clear: The Switch 2 is currently still priced at $450 and is still set to launch in June. None of that has changed. For now. However, with this news and the ongoing backlash from players over game prices, I’d say a lot of the Switch 2's rollout and pricing is up in the air. Perhaps Trump does what he has done in the past and at the last minute delays some or all of the huge tariffs. Maybe they get doubled in some places out of spite. Maybe he declares video games illegal with an executive order. Folks, anything is possible right now. 
It’s very rare that a major video game company like Nintendo would backpedal this quickly after announcing a date for pre-orders. Even weirder for Nintendo of all companies to directly tie its decision to President Trump by calling out his planned tariffs. But we are living in wild and unprecedented times, something I’m remined of every single time I check social media or the news. As you might expect during such a bizarre moment, a lot of people online reacted to the Switch 2 news. 
Here are some of the more entertaining reactions, to distract you for just a few minutes from...everything. "

CHONGQING, CHINA - MARCH 30: In this photo illustration, the logo of RH (formerly known as ... More Restoration Hardware), a luxury home furnishings company, is displayed on a smartphone screen with a background showing the company's recent stock market activity through a candlestick chart, reflecting RH's financial performance, market volatility, and investor sentiment in the premium retail and interior design sectors, on March 30, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo by Cheng Xin/Getty Images)
RH (NYSE:RH), a luxury home furnishings company, saw its stock nosedive 40% on Thursday, April 3. RH’s recently released fourth-quarter earnings of $1.58 per share on $812 million in revenue fell short of consensus estimates, which were $1.92 EPS and $830 million in revenue. The company also issued a full-year sales growth outlook of 10% to 13%, below the consensus forecast of 14%. Adding to the negative news, broader markets were significantly impacted by unexpectedly high tariffs announced by the Trump administration. Our take on market crash risk right now has more details on tariffs and its impact on the broader market. RH’s significant exposure to Asia further contributed to the downturn, ultimately leading to a significant drop in RH's stock price.
 
Even after its recent price decline, we believe RH stock remains unattractive and represents a poor buying opportunity at its current price of around $150. This conclusion is based on our analysis, which compares RH's current valuation to its operating performance over recent years and its current and historical financial condition. Our assessment across key parameters—Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience—indicates that the company exhibits weak operating performance and financial health, as detailed below. Therefore, even considering its moderate valuation, we find RH stock unattractive. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception.
Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, RH stock is currently below the broader market.
RH's Revenues have grown marginally over recent years.
RH’s profit margins are much worse than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe.
RH's balance sheet looks weak.
RH stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes.

In summary, RH's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows:
The stock’s moderate valuation doesn't adequately reflect RH's weak performance across key parameters, making it a very unattractive investment and reinforcing our conclusion that it's a poor buy. The company's financial and operating performance, as well as its resilience to economic downturns, has been weak, and the current high interest rate environment offers little prospect of near-term improvement.
Adding to these concerns, the Trump administration's new tariffs on trade partners are likely to increase inflation, potentially delaying interest rate cuts by the U.S. Fed. Persistently high interest rates will likely keep the housing market subdued, further weighing on RH's performance.
Moreover, RH will bear the brunt of tariffs levied on Asian countries, which will negatively impact its profitability either through margin compression or reduced consumer demand due to price increases. For these reasons, we believe RH remains a bad stock to buy.
While you would do well to avoid RH stock for now, you could explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid- and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

73,2025-04-04,"Despite Trump’s promises not to touch Social Security, Elon Musk’s DOGE has asked for serious cuts to the agency. Critics have accused the billionaire and his team of attempting to cripple America’s retirement system. Now, a new report states that, per DOGE’s orders, the Social Security Administration has plans to fire “potentially thousands” of staffers as soon as next week, in an effort to further downsize the agency and align it with Trump’s “efficiency” mandate.
The Washington Post reports that Musk’s “government efficiency” team has demanded an extensive reduction of workforce throughout the agency. The newspaper describes the effort thusly:
The cuts have been ordered by leaders of Elon Muskâs cost-cutting team, the U.S. DOGE Service, which reviewed the agencyâs plans to shrink its workforce last week, according to four agency officials familiar with the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the plans. DOGE determined that the 7,000 jobs eliminated since February under acting commissioner Leland Dudek through early retirements, buyouts, resignations and firings were not enough, the officials said. The DOGE team, which has amassed unprecedented power throughout the federal government, has demanded significantly deeper cuts to ensure that Social Security meets President Donald Trumpâs goal to shrink federal agencies, officials said.
According to the newspaper, the cuts being demanded by DOGE are across the board. It writes:
The DOGE team did not provide a specific number of jobs that must be eliminated, officials said, but asked for staff reductions to broad areas of operation, including communications, personnel, legislative and congressional affairs, retirement and disability policy, and other âsupport components.â
Among other things, DOGE has asked for severe cuts to the administration’s IT team, the report states. That team is presumably already under a severe amount of strain due to the agency’s recent decision to downsize its phone operationsâa highly controversial move that has forced an influx of traffic to the SSA website. The strain of that traffic has reportedly caused the website to crash multiple times. A senior department official told the Post that as many as 800 people could be laid off from the IT team, which currently has about 4,000 members.
DOGE has already announced lease terminations for dozens of SSA field offices across the country. This policy threatens retirees’ ability to get in-person help when signing up for retirement benefits. Under DOGE, the SSA has also cut phone operations, and, now, will also apparently cut web operations. At the same time, DOGE has claimed that it will re-write the SSA’s “entire codebase” in a matter of months, a move that critics worry could lead to serious digital dysfunction. Social Security activists say it’s pretty clear that DOGE’s ultimate goal is to hobble the agency’s operations and destroy its ability to function.
When reached for comment by Gizmodo, a White House spokesperson told us this: âWith a resounding mandate from the American people, President Trump is moving quickly to fulfill his promise of making the federal government more efficient. He has promised to protect Social Security, and every recipient will continue to receive their benefits.â While failing to dispute anything specific in the Post report, the government further stated that there are currently no finalized RIF (reduction in workforce) plans and that the SSA was merely evaluating the next steps.
If the Trump administration manages to cripple America’s Social Security system while also yanking trillions of dollars out of Americans’ 401ks via an ill-advised, stock-market-killing trade war, it will have effectively nullified the entire concept of “retirement” for the foreseeable future.

TikTok will not be going dark Saturday for the more than 135 million users of the social media app, thanks to Donald Trump.

	Pummeled by bad news and a cratering stock market in response to his global tariffs unveiled Wednesday, aka “Liberation Day,” Trump tried to throw up a distraction Friday with word that he is tossing aside the April 5 deadline he set for a sale or a U.S. ban of the app, giving the ByteDance-owned platform until late June to comply.

	“The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days,” Trump posted today during a break from golfing in Florida. “We hope to continue working in Good Faith with China, who I understand are not very happy about our Reciprocal Tariffs (Necessary for Fair and Balanced Trade between China and the U.S.A.!),” he added, as rumors of various potential bidders like Amazon and Oracle boss and Trump pal Larry Ellison have been in the air all week.

	










			Watch on Deadline		






	An advocate during his first term to shut down TikTok for national security reasons, Trump became opposed to a ban during the 2024 election after Congress and Joe Biden brought in new legislation to curtail the platform. Having distinctly benefited in the last presidential race from TikTok and its powerful algorithm, Trump overturned the ban that went into effect just before he re-took office in January and put the about-to-expire April deadline in place.

	With the now disregarded deadline looming this weekend, the likes of Apple and Google had been nervous of the status of TikTok in their respective app stores and on U.S. servers.

	Never one for details, Trump is now clearly linking the harsh 54% tariffs imposed on China on Tuesday to a TikTok deal. However, there has been no indication from China throughout this process over the past few years that it is actually interested in selling TikTok in part or whole, or how much they would want for it.

	What Beijing has been clear about in the past 24 hours is that it is not taking Trump’s trade war lying down, imposing a 34% tariff of its own on American goods and companies to counter the 34% bump Trump added to the current 20% tariff on the country.

	










	POTUS may be painting this as China having “panicked,” as he said in a post Friday, but the fact is the economic and political fallout has been amplified by the addition of 11 U.S. companies to China’s “unreliable entities” list. Additionally, China announced a new ban on poultry imports for five U.S. food companies and DuPont products, a new restriction on exports to the U.S. of minerals and other mined materials widely used in cellphones and military weapons, plus a probe into other trade deals China has with the U.S.

	That’s clearly no mere dance move video. 

	Deadline reached out to TikTok about Trump’s latest delay, but we did not receive a response.

78,2025-04-04,"Investors did not get the rebound from Thursday’s historic losses they may have hoped for, as stocks again slid considerably as the market digests President Donald Trump’s tariffs while China, the world’s second-largest economy, slapped a 34% retaliatory tariff on American imports.
A traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.
Thursday was the sharpest daily decline since 2020 for each of the three major U.S. indexes – the Dow Jones Industrial Average (-4%, or 1,680 points, Thursday), the S&P 500 (-5%) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (-6%) – and things got even worse in the market Friday.
The Dow fell 5.5%, or about 2,200 points, by early afternoon, extending its two-day loss to about 4,000 points, while the S&P and Nasdaq fell about 6% apiece Friday, sending the S&P’s and Nasdaq’s declines since Trump’s Wednesday tariff announcement to 11%.
All three indexes are down at least 10% from their record levels set a few months ago, residing in correction territory, and the Nasdaq fell into a bear market as it traded more than 20% below its December all-time high, entering its first bear market since 2022.
Stocks slid to their lowest levels in several months, as the Dow and S&P hit their lowest intraday prices since May and the Nasdaq touched its cheapest level since April 2024.
The S&P’s 9% loss since last Friday makes this stocks’ worst week since March 2020 and the fifth-worst week of the last 20 years, trailing only losses sustained in October 2008 and early 2020.
The selloff wiped out more than $4.9 trillion of market capitalization among stocks listed on the S&P, according to FactSet data, led by Apple, Nvidia and Tesla’s more than $1 trillion combined loss.
In addition to the impact of continued negative sentiment from the 10% or greater tariffs on most imports unveiled Wednesday, investors also reacted sourly to the China-led trade countermeasures and Trump’s lack of capitulation, as the president posted Friday to social media his “POLICIES WILL NEVER CHANGE.” Particularly hard hit were shares of American firms which rely on China for a significant portion of their revenues, as shares of iPhone maker Apple, coffee chain Starbucks and Elon Musk’s automaker Tesla each declined at least 7%. Since Wednesday, the biggest percentage stock losers among American companies valued at $100 billion or greater are ConocoPhillips, Citigroup, Boeing, Bank of America, Starbucks, GE Aerospace, Qualcomm, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Advanced Micro Devices, Wells Fargo and Apple. Shares of each American titan lost 15% or more during the two-day span.
Trump called on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to immediately lower interest rates, but Powell showed no inclination to do so in a Friday speech, saying it is “too soon” to determine the next monetary policy action. Powell did issue a stark warning on the economic fallout of tariffs, saying they will cause “higher inflation and slower growth.”
Thursday and Friday mark one of the few times in modern history the S&P declined 4.8% or more on consecutive days. Over the last two decades, that has only happened three other times: Nov. 5-6 and Nov. 19-20, 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, and March 11-12, 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.
60%. Those are the odds the global economy enters a recession in 2025, JPMorgan economists wrote in a Thursday note to clients.
The Friday losses came despite a better-than-expected March jobs report released before market open, revealing the U.S. added 228,000 jobs last month, far better than consensus economist forecasts of 140,000. It’s a “reminder that economic fundamentals were robust heading into the tariff storm,” EY-Parthenon economist Lydia Boussour wrote in emailed comments, adding “the downside risks to the labor market...have escalated significantly in recent days.”
Crude oil prices sank Friday as recession concerns translated into fears about weaker consumers globally. International benchmark Brent crude prices declined 7% to $65 per barrel, the lowest level since April 2021.  
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), commonly referred to as Wall Street’s fear gauge, is on track to close Friday at its highest level since October 2020, spiking by almost 80% since Wednesday.
A Forbes poll of 50 influential individuals on Wall Street, including billionaire investors, big-time money managers and economists, found two-thirds of respondents don’t support Trump’s economic policies during his second term, with more than 70% noting his economic policy rollout has not been effective.
“This is the biggest policy mistake in 95 years,” Jeremy Siegel, a professor at University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business, Trump’s alma mater, told CNBC on Friday.

No one, literally no one, from the president to this columnist, expected to see 228,000 jobs added by the American job market last month.
The news had been solely fixated – and we were all literally and figuratively shaking in our boots – regarding the Trump tariffs and the frightening effect on the stock market, not to mention all financial markets worldwide. After all, we’d have to go back to that horrible day – Back Monday, October 19, 1987 – when the market, in the biggest one-day percentage hit in history, lost 23% of its wealth, amounting to$1.7 trillion. Before that? The Crash of 1929.
Needless to say, those of us who remember 1987 are trembling, and were expecting a frightful jobs report. But creating 228 ,000 jobs is good and is far better than expected. So are we OK? Let me give you three caveats and then let’s revisit the question.
First, all the job losses we feared are not in those numbers. Much of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ data are compiled earlier in the month, the effect showing up in subsequent months.
Second, many of the draconian firings and layoffs are facing legal challenges, and at this point, it’s impossible to tell who’s coming and who’s going. But don’t bet against further damage. It’s on the way, without doubt.
Third, Thursday’s stock market record debacle of a 1,700-point loss of more than $3 trillion didn’t stay a record for long. As I write this at end of business Friday, we just absorbed a 2,231-point hit, finishing a two-day drubbing of nearly 4,000 points. All the beautiful work of the last four years is, for the most part, gone
So I ask again: Are we OK? I think not.
The job market’s numbers for January and February were revised downward to 111,000 and 117,000, and with March liable to be revised next month, we’re not on solid ground.
Job growth was not widespread or evenly distributed, as it was in the previous four years. Health care (+54K), social assistance (+24K), retail (+24K), and transportation and warehousing (+23K) did well. All other sectors reported disappointing results. This follows the best 4-year stretch in history.
Bottom line: the volcano is rumbling and it will erupt.
When? It’s already begun and April’s prospects – and beyond – are anywhere from gloom to doom. I’d rather write otherwise, but I can’t."

Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: Asking Rents Mostly Unchanged Year-over-year
Brief excerpt: Another monthly update on rents.

Tracking rents is important for understanding the dynamics of the housing market.  Slower household formation and increased supply (more multi-family completions) has kept asking rents under pressure. ...

Apartment List: Asking Rent Growth -0.4% Year-over-year ...On the supply side of the rental market, our national vacancy index now sits at 6.9 percent, the highest reading in the history of that monthly data series, which goes back to the start of 2017. After a historic tightening in 2021, multifamily occupancy has been slowly but consistently easing for over three years amid an influx of new inventory. 2024 saw the most new apartment completions since the mid-1980s, and with 750 thousand units still in the construction pipeline, the supply boom has runway to continue this year.Realtor.com: 19th Consecutive Month with Year-over-year Decline in RentsThe median asking rent across the 50 largest metropolitan areas in the United States fell again in February, to $1,691. This marks 19 months in a row in which rent has fallen year over year, this time by 0.9% from February 2024. This is much more in the article.

86,2025-04-04,"Blanca Castro puts on a builder's helmet before opening the door to her kitchen. Inside it, the ceiling has a large hole that is dripping water and it looks as if it could collapse at any moment.
Because the kitchen is unusable, Blanca has to wash her dishes in the bathtub, and she has improvised a cooking area with a gas camping stove in a corner of her living room.
Many of her fellow tenants in this apartment block near Madrid's Atocha railway station have similar problems. They say the company that owns the building has stopped responding to requests for basic maintenance in recent months, since informing them that it will not renew their rental contracts.
""The current rental bubble is encouraging a lot of big owners to do what they are doing here,"" says Blanca. ""Which is to get rid of the current tenants who have been here a long time, in order to have short-term tourist flats, or simply to hike up the rent.""
Blanca and her fellow tenants have vowed to stay in the building despite what they see as efforts to push them out by the owners, who were not available for comment for this article.
The tenancy contracts last five years, during which time rent is fixed, but this area of central Madrid has seen housing costs soar in recent years.
""For another home like this [in this area], I'd have to pay double or more what I'm paying now,"" says Blanca. ""It's not viable.""
She and her neighbours are among millions of Spaniards who are suffering the consequences of a housing crisis caused by spiralling rental costs.
While salaries have increased by around 20% over the past decade, the average rental in Spain has doubled during the same period. There has been an 11% increase over the last year alone, according to figures provided by property portal Idealista, and housing has become Spaniards' biggest worry.
It's also generating anger, with Spaniards taking to the streets to demand action from the authorities to make housing more affordable. On Saturday, 5 April thousands of people protested in Madrid and dozens of other cities.
A report by Spain's central bank found that nearly 40% of families who rent now spend more than 40% of their income on their accommodation.
""The current problem is a huge imbalance between supply and demand,"" says Juan Villén, of Idealista. ""Demand is very good, the economy is growing a lot, but supply is dwindling very fast.""
Mr Villén offers the example of Barcelona, where rental increases have become notorious. Whereas nine families were competing to rent each property in the city five years ago, that number has risen to 54. Rental costs during that time have increased by 60%, he adds.
""We need to build more properties,"" says Mr Villén. ""And on the rental side we need more people willing to rent their properties, or willing to buy properties, refurbish them and put them on the rental market.""
The central government has described the situation as ""a social emergency"" and agrees that a lack of supply is driving the crisis. Last year, the Housing Ministry estimated that the country needs between 600,000 and one million new homes over the next four years in order to meet demand.
This need for more housing has been pushed up in part by the arrival of immigrants who have joined the workforce and are helping drive Spain's economic growth. The ministry also pointed to a lack of social housing, which at 3.4% of total supply, is among the lowest in Europe.
In 2007, at the height of a property-ownership bubble, more than 600,000 homes were built in Spain. But high building costs, lack of available land and a shortage of manpower have all been factors in restricting construction in recent years, with just under 100,000 homes completed in 2024.
The government has taken measures to incentivise construction, apportioning land for the building of affordable homes, while trying to ensure that public housing does not end up in the private market, which has been a problem in the past.
But the Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has also expressed a willingness to intervene in the market in order to bring rental prices under control.
At a recent event to mark the opening of 218 low-rent flats in the southern city of Seville, he declared that Spaniards ""want us to act, they want the housing market to operate according to the law of reason, of social justice, not the law of the jungle; they want to ensure that vulture funds and speculators are not doing whatever they like"".
The central government and a number of local administrations have identified short-term tourist accommodation as part of the problem. Last year, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands and several cities on the mainland saw protests by locals against surging tourist numbers, with their impact on rental costs the main complaint.
Several city halls have responded by announcing plans to restrict the granting of tourist-flat permits, while Barcelona is going further, revoking the licences of all of the city's 10,000 or so registered short-term apartments by 2028.
The Sánchez government has also pushed through parliament a housing law, which includes a cap on rentals in so-called ""high-tension"" areas where prices are climbing out of control. Political resistance has meant that the legislation is so far only being implemented in the northern regions of the Basque Country, Navarre and Catalonia, and its success is open to debate.
The Socialist-led regional and central governments have pointed to a 3.7% drop in rental costs in ""high-tension"" areas of Catalonia since the cap's introduction there a year ago, with Barcelona seeing a decrease of 6.4%.
However, critics warn that the rental cap has spooked owners and caused thousands of properties to be withdrawn from the market.
""On the supply side, the problem is that all measures taken by the local or national governments are going against landlords,"" says Mr Villén. ""Even people that were doing build-to-rent new properties have been selling their properties because they don't want to get into the rental market.""
Another initiative proposed by the central government which has stirred up debate is a tax of up to 100% on properties bought by non-residents from outside the EU, on the grounds that such homes are often barely inhabited. This is a measure that, if rolled out, would heavily affect British buyers.
The conservative opposition has accused the government of being too heavy-handed with its approach. However, as public anger builds over this issue, there are many others who would like the country's leaders to act much more stridently.
Gonzalo Álvarez, of the Sindicato de Inquilinas e Inquilinos, an organisation that campaigns for tenants' rights, agrees that a shortage of available homes is a problem, but insists that building more is not the answer.
""There is a lack of housing because homes are being hijacked - on the one hand tourist flats, and on the other hand all the empty flats belonging to vulture funds and the banks,"" he says. ""So there's no need to build more, it's not necessary. But the housing we have has been hijacked.""
His organisation wants the government to impose drastic mandatory reductions in rent on owners and is threatening to orchestrate a nationwide strike by tenants that would see participants refuse to pay their rent.
""The [central and local] governments are not setting any limits,"" says Mr Álvarez. ""So who is going to? We will have to do it.""

90,2025-04-04,"NVIDIA's RTX 5000 GPUs have been hard to come by since launch, but Amazon has made a move to get cards into your hands.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

It's no secret that NVIDIA has struggled to keep its latest RTX 50-series GPUs on shelves ever since the first Blackwell cards launched in January 2025.
The struggle is borne from a combination of NVIDIA's own manufacturing schedule and general output (or lack thereof), high demand from regular consumers, and scalpers buying up available stock to resell at a higher price.
Amazon, usually one of the first stops when checking for available RTX 5000 GPUs, has implemented a new measure to combat scalping.
First spotted by AndroidHeadlines, most NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs sold directly from Amazon are now locked behind a Prime subscription requirement.
👉 Where to buy NVIDIA RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 GPUs
While you can still buy directly from any third-party retailers without a Prime subscription — usually at a higher price than Amazon would sell at — you'll now see a button suggesting you join Prime rather than the regular buy button if you aren't already a member.

Amazon always wants to drive Prime subscriptions any way it can; I'm no huge fan of Amazon, but I admit it's a smart move from a business standpoint.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
What about for regular consumers? Amazon's main goal is to combat quick scalping, but it's essentially asking regular buyers to pay it a subscription premium to participate.
Scalpers have been having a grand old time buying up stock immediately just to relist at a higher price.
👉 Where to buy RTX 5070 Ti GPUs
This has led to shortages and high-priced cards sitting around, unsold, teasing those of us who don't want to pay the scalper tax on top of an inflated MSRP.
Digging a bit deeper into current RTX 50-series stock levels at Amazon, it looks like the move is working so far.
I put together this list of NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPUs currently available at Amazon exclusively to Prime members.
I don't doubt that more of NVIDIA's RTX 50-series GPUs will fall under the Prime requirement as stock comes in, but for now that's what I could find.
Interestingly, it doesn't look like all RTX 50-series GPUs sold directly from Amazon have the Prime requirement.
PNY's RTX 5070 is listed at $699.99 and can be purchased by non-Prime subscribers.
I'm expecting the same treatment to come to AMD's Radeon RX 9000 GPUs. I tried looking for a listing with the same Prime exclusivity, but the scarce options make it difficult.
If you haven't shopped online in the last two decades, Amazon Prime is a subscription-based membership service.
It has millions of members, and it comes with several major perks that make it worth the $14.99/month or $139/year subscription fee.
Subscribers get same-day, one-day, and two-day free shipping as applicable, there are exclusive deals and early access promotions, and you get access to Amazon Prime Video, Amazon Music, Amazon Photos, Amazon Prime Gaming, and Amazon Prime Reading.
You can add exclusive access to the latest GPUs to that list.
Amazon Prime subscriptions come with a 30-day free trial, and I don't see anything that suggests you can't use the free trial to pick up a new GPU and cancel before you're billed.
Amazon Prime Membership | Free w/ 30-day trial or $14.99/month
To get started with Amazon Prime and take advantage of all the benefits, you can sign up with your free 30-day trial or subscribe for $14.99/month. There are options for annual payers, students, and income-verified customers.

Stock market tumbles. All it takes is a glance at the screen to change the mood.
“Oh, sh--. OK.”
That was RH CEO Gary Friedman’s real-time reaction during an April 3 CNBC interview as he watched his company's stock plunge live during a quarterly earnings call, moments after the White House announced a new round of tariffs. RH, also known as Restoration Hardware, is a luxury furniture retailer heavily dependent on a supply chain stretching from Asia to America. Friedman's expletive was likely echoed in countless boardrooms throughout the day. Still, in the days to come, his expletive will be repeated in millions of family rooms across the country as the Dow experienced its biggest wipeout since 2020.
Whether buying furniture, planning retirement, or just filling your gas tank, uncertainty doesn’t just shake market numbers—it rattles confidence. Yes, it is about money, but ultimately it is about emotion. And that, perhaps more than stock prices or interest rates, shapes behavior. The field of psychology suggests that when feeling fear, people typically pursue one of three options: fight, flight, or freeze.
Many of us are watching our 401(k) potentially melt down to a 301(k). While you may be counting lost dollars, which generation you are a part of may also influence how the stock plunge will affect your perception of what is happening and, ultimately, your behavior.
A generation is not simply an age. Shared experiences and memories formed in late adolescence and early adulthood best characterize a generation. From wars to recessions to even the price of eggs or gas at the pump, each generation has its own memories of crises, politics, economic upturns and downturns, and storylines in its heads about how events unfolded and how they were resolved.
These generational experiences serve as a lens through which different cohorts will view, interpret, and respond to the tariff-induced economic shock. From Gen Z to the Silent Generation, the impact and reaction to this uncertainty will not be the same. However, the shared anxiety and, for many, fear about what comes next will be universal.
For Gen Z—those just entering the workforce and taking their first financial steps—today’s market shock is not simply a headline; it’s a formative experience. Gen Z doesn’t just watch the news; they live it. With a thumb swipe, they are immersed in fear-laced tweets, memes, and TikToks, turning social media into an anxiety amplifier.
Economic uncertainty spreads across social platforms like an emotional wildfire. Even those not directly affected may feel the contagion of uncertainty, leading to delayed decisions—putting off purchases or embracing short-term thinking over long-term planning. The pandemic left young adults skeptical of traditional career paths and job security. Many Gen Zers view a full-time job with a side hustle not as optional but essential—an economic Plan B in an unpredictable world.
If current uncertainty persists, this generation could mirror their great-grandparents—the WWII generation—who emerged from the Great Depression as frugal, resilient, and determined. Whether Gen Z becomes the next “great generation” will depend on their adaptability and how well we all support their transition into confident economic adulthood.
Millennials—now in their 30s and 40s—have weathered economic storm after storm: the Great Recession, a global pandemic, and inflation. These crises haven’t just shaped their finances—they’ve shaped their worldview. For many, financial systems, public institutions, employers, and traditional life stages have become as steadfast as sandcastles on a beach.
Much like Gen Z, millennials are not only experiencing bad news—they are also sharing it, absorbing it, and interpreting it as personal financial warning signs. This generation may be more inclined to postpone significant life milestones—such as homeownership, starting a family, having children, or switching careers.
With employers increasingly perceived as unreliable, millennials often maintain side hustles or gig work not just for extra income but as a hedge against instability. This mentality, while pragmatic, may also lead to early burnout as they enter midlife.
Gen X—midlife professionals with careers, mortgages, children, and aging parents—is often described as the sandwich generation. However, increasing economic instability will likely make them feel more like a grill-pressed panini than a simple sandwich. Gen Xers in their late 40s to 50s act as the financial ""shock absorbers"" of their families, responsible for everyone and everything.
Tariffs that increase the price of goods or introduce volatility into retirement accounts aren’t just inconvenient—they’re stress multipliers. They may trigger belt-tightening across household budgets, delay home renovations or college savings plans, and even lead to revised retirement dreams. Many Gen Xers have lived through economic storms before and will respond not with panic (at least not on the surface) but with quiet triage—adjusting budgets, absorbing shocks, and adapting to whatever the new economic normal may become.
But under the surface, this generation is carrying a heavy load. Research from Springer Nature indicates that overall well-being hits a low trough in middle age. Economic uncertainty will only deepen that self-assessment of how life is going, which may be reflected not just in spending but also in workplace engagement and productivity.
For younger boomers in their early 60s, inching toward or entering retirement, tariff-induced market dips feel uncomfortably familiar. Many still carry the memories and portfolio scars of the dot.com bust in the late 1990s, the Great Recession in 2008, and the rapid loss of wealth that came with both events.
Retirement, so close for many in this cohort, may suddenly feel too risky. Many may choose to extend their full-time work life just when hoping for a new chapter of full-time leisure. For younger boomers, it’s not just about money—it's about the loss of certainty just when there is less time to adjust and adapt.
Older retirees—leading-edge baby boomers and the Silent Generation—may seem financially stable due to pensions and other benefits, but they are not immune to the emotional effects of economic turbulence. Many live on fixed incomes, and rising prices or portfolio declines can trigger difficult decisions.
Though they’ve weathered wars, recessions, and inflation before, that history doesn’t always bring comfort. It may bring a deeper awareness of risk. For this generation, confidence and control matter more than portfolio growth. Already, many are not spending as much as they could to enjoy their later years, The Wall Street Journal reported. They may now respond to economic shocks by spending even less out of fear of outliving their savings.
Heightened economic anxiety may also delay the great wealth transfer. For instance, numerous older boomers and Silent Generation families have been giving while living; for example, helping children and grandchildren with home purchases, educational expenses, and even memory-making family vacations. Given the current volatility, the next generation may have to wait.
Uncertainty creates anxiety in every generation. Tariffs may be the trigger, but the resulting emotion creates a wave of uncertainty and fear of what comes next. This anxiety expresses itself differently—on social media, in delayed spending, in second-guessing retirement plans, and in postponed wealth transfers.
As RH's CEO put it bluntly, all it takes is a glance at the screen to change the mood. The real challenge isn't just navigating the numbers—it's managing the profoundly human response to uncertainty, one generation at a time."

Call of Duty Season 3 is live in Black Ops 6, bringing brand-new maps, more game modes, and more guns to unlock in the battle pass. Season 3 completely shakes up the weapon meta, so here we recommend the best weapon builds to try for your next match of multiplayer.
Season 3 adds plenty of nostalgic weapons from Modern Warfare 2019, such as the Kilo 141, CR-56 AMAX, Grau 5.56, and the HDR. All of these weapons look and feel great to use, so there is no shortage of great choices for mid-to-long-range options in Black Ops 6.
The Season 3 patch notes included nerfs for previously popular weapons like the Jackal PDW, and added buffs to make several less viable weapons more popular, including many semi-auto guns.
Recommended weapon builds can be found below, but if you're looking for more details about the new season, make sure to check out all the highlights for Season 3 of Black Ops 6.
We also have a guide for recommended Black Ops 6 weapon builds to use in Warzone for Season 3.

Originally from Modern Warfare 2019, the fan-favorite Kilo 141 assault rifle returns with Season 3. Currently, this is one of the best guns in the game. It has a fast fire rate and very minimal recoil, making it powerful but also really easy to handle. Here's how you unlock the Kilo 141 in Season 3.
The Swat 5.56 marksman rifle hasn't really been a popular choice for multiplayer, but Season 3's battle pass adds a Grau conversion kit attachment that transforms this underperforming marksman rifle into the fully-auto Grau 5.56 assault rifle from Modern Warfare 2019. With this conversion kit, the gun has a very fast time-to-kill and less recoil.
You can add a suppressor and swap to the Infiltrator stock for a faster stealth build, but the Grau conversion will still have some of the Swat's kick. This build offers the most minimal recoil for optimal accuracy.
Again, this build uses the Grau conversion kit, which is unlocked in the free tiers of the battle pass on page 5.
The CR-56 AMAX assault rifle returns to Call of Duty, and just like the Modern Warfare 2019 version, this gun hits like a truck. It still has a slower fire rate and a bit more recoil than the Kilo 141, but it can be a very rewarding and powerful assault rifle to use. The recommended attachments will help reduce some of the weapon's kick and speed up the fire rate.
This build uses the Monolithic Suppressor, which is unlocked in the free tiers of the battle pass on page 7. You can also use the standard suppressor on this build until you can unlock the Monolithic Suppressor in the pass.
If you want to turn this into a Gunfight build, you can also add an optic, the Light stock, and Recoil Springs fire mod to get even more out of the CR-56 AMAX.

The AS-VAL assault rifle is another great choice. This weapon got buffs in Season 3 to improve the gun's maximum range and increase the movement speeds. The recommended attachments will help reduce the gun's recoil and boost the ammo count.
Season 2's Cypher 091 assault rifle is still a solid choice for multiplayer. The recommended attachments will help boost the gun's bullet velocity and damage range to help its performance in longer range engagements.
Thanks to Season 3's nerf to the Jackal PDW, the KSV submachine gun is now one of the best choices for close-range combat in Season 3. The recommended attachments will help with recoil control and mobility.
Another solid choice for close-range combat is the C9 submachine gun. The recommended attachments will help with recoil and improve the gun's damage range and bullet velocity. If you want extra ammo, you can always replace the stock with an Extended Mag attachment.
Originally from Modern Warfare 2019, the HDR sniper rifle returns in Season 3. This is a heavy, one-shot sniper rifle, and the recommended attachments will help you improve mobility and provide a better optic choice for multiplayer.
This is a good choice for using the Gunfight Wildcard and loading this gun down with attachments. Precision Foregrip underbarrel, Quickdraw Grip rear grip, and Rapid Fire.

94,2025-04-04,"The move comes in response to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump.
Nissan has ceased on new orders from the US for two of its Infiniti SUV models, the QX50 and QX55, produced at the COMPAS plant in Mexico, reported Reuters.
The move comes in response to tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump and marks a reduction in Nissan’s operations at its COMPAS plant in Mexico, which it operates jointly with Mercedes-Benz.

                        The gold standard of business intelligence.

While production of the two Infiniti SUV models will continue for markets outside the US, Nissan did not specify how much of the output is allocated to international sales.
A Japan-based Nissan spokesperson was cited by the news agency as saying that the vehicles are also shipped to markets including the Middle East and Canada.
The Japanese automaker, however, plans to maintain two production shifts for the Rogue SUV at its Smyrna plant in Tennessee. This reverses an announcement made in January 2025, which indicated that the company would discontinue one of the shifts in April.
The company, which has been facing challenges in the US market due to an outdated product lineup and a scarcity of hybrid vehicles, is particularly affected by the new tariffs as it exports more vehicles to the US from Mexico than any other Japanese manufacturer.
In efforts to streamline operations and reduce costs, Nissan Motor disclosed plans last month to simplify its management structure, which will see a 21% decrease in top executive positions, from 42 to 33, starting from the 2025 fiscal year.
At that time, Nissan said: “This is also part of Nissan’s commitment to improving decision-making efficiency by simplifying organizational layers and expanding the span of control. These changes are designed to empower regions and establish clear roles and responsibilities within the organisation.”
