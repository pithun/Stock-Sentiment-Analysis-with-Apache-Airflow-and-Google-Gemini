The British carmaker says it won’t ship to the US during the month of April.
by  Wes Davis
Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) says it’s delaying shipments to the US this month while it works out how it will deal with the wide-ranging tariffs President Donald Trump announced this week, according to The Guardian.
“As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are taking some short-term actions, including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid- to longer-term plans,” JLR told The Guardian. The automaker is responding to a 25 percent Trump-ordered tariff on imported vehicles that went into effect Thursday and could add $5,000 to $10,000 or more to the price of a new car in the US.
JLR said this week that its business remains “resilient,” but those living in the town where its cars are made weren’t optimistic, with one telling The Guardian that the tariffs could lead to job losses. About a quarter of the 400,000 vehicles JLR sells every year go to US buyers, as The Sunday Times notes in its own story about the pause this morning. It’s thought that the automaker has enough existing US stock to last about two months, and it would take about 21 days for more to come once shipments resume, the Times writes.
JLR isn’t alone in its concerns. Earlier this week, Nintendo blamed Trump’s new tariffs as it delayed US preorders of the Switch 2, originally scheduled to start on April 9th. In the wake of the tariffs announcement, the US Stock market lost $6.6 trillion in two days — a record, according to The Wall Street Journal — and industries are bracing for negative impacts to the cost and availability of just about everything, including the high-powered GPUs used by AI companies, gadgets of all types, and even board games

British luxury automaker Jaguar Land Rover is halting shipments of its cars to the US this month as it navigates President Donald Trump's new 25% tariff on imported automobiles.

        In a statement Saturday, a spokesperson for the company told Business Insider: ""The USA is an important market for JLR's luxury brands. As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are enacting our short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid- to longer-term plans.""
    

        The Times of London first reported the pause.
    

        JLR said in a separate statement on Wednesday that its brands were ""accustomed to changing market conditions"" and that it was prioritizing ""delivering for our clients around the world and addressing these new US trading terms.""
    

        The company, which employs almost 40,000 people across the world, is one of the UK's most iconic carmakers and has long been popular with celebrities in both Britain and the US. JLR's retail sales were up 21.7% to just over 430,000 vehicles in the fiscal year 2023 to 2024, including roughly 95,000 in North America, according to its annual report.
    

        JLR's decision to pause US shipments follows a massive global stock market sell-off sparked by Trump's slew of new tariffs, which he announced this week.
    

        A baseline 10% tariff on trading partners came into effect on Saturday, while higher levies on some nations are set to begin on April 9.
    

        While Trump sees the duties as a means of bolstering domestic investment and ""supercharging"" the economy, many analysts are questioning the potential economic consequences.

A trader works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, on April 4, 2025. Markets extended a global selloff on April 4 as countries around the world reeled from President Donald Trump's tariffs.
Reporter
The U.S. and global stock markets have been hit hard since President Donald Trump announced his latest tariffs on April 2. The so-called “Liberation Day” saw the introduction of blanket 10% tariffs on all imported goods, and additional import taxes placed on 60 other countries.
In the worst week for U.S. stocks since the markets crashed in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, Dow Jones closed on Friday 2,000 points down, the S&P Index plunged 6%, and Nasdaq dipped almost 6%.

The volatility of the market has risen significantly, causing concern from investors and businesses alike, and sparking fresh fears that the U.S. may be heading into a recession.

There has also been a surge in concerns being voiced by people worried about the impact on their 401(k), as many have noticed a dip in their investments. 
Here’s what you need to know about how the economic turmoil resulting from Trump’s tariffs will affect your 401(k) and what you should do moving forward.
A 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement plan where a person has the option to make contributions that are deducted from their paycheck. In some cases, the company will match your contributions up to a certain percentage of your salary.
The value of 401(k) accounts is closely tied to fluctuations in the stock markets, as the portfolio allows you to invest in assets which are directly tied to the market’s performance. As such, when the stock market fluctuates, so too does a 401(k). With a 401(k), you carry all the risk because the investment decisions are yours.
With such extreme dips in the stock market, some Americans are seeing their retirement savings take an intense hit.
During an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, April 6, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was asked about the market turmoil and the concerns regarding retirement savings.
Host Kristen Welker said: “More than 160 million Americans are invested in the market. Many of them have spent their lives saving for their retirement. What is your message to Americans who want to retire right now and who've just seen their lifetime savings drop significantly?”
Responding to the question, Bessent remarked that he thinks it's a “false narrative,” and suggested that people maintain a “long-term view.”
“Americans who want to retire right now, Americans who have put away for years in their savings accounts, I think they don't look at the day-to-day fluctuations of what's happening. And you know, in fact, most Americans don't have everything in the market,” said Bessent. “Most Americans in a 401(k) have what's called a '60/40 account.' 60/40 accounts are down 5 or 6% on the year. People have a long-term view. They have a program that the reason the stock market is considered a good investment is because it's a long-term investment. If you look day-to-day, week-to-week, it's very risky. Over the long term, it's a good investment.”
Bessent's remarks mirror those made by Trump. On April 3, when aboard Air Force One, Trump was asked by a reporter about the rising concerns among Americans and whether he has checked his own 401(k) since his tariff announcements stunned the stock market.
Trump said: “I haven’t checked my 401(k).” The President also doubled down on his belief that though the markets look bad now, his tariffs will ultimately be a good thing for the economy. “I think our markets are going to boom; we’ve got to give it a little chance,” he said.
The President once again shared his optimism about the economy in an update he posted on his social media platform, Truth Social, on Saturday, April 5. “This is an economic revolution, and we will win. Hang tough, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will Make America Great Again,” he said.

However, experts have their concerns.
Teresa Fort, associate professor of business administration at Dartmouth, says: “The U.S. market has outperformed everywhere for the last couple of decades, but I don’t know if it’s clear that this is going to continue… the entire world economic order has been shifted, and people are going to need to rethink what [their] optimal allocations should be.”
Brad Clark, founder and CEO of Solomon Financial, says that this is not the time to panic and take your money out of savings. “It’s scary,” he admits, but the response to fear, in his professional opinion, is to stay the course—especially if you are a younger investor preparing for future retirement.
“When you're flying somewhere and you're in the worst turbulence you've ever been in, all you can think is, ‘I've just got to get off this plane,’” says Clark. “But the plane was built to handle this. That's kind of like your portfolio.”
For people two or three years from retirement, Clark says their portfolios should already be less risky, and they should not have full market exposure to their investments.
However, for those who are still 10 or more years away from retirement, there could be positives to note. “What a great buying opportunity,” Clark argues. “This is how the Warren Buffetts of the world make money. Greedy when everyone else is fearful, and fearful when everyone else is greedy.”
Clark’s advice to those people—who are a decade or more away from retirement— is to “continue to invest like you’ve always invested,” and he is confident that this will pay off in the long run.
In a column for the Washington Post, personal finance columnist and author Michelle Singletary echoed this sentiment. “If you’re in your 20s, 30s, or early 40s, don’t let what’s happening now scare you away from the stock market. Keep investing,” she said.
Read More: How to Prepare For the New Social Security ID Policy Ahead of Its Initiation in April
Laurence Kotlikoff, professor of economics at Boston University, takes a more cautious approach for people of all ages. 
He recommends not investing in anything risky now, instead starting back from a safe investment position and eventually building your investment portfolio back into something more risky. By starting conservatively and building up, Kotlikoff says that investors can save themselves from pain later on. 
“There’s no reason to believe that the market will reverse itself,” he says. “Leave only in the market what you can afford to lose and don’t spend outside of it.”
He also recommends people consider doing what he and his wife did soon after Trump’s Inauguration Day. In preparation of potential market fluctuations, they built a TIPS ladder, which is a portfolio of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. 
TIPS are U.S. government bonds that adjust for inflation, ensuring that the bond’s principal increases with inflation and decreases with deflation.
“It's a combination of spending and investing behavior that is called ‘upside investing’ that leads you just to have upside risks,” Kotlikoff says. “You're losing that downside because you're never spending out of anything that's risky, you’re just spending out of this TIPS ladder.”
Fort echoes Kotlikoff’s caution, noting that while some economists are saying to stay the course as usual, these are not usual times, and she thinks that it is likely that the markets are only going to dip further. For her own mother, who relies on her 401k, Fort has reduced her exposure to the market as much as possible. 
“This is a fundamental shift in the world order,” Fort emphasizes once more. “If you are close to retirement age, you’ll want to look for the safest assets if you cannot afford another 20% to 30% decline in the market.”
Overall, it's worth noting that expert advice varies depending on the age of the person with the 401(k) and what stage they're at in their working lives. For example, Fort did not take the same measures for her own financial portfolio as she did for her mother's, since she is younger and has more time until retirement. Across the board, expert guidance tells us not to panic and not to make any rash financial decisions.

3,2025-04-05,"On a quick drive around the small Ohio town of Delta, you can spot nearly as many Trump flags as American stars-and-stripes banners.
And at the petrol station near the Ohio Turnpike, the pumps bear relics of the last administration, with slogans slamming Trump's predecessor: ""Whoever voted for Biden owes me gas money!""
This is Trump country - the Republican ticket easily won here in November's presidential election by a margin of almost two-to-one. And while the markets are in turmoil following Trump's unveiling of expansive global tariffs this week, plenty of people in Delta and hundreds of Midwestern towns like it still back the president's plans.
Those plans, to impose tariffs of between 10% and 50% on almost every country, have upended global trade and led to warnings that prices could soon rise for American consumers. Trump, meanwhile, has said the move will address unfair trade imbalances, boost US industry and raise revenue.
For some in Delta, the president's argument about fairness resonates.
""I don't want people in other countries to suffer, I really don't,"" said Mary Miller, manager of the Delta Candy Emporium, which sits in the middle of the village's Main Street. ""But we need to have an even playing field.""
Miller, a three-time Trump voter, believes other countries haven't played fair on trade. And like many here, she prefers to buy American-made goods.
As she watches over her stock of multi-coloured confectioneries, many of them made in the US, and weighs up how they might be impacted by fresh import taxes, she recalls how decades ago she heard that one of her favourite brands was moving its factories abroad. She hasn't bought another pair of Levi's jeans since.
Miller is unfazed by the possibility of price increases, which many economists say these new tariffs will bring.
""Sometimes you have to walk through fire to get to the other side,"" she said.
""If tariffs bring companies and business back to hard-working American people like the ones who live here, then it's worth it.""
These sentiments are common in Delta, a village of around 3,300 people less than 100 miles (160km) south of Detroit, even as other Midwestern towns brace for sharp shocks.
The automotive industry, with its complicated global supply chains, seems particularly vulnerable to the impact of major new tariffs, with companies in Michigan to the north and Indiana to the west already announcing factory shutdowns and job cuts.
But on the outskirts of Delta, there is a cluster of steel businesses that have been here since the 1990s and which may be better placed in a new era of American protectionism.
One of these businesses, North Star BlueScope, has urged Trump to expand tariffs on steel and aluminium. At the same time, however, it has asked for an exemption for the raw materials it needs, such as scrap metal.
North Star BlueScope did not respond to interview requests, but in a back room at the nearby Barn Restaurant, a few local steelworkers who had just finished the night shift were drinking beers together early on Friday morning.
The workers, who asked not to be named, mostly laughed and shrugged when asked about the sweeping new tariffs that were announced by Trump at the White House on Wednesday.
It was a pretty clear indication that this economic news is unlikely to ruin their weekend.
Outside the restaurant, some Delta locals considered the possible upsides of these import taxes.
""Nobody's frantic. We're not going to lose any sleep over it,"" said Gene Burkholder, who has a decades-long career in the agriculture industry.
Although he owns some stocks, Mr Burkholder said they were long-term investments and he was not obsessing over the sharp drops in the two days following the president's announcement.
""If you have some spare cash, maybe it's a good time to buy some shares while they're cheap,"" he said.
A couple of booths over, as she finished eating breakfast with her son Rob, Louise Gilson said - quietly - that she did not really trust the president.
But Gilson, along with many people here, said she wanted to see action. She wholeheartedly agreed when another diner commented: ""Trump may be wrong, but at least he's trying.""
""The other people wouldn't have done squat,"" she said, referring to the Democratic Party.
The Gilsons agreed that the big local industrial employers have generally been good neighbours, contributing to the local economy, charities and the wider community, even as they have seen some less desirable effects of industrial development and worry about unequal sharing of the economic pie.
And as they recounted Delta's history, they described a gradual erosion in quality of life that they believe has made many people willing to roll the dice even when economists say Trump's tariff plan comes with stark risks.
""It was a good little town to grow up in,"" Rob Gilson recalled. But he said it now seemed less safe and friendly than when he was growing up in the 60s and 70s. 
""It seems like the heart of America is gone,"" he said.
Delta, Louise Gilson added, ""is the kind of place where 25% or 30% of the people are struggling with their demons"".
And while these issues have little to do with tariffs, the challenges faced by people in towns like Delta may go some way to explaining why many are willing to give President Trump the benefit of the doubt, even as markets plunge on faraway Wall Street.

Mike's Hot Honey, ubiquitous in US grocery stores and pizza chains, technically got its start in Brazil.

        It was 2003. Mike Kurtz was a junior in college, completing a semester in Salvador. After a national park trip, Kurtz and his friends stopped at a pizzeria for lunch. The shop had an unusual condiment, one he hadn't seen before: honey infused with whole chili peppers.
    

        When Kurtz returned to America, he spent his senior year tinkering with his own version, a more homogenous mixture ""with a really nice level of heat that could cut through a slice of pizza,"" Kurtz, now 43, told Business Insider.
    

        He started making jars of hot honey for friends and family as a hobby. Kurtz loved to cook, often making homemade pizzas to accompany his honey creations.
    

        It took six years for Mike's Hot Honey to leave the hobby phase. Kurtz spent years working in the music industry and later, as a travel blogger. Still, the idea of turning his hot honey side hustle into a business stuck: Kurtz finally started selling jars of it at a popular Brooklyn pizzeria in 2010.
    

        In 2025, over 20 years since Kurtz first ate that fateful slice in Brazil, Mike's Hot Honey is projected to make $60 million, earning 60% of its revenue in retail and the rest in food service. Trailblazing the ""swicy"" food trend, the brand recently announced collaborations with KFC, Dunkin', and Heineken, as well as with famed pizzerias like Chicago's Lou Malnati's.
    

        Kurtz shared tips on how to stay committed to an idea, even when life gets busy — or when you worry it's too late to take a career risk.
    

        Kurtz spent his senior year of college at UMass taking frequent trips to New York City. After doing some online research, he was drawn to a unique location: the Hunts Point Produce Market in the Bronx, where many of the city's restaurants get their produce.
    

        Open from 10 p.m. to 10 a.m., the market was the best place to find the widest range of chilies, especially in the mid-aughts, when his college town's options were limited to jalapeos. ""I was just curious, the first time I went there,"" he said.
    

        He found it to be ""like a stock market for produce"" and would go down on weekends with a half gallon of whole milk in his backpack. He'd take sips between taste-testing peppers at the market as a way to clean his palate, then bring bags of peppers back home.
    

        Kurtz tried different infusion techniques in his apartment, drizzling each batch on slices of pizza. He said that a genuine interest in hot honey and pizza made it easy to stay committed to finding a recipe that worked.
    

        Kurtz, who describes himself as a ""generally curious person,"" also found his future employer — and the official starting point of Mike's Hot Honey — by poking around on a now-defunct pizza blog called Slice.
    

        He kept seeing the same handle in the comments section. ""I'm like, who is this guy? He's a serial commenter on every post,"" he said. Kurtz later read a profile of the commenter, Paul Giannone, known as Paulie Gee, who made wood-fired pizzas in his Greenpoint apartment. Later, when Giannone opened his famed Brooklyn pizza restaurant Paulie Gee's, Kurtz followed as a pizza maker, eventually selling his hot honey there.
    

        Right from the beginning, Kurtz received feedback on his idea: he gave away homemade jars as holiday gifts to his loved ones. Some told him the hot honey was really good and could be a business someday, an idea that he didn't pursue at the time.
    

        Nonetheless, knowing people liked his product gave him emotional fuel to persevere. Thatis what pushed him to approach Giannone with his hot honey. It became a central ingredient in the restaurant's ""Hellboy"" slice, now its most popular pie.
    

        Working from the restaurant's open kitchen — what Paulie Gee's staff referred to as the ""pizza theater"" — Kurtz could watch people's reactions as they bit into the Hellboy. Gradually, he started making and selling containers of Mike's Hot Honey from the counter at Paulie Gee's, gaining popularity by word of mouth. Eventually, he found a distributor and sold Mike's Hot Honey to its first retailer, Whole Foods, in 2014.
    

        He said getting early, positive feedback was crucial to his success because it motivated him to continue. ""Don't be afraid to just launch something, as new and rough around the edges as it is,"" Kurtz said. ""It gets a lot easier to make adjustments to an idea than trying to fine-tune something in your own echo chamber.""
    

        At 29, Kurtz's career in music was affected by the 2008 recession. The industry was ""not in a healthy place,"" he said, and he split his time between working at a booking agency and moonlighting as a pizza maker at Paulie Gee's.
    

        Kurtz had a dilemma: he loved making pizza, and he wanted to give his hot honey dream a shot by incorporating it into the restaurant's menu. At the same time, he was almost 30 and had invested nearly his entire career into music supervision. In a tough economic climate, he felt lucky to have his booking agency job.
    

        ""Even young people sort of get it in their head that it's too late for them to switch gears and try something different,"" Kurtz said.
    

        Getting to know Giannone helped him make a decision. At 56, Giannone quit his 30-year IT career to open a restaurant — despite having no formal restaurant experience.
    

        Seeing how the risk paid off for Giannone influenced Kurtz's own leap of faith. Even in the early days of Paulie Gee's, ""you could see he was so happy in the restaurant,"" Kurtz said. ""Witnessing Paulie's journey of opening the pizzeria, that gave me the confidence I needed to really go for it with the honey.""

Babies, homes, retirement, and business ventures — all major moves Americans have told BI they're putting on hold as the US reels from economic uncertainty.

Tariffs are set to raise prices on everything from groceries to cars, and sweeping cuts to federal spending have many concerned about their livelihoods. Federal student loan limbo is also leaving millions wondering how they will pay off their debt.
    

        ""I feel like I just got done building a life out here,"" said a Washington DC 28-year-old who resigned from her government job and may have to move due to finances. ""I was actually trying to own a home.""
    

        Some are even worried about a recession. While the US isn't in one yet, a major indicator of consumer sentiment hit a three-year low in March, and consumer spending was weaker than expected last month. Meanwhile, a closely watched inflation metric has seen its highest jump in a year. Economists have said these conditions are making people less likely to make major purchases and take financial risks.
    

        While some Americans also told BI they support Trump's recent cost-cutting measures and don't plan to make any adjustments to their jobs or savings, six shared stories about holding off on major milestones.
    

        Florence Thompson feels stuck. The 39-year-old wants to buy a home and have a baby, but she's not sure what her future monthly student-loan payments will look like. She said she hopes they'll stay in the low hundreds.
    

        Thompson is enrolled in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments. Trump is taking steps to limit eligibility for the program, which could bar some borrowers from future relief.
    

        Thompson is also on the SAVE plan, created by President Joe Biden to give borrowers more affordable monthly payments. Since July, she and 8 million enrolled borrowers have been stuck in forbearance after SAVE was blocked in court. Thompson has not been able to make payments or earn PSLF credit while the lawsuit plays out. Now, Thompson isn't sure when she will have to add loan payments back into her budget — and how much those payments will be. The Trump administration's recent decision to dismantle the Department of Education has heightened this uncertainty, she said. It's complicating her plans to buy a home and start a family.
    

        ""I have the money to pursue IVF, I have the money to buy a home,"" Thompson said. ""But it's like the sword hanging above your head where you don't know when your monthly costs are going to increase and by how much. It's just a real uncertainty, and I know people are in much more difficult positions than myself. It's just not fair, not right.""
    

        Until she knows what will happen with her student debt, Thompson is conflicted. ""It's really causing me to have to save money rather than spend it on the things that I'd like to spend it on,"" she said.
    

        Ashley Shannon submitted her resignation letter last month. The 28-year-old was an attorney in her second year at the Department of Justice's Federal Bureau of Prisons. She said her job felt meaningful — her work helped combat mass incarceration disproportionately impacting Black and brown people.
    

        But, as news flooded in about the firings of federal probationary workers, Shannon made the tough decision to leave her role.
    

        ""Higher up in the agency, they pretty much told us it's either you leave or you're going to likely get fired and pushed out,"" she said.
    

        The career paths for Black women in private-sector law are more limited than in the federal workforce, and Shannon had been excited to build a career in the public interest. She had been making $100,000 a year and was building her life in Washington DC — hoping to buy her first home soon. Now, Shannon has been unemployed since March 5. If she can't find a job by the end of April, she will have to move back to Chicago to live with her parents.
    

        ""That is a very defeating feeling as a very new attorney,"" she said. ""I would have to move back in with my family, find another job, and pretty much restart my entire life.""
    

        Last fall, Bri O. moved back in with her parents. The 23-year-old works a finance job in Charlotte, North Carolina. She didn't picture spending her young adult years in her childhood home, but said it's her best option to save money.
    

        Bri knew she wanted to live abroad at some point in her life — it's an opportunity to experience new cultures and she has her eyes set on Spain. However, she said Trump's return to the Oval Office has accelerated her timeline: She's now trying to save $50,000 by 2026 so that she can move out of the US, maybe permanently.
    

        As a young, queer woman, Bri said she doesn't feel safe living under the Trump administration, especially if she someday chooses to get married or start a family. The government ""enacting policies against us in the queer community is having an effect on our lives,"" she said.
    

        She said she's sacrificing some of her independence by living with family right now, but it's worth it for her finances. Being at home is allowing her to put the money she would be spending on rent and other expenses into savings for her eventual move.
    

        ""I'd love to stay in the country where all my friends and my family are,"" she said, adding, ""It's disheartening that I'm leaving because of fear.""
    

        Margarita Sdoukos, 49, thought she was going to retire early. She was confident that she and her husband would have a strong enough nest egg to stop working in six years.Due to living below their means, savvy investments, and careful saving habits, the couple felt financially comfortable.
    

        Now, Sdoukos isn't sure she will ever fully retire. The Illinois resident told BI that she and her husband have lost ""tens of thousands"" of dollars in the stock market since Trump took office in January, and they're shifting to safer investments for their 401(k), even if they are less lucrative. She cashed out her teacher's pension and placed it in an IRA due to ""uncertainty in the government."" She's concerned about potential changes to Social Security, and now expects to continue working for as long as possible.
    

        ""We don't even think about retirement right now,"" she said.
    

        Jessica Deseo, 40, has been in the design industry for nearly two decades. She's a California-based, first-generation immigrant and mother who is balancing her own LLC with her role as a 1099 employee for a fellow creative.
    

        With economic policy changing quickly under Trump, Deseo is at a crossroads with her career: go solo with her business or balance her job and freelancing.
    

        ""I'm right in the middle of figuring that out, and it's really, really hard,"" she said.
    

        Deseo said she wants to put energy and money into growing her own business, but it comes with sacrifices. She's worried that potential clients won't have the extra budget to hire her as a freelancer and said that going out completely on her own would be an even bigger financial risk. Right now, she's being cautious about spending and saving as much as she can.
    

        ""You see the economy around you and you're just like, 'Jesus, everyone is getting laid off,""' she said.
    

        Kathy Heller, 67, hoped to move out of her studio apartment in Pennsylvania and buy a new house. However, due to recent changes in the stock market and her fears about the future of Social Security, she said that may no longer be possible.
    

        ""I've been wanting to move for the last couple of years, and I just can't now,"" Heller said. ""Everything's changed.""
    

        Heller, who worked as a legal secretary, ate through some of her retirement savings after her husband became ill. She works nearly full-time as a real estate agent to supplement her monthly Social Security survivor benefits. She said she's had to wait for four hours on the phone to contact a Social Security representative, and she said she's worried about what her finances may look like a few months from now, especially if Social Security is disrupted in any way.
    

        ""My plan is to save $1,000 a month out of my Social Security check, but I live alone,"" Heller said. ""If you don't have savings or a monthly income, you're screwed now.""

Just a few years ago, you only needed to be a ""competent"" software engineer to land a job. Now, you have to be perfect.

        That's according to Evan King and Stefan Mai, cofounders of interview-prep startup Hello Interview. Previously, King worked as a staff engineer for Meta, while Mai has experience as an engineering manager at Amazon and a senior engineering manager at Meta.
    

        ""There is little incentive to pass someone who doesn't get everything entirely correct,"" King and Mai wrote for the The Pragmatic Engineer newsletter. This is the grim reality of what happens when there are so many qualified candidates in the interview pool.
    

        A series of unfortunate circumstances have created the perfect storm for out-of-work engineers, they said. For one, there has only been about a 40% increase in the total number of jobs available since the market hit rock bottom in 2023, and companies are increasingly picky about who they onboard.
    

        And with engineers of all experience levels competing for a reduced number of roles, candidates are increasingly facing interviews that King and Mai said are only becoming harder to clear.
    

        ""While the core interview structure at Big Tech remains largely unchanged, the bar has shifted approximately one standard deviation higher across the board, and performance that would have secured an offer in 2021 might not even clear the screening stage today,"" they wrote.
    

        Engineers in niche specialties are doing better, King and Mai said, with the hiring market seeing an increased demand for those who have knowledge of ""AI infrastructure"" and ""machine learning operations,"" among other things. Those in ""core domains,"" though, which the authors designate as frontend, backend services, and mobile development, are seeing fewer openings.
    

        The challenges aren't all equally punishing, though. King and Mai write that junior engineers, particularly those first entering the market after graduation, face the toughest field of competition.
    

        They spoke to a job seeker who graduated from the Indian Institutes of Technology — which the authors describe as the ""most prestigious computer science university in the country"" — and has been trying to land a position for 6 months, having applied to over 100 companies. The former student hasn't received a single offer.
    

        ""Companies that once maintained robust university hiring programs have dramatically scaled them back, which is concerning because this could create an experience gap that impacts the industry for years to come, and could manifest in a 'missing generation' of engineers,"" they wrote.
    

        As for what junior programmers can do to increase their odds, King and Mai suggested shoring up on the fundamentals.
    

        ""The technical bar for junior roles has risen dramatically, making mastery of fundamental algorithms and data structures essential,"" they wrote. ""Successful junior candidates typically solve 150-200 coding problems across all difficulty levels before interviewing. You must be a stronger coder before anything else.""
    

        Though the competition is severe, it's not impossible to break through, said King and Mai. They wrote that though the interview process has essentially become a ""specialized game,"" candidates do have one advantage — the rules are public, and interviews can be practiced.
    

        ""The process might seem arbitrary, but with proper preparation, it's entirely learnable,"" they said. ""Anyone with sufficient dedication can master these patterns and significantly improve their performance.""
    

        In a follow-up conversation with Business Insider, Mai said the current job market heavily favors the prepared.
    

        ""For those who are able to put in the effort, and willing to put in the effort, I think the market is still one where you can find a job,"" he said. ""If you talk to too many people, you'll encounter a bunch of engineers who've been really, really struggling, but there are plenty of people who are making moves and getting their positions.""

10,2025-04-05,"The US began collecting a 10% ""baseline"" tariff on all imports on Saturday as President Donald Trump urged Americans to ""hang tough"" after market turmoil.
The UK and France are among hundreds of countries impacted and its leaders have said nothing is off the table. While China, which has been hit the hardest by President Trump's tariffs, announced a significant retaliatory response.
All three major stock indexes in the US plunged more than 5% on Friday, with the S&P 500 dropping almost 6%, capping the worst week for the US stock market since 2020.
In Washington DC, New York and other cities thousands gathered to protest against a range of Trump's policies - from the economy to government cuts.
Trump described the market volatility as ""an economic revolution"", which the US ""will win"".
""Hang tough, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic,"" he added in a post on Truth Social.
His policy changes have sent shockwaves through global supply chains.
In the UK, the FTSE 100 fell almost 5% - its steepest in five years, while Asian markets also dropped and exchanges in Germany and France faced similar declines.
Billionaire Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump and responsible for the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), said the US and Europe could move towards a ""zero-tariff situation"", which could create ""a free-trade zone between Europe and North America"".
His comments, made as he travelled to meet government ministers in Italy, came days before the Trump administration introduces tariffs on goods of up to 50% on 9 April to what it calls the ""worst offenders"" for trade imbalances with the US. 
The EU is due to be hit with a 20% levy.
In his first term in office, Trump scorned a proposed free-trade deal with the EU, called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment partnership, but a bubbling trade war was ended after he put threats to impose tariffs on European cars aside in 2018.
British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had a series of calls with world leaders following Trump's tariffs announcement on Wednesday.
In a readout issued after Sir Keir's conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron, Downing Street said the pair ""agreed that a trade war was in nobody's interests but nothing should be off the table"".
Sir Keir and Macron also ""shared their concerns about the global economic and security impact, particularly in South East Asia"".
China, the world's second-largest economy, was hardest hit by Trump's ""reciprocal tariffs"" towards nations he deems unfriendly to America's interest.
On Friday, Beijing announced retaliatory tariffs of 34% on US imports - the same as Washington imposed on imports from China. Beijing also filed a complaint against the new tariffs to the World Trade Organisation.
In a statement a day later, China's foreign ministry urged Washington to ""stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China's economy and trade, and stop undermining the legitimate development rights of the Chinese people"".
In Washington DC and across the US, around 1,200 demonstrations were expected to take place on Saturday, marking the largest single day of protest against President Trump and Musk since the White House announced policy changes to how the US government is led - expanding the power of the executive branch.
The White House is yet to comment on the protests, but Trump was pictured by an AP photographer - excluded from the press pool - with an issue of the New York Post in his hand, open to an article about China.
The impact on trade since tariffs came into place has been palpable.
In the UK, Jaguar Land Rover announced it would ""pause"" all shipments to the US as it works to ""address the new trading terms"".
Critically endangered Galapagos tortoises Abrazzo and Mommy are parents of four hatchlings at Philadelphia Zoo
High winds and heavy rain were expected to continue into Sunday, delaying clean-up efforts. 
The African nation is ""taking advantage"" of the US by not accepting its citizens, says the top US diplomat.
Thousands of protesters gathered for the most visible opposition movement of Trump's second term. 
Peter and Barbie Reynolds have been detained for nine weeks in Afghanistan, where they have lived for 18 years.

President Donald Trump’s tariffs bombshell this week (complete with a levy seemingly aimed at a few thousand penguins on remote Antarctic islands) landed right in the middle of Watches & Wonders, the sprawling Geneva trade show that brings together Rolex, Patek Philippe, TAG Heuer, Cartier and a panoply of other major players in the Swiss luxury watch industry—an industry that has suddenly found itself facing a 31 percent import tax in its biggest and most important market.
In 2024, America accounted for one-sixth of the global Swiss watch market, which is bad news considering the watch industry has already been fighting a significant downturn. Whether the dollar prices on this page remain intact for long is currently anyone’s guess. The senior watch executives WIRED questioned at the show were unwilling to offer any comment on the record, and one big-brand CEO had no idea the tariff announcement was imminent.
Still, while some factories have reportedly been running on half time in recent months, the new watches on display this year offered plenty of new ideas and groundbreaking designs. Here's our pick of the week's new releases.
For an industry which still relies on centuries-old mechanical principles, the luxury watch world’s innovation obsession can seem anachronistic. But the Land-Dweller from Rolex is a genuine flag-in-the-ground moment, dressed up in a funky, integrated-bracelet design that harks back to the 1970s and the brand’s one classic quartz watch of the era, the OysterQuartz.
Calibre 7135, the engine that powers it, replaces the lever escapement—the 270-year-old device that converts mechanical energy into equal pulses that drive the hands—with a new construction Rolex has named “Dynapulse.” All the escapement parts are made from silicon, pivoting at high frequency around a balance staff (the central stem of the hairspring/balance wheel oscillator) laser-etched from a new kind of ceramic.
The advantages in accuracy, shock absorption, and stability will be barely noticeable to most; but the expectation of a long-term roll-out across the production lines of the world’s biggest watchmaker—and the replacement of the most crucial and finicky parts with endlessly replicable silicon components—may well be game-changing, and come stacked with patent applications. Plus, the Land-Dweller, available in steel with a white gold bezel, in rose gold, or in platinum, with sizing options at both 36 mm and 40 mm, means there’s an entirely new family of Rollies for the flippers to fight over and the A-listers to flex. Expect plenty of both. From $13,900
Vacheron Constantin’s “Solaria” ultra-grand complication is, in no small feat, the most complicated wristwatch ever made. It packs in 41 complications—including chiming features, calendar displays, a split-second chronograph, and an array of astronomical indications—that are displayed on both sides of the watch. Overlaid by a star-chart dial, the split-seconds chronograph can even be used to calculate the time it takes for a particular star or constellation to come into view. It took one watchmaker eight years to design the watch, for which Vacheron is taking orders—no price details, but expect it to be to the tune of millions. We’re all in the gutter, after all, but some of us are looking at the stars.
Just as TAG Heuer returns as Formula 1’s timing sponsor, its legendary plastic-cased, battery-powered watch from the 1980s is back back back—now solar-powered, enlarged and upgraded. Now cased in castor-based bioplastic, and with a movement incorporating Citizen’s solar tech (via a Swiss subsidiary), it’s a fun, poppy and thoroughly modern take on the watch that kicked off TAG Heuer’s modern-era success. Find out exactly how they revived this iconic piece here. Steel-cased models with plastic bezels are available to all, while various full-plastic multi-colored editions will appear as limited runs coinciding with different Grand Prix races. From $1,800
Developed from a concept watch announced a few years ago, the Shock Absorber is designed to resist high impacts and g-forces—in a Cambridge University lab, it survived impacts of 10,000 g’s. Cased in IWC’s ceratanium (a ceramic/titanium mixture), it houses the movement—which in this case means a skeletonized tourbillon, a watch complication that increases accuracy by countering the effect of Earth's gravity on the balance wheel and spring—in a cantilevered spring mounting made of bulk metallic glass (BMG), which absorbs shocks without disturbing the mechanism. $210,600
While the Black Bay is Tudor’s dapper (if dive-watch-inspired) generalist wristwatch, the Pelagos is its hardcore sibling, and it just got hardier still. Rated to 1,000 meters in depth, the Ultra is a purist deep-sea diving watch, with an upsized 43-mm case in titanium, enlarged, high-contrast dial markings, and intense luminescence, including minute and hour hands in blue and green lume, respectively, for extra visibility in the depths. But its coolest feature may be its bracelet, which has a spring-loaded rapid adjustment system for changing lengths, and a luminous indication of its setting on the clasp. $5,950
The perpetual calendar with a “retrograde” date hand (indicating the date along an arc over the dial) is one of Patek Philippe’s most classic looks, dating back to 1937. But it gets a modish makeover now with a semi-transparent dial in dark gray revealing the workings of the movement beneath. The dial is created by applying a metallized coating to a sapphire crystal surface, and then removing material with a laser, creating a shadowy effect with a gradient that intensifies towards the edges. $117,000
Grand Seiko’s Spring Drive technology, which fuses mechanical watchmaking with a quartz-driven oscillator is a modern watchmaking marvel. Using a tiny charge driven by the mainspring, it produces a neat, fluid glide in the seconds hand, and results in accuracy of around +/-15 seconds a month (which works out as almost four times better than Rolex’s Superlative Chronometer rating of +/-2 a day). On a yearly basis, then, normal Spring Drive is accurate to around three minutes a year.
But its newly announced upgrade on the tech, which Grand Seiko is calling Ultra Fine Accuracy (UFA), is accurate to +/-20 seconds a year. That's comparable with high-accuracy electronic watches. It’s achievement is due to a three-month process Seiko has developed for aging the quartz crystals, along with a thermo-compensation system and vacuum-sealed oscillator and sensor to protect against environmental factors. It’s found in a handsome addition to the brand’s Evolution 9 collection, available in either titanium or platinum, with a dial inspired by snow-covered trees. From $10,900
While ceramic-cased watches in various shades of zirconium oxide have become a popular feature of high-end watches in the past decade—and particularly so at Hublot, which has its own in-house materials laboratory—combining different shades of ceramic is a much bigger challenge. That’s because different shades perform differently in the high-heat sintering process involved. So far, the two-tone bezels of Rolex’s GMT Master watches have been the chief examples of this being achieved successfully, but Hublot’s “Magic Ceramic” Big Bang takes things further. The gray bezel and blue cylinder dots are made separately and then fused in the furnace, which is much trickier than it sounds. Limited to 20 pieces, it’s a pointer to more creative uses of ceramic in years to come. $33,000
This is the world's lightest mechanical dive watch, so Ulysse Nardin claims, as the brand has supposedly managed to remove as much as possible from its new diver to make it clock in at a featherweight 52 grams on the wrist (46 if you remove the elastic fabric strap). The Diver [AIR]—yes, the brackets are intentional—has a construction of titanium and carbon fiber offering up 200 meters of water resistance. The sides of the case, including the lugs, are made from recycled fishing nets and upcycled carbon fiber called Nylo-Foil. The new caliber, UN-374, further reduces heft with, among other trimmings, titanium bridges that have been cut in width and hollowed out in the center. The end result is that, inside the case, the Diver [AIR] is apparently 80 percent air and just 20 percent movement. Despite this, it's still able to withstand a 5,000-g impact. $38,000
Furthering the technical achievements of Bovet's superb world-first world-timer, the Récital 28, one of our picks from last year's show, the Récital 30 again tackles one of the biggest challenges of traditional world-timers: daylight saving time. The 28 was powered by a movement delivering an impressive 10-day power reserve, and was housed in a 46.3-mm case to go with its near $757,000 price tag.
Here, Bovet's Récital 30 features the same clever world-timer system with its 24 city rollers, but with a more streamlined approach thanks to a titanium case that is 42 mm and 12.9-mm thick (the power reserve is now down to 60 hours). The 2 o’clock pusher rotates each roller by 90 degrees, automatically adjusting all 24 time zones. The 4 o’clock pusher advances the central 24-hour world dial by one hour. This roller system allows adjustment to any of the four annual UTC periods: UTC Coordinated Universal Time; AST, American Summer Time; EAS, European and American Summer Time; and EWT, European Winter Time. Even New Delhi, with its 30-minute offset, is accounted for. Pricing is yet to be set, but it will be “more accessible” than the Récital 28—though still very much aimed at the luxury consumer.
Oris's Big Crown is a classic of its range, and has been one of the brand's most popular pilot's watches since its release in 1938. Having evolved with the times, the models in the new collection continue this ethos, and many are lauding the new Big Crown Pointer Dates with their colorful dials, but here at WIRED we were taken with the decidedly chic and wearable 34-mm Big Crown Diamonds with 12 lab-grown diamond hour markers. £2,500/$3,220

The midtown Manhattan building where Jackie Kennedy, Elizabeth Taylor, and Truman Capote once dined, then the legendary French restaurant La Grenouille, is now a nondescript renovation site with wood, metal, and industrial-size garbage bins strewn about. The 60-year home of La Grenouille will soon be turned into the new American home of Quanjude, the most famous Peking duck restaurant brand in China. Quanjude, a publicly listed company controlled by a state-owned entity, bought the 6,800-square-foot building on 52nd Street for $14.3 million in October in an attempt to bring Chinese fine dining to America.

        The 161-year-old brand's first branch in the US is going all out. The wallpaper will replicate a 12th-century Chinese handscroll painting. The private dining room will be decorated with traditional fans and chopsticks. But it is the quality of the food that Yan Zhang, the head of Quanjude America, wants diners to obsess about. ""Chinese cuisine is exquisite and profound. But in this part of the world, people think it's just spring rolls and chow mein,"" Zhang said. ""We want to revamp their cognition.""
    

        Quanjude is one of at least 10 major Chinese food and beverage brands planning to hit US shores this year. Driven by an oversaturated market, a troubled economy back home, and the potential to be listed on the US stock market, companies serving everything from high-end dinners to dumplings and milk tea — several of them with thousands of locations in China — are now poised to break into the US food market. And dozens more are planning to study the landscape to possibly jump in themselves.
    

        But with the relationship between the US and China at one of its rockiest points since the two countries resumed their diplomatic relationship in 1979, the Chinese newcomers' path to success is extremely precarious. Sure, they aren't working on critical technology or launching major social media platforms, but Chinese restaurants have still faced backlash in the past few years, with some Americans blaming the country for the COVID pandemic or because of a general antipathy toward the Chinese Communist Party. Is America really ready for what some local Chinese restaurant insiders are calling a Chinese food ""tsunami""?
    

        Since the first Chinese restaurant in the US opened in 1849 in San Francisco during the gold rush, generations of blue-collar immigrants have taken advantage of the relatively low-cost entry point in the restaurant industry to make ends meet. They created dishes that are nonexistent in China, such as chop suey or General Tso's chicken, to cater to Western palettes, forming an expectation among Americans that Chinese cuisine is convenient and cheap. Chinese immigrants, meanwhile, have had to watch their cuisine sink to the bottom of their adopted country's food chain.
    

        When Zhang started traveling around North America for his import and export business 18 years ago, he couldn't bear the Chinese food he came across. ""Nothing is authentic other than the beef noodle,"" he said. A foodie himself, Zhang vowed to make a difference. In 2017, he reached out to Quanjude, proposing to bring the iconic restaurant to North America. He opened the first branch in Vancouver, Canada, in early 2020, right before the pandemic ravaged indoor dining. In 2022, it won a Michelin star, which it has held onto since — and Zhang expects the New York branch to get even greater plaudits.
    

        ""Chinese immigrants are better educated and wealthier now. We crave for a better presentation of our own culture,"" said Zhang. ""It is the best time for food brands in China to expand overseas.""
    

        While there are some Chinese fine-dining restaurants in the US run by Chinese Americans, the new wave brings some of the best-known restaurant brands in China.
    

        The timing is made more urgent by China's recent economic troubles. The Chinese government says the revenue of the food and beverage industry in the country increased just 5.3% in 2024, a nosedive from the 20.4% increase in 2023, and the smallest growth in a decade excluding the pandemic years. An industry report on 22 publicly listed Chinese food and beverage companies found that 68% saw their profits decline in the first half of last year. Close to 3 million restaurants and cafs in China shut down for good last year.
    

        Chinese food brands' moves to open overseas — which had been increasing modestly since the 1980s — have rapidly accelerated. Hongcan Industry Research Institute, a Chinese group that studies the restaurant industry, released a report in September that found more than 100 Chinese food and beverage brands have moved into more than 180 countries, now running 700,000 locations outside China — a 200,000 increase since 2016. The Chinese government has spurred on the expansion, issuing two directives last year for Chinese food and beverage brands to ""go overseas"" to help ""improve the international influence of Chinese cuisine culture.""
    

        ""Almost all the major food and beverage brands you see in China are considering coming to the US,"" said Beichen Hu, a restaurant investor and the director of the North America Asian Food Industry Association. ""A popular catchphrase circulating broadly in the food industry in China is 'to go overseas or to die.'""
    

        The US market certainly looks appealing. The food service industry reached over $1 trillion in sales last year, with $1.5 trillion projected in 2025. A survey by the National Restaurant Association found that 80% of restaurant operators in the US expect their sales this year to be the same or higher than last year's. An analysis by IBISWorld predicted a promising market for Chinese restaurants in the US through 2030 as the demand for Chinese food among households with annual income above $100,000 is expected to increase.
    

        For as much of a setback as it was, the pandemic also offered a rare opportunity. ""Many prime locations in coveted places like Manhattan are vacant after the pandemic, and that opens the market for brands from China,"" said Tom Chen, the founder of Kepler Mission Design Group, a design and branding company that's helped food and beverage chains from China open in the US. Leading Chinese brands have snatched up space in competitive areas like Fifth Avenue and Times Square in New York and Beverly Hills in Los Angeles.
    

        ""These brands don't want to be just another Chinese restaurant in the US; they want the esteem,"" said Chao Wang, the owner of the rice-noodle shop Hunan Slurp in New York's East Village. He's helping restaurants from Hunan province, where he's from, to open in the US. ""To have a store in Manhattan is like erecting a flag on the moon. It's worth it even if you don't make money.""
    

        Still, the cuisine push from China may seem counterintuitive. The tension between the US and China, especially Washington's restrictions on Chinese tech companies in recent years, has created a palpable chilling effect. Figures on foreign investment from China vary significantly, but they all show a steep drop in Chinese investment into the US in the last several years. The most recent annual survey by the China General Chamber of Commerce — USA found that in 2023, more than 60% of Chinese companies in the US complained about the deteriorating business environment and 22% had reduced investment here.
    

        But geopolitical risks are not top of mind for most eateries. ""The US is still a pro-business country. And we sell consumer products, not computer chips,"" said Amanda Wang, the owner of Ningji, the leading Chinese chain of lemon-based teas, with more than 3,000 stores in China. Its first overseas outlet is opening in mid-April in Los Angeles with a product line customized for American consumers called bobobaba. And the company is already looking for more locations.
    

        Wang said the biggest cultural shock for her is the time it takes to open a store in the US. Ningji decided to take over the fully functioning venue of a shuttered beverage store in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale last November, but as of early February, Wang was still waiting for the license to be approved to start the renovation. ""I am speechless,"" said Wang. ""We open a new store on average in 20 days in China.""
    

        Wang was also confused by a recent street encounter. Two days before the new year, on her way to the supermarket, a stranger yelled at her to ""go back to China,"" and blamed her for stealing jobs in the US. ""I don't understand why he thought I stole his job,"" said Wang. ""We are here to create jobs.""
    

        This kind of hostility isn't exactly rare. A Pew Research Center survey from May found that eight in 10 Americans have negative views about China, and a study by researchers from Boston College, the University of Michigan, and Microsoft found that Asian restaurants in the US lost $7.4 billion in revenue in 2020 because of anti-Chinese sentiment, which President Donald Trump helped stoke by calling COVID-19 the China virus.
    

        ""Trump likes to stir racial antagonism,"" Chao Wang of Hunan Slurp said. The window of a noodle shop Wang owned in Long Island City, New York, was smashed during the pandemic, and he attributed it to anti-Asian hate.
    

        Yong Zhao, the cofounder and chief executive of the American food chains Junzi Kitchen and Nice Day, had a disturbing moment a few months ago with a customer at his store in Long Island. ""I told him we are going to bring organic mushrooms from a local farm into our recipes, and he said, 'Oh, is the farm owned by the CCP?'"" said Zhao. The customer was referring to the rising concern that the Chinese Communist Party is spying on the US from farmlands purchased by Chinese entities. ""If I were white, I don't think he'd have asked.""
    

        Before the pandemic, Zhao, a Yale-educated environmental scientist turned restaurateur, had formed a network of young Chinese restaurant operators in the US with a mission to ""tell the stories of Chinese cuisine."" But he said since the trade war began in 2018, American media has much less coverage of Chinese culture and lifestyle, and Americans seem less interested in Chinese culture. ""Say, you want to highlight the history of a traditional dish from Chengdu, but many people here don't know where Chengdu is,"" said Zhao, referring to the southwestern Chinese city that is known for mapo tofu and kung pao chicken.
    

        To some industry people I spoke with, Chinese food companies are less likely to be caught up in geopolitical wrangling than, say, the tech industry, but their biggest risk factor may be their own growth. ""This is an industry that is safe until Chinese companies start to win, and then they're not safe,"" said Chris Pereira, the founder and CEO of iMpact, a New York-based consulting firm that has helped hundreds of Chinese enterprises enter the US.
    

        Before he founded iMpact in 2020, Pereira worked as an executive at Huawei, the Chinese tech conglomerate that was driven out of the US market over national security concerns. Having watched that play out, Pereira suggests big Chinese food chains find ways to share profits with American partners as a form of self-protection. For instance, he said, if Luckin Coffee, the Chinese coffeehouse behemoth with more than 22,000 locations in China that plans to come to the US this year, starts to steal market share from Starbucks, ""you can bet the US government will find a way to talk about national security for coffee.""
    

        In a crowded back office at Quanjude's Manhattan site, Zhang has a more urgent challenge. The visa applications for the five chefs he plans to bring in from China are still pending. Since US-China relations started deteriorating, it's been harder to obtain visas for Chinese nationals, but Zhang says the Chinese-trained chefs are essential for the restaurant. ""We won't allow the quality of the food to suffer under untrained hands,"" he said. If nothing else works out, he plans to bring Quanjude chefs from Canada.
    

        Zhang thinks his ducks could serve an important mission. ""I believe food is the best bridge for divisions and it may help pull the US and China closer again,"" he said.
    

        After a pause, he continued. ""Except if there is a hot war,"" he said, ""everything Chinese in the US would be doomed.""

13,2025-04-05,"Aston Villa manager Unai Emery has the best win percentage in the club's managerial history
Unai Emery has always been a manager who dreams big.
""My dream is to win the Champions League,"" he told Aston Villa fans after guiding them back into Europe in 2023. The notion of Villa helping him achieve that would have, then, been almost laughable.
Now, after his side beat third-placed Nottingham Forest 2-1 in the Premier League for a seventh consecutive win in all competitions, the Spanish manager has got the whole club dreaming big with him.
The victory moves Aston Villa level on points with fifth-placed Manchester City and in with a chance of qualifying for the Champions League - via their league position - for the second successive season.
They also have a Champions League quarter-final to look forward to against Ligue 1 champions Paris St-Germain on Wednesday, and are in the FA Cup semi-finals against Crystal Palace.
Back in October 2022, Emery replaced Steven Gerrard as manager, with Villa only out of the Premier League relegation zone on goal difference.
Now, as well as still challenging in Europe, they are just two wins from a first major domestic trophy for 29 years and their first FA Cup since 1957.
But just how good has Emeryâs two-year reign been? What has he done to turn Villa's flagging fortunes around? And how good could things get?
Villa survive Forest fightback to boost Euro hopes
Only three teams have won more Premier League points than Aston Villa since his arrival
He led the club to seventh and fourth-place finishes in the past two seasons, having not finished in the top seven since 2010
Aston Villa have won seven consecutive games in all competitions for the first time since a 10-game winning run between March and April 2019 (while playing in the Championship), doing so as a top-flight side for the first time since March 1981
Emery is the first Aston Villa manager to have two separate runs of 15 unbeaten Premier League home games
Villa are into the quarter-finals of the Champions League this season
Emery has the best win percentage of any manager in Aston Villa history (54%)

PSG are favourites but Villa will try and compete - Emery
Emery's arrival at Villa Park in 2022 marked a new chapter for the club.
He brought with him six backroom staff, with many of the old guard departing, and then Monchi arrived as president of football operations in June 2023 - having previously worked with Emery at Sevilla, winning three Europa League titles together.
Emery has certainly been backed in the transfer market, spending about Â£295m on 23 signings over the past four windows - including the impressive loan captures of Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio.
It has not all been plain sailing though, with the club being held back by the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), having to raise funds in the summer by selling academy graduates Omari Kellyman and Tim Iroegbunam, as well as Douglas Luiz and Moussa Diaby for significant money.
With a net transfer spend of about Â£15m, the club's recruitment has been even more impressive.
Spanish football expert and Emery biographer Guillem Balague explains how the Villa boss has stuck rigidly to his recruitment plan.
""He has always endeavoured to bring in and play the type of players that possessed the necessary characteristics and shared his vision as to how the game should be played,"" he said.
""He has sold his vision of this future Aston Villa to the fans and has had to educate them in his ideas, showing them that the success they can achieve should come along with the implementation of a cultured, measured passing game and not merely one that relies on the playing of a non-stop 100mph box-to-box game.""
But what else has Emery brought, away from recruitment and the club's playing style?
Stories emerged of how he had compiled dossiers on each player before joining Villa, and how he can often be seen leaving the club's Bodymoor Heath training ground late into the night.
Balague described how he is also very big on individual coaching, so his players all get clips on their direct opponent.
His attention to detail is a characteristic that is spoken about a lot, as is his tactical brain.
""What separates good managers from great managers is that he has a great way of playing, but his in-game management is so amazing as well,"" Villa defender Tyrone Mings told Ben Foster's Fozcast podcast.
Midfielder John McGinn added to BBC Sport: ""No matter what happens until now and whenever he leaves - we hope it's never - he will certainly go down as one of our club's greatest managers.""
There is no limit to the ambitions of Emery - a master of knockout football who has won 10 trophies as a manager, nine of them in cups.
""My dream is to be a winner as a coach in the Champions League. Hopefully with Aston Villa,"" he told Sky Sports. ""The Premier League is very difficult to win.
""But, here Leicester won. This is the reason in football it is not impossible.""
So how good can this season become?
Villa have proved over the past two years they can beat anyone on their day, seeing off Bayern Munich this campaign and beating Arsenal and Manchester City last season.
So what about Champions League success?
Emery has already proved himself to be a European master, winning four Europa Leagues and managing six different clubs in the Champions League.
PSG will prove a tough test for the Midlanders though and, with Real Madrid or Arsenal waiting in a semi-final, they will have to do it the hard way.
Villa have also won the competition before - albeit back in 1982 - while Porto's 2004 success under Jose Mourinho shows it is possible to upset the giants of Europe.
Seeing the likes of Tottenham and Borussia Dortmund reach the final in recent years should also give Villa reasons for encouragement.
Winning the Champions League might prove a step too far but, going by their current results in Europe, nobody will fancy playing Emery's men in the latter stages of the competition.

WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 17: A Tesla showroom is seen in the City Center shopping center on January ... More 17, 2023 in Washington, DC. The automaker decreased the prices of their Tesla's by 20 percent, a move seen as a reaction to competition in the global market for electric vehicles and rising inflation rates.

Tesla’s stock price behavior is baffling to most analysts and investors. Media attention in major outlets such as the Financial Times and Bloomberg have been highlighting the stock price’s strange twists and turns.
The behavior of the company’s stock price stems from its movements being at stark odds with underlying fundamentals. There are compelling reasons to infer that the price-fundamentals gap might be part psychological and part manipulation.
Hyperbole is a psychological phenomenon. An article that appeared in the Financial Times explicitly mentions hyperbole as being one of Tesla’s major assets. This article refers to after-hours traders parking fundamentals and instead trading on vibes.
Consider the following line in the song “I Dreamed a Dream” from the musical Les Misérables: “But the tigers come at night, with their voices soft as thunder.” These tigers serve as a metaphor for market participants who are engaged in manipulative trading activities in the after-market. The Financial Times asks whether something else is going on with overnight trading in Tesla’s stock, besides vibes.
An article that appeared in Bloomberg discusses whether the “something else” might be price manipulation by quantitative market-neutral trading firms. The alleged manipulation involves these firms inflating their portfolios around the opening of the market, and reducing the inflated positions around the same day close.
JPMorgan analysts have been tracking Tesla’s price-fundamentals gap for over a decade. The Financial Times interviewed its lead analyst Ryan Brinkman. Brinkman has been bearish on the stock for several years. His approach to fundamentals-based valuation centers on the present value of a company’s forecasted free cash flows. Free cash flows are defined as the amount of cash a company generates in period of time (such as a year), which is available to be paid to both the company’s debtholders and shareholders. The fundamental value of the company’s stock is determined by the portion of the free cash flows available to be paid just to the shareholders.
Only a minority of analysts use the PV of free cash flows when setting price targets. In this respect, Morgan Stanley sell-side analysts also assess Tesla’s price-fundamental gap using the PV of free cash flows. Notably, the Morgan Stanley analysts have been more bullish on Tesla’s fundamentals than their JPMorgan counterparts. To see why, consider the chart below. The chart depicts the free cash flow forecasts developed in 2020 by the teams at the two firms, for the period 2020 through 2035. Notice that after 2021, the Morgan Stanley forecasts lie above the JPMorgan counterparts.
Tesla's Free Cash Flows Over Time. Forecasts by JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, 2020-2035, along with ... More actual values, 2020-2024.
On a technical point, I should mention that analysts rarely report the values associated with the constant growth portions of their forecasts, called the “terminal horizon forecasts.” I have constructed these values by using inferential formulas. Notably, most of Tesla’s fundamental value relates to the terminal horizon.
The free cash flow chart also displays the value of Tesla’s actual free cash flows for the period 2020 through 2024. In fact, the chart displays two actual free cash flow streams. The first is labeled FCF and the second is labeled FCF:Capex. FCF are the cash flows that conform to the definition of free cash flow provided above, namely the amount of cash a company generates over time, which is available to be paid to both the company’s debtholders and shareholders. A key term in the formula for FCF is cash flow from investment. In practice, analysts use capital expenditure in place of cash flow from investment; and therefore, FCF:Capex does the same.
The chart indicates that analysts at JPMorgan underestimated Tesla’s FCF:Capex for the entire period 2021 through 2024, while the analysts at Morgan Stanley underestimated Tesla’s FCF:Capex for 2021 and 2022, and overestimated FCF:Capex in 2023 and 2024.
As for the period after 2024, a report in Seeking Alpha describes a pessimistic sales outlook for Tesla. The article emphasizes the damage to Tesla’s brand, stemming from the role of Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk in mass U.S. government layoffs. Extrapolating the FCF:Capex chart for the period 2025 through 2035 suggests that the JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley forecasts might both prove to be highly optimistic.
Even more important is that the actual free cash flow stream, FCF, lies well below the FCF:Capex stream. In fact, FCF is negative for 2023 and 2024. This means that during 2023 and 2024, the direction of cash flow was from the debtholders and shareholders of Tesla to the company, not the reverse. In reality, both analyst teams overestimated Tesla’s free cash flows in the years 2022, 2023, and 2024.
The upshot of this free cash flow overestimation is that analysts have been overestimating Tesla’s fundamental value for years. I made this point previously, in a post titled “How Overvalued Is Tesla’s Stock, Really?” As for hyperbole and psychology, I made this point in a post entitled “Tesla’s Powerful Narrative Is Propelling Its Stock Price.”
Since mid-December, Tesla’s stock has fallen by 51% at a time when the S&P 500 has fallen by 16%. Yet, as the Seeking Alpha article reminds us, Tesla’s market cap still exceeds the combined market caps of Toyota, Ferrari, General Motors, Honda, Stellantis, and Ford Motor.
The manipulation contention about Tesla’s stock has been advanced compellingly by Bruce Knuteson, the CEO of Kn-X. The type of manipulation involves a trader increasing a security in his or her portfolio at the open, when liquidity is low, in order to drive up the price of the security. The trader then sells the security at the close, when liquidity is higher. Because of the difference in liquidity, the consequent decrease in price at the close is smaller in magnitude than the increase in price at the open, and so, as a result, the value of the trader’s portfolio increases .
Following Knuteson’s lead, I analyzed the difference between the behavior of Tesla’s stock overnight, between the prior day close and the next day’s opening, and the behavior during trading day between open and close. Ignoring transaction costs, traders who bought at the open and sold at the close, from the time Tesla went public in 2010, would have earned an average return of -2.7 basis points per trading session. Had they instead bought at the close and sold at the open, they would have earned, on average, 18.6 basis points per (after-market) session.
The difference in returns is colossal. The chart below displays the cumulative effect of doing these trades daily, beginning in 2010. Ignoring trading costs, overnight trading results in an initial dollar investment being worth about $500 today. In contrast, that same dollar invested intraday over the same period would have shrunk to 61 cents. Notice that the two series in the chart relate to different vertical axes. If both series were graphed using a single vertical axis, the (blue) intraday series would hug the horizontal axis.
Tesla stock cumulative return series for the overnight nontrading session (left vertical axis) and ... More intraday trading session (right vertical axis), June 30, 2010 through April 4, 2025.
Because the volatility per hour from market open to market close (1.2%) is greater than the volatility per hour from close to open (0.5%), it is reasonable to expect a higher return from the trading day session. However, the numbers for Tesla clearly do not stem from a difference in trading session length. In addition, trading costs are large enough to prevent an arbitrage opportunity here.
The Bloomberg article mentioned above points out that Knuteson has been arguing, for almost a decade, that the overnight trading puzzle is widespread and stems from market manipulation. The Bloomberg article also mentions a recent publication in the Journal of Investment Management by Victor Haghani, Vladimir Ragulin and Richard Dewey. Their work, which received the Harry Markowitz Best JOIM Paper Award this year, provides an explanation for the phenomenon based on the trading of “meme stocks.”
The “meme stock” argument involves individual investors choosing stocks mostly when not at work and markets are closed, and placing trade orders to be executed at the open. In a rejoinder, Knuteson explains why he finds the meme stock explanation unconvincing. Indeed, he discusses a range of possible alternative explanations, and concludes that only manipulation can account for the full extent of the phenomenon.
The two issues, price-valuation gap and manipulation, come together in interesting ways. During regular trading hours, it is as if traders fully appreciate that Tesla’s stock price is overvalued relative to fundamentals. As a result, returns during trading hours are typically negative. In addition, the return standard deviations per session, are larger for intraday than overnight, 2.8% as opposed to 2.1%. This means that intraday trading features lower returns and higher volatility. In this respect, keep in mind that according to textbook theory, returns and risk should be positively correlated, not the reverse. This is one reason why behavioral finance, not traditional finance, is better at explaining the financial world.
The same two issues come together in respect to persistence of the phenomenon over time, psychological denial, and private interests. In respect to the price-valuation gap, for almost two decades, analysts have resisted the contention that their free cash flow-based valuations are upwardly biased. I have documented this issue in JOIM, in the Journal of Portfolio Management, and on my Forbes blog.
In respect to manipulation, Knuteson points out that the overnight return puzzle applies broadly, including to the S&P 500. In an email exchange with me, he reports the arithmetic means and standard deviations for each of the two S&P 500 SPDR ETF series, for the time period January 29, 1993 through March 31, 2025. These are respectively 4 basis points (mean) and 67 basis points (standard deviation) for overnight, and 0.5 basis points (mean) and 96 basis points (standard deviation) for intraday.
The difference in means, when compounded, are colossal. Knuteson asks why this phenomenon, which is stark, widespread, and documented, has gained such little attention from regulators, academics, and investors. The Bloomberg article applies the term “conspiracy theory” to the manipulation claim. In his rejoinder to the Bloomberg article, Knuteson makes the following remarks, where references to [8], [2022], and [2023] refer to his posts and other comments.
“By far the biggest conspiracy here is the years-long decision by regulators, other government officials, economists, journalists, finance industry professionals, and others to hide these strikingly suspicious return patterns and the apparent absence of any innocuous explanation for them from the public at large. This conspiracy is genuinely astounding. But it isn't a theory. It is an objective, indisputable fact. I have extensively documented it (including in the public thread with the SEC and others made available with [2023]). The years-long hiding of these strikingly suspicious return patterns from the public is a historic conspiracy regardless of what the correct explanation for these suspicious return patterns turns out to be. The aspect of this problem most deserving the term ""conspiracy"" is the indisputable fact that the public at large still (still!) has absolutely no idea these suspicious return patterns that nobody can innocuously explain even exist [8]. Of course, as I point out in [2023] and elsewhere, this well-documented, objectively factual, undisputed, still (still!) ongoing ""conspiracy"" requires no large, secret, sinister network -- just a bunch of people with bad incentives who lack the integrity to do the right thing.”
Cognitive dissonance, motivated reasoning, and the pressure to conform are powerful psychological forces that can prevent people from accepting the truth. Cognitive dissonance is about resolving conflicts in information by choosing what is most comfortable. Motivated reasoning is about rationalizing such a choice, when that comfort is connected to incentives. The pressure to conform is about the discomfort that comes from expressing dissent within a group.
Hyping stocks and overvaluation relative to fundamentals leads people to feel more comfortable than if stocks were fairly priced. Ignoring the price-valuation gap can be viewed as cognitive dissonance. Ignoring that the bulk of stock returns arrive in the dark of night is a form of motivated reasoning. As for the pressure to conform, Knuteson suggests the following about those working for firms engaged in the alleged manipulation.
“at some point, a quant who has been around long enough has acquired a sufficiently informed understanding of the group's activities to recognize the problem and its serious implications. Most quants at that point won't speak up -- social pressure, good pay, the plausible deniability afforded by willful blindness, and the absence of an obviously effective way to address the problem will together be more than enough to keep almost anyone quiet.”
The valuation of Tesla is fascinating, and in respect to psychological forces at work, it is just the tip of the iceberg."

Tariffs haven't been raised this dramatically in a long time, perhaps because the last time they were, it made the Great Depression much worse.

        President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced substantial tariffs on products imported to the US, including a baseline 10% on all countries, with higher tariffs on countries the White House considers ""the worst offenders"" against US trade relations. That includes a 49% tariff for Cambodia, 46% for Vietnam, 20% for the European Union, and a total effective tariff of 54% for China.
    

        Trump's tariffs ""represent a complete reversal of how the United States has dealt with the question of global trade for the better nine tenths of a century,"" Eric Rauchway, a historian and distinguished professor at the University of California Davis, told Business Insider.
    

        ""By 1948, it become consensus belief across US political parties, and indeed throughout the world, that tariffs had helped cause the Great Depression and the Second World War,"" Rauchway said. ""The policies we've had since then have been intended to avoid a repeat of those things.""
    

        Before the general consensus around free trade became the norm, the US had a long history of tariffs. An early action of the first US Congress was the Tariff Act of 1789, which introduced tariffs to pay government wages and fund the national debt. Until the 16th Amendment was ratified in 1913, which set up the modern system of federal income taxes, tariffs were the federal government's primary source of revenue.
    

        The last time tariffs were this high followed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930.
    

        Following the stock market crash in 1929, President Herbert Hoover signed the act into law in an effort to protect American farmers and manufacturersagainst imports from Europe, where overproduction after World War I was increasing competition and lowering prices. The act raised already-high import duties on foreign agricultural products and manufactured goods — the Fordney-McCumber Act of 1922 had already raised the average import tax to around 40% — by an additional 20% on average.
    

        Smoot-Hawley accelerated a cycle of retaliation that had begun in the 1920s, as other countries raised their tariffs right back at the US, Rauchway said.
    

        ""By the end of the thirties, you have lots and lots of high tariff laws,"" Rauchway said. ""So that just reduces the volume of world trade. And that's bad because the Depression was a global phenomenon and a lot of people needed to sell into other markets for their economies to recover.""
    

        As a result, trade between the US and Europe declined by two-thirds, and European banks began to fail. And with a weakened world economy, extremist ideologies flourished in Europe and World War II began.
    

        A reduction of tariff rates began under the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration in 1934, but really accelerated after World War II with the 1948 establishment of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which later became the World Trade Organization, Rauchway said.
    

        ""After WWII, the United States did not want to repeat the mistakes of isolationism which had guided the response to the end of WWI, such as not joining the League of Nations,"" Felix Stossmeister, an expert on trade policy and Ph.D. student at Ohio University, told Business Insider. Because the British Empire was too weakened by the war to ""play its old role as guarantor of an international trading order,"" Stossmeister said, ""the United States felt that it had to step up.""
    

        To promote international trade and stable exchange rates, the US ""played a crucial role"" in setting up several major economic development institutions, Stossmeister said.
    

        By the Cold War, ""free trade often meant access to American markets for (potential) allies, lest they possibly fall to the Communist side or at least develop sympathies,"" Stossmeister said. But, he added, using ""anti-Communism as a rationale for freer trade faded along with the Soviet Union.""
    

        While Trump's latest tariff policy reverses the bipartisan consensus around free trade that has marked much of the last century, it does bring the Republican party back to its roots as the pro-tariff party prior to the Great Depression, Rauchway said.
    

        Since Trump's tariff announcement, US stocks have been plummeting, suffering their worst single-day loss in five years on Thursday. Economy and markets experts are warning the tariffs will increase inflation and raise the overall price of goods in the US.

20,2025-04-05,"Entry-level wireless headphones with multiple listening options, at $70 off.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

If you're in the market for a wireless over-ear headphone deal, this one might be worth checking out. For a limited time, you can get 35% off the great-sounding Beats Solo 4 wireless headphones at Amazon and other retailers, representing $70 off the sticker price.
Beyond sporting high-quality, neutrally-tuned audio, the Solo 4s also have impressive battery life, mechanical buttons, and native features for both Android and Apple devices. Plus, they let users connect via Bluetooth, USB-C, or a 3.5mm headphone jack, though they do miss out on a few modern features like active noise cancellation. If those aren't dealbreakers for you, these are definitely worth considering compared to other competitors around this price.
Beats Solo 4 Wireless Headphones: $199.95 $129.95 at Amazon
Amazon and other retailers have cut $70 off the price of the Beats Solo 4 Bluetooth headphones, marking 35% off the normal purchase price. The most recent iteration of these headphones features a more balanced frequency response than past generations, along with a comfortable ""on-ear"" cup style that buyers like.
Price comparison: Best Buy - $129.99 | Walmart - $129.95
✅Recommended if: you want headphones with comfortable ear cups; you're looking for a pair of headphones with a balanced audio profile and high-quality sound.
❌Skip this deal if: you want a pair of headphones with a particularly bass-heavy response; you need active noise cancellation; you'd prefer earbuds or different-sized on-ear headphones.
The Beats Solo 4 wireless headphones are a solid audio effort, though they don't sport ANC or some of the modern AI features many of today's best wireless headphones have. Still, those who do get these generally like them for their mechanical button controls, their comfortable mid-size, on-ear fit, and the balanced audio profile in departure of the bass-driven nature of past Beats efforts.
Another major benefit of these headphones is that they can be used to listen to audio through Bluetooth, USB-C, or a headphone jack, which has become less common in recent years. Beats also says they offer up to 50 hours of battery life per charge, and they'll charge to around 5 hours of playback in just 10 minutes or so. You can also get them in four colors: Cloud Pink, Black and Gold, Matte Black, and Slate Blue.
While the lack of ANC might make these a no-go for some, the audio quality, broad connectivity, and comfort make it a competitive pick, especially with this discount.

21,2025-04-05,"President Donald Trump defended his tariff policy while taking aim at China in a Truth Social post Saturday morning, urging Americans to “hang tough” as the sweeping levies he imposed on most countries this week caused global markets to plunge and sparked Republican pushback.

Trump said the tariffs “won’t be easy, but the end result will be historic,” appearing to acknowledge economists’ fears the tariffs will cause consumer prices to rise and send the United States “perilously close” to a recession.
Trump also slammed China, which said Friday Trump’s tariff “seriously undermines China's legitimate rights and interests” and announced it would retaliate by imposing a 34% duty on U.S. goods, matching Trump’s new 34% tariff against the country.
China and “many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,” Trump said, accusing them of using the United States as a “whipping post,” echoing his rationale for the tariffs as he has accused other countries of “taking advantage” of the United States.
Trump dubiously claimed the United States has seen “more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT,” though it’s unclear where this figure is from, and it comes five days after he claimed he has secured $3 trillion in private investment during his second term.
The $5 trillion figure echoes the total stock market losses following Trump’s chaotic tariff rollout, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,680 points Thursday and another 2,200 on Friday, marking the sharpest declines since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020.
Trump has continued to defend his “Liberation Day” tariffs policy despite early stock market chaos and growing backlash from members of his own party. “THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING,” Trump said in a Truth Social post Thursday, claiming the economy will be “FAR STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER, AND MORE RESILIENT.” Trump’s press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday there is “not going to be any pain” from the tariffs for American companies or workers, claiming Americans can “expect price stability.” Trump announced his sweeping tariff policy Wednesday, imposing steep rates on nearly every country.
The Chinese State Council’s Tariff Commission said Friday the United States’ tariffs are “typical unilateral bullying” while warning they threaten both U.S. and global economic interests. China’s new 34% tariff imposed against the United States will take effect April 10 and affect all goods imported from the U.S. Trump slammed China’s retaliation in a Friday morning Truth Social post: “CHINA PLAYED IT WRONG, THEY PANICKED - THE ONE THING THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO DO!” China also reportedly backed off from a deal to sell TikTok to a U.S.-based company after Trump announced his tariffs, just days before the TikTok sale deadline, which Trump extended.
Trump’s tariffs have raised alarms among economists and members of Congress. JP Morgan Chase’s chief economist Michael Feroli said Trump’s tariffs will “take the economy perilously close to slipping into recession.” Democrats have widely criticized the measure, while a growing number of Republicans have voiced concerns, including Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who said “the last thing we need is to pick fights with the very friends with whom we should be working with to protect against China’s predatory and unfair trade practices.” Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said he is concerned about a trade war and is “not a fan of raising taxes on millions of American cosponsors.” Some Republicans have voiced support for a bill that would require congressional approval for new tariffs, though it’s unclear whether the measure could pass the Republican-majority legislature.

23,2025-04-05,"Business Insider Edition 
If you're looking for work, you could consider applying for a healthcare or transportation job right now. But if you're considering applying to white-collar fields, it may be tougher to land a role.

        New Bureau of Labor Statistics data published Friday showed that more people entered the labor force in March, contributing to a small uptick in unemployment. While newly unemployed Americans may be hopeful to land a job quickly, some people on the job market have struggled to find work. The number of people unemployed long term rose by 40,000 in March.
    

        ""If you've never had a problem getting a job before and suddenly you do, you can't look at it and think, 'I'm the problem,'"" recruiter Kathleen Nolan recently told Business Insider. ""You've got to look at what's going on around you.""
    

        The newly released data reveals where people have been getting hired so far this year.
    

        Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, said the March jobs report showed strength in service and in-person work and less so in white-collar jobs or work that may be more likely to be done remotely.
    

        Healthcare, which typically has in-person roles, has been a constant strength in the labor market, with consistently stronger gains over the past few years. There's an ongoing need for healthcare workers.
    

        There is strength elsewhere in the US economy. Employment in the transportation and warehousing sector rose mainly due to gigs in couriers and messengers, which saw cooler job growth last year. Meanwhile, employment fell in warehousing and storage.
    

        Dean Baker, senior economist for the Center for Economic and Policy Research, said the recent increase in couriers and messengers, which includes people delivering packages, ""could reflect increased demand for items in advance of tariffs."" President Donald Trump unveiled his latest tariff plan on April 2, which will impose a 10% tariff on countries and then a higher tariff on Japan, the European Union, and many other trade partners.
    

        Stahle said construction's gain of 13,000 in March was ""notable because when interest rates started to increase a couple of years ago, that was kind of the industry that everybody thought was going to break first, and yet we see that construction has continued to hold solid.""
    

        Employment increased by 24,000 in this sector from December to March. Associated Builders and Contractors said in a January press release that over 400,000 new construction workers are needed this year to meet demand.
    

        Retail work saw employment rise over the month in March, but the BLS report on Friday said that an end of a strike contributed to that gain. The three-month employment increase showed general merchandise retailers saw the highest growth among the detailed types of retail work.
    

        The three-month employment growth in healthcare was widespread across the sector. It increased by thousands in ambulatory healthcare services, which include doctors' offices and medical labs, while also increasing by thousands in hospitals.
    

        While the federal government is making cuts, the numbers haven't largely been reflected in the BLS jobs report because of the timing of the surveys and people on paid leave, such as probationary workers who have been reinstated after a court order pausing their terminations, being counted as employed. For people still interested in working for the government, local government could be an area to look at, based on its most recent three-month job gain.
    

        Amusement, gambling, and recreation industries were one group within the leisure and hospitality that saw recent strength. Michael Feroli, JPMorgan's chief US economist, said that similar to the construction sector, ""leisure and hospitality may have benefited from better seasonally adjusted weather conditions.""

24,2025-04-05,"If you flew or drove anything remote controlled until the last few years, chances are very good that you’d be using some faceless corporation’s equipment and radio protocols. But recently, open-source options have taken over the market, at least among the enthusiast core who are into squeezing every last bit of performance out of their gear. So why not take it one step further and roll your own complete system?
Apparently, that’s what [Malcolm Messiter] was thinking when, during the COVID lockdowns, he started his own RC project that he’s calling LockDownRadioControl. The result covers the entire stack, from the protocol to the transmitter and receiver hardware, even to the software that runs it all. The 3D-printed remote sports a Teensy 4.1 and off-the-shelf radio modules on the inside, and premium FrSky hardware on the outside. He’s even got an extensive folder of sound effects that the controller can play to alert you. It’s very complete. Heck, the transmitter even has a game of Pong implemented so that you can keep yourself amused when it’s too rainy to go flying.
Of course, as we alluded to in the beginning, there is a healthy commercial infrastructure and community around other open-source RC projects, namely ExpressLRS and OpenTX, and you can buy gear that runs those software straight out of the box, but it never hurts to have alternatives. And nothing is easier to customize and start hacking on than something you built yourself, so maybe [Malcolm]’s full-stack RC solution is right for you? Either way, it’s certainly impressive for a lockdown project, and evidence of time well spent.
Thanks [Malcolm] for sending that one in!
“Heck, the transmitter even has a game of Pong implemented so that you can keep yourself amused when it’s too rainy to go flying.”
What, no Doom?!?
OpenTX is effectively dead and edgeTX is the new successor.
Shows how often I re-flash my transmitter firmware!

25,2025-04-05,"The initial ‘baseline’ tariff comes into effect at US seaports, airports and customs warehouses as stock markets plummet across the world.
US President Donald Trump’s widest-ranging tariffs to date have come into effect – a move that may trigger retaliation and escalate trade tensions, upsetting the global economy.
The initial 10 percent “baseline” tariff took effect at United States seaports, airports and customs warehouses at 12:01am ET (04:01am GMT) on Saturday, ushering in Trump’s full rejection of the post-World War II system of mutually agreed tariff rates.
Among countries first hit with the 10 percent tariff are Australia, Britain, Colombia, Argentina, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
The trade gaps, said the White House, were driven by an “absence of reciprocity” in relationships and other policies like “exorbitant value-added taxes.”
A US Customs and Border Protection bulletin to shippers indicates no grace period for cargoes on the water at midnight on Saturday.
But a US Customs and Border Protection bulletin did provide a 51-day grace period for cargoes loaded onto vessels or planes and in transit to the US before 12:01am ET on Saturday. These cargoes need to arrive by 12:01 am ET (4:01am GMT) on May 27 to avoid the 10 percent duty.
 

 
Moreover, on April 9, Trump’s higher “reciprocal” tariff rates of 11 percent to 50 percent are due to take effect. European Union imports will be hit with a 20 percent tariff, while Chinese goods will be hit with a 34 percent tariff, bringing Trump’s total new levies on China to 54 percent.
Vietnam, which benefitted from the shift of US supply chains away from China after Trump’s first-term trade war with Beijing, will be hit with a 46 percent tariff. The country, however, agreed on Friday to discuss a deal with Trump.
Canada and Mexico are both exempt from Trump’s latest duties because they are still subject to a 25 percent tariff related to the US fentanyl crisis for goods that do not comply with the US-Mexico-Canada rules of origin.
Michael Strain, director of Economic Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, told Al Jazeera that the US tariffs have been greeted quite poorly by the investors.
“This would have a really bad effect on the economic outcome of workers and households and businesses,” he said, adding that the move “would constitute a tax increase of 400-500 billion dollars this year on American households and on businesses”.
“The combination of big increase in taxes and the tariffs would increase the prices of these imported goods that households face [and] would mean that households would very likely see negative income growth… That alone would risk a recession in the US,” he said.
On Friday, China announced that it will impose its own 34 percent tariff on US products from April 10. Beijing also said it would sue the US at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and restrict exports of rare earth elements used in high-end medical and electronics technology.
Trump warned on Friday on social media that “China played it wrong,” saying this was something “they cannot afford to do”.
Other major trading partners have held back as they continue to digest the unfolding international standoff and fears of a recession.
 

 
Trump’s Wednesday tariff announcement shook global stock markets to their core, wiping out $5 trillion in stock market value for S&P 500 companies by Friday’s close, a record two-day decline. Prices for oil and commodities plunged, while investors fled to the safety of government bonds.
Economists have also warned that the tariffs could dampen growth and fuel inflation.
Kelly Ann Shaw, a trade lawyer at Hogan Lovells and former White House trade adviser during Trump’s first term told a Brookings Institution event on Thursday that she expected the tariffs to evolve over time as countries seek to negotiate lower rates.
“This is the single biggest trade action of our lifetime,” she said. “But this is huge. This is a pretty seismic and significant shift in the way that we trade with every country on earth.”
Trump said on his Truth Social platform that his “policies will never change”.
However, his latest tariffs have notable exclusions. They do not stack on recently imposed 25 percent tariffs hitting imports of steel, aluminium and automobiles.
Also temporarily spared are copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors and lumber, alongside “certain critical minerals” and energy products, the White House said.
But Trump has ordered investigations into copper and lumber, which could lead to further duties soon.
He has threatened to hit other industries like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors as well, meaning any reprieve might be limited.

low p/e stocks
It is true: these four stocks with low price-earnings ratios greatly outperformed most other stocks on Friday and all hit new 52-week highs. The reasons for each may vary but generally it’s likely that investors felt that these names would not be greatly affected by the Trump tariffs and the ensuing global trade war.
That a stock could move higher in price while the major stock market indexes dropped dramatically is some kind of achievement. Further research into each situation is probably required but it’s enough to begin with to see such strength in the face of such market weakness.
American Electric Power
American Electric Power daily price chart, 4 5 2025.
The big utility outfit hit a new high early in Friday’s session, just barely a new high but that counts. The stock then spent the rest of the day selling off but managed to stay above the up trending 50-day moving average. Take a look at the relentlessness of the 200-day moving average’s up trend.
American Electric Power has a market capitalization of $55.79 billion. The price-earnings ratio of 18.70 is significantly lower the p/e of 31 for the S&P 500. The debt-to-equity ratio is 1.70. The company pays a 3.61% dividend.
Exelon
Exelon daily price chart, 4 5 25.
This utilities company popped to a new high near the opening of Friday’s trading and then mostly sold off for the rest of the day. The price remains above an up trending 50-day moving average and it’s well above a 200-day moving average that keeps heading higher.
Exelon has a market cap of $45.78 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 18.49. The debt-t0-equity ratio is 1.75. This year’s earnings are up 7.47% and down over the past five years by 4.04%. The stock is a component of the S&P 500 and of the Nasdaq 100. Exelon pays a 3.54% dividend.
Kroger
Kroger daily price chart, 4 5 25.
The grocery store chain hit a new high of $71.93 early on Friday and then profit-taking took it back down to $67.18 at the close. The price stayed above the up trending 50-day moving average. The 200-day moving average continues to move higher. These measures indicate that investors are mostly undeterred about owning shares.
Kroger’s market cap is $44.40 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 18.27. The debt-to-equity ratio is 3.03. This year’s earnings increased 6.04%. Earnings over the past five years are up 12.51%. The company offers investors a dividend of 1.99%.
Pilgrims Pride
Pilgrims Pride daily price chart, 4 5 25.
The new high of $51.54 came early in the session. Sellers came back in and by the close of trading, the stock stopped at $49.97. The price remains above up trending 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Again, this is despite huge selling to below such measures in most other NYSE equities.
The packaged food company specializes in poultry products. Pilgrim’s Pride has a market cap of $11.85 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 10.94. The debt-to-equity ratio is .82. Earnings this year are down 7.02%. Over the past five years, earnings have been up 20.13%.

Can you ever use too much software? Yes, but hear me out first.
by  Kevin Nguyen
There’s a famous two-decade-old Paris Review interview with Haruki Murakami in which he, one of the world’s most celebrated novelists, details his daily routine. He wakes up at 4AM, works for five hours, goes for a run, reads, goes to bed, and then repeats it all over again. The rigor and repetition are the point.
I am not Haruki Murakami.
In addition to my work at The Verge, I write novels — my second one is out this week — and while I admire Murakami’s commitment to an immovable schedule, I’ve found that I produce my best work when I’m constantly rethinking routines, processes, and, mostly, how I’m writing. In the modern age, that means what software I’m using.
What I am about to describe will be a nightmare to anyone who likes all of their tools to work harmoniously. All of these apps are disconnected and do not interoperate with each other in any way. Many of the things they do are redundant and overlap. I suppose this process is quite the opposite of frictionless — but that’s precisely the point. I’m not sure I believe that ambitious creative work is borne from a perfectly efficient workflow.
This is, instead, a journey of moving the work through different pieces of software, depending on what it needed or how I needed to interface with it. Just as being in different locations can inspire or challenge new ideas, moving work through different writing environments can be that shift for your text. What I’m about to detail is less about the specific pieces of software, and more how one might change their approach depending on what the work needs.
At least, that’s how it is for me. Maybe it might be for you, too.
When I start writing a book, I need to quite literally collect my thoughts. It’s the fun part — when the project is all potential, before the realities of how painful it will be to actually make it have set in. I’ll find inspiration in things I’m reading, watching, and listening to; ideas will come to me while I’m riding the subway, when I can’t sleep at night, and even sometimes in the middle of meetings.
Everyone has specific uses for their notes apps, and there are so many available. The slightly counterintuitive / deranged thing is that I use two different ones. Each serves a different purpose.
I use Bear for structured ideas like character sketches or thematic concepts, and I make use of the app’s lightweight tagging system to stay organized. For entirely loose thoughts, I usually paste things into Notes and don’t worry about formatting, context, whatever — I just know it is saved somewhere. (Actually, I have a very adverse reaction to how Notes looks, but it’s the one where my partner prefers to share grocery lists and streaming passwords, so I’m stuck with it.)
The important thing here isn’t that these apps are especially good or tailored to any purpose. I just have a different environment to open on my phone, depending on the type of idea I need to save. One I use when I’m being thoughtful, and another when I need to get something down quickly. And in the moments when I need to save something super fast, I won’t even use a notes app at all — I’ll just text myself. 
Nothing about Bear or Notes interact with each other, and, eventually, I will have to move any useful text out of them. Both of them sync quite nicely to desktop apps, so copying and pasting stuff to a new place is a fairly painless, if not tedious, process. This is, for me, the value of notes apps: combining scraps of ideas, so that you can turn them into something useful later.
I don’t stop taking notes when I’m writing — in fact, that only increases as the book starts to take shape and really live in my brain. But the place I spent the most time focused on deliberate, actual writing was in iA Writer, my minimal, zero-frills word processor of choice. This was the software I opened when I sat down to do the exhausting work of novel writing.
I’ve tried a handful of other apps, but this is the one I keep returning to, even though it costs $50 for mobile and another $50 if you want the desktop version. Looking back, this is a pretty ludicrous amount of money to spend just because I like the app’s default typeface. (Though, when you’re going to spend over 100 hours looking at something, $100 seems less egregious.) There’s a sea of free apps that accomplish the very basic task of letting you type, so find the one that makes you feel the most comfortable. The first draft is the hardest part, so anything you can do to ease that process is worth it.
I drafted almost entirely on an iPad — not any of the high-end models, but Apple’s entry-level one with the crummy keyboard attachment. I just wanted a device dedicated to being a writing tool. (I wrote my first book on a Chromebook that was too slow to meaningfully browse the internet; eventually, I had to send it to the e-waste pickup when it was too sluggish to open Google Docs.) On the iPad, I removed most of the default apps, and the only other things I installed were the Kindle app and some PDF readers. No games, no streaming services. 
I know some writers that work from start to finish. I’m a little more chaotic in that I write in absolutely no order. This becomes a problem later, since the most important part of a narrative is structure. So at a certain point, when I had enough words written (usually around 60,000 words), I moved things into several different Google Docs so I could start to separate out scenes and chapters. If iA Writer is for getting words on the page, Docs is where I finish and begin to revise a book. This is where it becomes a legible story.
I don’t have too much to say about Google Docs that you don’t already know. It’s the word processor that I’ve used the most throughout my life, so it’s also the most familiar and most convenient. We use Google Docs all day long at The Verge, so writing a book in it also makes it feel like work, which is an admission in a way: that now, we have to do work.
The use of AI, especially when it comes to writing, is controversial for a myriad of good reasons. I know a lot of authors that wholesale reject the use of them. I don’t personally feel that they are immoral; I mostly find them quite unhelpful. For my work at The Verge, I find myself testing them somewhat regularly just to know what’s out there. (I do think AI is quite useful for rough language translation.) 
Just as Microsoft Word was designed for business memos, the incentive of AI-generated writing is to produce copious amounts of banal web copy or cheery emails. I’m not interested in using AI to generate any of my work because, frankly, I like doing the work. Making art, as Ted Chiang has argued, is a series of decisions. The convenience of AI is that it makes decisions for you. But then, really, what is the point of writing if you let something else do it for you?
This was when things got a little weird. Google Docs has a hard time with writing that goes over a certain length — that threshold, I’ve found, is around 15,000 words. So my book was separated into large sections, and I created an index linked to all the chapters, also as a Google Doc. By this point, I’m off the iPad and back on a laptop; my browser has tabs open to each of the seven separate Docs that comprise my draft.
For me, revising isn’t as hard as finishing a first draft, but it is an organizational challenge. On one hand, you have to keep balancing things on a sentence, paragraph, and chapter level; on the other, you can’t lose sight of the book’s entire structure. Having the manuscript spread across so many different documents was proving cumbersome.
So I installed Scrivener, one of the few apps I know that is actually built with book writing in mind. (What does it say that the majority of the creative writing we do is done in software designed for the workplace?) If the ideal of software in the past decade has been ease, Scrivener leans the other direction by designing something for power users. It’s software that you get more out of the more effort you put into setting it up, making it your own, and wrangling its eccentricities until the quirks feel like second nature. Even the way Scrivener looks — the use of multiple panes, rigid organization structures, and high information density — feels like Windows software from the late ‘90s / early aughts. 
I confess, I only did light customization (the first thing I did was switch all the UI elements to a better typeface). Even then, it was quite worthwhile to use the app to organize and reorganize chapters. With the customizable metadata fields, I was able to create labels to easily sort chapters by characters’ points of view and track which sections needed revisions. Scrivener also lets you visualize your projects, and seeing everything laid out visually like index cards on a corkboard is extremely helpful when you’re trying to weave together five plot lines. It really helped me nail down the book’s sequence and structure.
The thing is: I actually hate writing in Scrivener, so then I moved everything back to Google Docs to finish (again, scattered across several different Docs). I did another round of revisions with my agent, and then sent it off to my editor, exported as a Word document.
As much as I find Microsoft Word quite clumsy, especially on a Mac, it became necessary to eventually move a full manuscript there. Word is the industry standard for the publishing industry, and I wasn’t about to ask my editor to accommodate my desire for a less ugly word processor. (It also seems like no matter how long Google tries to solve its interoperability with Word’s track changes, crucial things always end up getting lost in translation.)
After a couple rounds with my editor, we finally felt like the manuscript was good to go to production. First, it went to the copy editor. This started in Word, but then the book’s interior was laid out and I had to look at proofs in Adobe Acrobat, which has its own gangly commenting system that I endured because all authors are brave.
A lot of time passes while a book is in production, and then you start to have meetings about actually selling the book. This is my least favorite part of the publishing process, since I’m forced to think about publicity and marketing, and I’m not sure anyone chooses writing fiction because their desire is to “please a market.”
Anyway, one last app that I’ve been using — at David Pierce’s recommendation — is Craft 3. The previous versions of Craft, which I’d never used, were full-featured productivity apps. This third iteration pivots it to a writing environment first, with lots of productivity bells and whistles second. This has been the ideal to manage all of my pre-publication commitments, which involve writing marketing copy, planning events, and scheduling interviews. With Craft, I’ve had a pretty easy time staying on top of deadlines, and I’ve found it less fidgety than similar tools like Notion.
So, if you’ve been keeping track, the journey looks like this:
Bear / Apple Notes ➡️ iA Writer ➡️ Google Docs ➡️ Scrivener ➡️ Google Docs ➡️ Microsoft Word ➡️ Adobe Acrobat
There are a few things all these apps have in common. First, they all have reliable phone and desktop versions. I don’t use each one equally, but it’s nice to have access to the text no matter where I’m working. Second, each piece of software is built around a core strength, rather than trying to be good at everything. Scrivener is the only outlier here, since it suffers from feature bloat, but you can also really make it work for you if you put in the elbow grease. (There’s a whole subculture of Scrivener users and tinkerers — multiple friends have recommended Jaime Greene’s online courses.)
I have a third book under contract, which means I’m committed to doing this whole process all over again. Well, not this process, exactly — if I’ve learned anything, it’s that I’ll have to reinvent the whole thing for myself as I write, and that means trying a lot of new software. Even if it was possible to create the perfect app, one that could capture the journey of writing a book from conception to publication, I’m still not sure I would use it. The limitations of each tool forced me to be thoughtful. The friction made me ask, at every turn: what does the book need now?
A workflow is for getting things done efficiently. Embracing mess is how you write a book.

Bitcoin and crypto prices have been rocked by U.S. president Donald Trump’s barrage of tariffs—with the Federal Reserve poised to blow up the bitcoin price.

The bitcoin price dropped sharply after China sparked fears of a “crisis scenario” but has bounced back, breaking its correlation with the stock market.
Now, as the chief executive of BlackRock calls bitcoin potentially a “safer bet” than the U.S. dollar, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has declared bitcoin an emerging “store of value”—comparing it to gold.

U.S. president Donald Trump and Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent attended a White House bitcoin ... More and crypto summit in March ahead of extreme bitcoin price volatility and a looming stock market crash.
“Bitcoin is becoming a store of value, gold’s has historically been a store of value,” Bessent told podcaster Tucker Carlson, adding there are “a lot of different stores of value over time.”
Bessent’s comments come as stock markets around the world fall sharply in the aftermath of Trump’s so-called Liberation Day of trade tariffs that saw the U.S. implement a global baseline import tax of 10% and much higher rates for goods from dozens of countries.
“As risk assets continue to sell off, investors may increasingly rotate into traditional hedges like bonds and gold—or into bitcoin, which has shown notable resilience relative to equities in recent days,"" David Hernandez, crypto investment specialist at bitcoin and crypto investment company 21Shares, said via email.
Gold, a traditional safe haven asset, is up around 15% so far this year as traders and central banks buy it to hedge against economic and geopolitical uncertainties.
“Bitcoin’s price action this week has been a true testament to its investment case as an emerging store of value and potential for uncorrelated returns,"" Hernandez said.
The U.S. stock market has plummeted by around 10% since Trump followed through with his well-telegraphed global tariff regime that was more aggressive than traders had anticipated.
Trump himself shared a social media post with a caption reading: “Trump is purposely crashing the market.""
The bitcoin price has, however, climbed over the course of the week, breaking its recent correlation with the stock market—specifically the tech heavy Nasdaq and the so-called Magnificent 7 stocks that includes Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia and Tesla.

The bitcoin price has dropped in recent weeks but has outperformed the ""crashing"" stock market.
""What’s happening with the market I’d say it’s more a Mag 7 problem, not a MAGA problem,"" Bessent told Carlson, referring to the Trump administration’s Make American Great Again series of policies that are focuses on rebuilding the country’s manufacturing base.
“The Trump tariffs have unleashed volatility, notably shaking the U.S. equity markets, but with this, bitcoin’s unique reaction deserves attention,” Joe Burnett, director of market research crypto financial company Unchained, said in emailed comments.
""Recalling March 2020, bitcoin rapidly bottomed and recovered first (before U.S. equities), a pattern potentially repeating today as bitcoin hasn’t made new lows since March 11th. This resilience could signal a strategic entry point for long-term investors. Of course, if stocks continue falling aggressively over the coming weeks, it’s reasonable to expect that bitcoin could experience another leg down too.”"

My day at an autonomous vehicle conference in Los Angeles started in a human-driven Uber.

        On a Wednesday morning, Waymo said it would take at least 15 minutes to snag a car for a five-minute ride to NeueHouse Hollywood, where Ride AI was hosting its first-ever autonomous vehicle summit, featuring some of the sector's leading players.
    

        I wasn't particularly in a time crunch, but, like most people, I don't call a rideshare driver half an hour or more before I leave the house to get to a destination.
    

        Exit app. Open Uber.
    

        It's fair to say that, at least for now, the battle between human and robot drivers is still raging.
    

        Stephen Hayes, Lyft's VP of autonomous operations, and Ryan Green, CEO of Gridwise — a platform for rideshare drivers to track their earnings — both said at the conference that the future of ride-hailing will look like a hybrid market of human and robot drivers.
    

        Green estimated that that'll be the case for at least the next 10 to 15 years.
    

        It may be Hayes' and Green's prerogative to make such a claim. But that outlook made perfect sense to me — even as someone who has had great experiences in a Waymo — and appeared to resonate throughout the summit.
    

Toyota Research Institute CEO Gill Pratt jumpstarted the event as the first speaker to say it's a ""myth that we need autonomy to help with terrible human driving.""
    

        ""Humans are actually reasonably safe, pretty good drivers. For every hundred million miles there's an accident,"" AvinashBalachandran, TRI's VP of the Human Interacting Driving division, told me. ""Where we really see value for autonomy is this ability to help drivers in situations where they tend to struggle.""
    

        For a conference centered entirely on the future of autonomous mobility, I was surprised that some of the top players in the AV field weren't throwing out rosy pictures or estimates of when robots will take over the wheel and our city roads.
    

        Tesla, whose CEO has made wild predictions like one million robotaxis by 2020, was noticeably absent from the conference but still came up during panel talks.
    

        Instead, voices from various autonomous mobility players, from ride-hailing to OEM software providers, spoke on the challenges of perfecting full self-driving technology and the still-fresh business opportunities for the human-driven vehicle segment.
    

        Amnon Shashua, CEO of Mobileye, talked about the lack of ""precision"" in AI, stemming partly from the need to perfect the application of redundancies and a lack of data.
    

        Over at Wayve, a UK-based autonomous driving software company, Kaity Fischer, the VP of commercial and operations, talked about the ""very large untapped market"" oflevel two and level threeassisted and autonomous driving systems for consumer vehicles.
    

        Both levels still need humans behind the wheel but with varying degrees of driver input.
    

        ""For the foreseeable future, there'll be a very long period of time where it's a hybrid solution of vehicle ownership intermingled with varying levels of autonomy, and those things all need to be able to coexist,"" Fisher told me when I asked her what she thought city streetswill look like decades down the line. ""So levels two, three, and four all need to be able to share a space on the road and operate safely in conjunction.""
    

        Christoph Ltge, an economist and AI ethics expert at the Technical University of Munich, told me that in Germany, where robotaxis exist only for limited testing, Level 3 driving is still not widely implemented.
    

        ""It should have happened already, but it's not really happening,"" he said.
    

        This is not to underestimate the progress folks in San Francisco and other markets haveexperienced firsthand. One of the reasons everyone gathered in Los Angeles for an autonomous vehicle conference is undoubtedly because of Waymo.
    

        As Sophia Tung, a former engineer and now an AV-focused content creator, told me, we've seen an autonomous vehicle hype cycle before — this time's just a bit different.
    

        Timothy B. Lee, one of the Ride AI moderators who has reported on transportation for Ars Technica before launching his Substack, Understanding AI, pointed to the Gartner hype cycle: Technological innovation first comes with the skyrocketing of what's called peak ""inflated expectations"" before crashing into a ""trough of disillusionment,"" then rising again, more gradually, on a ""slope of enlightenment"" followed by a ""plateau of productivity.""
    

        The peak of inflated expectations happened around 2016 or '17, Lee told me, before an Uber autonomous test vehicle killed a woman in Tempe, Arizona, in 2018.
    

        ""Then there was a period of three or four years, from 2018 to 2022 or so, when things were going very badly for these companies,"" he said. ""You had Uber shut down their program, Lyft shut down their program. Ford had Argo (AI) that shut down. That was a bad time to be in the industry and not as much fun to cover. And then, the last two years I would say it's been on the upswing pretty much since Waymo started expanding to San Francisco.""
    

        Lee's prognosis is that the great human-driver replacement will be gradual. In the next 20-plus years, city roads will see fewer human drivers before they completely disappear.
    

        For example, he cited the decades it took before automatic elevators made human elevator operators obsolete.
    

        ""There's going to be a long process,"" he said.
    

        My day in Los Angeles ended with another human-driven rideshare, which arrived in the same amount of time it took to say goodbye to my friends, put on my shoes, and walk out of their apartment.
    

        The closest Waymo was 13 minutes away.
    

        Exit app. Open Uber.

Elon Musk on Saturday defended the White House DOGE Office, arguing that the task force is ""extremely transparent."" Musk has faced a growing backlash over his work to reshape the federal government.

        ""We're very transparent with the Department of Government Efficiency,"" Musk told Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini virtually at a meeting of Italy's League Party.
    

        ""Any action that we make, we post on the doge.gov website, and we post on our X account, so it's extreme transparency,"" he said.
    

        Musk described the challenges he's faced while implementing President Donald Trump's vision of a leaner government.
    

        ""It's very difficult to reduce the size of the bureaucracy and government spending,"" he said. ""It comes with immense opposition, even when the things that we are cutting make no sense at all.""
    

        ""We're only cutting the most obvious terrible expenses that make no sense,"" he said. ""Nonetheless, we get attacked like crazy.""
    

        Since its formation in January, DOGE staffers have upended myriad departments and agencies, from the Departments of Treasury and State to the Social Security Administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and USAID.
    

        A new report from the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that DOGE's actions have led to over 216,000 firings throughout the federal workforce.
    

        Pushback against Musk and DOGE, meanwhile, has swelled among the general public. Nationwide protests — called the ""Tesla Takedown"" — targeted the company he leads last week. At the nationwide anti-Trump demonstrations this weekend, Musk was again the focus of many protesters.
    

        Musk's influence may be waning amid the growing backlash. On Tuesday, he suffered a major political loss as Susan Crawford, the Democratic-backed candidate in the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, easily defeated conservative judge Brad Schimel. Musk's America PAC poured millions into the race to support Schimel.
    

        This week was also a highly consequential one for Trump, as the president on Wednesday rolled out his ""reciprocal"" tariffs on dozens of trading partners — which has drawn broad criticism and caused one of the worst market sell-offs in recent memory.
    

        Notably, while speaking with Salvini on Saturday, Musk said he wanted to see a ""zero-tariff"" system between the United States and Europe, a surprising break from the rhetoric coming from the Trump White House.
    

        ""I hope it's agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America,"" Musk said. ""That's what I hope occurs.""

Richard Langley (Dean Haglund), Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood), and John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood) — collectively known as the Lone Gunmen — first appeared in the episode of ""The X-Files"" called ""E.B.E."" (February 18, 1994). They were a trio of very, very intense nerds who spent their days looking into conspiracy theories, often finding (specious) evidence for their existence. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) also investigated conspiracies, and would occasionally turn to the Lone Gunmen to give his investigations credibility. The Gunmen, however, were comic relief characters, presented as an over-the-top counterpart to Mulder. No matter how wild Mulder got with his talk of aliens, monsters, and government cover-ups, the Gunmen outstripped him in paranoia and conspiratorial hypotheses. 
The Gunmen appeared in 40 episodes of ""The X-Files"" overall (including in the weird latter-day revival seasons), and many fans loved them. They were a whimsical warning of what Fox Mulder might become, if he allowed to lose himself in conspiracy theories. The Gunmen had actual espionage skills, of course, but no actual cool. They were capable and awkward at the same time. They provided a marvelous break to the usual funereal tone of ""The X-Files."" 
They also had their own spinoff TV series in 2001, and it was a gigantic flop. ""The Lone Gunmen"" ran on Fox from March 4 to June 1, lasting only 13 episodes before being canceled. Some ""X-Files"" fans tuned in, of course — there were certainly enough X-Philes in 2001 — but a ""sillier"" version of a sci-fi series best known for its foggy-skies earnestness wasn't well-received. The show was canceled merely because no one was tuning in. Show co-creator Vince Gilligan has been asked about ""The Lone Gunmen"" several times over the years, and he chalks up the show's failure to bad timing; he's actually very proud of the show. 


In a 2015 with the ""X-Files"" fan page ""The X-Files Lexicon,"" Gilligan was asked what lessons he might have taken from the short-lived nature of ""The Lone Gunmen,"" and he said that there were no lessons to learn. He loved what he did, and felt that he nailed the series from episode one. He said: 
""I have such fondness for 'The Lone Gunmen.' I think it ended way too soon. I was crushed when 'The Lone Gunmen' got canceled after its first season. What did I learn from doing that program? I get a fair number of people asking 'What are you going to do differently?' and the answer is I wouldn't do anything differently. 'The Lone Gunmen' to this day is a show I'm still proud of, and I will always be proud of."" 
He then posited that ""you can't really tell in advance whether a show is going to work for an audience,"" saying that the timing was bad. But he didn't think, for a second, that ""The Lone Gunmen"" was a bad show. He reiterated his viewpoint in a Time Magazine interview from that same year. In that interview, he said timing TV is like timing the stock market: it can't be done. 
If anything, the tone was off. ""The Lone Gunmen"" was, overall, a comedy series. The three lead characters (Haglund, Braidwood, and Harwood all returned) were awkward and funny, and investigated conspiracies, often with a strange, whimsical bent. Unlike ""The X-Files,"" there wasn't a supernatural element to ""The Lone Gunmen,"" sticking closer to terrorist conspiracies, government cover-ups, and illegal surveillance. They were joined by a none-too-bright, handsome ""hero"" type named Jimmy Bond (Stephen Snedden), and a wiser, graceful Carmen Sandiego-like rival named Yves Adele Harlow (Zuleikha Robinson). Note that ""Yves Adele Harlow"" is an anagram for ""Lee Harvey Oswald."" 


""The Lone Gunmen"" wasn't a bit hit in its time, sadly, but it was released on DVD. Sadly, the show ended up being somewhat cursed by an especially bad bit of timing. In the show's pilot episode — which aired in March of 2001 — the titular trio find a conspiracy involving rogue members of the U.S. government attempting to hijack an airplane. The rogue terrorists then planned on flying the plane into the World Trade Center towers in New York. The idea was, once the Towers were knocked down, unaffiliated terrorist groups would be blamed, and a brand-new War on Terror would henceforth be initiated, allowing the government to retain the war apparatuses they built during the Cold War. 
The climax of the pilot episode involved the Gunmen sitting on one of the planes as it barrelled toward a World Trade Tower. They were able to change the plane's course at the last minute. 
""The Lone Gunmen"" proved to be weirdly prescient, of course. Only six months after the episode aired, the World Trade Towers were destroyed by actual hijackers. Then, in the following months, the George W. Bush administration did indeed initiate a War on Terror that raged for decades. Not only was ""The Lone Gunmen"" a flop in its initial run, but the odd, violent coincidences of its pilot episode left the series stained for the better part of a decade; surely no network would want to run a 9/11 episode for at least a decade. 
In 2025, however, maybe enough time has passed, and audiences will be ready to discover the series again. ""The Lone Gunmen"" was a strange footnote to ""The X-Files,"" but it was a quality series with a tone all its own. "

NEW YORK — President Donald Trump has unveiled his latest tariffs, and they could have significant implications for your wallet.
Trump's sweeping new tariffs, on top of previous levies and retaliation worldwide, are expected to increase prices for everyday items. The trade wars have already roiled financial markets and plunged businesses into uncertainty — all while economists warn of potentially weakened economic growth and heightened inequality.

Which impacts will be felt by consumers and workers first? And what can households do in the face of so much uncertainty? Here's what you need to know:
Tariffs are taxes on goods imported from other countries. Companies buying foreign products pay the tariffs imposed on them — and, as a result, face higher costs that are typically passed on to customers.
Trump has argued tariffs will protect U.S. industries from unfair foreign competition and raise money for the federal government. But since so much of what we buy today relies on a global supply chain, steeper tariffs mean you'll likely see more expensive prices from the grocery aisle to your next car repair.
“It is going to affect everything in the economy,” said Josh Stillwagon, an associate professor of economics and chair of the Economics Division at Babson College. “There’s this immediate price increase that’s going to be passed on to consumers here, basically as soon as the retailers have to buy new product.”
No. Experts warn that these tariffs could escalate inequities. Low-income families in particular will feel the costs of key necessities, like food and energy, rise with fewer savings to draw on — significantly straining budgets.
Low-income households often ""spend a larger share of their income on essential goods — whether it's food or other basic products ... (like) soap or toothpaste,"" said Gustavo Flores-Macías, a professor of government and public policy at Cornell University whose research focuses on economic development. Because of this, he said, “even relatively small price increases"" will have disproportionate impacts.
Evidence of that disparity will only mount for big-ticket items. Dipanjan Chatterjee, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester, points to now-imposed auto tariffs, explaining that projected price hikes of thousands of dollars for a new imported car will be easier for those with larger salaries to absorb.
“That tax is more severe for people who earn less money,"" said Chatterjee. ""So it’s a regressive tax.”
Beyond more immediate price pressures, experts also warn that tariffs could contribute to unemployment or lower incomes down the road. Trump has argued that tariffs will bring manufacturing back to the U.S., but if businesses take profit hits or change their supply sources, there could be layoffs worldwide.
“It’s not just the price aspect and purchasing power decreasing,” said Flores-Macías. “As tariffs start to work their way through the economy .... low-income families' jobs often will be the first to go. And those sectors of the population are most vulnerable.”
Economist Susan Helper, former senior adviser for industrial strategy at the White House Office of Management and Budget, said that there are some cases where tariffs could raise wages, but this doesn't look likely to be one of them.
“There isn't enough certainty for businesses to invest and create new and better jobs,"" she said. ""It takes a few years at minimum to profit off a new facility or factory, and I don’t think people have the confidence that the tariffs will be stable enough that they will have a return on that investment.”
The tariffs announced by Trump Wednesday, on top of other levies that are already in effect, tax imports from nearly all of America's trading partners. And U.S. shoppers currently rely on a lot of goods made abroad.
Fruits and vegetables, your next phone purchase, a pharmacy order, new clothes, or a trip to a mechanic who uses auto parts made outside of the U.S. could all be impacted.
The timing of when prices will go up comes down to inventory, Stillwagon said. Much of that will also depend on how businesses prepare and respond to the new levies. While companies may have stocked up on goods in anticipation of these tariffs, he expects some stores to see more immediate price increases.
Prices on perishable groceries will likely increase first, because supermarket inventories need to be replenished more frequently. But a range of other items — like electronics, household appliances, clothing and footwear — could also be affected in the coming weeks and months.
“Annual losses for households at the bottom of the income distribution are estimated to be $980 under the April 2 policy alone,” according to John Breyault, vice president of public policy, telecom and fraud at the National Consumers League, who cited an analysis from the Budget Lab at Yale. He said that tariffs will disproportionately affect clothing and textiles, with apparel prices predicted to rise 17%.
Consumers are also likely to feel the pinch of tariffs in home buying, Breyault said. The new taxes on building materials are estimated to increase the average costs of a new home by $9,200, according to an analysis by the National Association of Home Builders.
Rerouting supply chains to reemphasize domestic production is also very complex — and could take years. Stillwagon said there are some products, like bananas and coffee, that the U.S. simply can't substitute to the same scale of production other countries provide. And even for goods that can be made in the U.S., there will still likely be inflation.
“A real worry here is that this won’t just be a one-time price jump,” he said.
For products like coffee, Helper predicts people will likely absorb costs, while changing their shopping choices when it comes to other products.
“I guess you could switch to Coca-Cola if all you want is the caffeine,” she said, lightly. “It will probably be good for California wines.”
Stocking up on what you know you need is a start — but with limits.
“If there are things that you’re buying on a consistent basis — week to week, month to month — I think it’s not a bad idea to try to stock up in advance,” Stillwagon said. But it's important to avoid panic buying like that seen at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, he and others added. That could cause shortages to emerge sooner and prices to go up faster.
You also don't want to buy a bunch of items that will eventually go to waste.
“If you do plan stock up on consumables, make sure you have a plan on how to store them properly so you don’t end up having to throw out that 20-pound bag of shrimp, for example, in a few weeks,"" said Breyault.
It may also be time to look for substitutes. From electronics to clothing, Flores-Macías says that there could be more affordable secondhand or refurbished options to turn to. And Chatterjee noted consumers may want to start comparing prices of name-brands versus “private,” or generic, labels in major retailers. Others may turn to at-home solutions, he said, such as growing their own vegetables.
Overall, experts say you'll need to evaluate your budget and consumption habits for the road ahead.
“This is not a hurricane that’s going to be around for seven days and everything goes back to normal afterward. And you stock up on toilet paper (temporarily),"" said Chatterjee. ""For all you know, this thing could be around until a different administration comes in and changes trade policy.”
Consumers should be on the lookout for even greater use of so-called “shrinkflation” on the grocery aisle, according to Breyault. Shrinkflation is a tactic consumer goods manufacturers use to hide cost increases by changing the design of packaging.
“Consumers can prepare for the inflation that the tariffs are likely to exacerbate by getting into the habit of checking the unit price of items on the grocery shelf,"" said Breyault. “While not all states require it, where it is required, consumers can more easily compare the per unit price of one item — cereal, for example — to another item.”

41,2025-04-05,"The Fab Four came together on stage this week for an all-star Beatles announcement that left some of the internet swooning.
No, Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr aren't reuniting through AI for a joint album with Taylor Swift.
Instead, the 60s rock 'n' roll icons will be played by four leading heartthrobs of the moment: Paul Mescal (McCartney), Harris Dickinson (Lennon), Joseph Quinn (Harrison) and Barry Keoghan (Starr), in a big-screen quadrilogy directed by Sir Sam Mendes - all set for release in 2028.
Each actor fits the mould of ""the internet's boyfriends"" - a term defined by Glamour magazine as ""a famous or semi-famous male person whom your entire Twitter feed has a crush on at the same time"".
When Sir Sam walked out on stage with his ""band"" at Las Vegas' CinemaCon on Tuesday, the message was clear.
If 1960s Beatlemania was defined by teenage girls fainting and screaming, the plan now is arguably to get Gen Z - in internet parlance  - ""screaming, crying, throwing up"" from behind their phone screens in excitement.
""Each star brings their own brand of modern-day hysteria,"" says The Standard's celebrity correspondent Lisa McLoughlin, ""the kind fuelled by social media virality and fan video edits"".
This is particularly true of Mescal, whose ""popularity mirrors a smidge the frenzy the Beatles once sparked"".
After shooting to fame in 2020's BBC adaptation of Normal People, the Irishman scored an Oscar nomination as a tormented father in Aftersun, before finding blockbuster status in Gladiator II - rising from indie heartbreaker to Hollywood heartthrob.
Similar is true of fellow Irishman Keoghan. Also Oscar-nominated for Banshees of Inisherin, he embraced rugged sex symbol status in last year's cult hit Saltburn.
Dickinson and Quinn are earlier in their trajectory, but still burning bright - the former recently starring alongside Nicole Kidman in erotic thriller Babygirl and the latter turning heads in Netflix's Stranger Things.
McLoughlin describes the casting as ""logical and predictable"" - a strategic move as the band look to secure their legacy with a new generation, while studios grapple with the ambition of luring streaming era, post-Covid, audiences back to the cinema not once, but four times in close proximity.
The timing and scope of the project sums up the Beatles' unique heritage as the best-selling band of all-time - the catalyst for shifting youth culture and the boundaries of pop.
It's been 56 years since all four members last recorded together. Lennon was shot dead just over a decade later at 40, while Harrison died of cancer in 2001, aged 58. The two surviving Beatles, Sir Paul and Sir Ringo, are now into their 80s.
And yet, as the band's only official biographer Hunter Davies told Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday: ""The strange thing about the Beatles is that the longer we get from them, the bigger they become"".
Recent years have seen Sir Paul seemingly work to bookend the Beatles' music - becoming Glastonbury's oldest ever headliner at 80, before driving the 2023 release of Now and Then, a ""final"" Beatles track rebuilt from Lennon's demo vocals. It became the band's 18th UK number one single, over five decades from their last, and won a Grammy.
The forthcoming biopics appear to be a way of continuing this on the big screen. 
Four years on from Peter Jackson's sprawling Get Back docuseries, this is the first time that all four band members and their estates have granted full life story and music rights for a scripted film.
The casting reflects the distinct identities and histories of the members, each offering something different to lovelorn girls and copycat boys so intoxicated by Beatlemania.
McLoughlin feels the choices ""make commercial sense"" as the perfect foil for an audience now two generations removed from the original Beatlemania. 
""They all have dedicated younger fan bases (many of whom may not be regular cinema-goers or deeply connected to the Beatles), acting credibility and experience leading or co-leading major productions"".
Each film will focus on an individual member of the band. ""They intersect in different ways - sometimes overlapping, sometimes not,"" Sir Sam explained.
""They're four very different human beings. Perhaps this is a chance to understand them a little more deeply.""
The Barbenheimer phenomenon of summer 2023 highlighted the increasing influence online audience reactions hold on cultural currency.
It also turbocharged Hollywood's acceptance of ""event cinema"" as a way to lure younger audiences. A generation that Warner Bros Discovery's executive director Vera Chien previously told Forbes, already see the streaming-social media relationship as the norm.
Sir Sam's four-film schedule plays into this. It's aimed at creating what Sony executive Tom Rothman described as ""the first bingeable theatrical experience"".
""Frankly, we need big cinematic events to get people out of the house,"" Sir Sam said.
Films can now develop distinct digital identities through audience projection, as seen by the viral success of Saltburn.
The makers of the Beatles biopics are arguably betting on its cast of ""internet boyfriends"" pulling younger audiences - without the same nostalgic attachment to the Beatles - engaged on social media and, executives hope, looking up from phone screen to big screen.
The extent to which musical performances will feature is unknown.
But the Beatle biopics could capitalise on the booming money-spinning genre that's found awards success over the past decade. . 
It's also proven fertile heartthrob ground, with the Beatles cast following Jacob Elordi and Austin Butler's turns as Elvis, alongside Timothee Chalamet's Oscar-nominated take as Bob Dylan in A Complete Unknown.
Still, there are risks, says Dade Hayes, business writer at Deadline and co-author of Binge Times.
He says that whilst he commends Rothman's ""clever handle"" and the cinephile in him values the biopics' ""bold statement about the value of cinemas and communal viewing,"" market realities present cautionary signs.
First, the UK box office is yet to fully bounce back from the pandemic, whilst US takings are more than 20% below pre-Covid levels. ""If people aren't dying to return at regular intervals to cinemas,"" says Hayes, ""then you are holding an expensive set of assets that are hard to monetise"".
And a multi-release strategy relies on the ""fuse being lit with the first instalment"", Hayes says.
He points to Kevin Costner's Horizon films, originally envisioned as a multi-part theatrical franchise, only to flounder once the first instalment tanked, as an example of the dangers.
For McLoughlin, the three-year gap between the casting announcement and 2028 release date adds further risk, especially in the fast-moving online space where fanbases can shift.
But beyond industry dynamics there's also a cast talking point much closer to home.
The Beatles biopics, celebrating four Scouse lads who conquered the world and put Liverpool on the map, will not feature any local talent in the lead roles.
As one Liverpudlian put it in a TikTok video liked over 200,000 times: ""I love Mescal as much as the next gal but [the lack of representation] is breaking my heart"".
McLoughlin agrees, pointing out that James Corden last week urged the TV industry to be ""bolder"" and back ideas that ""might scare you a little."" She feels film studios should do the same.
""The Beatles themselves were unknown until they weren't,"" she says. ""This could have been a chance for a newcomer to have their own Beatles moment - rising from obscurity in real-time"".
And perhaps the biggest missed opportunity of all McLoughlin adds, is the failure to put Liverpudlian actors front and centre in a Beatles biopic. ""The band is Liverpool's greatest cultural export, yet the city's deep talent pool was completely overlooked,"" she adds.
Social media, meanwhile, is already awash with doubt over Keoghan's ability to deliver a consistent Scouse accent, questioning his attempts in Saltburn.
Still, as Hunter Davies put it, the Beatles have long been more than just a local band. They keep growing. 
Way back in 1966, Lennon infamously described them as bigger than Jesus. Over five decades on, the studio behind the four films - and perhaps cinema in general - is no doubt banking on a Beatlemania revival.
Shows including Doctor Who and Black Mirror are to return, as videogame South of Midnight is released.
The plans include the erection of temporary structures and up to 14 concerts each summer.
The singer has won thousands of new fans on the Sabrina Carpenter tour, seven years into her career. 
The Welsh National Opera programme is aimed at people living with persistent pain.
She has performed with musicians including Foo Fighters and Lenny Kravitz.

        A day after President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on nearly a hundred countries, companies in the US and abroad are already making big moves as the stock market continues its free fall:Nintendo delayed Switch 2 preorders. The timing of the tariffs couldn’t have been much worse…
    "
43,2025-04-05,"Business Insider Edition 
This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Scott Kunes, COO of Kunes Auto Group, which operates about 30 auto dealerships in Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Kunes spoke to Business Insider on Wednesday, the day President Donald Trump announced new tariffs on various goods, including autos and auto parts. BI verified his identity and role at the business.

The interview has been edited for length and clarity.


        This last week has actually been a really good week for the auto industry in general. The National Automobile Dealers Association put out an estimate that industry sales are up 14% month-over-month just in the last week as the tariffs came to fruition.
    

        We did see a rush for people to purchase vehicles and get ahead of the tariff issue. We're seeing that short-term sales bump but are also planning for the future.
    

        Pre-pandemic, the standard for dealers was to have a 90-day supply of many cars. Then, we pushed for a 60-day-or-less supply depending on the manufacturer and the make and model.
    

        Right now, we are trying to get as much supply as we possibly can — but not getting overextended.
    

        Everybody looks at import manufacturers like Honda or Toyota and says, ""Well, these are the ones that are going to get the tariffs put on them."" That's not actually the case: Hyundai, for example, is in a terrific position, with a lot of its major models being manufactured here in the United States.
    

        We're definitely looking at our parts supply chain as well. We do a large wholesale business in parts, especially in the body business. Some of those things might be affected, like body panels. We're just trying to make sure that we have the stock and can weather this as long as possible.
    

        Obviously, the entire country experienced inflation over the past four years, but the auto industry experienced it quite a bit more.
    

        But recently, consumers were starting to get a bit of a break with lower interest rates, prices coming down, manufacturers offering heavier incentives because demand was down, leasing coming back very strongly, and lower payment possibilities.
    

        Now, we have another thing that jumps in and starts to get everybody scared again.
    

        These tariffs are going to affect consumers in both the new and used markets.
    

        I think a lot of dealers kind of figured out a playbook during the supply chain crisis during and after the pandemic. There was a pivot from new vehicles to used vehicles. We saw three-year-old vehicles transacting higher than what they were purchased.
    

        Some used-car lots are buying vehicles and fixing them very cheaply using parts that might be made in China. So, these tariffs are actually going to affect those lower-end price-range vehicles.
    

        We don't know if these tariffs are going to last a month or for years. And will prices rise dramatically? Some of the manufacturers have talked about eating some of the costs.
    

        Ultimately, I think most of us in the auto industry look at the tariffs and some of the bargaining that is going on as a positive thing for the United States auto industry in the long run. They'll boost US manufacturing in general, though it is going to hurt in the short term.
    

        But as auto dealers, we always try to evolve. We're going to try to find ways to make sure that we're still selling vehicles and that we're still meeting our consumers' needs and demands.

A lot happened this week, and NPR has you covered. Catch up on the big news and culture moments you might have missed.
We spoke to Sen. Cory Booker after his record-breaking speech on the Senate floor; Elizabeth Olsen played a game of Wild Card and opened up about something she feels she still needs to prove; and we spoke to several experts on the things that matter most, whether that's how to reduce screen time or how women may have to pay more in the tariff wars.
On Monday evening, Sen. Cory Booker stood on the Senate floor and began a speech criticizing the Trump administration. The New Jersey Democrat kept talking and talking — through the night and into the next day — for 25 hours and 5 minutes.
His effort, which involved dozens of fellow Senate Democrats asking questions to relieve his speaking burden, set a record for the longest speech on record in the chamber. It surpassed the previous record set in 1957 by segregationist Sen. Strom Thurmond, who filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes to oppose the Civil Rights Act. He spoke to All Things Considered after the speech.

In Death of a Unicorn, actors Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega play a father and daughter driving deep into the wilderness when they hit a unicorn. Thoughtful, but gruesome is an apt descriptor for the film as well. As it turns out, hitting a unicorn isn't quite like hitting a squirrel. The unicorns in this film are a lot more vengeful and organized. What starts out as a dark comedy turns into a unicorn gore-fest.

  Why women may pay more in the tariff wars At the beginning of the year, we talked about how No-Buy January, buying secondhand and mending old clothes seemed to be taking hold amongst some of the most popular influencers — even though the guiding principle of underconsumption is something we've been doing for a long time. Then, President Trump started implementing tariffs on China, Mexico and Canada — and now even the European Union. That made us think: How would fast fashion be affected by this? And would underconsumption move from a hashtag to a lifestyle? To find out, The Indicator's Wailin Wong joins It's Been A Minute to break down how tariffs will affect Americans who love to shop ... when the prices drop.

				(Mis)Uses of Technology			

Israel-located NSO Group may no longer be a malware option for the US and other discerning governments around the world, thanks to blacklists, lawsuits, and its disturbing willingness to sell to some of the most abhorrent governments of earth. But the market for powerful phone exploits isn’t dying up. Governments still want powerful surveillance tech, even if it means buying from the same market NSO Group almost ruined.
Paragon — formed by a former Israeli intelligence officer, and which currently has ex-Israel prime minister Ehud Barak on its board — is the new option, one even US agencies are willing to approach. Not that Paragon is necessarily that much more ethical than NSO. But, for now, its malware has only been traced to countries that most people wouldn’t consider to be habitual human rights abusers. This is from Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai’s report for TechCrunch, which sums up the discoveries made by Toronto’s Citizen Lab, which has led the world in exposures of abusive deployments of NSO Group spyware. 
The governments of Australia, Canada, Cyprus, Denmark, Israel, and Singapore are likely customers of Israeli spyware maker Paragon Solutions, according to a new technical report by a renowned digital security lab.
On Wednesday, The Citizen Lab, a group of academics and security researchers housed at the University of Toronto that has investigated the spyware industry for more than a decade, published a report about the Israeli-founded surveillance startup, identifying the six governments as “suspected Paragon deployments.”
It’s not that none of these governments are problem-free. Australia has always erred on the side of mass surveillance, encryption-breaking mandates, and ends-justifies-the-means thinking. Cyprus has spent plenty of years acting as an offshore conduit for malware sales to UN-blacklisted nations by setting up shell entities to handle the contractual work that would otherwise be illegal in malware companies’ home countries. Israel is malware central, with much of its homegrown exploit products being created by companies founded by former Israeli intelligence officers and analysts. Singapore has its own problems with control, corporal punishment, and domestic surveillance, even if it manages to offset these encroachments with a strong economy, actually safe and extremely clean streets, and a wealth of robust social services. And Denmark is Denmark, a country that rarely makes the wrong kind of headlines, outside of its bizarre takes on copyright law and its firm resistance to Greenland real estate deals.
Then there’s Canada. Canada’s government has also recently been pushing for more domestic surveillance, less oversight, and even engaged in some conversations about encryption backdoors. Still, it’s usually mostly harmless. But even though the Ontario Provincial Police don’t want to talk about their Paragon purchases, it’s pretty much impossible for the OPP to pretend this hasn’t actually happened. This is from Justin Ling’s op-ed for the Toronto Star, which calls out the OPP for its acquisition of Paragon spyware, as well as its lack of transparency about its use of Paragon’s products: 
The Citizen Lab first uncovered Paragon’s operation when a tip led them to a domain name registered to the company, which in turn led to a server that the Citizen Lab says it believes Paragon uses to communicate with clients. Researchers then tracked that server to small town Ontario, to an address which matches only a warehouse, a strip mall, a brewery, an apartment — and the headquarters of the Ontario Provincial Police.
So, there’s no chance of plausible deniability, which explains the OPP’s statement that says nothing more than it won’t talk about its investigative tools in public. 
But that’s not the end of the discussion. It’s more than a little concerning when a free world police agency decides it can be trusted with powerful malware that it then deploys against its fellow Canadians. 
When cops deploy this cutting-edge technology without disclosure, or firm rules in place, they risk violating the public’s trust. That problem is only more acute when it comes to technology that risks collecting data on innocent people — like spyware. While adopting new tech can help police solve crimes, failing to fully disclose the nature of these new techniques risks getting evidence thrown out at trial on procedural grounds.
[…]
Even if the police are operating ethically, the same vulnerabilities they’re exploiting could put you at risk.
This is the trade-off the general public often isn’t aware is being made in its name, but without its consent: that cops will buy from companies that hoard exploits and refuse to inform the millions of innocent people affected by them of their existence simply because doing so might make it slightly more difficult for them to target and track suspected criminals. Meanwhile, active criminals are no doubt using the same undisclosed exploits to cause more harm. And that’s on top of any abuse of this spyware that’s being perpetuated by the governments that have purchased these products. 
As Citizen Lab notes, there’s no way to “abuse-proof” powerful malware. As if to prove this point, reports surfaced last month showing an unknown government had been targeting Italian human rights activists. (This would seem to point to Cyprus, which has been a facilitator of abuse on behalf of countries trying to distance themselves from the consequences of their actions, but nothing has been confirmed at this point.) 
Beppe Caccia, one of the co-founders of Mediterranea Saving Humans, an Italian non-government organization that helps immigrants, told TechCrunch that he had been targeted by the spyware campaign. 
Caccia disclosed he was targeted after another one of his organization’s co-founders, Luca Casarini, said publicly last week that he had also received a notification from WhatsApp alerting him to the suspected spyware attack.
To assume the Ontario Provincial Police can be trusted with this powerful malware is foolish. All it takes is one person with access to violate whatever trust is left by using it for personal or political reasons. One of the few deterrents is robust oversight, which should always be accompanied by proactive transparency. If cops want powerful spyware, they should be expected to fully justify its deployment over less-intrusive forms of surveillance. And it should never be allowed to purchase or deploy this tech without stringent guidelines in place or prior to a period of public comment. Trust has to be earned. It’s not enough to just buy stuff from a company that has yet to prove it’s any better than the company it’s replacing.

And nothing will be done about this, because no one will ever stop the encroaching mass-surveilance.
Nobody with the task to uphold human rights are doing anything.
And with much of the tech sector turning out to be extremely fascism-friendly, it’s just going to get worse.
Just an endless boot smearing out the face of humanity forever, since nobody listens to civil rights unions anymore.
Why would they? The last guy who said he’d make it stop decided it was actually pretty cool and he wanted to do it more. And no one’s complained about it ever since until now when the fascists aren’t bothering to hide who they are anymore.
You get the government you tolerate.
Funny, Denmark wants to be able to AI-analyze and collect basically all data they can about their citizens soon, too. Already planning on getting it set up by July 1st.
Combined with this and the ProtectEU thing (and chat control), I think the fight for privacy is lost forever, globally.

  This is the trade-off the general public often isn’t aware is being made in its name, but without its consent: that cops will buy from companies that hoard exploits and refuse to inform the millions of innocent people affected by them of their existence simply because doing so might make it slightly more difficult for them to target and track suspected criminals.

This is like refusing to develop a vaccine because there’s a slight chance the disease might kill a criminal for you.
Or maybe like: refusing to make a vaccine (researched, and developed mostly/entirely on someone else’s dime) to some places because the profit margin in not high enough.
Canadian law enforcement is notorious for spying on indigenous people, muslims, student groups, and activist groups, especially indigenous activists, so I’m completely unsurprised tbh. the only surprise is that someone figured it out.

    Expect to pay more for everything but experts warn against panic-buying if it leads to debt.
  
New tariffs on imports could mean you'll soon have to pay more for electronics.
President Donald Trump's new sweeping tariffs on US imports sparked fears of trade wars and threatened to raise prices on everything we buy, including Apple products. 
The cost of the latest tech seems to rise every year but experts warn that smartphone and laptop prices could climb even higher because of the massive tariffs this year. 
In addition to imposing tariffs on goods from nearly 200 countries, Trump announced this week that he was adding a 34% tariff to goods from China, where Apple produces the majority of its products. He had already increased tariff rates on China by 20% since February.  
Experts predict that the cumulative 54% tariff hike will raise prices for products manufactured in China, including iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and AirPods. But it's unclear exactly how much of an impact it will actually have on prices.
""Expect 20% to 40% higher prices, although demand could plummet,"" Patti Brennan, certified financial planner and CEO of Key Financial, said in an email. ""If or when that happens, prices could fall.""
Others say Apple could absorb more costs early on to stay competitive with the rest of the tech market.
""The tariffs could increase Apple product prices by about 10% in the coming months, which could lead to price increases of $50 to $150 on higher-end products like the iPhone Pro Max models and MacBook Pros,"" Stephan Shipe, a certified financial planner and CEO of Scholar Financial Advising, said in an email. 
Best Buy and Target warned consumers last month to expect higher prices for everything, after the latest round of tariffs went into effect. February's tariff hike had already prompted Acer to announce that it was raising prices on its laptops. 
If you're in the market for a new Apple device or an imported gaming system, like the Nintendo Switch 2 or PlayStation 5 Pro, here's how tariffs could raise prices, and what you should do to prepare.
Trump announced a 10% baseline tariff on all imports plus ""reciprocal tariffs"" on imports from more than 180 countries April 2, which he dubbed ""Liberation Day."" He's long touted tariffs as a way to even the trade deficit and raise revenue to offset tax cuts, although many economists say that tariffs could lead to higher prices and may end up hurting the US economy. US stock prices have plummeted since Trump's announcement as markets reacted poorly to the sweeping tariffs.
Trump has taken an especially hard stance on China, which was already subject to tariffs that Trump ordered during his first term in office. The latest round of tariffs means prices for these goods could rise even higher. China has responded to each round of tariffs with its own set of tariffs on US products, including coal, crude oil and farm products such as chicken, beef, soybeans, wheat and pork. 
Tariffs, in theory, are designed to financially impact other countries because their goods are being taxed. Tariffs are paid by the US company importing the product, and this upcharge is usually -- but not always -- passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices.
Tariffs levied on products from China -- and everywhere else -- will likely translate into higher prices for consumers. That means the tech you use every day, like imported smartphones, tablets, laptops, TVs and kitchen appliances, could get even more expensive this year.
If the full cost is passed on to shoppers, we'd see a 54% increase in prices on Apple products produced in China. Apple has moved some of its production to other countries, including India, Malaysia and Vietnam. But they were each hit with their own tariffs yesterday -- Vietnam saw a 46% tariff hike. Apple also sources components for its products from a long list of countries, all now facing new tariffs.
If Apple did raise its prices in direct proportion to this year's Chinese tariff hikes, the iPhone 16, which starts at $830 at T-Mobile, could jump up to $1,278. You can get a 15-inch MacBook Air starting at $1,199 on Amazon; a 54% hike would raise the base price to $1,846.
However, a tariff on goods doesn't necessarily mean prices will go up by the same amount. If companies want to stay competitive, they could absorb some of the costs to keep their prices lower. 
Apple announced a $100 price cut on its new MacBook Air last month, a day after the last round of tariffs took effect. In what was widely viewed as an attempt to persuade Trump to ""carve out"" an exemption from the latest tariffs, Apple announced in February that it would spend more than $500 billion in the next four years to expand manufacturing operations in the US.
""They already committed $500 billion to US manufacturing, and there was no carve out for Apple,"" Brennan said. ""They will have to pass along most of these costs to consumers.""

If you were planning on buying a new iPhone, gaming console, MacBook or other tech, buying it now could save you money.
But if you don't have the cash on hand and plan to use a credit card or buy now, pay later plan just to avoid tariffs, experts say to make sure you have the money to cover the costs before you start accruing interest. With credit cards' average interest rates currently more than 20%, the cost of financing a big purchase could quickly wipe out any savings you'd get by buying before prices go up because of tariffs.
""The decision to buy would depend on immediate need vs. a tolerance for a small potential price increase,"" Shipe said.
One way to save on Apple products, even if prices go up, is to buy last year's model instead of the newest release.
""If you aren't planning to upgrade in the next year, there is no need to rush out to buy a new smartphone,"" Shawn DuBravac, chief economist at IPC, a manufacturing trade association, said in an email. ""Technology is naturally deflationary, meaning that over time performance goes up and prices generally go down for products of similar quality."""

The Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Ryzen 9 9950X3D were billed as the fastest gaming CPUs available, bringing stacked cache improvements and performance leaps over their non-X3D counterparts. However, the launch buzz was quickly overshadowed by an emerging technical crisis.
Within weeks of release, early adopters began reporting fatal CPU issues online. Systems built with the new Ryzen 7 9800X3D, often running at stock settings, would shut down unexpectedly and refuse to power back on. Unlike typical overheating or instability scenarios, these failures were terminal: CPUs stopped posting altogether, motherboards were rendered unusable, and in many cases, physical signs of damage were evident.
The situation escalated in February 2025 when a Reddit user, natty_overlord, began compiling failure reports in a centralized megathread. His crowd-sourced spreadsheet eventually logged over 100 separate cases, mostly involving the 9800X3D. By analyzing the data, a majority of the failed CPUs were paired with ASRock motherboards, with the X670E and B650E chipsets particularly implicated. While ASRock became the focus, the pattern suggested broader compatibility and stability issues across the AM5 ecosystem.
By March, the issue gained widespread attention in the tech community. It wasn’t just enthusiasts noticing anymore—industry watchers, retailers, and motherboard vendors began taking notice. Adding to the trouble, there were reports of power delivery-related damage to the boards themselves, with burned VRM components and scorched CPU contact pads showing up in post-mortem photos shared by affected users.
While no single root cause has been officially confirmed, a consensus has formed around several likely contributing factors.
At the core of the issue is the electrical sensitivity of AMD’s 3D V-Cache chips. The stacked cache structure significantly boosts gaming performance by increasing L3 cache capacity, but it also introduces design constraints—most notably, a much lower voltage tolerance. AMD has documented that these CPUs should not exceed 1.3V for long-term operation. Anything above that threshold risks damaging the fragile interconnects between the chiplet and the cache die.
Unfortunately, many AM5 motherboards—especially with early BIOS revisions—were delivering voltages above this safe zone, either due to aggressive power behavior or poor EXPO memory profile implementation. EXPO (Extended Profiles for Overclocking) is AMD’s answer to Intel XMP, allowing for easy memory tuning, but it can introduce unintended voltage boosts to the CPU SoC or core if not tightly managed.
ASRock’s boards, in particular, seemed to lack sufficient voltage restraints in their default firmware settings, leading to overshoots during boot or under load. This may have been compounded by poor VRM thermal performance or less precise power monitoring compared to premium boards from competitors.
Adding to the complexity is the possibility of user-related errors. MSI, for example, investigated two Ryzen 9800X3D deaths on its MAG X870 TOMAHAWK WIFI and concluded that improper CPU seating may have led to uneven thermal contact and localized overheating. While not a universal cause, this suggests that even minor deviations in installation — such as uneven cooler mounting pressure — could further stress these already sensitive chips.
​AMD has officially addressed the reported failures of Ryzen 7 9800X3D processors, attributing the issues primarily to memory compatibility problems in earlier BIOS versions, particularly on ASRock AM5 motherboards. A joint investigation by AMD and ASRock identified that these early BIOS versions could lead to system instability and, in some cases, prevent the system from completing the Power-On Self-Test (POST). AMD recommends that users update their BIOS to the latest version to resolve these issues and advises contacting customer support if problems persist. ​
While ASRock motherboards were predominantly affected, similar problems were reported with Asus, MSI, and Gigabyte boards, indicating that the issue may not be exclusive to a single manufacturer. ​
In response, ASRock has released BIOS updates aimed at addressing these memory compatibility issues. AMD continues to investigate the root cause of the failures and emphasizes the importance of keeping system firmware up to date to ensure stability and compatibility. ​
For current owners of the Ryzen 9800X3D or 9950X3D, caution is essential. The first step is ensuring that the motherboard is running the latest BIOS version. These updates often include voltage cap fixes, improved EXPO handling, and more conservative power delivery behavior—all critical for chip longevity.
Secondly, users should be extremely cautious with enabling EXPO profiles, even if the RAM kit supports it. Unless the motherboard vendor has explicitly validated EXPO on your board/CPU combo, it’s safer to stick to JEDEC standard memory settings.
Manual overclocking or voltage tweaking should be avoided entirely for 3D V-Cache chips. Monitoring tools like HWiNFO64 or Ryzen Master can help users keep an eye on Vcore and SoC voltages in real time. Spikes above 1.3V, even momentarily, should be taken seriously and may indicate that additional firmware tuning or cooling is needed.
When building a new system with these chips, installation precision is also critical. Use a high-quality cooler with even mounting pressure, double-check CPU socket alignment, and avoid excessive thermal paste that could interfere with socket contacts.
Finally, if a system begins exhibiting instability, sudden shutdowns, or no-POST behavior—especially after enabling EXPO—it’s best to power down and investigate before further damage occurs. A proactive approach may save the CPU and board before irreversible harm is done.
The Ryzen 9800X3D and 9950X3D represent the bleeding edge of consumer CPU design. Their unmatched gaming performance is a marvel of engineering, but they demand precision and caution. The failures seen over the past five months highlight the fragility of such cutting-edge hardware when platform-level tuning isn’t perfect.
Without an official fix or comment from AMD, users are left navigating a landscape of firmware patches, speculation, and community support threads. While most systems will likely run just fine with the latest updates, the risk—even if rare—remains a lingering cloud over what should have been a milestone generation for AMD.
Shots fired. Frank Azor, an AMD executive, just straight-up called Intel's Arrow Lake line of CPUs ""horrible."" Where did it all start? Why, with the ongoing shortage of AMD’s best gaming processors, of course. And surprisingly, AMD blames Intel for the fact that its X3D processors are hard to come by right now.
In a recent media roundtable reported by Tom's Hardware, AMD admitted that it never expected the demand for its CPUs to be that high. In fact, it expected it to be lower because it thought that Intel would be more competitive -- but since Arrow Lake turned out to be largely unimpressive, people turned to AMD for their next-gen CPUs even more so than before.
At this point, AMD has been on top when we're talking about the best processors for gaming, but it still took CES 2025 to do a victory lap and extend its lead. Opening up the keynote address, AMD revealed the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, both of which will be available in the first quarter of this year.
The performance here doesn't sway things much, as AMD has already claimed the top slot for gaming processors with its wildly popular Ryzen 7 9800X3D. As you can see below, however, AMD claims an 8% lead over last-gen's Ryzen 9 7950X3D on average after testing 40 games. Unsurprisingly, graphically intensive games like Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora and Black Myth: Wukong see little benefit, but AMD is claiming a lead as large as 58% in a game like Counter-Strike 2. 
AMD just announced over a dozen new laptop CPUs, which will appear in over 150 new laptops being announced at CES 2025 and later this year, including a new 3D V-Cache chip for gaming laptops and some really impressive graphics in its new Ryzen AI Max+ halo chips.
Let's start with Fire Range. These chips are for high-end gaming laptops, a successor to Dragon Range line, catering to enthusiast gamers and, so far, only enthusiasts are going to be happy, as those laptops likely be quite expensive. On the other hand, the CPUs sound mighty powerful. The lineup includes, first and foremost, the next big 3D V-Cache chip, dubbed the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D.

56,2025-04-05,"Former Trump economic advisor Larry Kudlow ignored the pain being inflicted on the country by Trump's horrific tariffs and used the stock market destruction to promote his love of tax cuts.
This is Disaster Capitalism at its worst.
Kudlow opened his program  by having Jerry Willis highlight the damage Trump's tariffs had done. While she went through every segment that was in the red, Kudlow offered no opinions. He was mute. 
Kudlow was waiting in the wings like a filthy hyena to spring his latest moronic idea on his viewers.  
With a straight face he said, ""How about a tariff dividend for taxpayers?""
WTF?

KUDLOW: President Trump's trade reciprocity policy is, in my judgment, exactly the right approach to level the playing field and fight the predatory export policies from so many of our so-called trading partners.

The US economy was booming before Trump took office, but reality is not allowed in the MAGAverse.
Kudlow then went on to project what he hoped companies might do facing this crisis.
""Now the White House is estimating that the increase in American tariff charges could yield roughly 600 billion dollars a year,"" he said..
Wow, Kudlow did admit that some economists believe Trump is weakening the economy, but he has a solution. Tax cuts!

KUDLOW: So here's a solution. There's more than enough tariff revenue to lower taxes. Take that 600 billion in tariff charges and turn it over to taxpayers.
And please do it right away.
Now this idea of a tariff dividend, as I'm calling it, a tariff dividend for taxpayers is not yet part of the one big, beautiful bill circulating through the House and Senate because, well, it was only yesterday that President Trump unveiled his plan.
For example, collapse the bottom three tax brackets, income tax brackets of 10, 12 and 22 percent into maybe a 15 percent tax rate with a very high income threshold, maybe reaching a hundred thousand bucks.
Then take the middle brackets of 24, 32 and 35, collapse that into one bracket, maybe around 28 percent.
That might reach all the way up to four or five hundred thousand dollars.
While they're at it, cut the made in America corporate rate all the way down to perhaps 10 percent or even less.
And make sure that top personal income tax rate is dropped to around 35 percent, if not lower.

Kudlow sees the only opportunity to pass Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy is by having Trump's tariffs destroy the economy and the stock market so they can use fear to motivate Congress to pass these measures.
Whenever stock markets, job markets and the overall US economy is good under a Democratic president, he tries to find any sliver in any specific market to attack and undermine it.
These jackals care not for 99% of this country. 
Larry Kudlow is a soulless economic predator of the worst kind.

57,2025-04-05,"Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana admitted that Trump's global tariffs have not been good for the country and if it doesn't change soon Trump has to recalibrate.
That was surprising. 
Fox News host Harris Faulkner soft-peddled her first question to the faux folksy senator by claiming Demented Donald is asking for a little bit of time. The market is not going to make up 5000 points in a week. We are not talking about days, or months, it may take years to get back what he's already given up on a whim. Seniors and many Americans do not have that kind of time when they depend on the 401K's investments and Social Security to live on. 
Kennedy opened by saying pig Trump's goals are laudable and then offered some reality. ( I didn't even bother commenting on Harris Faulkner because she's a useful idiot for Trump)

KENNEDY: But the stock market does matter. About 62% of Americans have money in the market. The wealth effect is real– there’s reliable data that shows that for every one dollar that the stock market, holdings in the stock market go down, people spend twenty-five cents less. 
Well, we’re a consumer-driven economy and if people are spending less, that’s gonna affect your GDP.
So I’m not going to bubble wrap it. What’s happening is not good. Now will it continue? Will we find the bottom and then it will start to go back up? I hope so. That’s what I’m pulling for. But if it doesn’t, we’ll have to recalibrate.

It is good to hear some complaining by Republicans, but the country needs more. 
If we take Trump at his word, he has no intention of reversing course on his devastating tariffs.
 Is  Kennedy willing to join Democrats and have Congress step up to curtail Trump's megalomania?
 Will he help make Congress do their jobs and reign in Trump's madness?

There are specific foods that have been shown to help reduce sugar cravings. Keeping these foods on hand can be beneficial if you're aiming to cut back on sugar.
The good news? None of these foods are fancy; they're all readily available at your local supermarket.
Yes, berries are a fruit, but they crush your cravings not due to their sweetness but to other benefits they provide. Berries contain a ton of fiber and are considered low GI. This, in turn, creates a low-level insulin spike compared to other fruits that contain high sugar content.
Including berries in your meals and dishes can help curb a natural sweet tooth. Berries also have a high water content when compared to other fruits and can aid in hydration. Finally, berries contain polyphenols. Polyphenols have been linked to decreasing inflammation in the gut lining1, which can be harmed through sugar addiction and keep people addicted.
By decreasing this inflammation, you can overcome a sugar craving and, further down the line, a sugar addiction.
Including berries in things like homemade sauces, unsweetened iced tea, or as a fun yogurt bowl topping can help you stay hydrated and kick your cravings.
Avocados, like berries, are a standout fruit because they have proved that the combination of fat and fiber can also be a hunger-crusher.
In a clinical trial2, avocados were substituted for carbohydrate-dense, low-fat breakfast ingredients. The trial found that the satiety hormones in the brain were more prevalent after consuming the avocado versus the high-carb meal.
This can prevent sugar cravings by reducing the overall feelings of hunger. We don't crave something sweet when we are fully nourished by monounsaturated fats and fiber—found in avocado!
Not an avocado fan? Try blending them into a pesto, smoothie, or dressing to get a creamy texture and all of the benefits.
For decades, it has been known that nut consumption can help improve our health, including lowering cardiometabolic markers and BMI3.
Pistachios can, therefore, displace the need for sweets and promote an overall healthy dietary pattern. They're packed with protein, which is an important factor when addressing sugar addiction. Protein is made up of amino acids, which can build the pathways in our brain that stop sugar addiction.
When the neurotransmitter levels and hormones in the brain are functioning properly, they will be deterred from wanting unhealthy food options like soda and candy.
One study showed that regular pistachio consumption4 was associated with weight loss and other cardiometabolic health benefits, including lower blood pressure, and best of all, it was also shown to reduce intake of sweets!
So, grab a handful of pistachios next time you feel a sugar craving coming on, or build your own sugar-free trail mix using pistachios and other on-the-go foods such as cacao nibs.
Chia seeds are full of essential fatty acids that fuel our body and its pathways. They are also a complete plant protein, containing all nine essential amino acids. This is important because it means these seeds are of high biological value (HBV). HBV proteins are easier for our bodies to absorb and utilize and therefore control sugar cravings.
Finally, chia seeds have a lipid profile5 that has been proven to prevent blood glucose spikes and improve blood lipid profiles.
This can also benefit those with a sugar addiction because of the long-lasting effects chia seeds have on the entire body, not just one area or system. Chia seeds are a great way to sneak up on a craving.
Sprinkling them on top of toasted bread with a little cream cheese, in oatmeal, or all alone in chia pudding can taste great and stop cravings in their tracks.
Legumes in general are a staple in the diets of some of the healthiest populations worldwide, including the Mediterranean. Legumes are filled with fiber and plant-based protein.
The overall nutritional components of chickpeas make them a great choice for overcoming sugar addiction. They have little flavor and are very versatile while still packing a total of 18 to 22 g of fiber per 100 g of chickpeas.
Fiber is split into insoluble and soluble categories. Chickpeas contain both kinds of fiber, making them beneficial to the overall gut microbiome diversification. Having a diverse gut microbiome can improve cravings along the gut-brain connection and signal hunger and fullness to the brain at a more efficient rate.
Oats are a whole-grain powerhouse. They contain fast-digesting and slow-digesting carbohydrates that provide your body with a boost of energy and prevent fatigue. Fatigue is one of the leading causes of sugar cravings. When we are tired, our body craves fast-digesting energy (like sugar).
Oats contain a soluble dietary fiber called beta-glucan. Beta-glucan has been shown to reduce postprandial (after-feeding) glucose values as well as cholesterol. This can help our bodies break away from sugar addiction and maintain a healthy biochemical state. Oats can be added to many different meals to replace white flour!
Thicken up a sauce or stew using oat flour by blending oats in your blender or food processor until fine.
The polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) found in olives, when combined with carbohydrate intake, have been shown to regulate our glucose-insulin homeostasis. But how is this important when trying to break a sugar addiction?
Our bodies utilize glucose as our main energy source. While glucose is a good thing to have around, glucose that lingers in our bloodstream is problematic. Insulin comes in to help by signaling to the body that it's time to absorb the glucose from our blood into our cells.
Homeostasis between these mechanisms is crucial when evaluating insulin resistance, which is a common condition among those who consume too much sugar in their diets. PUFAs are also beneficial for heart health and overall longevity6. Think tapenades, cheese boards, and salad additives to spice up your meals using olives.
Sweet potatoes have almost the same macronutrients as regular white potatoes, but they stand out because of their micronutrient content. Sweet potatoes contain an inactive form of vitamin A known as carotenoids. Carotenoids have the power to improve our cognitive function over time7.
They can also prevent diseases of lifestyle, including eye issues and cancer8, but the real sugar-rewiring power they hold comes from our brains.
Our brains utilize neurostimulation and hormones to affect our mood and daily function. Sugar stimulates dopamine or the happy neurochemical. Vitamin A can help combat this by reducing sugar cravings and regulating the release of dopamine.
Sweet potatoes are an easy side dish when baked, or a vehicle for protein. Keeping roasted sweet potatoes prepared for a week's worth of meals can save you time and sugar cravings.
Unsweetened Greek yogurt is packed with protein and a great replacement for normally high-fat condiments and ingredients like sour cream. The protein in Greek yogurt is a complete protein and is known for keeping us satiated for long periods of time and therefore prevents sugar binges at night.
One meta-analysis looked at the effects of protein on appetite and found that meals containing complete proteins increase fullness ratings more than lower-protein meals. This, in turn, influences BMI and metabolic syndrome. Incorporating more Greek yogurt into your cooking can allow for less sugar in the long run.
A go-to snack can be fresh veggie dip using Greek yogurt and seasonings.
Spirulina is a nutritional powerhouse alga that is dried into a bright green powder for consumption. It contains multiple vitamins and minerals, and there is also evidence to support its role in reducing appetite and blood lipid levels.
Spirulina was used in a placebo-controlled study to see its effect on appetite and lipid profiling. The findings showed significantly reduced appetite when the participants consumed 1 g per day of spirulina in their diets.
By reducing overall appetite, your body no longer craves the high blood glucose spike that is satisfied by sugary foods and the uncontrollable eating aspects sugar gives to food, and therefore you won't feel the need to consume sugar.
You can add some spirulina to your smoothie for a boost of nutrition and a little help with lessening those sugar cravings. You can also disguise spirulina in spreads, such as mashed avocado, and condiments such as mayo and ketchup!

With the Nintendo Switch 2, it looks like Nintendo is finally catching up with its peers like PlayStation and Xbox. That’s not just about 4K visuals and 120fps framerates. For example, Nintendo finally has a unified account system, letting players carry over their original Switch purchases over to the upcoming console. Nintendo’s previous consoles and handhelds all had siloed digital purchases.
The Switch 2 also has its own form of voice chat called GameChat, which lets players speak with their friends and other players online. Unified account systems and internal voice chats are features that Xbox and PlayStation figured out in the 2000s and 2010s, but at least for Nintendo, it’s better late than never.
Even though Nintendo is adopting features that its competitors have for years and is showing signs of modernization, there’s still one small thing missing for me: an Achievement system.
Microsoft originally pioneered the modern achievement system, which lets players unlock badges on their Xbox profiles by completing certain objectives in each of their games. It was such a popular engagement feature that PlayStation and Steam followed suit and created their own equivalent versions in the form of PlayStation Trophies and Steam Achievements.
For some reason, Nintendo never got on that train. With the Switch 2’s unveiling, there were many players, myself included, who were hoping that Nintendo would finally get on board and create its own system-wide accolade system. At this point, it seems like it never will, at least in the way I’m hoping.
Some games on Switch 2 have in-game achievements, and that acts like a workaround for the lack of a system-wide achievement system. The upcoming Mario Kart World appears to include one based on a detail viewers noticed during a Nintendo Treehouse demo. It’s not like this is a new initiative. Xenoblade Chronicles X on the Wii U had in-game achievements, and so did its Definitive Edition remaster on Switch. However, it’s still not a satisfying replacement for a full-fledged achievement system that I can show off online and boast about my gamer cred.
Achievement hunters are a minority in the gaming community, but they still drive engagement and cause some to stick around a game for much longer. Achievements are a fantastic way to motivate players to check out a single-player game’s post-game content or keep a multiplayer game’s player base steady.
In the big picture, the lack of a system-wide achievement system won’t spell doom for Switch 2. If it did, that would only be a bonus and Nintendo wouldn’t lose its unique identity within the video game market. The bigger problem is how Nintendo is straddling the line between catching up with its competitors while also doing its own thing.
It’s a question of future-proofing. This transition between Switch to Switch 2 is, in some ways, the first time Nintendo has felt like it has the future in mind. 4K visuals, DLSS support, and more make this feel like an entirely different company than the one we’ve seen over the last few generations. On the flipside, there are still remaining traces of that old company poking through.
Possibly passing on a system-wide achievement system is one of the small places where you can trace that. Nintendo laid the groundwork for its unified online system with the Switch, and now it’s finally bearing fruit. It could’ve hopped onto the boat and implemented an achievement system back in 2017, but chose not to. The Switch 2 would’ve been the second best time to do it.
Even back in 2017, the Switch still used the antiquated Friend Code feature instead of just being able to search someone up in an online database. While Nintendo hasn’t confirmed whether Friend Codes are still being used for Switch 2, the verbiage on its website indicates that they’ll be returning. That would leave it awkwardly between something modern and dated.
Will there be internal capability for native streaming, which PlayStation and Xbox can do without the use of a capture card? Will apps like Netflix come to the console finally? What do the system’s confirmed eshop improvements actually look like? These are questions that we didn’t get an answer to during the Direct and we don’t have reason to be optimistic.
Nintendo’s attempt at catching up, while still maintaining its unique identity, has created a conundrum for Switch 2. It’s more powerful, which will help games run better, and the internal voice chat at least proves that Nintendo wants to be on par with its competitors in the features department. The Joy-Con mouse functionality is like the Legion Go’s ability for players to use the right controller as a mouse. Nintendo knows it now has competition in the handheld market with systems like the Steam Deck and has to innovate in order to keep up.
But Nintendo’s hesitance to adopt certain features could hold Switch 2 back. The hardware is certainly advanced, which is expected for a successor, but the wider ecosystem still seems lacking at a glance. It’s unclear if Nintendo will meet those expectations. At a premium price of $450, I expect a premium product, and Nintendo’s mixed messaging on Switch 2 falls a bit short so far.
Nintendo’s big Switch 2 Direct was full of left-field announcements. Kirby Air Ride is returning, another Hyrule Warriors game came out of nowhere, and FromSoftware unveiled a multiplayer spiritual sequel to Bloodborne that’s exclusive to Switch 2 (something that still sounds like a joke when I write it out). For me, though, the biggest surprise was the stream’s final announcement. It did not end with the next 3D Mario game as many anticipated; the last game revealed was Donkey Kong Bananza, the ape’s first 3D game in decades.
It was the very definition of a “pleasant surprise,” and one that left me eager to know more. I wouldn’t have to wait long for that. Shortly following the presentation, I went hands on with the Nintendo Switch 2 and several games coming for it. Donkey Kong Bananza was, surprisingly, on that list. In a 20-minute demo, I got to wreak havoc as DK, destroying everything in sight with my ground-pounding fists. It was the loudest and proudest demo I played out of nearly a dozen games -- 20-minutes of sensory overload chaos that left my head spinning.
After years of waiting, we finally know a whole lot more about the Nintendo Switch 2. In a Direct presentation on Wednesday morning, Nintendo revealed a host of highly requested features coming to its latest console, from 4K support to significantly expanded storage. Even with all of that clarity and detail, seeing -- and playing -- is believing with a new console. And after actually playing the Nintendo Switch 2, I’d say I’m a believer.
Following the showcase, I went hands on with Nintendo’s new console. I demoed several games, from Mario Kart World to Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, as well as third-party heavy hitters like Split Fiction and Cyberpunk 2077. From that wide range of demos, I was sold on the tech upgrade here, which brings the Switch 2 more in line with the Steam Deck.
When the Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, it’ll be placing a lot of pressure on one game: Mario Kart World. The racing game is set to be this console generation’s Breath of the Wild, with a statement entry in one of Nintendo’s biggest franchises. The company is so sure about its success, in fact, that it’s charging $80 for it, an eye-popping number that has not gone over well with fans so far. If Mario Kart World is going to overcome that financial burden, it has to be really, really good.
And you probably won’t be surprised to hear that it is. I went hands-on with Mario Kart World at a Nintendo Switch 2 demo event, giving me a deep dive into its open-world pivot, elimination mode, and more. Everything I played was a delight from gaming’s most reliable multiplayer series, but on a much bigger scale. Though I did have a blast with it, the price tag does have me now thinking twice about just how much I enjoyed my races. It’s fun, but fun enough to justify the not so insignificant chunk it would take out of my paycheck? I’m not sure that I’m confident enough to make that judgement yet, and that’s not a great sign for Nintendo’s bold price experiment.

President Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on nearly every country sent the stock market plunging this week and ignited anxiety about the future of the economy.
SCOTT SIMON, HOST:  It's been just a few dizzying days since President Donald Trump announced an expansive new round of tariffs on goods from nearly all countries.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed and the day that we began to make America wealthy again.(CHEERING)TRUMP: Going to make it wealthy, good and wealthy.SIMON: The country's wealth, as indicated by the U.S. stock market, has sharply declined. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 2,200 points yesterday after falling 1,600 points the day before. NPR senior contributor Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: President said things were going very well while the stock market dropped. He referred to the economy as a sick patient who'd been through an operation. A lot of people don't seem to share his assessment right now.ELVING: I do think a lot of people would agree with that one word, sick. They're feeling that way right now, especially those who lost a lot of their savings this week. For them, the thought of those losses may be more vivid than the golden promise of Trump's high-tariff theory. But as for Trump and his advisers and supporters in Congress and portions of the news media, they're all standing by their confident predictions. They say the retaliation we're seeing from China and elsewhere will be transitory. They say our trading partners will knuckle under and lower their own tariffs. And most important, they say American companies will bring home the jobs that they've shifted overseas and that other countries will shift their manufacturing to the U.S., creating jobs here rather than in their own countries.You know, for weeks now, we've seen the market rising and falling almost daily with each new rumor that tariffs are coming. No, wait. It's all just a bluff. Trump was playing that trombone right up to this week, and there are still those who are suggesting he'll just negotiate it all away in the months ahead. But as of this morning, we have the start of a trade war, and wars are often easier to start than stop.SIMON: Ron, what about the president's contention tariffs will right the wrongs, as he sees it, of U.S. trade policy and bring jobs back to the U.S.?ELVING: That is the heart of the sales pitch, and it has a lot of appeal in the parts of the country that have lost economic vitality since World War II and especially since the 1990s. Smaller communities and rural areas, they'd already seen so many of their young people migrate to the cities and metro areas, and much of what they still had has been lost since the year 2000. And it's easy to blame it all on foreign competition, whether that's the only culprit or not.But the tariffs are just part of Trump's larger effort to redefine the American people - the American role, I should say - in the global order, economically and in every other sense. Trump sees international agreements as weakening to the U.S., and he sees treaties by which the U.S. defends other countries as a bad bargain - a chance for other countries to freeload, whether they can afford to pull their own weight or not. Much of that seems far less about economics and more about political and even personal grievances, Scott.SIMON: What's the reaction in Congress?ELVING: The reaction that matters most is coming from the president's own party, the Republicans. Some of them have been worried for months about Trump's tariff talk, but they defend it as a way to soften up our trading partners. Prior to negotiations, that'll be good for us. They talk about what a savvy negotiator Trump is. But this week we saw several Republican senators backing two efforts to rein in not the threats, but the actual tariffs themselves. One would protect Canada, in particular, and the other would more generally and explicitly assert a role for Congress in setting tariff policy. Now, neither of these has any chance in the House where Trump's hold is still absolute. But the first signs of restiveness in the Senate alone are notable, given the lockstep we've seen in support of Trump's nominees and budget moves in the past, including the most controversial ones.SIMON: Nationwide protests against the Trump administration happening this weekend. Earlier this week, a one-man protest marathon. Senator Cory Booker held the Senate floor and spoke for more than 25 straight hours.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CORY BOOKER: I listen to him. I listen to how he talks about people. We have a government now, as I said earlier, that isn't ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. We have a country now where a president says, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for Donald Trump.SIMON: Senator Booker set a record for floor speeches. No food, water, bathroom breaks. Lot of leg cramps. Did he make a political point, too?ELVING: He did make a political point, partly by breaking a record that had been set by a segregationist senator fighting the civil rights bill back in the 1950s. But the larger meaning for our moment in time is as a kind of alarm bell in the night. Booker was saying this is not just another left-right dispute, another spot - spat between the parties. There are issues here as fundamental as the Constitution itself, the shared powers of the branches and the primacy of Congress. Trump has shown he's willing to bypass Congress, even to question the authority of the courts. So the president and his party have all the levers right now, and he has shown a willingness to push those levers hard.SIMON: Ron Elving, thanks so much.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.

But the first signs of restiveness in the Senate alone are notable, given the lockstep we've seen in support of Trump's nominees and budget moves in the past, including the most controversial ones.SIMON: Nationwide protests against the Trump administration happening this weekend. Earlier this week, a one-man protest marathon. Senator Cory Booker held the Senate floor and spoke for more than 25 straight hours.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CORY BOOKER: I listen to him. I listen to how he talks about people. We have a government now, as I said earlier, that isn't ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. We have a country now where a president says, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for Donald Trump.SIMON: Senator Booker set a record for floor speeches. No food, water, bathroom breaks. Lot of leg cramps. Did he make a political point, too?ELVING: He did make a political point, partly by breaking a record that had been set by a segregationist senator fighting the civil rights bill back in the 1950s. But the larger meaning for our moment in time is as a kind of alarm bell in the night. Booker was saying this is not just another left-right dispute, another spot - spat between the parties. There are issues here as fundamental as the Constitution itself, the shared powers of the branches and the primacy of Congress. Trump has shown he's willing to bypass Congress, even to question the authority of the courts. So the president and his party have all the levers right now, and he has shown a willingness to push those levers hard.SIMON: Ron Elving, thanks so much.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed and the day that we began to make America wealthy again.(CHEERING)TRUMP: Going to make it wealthy, good and wealthy.SIMON: The country's wealth, as indicated by the U.S. stock market, has sharply declined. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 2,200 points yesterday after falling 1,600 points the day before. NPR senior contributor Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: President said things were going very well while the stock market dropped. He referred to the economy as a sick patient who'd been through an operation. A lot of people don't seem to share his assessment right now.ELVING: I do think a lot of people would agree with that one word, sick. They're feeling that way right now, especially those who lost a lot of their savings this week. For them, the thought of those losses may be more vivid than the golden promise of Trump's high-tariff theory. But as for Trump and his advisers and supporters in Congress and portions of the news media, they're all standing by their confident predictions. They say the retaliation we're seeing from China and elsewhere will be transitory. They say our trading partners will knuckle under and lower their own tariffs. And most important, they say American companies will bring home the jobs that they've shifted overseas and that other countries will shift their manufacturing to the U.S., creating jobs here rather than in their own countries.You know, for weeks now, we've seen the market rising and falling almost daily with each new rumor that tariffs are coming. No, wait. It's all just a bluff. Trump was playing that trombone right up to this week, and there are still those who are suggesting he'll just negotiate it all away in the months ahead. But as of this morning, we have the start of a trade war, and wars are often easier to start than stop.SIMON: Ron, what about the president's contention tariffs will right the wrongs, as he sees it, of U.S. trade policy and bring jobs back to the U.S.?ELVING: That is the heart of the sales pitch, and it has a lot of appeal in the parts of the country that have lost economic vitality since World War II and especially since the 1990s. Smaller communities and rural areas, they'd already seen so many of their young people migrate to the cities and metro areas, and much of what they still had has been lost since the year 2000. And it's easy to blame it all on foreign competition, whether that's the only culprit or not.But the tariffs are just part of Trump's larger effort to redefine the American people - the American role, I should say - in the global order, economically and in every other sense. Trump sees international agreements as weakening to the U.S., and he sees treaties by which the U.S. defends other countries as a bad bargain - a chance for other countries to freeload, whether they can afford to pull their own weight or not. Much of that seems far less about economics and more about political and even personal grievances, Scott.SIMON: What's the reaction in Congress?ELVING: The reaction that matters most is coming from the president's own party, the Republicans. Some of them have been worried for months about Trump's tariff talk, but they defend it as a way to soften up our trading partners. Prior to negotiations, that'll be good for us. They talk about what a savvy negotiator Trump is. But this week we saw several Republican senators backing two efforts to rein in not the threats, but the actual tariffs themselves. One would protect Canada, in particular, and the other would more generally and explicitly assert a role for Congress in setting tariff policy. Now, neither of these has any chance in the House where Trump's hold is still absolute.

Some of them have been worried for months about Trump's tariff talk, but they defend it as a way to soften up our trading partners. Prior to negotiations, that'll be good for us. They talk about what a savvy negotiator Trump is. But this week we saw several Republican senators backing two efforts to rein in not the threats, but the actual tariffs themselves. One would protect Canada, in particular, and the other would more generally and explicitly assert a role for Congress in setting tariff policy. Now, neither of these has any chance in the House where Trump's hold is still absolute. But the first signs of restiveness in the Senate alone are notable, given the lockstep we've seen in support of Trump's nominees and budget moves in the past, including the most controversial ones.SIMON: Nationwide protests against the Trump administration happening this weekend. Earlier this week, a one-man protest marathon. Senator Cory Booker held the Senate floor and spoke for more than 25 straight hours.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CORY BOOKER: I listen to him. I listen to how he talks about people. We have a government now, as I said earlier, that isn't ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. We have a country now where a president says, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for Donald Trump.SIMON: Senator Booker set a record for floor speeches. No food, water, bathroom breaks. Lot of leg cramps. Did he make a political point, too?ELVING: He did make a political point, partly by breaking a record that had been set by a segregationist senator fighting the civil rights bill back in the 1950s. But the larger meaning for our moment in time is as a kind of alarm bell in the night. Booker was saying this is not just another left-right dispute, another spot - spat between the parties. There are issues here as fundamental as the Constitution itself, the shared powers of the branches and the primacy of Congress. Trump has shown he's willing to bypass Congress, even to question the authority of the courts. So the president and his party have all the levers right now, and he has shown a willingness to push those levers hard.SIMON: Ron Elving, thanks so much.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.

TRUMP: Going to make it wealthy, good and wealthy.SIMON: The country's wealth, as indicated by the U.S. stock market, has sharply declined. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 2,200 points yesterday after falling 1,600 points the day before. NPR senior contributor Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks for being with us.RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott.SIMON: President said things were going very well while the stock market dropped. He referred to the economy as a sick patient who'd been through an operation. A lot of people don't seem to share his assessment right now.ELVING: I do think a lot of people would agree with that one word, sick. They're feeling that way right now, especially those who lost a lot of their savings this week. For them, the thought of those losses may be more vivid than the golden promise of Trump's high-tariff theory. But as for Trump and his advisers and supporters in Congress and portions of the news media, they're all standing by their confident predictions. They say the retaliation we're seeing from China and elsewhere will be transitory. They say our trading partners will knuckle under and lower their own tariffs. And most important, they say American companies will bring home the jobs that they've shifted overseas and that other countries will shift their manufacturing to the U.S., creating jobs here rather than in their own countries.You know, for weeks now, we've seen the market rising and falling almost daily with each new rumor that tariffs are coming. No, wait. It's all just a bluff. Trump was playing that trombone right up to this week, and there are still those who are suggesting he'll just negotiate it all away in the months ahead. But as of this morning, we have the start of a trade war, and wars are often easier to start than stop.SIMON: Ron, what about the president's contention tariffs will right the wrongs, as he sees it, of U.S. trade policy and bring jobs back to the U.S.?ELVING: That is the heart of the sales pitch, and it has a lot of appeal in the parts of the country that have lost economic vitality since World War II and especially since the 1990s. Smaller communities and rural areas, they'd already seen so many of their young people migrate to the cities and metro areas, and much of what they still had has been lost since the year 2000. And it's easy to blame it all on foreign competition, whether that's the only culprit or not.But the tariffs are just part of Trump's larger effort to redefine the American people - the American role, I should say - in the global order, economically and in every other sense. Trump sees international agreements as weakening to the U.S., and he sees treaties by which the U.S. defends other countries as a bad bargain - a chance for other countries to freeload, whether they can afford to pull their own weight or not.

We have a country now where a president says, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for Donald Trump.SIMON: Senator Booker set a record for floor speeches. No food, water, bathroom breaks. Lot of leg cramps. Did he make a political point, too?ELVING: He did make a political point, partly by breaking a record that had been set by a segregationist senator fighting the civil rights bill back in the 1950s. But the larger meaning for our moment in time is as a kind of alarm bell in the night. Booker was saying this is not just another left-right dispute, another spot - spat between the parties. There are issues here as fundamental as the Constitution itself, the shared powers of the branches and the primacy of Congress. Trump has shown he's willing to bypass Congress, even to question the authority of the courts. So the president and his party have all the levers right now, and he has shown a willingness to push those levers hard.SIMON: Ron Elving, thanks so much.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.

SIMON: President said things were going very well while the stock market dropped. He referred to the economy as a sick patient who'd been through an operation. A lot of people don't seem to share his assessment right now.ELVING: I do think a lot of people would agree with that one word, sick. They're feeling that way right now, especially those who lost a lot of their savings this week. For them, the thought of those losses may be more vivid than the golden promise of Trump's high-tariff theory. But as for Trump and his advisers and supporters in Congress and portions of the news media, they're all standing by their confident predictions. They say the retaliation we're seeing from China and elsewhere will be transitory. They say our trading partners will knuckle under and lower their own tariffs. And most important, they say American companies will bring home the jobs that they've shifted overseas and that other countries will shift their manufacturing to the U.S., creating jobs here rather than in their own countries.You know, for weeks now, we've seen the market rising and falling almost daily with each new rumor that tariffs are coming. No, wait. It's all just a bluff. Trump was playing that trombone right up to this week, and there are still those who are suggesting he'll just negotiate it all away in the months ahead. But as of this morning, we have the start of a trade war, and wars are often easier to start than stop.SIMON: Ron, what about the president's contention tariffs will right the wrongs, as he sees it, of U.S. trade policy and bring jobs back to the U.S.?ELVING: That is the heart of the sales pitch, and it has a lot of appeal in the parts of the country that have lost economic vitality since World War II and especially since the 1990s. Smaller communities and rural areas, they'd already seen so many of their young people migrate to the cities and metro areas, and much of what they still had has been lost since the year 2000. And it's easy to blame it all on foreign competition, whether that's the only culprit or not.But the tariffs are just part of Trump's larger effort to redefine the American people - the American role, I should say - in the global order, economically and in every other sense. Trump sees international agreements as weakening to the U.S., and he sees treaties by which the U.S. defends other countries as a bad bargain - a chance for other countries to freeload, whether they can afford to pull their own weight or not. Much of that seems far less about economics and more about political and even personal grievances, Scott.SIMON: What's the reaction in Congress?ELVING: The reaction that matters most is coming from the president's own party, the Republicans. Some of them have been worried for months about Trump's tariff talk, but they defend it as a way to soften up our trading partners. Prior to negotiations, that'll be good for us. They talk about what a savvy negotiator Trump is. But this week we saw several Republican senators backing two efforts to rein in not the threats, but the actual tariffs themselves. One would protect Canada, in particular, and the other would more generally and explicitly assert a role for Congress in setting tariff policy. Now, neither of these has any chance in the House where Trump's hold is still absolute. But the first signs of restiveness in the Senate alone are notable, given the lockstep we've seen in support of Trump's nominees and budget moves in the past, including the most controversial ones.SIMON: Nationwide protests against the Trump administration happening this weekend. Earlier this week, a one-man protest marathon. Senator Cory Booker held the Senate floor and spoke for more than 25 straight hours.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CORY BOOKER: I listen to him.

Some of them have been worried for months about Trump's tariff talk, but they defend it as a way to soften up our trading partners. Prior to negotiations, that'll be good for us. They talk about what a savvy negotiator Trump is. But this week we saw several Republican senators backing two efforts to rein in not the threats, but the actual tariffs themselves. One would protect Canada, in particular, and the other would more generally and explicitly assert a role for Congress in setting tariff policy. Now, neither of these has any chance in the House where Trump's hold is still absolute. But the first signs of restiveness in the Senate alone are notable, given the lockstep we've seen in support of Trump's nominees and budget moves in the past, including the most controversial ones.SIMON: Nationwide protests against the Trump administration happening this weekend. Earlier this week, a one-man protest marathon. Senator Cory Booker held the Senate floor and spoke for more than 25 straight hours.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)CORY BOOKER: I listen to him. I listen to how he talks about people. We have a government now, as I said earlier, that isn't ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country. We have a country now where a president says, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for Donald Trump.SIMON: Senator Booker set a record for floor speeches. No food, water, bathroom breaks. Lot of leg cramps. Did he make a political point, too?ELVING: He did make a political point, partly by breaking a record that had been set by a segregationist senator fighting the civil rights bill back in the 1950s. But the larger meaning for our moment in time is as a kind of alarm bell in the night. Booker was saying this is not just another left-right dispute, another spot - spat between the parties. There are issues here as fundamental as the Constitution itself, the shared powers of the branches and the primacy of Congress. Trump has shown he's willing to bypass Congress, even to question the authority of the courts. So the president and his party have all the levers right now, and he has shown a willingness to push those levers hard.SIMON: Ron Elving, thanks so much.ELVING: Thank you, Scott.

ELVING: That is the heart of the sales pitch, and it has a lot of appeal in the parts of the country that have lost economic vitality since World War II and especially since the 1990s. Smaller communities and rural areas, they'd already seen so many of their young people migrate to the cities and metro areas, and much of what they still had has been lost since the year 2000. And it's easy to blame it all on foreign competition, whether that's the only culprit or not.But the tariffs are just part of Trump's larger effort to redefine the American people - the American role, I should say - in the global order, economically and in every other sense.

70,2025-04-05,"There isn't a perfect flip phone cover screen, but one comes closer than the other.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.


Android Central's Editor's Desk is a weekly column discussing the latest news, trends, and happenings in the Android and mobile tech space.
For me, the cover screen experience is one of the most important aspects of the modern flip phone. At first glance, it can seem gimmicky, but the external display is actually pretty useful and helps keep the phone pocketable. In fact, I find myself utilizing the cover screen more than not when I use a flip phone. That said, no cover screen experience is perfect, although one company does come close.
Motorola has pretty much set the standard on what a cover screen should be with its Razr smartphones, while Samsung has gone a different route with the external display on the Galaxy Z Flip line. Still, both offer fairly similar experiences on both devices, and both have their strengths and weaknesses.
With that in mind, I decided to put them to the test to see which was the easiest to use without opening the phone. I would spend a whole day using only the cover screen on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 and Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6.

Off the bat, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 was a bit frustrating. Even before I got started, I had to go through quite a bit of set up to make sure I could get what I needed out of the cover screen, and Samsung doesn't make it easy.
Getting set up to use apps on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen is a bit of a chore in itself. While the One UI 7 update makes things a little more accessible, Samsung still limits cover screen interactions (especially notifications) to the apps you have set to use on the cover screen.
Furthermore, you can add more apps from the cover screen; you have to open the phone to edit cover screen widgets and add more apps that you may need. This is why the setup took some time, as I had to ensure I had all the apps I knew I would use within a 24-hour time span.

After everything was said and done, using the cover screen throughout the day was a bit of a mixed bag on the Galaxy Z Flip 6. Using the panels was a fine way to check the weather, control music, and perform other quick, glanceable tasks. The apps I set to work on the external display also worked mostly as expected on the smaller screen, although it did pose some challenges.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
The somewhat small display made apps appear vertically scrunched, and some UI elements would awkwardly overlap. This would limit my view and even hide functions on apps like YouTube Music and Google Calendar, although they weren't unusable. However, the limitations of the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen would hinder me in other ways.
The quick settings menu on the cover screen is a fixed set of eight toggles that you can't change. Many of these are options that are actually useful, but the fact that I can't add others is really annoying, especially since I can edit quick settings on a Galaxy Watch.
I also can't just tap and hold the Bluetooth toggle to add a new device. I would have to open the Settings app (which you also can't access from the quick settings menu) and do it from there, which is pretty inconvenient.
Multitasking is also just not really a thing on the cover screen. If I open one app, I can't open a Current Apps view to switch to another app. I would have to exit the app, swipe back to the Launcher panel, and then open the next app I was looking for. This becomes incredibly inconvenient when I need to copy something from one app and paste it into another.
Oh, and did I mention that even if you have Gboard as your default keyboard, you're stuck with Samsung Keyboard on the cover screen? Yeah, that's a no from me, dawg.
Ultimately, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 failed the experiment. The experience was just too cumbersome with the limitations when multitasking, interacting with notifications, or trying to perform certain tasks that would require me to open the phone.

Things were a bit different with the Razr Plus 2024, and while I was able to get through an entire day without opening the phone, the experience highlighted some of the shortcomings of the Razr cover screen.
Unlike the Galaxy Z Flip, I didn't have to go through any lengthy setup to get the cover screen ready. There were no apps to download to get my apps to work on the Razr cover screen. I just enabled the app widget, tapped the pencil icon on the cover screen, and chose what apps I wanted or didn't want. I could always add or remove apps whenever I wanted without opening the phone.
Just like with the Galaxy Z Flip, Motorola also has a host of panels for quick access to weather, contacts, games, and even widgets. The home screen also lets me set four app shortcuts for your most used apps, which is pretty handy and saves me from having to swipe over to the app screen.

As far as how apps work, it's pretty similar to the Galaxy Z Flip 6, although the larger cover screen means apps have more room to stretch. This keeps the app's own UI elements from blocking other parts of the app, although it also highlights another problem with Motorola's implementation: the cameras.
Because the dual camera system is set within the bottom right corner of the display, the sensors often block certain aspects of the UI. This is mostly a problem with text fields where buttons like Send are usually set to the bottom right side.
Fortunately, you can press and hold the bottom navigation bar to shift the bottom of the app UI up. It scrunches the app a bit, but you'll have full view of the parts covered by the camera, then you can press and hold it again to bring back the full screen view. It's not a huge issue, but it can feel cumbersome to do this constantly. Still, it shows Motorola thought hard about how to get the most out of the external display.
Social media apps like Instagram are also awkward to view on the Razr. Watching Reels or Stories will often just show a zoomed-in section of the video instead of a full view. The only time you can see the full view of Story is if you're watching your own, which is an odd behavior.

Aside from that, most apps behave and function as expected, which is refreshing. I can even multitask with a Current Apps view, which is extremely useful, and using the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen, which doesn't have one, made me realize how much I rely on it. That also goes for the quick settings menu, which is much more robust on the Razr Plus and lets me have as many as 15 toggles that I unfortunately can't edit.
The downside is that Motorola doesn't allow me to open the Settings app from the cover screen, which is a weird omission. The Bluetooth toggle is also somewhat limited, letting me connect to previous devices but not pair with new ones. Fortunately, I didn't find myself needing to set up new wireless earbuds.
Finally, the Razr Plus cover screen plays nicely with Google Services. Google Wallet on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is usable from the cover screen, but tapping a payment terminal won't pull up any sort of UI for visual confirmation, something the Razr will do.
I also cannot utilize 2FA on the Galaxy cover screen when signing into a Google account. It will just pull up a notification that I can't interact with, whereas the confirmation screen will appear on the Razr so I can tap Yes. I do this quite often, so it's an annoying limitation on the Z Flip.

There are few reasons why you'll want to use just the cover screen on these phones, unless you find the main display broken or unusable for some reason. However, the experience really highlights how they're different and where their strengths and weaknesses lie.
It's clear the Razr Plus 2024 has a better cover screen, but Motorola should continue to optimize it with future updates. A Settings app would be nice, for example, and it would be cool to view vertical videos on social media apps in their entirety instead of just a partial view.
Samsung needs to revamp its cover screen experience, starting with eliminating the MultiStar requirement to use third-party apps. That would be a major step to improving the phone and would definitely help me consider making the Galaxy Z Flip my primary phone over the Razr.
Still, both the Razr Plus 2024 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 are great phones, and even well into 2025, they remain two of the best flip phones on the market. That is until the Razr Plus 2025 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 arrive, both of which could bring welcome improvements to the cover screen.

…..has invested all her money in money.  It makes the mattress a little lumpy but the practice is comforting.
I’m so happy that I started panicking at the beginning of March when Trump announced he was now going to focus on the economy.
…
As Trump’s mother said: “Yes, he’s an idiot. And I hope he never goes into politics. It would be a total disaster.”
Mother knows best.

81,2025-04-05,"Donald Trump, in announcing his sweeping new tariffs on US imports on Wednesday, promised that the history books would record 2 April as America's ""liberation day"". 
After two days of stock market turmoil, however, this may also be remembered as the week the president's second-term agenda ran headfirst into economic - and political - reality.
US stocks have been in a tailspin since Trump unveiled his tariffs at Wednesday afternoon's White House Rose Garden event, with signs that America's trading partners - Canada, the European Union and China, most notably - are not backing away from a fight.

Follow live updates

Meanwhile, other presidential efforts, on foreign policy and immigration, and at the ballot box - have faced notable setbacks in recent days.
The White House on Thursday felt a bit like a building battening down for a coming storm. The four big posters showing America's ""reciprocal"" tariffs on a long list of countries were on prominent display in the press briefing room, but administration officials available to respond to media questions were few and far between.
Out on Pennsylvania Avenue, workers unloaded pallets of metal fencing, which will ring the White House grounds in preparation for what officials anticipate to be a large anti-Trump demonstration at the nearby Washington Monument on Saturday. The first lady announced that a White House garden tour event that had been scheduled for that day had been postponed because of security concerns.
Even the normally loquacious president stopped only briefly to talk with the crush of reporters on his way to board the Marine One helicopter on the first leg of his journey to Florida.
""I said this would be exactly the way it is,"" he declared when asked about the day's stock market turmoil. The markets - and America as a whole - would soon boom, he said.
The president, it seems, is willing to wait out the tempest created by his tariff plan. He appears confident that his economic vision of a rebuilt, job-rich American manufacturing sector protected from foreign competition - a vision he has closely held for decades - will ultimately be proven right.
The Trump agenda's close encounter with cold, hard reality wasn't limited to trade this week, however.
His two top foreign policy priorities - ending the wars in Gaza and Ukraine - both appear mired in the kind of messy details and conflicting agendas that often obstruct lasting peace.
Israel has once again moved into Gaza and escalated a bombing campaign that is generating reports of widespread civilian casualties. The ceasefire that Trump touted in the days before he took office appears to be in tatters.
Russia, meanwhile, continues to pile new conditions on to negotiations for a full ceasefire with Ukraine, which is an indication that the nation may be buying time to allow its ground forces to take more territory.
""If I think they're tapping us along, I will not be happy about it,"" Trump said of Russia. But he added that he still believes President Vladimir Putin wants to ""make a deal"".
Evidence so far indicates the contrary, according to Jake Sullivan, who was President Joe Biden's national security adviser. 
In an interview with the BBC, he accused Trump of handing Russia most of its demands, though he acknowledged it was still early in the process and things could yet change.
""So the current dynamic in these negotiations a) is not in fact producing Russian willingness to reach a fair and just compromise, but b) is actually stimulating a view in Moscow that if they just keep holding out, they're just going to keep getting concessions from the United States. And so far that is what has happened.""
Even Trump's deportation and immigration enforcement efforts, which still have high public support, have been at least partially derailed by legal challenges.
While his administration has successfully completed several flights transferring alleged Tren de Aragua Venezuelan gang members to an El Salvadoran high-security prison, the judge presiding over a case challenging those deportations said on Thursday there was a ""fair likelihood"" officials had violated his court order to turn the flights around.
Other court challenges - to Trump's suspension of political asylum processing and refugee resettlement, his attempt to end birthright citizenship and his revocation of temporary protected status for about 350,000 Venezuelans - are currently working their way through the US legal system. 
At some point, the US Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on many of these disputes.
This week also marked the biggest round of elections since Trump's November 2024 victory, as voters headed to the polls in Wisconsin to elect a state judge and in two Florida special elections for seats in the House of Representatives.
While the Republican candidates in Florida prevailed, their winning margins were about 15%, which is about half of what Trump posted in those congressional districts in November.
In Wisconsin, a key political battleground state, the Democratic-backed candidate won. Democrats were able to maintain the liberal majority on the court despite the tens of millions of dollars spent by conservative groups, including by tech billionaire Elon Musk, who campaigned there in person.
Taken as a whole the results suggest that Democrats are doing well in hotly contested races and may be making inroads even in reliably conservative areas - in part by campaigning against Musk and his efforts to massively cut federal programmes and staff. 
That could be an indication that the party will have the political wind at their backs in state elections this November and the midterm congressional elections next year.
The stock market tumult, and those ballot-box results, may be behind a few scattered signs of dissent within Republican ranks.
Ted Cruz, an arch-conservative senator from Texas, said on his podcast on Friday that Trump's tariffs ""could hurt jobs and could hurt America"" - particularly if other nations retaliate, as China has already done.
""If we're in a scenario 30 days from now, 60 days from now, 90 days from now, with massive American tariffs, and massive tariffs on American goods in every other country on Earth, that is a terrible outcome,"" he continued.
On Wednesday night in the US Senate, four Republicans joined with Democrats to support rescinding the emergency declaration that justifies Trump's earlier Canada tariffs. 
And on Thursday, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa joined with Democrat Maria Cantwell of Washington to back a measure that would require Congress to directly approve tariffs that stay in effect longer than 60 days.
Republicans by and large have been sticking with the president. They seem unwilling, or unable, to sway Trump from his current course on tariffs and government cuts and appear fearful of the political consequences of breaking with the man who has a vice-like grip on the party.
But if the current economic shock becomes a long-term hardship, and if government programme cuts translate into tangible disruptions in popular services or if Trump's standing in opinion polls continues to sag, members of his own party may begin eyeing the exit signs for the first time in years. 
And that would bring an unceremonious end to some of Trump's most ambitious efforts.
Trump, no longer worried about standing before voters, may feel liberated from the immediate political consequences of his actions - but reality has a way of asserting itself in the end.
Sarah Boardman says she is facing a backlash over her work and is concerned for her business.
What made the US step back from the system that it profited handsomely from for decades?
Thousands of protesters gathered for the most visible opposition movement of Trump's second term. 
US President Donald Trump has imposed a 10% tariff on UK goods, but a 20% tariff on EU goods.
What's happening in Whitehall to try to limit the harm to the UK, perhaps by making a deal with the US, and make the most of any opportunities?

83,2025-04-05,"The Danes seem to believe him, and so should Americans.
The United States grabbing land from an ally sounds like the stuff of a Netflix political thriller. But every American should contemplate three realities about Donald Trump’s aggressive desire to acquire Greenland, a semiautonomous Danish territory. First, unlike his usual shtick, in which he floats wild ideas and then he and his aides alternate between saying he was serious and saying he might have been joking, he means it. The Danes seem to believe him, and so should Americans. When institutions begin planning based on the president’s directions, as the White House is now doing, it’s no longer idle talk.
Second, Trump is calling for actions that likely contravene American and international law. He is undermining the peace and stability of an allied nation, while threatening a campaign of territorial conquest. He refuses to rule out an unprovoked war of aggression, a violation of the United Nations Charter and an international crime that would be little different in kind from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s attempt to seize Ukraine. Finally, the almost-certain illegality of any attempt to seize Greenland against the will of its people and the Danish government means that if Trump directs the U.S. military to engage in such an operation, he could well precipitate the greatest civil-military crisis in American history since the Civil War.
How do we know Trump is serious? “One way or another,” the president crowed in his speech to a Joint Session of Congress last month, “we’re gonna get it.” A few weeks later, in case anyone missed the point, Trump told NBC: “We’ll get Greenland. Yeah, 100 percent.” Trump says a lot of strange things, certainly. He has mused about striking hurricanes with nuclear weapons, running for a constitutionally prohibited third term, staying in office even if he loses, and annexing Canada as the 51st state. But when a president publicly makes a vow to Congress to do something and then repeats that vow over and over, such statements are not trial balloons; they are policy.
And sure enough, Trump has followed up by sending Vice President J. D. Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, as unwelcome emissaries to Greenland. Vance—a neo-isolationist who apparently expresses opposition to the president’s plans only in Signal chats—has now embraced Trump’s old-school imperialism. Worse, Vance tried to press Trump’s case by boorishly criticizing Denmark’s relationship with the island, smarmily telling the Danes: “You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland.” (Imagine the reaction in Washington if a European leader came, say, to Puerto Rico, castigated America’s management of the commonwealth, and urged the island to sever ties with the United States.) But at least he promised that military force, which to gain Greenland would have to be directed against Denmark, a NATO ally, was not going to be part of America’s efforts.
Trump, true to form, short-sheeted his hapless VP the next day by saying that military force was not, in fact, “off the table.”
On Monday, The Washington Post reported that the White House has begun work on estimating the costs of controlling Greenland in “the most concrete effort yet to turn President Donald Trump’s desire to acquire the Danish territory into actionable policy.” Once these kinds of meetings start taking place in the White House, the next step is usually to send out orders to the rest of the American national-security establishment, including the CIA and the Pentagon, to begin planning for various contingencies.
Even if the American people supported direct aggression against our own allies—by a large margin, they do not—public opinion is not a legitimate excuse for treaty-breaking. Treaties are the law of the land in the United States, and the president’s Article II powers as commander in chief do not allow him to wave a monarchical hand and violate those treaties at will. Just as Trump cannot legally issue orders to violate the Geneva Conventions or other agreements to which the United States is a signatory, he does not have the right to break America’s pact with NATO at will and effectively declare war against Denmark. When George W. Bush ordered U.S. forces into combat against Iraq in 2003, some of his critics claimed that his actions were illegal, but Bush at least had the fig leaf of a congressional resolution, as well as a lengthy list of UN Security Council resolutions. Trump will have literally nothing except his insistent greed and glory-seeking vanity.
If the U.S. military is given direct orders to seize Greenland—that is, if it is told to enter the territory of another nation, pull down that nation’s flag, and then claim the ground in the name of the United States—it will have been ordered to attack an ally and engage in a war of conquest, even if no shot is ever fired. These would be illegal orders, because they would violate not only our treaty obligations but also international prohibitions against unprovoked wars of aggression. At home, the president would be contravening the Constitution: Article II does not allow the commander in chief to run around the planet seizing territories he happens to want.
At that point, every senior commander, from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs on down, has a moral obligation to refuse to accept or support such a command. Pauline Shanks Kaurin, a military-ethics professor at the Naval War College (where I also taught for many years) told me, speaking in her personal capacity and not on behalf of the Defense Department, that civilian leaders have “the right to be wrong,” but that if the United States moves against Greenland, especially if both America and Denmark are part of NATO, “senior military leaders have an obligation to advise against this course of action and resign if necessary.” Shanks Kaurin added that this obligation might even extend to a requirement to refuse to draw up any plans.
But what if the orders are less obvious? Trump long ago mastered the Mafia-like talent of making his desires evident without actually telling others to engage in unsavory acts. In that case, he could issue instructions to the military aimed at intimidating Greenland that on their face are legal but that are obviously aggressive.
Retired Major General Charles Dunlap, who served as the deputy judge advocate general of the U.S. Air Force and now teaches law at Duke, suggested that Trump could take advantage, for example, of the wide latitude given to the United States in its basing agreement with Greenland. The president, Dunlap told me in an email, could choose to engage in “a gross misreading of the agreement” and move a large number of troops to Greenland as “a show of force aimed at establishing a fait accompli of some kind.” Military officers are required to presume that commands from higher authority are legal orders, and so a series of directives aimed at swarming forces into Greenland would likely be obeyed, Dunlap said, “because of the potential ambiguity” of such directives “as well as the inference of lawfulness.”
In any case, Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have taken important steps to ensure that no one is left in the Pentagon to tell them that their orders might be unlawful. All of the top military lawyers whose job is to provide independent legal advice on such matters have been fired. And, as Dunlap notes, courts are notoriously reluctant to get involved in such questions, which is why Congress must step in. “The military,” he said, “ought not be put in the middle of something like this.”
Americans used to take their presidents far more seriously. Before Trump, when a president spoke, his words instantly became the policy of the United States government—for better or worse. When President Ronald Reagan caught his own aides flat-footed by bungling a policy message during a press conference in 1983, for example, a Reagan-administration official later said: “You can’t say ‘No, he didn’t mean it’ or ‘That’s not really government policy.’ That’s out of the question.”
But those days are long gone. As a direct result of Trump’s many off-the-cuff ruminations and long stretches of political glossolalia, Trump has convinced many Americans not to take their president at his word until it’s too late. (Consider how many people, for example, refused to believe that he would impose massive global tariffs, a policy they can now examine more closely by the light of a burning stock market.)
I realize that this entire discussion seems like utter lunacy. War against … Denmark? But when the president says something, it’s policy. Trump insists that he must be taken seriously. Americans and their elected representatives across the political spectrum should oblige him."

The Black Arrow, also known as the Small Cruise Missile, has completed a guided flight test from an AC-130J Ghostrider gunship, the weapon’s manufacturer, Leidos, has confirmed. The Black Arrow, which is intended to carry a range of different payloads, and not just a kinetic warhead, arrives at a time when the Pentagon is looking at harnessing the potential of lower-cost weapons that can be readily produced at scale to meet the likely demands of future conflicts.
Leidos only recently announced the flight test although it occurred last November. The company also published a video of the test, showing Black Arrow being launched from a pair of Ramp Launch Tubes (RLT) mounted on the rear ramp of the AC-130J. The Black Arrow is released tail-first from the RLT, after which its single-piece pop-out wing deploys. The motor can then be seen starting. The weapon’s subsequent impact into the ground is not shown in the video.
As well as using the RLT, Leidos says that Black Arrow can be launched from a palletized system or conventionally released from a stores pylon on a fixed-wing aircraft.
“The test demonstrated aircraft compatibility, system performance, waypoint uplinks, guidance accuracy as well as integration with the Naval Surface Warfare Center Battle Management System (BMS),” the company said in a media release.
The test was conducted as part of a Collaborative Research and Development (CRADA) agreement between Leidos, the U.S. Special Operations Command (SOCOM), and the Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC).
Weighing around 200 pounds, the Black Arrow is intended to be a low-cost “mission-adaptable delivery platform,” rather than a traditional munition. This means it can be configured for both kinetic and non-kinetic missions. At the same time, it’s designed to facilitate spiral upgrades.
The CRADA program for the SCM, now known as Black Arrow, began in 2022, since when the interest in so-called affordable mass has only grown. Leidos says it has used model-based system engineering practices as well as open system architecture to ensure that Black Arrow is affordable and can be built rapidly at scale, if required.
“SCM is a key capability, rapidly advancing AFSOC’s ability to close long-range kill chains,” Col. Justin Bronder, SOCOM PEO Fixed Wing, said at the Special Air Warfare Symposium held at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, last month.
Previously, we had gotten our first glimpse of what was then only known as the Small Cruise Missile when SOCOM included a picture of it in a briefing at the annual SOF Week conference in May of last year.
At the time, SOCOM said the SCM was one of its top priorities and could be launched from the MC-130J Commando II special operations tanker/transport aircraft, as well as the AC-130J, and potentially other platforms.
Adding standoff strike capabilities to aircraft like these is seen as a critical way to ensure their continued relevance, especially in future high-end conflicts, including a potential one in the Pacific against China. For the AC-130J, in particular, being able to address targets relatively quickly far from the current station it is on would allow it to support strikes across a much larger geographical area.  
Right now the aircraft can drop Small Diameter Bombs, at a range of dozens of miles. That would be enhanced massively with a small cruise missile. A missile with a 200 mile range would allow the AC-130 to strike targets anywhere within a 125,664 square mile circle around it. An SDB, with say a range of say 30 miles when dropped from the AC-130’s launch altitude and speed, allows the aircraft to strike anywhere within a 2,827 square mile circle. So we are talking about a massive difference here in capability 
Then there is using the aircraft as a standoff weapons delivery platform in a high-end fight where it’s direct fire capabilities will be of less value due to the range of modern enemy air defenses. You can learn all about the future of AC-130 in our video below: 
Before that, in 2021, SOCOM issued a contracting notice regarding a Stand-Off Precision Guided Weapon Program Cruise Missile outlining interest in a weapon of this type. The specifications included a range of between 200 and 400 nautical miles (around 230 and 460 miles) while the weapon was required to fit inside a standardized cylindrical Common Launch Tube (CLT).
The size and weight of the SCM/Black Arrow rules out its carriage in a CLT, which can accommodate payloads up to 42 inches in length and 5.95 inches in diameter, and has a 100-pound weight limit, according to SOCOM.
The Stand-Off Precision Guided Weapon Program Cruise Missile notice also outlined a requirement for an electro-optical/infrared seeker, with plans to incorporate a multi-mode seeker package “able to acquire and/or reacquire targets in flight.” Other key attributes specified in the notice were a long-range, datalink connection to Situational Awareness Data Link (SADL) (threshold) and SADL/Link-16 (objective), resilient GPS/INS to work in a denied GPS environment, “a sensor capable of identifying targets once over the target area, and a payload to effect the target,” the notice added.
Leidos says it’s under contract with SOCOM to continue Black Arrow test and evaluation activities throughout 2025.
At this stage, however, it’s unclear what additional platforms it might be tested on, or what kinds of payloads might be involved.
The size and weight of Black Arrow would render it suitable for carriage by a wide range of platforms, including drones.
Black Arrow also arrives at a time when the U.S. military, more generally, is looking at low-cost air vehicles that could be turned into cruise missiles, as well as electronic attackers.
Central to these concerns is the ability to expand the available industrial base to help stock up on more affordable weapons ahead of a future high-end conflict, such as one against China, and sustaining those inventories in a protracted fight.
The Air Force is now running the Enterprise Test Vehicle (ETV) program, with a view to addressing some of these supply chain issues, and particularly as a stepping stone to a new lower-cost cruise missile.
Leidos subsidiary Dynetics — alongside Anduril Industries, Integrated Solutions for Systems, Inc., and Zone 5 Technologies — was selected in July of last year to design, build, and flight test an ETV concept.
Interestingly, the Dynetics offering for the Air Force’s ETV program looks to be very similar to the SCM/Black Arrow.
With testing of the SCM/Black Arrow continuing under SOCOM contract, and with the same design apparently also being offered for the Air Force’s ETV initiative, it will certainly be interesting to see what’s next in store for the Leidos product.

New York City’s convoluted property tax system, now exactly 50 years old, overtaxes large multifamily buildings, making it harder to build enough apartments to solve the city’s housing crisis.
The lowest property taxes are levied on homeowners, especially those who live in areas with fast-rising property values, even though two-thirds of city households rent.
Areas dominated by Black homeowners pay property tax rates that are double those of primarily white neighborhoods.
And the more expensive a cooperative or condominium unit, the more likely it will be to pay relatively low property taxes because of the city’s flawed system for assessing value.
Those are the major conclusions of a new report on the system called “Footing the Bill,” released Monday by the Community Service Society and the Progress and Poverty Institute, aligning those two progressive groups with fiscal organizations like the Citizens Budget Commission and real estate groups like the Real Estate Board of New York in calling for an overhaul of property taxes in the city.
The organizations will be hosting a “birthday party” panel discussion Monday in conjunction with the report’s release, all part of an effort to prompt mayoral candidates to address a looming issue campaigns have conspicuously avoided.
“I find it a little distressing that candidates are not mentioning the property tax,” said Martha Stark, the former city finance director who is a key force behind Tax Equity Now New York, the group trying to force changes through a lawsuit pending in state Supreme Court. “Maybe that is failure on our part.”
This year marks the 50th anniversary of a state Court of Appeals decision that found the city’s property system illegal. Since then, its replacement has “aged poorly,” according to the report — which echoes the findings of many other studies and media investigations in the past.
The unfairness of the system is clear, the Community Service Society and Progress and Poverty Institute’s study finds in its analysis of public data, including assessments and tax abatements. 
Residential properties with one to three units pay an effective tax rate of only 0.7% of their value while apartment buildings with more than 10 units face an average effective tax rate of 3.6%, about five times as much.
“This disincentives development of multi-family housing,” said Iziah Thompon, one of the authors at CSS. “The cost of property taxes are passed along to renters.”
The city caps the amount of any increase in value that can be added to a residential property’s assessment in any given year. Property owners in neighborhoods that have seen sharp increases in values like Park Slope or the East Village pay far lower taxes as a percent of market value compared with areas that have seen values rise more slowly like Canarsie, East New York and Cambria Heights. Park Slope and the East Village are primarily white, while Black homeowners dominate the other three.
The city also assesses co-ops and condos as if they were rent-regulated apartments, which leads to assessed values and property taxes much lower for luxury units, especially in Manhattan, than their market values would justify.

The system “benefits the haves over the have not,” the report concludes.
Meanwhile, the system could be upended by a case before a Supreme Court judge in Manhattan.
In 2017, frustrated by a lack of action, advocates and real estate groups behind Tax Equity Now filed a lawsuit challenging the system, charging it disproportionately affected racial minorities and perpetuated segregation. A lower court dismissed the lawsuit, saying the legislature could make changes if it wanted. 
On the last day of the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio in 2021, a commission he created in part because of the lawsuit recommended sweeping changes to deal with the inequities, but so far nothing has come of them.
But early last year the Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court, reinstated the lawsuit by a vote of 4 to 3 and sent it back to the Supreme Court. The ruling also indicated that the majority agreed with some of the arguments of Tax Equity Now and suggested steps the city could take to make the system fairer even while acknowledging many reforms would require approval of the Legislature and the governor.
Under the ruling, the city could adopt uniform assessment practices on all residential properties and end the use of rent-regulated comparison for co-ops and condos, said Stark.

“It’s been a year, and the city has done nothing,” she added.
Tired of waiting, Tax Equity Now in January asked the Supreme Court judge hearing the case to issue a summary judgement forcing the city to make the changes the Court of Appeals suggested.
Last week, the administration of Mayor Eric Adams finally filed a response opposing summary judgement, claiming action would harm taxpayers and hurt the city’s fiscal health.
But the mayor remains committed to reforms, said spokesperson Liz Garcia, and expects to see reform legislation introduced later in the current legislative session. She did not give details on what changes Adams might propose.
Meanwhile, candidates for mayor have virtually nothing to say about the issue as they campaign. Only four candidates responded to a request by THE CITY to detail their position.
Former city comptroller Scott Stringer’s campaign said it expects to issue a statement on property taxes soon but had no comment now.
A spokesperson for Sen. Zellnor Myrie responded that he has long supported changing the system and noted he had told a group of journalists that “my administration is going to be open to conversations about how we fix some of the inequities in our property tax system.”
A spokesperson for former governor Andrew Cuomo, who is far ahead in the polls, referred THE CITY to a white paper on affordability that called for extending a 2% cap on increases in property tax collections that exists elsewhere in the state to homeowners in the city.
“I am not sure what that means, but more caps would make the problem worse,” said Thompson of the Community Service Society.
A request to the Cuomo campaign to respond went unanswered.
City Comptroller Brad Lander, who has been one of the most vocal politicians on this issue, has endorsed reforms including putting most residential properties into a single class and cutting rates on rental housing by 30% to match the levies on condos and co-ops and encourage more building.

BYD is finally entering the popular midsize SUV market.
If there’s one Chinese brand that you’re destined to hear an increasing amount from in the coming years, it’s BYD. The company sold a record 4.27 million new energy vehicles in 2024, 1.76 million of which were battery electric, only slightly behind Tesla’s 1.79 million. BYD has been selling cars in Europe since 2022, and in the UK from 2023. The latest vehicle to hit Britain is the BYD Sealion 7. It’s another midsized SUV, BYD’s first in Europe. I took it for a spin to find out if it has enough to stand out in an overcrowded category.
BYD’s initial all-electric cars in the European market were the ATTO3 (a smaller SUV), Seal (sedan) and the Dolphin (a compact hatchback). Considering the value of the midsized SUV market globally, it’s a surprise that the Sealion 7 wasn’t the first model to hit the market from BYD. However, it arrives in an already crowded space, even if we just include the Chinese options. There’s the XPENG G6 in this class, the Leapmotor C10, and Deepal S07. Even Omoda’s E5 and the MGS5 EV could be competitors at the low end of the price bracket. Higher up the scale is Zeekr’s forthcoming 7X.
The Sealion 7 has a coupe look but is really more a standard SUV.
Of course, the most obvious comparison outside Chinese imports is the Tesla Model Y, which was just refreshed. The Sealion 7 is more in the Model Y’s range because of its price, performance and battery capacity. Whatever your feelings about the Tesla brand right now, its Model Y has always been a tough act to beat, with class-leading interior space, range and performance. This is the most likely car you will be considering at the same time as the Sealion 7.
The BYD Sealion 7 compares reasonably well with the Tesla Model Y in terms of powertrain. The basic Comfort model comes with an 82.5kWh battery and 312PS motor driving the rear wheels. The Design AWD partners the same battery with an all-wheel drive system delivering 530PS. The Excellence AWD uses the same motor but with a 91.3kWh battery. There aren’t any trim subdivisions of these three versions, other than a few optional extras. Equipment is generous across the board, with a panoramic sunroof, heated front and rear seats, a 360-degree parking camera and adaptive crise control as standard. Aside from the powertrain variations, there’s not much to differentiate between the three versions, apart from 20in wheels for the all-wheel drive cars and a head-up display plus leather seats for the Excellence. Whichever version you go for, the specification is high.
The Sealion 7 looks nice enough, with a grille-less tapered nose that indicates this is a pure BEV platform. The angular lights provide a serious, purposeful appearance. The rear slopes slightly, in a nod to the coupe SUV fashion, but this is still more of a regular SUV. The wheel arches are somewhat squared off with rugged plastic surrounds to resist damage. Overall, this is a reasonably attractive car but not overtly eye-catching.
The front seats are attractive and comfortable.
The interior is more of an indication that the Sealion 7 is a quality vehicle, with particularly comfortable and attractively upholstered front seats. These look sporty and have high side bolsters, which keep you firmly in place during vigorous driving. There’s a high central console with built-in wireless smartphone charging, generously sized cupholders and storage under the integrated armrest.
The rear seat experience is comfortable and spacious too.
Rear space is excellent, with plenty of legroom and headroom, accentuated by the panoramic sunroof. The outer seats are as attractively stitched as the front ones and equally comfortable; the middle seat will be more cramped for an adult over an extended period of time but you can pull the seatback down to create an armrest with cupholders if there are only two in the back.
Overall, the BYD Sealion 7 interior has a premium feel, which is indicative of the great leaps forward Chinese cars have made in the last the few years. The Deepal S07 punches above its weight in terms of interior quality for the money, and the XPENG G6 while a bit more functional is still well designed. In general, interiors are where Chinese cars are showing the most improvement, if you look back to what it was like inside the original MG ZS EV or MG5 EV (both great value cars). BMW still wears the crown for interior quality, but Chinese brands are catching up fast.
The Sealion 7 has a quality interior.
The BYD Sealion 7’s tech and cabin experience are also impressive. The steering wheel has plenty of solid-feeling function buttons and traditional stalks, but climate control is almost exclusively operated via the Sealion 7’s 15.6in infotainment screen. This has a trick up its sleeve like the ATTO3. It can rotate from portrait to landscape. This is more of a preference thing than having any different functionality in either orientation. Overall, the menu speed and layout make operations easy to find and smooth to operate.
Safety tech is comprehensive, including front and rear parking sensors, a 360-degree camera system, blind spot detection and adaptive cruise control. There’s lane centering (although not quite autonomous highway driving in the UK), automatic emergency braking, and cross traffic systems that alert you when travelling forwards and apply brakes when reversing. It’s a comprehensive list of driver assistances.
Plenty of cargo space for trips to the DIY store.
While rear passenger space is great, this hasn’t been achieved at the expense of rear cargo space. The basic luggage capacity is 520 liters, which rises to 1,789 liters with the rear seats down. The Tesla Model Y offers more but the Sealion 7 still has plenty of space for shopping, family trips, or picking up materials from the DIY store. There’s a 58-liter frunk as well, which is usefully large. The Sealion 7 can tow 750kg braked, with the AWD cars also able to manage 1,500kg braked. However, this requires a third-party OEM-certified towbar.
The version of the Sealion 7 I drove was the dual motor Excellence. It’s more fun than many in this class, with plenty of power available. Both AWD cars take 4.5 seconds to hit 62mph, making them slightly faster than the Tesla Model Y Long Range (although the current Launch Edition has the Acceleration Boost to make it quicker). The Comfort is still quite fast, taking 6.7 seconds to hit 62mph.
The central infotainment screen can rotate into portrait orientation.
Until I get my hands on the new Model Y, I can’t compare the driving experience to that, but the performance of the Sealion 7 AWD is on par with the old Model Y dual-motor Long Range, and the ride quality better, although this is purportedly an area where Tesla has improved. The Sealion 7 isn’t quite a sporty drive, but it is comfortably quick for an overtake and you can throw this heavy SUV around a bit if you want (it weighs between 2.2 and 2.4 tons, depending on the version).
Range is decent if not class leading across all Sealion 7 models. The Comfort version has a 300-mile WLTP rating, which drops to 283 miles for the Design AWD. Thanks to its larger pack, the Excellence AWD goes furthest of all, at 312 miles. However, we’ve had smaller BEV SUVs capable of this kind of range with smaller batteries for years, and the Tesla Model Y Long Range RWD goes a lot further with a smaller battery.
The Sealion 7's charging performance is competitive, although its range is average.
DC charging is quick, with 150kW maximum for the 82.5kWh pack and 230kW for the 91.3kWh unit. This means rapid charging from 10-80% takes 32 minutes for the smaller battery and 24 minutes for the larger one, giving the Excellence AWD particularly strong long-distance potential, although the other two cars will be fine too.
BYD’s warranty is generous too. The basic guarantee is for 6 years or 93,750 miles, with the drive motor and controller for the same mileage but extended to 8 years. The battery also has an 8-year warranty but for 125,000 miles and 70% capacity. It’s worth noting that BYD uses Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries in all its cars, where other manufacturers use this chemistry only in cheaper models. LFP technology tends to be less energy dense than Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) but is also safer and can endure as much as three times as many charge-discharge cycles. So you can be confident the Sealion 7 will maintain its range over years of use.
The BYD Sealion 7 is a quality, high-performance package with competitive features in most areas. However, it’s not as cheap as you might expect from a Chinese challenger brand. It starts at £47,000 ($60,500) for the Comfort version, £52,000 ($67,000) for the Design AWD, and £59,000 ($76,000) for the Excellence AWD, which puts it very squarely up against the Tesla Model Y. You still get more range, performance and cargo capacity for your money (at the moment) with the Y but there could be trouble ahead for the Tesla brand and you might be considering other options, which puts the Sealion 7 well into the picture.
BYD is set to be an increasingly visible brand on UK roads in the coming years.
Predicting what will happen in the automotive market amidst the global ructions caused by the US Trump administration is increasingly difficult. However, in the UK market at least, BYD has plenty of potential, and it’s likely to continue to do well in Europe too. The BYD Sealion 7 takes the company into this lucrative, high-volume segment of the car market. Next up will be the Dolphin Surf, a small car targeting the low-cost end of business. We’re probably going to see a lot more BYD-branded vehicles on UK and European roads over the next few years."

I am going on ""recession watch"" for only the 4th time in the 20+ years that I've been writing this blog.  In December 2022 I went on ""recession watch"", but I noted ""My sense is growth will stay sluggish in 2023, but the economy will avoid recession.""  And the economy did avoid recession!

The other two times were in early 2007 (housing bust / financial crisis), and in March 2020 (pandemic). And I correctly called a recession.Mostly I've made fun of the persistent recession callers!Now I'm concerned about tariff policy impacting the economy.  Usually fiscal, executive and trade policy decisions wouldn't lead to an immediate recession, but these tariffs are a huge blunder.   There have been other unforced errors - like cutting basic research spending - but that is more of a long-term issue.As an aside: Imagine a tech company announcing they were going to cut spending by eliminating R&D.  Their stock would plummet.  That is what the U.S. has done with some of the DOGE cuts.  

Some analysts have started forecasting a recession later this year due to the tariffs.  For example, from Yahoo Finance: JPMorgan becomes the first Wall Street bank to forecast a US recession following Trump's tariffsJPMorgan believes the US economy will enter a recession in the back half of 2025 as the impact of President Trump tariffs takes hold in the economy.

The firm's chief US economist Michael Feroli sees a two-quarter recession occurring in the back half of 2025 as GDP contracts by 1% in the third quarter of the year and by 0.5% in the fourth quarter. For the full-year 2025, Feroli's team projects GDP will fall by 0.3%.

Feroli added that a ""recession in economic activity"" will push the unemployment rate up to 5.3%.I'm not sure how to estimate the economic damage caused by these tariffs.  And they might just go away (no one knows).  There are also boycotts of U.S. goods and less international tourism based on both the tariffs and the inflammatory rhetoric of the new administration.  On the other hand, the U.S. economy is very resilient and was on solid footing at the beginning of the year.So, although I'm on ""recession watch"", I'm not currently predicting a recession.These two Economist covers capture the rapid change over the last 6 months.  The first is from October 2024.

Just after the election, Fed Chair Powell said, ""The recent performance of our economy has been remarkably good, by far the best of any major economy in the world."" And in December, Powell said the US economy is the ""envy of other large economies around the world"".

The 2nd cover is the current edition.  ""Ruination Day"".  Ouch.

Mostly I'll be watching my favorite model for business cycle forecasting that uses new home sales (also housing starts and residential investment).
I'll also be watching the yield curve, vehicle sales, heavy truck sales and weekly unemployment claims - amoung other indicators.To conclude: I'm now on recession watch, but I'm not predicting a recession.

Most indicators are misleading investors right now, with some looking rosy and others seemingly saying it’s time to panic.
So today we’re going to parse through the noise and look at what’s really going on under the hood of the US economy.
Then I’m going to give you our latest “CEF Insider intel” on what to do with stocks—and funds (specifically closed-end funds) that hold them. We’re also going to dig into one bond fund yielding an outsized 13% that’s set to benefit as uncertainty grows.
Consider the CNN Fear & Greed index, a closely watched sentiment indicator. As I write this, it’s showing a five-alarm fire.
Fear & Greed Index
Meantime, let’s look at the VIX, the market’s so-called “fear gauge.” You’d think that with the S&P 500 just closing out its worst quarter since 2022, the VIX would be spiking. Instead, crickets.
VIX Quiet
The VIX, which measures stock volatility, is at 22.3 as I write this—somewhat high territory compared to the last decade, but still pretty low in light of the worry the market has experienced going into April 2 tariff announcements. But in really moody times, this indicator rises to over 25, which it did several times in—you guessed it—2022.
I’m guessing that if you’re reading this, you may also be thinking of 2022 right now, since that year also saw fears of inflation and a stagnant economy that caused markets to sell off.
So today we’re going to drill into that and look at two reasons why, no, 2025 is not 2022 all over again. We’ll do it by looking at both inflation and stagnation to see if, in fact, either (or both!) are reasons for investors to worry.
(Sneak preview: The answer is no—but we do need to be more selective and look at areas beyond stocks, like corporate bonds, including the bond fund we’ll talk about below.)
I dislike pointing this out, because I almost always get comments from readers who (rightly!) tell me that prices keep going up in supermarkets and elsewhere. But, well …
Inflation, on a year-over-year basis, remains below 3%, according to the consumer price index (CPI). That’s far from the alarming levels we saw in 2022. To be sure, prices are still going up: And as upsetting as that’s been for consumers, the important point for the stock market is the question of how much. 
We can consider the current rise of 3% year-over-year to be a safe zone. And if you look at the right side of the chart above, you can see that since inflation fell off a cliff in early 2023, it has been slowly (but inconsistently) creeping closer to 2%.
The verdict here is clear: Inflation is not trending back to the eye-watering levels we saw in 2022. Yes, we do need to keep an eye on this, but it isn’t reason to panic. But what about the economy as a whole?
Earnings Growth Paths
BlackRock Global Chief Investment Strategist Wei Li pointed to this chart recently when she said in a recent LinkedIn post that corporate earnings are rising “still above the historical trend of 6% to 7%.” In other words, companies are not only growing profits, but they are doing so at a stronger rate than they tend to, on average.
It’s also worth noting that the S&P 500 saw earnings rise 17.8% in the fourth quarter of 2024, the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2021, when companies were comparing themselves against the economic shutdowns of 2020. That gives them some additional resilience in the face of tariffs and other unpredictable changes.
Investors are totally ignoring that earnings number, as well as the fact that 77% of S&P 500 companies exceeded EPS estimates when they reported earnings in the last quarter. That earnings growth is accompanied by 4.2% revenue growth at the start of 2025 and 2.8% spending growth by consumers after we take inflation into account.
I know this is a lot to take in, but the takeaway is that the average American is spending more not just because prices are going up, but because they’re buying more goods and services.
Companies, in turn, are taking in more revenue and expanding profit margins. And they’re making their operations more efficient, in turn causing their earnings to rise, too.
All of this is good news for investors. So the recent market price decline is a buying opportunity.
My beat, of course, is CEFs—often-ignored funds that yield around 8% on average. So let me talk about what all this means for our CEF strategy. The short answer is that we need to be very selective in this environment—and target other corners of the CEF market beyond those funds that hold stocks.
In 2025, we’ve seen CEFs hold their own for the most part, with average discounts to net asset value (NAV) for all CEFs around 5%, with stock funds at 6.2%. That might sound generous, but discounts were more like 8.5% in 2022, so this tells us there are fewer CEFs that are generously discounted.
This is why we’ve been holding off on adding more equity CEFs to our portfolio this year, choosing to focus instead on corporate-bond CEFs. As I write this, we have just two tickers in our equity-CEF bucket.
And we continue to like bond funds—especially those whose managers have been able to buy higher-yielding bonds with long durations. Those bonds are especially well-positioned as interest rates fall (something I see happening as the economy slows, which I expect as we move into the second half of 2025).
Case in point: the Nuveen Core Plus Impact Fund (NPCT), a 13%-yielder trading at a 7% discount to NAV today. As I write this, it holds 132 bonds with an average leverage-adjusted effective duration (which measures how much a bond is likely to go up or down in value in relation to interest rates) of 8.7 years.
That means NPCT will be able to bring in its bonds’ income streams for nearly a decade. And those bonds’ value will only increase as rates decline. The fact that we can pick this one up at a 7% discount to the value of the bonds it holds is a nice bonus and suggests more price upside ahead.

97,2025-04-05,"Wall Street Capitulates to Trump’s Tariffs
It’s hard to say what finally broke Wall Street’s will. Maybe it was the retaliatory 34 percent tariff from Beijing, or the sight of Jerome Powell brushing off the carnage like a man who’d just changed a flat tire. Maybe it was the unmistakable conviction in Donald Trump’s voice when he said, “China played it wrong. They panicked.”
Or maybe it was the simple realization—years in the making, but somehow still a surprise—that this president is not going to hand back the steering wheel to the Chamber of Commerce.
Whatever the trigger, Friday felt like capitulation. Not just a selloff or a rout—though it was certainly that, with the Nasdaq down nearly six percent, the Dow off more than 2,200 points, and the S&P 500 hemorrhaging value like a biotech firm with a bad FDA call. No, this was something more specific: a psychological surrender to the idea that tariffs are not merely a negotiating tactic or a transitory flourish. They are, for better or worse, policy. And not just policy, but a pillar of a new economic order in which global capital doesn’t get to write the rules.
The market, like a poker player who stayed in the hand far too long, seemed to be operating under the assumption that Trump would eventually fold. Surely he would blink. Surely Powell would cut. Surely this was all theater. The curtain will come down, everyone will take their bows, and we can return to life as we knew it.
You can see this in a recent column by the Wall Street Journal‘s investing sage Jason Zweig:

While nothing is certain in the short term, a few things are highly likely in the longer term.
“Ultimately the costs of the tariffs will be recognized and they will be rescinded,” says Bryan Taylor, chief economist at Finaeon, a research firm in Irvine, Calif., that compiles and analyzes centuries of financial data.
“When you look at the past,” he adds, “you see that eventually markets do recover, because over time logic prevails.”

But it’s now clear the tariffs will not be rescinded.
Just hours after China fired back, Powell took the stage and announced calmly and firmly that the Federal Reserve would not be providing any immediate monetary relief. Inflation, he noted, remains above target. Rate cuts, he hinted, are off the table for now. The economy, he added, is not yet showing signs of weakness that would justify intervention. And the kicker: “We don’t need to be in a hurry.”
This came as news to the traders who were, at that very moment, sprinting for the exits.
Like President Trump, Chairman Powell is a man who knows he is in his last act in public life. There’s no third term for him at the helm of the central bank. He’s thinking about his legacy. And he posed on Friday as a man unmoved by the howling of bond traders, impervious to the usual warnings from economists about business confidence and financial conditions. He looked out at the wreckage of the stock market and, to the market’s horror, gave it a shrug.

And then, right on cue, came Larry Summers—horrified that the White House might pursue a policy the stock market doesn’t like. “We don’t have these kinds of stock market responses in response to policies that the President of the United States is proud of,” he said in an interview with CNN’s Kasie Hunt. “That is something entirely without precedent.”
Well, not quite. Presidents have defied markets before, though not often. What was truly remarkable about Summers’ comment was what it implied: that stocks ought to have veto power over policy. That a few red ticks on a Bloomberg terminal constitute a rebuke from history itself. That the Dow is not just a barometer of sentiment, but a tribunal of legitimacy. One might have expected this kind of theology from a hedge fund newsletter, not from a Democratic elder statesman who once championed industrial policy and warned about financialization. But here we are.
Summers wasn’t alone. Around the globe, officials lined up like mourners at a wake, lamenting the death of what they like to call the “rules-based” global order—by which they meant one that allows every other country in the world to look out for itself first, building enormous trade surpluses that fund their generous social welfare states while here in the U.S. corporations offshore American jobs to maximize shareholder value. The press and Wall Street dutifully repeated their liturgy. CNN warned of a $3 trillion loss in stock market value. JPMorgan raised its odds of a global recession to 60 percent. The talking heads on cable shook their heads and called the whole thing madness.
And yet, out in the real economy, something strange happened: the data didn’t cooperate.
The March jobs report came in hot—228,000 new jobs, a clean beat over the 140,000 expected. Wage growth held steady. Labor force participation ticked up. Not even a tremor of panic in the labor market. Wall Street had been bracing for weakness. What it got was strength.
Zweig, in his characteristically thoughtful column, noted that over the long arc of history, markets recover. They always do. Which may be true. But the more immediate truth is that markets had been counting on something quite specific: that Trump’s tariffs were temporary, tactical, and reversible.
That assumption may have died on Friday. What the market saw wasn’t just retaliation or volatility. It saw Trump holding his ground, and Powell refusing to cushion the blow.
For investors raised on QE, rate cuts, TARP, and central bank forward guidance, this was uncharted territory. They were, for the first time in years, being told: no. No bailouts, no stimulus, no reversal. The old contract—the one that said markets always get what they want—had been voided.
For many of them, it felt like a betrayal. A violation of the social contract they believed bound elected officials to the will of capital. Losses were supposed to be for other people—for steelworkers in West Virginia, shoemakers in New Hampshire, furniture men in Ohio, the folks making auto parts in Indiana and Michigan, or weaving textiles in South Carolina. The kind of people who, when globalization hollowed out their industries, were told to learn to code. Not the investor class. Not the people who were promised that markets would never be asked to bear the burden of policy.
Trump, for his part, seemed unfazed. “Now is a great time to get rich,” he said.
And if you squint past the panic, he may have a point. Tariffs are not designed to protect asset prices. They’re designed to rebuild industry, reassert sovereignty, and tilt the playing field back toward production and labor. And, if other countries are willing to give up their mercantilist practices, tariffs could even bring us to something closer to genuinely free trade.
While the pain for investors may not be intentional, it probably could not be avoided. The shares of the corporate incumbents, the winners under the rules of the global economy that prevailed for decades, likely had to decline as their crowns are removed and the principalities are overthrown.
This isn’t about smoothing the path for investors. It’s about building a road to share prosperity that doesn’t lead through Shanghai.
