Happy Friday! Ever wondered what goes on at those massive real-estate conferences for people looking to grow (or start) their real-estate empire? Business Insider's Kathleen Elkins spent a day at one, and the biggest takeaway had nothing to do with the actual housing market.

        In today's big story, forget the Trump trade. The biggest returns might be on the Musk trade.
    

Markets: PE would like to be a big part of your 401(k), but it might need some help from President Trump.
    

Tech: As talk of data center regulation ramps up, Big Tech is turning to the lobbyists.
    

Business: IRS probationary employees are next on the chopping block.
    

        But first, Musk is having a moment.
    

If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.


One of the best investing strategies these days? Trust in Musk.


        In the lead-up to the election, investors piled into assets they thought would benefit from Donald Trump's return to the White House in what was known as the Trump trade. But it's Musk-affiliated assets that have really shined since Donald Trump's November victory, writes Business Insider's Matthew Fox.
    

        From Tesla to X to dogecoin, if Musk is close to it, it's likely been up big since November. (That's also benefited the man himself. His net worth is reportedly up about $135 billion since the election.)
    

        You could argue the Musk trade is just the ultimate Trump trade. (Now we're really getting meta.) After all, one of the main reasons everything Musk touches is skyrocketing is thanks to his proximity to Trump.
    

        But even among executives who have tried to ingratiate themselves with Trump, Musk stands apart.
    

        Take Meta, where Mark Zuckerberg has overhauled the tech giant in what appears to be a bid to align it with the new administration. The company is up more than 20% since Trump's victory, good for second-best among the all-important Magnificent 7.
    

        The top spot? Musk's Tesla, which is up more than 40% during the same time period.
    

Banking on your relationship with a political figure known for unpredictability comes with risks.


        While the Trump relationship has suited Musk well thus far, the president's opinion of people, even those in his administration, can change quickly.
    

        There have been signs of small cracks in the Trump-Musk foundation. Musk essentially killing a government funding bill last December led some Democrats to question whether he was the GOP's real leader. That chatter elicited a forceful pushback from a Trump spokeswoman.
    

        A few weeks later Musk clashed with Trump's base over the future of H-1B visas. (Trump eventually sided with Musk.)
    

        More recently, Trump said Musk opening a Tesla plant in India, another target of his expansive tariff plans and a key future market for Tesla, would be ""unfair"" to the US.
    

        Musk's businesses will also eventually need to address big questions about their future. Tesla, for example, is seeing increased competition from Chinese EVs looking to expand beyond their home country.
    

        And for all the wins X has notched recently, some experts have pointed to its relationship with Musk's buzzy AI startup, xAI, as what's reigniting investors' interest in the platform.
    

        In the meantime, Musk's companies might be happy to point out their owner's powerful relationship when it benefits them.
    

        BI's Peter Kafka wrote about a Wall Street Journal report that Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X, and her lieutenants have been pressing one of the world's biggest ad agencies to get its clients to spend more money on X by using an implied threat of government interference.
    

1. Your 401(k) could look a lot different if private equity gets its wish. In June 2020, President Trump opened the door for alternative assets in 401(k) investing. Five years later, virtually no one has taken up the opportunity. The reason: litigation risk. BI spoke with multiple industry insiders and experts to understand what these private-equity firms want — and what it could mean for the average investor's retirement plans.
    

2. Big-box retail stocks take a tumble. Despite Walmart's earnings beat on Wednesday, the retail giant's full-year outlook disappointed. The guidance had a ripple effect, triggering concerns about a consumer spending slowdown as other retailers — like Target, Costco, and Kroger — saw shares slip on Thursday.
    

3. Investors got the DeepSeek stock sell-off wrong. That's according to Jensen Huang, CEO of chipmaker Nvidia, which was hit by the dramatic market response to DeepSeek's release of a new model built with less advanced chips. Speaking at a virtual event that aired Thursday, Huang said investors misinterpreted DeepSeek's advancements. He said that the AI industry still needs computing power for post-training methods.
    

1. Meta approves bonuses of up to 200% of company executives' salaries. The company said the bonus plan provides ""variable cash incentives"" designed to ""motivate its executive officers to focus on company priorities and to reward them for company results and achievements,"" per a SEC filing.
    

2. A glimpse inside Elon Musk's new Atlanta data center. xAI is joining forces with X to operate a large data center, its second facility after Musk's Memphis project. BI reviewed an agreement with a local economic development agency and found the center will house about 12,000 Nvidia chips. Earlier agreements indicate the center will hold equipment totaling $700 million. It shows how Musk is pooling resources between his AI startup and X to benefit both companies.
    

3. Big Tech's latest lobbying push. A PAC tied to The Data Center Coalition — which counts Amazon, Google, and Microsoft as members — contributed $165,500 to Virginia lawmakers. The contributions mark the group's first political donations and came in the months leading up to the state's annual legislative session. The donations might have paid off, as a slate of bipartisan data center regulation failed to get approval.
    

1. The IRS has begun firing probationary workers. It's the latest agency to be hit with layoffs. The firings also come amid tax-filing season and could specifically hit jobs responsible for enforcement and tax evasion.
    

2. 007 enters a new era. Amazon MGM Studios announced it is taking creative control over the James Bond franchise as longtime producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli step back from decision-making. With the franchise in new hands, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos asked the question we're all dying to know: ""Who'd you pick as the next Bond?""
    

3. Charlie Javice is she-who-shall-not-be-named at Quinn Emanuel. In an email viewed by BI, Javice's legal team told lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan not to discuss the startup founder's criminal fraud trial around the office — lest Javice overhears them. Javice is on trial in Manhattan for fraud, alongside executive Olivier Amar, after selling her college financial aid startup Frank to JPMorgan.

The latest weight-loss drugs including Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound have list prices ranging from $900 to $1,500 for a one-month supply. 

        David Ricks, the CEO of Mounjaro and Zepbound maker Eli Lilly, explained why these medications are so expensive on the ""In Good Company with Nicolai Tangen"" podcast this week.
    

        Developing a new drug costs about $3 billion, takes around 15 years, and has a high chance of failing, Ricks said.
    

        The huge costs, long timeframes, and slim probability of success means ""the return on that risk needs to be substantial,"" said the boss of America's 10th-largest company that's worth nearly $830 billion. The stock has risen 17% in the past year, and more than 500% since 2019.
    

        Once a drug is approved and being used by millions, there will often be calls for cost-plus pricing, Ricks said. But without the prospect of large profits, ""no one would have undertaken the risks to invent it.""
    

        By the time their latest wonder drug is approved and hits the market, pharma companies only have about 10 to 12 years to cash in before their patent expires and rivals can produce cheaper generics, Ricks said.
    

        Drug pricing reflects the limited timeframe they have to recoup their investment, earn sufficient profits to satisfy shareholders, and offset the cost of their many failed medications.
    

        When a drug patent expires, other drugmakers quickly roll out generics at a fraction of the price, stopping the inventor from earning monopoly profits but making the medication accessible to almost anyone who needs it.
    

        ""One of the great gifts of our industry is that everything we invent goes to zero for us and goes to infinity for society because generic drugs are such a great deal,"" Ricks said.
    

        Ricks pointed to Prozac, which Eli Lilly introduced in the late 1980s. The antidepressant is sold around the world and ""virtually free"" as it costs only four or five cents a day in major markets, he said. He called it a ""tremendous gift to society,"" and said his company deserves more credit for those long-term benefits while their drugs are under patent.
    

        When a new medication reduces costs for entire healthcare systems, its creators deserve a share of the savings, Ricks said.
    

        He highlighted research suggesting the new generation of weight-loss drugs reduces worker absences, results in fewer hip and knee replacements, and can help with conditions ranging from alcoholism and depression to schizophrenia.
    

        Their effectiveness in fighting conditions such as heart disease, liver disease, and diabetes could eat into 40% of the total healthcare costs of developed countries, Ricks said.
    

        Eli Lilly aims to ""capture some, not all, of the direct and indirect value we create,"" he added.
    

        Pharma companies could price their drugs based on what the market can bear, but Ricks said that would be unwise.
    

        There could be ""desperate people who need a medication to survive,"" meaning ""you can get into price points that are really exorbitant and maybe make a short-term return, but you'll probably be either legislated or sued out of business if you pursue that forever,"" he said.
    

        Ricks said his team consults with healthcare systems and weighs financial, scientific, and customer perspectives to ensure its prices reflect the value of its drugs without being exploitative and inviting legal or regulatory backlash.

3,2025-02-21,"The Google TV Streamer is the future.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

If you want a Chromecast with Google TV, it's time to hunt one down: both the Chromecast with Google TV HD and its 4K counterpart are no longer available for purchase on the Google Store. The $50 and $30 Chromecast with Google TV streaming dongles are being discontinued in favor of the new Google TV Streamer, as the company announced last year. As spotted by 9to5Google, the official Chromecast with Google TV product page on the Google Store says both models are ""no longer available"" as of Thursday, Feb. 20.
Google announced the Google TV Streamer back in August 2024, and it's a $100 set-top box with Google TV and more features — effectively replacing the Chromecast. At the time, Google said it would still provide support and updates to the Chromecast with Google TV. However, it would only continue to sell the streaming dongle until current stock was exhausted.
It seems as if Google is officially done selling the Chromecast with Google TV, at least through direct channels. It looks like you can still find Chromecast with Google TV HD and Chromecast with Google TV 4K at some third-party retailers, like Walmart, but who knows for how long. Soon, Google will have finished selling Chromecasts for good.

The device replacing the Chromecast with Google TV, the Google TV Streamer, is a bit controversial. At $100, it's significantly more expensive than the Chromecast with Google TV — priced at $30 (HD) or $50 (4K) — which was appealing to budget buyers.
That's because most smart TVs nowadays match the functionality of a budget streaming stick, per the company. However, the Google TV Streamer also isn't quite as powerful as other set-top boxes, like the old Nvidia Shield. We reviewed the device positively overall, but noted it still fell short in a few key areas.
The Google TV Streamer runs Android 14 for TV, an update that existing Chromecast with Google TV devices haven't received yet. While your Chromecast with Google TV will still get future updates, there won't be any new ones to buy now that Google has officially shuttered the brand.

The TV streaming market is a pretty volatile and unpredictable place. From set-top boxes to streaming dongles to smart TVs to smart home projectors, you can never tell which device category will become the king of the living room. The pendulum swings from one end to another, and trends come and go faster than in any other consumer electronics segment. Now we might be facing the end of one such trend, at least if Google’s old dongle is to be the trendsetter.
Although it might not be the first one, the Google Chromecast definitely popularized HDMI streaming dongles that other brands like Roku and even Amazon have tried to get into. That device, however, has been continued and is now officially out of stock, which probably raises the question of whether such devices are, in general, on their way out as well.
Designer: Google






To be blunt, Google doesn’t have a good track record when it comes to its TV-related endeavors, going from a more general “casting” experience to a short-lived Android TV platform to the current Google TV system. Ironically, what remained consistent through the years is the Chromecast devices, even though those have also undergone a few different design iterations.

On paper, HDMI streaming dongles like the Chromecast, Roku Streaming Stick, and Amazon Fire Stick offer the best of all worlds. It could turn any display into a smart TV with streaming capabilities and the ability to receive “casted” content from phones and computers. They had very small, inconspicuous bodies, so they rarely caught your attention and could even be taken with you on trips.







That design, however, also limited what the dongles could do, at least in terms of hardware performance. After all, you can only cram so much in a device the size of a USB stick or a pebble. That’s where the new Google TV Streamer comes in. Launched last year, it offers not only double the RAM and quadruple the internal storage, but it also gets a beefier processor that lets it handle more intensive types of content, like 4K and different HDR standards, without breaking a sweat.

Of course, that also meant that the Google TV Streamer could no longer be a “dongle” and is now closer to a set-top box, swinging the trend back to that side. With almost all TVs getting connectivity features and with set-top boxes becoming more common again, the Chromecast’s final run might also spell the end for others like it, bringing the streaming dongle chapter to a close.

Published onFebruary 21, 2025

Nearly five years after its debut, Google is discontinuing the Chromecast with Google TV. Launched in 2020, it was the first Chromecast to offer a remote-controlled UI. The subsequent HD model released in 2022 ensured users had access to a cheap Android TV streaming device made by Google. Sadly, the time has come to bid farewell to both the Chromecast with Google TV 4K and HD versions.
Google has removed the Chromecast with Google TV from its online store and is no longer selling the 4K and HD streamers. The only Google TV streaming device that’s now available via Google is the new Google TV streamer (h/t 9to5Google). A search for the Chromecast with Google TV on Google Store only brings up a listing for the $19.99 voice remote, which is also unavailable for purchase as of writing this article.
Google had previously confirmed that it would discontinue the Chromecast with Google TV once its inventory was depleted. It appears that time has finally arrived, as the stock of these affordable Android TV streamers seems to have sold out.
The new Google TV Streamer, which replaces the Chromecast with Google TV, is priced at $99.99 — 50% more expensive than the 4K Chromecast model.
If you’re lucky, you may be able to find a Chromecast with Google TV through third-party retailers. However, we couldn’t find any models available online on Amazon or Best Buy.
If you’re already using a 4K or HD Chromecast with Google TV, worry not. Google will continue supporting the devices with software updates. Last year, Google confirmed to Android Authority that the company plans to bring Android 14 to the devices. The update still hasn’t rolled out, and is not expected to bring every new feature in Android TV 14.
The last update that rolled out to both the HD and 4K Chromecasts with Google TV was a security patch in November 2024."
6,2025-02-21,"T-Mobile's 5G powers the automatic ball-strike system in Spring Training. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

For the first time, Major League Baseball players in Spring Training will be able to challenge a ball or strike call on a thrown pitch using an automatic ball-strike (ABS) system. It won't impact the 2025 regular season — the ABS system is currently in the testing stage at Spring Training for about 60% of games — but it is a big deal for the sport. As it turns out, the ABS system is powered by a private T-Mobile 5G network, as the carrier announced today, Feb. 21.
T-Mobile is the official wireless parter of MLB, and thus it's using a private network under its Advanced Network Solution (ANS) umbrella to provide a 5G connection for the ABS system. Hawk-Eye cameras set up by MLB are positioned around Spring Training stadiums to ""triangulate"" the strike zone, T-Mobile says. From there, the private ANS network from T-Mobile transmits data to and from parts of the ABS system over 5G.
Corporate use cases like this one are part of the reason 5G exists. The technology can elicit fast, secure connections between wireless devices. Recently, T-Mobile announced plans to use another private ANS system to power a self-driving car project in Jacksonville, Florida. Now, a similar 5G network will facilitate the ABS system at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Florida, starting today.
For T-Mobile customers and baseball fans, the more exciting announcement might be that MLB.tv is free for the 10th straight season. Subscribers of T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, Home Internet and Small Business plans will be able to redeem season-long MLB.tv access in the T-Life app. Keep your eye out, because a MLB.tv plan typically costs $150 and you can only claim it between March 25 and March 31.

Of course, the MLB.tv subscription doesn't offer most in-market games due to blackouts. You'll still need cable for that, but MLB.tv will work with all out-of-market games during the 2025 season. Considering it's free with your T-Mobile cellular or internet plan, there's no downside to claiming it. And one of the best VPN apps for Android might just solve that blackout problem.
According to T-Mobile, MLB.tv access is one of the most popular free perks offered by the carrier. It says T-Mobile customers streamed 58 million hours of live baseball during the 2024 season, which is a record.

7,2025-02-21,"That's 43% off an iconic Samsung laptop. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

If you're on the hunt for a Samsung laptop deal, you've come to the right place. I just discovered an Amazon deal that carves a ridiculous 43% off the 16-inch Galaxy Book 4 Pro, knocking the price down to its lowest point ever. If you need something a bit smaller, you can also pick up the 14-inch version of the laptop and get a 38% discount instead. Either way, you're getting a powerful, do-it-all laptop with a durable, lightweight build, outstanding Intel Core Ultra processors, and a vibrant 3K AMOLED display. 
Samsung Galaxy Book 4 Pro 16"" (1TB): $1,749.99 $999.99 at Amazon
Buy the top-rated Galaxy Book 4 Pro (16-inch) from Amazon today and you'll score a historic 43% discount, no strings attached. It's hard to say how long this deal will last, so don't wait too long if you're interested! 
✅Recommended if: you want a powerful Samsung laptop with AI features, a lightweight construction, and plenty of ports.
❌Skip this deal if: you want a touchscreen; you can afford the newer Galaxy Book 5 Pro.
Our top pick for the best Samsung laptops on the market today, 2024's Galaxy Book 4 Pro is powered by the excellent Intel Core Ultra 7 processor and utilizes a secondary NPU (neural processing unit) chip to perform AI tasks. The device itself also boasts a ton of ports on both sides of the laptop, including an HDMI, two USB-C, and even a USB-A port. You'd expect that these additions, along with the powerful Dolby Atmos speakers, would create a bulky, heavy laptop, but the Galaxy Book 4 Pro somehow clocks in at just 3.4 pounds for the 16-inch version, making it perfect for tossing into a backpack or briefcase. 
The record-breaking discount on the Book 4 Pro comes just a month after the reveal of the new Galaxy Book 5 series of laptops, a super-premium (and super-powerful) lineup of devices that boast the latest Intel processors, touchscreen displays, and more. The problem is that these new laptops are quite expensive, so we still recommend the Galaxy Book 4 Pro if you want great value and impressive specs.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The Presidents' Day sales may be over, but there's one Google Pixel 9 deal that just keeps hanging on. Pick up the top-rated Google Pixel 9 Pro unlocked from Best Buy or Amazon today and you'll score a straight $200 discount, the same epic price drop that we saw during the Black Friday sales last fall. 
Although I can't say for sure, my sources indicate that any leftover Presidents' Day deals will expire this Sunday, February 23rd, which only gives you a few days to place your order! Once the Pixel 9 Pro discount is gone, it may be a few months before we see another like it, so act fast if you're interested. 
Google Pixel 9 Pro 128GB: $999 $799 at Best Buy
Pick up the unlocked Google Pixel 9 Pro before the deal expires and you'll get a straight $200 off your purchase, no strings attached. That's a return to the flagship's lowest-ever price, plus Best Buy is offering additional savings when you trade in an old or broken phone. 
👀Alternative deal: Get $400 off the Pixel 9 Pro XL plus a year of the Unlimited plan for $15 per month at Mint Mobile
✅Recommended if: you want a sleek flagship phone with great cameras, AI-boosted software features, and seven years of guaranteed OS/security updates; you prefer to buy the best Android phones unlocked.
❌Skip this deal if: you'd rather buy the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL (also $200 off); you can get a better deal through your wireless carrier; you need a phone for gaming.
As described in our glowing 4/5-star review, the Pixel 9 Pro is a distillation of everything that made the past few generations of Google phones so special. The elegant design choices and outstanding camera specs are all still there, but now you get an upgraded chipset, the latest AI software features, and two sizes to choose from. The haptics remain some of the best on the market, and the seven-year software promise means that the phone will continue to feel cutting-edge for many years to come. 
That being said, dropping $800 at Best Buy may be a tall order for some folks, so check with your wireless carrier to see what Google Pixel 9 deals they have before you commit. Verizon, for instance, will give you the phone for free when you add a line with the Unlimited Ultimate plan, while the T-Mobile-owned carrier Mint Mobile will give you $400 off the XL version of the phone, plus some heavily discounted wireless when you pay for a year in advance. The choice is yours, but if you prefer the flexibility allowed by an unlocked phone, then this Best Buy deal is one of the best around.

        The cloud giant estimated the fair value of its stake in Anthropic at $14 billion at the end of December, according to a recent regulatory filing. That's up from $8 billion, the filing shows.  
    

        That means Amazon's investments have soared roughly 75% since it started backing the AI startup in 2023, for a cool $6 billion gain on paper. 
    

        Amazon first invested $1.25 billion in Anthropic in September 2023 and another $2.75 billion in the first quarter of 2024. Late last year, Amazon put in another $1.3 billion, and also agreed to invest an additional $2.7 billion by the end of 2025, the filing stated. 
    

        Amazon's spokesperson declined to comment.
    

        In the filing, Amazon said it used convertible notes to invest in Anthropic. These are classified as ""available-for-sale,"" an accounting term generally denoting securities expected to be held for more than a year. Convertible notes can be exchanged for equity in the future, depending on how they are structured and certain thresholds.
    

        There are a lot of assumptions baked into Amazon's fair value estimates. This is common for investments in startups, which are often young businesses that could either succeed or fail over the long term. Amazon's filing classified the convertible notes as ""Level 3"" assets, which use ""valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants.""
    

        ""These valuations require significant judgment,"" the company added.
    

        Anthropic is one of the leading AI startups, best known for its Claude family of models and related services. The OpenAI rival is currently raising money at a $60 billion valuation, a significant jump from the $18 billion value it saw last year, according to the Wall Street Journal.
    

        Amazon has built a close relationship with Anthropic in recent years. In addition to the funding, Anthropic agreed to use Amazon's cloud computing services and AI chips. Last year, Anthropic said it plans to use a new AI supercomputer made up of Amazon-made chip clusters.
    

        Amazon's total investment value in public and private companies was $22.1 billion as of the end of December, the filing said. Publicly traded companies, such as Rivian, accounted for just $4.6 billion. Among the private companies Amazon invested in are Scale AI, Hugging Face, and X-energy, according to Pitchbook.

Ukraine is launching a new drone supply model that aims to reduce delivery times to troops from months to weeks.

        Rustem Umerov, the Ukrainian defense minister, announced the new system in a Facebook post on Thursday after meeting with representatives from Ukrainian drone manufacturers.
    

        The new model is designed to facilitate the ""fast and uninterrupted supply of the best UAVs for our soldiers,"" Umerov said.
    

        As well as reducing delivery times, the system will help support manufacturers by giving them advanced orders, meaning they can plan production scaling, he added.
    

        It is based on the DOT-Chain supply management system, which Ukraine first introduced in September as part of a push to digitize and streamline the process of supplying the military.
    

        It's not the first time Kyiv has tried to smooth the process of drone acquisition for its troops.
    

        The Ukrainian defense ministry announced in January that its armed forces would receive an additional UAH 2.5 billion (around $60 million) a month to procure new drones, in a move designed to reduce brigades' reliance on centralized acquisition efforts and allow them to purchase the equipment they need directly.
    

        Drone warfare has been at the core of the conflict in Ukraine since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, with both sides using the evolving technology to devastating effect.
    

        The relatively cheap yet highly effective devices have proven to be so popular that Ukraine has significantly ramped up production efforts since the war broke out.
    

        Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in October that Ukraine was capable of producing 4 million drones a year and that Kyiv had contracted 1.5 million so far in 2024. In a Facebook post, Umerov said more than 200,000 drones were delivered to Ukrainian soldiers in December alone.
    

        The country's burgeoning industry has led some to believe that drones could play a role in Ukraine's postwar economic recovery and help it become a key player in the international defense market.

12,2025-02-21,"Target (TGT-0.74%)  was hit with another lawsuit on Thursday, this time by the state of Florida, which accused the retail giant of hiding the risks tied to its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts. The state claims these initiatives sparked a customer backlash that erased billions of dollars from Target’s market value.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Fort Myers, Florida, was brought by the State Board of Administration of Florida, an agency responsible for managing public pension funds, which hold Target stock. 
Florida alleges that Target misled investors and alienated its core customer base by making false and misleading statements in its financial reports about its DEI and environmental, social, and governance (ESG) mandates. The lawsuit also targets Target CEO Brian Cornell, accusing him of downplaying the scope of customer boycotts following the company’s Pride Month campaign in May 2023. The state claims these boycotts contributed to a prolonged decline in Target’s share price.
Target did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The lawsuit is being represented by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier and America First Legal, a group led by President Donald Trump’s advisor, Stephen Miller.
“Corporations that push radical leftist ideology at the expense of financial returns jeopardize the retirement security of Florida’s first responders and teachers,” Uthmeier said in a statement. “My office will stridently pursue corporate reform so that companies get back to the business of doing business — not offensive political theatre.”
This is America First Legal’s second lawsuit against Target. Earlier this month, the City of Riviera Beach Police Pension Fund in Florida filed a similar lawsuit. 
The legal actions come as Target, along with other major corporations such as Walmart (WMT+0.80%), McDonald’s (MCD+1.55%), and Meta (META-1.98%), have recently scaled back their DEI initiatives.

Samsung Apple Android iOS

The smartphone market in Europe grew by 5% in 2024, following four consecutive years of decline. The announcement came from Canalys, which revealed the market saw just over 136 million devices shipped, with 30% of them being premium devices, priced $800 and above.
Samsung remained a leader in 2024, but Apple recorded impressive Q4 2024 sales. This was driven by a positive reception for the iPhone 16, even though ot still lacks Apple Intelligence.
The market saw resilient high-end demand, combined with a replacement cycle of mid-to-low-end smartphones, purchased during the pandemic. Samsung increased its sales by 6% on a yearly basis, while Apple shipped 1% more iPhones.
Xiaomi, the third biggest smartphone vendor in Europe, basically pushed the same amount of Redmi, Poco, and Xiaomi-branded phones as it did in 2023. Motorola saw a 26% increase, while Oppo grew 13% YoY, but Canalys pointed out the number includes OnePlus shipments.
The report points out that 2024 saw the biggest amount of premium devices sold – 41 million, or 30% of the total 136 million. The analysis is based on shipments and not actual store sales, and it includes Apple's push of iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 devices into the channel before they were discontinued due to the USB-C directive; retailers are allowed to sell these devices if they were already on the shelves before December 28, when the directive kicked in.
Samsung's increase in sales was mostly driven by the Galaxy S24 series, which was heavily advertised during the Paris 2024 Olympics.
A detailed analysis into separate countries revealed that Apple has almost double the Samsung shipments in the UK (52% vs 28%), but in Spain, it fell to third place, as Xiaomi shipped more phones than its Korean competitor
Motorola reached an all-time high in Europe in 2024, thanks to expansion through offline stores and open market channels. Oppo's volume returned to growth after two difficult years, seeing a push in Southern Europe – Spain, Italy, Romania, and Portugal. Honor and Realme also grew by double digits, “intensifying competition and creating excitement within the channel and among consumers.”
Companies are facing a “complex 2025” as the EU will introduce an Ecodesign Directive on June 20, pushing manufacturers of mobile devices to prioritize longevity, ease of repair, and responsible resource use. This includes providing spare parts for several years, maintaining longer software support, and offering technical documentation to facilitate repairs by third-party providers.
Shortly put, vendors must launch phones with easily replaceable batteries and multiple years of software support. This is a huge challenge for most companies, and we are about to see them realign their priorities and target revenue growth from services, B2B plans and channel expansions.
Source
yes its funny that they make 1 2 mm thinner phones and on the bus most people carry a power bank:))
Hail the EU and push for consumers protection. Cannot wait to see Apple and Samsung crying, because they need to make phones to last more than few years (batteries) and be easely repairable 🤣
They miss being part of Europe, so they buy ""European"".

15,2025-02-21,"News about how investors are responding to climate change can look pretty grim these days. 
Opportunities in AI have taken up a lot of the oxygen—and capital—in the financial sector, and  the Trump Administration’s move to rip up anything climate related has pushed some investors to turn their backs on climate deals. 
If these developments have you down, consider looking to Tom Steyer for a pick-me-up. 
Steyer, known by many as a 2020 presidential candidate, has since returned to his finance roots—this time as an investor focused on climate change. When we caught up earlier this month at his office in San Francisco, he brushed aside questions about how the new Trump Administration, and the broader climate pullback it has inspired, might challenge his business. He’s focused on economics, and in his telling the financial side of the equation remains solid.
“I would say the numbers about the ability to make this transition are much better than expected,” he tells me, citing the continued record deployment of clean energy technologies. “The rhetoric moves back and forth, but ultimately the facts drive home reality.”
His firm, Galvanize Climate Solutions, has focused in three categories: equities, real estate, and venture and growth. In those areas, the Galvanize team looks for investments that advance the climate cause while generating above market returns—all without relying on policy support from Washington. “This is going to happen if, in fact, we win in the marketplace,” he says. “We're not getting subsidies, we're not getting free money from the government, and we're not counting on anybody being nice.”
Read More: Here Are All of Trump’s Major Moves to Dismantle Climate Action
Take real estate. Galvanize pairs general expertise on the real estate sector with knowledge of the financial opportunities that can come from decarbonizing real estate assets—think of lower costs as a result of energy efficiency and on-site renewable energy. That in turn drives up the price of the asset. “It's just understanding technology, understanding costs, understanding buildings and real estate markets,” he says. 
Steyer is not the only investor sticking with climate, though few are likely to be as full throated in still making their case or as steadfast in their determination. Some big financial institutions have insisted they will continue to pursue deals that advance the climate agenda when the economics pencil out.
But there’s no question that the general enthusiasm that made anything climate-related hot a few years ago has dissipated—and troublingly for climate advocates, the enthusiasm was already waning before the Trump Administration took office in January. A report from PitchBook, which tracks private-market investment data, found that total venture funding for climate-tech fell for the third year in a row last year with funding down more than 17% from the year prior. In the public markets, U.S. ESG funds experienced outflows every quarter last year, according to a report from investment research firm Morningstar.  
And yet Steyer argues that the zeitgeist shift around sustainable investing makes this a great time to be a climate investor. At the core of Steyer’s argument is an assessment of the supply and demand for capital. Right now, he says, there are more investment-grade opportunities in climate and decarbonization than capital available to make those investments. This, he argues, translates into a wide range of opportunities to pick from and better deal terms for investors willing to take the leap. “From the standpoint of an investor, that's a good thing,” he says. “From the standpoint of the country or the world, that's probably not a good thing.”
Over the years, I’ve had a chance to chat with Steyer on several occasions, especially during his political phase. And yet this feels like his most important environmental work. When it comes to convincing the private sector to stick with climate, he tells me, “success is the best argument.”

Maybe Apple has made sufficient iPhone 16e models, since it isn't selling out as normal
Last updated 6 days ago
Now some hours after preorders for the iPhone 16e opened, every configuration remains in stock to deliver on February 28. Back in September 2024, the iPhone 16 Pro Max was selling so well that within 18 minutes certain configurations were sold out.  Apple will always make more, but the delivery date had immediately slipped back a week.That's common with Apple launches, so common that it's practically the norm for the MacBook Pro as well as the iPhone. It even happened with the costly Apple Vision Pro.It hasn't happened with the iPhone 16e.There are six possible configurations of the iPhone 16e, with two colors and three different storage options. After 60 and then 90 minutes since preorders opened, every configuration remains available for delivery on February 28, 2025.What Apple has never and surely now will never reveal is how many of a device it has made. It is fully possible that the iPhone 16e is a massive success and Apple was just brilliant at estimating how many to stock.That would produce the result we're seeing, the ability to get any model without delay. And especially under Tim Cook, Apple has long been totally on top of its whole supply and production chain.Yet despite the kind of iron grip on its manufacturing that other firms would hope for, Apple still routinely hits this issue of delivery dates having to slip back weeks or even months.It could just be good marketing. Apple itself has never exactly crowed about selling out of its iPhones, but a reason for the usual preorder rush is because buyers know to get in early.Except this time. So maybe Apple judged its manufacturing better than ever. And maybe it decided against using scarcity as a marketing tool.Or maybe the iPhone 16e is not selling as well as expected. Just as appears to have happened with the 2024 OLED iPad Pro.

Oh, please!Why would anyone expect this model to sell out or be in short supply on opening day?!It was released outside of the usual September hype and its media coverage.It is not targeted to power users or enthusiasts who will want to upgrade and order on day 1.I would bet the vast majority of customers for this model don't yet know about it or will never know about it until they need/want to buy a new phone for whatever reason. The typical SE customer is not eagerly awaiting the release date of a new phone.

100%. I'm embarrassed for Gallagher that he would even publish this kind of drivel for which he must know the obvious answers. Yeah, this was a big deal in the Apple-obsessed corner of the techosphere echo chamber. But out there in the real world? Not so much. Awareness that the 16e even exists is minimal right now, yet Gallagher wonders aloud why no shipping delays yet as if something must be amiss. Of course, Apple marketing will make sure the 16e becomes a very well-known new model, but that marketing push hasn't really started yet. This kind of stupidity drives me nuts.

I was “eagerly waiting” for a new SE to replace a pair of 2nd generation SEs (2020).  I was ready to make a day one purchase.   Sadly, the 16e isn’t it.   So I bought a pair of refurbished iPhone 13 minis on Amazon instead for less than the rumored price of a 4th generation SE.   Too bad for Apple.   Good for me.   I hope their internal data shows millions of others doing the same.   FYI, it was quite interesting to see the availability of refurbished iPhone 13 mini fluctuate throughout yesterday at Amazon.   There would be just 2 in stock for a few minutes then suddenly more available.   I’m guessing  refurbished late model iPhones are going to be in demand for awhile.  Not everyone wants Apple Intelligence or a hobbled $599 phone.  Mine were $279/each with 256GB storage.  So there!

21,2025-02-21,"Business Insider Edition 
Kapta Space, a space tech startup, emerged from stealth Friday with $5 million in seed funding. MetaVC Partners led the round, with participation from Entrada Ventures and Blue Collective.

        Before this round, the Seattle-based startup raised $500,000 in pre-seed funding in 2023 from MetaVC and other venture firms, along with a $1.8 million grant from the Department of Defense in 2023.
    

        The five-person company is developing an electronically steerable, radar-based imaging technology for space. Unlike conventional antennas that rely on mechanical steering to capture images, Kapta's antenna steers its beam electronically. This approach expands its field of view, enabling faster, more precise scanning of large areas. The system can also rapidly switch between modes to capture images at different resolutions, gathering more high-resolution images in less time than conventional synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems, potentially lowering costs per image and providing a diverse set of data to its customers.
    

        ""We're taking something that's mature and productized for the counter-UAS radar sector,"" Adam Bily, Kapta cofounder and CTO, told Business Insider. ""And we're applying it to some of the needs within the spaceborne radar, Earth observation, imaging, and tracking sectors.""
    

        Kapta's technology could improve radar data used across commercial industries. For example, mining companies rely on space-based radar data from high-end satellites, but these satellites pass over the same location on Earth's surface once every two weeks or so — too infrequent to meet their needs, Bily said. Kapta aims to launch a network of low-cost satellites that will work together to increase imaging and analytics while reducing the time between visits. Kapta's system also supports a three-dimensional imaging technique, which can allow mining companies to track changes in the Earth's surface.
    

        The company's radar also has defense applications, such as tracking ground targets. In 2024, Kapta received a high-level security designation from the Department of Defense to enable future space missions at scale, CEO and cofounder Milton Perque said. Kapta is also working with one of the prime defense contractors on a radar mission, signaling interest from the government to partner with startups on such technology, Perque said.
    

        Perque has worked on multi-function radar systems for over 25 years, most recently at Echodyne, a radar technology company. There, he met Adam Bily, who went on to work at Apple then Astranis Space Technologies, where he led the antenna team and helped develop communications satellites before cofounding Kapta.
    

        While Northrop Grumman, a major defense contractor, has been developing SAR systems and other intelligence technologies for decades, startups are increasingly entering the radar technology market. Capella Space, a San Francisco-based startup, for example, makes satellite radar imagery technology for both commercial and governmental purposes.
    

        With the new funding, Kapta hopes to bring on business development hires who can help navigate deals with government and commercial customers. They also aim to perform demonstrations of their technology in orbit.
    

        ""Space is becoming another warfighting domain,"" Perque said. ""There are going to be lots of other missions that would be enabled by a low-cost, sophisticated sensor like this.""

22,2025-02-21,Dow Jones stocks fell in the stock market today after reports of a DOJ probe into UnitedHealth. SMCI rose as a deadline loomed.
23,2025-02-21,"An Indian pharmaceutical company is manufacturing unlicensed, highly addictive opioids and exporting them illegally to West Africa where they are driving a major public health crisis in countries including Ghana, Nigeria, and Cote D'Ivoire, a BBC Eye investigation has revealed.
Aveo Pharmaceuticals, based in Mumbai, makes a range of pills that go under different brand names and are packaged to look like legitimate medicines. But all contain the same harmful mix of ingredients: tapentadol, a powerful opioid, and carisoprodol, a muscle relaxant so addictive it's banned in Europe.
This combination of drugs is not licensed for use anywhere in the world and can cause breathing difficulties and seizures. An overdose can kill. Despite the risks, these opioids are popular as street drugs in many West African countries, because they are so cheap and widely available. 
The BBC World Service found packets of them, branded with the Aveo logo, for sale on the streets of Ghanaian, Nigerian, and Ivoirian towns and cities.
Having traced the drugs back to Aveo's factory in India, the BBC sent an undercover operative inside the factory, posing as an African businessman looking to supply opioids to Nigeria. Using a hidden camera, the BBC filmed one of Aveo's directors, Vinod Sharma, showing off the same dangerous products the BBC found for sale across West Africa. 
In the secretly recorded footage, the operative tells Sharma that his plan is to sell the pills to teenagers in Nigeria ""who all love this product"". Sharma doesn't flinch. ""OK,"" he replies, before explaining that if users take two or three pills at once, they can ""relax"" and agrees they can get ""high"". Towards the end of the meeting, Sharma says: ""This is very harmful for the health,"" adding ""nowadays, this is business.""
It is a business that is damaging the health and destroying the potential of millions of young people across West Africa.
In the city of Tamale, in northern Ghana, so many young people are taking illegal opioids that one of the city's chiefs, Alhassan Maham, has created a voluntary task force of about 100 local citizens whose mission is to raid drug dealers and take these pills off the streets. 
""The drugs consume the sanity of those who abuse them,"" says Maham, ""like a fire burns when kerosene is poured on it."" One addict in Tamale put it even more simply. The drugs, he said, have ""wasted our lives"".
The BBC team followed the task force as they jumped on to motorbikes and, following a tip off about a drug deal, launched a raid in one of Tamale's poorest neighbourhoods. On the way they passed a young man slumped in a stupor who, according to locals, had taken these drugs.
When the dealer was caught, he was carrying a plastic bag filled with green pills labelled Tafrodol. The packets were stamped with the distinctive logo of Aveo Pharmaceuticals.
It's not just in Tamale that Aveo's pills are causing misery. The BBC found similar products, made by Aveo, have been seized by police elsewhere in Ghana.
We also found evidence that Aveo's pills are for sale on the streets of Nigeria and Cote D'Ivoire, where teenagers dissolve them in an alcoholic energy drink to increase the high. 
Publicly-available export data show that Aveo Pharmaceuticals, along with a sister company called Westfin International, is shipping millions of these tablets to Ghana and other West African countries.
Nigeria, with a population of 225 million people, provides the biggest market for these pills. It has been estimated that about four million Nigerians abuse some form of opioid, according to Nigeria's National Bureau of Statistics. 
The Chairman of Nigeria's Drug and Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig Gen Mohammed Buba Marwa, told the BBC, opioids are ""devastating our youths, our families, it's in every community in Nigeria"".
In 2018, following a BBC Africa Eye investigation into the sale of opioids as street drugs, Nigerian authorities tried to get a grip on a widely abused opioid painkiller called tramadol. 
The government banned the sale of tramadol without prescription, imposed strict limits on the maximum dose, and cracked down on imports of illegal pills. At the same time, Indian authorities tightened export regulations on tramadol.
Not long after this crackdown, Aveo Pharmaceuticals began to export a new pill based on tapentadol, an even stronger opioid, mixed with the muscle-relaxant carisoprodol. 
West African officials are warning that opioid exporters appear to be using these new combination pills as a substitute for tramadol and to evade the crackdown.
In the Aveo factory there were cartons of the combination drugs stacked on top of each other, almost ceiling-high. On his desk, Vinod Sharma laid out packet after packet of the tapentadol-carisoprodol cocktail pills that the company markets under a range of names including Tafrodol, the most popular, as well as TimaKing and Super Royal-225.
He told the BBC's undercover team that ""scientists"" working in his factory could combine different drugs to ""make a new product"".

People outside the UK can watch the documentary on YouTube.
Aveo's new product is even more dangerous than the tramadol it has replaced. According to Dr Lekhansh Shukla, assistant professor at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences in Bengaluru, India, tapentadol ""gives the effects of an opioid"" including very deep sleep. 
""It could be deep enough that people don't breathe, and that leads to drug overdose,"" he explained. ""And along with that, you are giving another agent, carisoprodol, which also gives very deep sleep, relaxation. It sounds like a very dangerous combination.""
Carisoprodol has been banned in Europe because it is addictive. It is approved for use in the US but only for short periods of up to three weeks. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, and hallucinations.
When mixed with tapentadol the withdrawal is even ""more severe"" compared to regular opioids, said Dr Shukla. ""It's a fairly painful experience.""
He said he knew of no clinical trials on the efficacy of this combination. Unlike tramadol, which is legal for use in limited doses, the tapentadol-carisoprodol cocktail ""does not sound like a rational combination"", he said. ""This is not something that is licensed to be used in our country.""
In India, pharmaceutical companies cannot legally manufacture and export unlicensed drugs unless these drugs meet the standards of the importing country. Aveo ships Tafrodol and similar products to Ghana, where this combination of tapentadol and carisoprodol is, according to Ghana's national Drug Enforcement Agency, unlicensed and illegal. By shipping Tafrodol to Ghana, Aveo is breaking Indian law.
We put these allegations to Vinod Sharma and Aveo Pharmaceuticals. They did not respond.  
The Indian drugs regulator, the CDSCO, told us the Indian government recognises its responsibility towards global public health and is committed to ensuring India has a responsible and strong pharmaceutical regulatory system.
It added that exports from India to other countries are closely monitored and that recently tightened regulation is strictly enforced. It also called importing countries to support India's efforts by ensuring they had similarly strong regulatory systems.
The CDSCO stated it has taken up the matter with other countries, including those in West Africa, and is committed to working with them to prevent wrongdoing. The regulator said it will take immediate action against any pharmaceutical firm involved in malpractice.
Aveo is not the only Indian company making and exporting unlicensed opioids. Publicly available export data suggest other pharma companies manufacture similar products, and drugs with different branding are widely available across West Africa. 
These manufacturers are damaging the reputation of India's fast-growing pharmaceutical industry, which makes high-quality generic medicines upon which millions of people worldwide depend and manufactures vaccines which have saved millions of lives. The industry's exports are worth at least $28bn (£22bn) a year.
Speaking about his meeting with Sharma, the BBC's undercover operative, whose identity must remain concealed for his safety, says: ""Nigerian journalists have been reporting on this opioid crisis for more than 20 years but finally, I was face to face… with one of the men at the root of Africa's opioid crisis, one of the men who actually makes this product and ships it into our countries by the container load. He knew the harm it was doing but he didn't seem to care… describing it simply as business.""
Back in Tamale, Ghana, the BBC team followed the local task force on one final raid that turned up even more of Aveo's Tafrodol. That evening they gathered in a local park to burn the drugs they had seized. 
""We are burning it in an open glare for everybody to see,"" said Zickay, one of the leaders, as the packets were doused in petrol and set ablaze, ""so it sends a signal to the sellers and the suppliers: if they get you, they'll burn your drugs"".
But even as the flames destroyed a few hundred packets of Tafrodol, the ""sellers and suppliers"" at the top of this chain, thousands of miles away in India, were churning out millions more - and getting rich on the profits of misery.
The two sides discussed ways to further strengthen the Indo-EU strategic partnership.
Rafael Caro Quintero arrived in New York late on Thursday and was escorted by FBI agents.
The arrival of 200 Indian nurses in Wales is welcomed - but a union warns of far greater shortages.
The incident happened during a public event where the K-pop star hugged 1,000 fans.
The recent spree of deals between the two is upsetting traditional allies wary of Beijing.

24,2025-02-21,"A political tidal wave is crashing across Germany. That's what the hard-right nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party firmly believes.
It is labelled ""radical"", ""racist"" and ""anti-democratic"" by opponents. Germany's domestic intelligence service says the party is ""anti-constitutional"".
But if polls are right, the AfD will become Germany's second largest political force after elections this Sunday.
That would be a huge shift in tectonic plates, not just at home but across Europe.
Why is the AfD such a big deal, you might ask? Parties on the populist right have grown in support across much of Europe.
The AfD points to Donald Trump as well. They share his ""anti-woke"", tough-on-migration, pro-fossil-fuel message. They too are keen to stop sending weapons to Ukraine, and to de-escalate tensions with Russia.
The Trump administration supports them right back - publicly, to the outrage of many Germans.
The thing is, Germany isn't just any other country. 
It is Europe's largest economy, one of its most influential nations. It still carries the weight of its Nazi past. Alongside the UK and France, it's one of the Big Three that helped shape and secure Europe's liberal order and defence structures following both World War Two and the Cold War.
Never before in post-war Germany has a hard-right party been so successful, while on the cusp of being identified as a threat to the Federal Republic and its liberal constitution.
France's influential opposition leader, Marine Le Pen, whose party is also considered far-right, has distanced herself from the AfD on the European stage, apparently judging its positions and ethno-nationalist reputation too radical.
The long-held assumption among the mainstream at home and abroad had been that Germany's dark past immunised it against any serious flirtations with the extreme right.
But there's a lot about this election that's making observers shift their view of Germany. And I will come back to the AfD, which vigorously denies its ""extremist"" label.
Germans have suffered a kick in the gut - in terms of self-image and their country's international reputation.
For years, they got used to being admired - and envied - as the economic powerhouse of Europe.
Vorsprung durch technik, roughly translating as ""progress through technology"", was an advertising slogan for Audi cars in the 1980s. For decades it encapsulated Germany's reputation in the international imagination.
The country was seen as modern, dynamic and technologically advanced. And the automobile industry was one of the main arteries pumping wealth into Germany's economic heart.
But fundamental flaws have now been exposed in the German economic model.
It is widely viewed as kaputt (broken) - relying too heavily on energy-intensive, old-fashioned industries like combustion-engine cars and the chemical industry.
Critics question Germany's lack of foresight, or ability to move with the times. Where was the serious investment in R&D? In big tech? In AI?
To make matters worse, during Angela Merkel's 16 years as chancellor - she stepped down in 2021 - Germany became increasingly dependent on:
All of this left Germany very exposed.
Donald Trump now says Europe can no longer rely on US security support and guarantees.
China has made rapid advances in the automobile industry and dominates electric car technology. So far less need for German imports.
And Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine left Germany scrambling for alternative energy sources. Buying liquid natural gas, from the US and others, is expensive, leading to financial strain on many energy-intensive German businesses.
The result: Germany's economy is sluggish and sticky. As the biggest member of the eurozone currency, that has an impact way beyond its borders. European allies are frustrated.
Germany's military is also a source of irritation (that's putting it politely) among European neighbours. Berlin is a key power in the defence alliance, Nato. Donald Trump's return to the White House means Europeans need to provide more of their own capabilities.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged a zeitenwende - a turning point - for his country's depleted military, after Russia's full scale invasion of Ukraine.
Yet Germany's military remains in a debilitated state - less battle-ready, we are told, than three years ago.
Partly due to its donations to Ukraine.
Germany, after the US, has been the biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine and most political parties in Germany are in favour of continuing to support Kyiv.
The AfD takes a very different stance. ""Peace"" is one of the most frequent signs you see at their rallies. 
They want a rapprochement with Russia, to immediately stop sending weapons to Ukraine, and to use resources instead to build up Germany's armed forces for protection at home.
More than 4,000 bridges in Germany are broken or in a dubious state. I could hardly believe my ears when I first heard that. But it is the reported figure in a country whose infrastructure has been quietly crumbling for years due to chronic under-investment - both public and private.
Train punctuality in Germany is appalling - worse than in the UK, which will astound weary British commuters.
Digitisation is lamentable too. Mobile phone reception is patchy outside cities and people are still known to use faxes!
But even if recent German governments had wanted to invest more, they faced legal limits on spending.
A debt brake was written into the German constitution following the financial crisis of 2008/9, with a constraint on new debt of no more than 0.35% of GDP, except in times of national emergency.
Germans didn't trust their politicians any more.
They had seen government spending spiral at home and abroad. The euro currency, which Germany depends on, almost collapsed.
But what seemed to voters an anchor of financial stability then, now appears to many, a block to economic growth.
Rows about reforming the debt brake were the final straw leading to the collapse of Germany's outgoing coalition, and the snap election this Sunday.
But, new German government beware: breaking the debt brake will be no mean feat. You need a two-thirds majority in parliament to change the German constitution.
Migration is a huge issue in Germany. And a big vote winner for the AfD.
It is far from the only country worrying about migration levels in Europe, but Germany alone took in over a million asylum seekers, mainly from Syria and Afghanistan, during Europe's migrant crisis in 2015/16.
The country has also opened its doors to 1.2 million Ukrainian refugees.
Many Germans were proud of what they called their ""welcome culture"".
But a spate of attacks by asylum seekers from the Middle East and Afghanistan has re-ignited a debate about how open Germany's borders should be.
There have been stabbings, a machete assault, a car ramming into civilians at a Christmas market and again at a recent trade union demonstration in Munich, where yet another small child was killed.
The AfD insists it is not racist or anti-migration, and that anyone is welcome in Germany if they arrive by legal means, get a job, contribute to society and respect local norms and culture.
The party says it would immediately deport all immigrants who commit a crime, and anyone who arrives here illegally.
That stance was applauded by numerous AfD supporters I spoke to at rallies in the lead-up to Sunday's election - including young women who told me they no longer felt safe on the streets.
It's also worth noting that in May, a German court found that ""at least a significant part of the AfD"" believed that anyone with a migrant heritage was not ""properly German"" - even if they held German citizenship. 
It concluded that the AfD aimed to ""grant German citizens with a migration background only a legally devalued status"". This goes against the German constitution.
Worried they could lose voters to the AfD over the question of migration and borders, Germany's centre left and centre right have moved to the right in their rhetoric. This is a victory for the AfD, whatever the outcome of the election.
Even if it becomes the second largest force in parliament, as predicted, it is very, very unlikely to make it into Germany's next government.
The post-World War Two political system in Germany is designed so that no single party can dominate parliament as the Nazis did after they were first voted in, in 1933.
Coalition-building is the name of the game. And there has been a so-called firewall in place since the end of World War Two - a cross-party consensus to keep the extreme right out of government.
The AfD insists it is conservative and libertarian, not a radical, right-wing force.
It points to its growing support base, in west as well as east Germany and among younger voters too. It accuses opponents of trying to shut it up, shut it down and keep it out of power. That, it says, is anti-democratic.
Elon Musk grabbed headlines Europe-wide when he proclaimed in December that only the AfD can save Germany.
The majority here still insists their country needs to be saved from AfD.
Friedrich Merz will try to form a coalition after his Christian Democrats won less than 30% of the vote.
Friedrich Merz heralds a new era for Europe without the US as a key partner, writes Europe editor Katya Adler.
The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is expected to become the second biggest force in the country.
Germany is at a crossroads and now for Friedrich Merz the hard work begins, writes Berlin correspondent Jessica Parker.
Christian Democrats leader Friedrich Merz thanks those who placed their trust in the party and him.

25,2025-02-21,"""Just because you are big enough to build something doesn’t mean people will use it.""

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The place for gaming on PC has been and always will be Steam (if you ask most PC gamers). That doesn't mean others haven't tried. Look at Microsoft and Epic. While one is capable of new states of matter; both are out battling for a piece of the market while Steam sits idly by, effortlessly coasting on their solidified fanbase, rock-solid storefront, and multitude of other features.
Once upon a time, Amazon and Google both looked to Windows PC as a way to expand their yearly revenue. Google's rise and almost immediate fall with Stadia was a whirlwind to the dozen affected users, while Amazon is not admitting defeat altogether. At least, their former Vice President of Gaming is.

In a LinkedIn post, Ethan Evans recalled his loss to Steam when he led the division, ""We were at least 250x bigger, and we tried everything. But ultimately, Goliath lost.""
That is an interesting choice of words when you compare market share. While it's true that Amazon by itself is a company that vastly outsizes Steam, no other company has ever held a portion of the PC market like Steam has. To me, they've always been Goliath; it's just been other Goliaths coming to battle them with similar tools and identical features but a simple change of attire.
Ethan admits to misunderstanding what it took to take on the giant, ""At Amazon, we assumed that size and visibility would be enough to attract customers, but we underestimated the power of existing user habits. We never validated our core assumptions before investing heavily in solutions. The truth is that gamers already had the solution to their problems, and they weren't going to switch platforms just because a new one was available.""

When a person is happy, they don't look elsewhere because something else is available. When a player has a large library of games, achievements, friends, and hours spent on a product platform, what's the reason for the shift?
Often, you'll hear players chant that exclusives can make a platform more appetizing. How well has that worked for Epic? Every week, they give out new games while maintaining a modest amount of PC exclusives like Alan Wake 2. Some others timed, like The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
Despite these benefits, I haven't seen a continental shift to the Epic Games Store. Most of my friends admit they won't even get free games from Epic because it's on Epic. What?

Think about that for a moment: gamers won't even go through the motions of claiming a free game because it's on a different free downloadable program. So, what kind of chance did Amazon have?
In their first attempts at overtaking Steam, Amazon went the route of trying multiple PC fronts, including the buyout of Twitch, ""The first way we tried to enter the online-game-store market was through acquisition. We acquired Reflexive Entertainment (a small PC game store) and tried to scale it. It went nowhere. Then, after buying Twitch, we created our own PC games store. Our assumption was that gamers would naturally buy from us because they were already using Twitch. Wrong.""
Again, they failed to capture an audience even with games dangling on a stick in front of gamers. Twitch games, Amazon Prime freebies, and even Discord attempt this occasionally with free giveaways.

Ethan's final attempt was Luna, ""A game streaming service that let people play without a high-end PC. Around the same time, Google tried the same thing with their product ""Stadia."" Neither gained significant traction. The whole time, Steam dominated despite being a relatively small company (compared to Amazon and Google).""
Here, I think it's odd to compare Luna and Stadia to Steam. Steam has never been a streaming first platform. While you can stream from one device to another via Steam's ""Connect"" ability, cloud gaming has never been at the forefront of the Steam experience.
Even so, it's a storefront. One that, even with the combined convenience of Twitch and Amazon Prime, gamers couldn't relate. They've so far been uninterested in the platform's offerings.Later, Ethan hits the crux of the issue. Gamers, for all their magnificent money, just don't care. ""The mistake was that we underestimated what made consumers use Steam. It was a store, a social network, a library, and a trophy case all in one.""

""At Amazon, we assumed that size and visibility would be enough to attract customers, but we underestimated the power of existing user habits. We never validated our core assumptions before investing heavily in solutions. The truth is that gamers already had the solution to their problems, and they weren't going to switch platforms just because a new one was available,"" Ethan explained.
That is the most reasonable explanation I've seen put forward as to why Steam continues dominating the market. Even when a market participant of equal skill, talent, and features enters the market, it doesn't give gamers a reason to move. If there's nothing new on the other side of the fence, why even look, much less go over?
Every company that's currently trying to outdo the king of PC gaming is larger than that of Steam. While Google has exited the market, Amazon, Microsoft, and Epic continue their endeavor to establish a domain on Windows PC.

Epic with free games, Microsoft with Game Pass, and Amazon with.. well, Amazon has all but officially given up on PC. Even though Ethan Evans no longer works at Amazon, it's fairly clear their push for a PC marketplace has come to a screeching halt.
With their main efforts placed in Twitch and game development, Amazon has continued to publish their games on Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation: New World, Lost Ark, and, in the coming years, a Lord of the Rings MMO. Maybe that will ultimately be the game they can pivot a platform off of.
Lol, I laughed too.
What do you think, gamers? Why did Amazon fail to capture an audience on the PC marketplace? Let us know below in the comments or on social media. I'll make sure to check out the conversation.

26,2025-02-21,"Nvidia (NVDA-7.37%) chief executive Jensen Huang doesn’t have hard feelings for Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek.
After the Hangzhou-based AI startup spooked investors in January, Nvidia’s stock plunged 17%, wiping out nearly $600 billion in value — a record loss for a U.S. company — amid a global  selloff of tech stocks.
In December, DeepSeek said it used a cluster of just under 2,050 of Nvidia’s reduced-capability H800 chips to train its DeepSeek-V3 model — much less than the tens of thousands of more advanced Nvidia chips U.S. firms are using to train similarly-sized models. The AI startup’s models, which it demonstrated to be on par with those from OpenAI and Meta (META-1.98%), prompted questions over the tens of billions of dollars its U.S. rivals are spending on cutting-edge chips and AI infrastructure. 
During an interview with DataDirect Networks chief executive Alex Bouzari, Huang said he thinks DeepSeek’s reasoning models, R1, which it released in January ahead of the stock rout, will lead to more demand for computing power, because reasoning is  “fairly compute intensive.”
“I think the market responded to R1 as in ‘Oh my gosh, AI is finished. It dropped out of the sky, we don’t need to do any computing anymore,’” Huang said. “It’s exactly the opposite.”
Huang also noted that R1 is “the world’s first reasoning model that’s open-source,” meaning developers and consumers can freely use it.
“It is so incredibly exciting, the energy around the world as a result of R1 becoming open-sourced. Incredible,” Huang said.
Earlier this month, JPMorgan U.S. Equity Research (JPM-0.05%) analysts said in a report that DeepSeek is likely to have a positive impact on Nvidia. DeepSeek’s demonstration of cost-efficiency and AI innovation will lead to “strong demand” for higher-performance graphics processing units, or GPUs, the analysts said. Therefore, Nvidia’s leadership in advanced AI chips “should enable them to unlock new use-cases.”
Nvidia is expected to report fiscal fourth quarter earnings next week.

29,2025-02-21,"Business Insider Edition 
The Securities and Exchange Commission is ending a nearly two-year case against Coinbase, a development that's likely a harbinger of the coming era of lighter regulation of digital assets under the Trump Administration.

Coinbase said Friday that the SEC would abandon the Biden-era lawsuit, which alleged that the largest US crypto exchange was an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency.
    

        Shares of the crypto exchange rallied on the news before giving up gains. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said it marked a ""huge day"" for the company, adding that the SEC's case was ""bogus.""
    

        Other industry insiders cheered the news.
    

        ""It never made sense for the SEC to target one of the best run and most compliant players in the industry,"" Eli Cohen, General Counsel at tokenization platform Centrifuge, said. ""This quick dismissal with $0 in fines is another indicator of just how egregious and unusual the Gensler approach to crypto really was.""
    

        ""This action is very welcome as it helps dispel the cloud of legal and regulatory uncertainty that has been hanging over the industry's head for years,"" Chrissy Hill, chief legal officer of Parity Technologies, said.
    

        An SEC enforcement crackdown under former chair Gary Gensler saw similar cases pursued against other crypto firms, including US exchange Kraken, and Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange.
    

        ""There's a common understanding in the industry that there is a wholesale re-examination of enforcement priorities and open investigations and lawsuits, particularly as they impact the digital asset industry,"" said Alan Konevsky, executive vice president and chief legal and corporate affairs officer at tZERO, said.
    

        He added that it's not unreasonable to expect other pending SEC litigation to be dropped.
    

        According to Zack Shapiro, head of policy at the Bitcoin Policy Institute, the Coinbase decision bodes well for other exchanges that have been in the regulator's crosshairs in recent years. However, the legal theory behind the SEC's original complaint remains unchanged.
    

        ""Right now, for token issuers, the rules are all the same, and this is definitely more of a like vibe shift, or enforcement priorities shift from the SEC.""
    

        A key litmus test will be the agency's approach to its ongoing case against Ripple, which issues the XRP altcoin. The SEC's lawsuit claims XRP is an unregistered security, and many have seen the case as the biggest test of the SEC's authority over the crypto market.
    

        ""If they drop that appeal and they settle with Ripple, that would be another sort of different step, because then they're withdrawing specific theories they have that tokens are securities,"" Shapiro said.
    

        Amy Lynch, founder of FrontLine Compliance, expects that most cases related to ""unregistered exchanges"" will be dropped, though those related to crypto fraud should remain ongoing.
    

        As its priorities shift, Lynch said she expects the SEC will turn its attention toward creating a regulatory framework. This month, Commissioner Heather Pierce said that would be the goal of the SEC's newly created Crypto Task Force.
    

        If that pans out, Lynch suspects that the effort could end up creating definitions for when digital assets act as securities and when they are commodities, which would dictate which agency is responsible for oversight.
    

        ""And I think that will be really the determining factor as to how regulation proceeds,"" Lynch told BI.
    

        To Shapiro, Friday's reversal wasn't because the SEC felt it was losing. Instead, the decision to drop the case without a fine signals a big shift in enforcement priorities, he said.
    

        ""Coinbase has been litigating this for a long time. They would have happily paid a huge fine in order to make this go away. This is not about how the litigation was going, this is about the Trump administration not wanting to go after crypto,"" he told Business Insider.
    

        Other sources who spoke with BI were unsurprised by the decision. President Donald Trump, once a crypto-skeptic, made waves during the election by aligning himself closely with the industry.
    

        Even ahead of his inauguration, he had nominated crypto-friendly policymakers, released his own memecoin, and created a working group to oversee regulatory changes.
    

        Meanwhile, a stream of crypto donations aided the shift in sentiment among policymakers. Coinbase was a major political donor in the 2024 campaign, pouring millions into the Fairshake crypto PAC. The company later contributed to the president's inauguration fund and was among the sponsors of the ""Crypto Ball"" days before Trump was sworn in.
    

        While the industry broadly appeared encouraged by Friday's announcement, at least one analyst said there's a risk the regulatory pendulum will swing too far the other way.
    

        ""There will be far less enforcement of crypto scams, digital gambling activities and technical/bureaucratic and substantive offerings of financial products without the proper licenses and regulatory oversight in areas that are gray or unsettled,"" said Terrence Yang, Swan Strategic Advisor at Swan Bitcoin.

30,2025-02-21,"UnitedHealth Group (UNH+1.30%) is under fire over its Medicare billing practices.
The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has launched a civil fraud investigation into how the company records diagnoses that lead to extra payments for its Medicare Advantage plans. 
UnitedHealth stock fell almost 9% in Friday morning trading following the news.
“The government regularly reviews all MA plans to ensure compliance and we consistently perform at the industry’s highest levels on those reviews,” UnitedHealth said in statement. “ We are not aware of the “launch” of any “new” activity as reported by the Journal.”
The statement went on to say “any suggestion that our practices are fraudulent is outrageous and false.”
The DOJ  did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In Medicare Advantage plans, the U.S. government pays private insurers a set amount of money to manage enrollees’ care. However, if a patient has certain diagnoses, the payments increase. 
The Wall Street Journal (NWSA+0.28%) reported a series of articles last year on how Medicare paid UnitedHealth billions of dollars for questionable diagnoses. In December, the outlet analyzed Medicare records and found that patients seen by UnitedHealth-employed doctors saw a sharp rise in lucrative diagnoses after switching to the company’s Medicare Advantage plans. 
Multiple doctors told the Journal that they were trained to document revenue-generating diagnoses. They also said that the company used software to suggest conditions and rewarded doctors with bonuses for considering them. 
Justice Department attorneys have been following up on these findings, interviewing medical providers named in the Journal’s reports as recently as Jan. 31.
This new investigation is separate from the DOJ’s ongoing antitrust probe against the company. Additionally, the department blocked UnitedHealth’s $3.3 billion acquisition of Amedisys, a home health company last year.
UnitedHealth Group is the parent company of UnitedHealthcare, the nation’s largest health insurer, and the pharmacy benefit manager Optum, which has a vast network of medical practices.
The probe comes after a challenging year for the company. One of its subsidiaries, Change Healthcare, suffered a major cyberattack. Its health insurance arm also faced severe public backlash over its insurance claim denial practices following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Avoid costly mistakes in international PPC campaigns by checking these 13 critical Google Ads settings before launching.
Expanding your Google Ads campaigns to international markets sounds exciting – until you realize just how many settings can make or break your results.
If you assume that what works in your home country will work everywhere, think again. From currency mismatches to targeting mishaps, international PPC comes with a unique set of challenges.
To avoid costly mistakes, here are the key Google Ads settings you need to check before launching or optimizing an international campaign.
This may seem like a no-brainer, but many advertisers forget to refine location settings properly.
By default, Google Ads includes users who “show interest in” a location – meaning people outside your target country might see your ads.
What to do: Change your location targeting to “Presence: People in or regularly in your targeted locations” if you only want to reach users physically present in your chosen market. This helps avoid wasting spend on irrelevant clicks.
Your ad schedule may be perfectly optimized for your home market, but time zones shift everything when running internationally.
What’s peak conversion time in New York might be the middle of the night in Paris.
What to do: Set your ad schedule based on the local time zone of the targeted market, ensuring your ads run during business hours or when your audience is most active.
Another best practice is to keep your international PPC campaigns in their own ad account, which can be nested underneath an MCC account.
That way, you can set your time zone at the local time zone at the account level and not have to do complicated time zone conversions if they were to all be in the same ad account.
Trust me, a separate ad account will save you so much time in the long run!
Imagine checking your return on ad spend (ROAS) and thinking you’re crushing it, only to realize later that you’ve been calculating revenue in USD while spending in GBP. Ouch.
What to do: Make sure your Google Ads billing currency matches your reporting metrics. Also, confirm that your conversion values reflect the correct currency to avoid misleading performance insights.
This is another case in point for having a separate Google Ads account for international PPC campaigns, instead of housing every campaign under one ad account.
Google’s language targeting doesn’t translate your ads. It only determines who sees them based on their browser settings.
If you’re targeting users in Spain but only using English keywords, you’re missing a huge chunk of potential customers.
What to do: Set up separate campaigns for different languages within a region, using properly localized ad copy and keywords that match how people search.
Search behavior varies by country. A broad match keyword that works in the U.S. might trigger irrelevant searches in Germany. Even worse, direct translations of keywords can change meaning entirely.
What to do: Research local search behavior before deciding on match types. Use exact and phrase match strategically to control spend in new markets, and analyze search term reports frequently.
Have a solid negative keyword strategy in place at the start to mitigate any keyword match types going rogue.
Bidding strategies that work in one country might not translate well to another due to competition levels, cost-per-click (CPC) differences, and conversion rates.
For example, say you’re using a Target Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) bid strategy for your United States campaigns, and the CPA is set at $50.
It would be unwise to set that same CPA target on international PPC campaigns without knowing purchase behaviors in the region you’re targeting.
There may be less competition in those areas, so you may want to start with a lower CPA target to avoid overspending.
What to do: Start with manual or “Maximize Clicks” to understand market dynamics before switching to automated bidding.
If using Smart Bidding, give the algorithm time to learn and adjust based on local performance trends. Understanding your international markets is key when getting started with Smart Bidding.
For Google Shopping campaigns, simply adding a product feed to a new country isn’t enough.
Product titles, descriptions, and even pricing can impact how well your ads perform.
But localization goes beyond just translation – it’s about using the terminology and structure that aligns with how local shoppers search.
For example, a “sneaker” in the U.S. is a “trainer” in the UK, and European shoppers may prioritize brand and material in product titles more than U.S. shoppers do.
Additionally, some countries have strict rules on tax and shipping display, meaning incorrect settings could lead to product disapprovals.
What to do: Optimize product feeds for each country you plan to run ads in. Ensure titles use local terms, pricing is in the correct currency, and required attributes (such as tax settings) are properly configured.
Also, check product imagery. Some countries have cultural sensitivities that may affect what’s acceptable to showcase.
Different countries have unique regulations for digital advertising, from GDPR in the EU to stricter ad policies in regions like China. Violating these can not only get your ads disapproved but could also lead to legal trouble.
For example, the EU’s GDPR rules require explicit user consent for data collection, meaning that cookie-based remarketing might require additional compliance measures.
Meanwhile, certain industries, like finance or healthcare, have extra advertising restrictions in countries like Canada and Australia.
What to do: Familiarize yourself with country-specific regulations and ensure your ads, landing pages, and data collection methods comply.
Google may also restrict certain industries or ad types in specific markets. Google’s advertising policies page is a good place to start, but consulting a legal expert in your target market is even better.
Google Ads billing methods vary by country, and some regions have restrictions on payment types.
Not all credit cards or invoicing options available in the United States work in other countries.
This account setting is yet another reason why you should consider a separate Google Ads account per region that you plan to run ads in.
What to do: Before launching, check Google Ads’ payment options for each country and ensure your billing setup won’t disrupt your campaigns (if running international ads in the same account).
Your U.S. audience lists might not translate well internationally due to differences in customer behavior and market dynamics.
If you’re using imported lookalike audiences or U.S.-based remarketing lists, they may underperform because user intent differs significantly between markets.
For example, an in-market audience for “luxury watches” in the U.S. may skew toward younger professionals. Whereas in Japan, that same audience might lean more toward older, high-income shoppers.
What to do: Build new audience lists for each market rather than relying on U.S.-based data.
Use Google’s audience insights to refine targeting based on regional behavior and test performance before scaling.
A direct translation of your ad copy isn’t enough; cultural differences impact how messages resonate.
A phrase that works in one country could come across as awkward, or even offensive, elsewhere.
For instance, humor that performs well in U.S. ads may not have the same impact in Germany, where direct and factual messaging tends to work better.
Similarly, a “limited-time offer” urgency tactic in Japan could feel too aggressive, as consumers there often value trust and relationships over hard selling.
What to do: Localize your ad copy beyond just translation. Adapt messaging to fit local customs, humor, and expectations. Also, check that ad assets (like callouts or structured snippets) make sense in the market.
While this may not be a direct Google Ads setting, I felt it was worth including because competitive analysis is crucial when launching in new markets.
CPCs, conversion rates, and ad competition vary significantly by country. If you assume costs and performance will mirror your home market, you might be in for a surprise.
What to do: Use tools like Google Ads Auction Insights, industry benchmarks, and other competitor analysis tools to set realistic expectations for performance in each country.
Again, this isn’t a Google Ads setting to check, but because your ads have to go to some sort of landing page, this is another crucial check before launching your international PPC campaigns.
Sending international users to a generic English landing page (or worse, an untranslated one) is a surefire way to tank conversion rates.
Even if the international region you’re targeting is an English-speaking country, they still may use localized language or phrases different from the United States.
What to do: Ensure landing pages are fully localized with correct language, currency, cultural references, and legal disclaimers. Even small details like using “shopping cart” vs. “basket” can impact conversion rates.
Running Google Ads internationally is more than just expanding targeting. It requires a deep understanding of regional differences in search behavior, competition, and user expectations.
A small oversight in settings can drain budgets fast, so double-checking these key areas ensures your campaigns run smoothly.
With the right approach, international PPC campaigns can unlock massive growth potential.
Just make sure Google Ads isn’t working against you because of pre-applied settings that don’t align with your new market.

Very few driving experiences can match the thunderous roar and the raw power of a Shelby Mustang. To celebrate the 60th anniversary of its true American automotive icon this year, Shelby American debuted a revived GT350 at January's Barrett-Jackson auction in Scottsdale, Arizona. A new Shelby Mustang is also the perfect opportunity to highlight how different Shelby's creations are from Ford's standard Mustang.
We obviously have to start with Carroll Shelby. The Texan was an accomplished sports car driver during the 1950s. Shelby was named Driver of the Year by Sports Illustrated twice in 1956 and 1957. The highlight of his racing career would come in 1959 when he won the 24 Hours of Le Mans behind the wheel of an Aston Martin DBR1 alongside British driver Roy Salvadori.
Shelby's racing career would come to an abrupt end in 1960 after he was diagnosed with angina pectoris, a hereditary condition caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. While no longer able to race, he didn't want to leave the automotive world. Shelby realized there was an opportunity for an American sports car manufacturer to emerge during his time winning races with European machinery. As a result, he founded Shelby American in 1962.

The fledgling company found competitive success with the Cobra and Ford approached Shelby to build a high-performance version of the Mustang. Management at the Blue Oval intended to boost the pony car's racing pedigree and its sales by tying its image to Shelby, but the Texan took the task seriously.
The Mustang's 289 cubic-inch V8 engine was fitted with a larger Holley carburetor, Tri-Y headers, and a high-rise intake manifold. The modifications increased the engine's output to 306 horsepower, 35 horsepower more than stock. The Shelby Mustang wasn't intended to be a drag-strip car. The car also featured larger brakes and an improved suspension for better handling around race tracks.
In the 2000s, Ford used the Shelby name on its own factory-modified performance Mustangs like the GT500 and GT350, but Ford no longer licenses the name for itself, so the moniker is back to only being used by the Shelby American company. The 2025 Shelby Mustang GT350 fits the same mold for performance. This time around, Shelby is bolting a supercharger to Ford's stock 480-horsepower 5.0-liter V8 engine, surging the motor's output up to 810 horsepower. Buyers willing to shell out even more can get a track-focused Mustang as the partnership originally envisioned. The GT350R features a carbon-fiber interior, a half cage, four-point racing harnesses and carbon aero appendages.
Performance does come with a price. If you want to feel like a modern-day Steve McQueen, the GT350 will start at $109,995. You'll have to place your order directly with Shelby American, as Ford doesn't sell Shelbys through its dealers anymore."
34,2025-02-21,"Firefox users must upgrade to newer operating systems to continue receiving critical security updates and technical support beyond March 2025.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

As you may know, Microsoft cut support for Windows 7 in 2020, forcing users to upgrade to a newer operating system for critical security updates and technical support. However, Windows 7 still lurks in Firefox.
Last year, Mozilla highlighted its plan to extend support for legacy versions of Windows and macOS until March 2025, including Windows 7, 8, and 8.1, and macOS 10.12 to 10.14. The company has been shipping important security updates via an Extended Support Release (ESR) version of its browser — Firefox 115.
This means users running Firefox on unsupported Windows operating systems like Windows 7 have until March 4, 2025 to upgrade to supported software.
Mozilla initially planned to cut support for Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 in September 2024 but abruptly changed its plans, leading to the shipment of two ESR releases, including 115 for unsupported operating systems and 128 for Windows 10 and newer.
According to Mozilla:
""Continuing to support it past October isn't going to be free (backporting security fixes is already getting increasingly painful due to the divergence which naturally happens over time as an ESR goes further into its lifecycle), but there's still enough users there that we felt it was worth doing for now at least.""
After Mozilla cuts support for unsupported operating systems, it will move forward with its plans to clean up the code base, lessening the burden on Firefox to maintain newer libraries that aren't supported on pre-Windows 10 releases.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
While the move to offer extended support for unsupported Windows versions might have give Mozilla a slight competitive edge in the browser market share against Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, it's now joining the fray.
Beyond March 4, 2025, users will be forced to upgrade to newer and supported operating systems to continue receiving important security updates and technical support, attempting to install Firefox 116 on these unsupported operating systems will be futile.
Microsoft has aggressively doubled down on its Windows 11 campaign as Windows 10's imminent death edges closer. Users have blatantly expressed their reluctance to upgrade to Windows 11, citing flawed design elements coupled with stringent minimum system requirements.
While Windows 11's market share is subtly on the rise, it remains to be seen whether it will gain broad adoption beyond Windows 10's end of support slated for October 14, 2025.

However, after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election last year, the exchange added back some of those tokens, including Solana's SOL, which the SEC alleged were securities. 
With the Coinbase case set to be dropped, exchanges such as Robinhood feel less risk in adding more tokens to their platform, potentially increasing trading revenue. Most recently, the popular crypto platform said its fourth-quarter revenue rose 115% from the previous year, topping Wall Street's estimates, mainly boosted by a rise in crypto trading revenue. 
According to Cryptorank.io, the top five tokens, based on market cap, that were alleged securities include BNB, Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Tron (TRX) and Toncoin (TON).
The move might also encourage more companies to list their firms publicly in the U.S. markets. Several crypto companies are already rumored to be considering initial public offerings (IPOs) in the U.S., including Blockchain.com, BitGo, Gemini, EToro, Bullish Global (CoinDesk's parent company), Ripple and Circle.

38,2025-02-21,"The best smart display for families is now 28% off its original retail price, falling to a record low"
39,2025-02-21,"The chance that the Federal Reserve will boost interest rates this year to limit inflation is higher than the near-zero level currently priced into the markets.
 That’s according to Jon Brager, a portfolio manager at Palmer Square Capital Management, a Kansas City-based firm that invests in floating rate corporate debt.
The firm’s “base case scenario isn’t that the Fed is going to hike,” but there are signs that central bank officials are starting to consider becoming more restrictive to deal with inflationary pressures, some driven by President Trump’s policy priorities, Brager told Quartz.
Fed policymakers voted last month to hold rates steady, the first time since September they didn’t cut. While many investors still expect at least one more reduction in 2025, minutes from the last meeting showed that officials want more progress on inflation first. CPI picked up in January. 
The U.S. has a structural deficit of about 6% of GDP tied to fixed items like social security, which will be unaffected by DOGE’s assault on discretionary spending, according to Brager. This is stimulative and inflationary, as is immigration action, which may create labor shortages in some industries.
The inflationary boost from Trump’s proposed tariffs may be a one-off, but the country’s overall protectionist turn — including under Joe Biden — creates longer-term pressures, he added. Trump has also shown a desire to run the economy hot to boost nominal growth and is willing to tolerate inflation higher than the Feds target to achieve this, Brager said.
Finally, the Magnificent 7 alone will invest $300 billion plus this year on AI, creating a multiplier effect of about $1 trillion, instead of buying back stock or returning cash to shareholders. When spending from the rest of the tech sector is added, that creates significant private-sector stimulus. 
So while the chance of a hike remains low, the possibility matters because “the bond market is obsessive over Fed policy, and reacts violently to changes in Fed positioning,” Brager said. This has created a lot of volatility in fixed-income funds, which doesn’t affect the floating-rate debt in Palmer Square’s products.

This in-depth post covers every detail of managing Google Shopping for brands that have only one of each product and how to find success.
Google Shopping is a Google Ads product that allows advertisers to serve feed-based ads on the search engine results page (SERPs).
The auction for Shopping Ads works in a similar way to Google Text Ads, in the sense that the auction is query-based.
However, Google Shopping does not target keywords and uses the feed (and a few other factors) to determine when and where to serve ads.
Here’s an example of the Google Shopping results on a SERP:

Google Shopping offers advertisers the freedom to serve:
Google Shopping allows advertisers to inform searchers about their products prior to clicking through – and when compared to standard text ads – has the potential to drive better-qualified traffic.
From multinational retailers to local bakeries, hundreds of thousands of brands use Google Shopping to get their products in front of searchers every day.
Many factors determine how online advertising performs, from key performance indicators (KPIs) to pricing, payment options, imagery, site speed, the social responsibility of a company, and more.
However, looking solely from an ad platform perspective at Google Shopping, the one factor that will determine success is data.
With these basics in place, from the moment you activate your campaigns, you’ll be gathering data and learning.
This learning is the backbone of shopping campaigns, providing Google (and the bidding algorithm) crucial data all the way down to an SKU level.
Over time, you’ll start to uncover a wealth of insights, such as:
This data feeds machine learning as Google understands how your products perform across hundreds of thousands of touchpoints.
This model fits most ecommerce brands with multiple stocks of each item to gather learnings overtime on what works and what doesn’t.
But if you’ve only got one of every product, how can you drive success on Google Shopping when once a product’s gone, it’s gone?
The scale of the business, vertical, market, etc., all play a role in determining the stock of each SKU.
Take a brand like eBay, a global online marketplace with both auction and “buy it now” functionality. They have thousands of items where the stock level is above one, and thousands where it is one of one.
There are thousands of auction houses, second-hand retailers, marketplaces, and more that have a similar setup, but on a smaller scale.
But for this post, we are focussing solely on one of one product.
This campaign type thrives on data, and this flows through every layer, from the bidding strategy down to individual SKU performance.
The feed is the heart of Google Shopping, and with the SKUs changing frequently (depending on the business), accruing data on which SKU performs the best/worst works differently as SKUs sell through and may not be in the feed again for weeks, months, or in some cases, ever again.
There are a number of considerations that need to be taken into account:
These are just a snapshot of the limitations, and there are more.
But that certainly doesn’t mean it’s a non-starter.
A different approach is needed, compared to Google Shopping, for a traditional e-commerce model. Above all, communication and planning will be the backbone for success as these campaigns most certainly don’t fall into “set and forget” paid search management.
Absolutely.
This will require a fresh perspective on how you report, optimize, and plan your media budget, but it’s certainly achievable.
Look at eBay. It spends >$150 million each year on Google Ads, with the majority being through Product Listing Ads (PLAs).
Here are a few approaches that are tried and tested:
Product-level reports are going to be useful for any ecommerce business. However, with products dropping in and out of stock frequently, a focus on categories (or bespoke groupings) is essential.
Say you’re a home furniture auction house with a large inventory. In the mass of data, you’ll need to find trends, and these trends sit within various categories, which are formed from aggregated product data over time.
This could be:
This data will feed into almost all strategies and tactics adopted in the account, from structuring to forecasting and setting bidding targets.
This reporting can be automated and then queried to provide each stakeholder with a different view of performance that all leads back to driving growth through Google Shopping:
Google is going to struggle to gain enough data to optimize at a product level.
Mirroring your reporting, you will need a view of performance at the category (or another grouping) level, as individual product performance isn’t going to feed into your campaigns as it would for a typical ecommerce store sat on the stock.
You’ll need to do the work analysing performance across multiple segments to build a picture of how each category performs to then set budgets and bidding targets and maintain the day-to-day tasks required to manage Google Shopping campaigns.
It is critical that your feed is optimized and you are ingesting as much supplemental data as possible (within reason).
This data will feed into your Google Shopping campaigns, and the time invested will pay for itself down the line.
Take the furniture store example. It can supplement its data with era, designer, etc. When new items are added, this additional data can help group products into segments with realistic targets and budgets vs. being dropped into a top-level category and leaning on product performance to determine what SKUs to serve.
Above all, there has to be ownership and a process for adding SKUs to the feed.
Although products will be moving in and out of your feed frequently, there will likely be cohorts of SKUs that will remain in the feed for a while, which you should keep an eye on as these may need removing/scaling back in line with efficiency.
A great deal of the work involved in navigating this business model and scaling Google Shopping happens outside of the ad accounts.
Advertisers need to interpret and share data across the wider business, and this process works both ways.
What are buyers in the company looking at bringing in and where would this sit with the Google Shopping strategy? Are there categories trending upwards that can be shared with the wider team to capitalize on?
Without stable product data, advertisers will need to think on their feet and get fully ingrained within the business, which in 2025 is essential – whatever the business model.

41,2025-02-21,A recent study has shown that oyster management practices in the Rappahannock River benefit both the health of the oyster reefs as well as the fishery.
42,2025-02-21,"Apple has pulled its Advanced Data Protection feature from the UK market over the latest government demands for backdoor access to people’s iCloud data.
The United Kingdom government has been trying to force Apple into giving it a backdoor to snoop on iPhone users there for years now. Recently, the UK Home Office leveraged the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) to order Apple to give British security officials unfettered access to all encrypted iCloud data globally, which would put everyone’s encrypted backups at risk no matter where they live.
While the Cupertino company can (and will) appeal the decision, doing so won’t delay the order’s implementation. Apple is prohibited from even acknowledging the order, let alone discuss it, so it’s decided to pull Advanced Data Protection from the country. As a result, Apple can now decipher British users’ device backups and other encrypted iCloud data when presented with a valid warrant.
Advanced Data Protection is unavailable as an option for new users in the United Kingdom, but existing iPhone and iPad owners can still use it. Apple has confirmed through the mouth of its spokesperson Julien Trosdorf in a statement to The Verge that Advanced Data Protection is no longer available in the country.
“We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by Advanced Data Protection will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy,” said Trosdorf.
“Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and is hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom,” reads the statement. “As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.”
Dominic Preston, The Verge:
Apple won’t be able to disable Advanced Data Protection automatically on existing iCloud accounts, because of the way the end-to-end encryption feature works. Trosdorf tells The Verge that UK users will be given an amount of time to disable ADP to keep using their iCloud account, though the company has not said when the deadline will be.
To turn Advanced Data Protection off, open the Settings app and hit your Apple account at the top, then select the iCloud option, scroll down, choose “Advanced Data Protection,” and then “Turn off Advanced Data Protection.”
Apple uses end-to-end encryption by default to protect most of the data iPhone and iPad owners store in iCloud from snooping. End-to-end encryption makes data unreadable on your device, in transit (while being uploaded to iCloud) and at rest (while stored on Apple’s servers) without the encryption key.
By default, standard data protection is used to encrypt certain iCloud data like passwords, iMessage archives and health and payment information. With standard data protection, encryption keys are securely stored in Apple’s data centers.
This enables the company to help you with data recovery and respond to valid data requests from law enforcement. However, standard data protection does not use end-to-end encryption to protect crucial data stored in iCloud, including your Photos database, notes and reminders, device backups, content in your iCloud Drive, Safari bookmarks, voice memos and more.
Contrast this with the Advanced Data Protection feature, which is Apple’s highest cloud data security level available on iOS 16.2, iPadOS 16.2 and macOS 13.1 and later.  It can protect “the vast majority of your iCloud data,” according to Apple’s support page. Concretely, device backups stored in iCloud and synced content from Photos, Messages, Notes and other apps are encrypted end-to-end.
No one, not even Apple, can decrypt this data because the Advanced Data Protection feature moves the encryption keys from Apple’s servers to your device. Encrypte data can only be decrypted on trusted devices where you’ve signed in to your Apple Account. Because of that, Apple is technically able to fulfill valid requests to, say, give the police access to a suspect’s iPhone backup from iCloud.
“No one else can access your end-to-end encrypted data–not even Apple–and this data remains secure even in the case of a data breach in the cloud,” explains Apple. “If you lose access to your account, only you can recover this data using your device passcode or password, recovery contact or recovery key.”
Advanced Data Protection requires iOS 16.2, iPadOS 16.2, and macOS 13.1 or later. To turn it on, hit your Apple account at the top of the Settings app, choose “iCloud,” scroll down and select “Advanced Data Protection” to turn the feature on.

Earlier this month, Elon Musk posted on X that he ""deleted"" the group responsible for creating the IRS Direct File system. The IRS Direct File program offers a free way to file your taxes directly with the IRS. This program still exists for now, but you still might prefer to file with a third-party company instead.
Even the best tax software from traditional tax filing companies can have complicated fee structures, which may leave you confused about how much you'll need to pay to file your taxes.
If you're looking for other options, some financial technology companies have started to offer free tax filing services for their customers. Depending on who you have a checking account or savings account with, you might already qualify to file your taxes for free.
We've provided a rundown of what tax filing options are available for free through fintech companies in 2025 to help you plan how to file your taxes this year.
For most of these companies, the only thing you need to do in order to qualify for free tax filing is to use one of their other products.
Most of our options offer free banking products, but keep in mind that opening a bank account requires giving up sensitive personal information. If you don't trust a specific company with your financial information, it probably isn't worth opening an account with them to take advantage of their tax filing service.
If you qualify to file your taxes with one of these companies, you still might not be a good fit for the services they offer. Most of these companies offer do-it-yourself, or DIY, tax filing. This means you generally won't be filing with the help of a tax professional.
If you don't have a strong grasp on your tax situation or think you'll need more help filing your taxes, you'll probably want to go with another service.

Chime has one of the best checking accounts out there, but it doesn't offer joint accounts or pay the best savings rate. Its strongest feature is that it's great for people who might not qualify to open accounts elsewhere — it doesn't check your credit score or banking history when you apply for a checking account, savings account, or credit card. It also provides several credit-building tools.
Several financial technology companies, including Chime, Varo, and Cash App, are offering free tax filing services this year. Here are some standout products these fintech companies offer if you're interested in filing taxes with them.
We've found that Chime has one of the best checking accounts for second-chance banking. The Chime® Checking Account charges no monthly service fee and no overdraft fees while offering up to $200 in overdraft protection if you qualify.
You also won't need to pass a credit check to open an account with Chime, which makes it a good choice if you have poor banking history.
Varo Bank offers one of the best high-yield savings accounts you can get. The Varo Savings Account offers 2.50% to 5.00% APY. It's rare to still find savings accounts that offer 5% interest, and those that do are frequently local institutions.
There is one drawback to this 5% interest savings account: you'll only earn that high rate on the first $5,000 in the account. You'll earn 2.50% APY on the rest. This is still high compared to average savings rates, but it's lower than what you can get at other fintechs or online banks.
Cash App is a fintech app primarily used to transfer money, but it also provides banking services and works as an investment app for beginners. Unlike other options on this list, Cash App handles its tax filing in-house instead of partnering with another company.
Cash App Taxes is potentially the easiest service to access on our list. There's a good chance you're already using Cash App as a money transfer service, and you don't need to open a bank account with Cash App to use its tax services. You may need to provide information for an external bank account to pay your taxes or receive a tax return if you don't choose to direct deposit your refund into Cash App, though.
You can also get tax filing services through MoneyLion and Origin Financial. MoneyLion is a fintech app with services like MoneyLion Credit Builder and MoneyLion Instacash, while Origin Financial is a budgeting app.
While Origin Financial does not upcharge for its tax filing services, it is not a free budgeting app. You'll need to pay around $13 a month or $99 a year for an Origin membership. It also offers an additional service that lets you get help from a tax expert when filing, but you'll need to pay $189 to get it.
No charge for filing taxes and supports a wide range of tax situations and major IRS forms
$0
Cash App Taxes offers free, straightforward federal and state tax filing. It doesn't support multiple state returns, part-year state returns, or foreign earned income.
Most of these fintech companies offer tax services through Column Tax, a company that partners with financial technology companies to provide tax filing services to their customers. The only exceptions are Cash App, which handles tax services in-house, and Chime, which works with another tax company called April in addition to partnering with Column Tax.
As such, you'll probably have a fairly similar experience filing taxes with each of these fintech companies.
You won't need to pay for either federal or state filing with most of these options. Column Tax is an IRS-authorized e-file provider, and it has an Accuracy Guarantee that you'll be reimbursed for up to $10,000 of IRS or state interest and penalties if there is a computational error on Column Tax's part.
It will also reimburse you if you find that another tax preparer calculates a better refund than it did.
Column Tax covers many personal tax situations, including salary and self-employed taxes, itemized deductions, and crypto or stock sales.
Many of these companies, such as Varo and Chime, will let you get your federal tax refund several days early if you choose to direct deposit it into the bank account you have with the company.

Social media is evolving. Are you adapting? Connect with a community of brand pros and content creators at Social Media Week, May 12–14 in NYC, to learn how to keep pace with new trends and technology. Register now to save 20% on your pass.
Beiersdorf chief digital officer Axel Adida has a tall order: market the conglomerate’s brands, including Nivea, Eucerin, and Aquaphor, across 89 markets—and prove that those efforts are working. 
“We produce content on every continent, [in a] multitude of languages, for many different brands,” Adida said. “The question is: how do you make sure that the content you put on different social networks is working?”
Because creative is subjective, measuring impact can be a challenge. That, in addition to shifting consumer attention spans and media fragmentation, can make finding the right approach elusive.
“That changes the way you build the narratives [and] the images that you show,” Adida said. “[We] also show them on a very small screen. So the question is, how do you adjust your advertising, creative ideas, and machines to be more attuned to what consumers like?”
Back in 2023, Beiersdorf partnered with CreativeX, an AI-powered tech company that helps brands analyze how creative is performing on social and optimize accordingly, to understand exactly that.
Beiersdorf’s primary focus here so far has been on Nivea, for which CreativeX has run over 100,000 in-flight tests across Google, Facebook, and Instagram. In 2025, the brand aims to test all of its social media campaigns via CreativeX pre-launch, including 14 global campaigns and several regional ads.  It also plans to extend its in-flight testing across TikTok and Pinterest.
Nivea’s social media strategy involves maintaining a strong presence across channels including Facebook, Instagram, X, TikTok, and Pinterest, while collaborating with beauty influencers and creators.

AI-Powered Content Provider ITG Expands to U.S.
  

CreativeX determines the effectiveness of that work by compiling all of Nivea’s assets, including images, text, and video, and analyzing them for quality elements like sizing, optimal video length, and sound quality.
It then works to ensure creative is aligned with Nivea’s brand-specific guidelines. 
“What are some things that Nivea wants to measure that they would like mass data to be able to answer?” said Anastasia Leng, CEO of CreativeX. “Is this new brand identity working? How are these different creative elements resonating? Things like that.”
According to Beiersdorf, the partnership with CreativeX has led to significant media spend savings for Nivea, though it declined to disclose a specific figure. According to COMvergence, Nivea’s estimated ad spend for 2024 was $22 million.
“We can measure anything, but just because we can measure it, doesn’t mean it’s going to be valuable to the brand,” added Leng. “So we start with things that are really proven to drive creative impact.”
For instance, CreativeX has provided Nivea with data that shows videos sized at a 9:16 aspect ratio are ideal for vertical video platforms like YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, and TikTok Stories. The brand has also been able to identify “safe zones” on each social platform—in other words, where to position creative so important elements, like logos, are not blocked by platform widgets, like share buttons.
Nivea relies on other partners to measure data like click patterns or how long viewers are watching its posts, but CreativeX can ingest that information into its platform to analyze overall creative effectiveness. 
Thanks to these insights, according to Nivea, from Q2 2022 to Q4 2024, adherence to its “CTA: In Creative Text” best practice, which ensures that all social media creative includes a call-to-action in the last 5 seconds the ad, has increased by 23%.

Brand advertisers are reviewing their organic and paid search strategies in response to web users turning away from Google.
According to an estimate from Statcounter, Google’s share of the search engine market dropped to 89% at the close of 2024, the first time it had fallen below 90% in 10 years.
Google’s market share decrease belies big changes in the way that users search for information online. Today’s consumers use a wider variety of search tools than they did in previous years, from TikTok to Perplexity to Amazon, depending on their goals. Research published by Omnicom in January suggested clients accordingly consider investing their search across a more diverse set of channels.
Because the tech giant has been synonymous with search, it’s the player with the most to lose — but advertisers are on the hook, too. A spokesperson for Google didn’t immediately return a request for comment on this story.
According to nine media buyers and SEO experts who spoke with Digiday, brand marketers are beginning to notice the impact of changes in search behavior. In response, some are altering investment plans and asking their agencies to rethink their organic search presence, or appointing new shops to SEO briefs.
SEO has gone from being “the last thing brands thought about” to a key lever in clients’ response to a changing search environment, said Catherine Lux, head of SEO at Assembly. 
This month Assembly recently expanded its brief with Brooks Running to include SEO in Europe — its North American business already handled paid media for the footwear brand — while media agency PMG’s European business picked up meal subscription service Gousto as a client.
“We are seeing more clients unlocking extra budget for new projects and different ways of working,” said Lux.
Agency execs say that work often translates to auditing client websites to ensure they’re easier for LLMs to scan: adding clearly structured data, fewer standalone landing pages, blog posts or pages featuring concise FAQs, more bylined blogs and more material that mirrors the conversational tone used by AI chatbots and search tools.
“We need that cohesive site content that is super up to date and relevant and chock full of all of the keywords that folks want to be serving on for organic,” said Grace Mante, director of media agency Kepler’s Search Center of Excellence.
Much of this work is already considered best practice by agencies, but they’re now emphasizing its importance — the idea being, that an optimized digital presence can better influence the way that Gemini or ChatGPT can “read” a client’s content, and the way they reflect a brand back to a user.
“Great SEO is what is going to inform the large language models,” said Matt Allfrey, head of SEO, EMEA at PMG.
And what of advertisers’ spending on paid search? According to some media buyers, they’re shifting it into other pockets of marketing investment. Both social platforms and retail media networks provide tempting destinations (eMarketer estimated that Walmart’s search ad business would expand 30.4%  last year, for example).
In some cases, that means investment in different Google products. Mante said Kepler clients were prioritizing Google’s Performance Max and Demand Gen ad formats, though she didn’t provide spend estimates. 
YouTube could be another beneficiary. According to Chris Actis, president of agency True Media, while spend assigned for local or regionally targeted search ads had held steady, the agency had begun to shift client investment out of brand search (the practice of placing ads against keyword searches or brand-name searches) and into other channels. “Brand search is an opportunity for marketers to shift [spend],” Actis said.
He said that in 2024, an unnamed travel client shifted half of its branded search spend into digital display and video inventory, principally YouTube.
Given the rising cost of search ads — both IPG’s Magna media investment unit and PMG’s Allfrey estimated that brand CPCs have risen 6% year-on-year — that’s not been too difficult an argument to make. For other clients, that cash is going where users have gone — to paid search ads on TikTok, Reddit or Instagram.
Måns Gårdfeldt, partner at indie digital agency Spekk, estimated that his agency’s clients had reduced their spending on brand search by 10-20%, prompted by a reduction in search engine usage, and transferred their investments into paid social. “Social search will only grow, in my book,” he said.
Dan Roberts, Assembly head of search and programmatic, said the agency’s clients were devoting “incremental” budgets to experimental channels, such as paid ads on Perplexity, as they considered their course changes; he didn’t provide budget estimates.
While Google’s market share fall may yet prove to be a blip, it’s likely a sign of different online habits taking hold among web users.
The migration to AI search tools and social platforms points to demand for a different online experience — one with the conversation, not the directory, as its bedrock. According to Dan Toplitt, svp, head of search and digital experience at Kinesso, it calls into question “what search actually is.”
In that context, both SEO, paid search and social will likely need to work in closer concert rather than as separate disciplines. Toplitt concluded that the challenge calls for a “more holistic” approach to those channels, and for brand marketers to consider how each one dovetails the other.

47,2025-02-21,"You can use Google Chrome extensions on Microsoft Edge, but the new Edge Add-ons website may cause you to convert.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

One of the best parts of Microsoft Edge getting revamped a few years ago was the addition of support for Chrome extensions. But just because you can use the Chrome Webs Store to find extensions that work on Edge doesn't mean Microsoft wants you to. The tech giant has revamped its Edge Add-ons website to make it easier to navigate.
The new Edge Add-on site is rolling out gradually, so you may not see it yet.
""We’re excited to announce the launch of our newly revamped Edge Add-ons website, designed to enhance your browsing experience through extensions and themes,"" explains Microsoft in a blog post. ""This update brings a host of improvements aimed at making it easier for you to discover and acquire add-ons like extensions and themes through a more modern, functional, and actionable store.""

The new version of the Edge Add-ons website has enhanced autosuggestions that appear as you type. The top suggestion will have a ""Get"" button next to it that allows you to install the extension without having to jump to a different page.
Search results can now be filtered by product type, category, ratings, and other options.
Locating themes should be easier as well, as they're now categorized better. I hope Microsoft does something similar with the themes in the Microsoft Store. The tech giant is retiring its free wallpaper site and the equivalent in the Microsoft Store is poorly organized and lacks categories.

The Edge Add-ons site is a bit redundant for some users. Microsoft Edge can run Google Chrome extensions, so many people just use the Chrome Web Store to install extensions onto Edge. But if you prefer Microsoft's interface or if you want to completely remove Google from your life, the Edge Add-on store is there.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
There are extensions that are only available through the Chrome Web Store. Edge has a smaller user market share than Chrome, so developers often target Google's browser. In those cases, people can grab the extension through the Chrome Web Store and use it on Edge, Chrome, or one of many other Chromium browsers.
While Chrome has a bigger market share than Edge, it's also controlled by Google. That means if Google blocks an extension from working, such as uBlock Origin, your best option to continue to use that extension could be to use another browser. At least for now, uBlock Origin works on Edge, though that could change in the future.

48,2025-02-21,"Circana executive director Mat Piscatella explains in a recent interview that Fortnite is the biggest challenge for any new game to overcome.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The biggest challenge to a new game on the market is Epic Games' ongoing free-to-play juggernaut Fortnite. That's according to Circana executive director and analyst Mat Piscatella.
Speaking with Greg Miller on Kinda Funny Games about everything going on across the gaming industry, Piscatella laid out some sobering figures for the video game audience in the U.S, pointing out that 30% of players won't buy a game this year.
The players that do? Only 12% of them are buying a game once a month. The vast majority of players buy only one or two games, meaning free-to-play games like Fortnite are fighting every new release for attention.
""The biggest competitor to any new video game is Fortnite. I will die on that hill, no matter what it is, because you have to fight Fortnite before you fight anything else to get your game seen and purchased, and that's the biggest challenge happening right now,"" Piscatella explains, noting that in the current market, getting an hour of playtime for your game means taking it from something else.
While Fortnite first launched in 2017 as a survival game, the Battle Royale mode rapidly exploded in popularity, rapidly grabbing million of players and bringing in billions of dollars of revenue, cementing Epic Games' place as a live service developer.
Fortnite is now one of the most played games on all platforms, regularly fighting with Call of Duty HQ — Activision's launcher for all recent Call of Duty games — for first place on Xbox and PlayStation consoles, per Piscatella's reports via Circana data.

The phrase ""Black hole"" games refers to any big game that gets a disproportionately large chunk of player engagement, in terms of hours spent and overall spending. The majority of the black hole games are free-to-play, with titles like Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone taking up a large amount of time and money from other games.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
I've previously written about the problems the industry faces with black hole games, and how there's not a clear solution to the problem. If Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto 6 does launch this year, it'll very interesting to observe exactly how the game alters player behavior.
There's been some new live service successes, with Marvel Rivals now one of the most-played games on all platforms, but failures like PlayStation's Concord have been far more frequent over the last couple of years.

By Michael Erman, Patrick Wingrove and Marisa Taylor
(Reuters) - Elon Musk's DOGE team has slashed hundreds of jobs paid for by fees from banks, medical device companies and other forms of funding rather than taxpayer dollars, raising the question of whether the cuts will render hoped for savings.
Most of around 200 Food and Drug Administration employees fired over the weekend held jobs that were paid for by fees charged to medical device makers under a 2002 law, according to former employees and sources familiar with the matter, depleting staff needed to approve medically necessary products like stents and implants for consumers. Overall, the FDA has around 20,000 workers.
""The overwhelming majority of those who will be terminated as a result of this are recent hires ... funded through user fees. So as a result of that, the federal government will not save money,"" said Scott Whitaker, CEO of the medical device industry group AdvaMed.
""If these cuts are not reversed there's no question that it will slow down the process for new technologies to get to market and to get to patients,"" he added.
Two financial regulatory agencies that do not rely on direct taxpayer dollars also cut staff in recent days. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is funded by the Federal Reserve, fired dozens of probationary and term-contract workers and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation fired over 100 probationary workers as part of the government-wide staff reductions. Banking fees fund FDIC operations.
U.S. President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, one of his closest advisers, have mounted a sweeping campaign to slash the size of the 2.3 million-strong federal workforce, firing thousands of employees in an unprecedented effort that shows no sign of slowing.
Their layoffs at the FDA include employees reviewing Elon Musk’s brain implant company Neuralink. The CFPB overhaul comes as Musk’s X recently announced a deal with Visa to provide payment services to customers of the social media platform. The CFPB is the primary federal regulator tasked with policing consumer protection laws for nonbank financial firms.
While there is general agreement among Democrats and Republicans that the U.S. government is rife with waste and over-staffed, the haste and sweep of cuts in recent weeks has raised questions from agency staff and some lawmakers about the purpose of the reductions and the savings they will produce.
""The FDIC is funded through fees paid by banks, so cutting the FDIC's expenses does nothing to reduce the federal budget,"" said Jeremy Kress, a law professor at the University of Michigan.
FDIC declined to comment. The White House and CFPB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The total number of firings at the FDA is unknown. But one industry source said that at least 180 of the fired FDA employees held jobs funded by the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act, under which the companies pay for the review of their products. A manager at the FDA, who spoke on condition on anonymity, said she was also told 180 and that she had not been told what would happen to the fees already paid.
Reuters spoke to five former employees of the FDA who confirmed they had been fired from their MDUFA-funded roles.
One, who declined to be named for fear of retribution, said during their last year of tenure, their team had reviewed 100 files that collectively generated more than $1 million in revenue for the agency. Files include new device submissions, marketing applications and other materials medical device companies need approved before bringing products to consumers. Reuters could not independently verify the amount.
As part of the agreement with medical device makers, overseen by Congress, the FDA aimed to meet hiring targets for each year of the latest iteration of MDUFA. Many of those hires from 2023 and 2024 would still have been probationary employees and would likely have been cut.
According to the latest financial document for the agreement posted by the FDA, the agency hired 141 employees to meet the MDUFA guidelines in 2023 and was targeting another 42 last year.
Nine other former employees for the U.S. departments of Health and Human Services, the Interior, and Agriculture, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said they were also fired despite their roles being funded by user fees, non-governmental grants and other forms of private funding.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Agriculture said they seek ""to ensure that every dollar spent goes to serve the people, not the bureaucracy.""
Some of their jobs had been to regulate tobacco products and inspect imports of plant and animal products to prevent the spread of invasive species and plant diseases to the United States. One was responsible for the conservation of endangered species in Yosemite National Park.
The FDA collects hundreds of millions of dollars each year from the companies under the MDUFA Act. It was projected to collect nearly $400 million in user fees from the medical device makers last year, most of which goes to payroll and operating expenses for employees at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
A spokesperson for the agency was not immediately available to comment.

51,2025-02-21,"iPhone 16e pre-order day is here, and we have already detailed some of the new magnetic case collections from Spigen and others, but it’s now time for the deals. Alongside iPhone 16e screen protectors from $3 each as well as MagSafe cases from $10, we also have the return of Apple Watch Series 10 Black Friday pricing from $329. Those offers also join the $200 price drops on M3 MacBook Air models and the most affordable M4 MacBook Pro at 1,399, as well as deals on AirTags, ongoing M4 Mac mini discounts, and an iPhone 15 offer at $299 off the original list price. All of that and more awaits below in today’s 9to5Toys Lunch Break.
After seeing a number of band options and case color/sizes go out of stock, Amazon seems to have refreshed its selection of  Apple Watch Series 10 configs at the discounted prices. While not every single band option is back there is a good selection now live once again  starting down at  $329 across both the  42mm and  46mm size options – this is matching the Black Friday and holiday pricing from last year, landing on par with the best deals we have tracked at Amazon in brand-new condition since release.
While there have been some notable open-box discounts on Series 10 units via Best Buy with Apple warranties this year, there’s nothing quite like opening a brand-new Apple Watch when you can score it with a solid deal. That said, the open-box pricing on the  42mm model in silver or  rose gold as well as the  Jet Black open-box units have now jumped back up to something far too close to the discounted prices on the new units for us to recommend at this point anyway.
The brand-new models at Amazon are seeing the same $70 price drops we tracked for Black Friday last year – this includes the most affordable base models as well as the GPS + Cell variants, both of which in either the 42mm or 46mm sizes:
Pre-orders on the  new iPhone 16e go live today, but we have just spotted a notable opportunity to save on an  iPhone 15 for even less. While the  iPhone 16e does have a few things going for it, mainly that A18 chip with Apple Intelligence support, if you don’t care about many would argue the iPhone 15 is actually a more powerful device and you can now  score a Renewed Premium model over at Woot for  $499.99 Prime shipped with a 1-year warranty (a $6 delivery fee will apply) – that’s $299 under the original price the iPhone 15 launched at.
The base iPhone 15 debuted with a $799 list price, or $200 more than the base model iPhone 16e will go up for pre-order at today. Today’s deal is nearly $300 under the original list price, $20 under our previous mention on a renewed iPhone 15, and $100 less than purchasing the brand new iPhone 16e.
We certainly wouldn’t blame you for favoring the brand new iPhone 16e, but there are more than a few things the iPhone 15 has over it – built-in MagSafe support, the Dynamic Island, dual camera setup, and all five color options are  down at the  $499.99 sale price here today.
After quickly jumping back up in price, we are now once again tracking the  base model 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro down at  $1,399 shipped in silver and Space Black. While shipping is currently delayed on the silver model, the Space Black is ready to be delivered at the discounted rate right now. This is a regularly $1,599 configuration seeing a straight up $200 price drop to mark the lowest price we can find on Apple’s latest and most affordable M4-equipped laptop.

EXCLUSIVE: Another hot package is getting ready to hit the market as Deadline is hearing MRC and T-Street are putting together A Place in Hell, the next film from Fair Play director Chloe Domont, starring Michelle Williams and Daisy Edgar-Jones. Domont will write and direct with MRC financing and T-Street producing.

	Described as a thriller following two women at a high-profile criminal law firm, sources say the package is expected to hit the market in coming weeks.

	Domont’s most recent film Fair Play was one of the breakout hits at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival, with Netflix ultimately making it one of the major acquisitions of the festival. Once word got out last fall that Domont had her next film lined up, it wasn’t long before top tier talent like Williams and Edgar-Jones were on board.

	










	Williams is a five-time Oscar nominee for My Week with Marilyn, Blue Valentine, Brokeback Mountain, Manchester by the Sea and The Fablemans and also starred in The Greatest Showman and the first two Venom films. She next will be seen in the FX limited series Dying for Sex. Williams is repped by CAA.

She can be seen next in On Swift Horses opposite Jacob Elordi and just finished her run starring Cat On A Hot Tin Roof. She is repped by UTA, Hamilton Hodell and Sloane, Offer, Weber, Dern.

Cars are pretty special, at least, we think so. But as precious as every vehicle to ever roll off the assembly line is, some just don't stick with you. Some are the automotive equivalent of an appliance meant not for driving enjoyment, but just to get from point A to point B without any trouble. The Chevy Malibu I recently rented was such a car; so boring and forgettable I once walked right past it in the parking lot while I was looking for it. Sometimes it's the automakers fault as they don't advertise the car like they should. It'll be a model that's still in production, something you can walk onto the lot and buy new with a warranty but you can completely forget it exists. Chevy's SS is a perfect example of this. We enthusiasts knew and appreciated it existed. Unfortunately the public at large didn't and GM's lack of advertising is largely to blame. It's one of the reasons why less than 13,000 were made over the model's three year run.

Subaru's Ascent is another example. Sit back and think, I mean, really think; when was the last time you saw or even thought about the Ascent? Subaru's American-made, seven-seat crossover replaced the Tribeca and has been on sale since 2019. Yet among heavy hitter competitors like the Kia Telluride, Hyundai Palisade and Toyota Grand Highlander, it's probably not cross shopped as often as Subaru would like. This shows up in sales too. Ascent sales were down seven percent in 2024 with just over 56,000 sold. In January 2025, Ascent sales were down 16.3 percent compared to the same time in 2024. Even if you go shopping for one you might not find the spec you want. I searched for an Ascent using Subaru's inventory tool and within 200 miles, it's the second lowest Subaru model in stock after the Solterra EV.
Subaru's Impreza is another forgettable car. Long split from its WRX sibling, the Impreza now only exists to do battle against other cheap compacts like the Toyota Corolla and Honda Civic. Don't get me wrong. None of this is to say that the Impreza is bad. It was revamped for 2024 and looks to be an affordable option for someone who doesn't just want to drive another Corolla or Civic, but it's another one of those cars that probably isn't cross shopped against its competition and gets largely forgotten. Like the Ascent, the Impreza's sales reflect this. Subaru sold just 31,366 Impreza's in 2024; Honda sold just over 200,000 Civics during the same timeframe.
Now we ask you, Jalopnik reader. What car comes to mind when you think of something that's forgettable? It can be forgettable for any reason. Just let us know in the comments."
54,2025-02-21,"Samsung is keeping up its launch promos for the Galaxy S25 series, but some of the best color options are currently out of stock or heavily delayed.
The color options for this year’s Galaxy S25 series are a bit underwhelming (and bizarrely named), but there are a few standouts. The “Navy” and “Coralred” colors for the base Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25+ are stunning in person, while “Titanium Black” and “Titanium Jadegreen” for the Galaxy S25 Ultra have some good contrast between the frame and backplate. 
Currently, though, many of those devices are out of stock or unavailable for shipping to buyers.
The base Galaxy S25 is sold out of its Coralred and Pinkgold variants entirely, while Navy, Mint, and Icy Blue are all unavailable for shipping. That’s for the effectively-free 256GB model anyway, with all options still available with 128GB of storage. Galaxy S25+ is in a similar boat, with Navy and Silver Shadow not available for shipping, and Coralred delayed to the first week of March.
It’s the Galaxy S25 Ultra that’s been hit hardest here. For the 512GB variant, which sells for the same $1,299 as the 256GB model thanks to Samsung’s ongoing upgrade credit, the Titanium Jadegreen, Titanium Silverblue, and Titanium Pinkgold options are completely out of stock. Titanium Black is also not available for shipping, and most of these variants are also out of stock for the 1TB model. The base 256GB option, though, is fully in stock in all colors.
This comes while Samsung is still offering its launch promos for the Galaxy S25 series with credits that can be applied towards storage upgrades or accessories, and extremely high trade-in values in many cases.

55,2025-02-21," The announcement comes as Walmart, long hailed as a bastion of affordability in a multi-year inflation storm, faces mounting challenges from rising costs, potential tariffs, and a fragile consumer base. Despite its pricing power and ability to attract wealthier shoppers, the retail giantâs warning highlights the precarious state of the U.S. economy and the growing risks for businesses navigating an increasingly volatile landscape.Key takeaways from Walmartâs earnings report â¢ Fourth-Quarter Wins: Walmart exceeded expectations in the fourth quarter of 2024, with 180.6 billion in revenue, 7.9 billion in operating income, and a 20% jump in e-commerce sales. â¢ Dismal Forecast: Despite exceeding expectations in the fourth quarter, full-year adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are projected at 2.50 to 2.60, below the 2.77 consensus estimate. First?quarter EPS is expected at 2.77 missing the 0.65 forecast. â¢ Market Reaction: Shares plunged nearly 8% in premarket trading, threatening to erase a 77% rally over the past year. â¢ Tariff Concerns: Walmartâs CFO, John David Rainey, warned that the guidance does not account for potential tariffs from President Trumpâs escalating trade war. The cost of tariffs could ultimately be passed on to consumers, as cheap Chinese goods became more expensive at places like WalMart.The inflation storm and Walmartâs pricing power Walmart has long been a lifeline for budget-conscious consumers, offering low prices amid a relentless inflation storm that has squeezed household budgets for years. The retailerâs ability to maintain its pricing power has allowed it to outperform competitors, even as wealthier consumers increasingly turn to its stores for value. However, the companyâs latest earnings guidance reveals cracks in its armor. While Walmartâs e-commerce growth and holiday sales were strong, its product mixâweighted heavily toward lower-margin groceriesâhas put pressure on profitability. CEO Doug McMillon acknowledged the challenges in a statement, saying, âWe have momentum driven by our low prices, a growing assortment, and an e-commerce business driven by faster delivery times. Weâre gaining market share, our top line is healthy, and weâre in great shape with inventory.â Yet, the question remains: Can Walmart continue to offer the best prices if tariffs on Chinese imports and Mexican food products drive costs higher? Rainey hinted at the companyâs strategy, telling Bloomberg, âWeâll work with suppliers. Weâll lean into our private brands to keep prices low.âThe looming threat of tariffs and trade wars Walmartâs reliance on imported goods makes it particularly vulnerable to the escalating trade tensions under President Trumpâs administration. The company imports a significant portion of its merchandise from China and food products from Mexico, leaving it exposed to potential tariff hikes. Raineyâs admission that the current guidance does not include the impact of tariffs has spooked investors, who fear that rising costs could force Walmart to pass expenses onto consumers. This would undermine its reputation as the go-to destination for affordable goods and could erode its competitive edge. The uncertainty surrounding trade policy adds another layer of complexity to an already fragile economic environment. As Rainey noted, âI would describe the consumer as steady,â but spending is far from a complete rebound. This cautious outlook reflects the broader challenges facing retailers as they navigate a landscape marked by inflation, shifting consumer behavior, and geopolitical risks. Walmartâs earnings warning is more than just a corporate misstepâitâs a harbinger of deeper economic troubles. The retail giantâs struggles highlight the fragility of consumer spending, which has been propped up by debt and dwindling savings. With inflation still elevated and interest rates remaining high, households are increasingly forced to make tough choices about where to allocate their dollars. The companyâs reliance on low-margin groceries further underscores the precarious state of the retail sector. As consumers prioritize essentials over discretionary spending, retailers like Walmart face mounting pressure to maintain profitability while keeping prices low. Sources include:  Zerohedge.com  Zerohedge.com  Zerohedge.com

56,2025-02-21,The Ron DeSantis appointee said the retailer's policies crashed its stock price and hurt Florida's pension fund.
57,2025-02-21,"Since the launch of the M-series processors and now the C1 cellular modem, Apple has been slowly but surely moving toward complete chip independence. The company is even working on its own Bluetooth and Wi-Fi solution, which is reportedly coming with new Home products and the iPhone 17 lineup in the Fall.
One obvious benefit of developing chips in-house is energy efficiency. Apple toated this with the introduction of Apple Silicon what feels like a hundred years ago, and this week with its first-ever 5G modem, which gives the iPhone 16e nearly 20% better battery life over the flagship iPhone 16. While improved battery life is certainly appealing, there are less obvious but more significant benefits of Apple having end-to-end control over both the software and hardware components.

Apple has learned some lessons from past vulnerabilities on third-party chips. In 2017, Nitay Artenstein discovered what was known as the Broadpwn flaw—a memory corruption bug in Broadcom’s Wi-Fi chipset firmware that could allow an attacker to execute code remotely within a certain radius. Over a billion Wi-Fi-capable devices and access points, including iPhone 7 and previous generations, were affected. It was not long until 2020 when another vulnerability was discovered on a Broadcom Wi-Fi chipset that left devices exposed to eavesdropping. And that’s just Wi-Fi chips…
The scary part is always how long the vulnerability existed before it was discovered—hopefully by the good guys—and how long it takes to push out a patch afterward. Nobody has control over the former, but in both cases above, it took months between the flaws being reported and patches released. Apple-made components aren’t perfect either, but because the in-house hardware and software teams are already closely integrated, it should, in theory, allow for faster response times without waiting on third-party companies. Apple would just need to queue up a Rapid Security Response, and boom, it’s automatically patched on billions of devices overnight.
A second key benefit lies in the supply chain. Supply chain attacks—where hackers target vendors or suppliers with access to a company’s hardware, software, or network—have surged in recent years.
On April 20, 2021, while Apple was holding its ‘Spring Loaded’ event, it was also facing a situation behind the scenes. The group behind the REvil ransomware claimed to have breached Quanta Computer, a key Apple contractor in Taiwan, obtaining schematics believed to be for upcoming unreleased products, including MacBook designs. Even firms like Apple are only as strong as its weakest link.
It doesn’t matter how good your corporate security posture is if a supplier is breached. For Apple, which relies on a global network of chip manufacturers and component suppliers (like Broadcom, Qualcomm, etc), this is a significant security concern. By developing its own chips, the company can minimize its exposure, decreasing the likelihood of threats.
Of course, this is my security outlook on the firm’s transition to developing more components in-house. I think this is a significant win for consumers, but I’d love to hear what others think! Leave a comment below.

58,2025-02-21,"NVIDIA's new 50-series ""Blackwell"" cards lack 32-bit PhysX support. Does it really matter? Here's what you need to know.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

NVIDIA dropping 32-bit PhysX support in its new RTX 50-series GPUs is a hot topic in some corners of the internet, and I'm seeing lots of people pile on to express their dismay at the company's decision to abandon a piece of what makes PC gaming so attractive: backward compatibility.
I don't disagree. The move by NVIDIA, taken at face value, seems like a slight to those who spent huge on the new hardware only to find that it's missing a piece that's prevalent in NVIDIA RTX 40-series (and older) GPUs.
It seems like NVIDIA came out of nowhere with the decision, and indeed it wasn't exactly expressed in a major way. An NVIDIA support thread last updated on January 17, 2025, seems to be the official announcement, and it's been quoted to reply to users providing negative feedback regarding 32-bit PhysX support on the NVIDIA forums.
I'm not a fan of how NVIDIA handled the situation, but ultimately, it's not as big of a deal as some are making it out to be.

PhysX has a long history. It's a technology that's changed hands a few times due to acquisitions; it was originally named NovodeX before being acquired by Ageia in 2004, which was then acquired by NVIDIA in 2008.
It began as a technology made to run on Physics Processing Units (PPU), but NVIDIA changed it to run instead on its GPUs following the acquisition.
PhysX's main goal is to simulate physics, including body and cloth dynamics, ragdoll effects, particles, and more. To operate properly, it employs NVIDIA's 32-bit CUDA cores.

NVIDIA's RTX 50-series ""Blackwell"" GPUs lack 32-bit CUDA support, which is the main issue with 32-bit PhysX support. Aging technologies are quietly retired all the time, and if NVIDIA's RTX 5000 launch had gone smoother, I suspect many wouldn't have made as big of a deal out of the news.
Let's say you got lucky and landed an RTX 50-series GPU before scalpers could get ahold of all the stock. You launch a game that utilizes 32-bit PhysX. Will it run? Absolutely. A lack of 32-bit PhysX support doesn't mean your RTX 50-series GPU won't run the game.
A lack of 32-bit PhysX support doesn't mean your RTX 50-series GPU won't run the game.
Popular games like Borderlands 2 and Batman: Arkham City notably use 32-bit PhysX, and you will absolutely have to disable the feature in the games if you'd rather not see performance fall off.
When a GPU is incapable of running PhysX, it turns to the CPU. Unfortunately, the CPU isn't meant to handle the task, and performance tanks. This is evident in a short video posted by Reddit user PaP3s in which they play Borderlands 2 on an RTX 5080 and a GTX 980 Ti. You can guess which card offers better performance (hint: it's the older one).
👉 Read our NVIDIA RTX 5090 Founders Edition review
The good news? You can disable PhysX features in the game and have it run smoothly on an NVIDIA RTX 50-series GPU. Your game won't exactly look and feel the same, but at least it's not completely incompatible.
A member of the ResetEra forums recently created a brilliant post detailing all of the games that are affected by NVIDIA's decision to abandon 32-bit PhysX support in its RTX 50-series GPUs.
There are, in total, 43 games identified as having 32-bit PhysX GPU acceleration.
I bolded some of the games that I feel like many people still play, myself included. The Witcher 3, thankfully, came with PhysX support designed to run on a CPU instead, so you can still enjoy the PhysX features even if you have an RTX 50-series or AMD GPU.
To reiterate, the games listed above are not unplayable on a ""Blackwell"" GPU. You just won't be able to enable PhysX and expect good performance.

AMD Radeon GPU users have been experiencing a lack of PhysX support for years, which leads me to my next point.
Major changes to NVIDIA's CUDA cores in the ""Blackwell"" era mean it won't reverse its decision (I doubt that's even possible), so you'll have to take matters into your own hands.
If you really want to keep PhysX around, you can always buy an old (and presumably cheap) NVIDIA GPU and have it run alongside your main RTX 50-series card. It's not an ideal setup, but it's probably the best avenue for those who can't live without certain games with PhysX enabled.
I'm sticking to the opinion that if NVIDIA's RTX 5000 launch hadn't been plagued with poor stock availability, inflated prices, melting power cables, and faulty drivers, the removal of 32-bit PhysX support wouldn't have been nearly as big of a deal.
Instead, it's another blow to Team Green faithful, who already feel slighted. I totally understand the sentiment, but old tech can't stick around forever.
Let me know what you think about NVIDIA's decision and whether or not it affects you!

61,2025-02-21,"Major cryptocurrency exchange Bybit said all of its liquidation data is now publicly available through an upgrade to its application programming interface (API).
With the upgrade, the API delivers liquidation data updates every 500 milliseconds, twice as fast as the previous version, which provided just one update per second per trading pair, it said.
The change ensures that every liquidation event is captured in real time, eliminating blind spots that previously obscured the true scope of market activity
“The real spirit of crypto is transparency. By making all liquidation data fully public, we’re empowering traders and analysts with the insights they need,” CEO and co-founder Ben Zhou said in a statement.
Liquidation data helps traders identify market trends, support and resistance levels, and potential volatility spikes. Examining the data will provide traders, analysts, and institutional investors with real-time insights into market activity.
Earlier this month, significant volatility led to over $2.2 billion in liquidations being reported in just 24 hours. At the time, Zhou said that the “real total liquidation is a lot more than $2B, by my estimation it should be at least $8-10B.”
He revealed that on Bybit alone, liquidations hit $2.1 billion in the previous 24 hours. API limitations, he said, were to blame for the lack of proper data on these events.

62,2025-02-21,"Unbaked cookie dough isnât considered edible because it usually contains raw eggs and flourâbut that doesnât stop people from eating it. Fortunately companies like NestlÃ© Toll House now sell edible cookie dough, and you can even make your own safe-to-eat cookie dough at home. If youâre looking for a version of the treat that goes beyond the classic chocolate chip, you may be interested in the new Extra Flaminâ Hot Cookie Dough & Gelato Bites from Doughlicious.
Nerdist reports that the snack company Doughlicious partnered with PepsiCo to create the unusual flavor combination. Their new product is not for the faint of heart (or stomach): It consists of birdâs eye chili cookie dough, ghost pepper-infused gelato, and a chipotle cookie crumb coating. The unusual blend of sweet and savory is unlike anything else you might find in the frozen treats aisle. Even if you enjoy other Flaminâ Hot foods, like this grilled cheese sandwich made with Velveeta and Flaminâ Hot Cheetos, this particular concoction may be hard to stomach. Â Â 
Boxes of the cookie dough bites are selling for Â£4 (about $5) on Ocado. The Doughlicious brand is also sold at major retailers, such as Target and Whole Foods Market, though itâs unclear if their latest product will be sold in the stores. Until then, you can visit the brandâs website to stay up to date on their offerings. If you prefer more conventional cookie dough flavors, you may be interested in their mint chocolate chip or strawberry varieties.
Extra Flaminâ Hot Cookie Dough & Gelato Bites are hardly the first product to combine cheesy junk food with ice cream. In October 2024, Doritos opened its first-ever restaurant at the Crypto.com Arena, which served a âcrunchtasticâ vanilla ice cream cone covered in crushed nacho cheese Dorito crumbs.Â Â

Cryptocurrency prices are rising after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s former crypto enforcement unit transitioned into the Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit and amid dovish comments from Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic.
Renaming the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit is significant because it shows the agency is moving away from its crypto focus that often led to accusations of regulation by enforcement and legal battles with major industry participants.
“In the near to medium term, clearer regulations will likely boost institutional participation, leading to improvements in market infrastructure,” BackPack founder and CEO Armani Ferrante told CoinDesk. Bitcoin is now above $98,000 after adding 1.2% in 24 hours, while the broader CoinDesk 20 Index rose 1.35%.
Yet, volatility is still relatively low. ""These environments may feel slow and frustrating, but they rarely persist for long — volatility tends to mean revert,” Wintermute OTC trader Jake O told CoinDesk.
With tensions between the U.S. and its European allies growing, investors are hoping Germany's election on Sunday will lead to a stable coalition government that will push out economic reforms to stimulate growth and boost defense spending. Germany is Europe’s largest economy and a positive result could lead to a more risk-on approach.
Open interest has already moved up ahead of the election. Still, the crypto market  lacks positive catalysts in the near term, JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a report.
In fact, the market is nearing backwardation — where spot prices rise above futures prices — in a “negative development” that’s “indicative of demand weakness” by institutional investors using regulated CME futures contracts to gain exposure to the market. Stay alert!

The cryptocurrency market is lacking positive catalysts in the near term, Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM) said in a report Wednesday.
The correction in crypto markets in recent months has seen both bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH) futures near backwardation, which is a sign of lower demand, the report said. Backwardation occurs when the spot price of an asset is higher than the price trading in the futures market.
""This is a negative development and indicative of demand weakness by those institutional investors that use regulated CME futures contracts to gain exposure into these two cryptocurrencies,"" analysts led Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote.
If demand for bitcoin and ether futures is healthy, the futures cost more than the spot price, and the curve is said to be in contango, the bank noted.
When demand slows and price expectations soften, the futures curve moves towards backwardation, the bank added. 
This weakness in demand could be due to a number of reasons. 
Positive crypto initiatives by Trump's new administration are more likely to kick in during the second half of the year, the bank said, and this means institutional investors are likely taking profits due to a lack of short-term catalysts.
Lower demand from systematic and momentum-driven funds, such as CTAs, has also affected bitcoin and ether futures, JPMorgan added.

Apple just dropped visionOS 2.4 Beta, packing powerful new tools, a new guest experience, a fresh Spatial Gallery app, and the debut of Apple Intelligence on Vision Pro. Apple is kicking off 2025 with a bang, unveiling the visionOS 2.4 Beta packed with exciting features that set the stage for the upcoming public release in April.The company is finally bringing its suite of generative artificial intelligence tools with Apple Intelligence. The update brings Image Playground, allowing users to create playful images, Genmoji for crafting custom emojis, and Writing Tools, which is poised to become a favorite for content creators. Apple Intelligence aims to compete with other generative AI tools in the market, offering creative flexibility directly within the Apple ecosystem.Guest User feature makes sharing easyApple is also making it easier to share your Vision Pro with others through the new Guest User feature. When you hand over your device, a prompt pops up on your nearby iPhone or iPad with an 'Allow Guest User' option.From there, you can select which apps the guest can access, initiate View Mirroring via AirPlay, and guide them through the experience. It's a practical solution for families, friends, or even educational settings where sharing the Vision Pro is beneficial.Previously, sharing a Vision Pro was slightly more arduous, and there wasn't a screen-sharing feature. The new Guest User feature recreates Apple's in-store demo experience, offering a controlled, customizable interface for guests without affecting the owner's primary setup.It's still not multiple user support, but it's closer.It's a practical solution for families, friends, or even educational settings where sharing the Vision Pro is beneficial.New Spatial Gallery app showcases immersive contentThe new Spatial Gallery app is another addition. Apple is curating a breathtaking collection of spatial photos, videos, and panoramas from top-tier artists, filmmakers, and brands like Cirque du Soleil and Porsche.For example, users might immerse themselves in a live Cirque du Soleil performance or explore a 360-degree Porsche design showcase. It's a smart move by Apple that helps users understand the capabilities of the Apple Vision Pro and its capability for immersive experiences.The Spatial Gallery app doesn't appear to be on the Apple Vision Pro app, according to AppleInsider staff. Currently it's unknown if Apple is saving it for the official visionOS 2.4 release or will include it later in a beta update.Control Vision Pro from your iPhoneAlongside the visionOS update, Apple is launching a new Vision Pro app for iPhone. The app allows users to browse and queue up apps or games for download, discover spatial content from Apple TV and Spatial Gallery, and access useful tips, without needing to wear the headset.The app will arrive with iOS 18.4 in all regions where Vision Pro is available, and it's set to make managing the device more convenient.In all, the visionOS 2.4 Beta introduces nice enhancements that refine the Vision Pro experience and expand its utility.

I’ve had the Vision Pro since it first shipped last year.  A big frustration has been the awkwardness of demonstrating to a friend.  While you can share their image on an iPad or TV, it all goes black as soon as you go to AppleTV and try to show immersive content due to copyright restrictions.  Ridiculous.hopefully the new share will be easier.jim

I absolutely despise when products shit a demo mode on their interface after I've already bought them. I'm a customer, not a salesman. Something that could grow out of this guest mode is great for my eventual primary usage: studio use with copious virtual real estate, several monitors for tracking, mixer, analysers, synched video track, as well as plugin interfaces placed virtually among the hardware in the studio. Having a second set of vision Pro to hand to a customer and being in the same space for would be great.

I need to try out the Vision Pro.  I have always assumed that requiring reading glasses would make it a PITA; I know they offer lenses, but I am just dubious about how well that would work.  I have 20/20 over two feet and need correction for less than two feet; even 1.5 magnifiers work for me. I don't even need a prescription. Has anyone in a similar position tried the VP?

You can test drive the AVP at an Apple Store including the lenses that will match your needs so you can see for yourself.  My experience was that they worked very well.  My eyes are significantly different from each other, so I ended up ordering my AVP with the custom Zeiss lenses, although to be honest, the normal 1.5 lenses would have worked just as well.  Once you get your lenses, they install magnetically, so they just stay in place…no hassle at all.  Definitely give it serious look…it’s a transformative product.

Executives at Meta stand to get bigger bonuses this year. 
The company said in a corporate filing Thursday that it had approved “an increase in the target bonus percentage” for its annual bonus plan for executives. Meta’s named executive officers could earn a bonus of 200% of their base salary under the new plan, up from the 75% they earned previously, according to the filing. 
The updated bonus plan doesn’t apply to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the filing noted.
A committee for Meta’s board of directors approved the change on Feb.13 after determining that the “target total cash compensation” for its executives “was at or below the 15th percentile of the target total cash compensation of executives holding similar positions” at peer companies. 
“Following this increase, the target total cash compensation for the named executive officers (other than the CEO) falls at approximately the 50th percentile of the Peer Group Target Cash Compensation,” the filing said.
The disclosure of the new executive bonus plan comes a week after Meta began laying off 5% of its overall workforce. The company had previously said this would impact its lowest performers.
Meta also slashed its annual distribution of stock options by about 10% for thousands of employees, according to a report published Thursday by the Financial Times. The report noted that the stock option reduction may differ based on where the workers live and their position at the company.
Meta shares are up more than 47% over the past year and closed Thursday at $694.84, underscoring investor enthusiasm over the social media company’s growing sales in the digital advertising market and the potential for its artificial intelligence investments to eventually generate big returns.
The company said in January that its fourth-quarter revenue grew 21% year over year to $48.39 billion.
Meta did not reply to a request for comment.

74,2025-02-21,"Good work, Britain. Owners of Apple devices in the United Kingdom will be a little less safe moving forward as the company pulls its most secure end-to-end (E2E) encryption from the country. The move is in response to government demands there that Apple build a backdoor into its iCloud encryption feature that would allow law enforcement to access the cloud data of any iPhone user around the world under the guise of national security.
Apple has for many years marketed its products as being the most safe and secure personal electronics available on the market. Being a key pillar of the brand, Apple has consistently pushed back against government orders around the world to decrypt confiscated devices or build similar backdoors into its products. China requires data be stored domestically but the system of encryption is still present there.
The most famous instance of Appleâs non-compliance was when, under President Trump’s first administration, it refused Department of Justice demands to unlock an iPhone used by the attacker in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California. The FBI eventually paid a third-party Australian firm a reported $900,000 to identify an “exploit chain” and crack open the device.
Following Appleâs decision to pull E2E cloud encryption from the UK, the company on Friday told Bloomberg that âenhancing the security of cloud storage with end-to-end encryption is more urgent than ever beforeâ and that it âremains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom.â
The UK order asked Apple for access to global user data under the country’s Investigatory Powers Act, a law that grants officials the authority to compel companies to remove encryption under a “technical capability notice.” Gizmodo has reached out to the UK government.
good on Apple for pulling encryption from the UK rather than compromising it's security.
it's unfortunate for UK users, but that's on their government for insisting on weaker security pic.twitter.com/hOzfwcydlG

“Security officials asked not only that Apple allow the UK government access to UK residentsâ encrypted cloud storage, but that the UK government get access to any Apple userâs encrypted cloud storage,” said David Ruiz, an online privacy expert at Malwarebytes. “To demand access to the worldâs data is such a brazen, imperialist maneuver that Iâm surprised it hasnât come from, well, honestly, the US. This may embolden other countries, particularly those in the ‘Five Eyes,’ to make a similar demand of Apple.” Ruiz questioned what this means for the UK’s privacy guarantees with the US. 
Law enforcement is always looking for new ways to conduct surveillance under the guise of protecting the publicâEdward Snowden famously revealed a dragnet of surveillance created after 9/11 that pulled in data on individuals domestic and abroa. But once the genie is taken out of the proverbial bottle, it is hard to put it back, and the capabilities can end up in the wrong hands. Police already have access to plenty investigative powers, privacy advocates say, and the public should be very cautious about giving them more that could be ripe for abuse.
Building a backdoor into any encryption product defeats the purpose, essentially rendering the security moot. If there is a backdoor, Apple and privacy advocates have long argued, then bad actors and authoritarian states will be able to find and exploit those backdoors or demand Apple provide access. The entire purpose of end-to-end encryption is that nobody, not even Apple, can access a user’s sensitive data. Backdoors are an inherent vulnerability.
End-to-end encryption of iCloud, formally called Advanced Device Protection, covers data storage, device backups, web bookmarks, voice memos, notes, photos, reminders, and text message backups. The way ADP works, data is stored in the cloud but can only be decrypted locally on a user’s device, using a key stored in the Secure Enclave security component built physically into Apple devices. Bloomberg reports that Apple will not remove end-to-end encryption for other features including iMessage, FaceTime, password management, and health data. So all of that is safe for now.
With today’s move, Apple is essentially saying that it would rather pull the E2E encryption altogether and inform customers they will be less safe, rather than build an open door for the UK government. It is a shrewd, gigachad move by Apple even though consumers there will no longer have the same amount of security as others around the globe. iCloud encryption is important as the service has in the past been a target of hackers who penetrated the accounts of celebrities to steal their nudes and post them online in a scandal that was called “the Fappening.”
Of course, because no security is entirely bulletproof, hackers and law enforcement groups still manage to find ways to penetrate iPhones, and doing so is a billion-dollar business for companies like Israel’s NSO Group, which supplies iPhone cracking software to governments around the world. It is essentially playing a cat-and-mouse game with Appleâeach time hackers find an exploit, they are able to take advantage of it for a limited time before Apple plugs the hole. ADP was intended as a way to make it tougher for nefarious actors to access certain data, though it makes it more difficult for users to recover their content if they lose their devices.
NSO Group and other firms claim they only sell their exploits to governments and law enforcement and prohibit the software from being used to spy on dissidents or journalists. But reporting over the years has put those claims in significant doubt, as NSO’s software has been linked to hacks of journalists around the globe, including Jamal Khashoggi, whose devices were monitored leading up to his brutal assassination by Saudi intelligence agents.Â   Those who live in the UK will need to manually disable ADP during an unspecified grace period to keep their iCloud account. Bloomberg says that Apple will release feature guidance on this process sometime soon.

75,2025-02-21,"Bill Gates says 2 AM sneaking to code at 13 and leaving Harvard to run Microsoft as CEO heavily contributed to its $3 trillion success.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Microsoft is arguably the most valuable company in the world, with a market capitalization of over $3 trillion. Its products and services have been broadly adopted worldwide and are essential to the success of most organizations.
Last year's CrowdStrike global IT outage caused by a faulty rapid response content update crippled operations across a wide range of business after leaving approximately 8.5 million Windows devices with dreadful a Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) error.
While competition has stiffened over the years, prompting the Redmond giant to trade places with NVIDIA and Apple for the top spot due to their heavy investment in the AI bubble, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates recently shared the early key ingredients contributing to the tech giant's success.
As highlighted in the co-founder's new memoir, Source Code: My Beginnings, the philanthropic billionaire revealed that he began sneaking out at the wee hours of the night at the tender age of 13 to code because his house didn't have a computer.
He'd take a 20-minute ride downtown to access a computer, where he'd often practice and perfect his coding skills, only to return home at 2 a.m. Gates indicated that he greatly benefited from ""laissez-faire treatment,"" as passers-by were seemingly unphased by his presence in town in the dead of night.
Bill Gates attributed his early interactions with a computer to a local company in Seattle called Computer Center. He had unlimited computer access, where he'd spend hours perfecting his coding skills. However, he was required to help the company with bugs and malware issues.
We were kids… none of us had any real computer experience,” Gates wrote. “Without that lucky break of free computer time—call it my first 500 hours—the next 9,500 hours might not have happened at all.

Bill Gates revealed he was forced to ditch Harvard University barely three semesters after joining the prestigious learning institution. “I had to give in to the inevitable and give up school and, of course, never go back,” Gates indicated while speaking to CNBC.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
Gates revealed his departure from Harvard was prompted when his longtime buddy and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen ran to his room with a copy of Popular Electronics magazine, which featured the “world’s first minicomputer kit to rival commercial models” on the cover.
The Altair 8800, developed by Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), prompted a lightbulb moment for the quo, consequently leading to Microsoft's debut.
While speaking to CNBC, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates indicated:
“Until then, we felt like, ‘Hey, this is going to happen and we’ll figure out our timing and what kind of company to do. The panic about, ‘God, it’s happening without us,’ was when Popular Electronics had the kit computer [on its cover]. Little did we know, [MITS] basically hadn’t assembled any of them.”
Bill Gates seemingly enjoyed his short time at the Ivy League learning institution, but in hindsight, he admits he'd have fumbled his opportunity with Microsoft.

76,2025-02-21,"Physical media is in its comeback era.Â 
From rising vinyl sales to eBay bidding wars over Blu-ray releases of Oscar-winning epics (weâre looking at you, Oppenheimer) pop culture fans are migrating away from the cloud, preferring instead to build up their entertainment libraries in real life. That trend towards the tangible extends to the nostalgic art that once covered the walls of many a Millennialâs teenage bedroom.Â If youâre a fan of movie posters, you may be interested in these rare collectorâs items hitting the auction block on March 7 and 8th.
Film posters can be works of artâillustrations that summarize a filmâs greatest strengths or translate an auteur directorâs vision. Fans who fall in love with a franchise or a particular filmmakerâs style may collect them as a keepsake, a reminder of a moviegoing memory, or a decorative gem they can show off to friends. And sure, Marvel team-ups packed with A-list superheroes are fun, but those posters arenât what most collectors are after. Theyâre much more interested in the hand-painted, intricately-designed artwork that emerged from the Golden Age of Hollywood.Â 
Next month, Propstore is hosting a collectible posters auction that features an eclectic lineup of some of the most sought-after movie posters from the past century. From a psychedelic homage to Stanley Kubrickâs genre-defining A Clockwork Orange (1972) to a visually-striking copy of 1931âs Frankensteinâany early film in Universalâs monster canonâthereâs something for every kind of cinephile.Â 
Propstoreâs U.S. director of posters Grey Smith described the items as more than just collectibles. In a press release, he stated that âeach piece tells a storyâ and represents âthe enduring legacy of classic filmmaking.â Because these pieces of art are so hard to find, they come with a hefty price tag. While the Frankenstein one sheet is estimated to sell for up to $250,000 (only seven or eight copies are known to exist, after all), posters for 1933âs King Kong, 1941âs Superman, and A Clockwork Orange clock in at a âreasonableâ $15,000 to $40,000. If youâre open to relatively recent fare, a 1985 print advertising Back to the Future is estimated to sell for just $600.
Whatever your price point, thereâs a sense of undeniable joy in owning a bit of film historyâespecially when it comes to physical posters, which can feel like a dying art in an age when trailers and social media campaigns are how many studios prefer to market their films. To take part in the live, online auction the second weekend of March, you can register to bid here.

Although it’s still a small segment, gaming smartphones had quite an impact on the smartphone segment for two particular reasons. One is, of course, the over-the-top performance sometimes coupled with equally over-the-top cooling solutions. Then there are the distinct design cues chosen to appeal to gamer aesthetics, often with dark color schemes highlighted with some neon RGB lighting. It’s a visual that many gamers will be familiar with but not all subscribe to.
As powerful as gaming smartphones might be, not everyone will find their appearance appealing, especially those who might want to be able to bring out their mobile partner in more formal settings. These people will absolutely adore this limited edition of one of the most powerful gaming smartphones on the market, exuding an aura of elegance and luxury that belies the gaming-worthy power it holds inside. Even better, the very things that make this handsome RedMagic 10 Pro look so good are also the things that make it so cool, literally.
Designer: RedMagic







You’ve probably heard about how copper and aluminum are often used in cooling systems for phones and computers, but these aren’t the only metals that are good for thermal management. They just happen to be the most accessible and most affordable, which is what you need for mass-produced items. But if you’re doing a limited run anyway, might as well go for the gold, right?

The RedMagic 10 Pro Golden Saga Limited Edition spares no expense in the name of pushing the limits of performance, even more than your run-of-the-mill gaming smartphone. It uses premium materials like gold-plated VC fins and silver alloy air duct and cover for ultimate heat dissipation and thermal conducting, respectively. It enhances these capabilities with carbon fiber, a material used in luxury sports cars and known for its lightweight properties and exceptional thermal efficiency.








That premium character is reflected on the outside as well, with a dark black motif broken by golden accents on the power button and around the fan frame. The textured carbon fiber appearance of the rear panel gives the phone a slightly rugged yet still stylish aesthetic. It’s definitely a look that will earn you a lot of attention, whether you’re in an office meeting, a gala, or an e-sports meetup.


The VIP treatment continues with the Saga Gift Box packaging, which includes a matching Cooler 5 Pro accessory, a themed phone case, a gold-plated SIM ejector, and a card with a unique number that marks you as one of the privileged few to get their hands on one of these beauties. Unsurprisingly, the RedMagic 10 Pro Golden Saga Limited Edition fetches a steep price tag of $1,499, a hefty $500 more than the equivalent “normal” 12GB/1TB model. Of course, with its excellent performance and the limited run of this luxurious model, it’s quite possibly worth its weight in gold.

Tiny homes are revolutionizing the housing market, offering an innovative solution to affordability, sustainability, and minimalism. Construction companies have a unique opportunity to tap into this growing demand, whether by expanding existing services or entering the market for the first time. Success in this niche requires a strategic approach that integrates smart design, efficiency, and targeted marketing.
This article explores key strategies for construction companies looking to thrive in the tiny home industry, from understanding market demand to optimizing design and expanding outreach.
The demand for tiny homes has surged in recent years, driven by economic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Rising housing costs make traditional homeownership unattainable for many while downsizing appeals to those seeking financial freedom and lower living expenses. Sustainability also plays a key role, with eco-conscious buyers looking for energy-efficient and environmentally friendly housing solutions.
Demographic shifts further fuel this trend. Young professionals eager to avoid high rents and retirees looking to simplify their lives find tiny homes an attractive alternative. Additionally, rising urbanization and a shift toward remote work have allowed many people to consider non-traditional living arrangements that prioritize financial and lifestyle flexibility.
Building tiny homes presents both opportunities and challenges. Lower material costs, faster construction timelines, and high demand make them attractive. Additionally, eco-friendly materials and energy-efficient designs enhance their appeal, aligning with the growing preference for sustainability.
However, companies must navigate zoning restrictions, financing hurdles, and the challenge of designing functional yet compact spaces. Builders adopting modular construction and innovative storage solutions can overcome these obstacles while keeping construction efficient and cost-effective. Many firms are already addressing these challenges by incorporating sustainable building practices in tiny home construction, such as passive solar heating, reclaimed materials, and water-saving fixtures.
Tiny homes also present an opportunity for companies to develop off-grid solutions. Features like solar energy, rainwater collection, and composting toilets can attract buyers looking for self-sufficient and environmentally responsible living options. For builders, investing in research and development for innovative off-grid solutions can create a competitive advantage in the industry. For a deeper look into the benefits and challenges of tiny home construction, builders should assess their capabilities and market positioning before fully committing to this sector.
Tiny home construction requires a balance of innovation, efficiency, and sustainability. Builders must optimize small spaces while maintaining comfort and functionality. Eco-friendly materials and energy-efficient technologies enhance appeal, while flexible designs ensure adaptability for various lifestyles.
Let’s explore key strategies that help builders refine their approach.
One of the biggest challenges in tiny home construction is ensuring the design accommodates various needs. A well-planned layout should allow for modular or expandable options, allowing homeowners to customize their living space over time. Features like foldable furniture, convertible workspaces, and multi-functional storage solutions maximize efficiency and comfort.
Additionally, scalable production methods enable construction companies to standardize some aspects while offering personalization. This approach streamlines production, reduces costs, and shortens construction timelines, making tiny homes more accessible to a broader audience.
Incorporating smart home technology into tiny homes can also enhance their functionality. 
Automated lighting, energy monitoring systems, and app-controlled appliances can add convenience while ensuring efficient energy use. Integrating these advanced technologies allows builders to attract a tech-savvy market segment interested in modern, space-saving solutions.
The success of any project relies on the team, so every employee must not only be skilled but be dedicated to their company. To attract talented employees, companies must be creative during the recruitment process. Many follow construction recruitment trends, such as incentivizing potential employees by appealing to personal motivations, such as a short commute.
Efficiency in construction cuts costs and aligns with the sustainability movement that tiny home buyers value. Implementing precision cutting, prefabrication, and lean building techniques can significantly reduce material waste and improve efficiency.
Promotional partnerships can also contribute to waste reduction and sustainability efforts. Companies that embrace eco-friendly branding and collaborations can reach broader audiences and align with values that attract tiny home buyers. Promotional products like cards, branded pens, and more can be valuable in spreading awareness and reinforcing a company’s commitment to sustainability.
Additionally, investing in recycled and upcycled materials can create a competitive edge. Repurposing old shipping containers, reclaimed barn wood, and salvaged fixtures allows builders to create unique, cost-effective tiny homes that appeal to buyers who appreciate sustainability and character.
A well-thought-out design and construction approach ultimately leads to satisfied customers and a strong reputation in the tiny home market. Combining energy efficiency, adaptable layouts, and waste reduction strategies ensures long-term success in this evolving industry.
Capturing market attention and expanding a tiny home business requires a strategic approach to marketing and partnerships. Potential buyers want to see the quality and functionality of a tiny home before making a purchase, making visual representation essential. Virtual tours, trade shows, and social media campaigns effectively showcase craftsmanship and attract interested buyers.
Establishing partnerships with land developers, interior designers, and sustainability advocates can further enhance brand visibility and credibility. These collaborations open doors to new customer bases while reinforcing a company’s expertise and commitment to sustainable living. Engaging with influencers in minimalism and eco-conscious communities can also drive awareness and create an organic following for tiny home offerings.
To strengthen brand authority, builders can also create educational content. Blog posts, case studies, and video walkthroughs of completed projects can establish trust with potential customers. Offering workshops or webinars on sustainable construction techniques and financing options can also position a company as an industry leader.

It's crucial for expansion to China.
Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida has admitted porting PlayStation-exclusive games to PC is ""almost like printing money"", and provides an opportunity to invest in further games.
In an interview with Sacred Symbols+ (via Push Square), Yoshida revealed he wanted to bring first-party games to PC sooner, but this wasn't Sony's business model at the time.
""Releasing on PC does many things: it reaches a new audience who do not own consoles – especially in regions where consoles are not as popular,"" he said. ""The idea is that those people may become fans of a particular franchise, and when a new game in that series comes out, they may be convinced to purchase a PlayStation.""
Beyond those benefits, it also allows Sony to reinvest money into other projects.
""It also adds additional income, because porting to PC is way cheaper than creating an original title,"" he said. ""So, it's almost like printing money. And that helps us to invest in new titles now that the cost of games has increased.""
What's more, releasing games on PC allows PlayStation to spread to new regions where that platform is more popular - China, in particular.
""China is a huge PC game market,"" said Yoshida. ""And China is a growing but very small console market. In order to reach the audience in countries like China then it's crucial to release on PC. So, I believe PC versions really reach a new audience.""
Beginning with Horizon Zero Dawn in 2020, Sony has gradually been porting its PlayStation exclusive games to PC.
Most recently, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 released on PC, while The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is set to follow in April.
And while these releases have seen diminishing returns in terms of player numbers on Steam at least, the release of Helldivers 2 was a huge success for Sony - it was PlayStation's fastest selling game owing to huge success on PC. That success was hampered, though, by Sony's insistence on requiring PSN to play.
In the same interview, Yoshida also discussed Sony's live service plans, revealing he played Naughty Dog's ill-fated The Last of Us Online, which he described as ""great"".

81,2025-02-21,"Another week, another alleged leak regarding Apple's fabled foldable iPhone. We've been hearing rumors about an iPhone that folds in half for over eight years now. While they have lacked consistency, they do suggest that Apple has tested various prototypes, with the hinge seemingly the biggest challenge Apple has been trying to overcome. Apple wants to eliminate any crease in the screen before bringing a device to market.
Today's ""exclusive"" information about Apple's foldable comes from Weibo-based leaker Digital Chat Station, and it concerns the screen measurements. According to the Chinese leaker, the device has a 5.49-inch outer screen that resembles the new Oppo Find N5, but is shorter and wider. Meanwhile, the inner screen is 7.74 inches and unfolds like an iPad. Apparently both displays have an ""unprecedented aspect ratio."" Apple's foldable phone will launch next year or the year after that, says the leaker, with a foldable iPad also expected to arrive within the same time frame.
Make of that what you will. The account has previously posted accurate information about the iPhone 12 mini's display, iPhone 15's upgraded sensor, and iPhone 16 Pro size increases. Digital Chat Station's launch timing for the device is also not too far off from other rumors we've heard. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Jeff Pu, The Information, and The Wall Street Journal have all suggested Apple is targeting a foldable iPhone launch in late 2026 or early 2027. We eagerly await its arrival so that this  perennial rumor can finally become a reality. For more information on the ever-shifting Apple foldable landscape, be sure to check our dedicated guide.

AI agents are reshaping industries, with some adopting them faster than others. The cryptocurrency sector is at the forefront, embracing automated decision-making, advanced data analysis, and greater efficiency in handling vast amounts of data. These AI technologies are becoming essential for traders, investors, and blockchain companies.
The AI agent market reached $5 billion in 2024 and is expected to grow to $47 billion by 2030. As Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, predicted during his presentation at CES 2025, ""AI agents are a multi-trillion-dollar opportunity."" One platform that facilitate the creation and deployment of AI agents, Olas, for instance, is already processing over 700,000 transactions monthly, with adoption rates climbing 30% month over month.
This growth is further accelerated by the emergence of DeFAI, a fusion of decentralized finance (DeFi) and AI agents, which is set to redefine the crypto landscape. Businesses and investors who adapt to these tools will gain an edge in a data-driven market.
DeFAI represents the integration of AI agents into DeFi platforms, automating and optimizing on-chain activities such as staking, swapping, auto-compounding, and investing across chains. DeFAI agents act as intelligent assistants equipped with wallet access, guiding users through complex DeFi operations and streamlining processes. By simplifying these tasks, DeFAI is making decentralized finance more accessible to both new users and experienced investors.
Examples of such agents include Fetch.ai — a platform that develops autonomous AI-driven tools to optimize trading strategies and execute smart DeFi transactions. Another example is AI-driven treasury management systems, where agents allocate funds across different DeFi protocols, optimize liquidity pools, adjust collateral ratios in lending platforms, and maximize yield strategies based on real-time market conditions.
AI agents enhance crypto trading through rapid trade execution in milliseconds alongside market trend analysis while reducing human involvement to minimum levels. Large language models are used by platforms like Kaito AI to aggregate and analyze crypto data from multiple sources to deliver real-time insights. Projects like AI16Z, with a market cap of $579 million as of February 2025, demonstrate how artificial intelligence is being integrated into trading solutions to enhance efficiency and decision-making.
The use of both mindshare (brand awareness and prominence in the market) and sentiment analysis is becoming a crucial part of trading as well. By using social sentiment from platforms like X and Reddit, and social intelligence tools, such as LunarCrush, autonomous trading bots can predict market movements and turn data into actionable real-time trading insights.
Decentralized platform Virtuals Protocol is leading the way by enabling users to create and co-own AI agents as digital assets. This approach allows for fractional ownership and revenue sharing, paving the way for investment and engagement in the AI-crypto ecosystem. Several AI agent coins are now available, including Virtuals Protocol’s AIXBT token, which has shown steady adoption since its launch in 2024.
Tokenized agents change the way users interact with AI systems by allowing them to benefit from an agent’s success or performance. This model both democratizes access to advanced technology and encourages collaboration between developers and investors.
AI agents analyze market data, identify fraudulent activities, and provide more accurate predictions boosting risk management protocols. As security concerns remain paramount in crypto adoption, these capabilities make AI agents a key tool for safeguarding assets. For example, Griffin AI’s Price Analyst, an autonomous agent launched in January, delivers real-time insights across over 2,000 cryptocurrencies. It uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze vast amounts of blockchain data, identifying unusual patterns that may indicate fraud or potential market manipulation. By continuously monitoring transactions and market trends, this AI agent aims to help traders make informed decisions while mitigating risks associated with scams or hacks.
Managing assets across multiple chains is one of the biggest challenges in DeFi. To solve this, AI agents are providing unified dashboards that aggregate crypto holdings from chains like Bitcoin, Solana, Ethereum, and others. These tools simplify portfolio management while offering real-time insights into asset performance across ecosystems. For example, CYBRO is an AI-powered multichain earn marketplace that offers access to top crypto investment options with automated portfolio management.
The trend of integrating crypto assets into traditional portfolio management systems is also growing. In 2022, BlackRock’s Aladdin, a leading investment management platform, teamed up with Coinbase to offer institutional clients access to crypto trading and custody services. Aladdin Copilot, an AI-powered assistant utilizing generative AI, now provides immediate insights, answers questions, and automates tasks on BlackRock’s platform.
AI agents are transforming the industry by tackling key challenges in the crypto space, enhancing market efficiency through autonomous trading and risk assessment, providing easier access to tools via tokenization and natural language interfaces, and improving the overall user experience.
The large valuations of pioneering projects underscore the growing demand for these technologies—and this is just the beginning. By making complex DeFi operations more accessible while improving scalability and security across blockchain ecosystems, AI agents are here to stay, reshaping companies like never before."

Hunters and shooters have been comparing the .308 vs .30/06 for decades. Some stand by the old warhorse .30/06 Springfield and others claim it’s descendant, the .308 Winchester, is better. Both are .30-caliber battle rifle cartridges that won the hearts of sportsmen worldwide. Though they have lots of similarities, it’s their key differences that give them their distinct advantages and disadvantages. If you’re making the .308 vs .30/06 comparison yourself, your conclusions will depend on one of those few factors where they don’t overlap.
 
The .30/06 name is a derivative of the cartridge’s .30-caliber projectile and the year it was introduced, 1906. Its parent case is the .30/03 Springfield. At the time of its inception, the .30/06 cartridge was the pinnacle of modern ballistics, launching a 150-grain projectile 2,700 fps. The .30/06 gained its notoriety on the battlefield, playing large roles in WWI, WWII, and the Korean War. Since its adoption, the 30-06 has become one of the most common and capable big-game hunting cartridges in America and around the world. 
Better performing ammunition has also improved the capabilities of the .30-06 with 150-grain bullets now regularly pushing nearly 3,000 fps. It can also leverage modern high-B.C. 225-grain bullets like the Hornady ELD-M. One of the many endearing qualities of the .30-06 is its ability to shoot a wide range of projectiles ranging from Hornady’s 125-grain SST bullets clear on up to Remington’s 220-grain Core-Lokt in factory ammo.
In 1952, half a century after the .30/06 was introduced, the .308 Winchester was born. Its parent case is the .30/06. The military version of the cartridge, the 7.62x51mm NATO, offered soldiers a rifle that nearly matched the ballistic performance of the 150-grain M2 Ball .30/06 ammo, but in a lighter, shorter package. The military saw the benefits of the new cartridge and converted some of, but eventually replaced, the M1 Garand service rifles, chambered in .30/06, with the M14 chambered in 7.62×51, aka .308 Win. 
Read Next: Is the Winchester Model 70 Featherweight as Good as It Used to Be?
Along with its rise in the military, the .308 Win. also became popular among hunters favoring short-action rifles and lighter recoil. 
Ballistically, the .30/06 shoots the same bullets a bit faster than the .308, resulting in better trajectories and more kinetic energy — but don’t put too much weight in that. The biggest edge the .30/06 has is being able to shoot bullets heavier than 180 grains effectively. Comparing ballistics of the two cartridges side by side, however, reveals the minimal gains made shooting the .30/06. Let’s look at two examples.
Hornady’s new Outfitter line includes a 150-grain CX bullet, which is a mono-metal (copper alloy) projectile. Here’s what the ballistics look like from the two cartridges, given a 200-yard zero.
Another example that features even less difference in performance between the two cartridges is Federal’s 165-grain projectile loaded in their Fusion Line. This is again with a 200-yard zero.
Inside 300-yards, the ballistics and terminal performance of these two cartridges would be nearly impossible to distinguish between. Yes, the .30/06 does provide a slight advantage in performance but that additional performance does come at a price in terms of felt recoil, more on this in a moment.
It’s worth noting that the .30-06 starts to pull away from the .308 as you move up to heavier bullets. For example, here’s how the two cartridges perform with a 180-grain Nosler Partition. 
The takeaway? The cartridges are very similar at typical hunting distances with moderate-weight bullets. But if you’re interested in shooting heavier bullets (180 grains and up) at farther ranges, the .30/06 does provide an advantage in retained energy.
Recoil is a big deal to some and not so much to others (even though it should be). When I was younger, I paid very little attention to felt recoil, chalking it up to a necessary evil of shooting. However, the older I get, the more I shy away from heavy-recoiling firearms. Neither the .308 Win. or 30/06 are known for being light recoiling cartridges, but they are not exactly punishing to shoot in standard-weight hunting rifles. Like their ballistics, comparing recoil between .308 vs .30/06 is more about the rifle weight. Given the larger case capacity and increased powder consumption, the .30/06 will typically produce more recoil than the .308 Win. For some very basic recoil figures, a 7-pound .308 generates about 21 foot-pounds of recoil compared to a 7-pound .30/06 generating about 25 foot-pounds of recoil. But these numbers don’t tell the full story, because the difference in felt recoil is more nuanced.  
The overall weight of the rifle, stock dimensions, use of a suppressor or muzzle brake, and load combination all contribute to the amount of felt recoil a rifle produces. Due to its short-action design, rifles chambered in .4308 Win. are typically a few ounces less than the same rifle chambered in 30-06. For example a Browning X-Bolt Medallion in .308 weighs 6 lbs. 8 oz. The .30-06 version of the rifle weighs 4 ounces more. 
More importantly, there are a variety of light mountain rifles available in .308, and fewer of these guns are chambered in .30/06. So if you’re looking for a light hunting rifle in .30-caliber (and don’t want the punishment of a big-booming .300 Win. Mag.) then the .308 is a good choice. Light rifles are great for backpacking but do generate more recoil. 
There are certainly ways to reduce felt recoil. While I loathe muzzle brakes, they do serve their purpose and reduce the amount of felt recoil for both cartridges. Even better, suppressors provide the same benefit of recoil reduction while saving our ears from the abuse of a muzzle blast.
Read Next: Why the .308 Winchester Will Never Die
Both the .308 Win. and .30/06 are capable of producing accurate results for hunting purposes. In competition, .308 vs .30/06 isn’t much of a comparison. The .308 quickly replaced the ’06 in high-power and service rifle rankings after it’s introdution. 
From a purely anecdotal point of view, I have had better success getting rifles chambered in .308 Win. to shoot sub-MOA than I have those chambered in .30/06. But remember, that’s an anecdote, not hard data. I think the reason that the .308 consistently out shoots the .30/06 in terms of accuracy is because of its more efficient cartridge design.
Given the modern advancements in rifle and ammunition manufacturing, there are plenty of factory rifles chambered in both cartridges that will shoot factory ammunition sub-MOA in three-shot groups and near MOA in five-shot groups. In Tyler Freel’s test of the best mid-priced rifles, he found that the best rifles shot about 1.3-inch, five-shot groups (this was done after averaging the 10 best groups from each rifle).
Read Next: The Best 308 Hunting Rifles
The vast majority of rifle companies all chamber and sell rifles in both .308 Win. and .30-06 due to their widespread popularity. The same can also be said for ammunition companies with .30/06 and 308. Win. ammo being among their top selling SKUs every year.
We already established that the .30/06 shoots a tad faster and subsequently packs more punch than the .308 Win. However, dead is dead and the buck or bull you settle your crosshairs on this fall will not know whether they were shot with a .308 vs .30/06. Instead of cartridge choice, hunters should focus on bullet construction when trying to maximize terminal performance. Thanks to the booming popularity of both of these cartridges, hunters have a smorgasbord of killer bullet options to choose from.
For maximum penetration on bigger game, shoot solid mono-metal bullets. Some of my favorite mono-metal projectiles include Hornady’s CX, Nosler’s E-Tip, and Winchester’s Copper Impact. 
For an all-around capable big-game option, you can’t go wrong shooting a bonded bullet such as the Nosler Accubond from either the .30/06 or .308 Win. Thin-skinned deer and pronghorn can be hunted with ease with both cartridges with just about any hunting bullet, though many prefer a rapid-expanding projectile to maximize internal trauma.
One of the biggest advantages to shooting both the .30/06 and .308 Win. is that ammo is almost always readily available. Even during the recent ammo shortage, .30/06 and .308 Win ammo could still be found. Cost varies based on ammunition brand and bullet type, but generally the .308 Win and .30/06 ammunition share similar price tags. For example, a box of 20 .308 Win. 150-gr. Remington Core-Lokt is listed on Midway USA for $28.99. That same box of ammo for the .30/06 is listed for the exact same price of $28.99. Average price for a box of 20-rounds for both cartridges will hover between $35 and $40.

No, the .30/06 is more powerful and can shoot heavier bullets
The military adopted the .308 because it produced similar ballistics to the .30/06 but was shorter and lighter, allowing soldiers to carry more ammo.
No, it’s not overkill. The .30/06 is an excellent deer cartridge, but smaller cartridges do work well too.
The truth is that you can’t go wrong with either of these cartridges when selecting your next big-game hunting rifle. Both carry ample killing power and provide hunters with a wide range of ammunition options. Given a similar rifle configuration, the .308 Win. will exhibit slightly less recoil and is inherently more efficient than the .30/06. But the .30/06 will edge it out slightly in velocity. That difference is somewhat negligible, but if you want to shoot bullets heavier than 180 grains, go with the .30/06. For any game in North America at modest distances, either is a good choice

In case you missed it, Nike is betting big on Kim Kardashian’s Skims. The pair have just announced a collaboration: NikeSkims, an activewear brand for women that will launch this spring.
Like most things Kardashian touches, the news created a big buzz. Within 24 hours of the announcement, Nike’s share price rose 6.2%, adding $6.7 billion to its market value.
Though Nike has partnered with many brands for limited sneaker runs (see: recent launches from Corteiz and Comme des Garçons), NikeSkims marks the first time the sportswear giant has launched  an entirely new brand with an outside company.
The collection will debut in the U.S. before a global rollout in 2026. It will offer women’s training apparel, then eventually footwear and accessories tailored for high-intensity workouts.
“We’re energized by the opportunity to build a new brand and shake things up for the next generation of athletes with NikeSkims,” said Heidi O’Neill, Nike’s president of consumer, product, and brand, in a statement. 
She added: “This partnership brings together the best of both brands and unlocks an incredible opportunity to disrupt the industry with our shared passion and commitment to innovation. We will invite even more athletes into sport and movement with products that make them feel strong and sexy.”
Here are five things you need to know about why the collaboration makes sense for both companies.
 
During the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, Nike came out fighting with an ad that extolled victory over decorum, declaring: “Winning isn’t for everyone.” 
The spot kicked off its fight to revive sluggish sales and restore its declining brand value which has been sliding since 2022, per Kantar.

Despite its Olympics and 2025 Super Bowl ad offensive, Nike’s most recent financial results show there’s still a hill to climb to reclaim its brand swagger. The Portland-founded company reported an 8% revenue dip in its most recent quarter, while direct-to-consumer sales dropped 13% to $4.7 billion.
There are several reasons for Nike’s ongoing sales slump, from consumers tightening their purse strings to a perceived lack of product innovation. However, a big one is increasingly tough competition from upstart running brands like Hoka and On. 
These newcomers have tapped into a shifting consumer preference for more specialized and innovative athletic wear. They’ve also inked buzzy partnerships with celebrities, including Zendaya.

Zendaya Links With Buzzy Sneaker Brand On for Cinematic Ad and Creative Role
  

For Christena Garduno, CEO of performance agency Media Culture, Nike’s creative output in this new landscape has felt stagnant and lacks the bold, game-changing designs that once set the brand apart. 
She told ADWEEK Nike needs to rethink its approach to stay relevant and ahead of the competition, which is why the Skims collab is a “brilliant move” that could be bolstered by Kardashian’s drive for “innovation.”
“From pioneering products like nipple bras and butt-enhancing shapewear to her collaborations with North Face for ski wear and Dolce & Gabbana, Kim has never shied away from pushing boundaries,” she said. 
She added strategic partnerships with celebrities including Tate McRae and Charli XCX have solidified Kardashian’s ability to command attention.
“As Nike works to re-establish itself as an innovator in the market, this partnership is a smart, forward-thinking move that will undoubtedly capture attention and bring new energy to Nike’s campaigns,” she added. 

  
In February, WNBA star Caitlin Clark and Olympic sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson were spotlighted in “So Win,” Nike’s first Super Bowl ad in nearly three decades, created by Wieden+Kennedy Portland. 
The ad comes as women’s sports are experiencing unprecedented attention, support, and investment. 
In tandem, there’s a growing appetite for women’s activewear that Nike could dominate. Per Verified Market Research, the market is expected to reach $95.3 billion by 2031. Adidas has been playing into this as well, investing more in women’s sports and designing tailored products for women.

It sounds like NikeSkims will be designed by women for women, with Kardashian saying in a statement that the brand would deliver products “meticulously designed to sculpt and perform for every body.” 
She added: “Every single detail has been obsessed over and carefully considered.”
 
Skims was co-founded in 2019 by Kardashian alongside fashion entrepreneur Jens Grede as “a solutions-oriented brand creating the next generation of underwear, loungewear, and shapewear.”
The DTC business quickly gained fame for its Spanx alternatives, but has since transcended that category. For instance, its recent menswear launch was promoted with a pop-up at Nordstorm’s flagship New York City store.
Skims been slowly but steadily moving into the world of sports. In 2023 it inked a multiyear underwear partnership with the NBA, WNBA, and USAB. 
Skims continued its partnership with Team USA for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games with a collection that included men’s, swim, and adaptive offerings.
 
In 1984, Nike signed a deal with NBA star Michael Jordan, kicking off a longstanding relationship with the then-Chicago Bulls rookie which rewrote the brand ambassador playbook and led to the creation of the Air Jordan brand.
Since then, Nike has partnered with countless high-profile athletes and A-listers, such as Serena Williams; Pharrell Williams; Colin Kaepernick; and Bella Hadid for ranges and promotions.

David Mayer, senior partner, director of marketing and customer strategy at branding agency Lippincott said Nike’s celebrity partnerships have historically had “a mixed record of fixing brand problems.”
However, he was optimistic the NikeSkims deal could help the sports behemoth connect with new communities and drive revenue, even if it does lead Nike into a more “fashion-led” territory. 
“Only time will tell; it’s a good way to rebuild relevance, but it may not replace the exercise of looking inward to determine what the brand stands for,” he said.
 
Nike’s shares have been slowly ticking up under new CEO Elliott Hill’s turnaround plan, and the markets have reacted well to the NikeSkims collaboration before it has even hit shelves.
Let’s not forget the Kardashians haven their own a legacy of building financially successful brands and monetizing their audience. They’ve risen through the celebrity rankings from E! reality TV stars to A-list multi-hyphenates over the last two decades.
Kim Kardashian owns multiple brands as well as Skims (which was valued at over $3.2 billion in 2023), including KKW Beauty and Skkn. 
Other family-held businesses are Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin (Kylie Jenner), denim brand Good American (Khloe Kardashian), and Poosh, Kourtney Kardashian’s Goop-esque sustainable living brand. 818 tequila is also owned by Kendall Jenner. 
Together the sisters’ combined Instagram is over 1 billion people, giving them plenty of power to influence.

Nikon has recently made waves with the comeback of the Nikon Coolpix P1100, a bridge camera that we never thought see the light of the day. However, we were proven wrong, thanks to the changing needs of consumers, especially those who are still learning the ropes. Soon after, we were also introduced to Nikon Z 35mm f1.2 S, which we already consider one of the best 35mm offerings from the company. With two launches behind us, it makes one wonder what Nikon could be launching in the coming weeks, and here is what you must look out for. 
According to Nikon Rumors, enthusiasts have a great deal to look forward to, with some being confirmed released and several rumors swirling around others. Here is what you can expect:
The article states that while the Z9 is still selling well, and with Nikon also slowing down its production this year to clear inventory, it may seem that we may not see the launch of the Z9 II this year. However, it is expected the device will launch a year or so down the line. We have already mentioned how the Z9 II must have new features, which include a better sensor, since the Z9’s sensor will be four years old by 2026. Content Credentials and autofocus performance on people of color in low light are a few more things that are a no-brainer for Nikon at this point.
The Z5 was officially launched in 2020, and five years later, there have been a few rumors that it will launch in spring. However, these sources have been unreliable and must be taken with a grain of salt. However, if the Z5 II is launched in the coming years, it will have to have a major makeover. In our review, we noted that the camera has some great features; it was something that every other camera maker was creating. With Nikon nailing the Z9, our hope is that the company will still have a chance to become better.
The Z8 was launched in 2023, and from there on, it seemed that Nikon was finally becoming a brand of its own. It was not trying to be the next Sony or Panasonic, but someone who has finally found its voice. The Z8 was essentially the Z9, but its autofocus could not compete with the Z9. So, if the Z8 II is announced the camera has to be more than jack of all trades.
Similarly, the Z7 II, launched in 2021, was a far better performer than the Z7. It had better autofocus and a more durable body, and the images were quite spectacular. It was a camera that could do wonders, depending on one’s shooting style. So, while it has been three years since its launch, it appears that the release may not happen anytime soon. Honestly, we did feel the camera was launched in a rush, so if we do get the Z7 III, it needs to be as great as the Z6 III is now.
Launched almost three years ago, the Z30 was a surprising launch that was not just affordable but also quite sturdy for $700 (body only). Although it has not been too long (considering cameras launched in 2020 still don’t have an update), it appears that the Z30 II is expected to be on the horizon. This is because Nikon launched the Z50 II, which is an APS-C that is targeted at content creators; the chances of Z30 II following in its footsteps are high. We do feel that Nikon, like other brands, does not understand the significance of the format and treats it as disposable devices, mere watered-down versions of other higher-end cameras. 
Nikon Rumors has also hinted at the launch of a new Z series 85mm lens, which is likely designed to complete the 35mm and 50mm f1.4 trio. Although there is no reliable information on what the lens could be about, it is likely that we will see something in the future soon. 
So far, while we do have a new camera and lens lineup, there is no clear indication yet of whether these launches will happen in 2025 or later. If Nikon is serious about changing itself, it may focus on improving the existing lineup through research and time, which other brands may not be focused on. Whatever the case, Nikon is on the right track, and they must stick to it."

Charging with MagSafe
There's been a lot of fear in the last few days that Apple left off MagSafe off the iPhone 16e because it somehow interfered with Apple's C1 cellular modem, but physics precluded that from the start. Here's how. Obviously, the iPhone 16e lacks MagSafe. There's been a lot said about it, and it's a problem for the device.Almost immediately, we heard whispers from case manufacturers that it may not have been cost-cutting, but instead was interfering with the C1 cellular radio. That was a silly proposition from the jump. Here's why.AppleInsider, why are you qualified to say this?We can talk about this because I've had a great deal of practical training and experience in limiting radiation exposure. In the US Submarine fleet, one of my jobs was ionizing radiation exposure measurement, control, and assessment.As part of that training, both in the start and end of my career, I had training on not just that, but monitoring of and exposure control from radio frequency broadcasts from high-power transmitters. And yes, magnetic flux too, since submarines can be detected by magnetic anomaly detectors carried by our arch nemeses, aircraft.Back to the inverse square lawIn the case of radio frequency exposure or magnetic field exposure from a point-source, something called the inverse-square law applies. In short, the intensity of the exposure is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from that object. A graphic representation of the inverse square law: credit WikipediaPractically, this means that the exposure to radio frequency power at a given distance of r is quartered at distance 2r. This operates on a very small scale, as well as a large one.For the scientific among us, as it pertains to the ""point source"" term up above —  there is also something called a ""line source."" However, for the purposes of very small magnets like in MagSafe, the line source math isn't relevant, and can effectively be ignored. Besides, relatively speaking, MagSafe magnets are very weakAnd, the main term when figuring out magnetic flux exposure is the strength of the magnet. MagSafe magnets are pretty weak, relatively speaking.The applicability of the inverse-square law to MagSafe magnets was proven in 2021 by this research study. Using a FW Bell 5180 Gauss Meter with STD18-0404 Transverse probe, the researchers found a magnetic flux of 110.36 gauss at 1 millimeter. At 11 millimeters —  more than the distance to the antenna, and probably about the distance to the modem itself, this dropped to 15.44 gauss.Anything less than 500 gauss is really of no concern to radio broadcasts at cellular frequencies. And, it's not the '80s where incredibly sensitive floppy disks are prevalent. Other aspects of the phone, like Flash media, aren't really impacted by magnetic flux. For comparison, refrigerator magnets are generally between 20 to 100 gauss. The earth's magnetic field is around 0.5 gauss. A MRI machine magnet is about 15,000 gauss.The advice to keep a MagSafe magnet away from your pacemaker remains good. But there was never any danger to interfering with RF from or to the C1 modem in the iPhone 16e.And besides —  there was never any concern with a Qualcomm modem.

But, it was clear from the start that Apple omitted the magnet ring to save production costs.Precision magnets are pretty expensive, truth be told. I asked around a bit before we published this article, and the best guess for the precision of the magnets Apple uses is probably right around $2 per unit.That doesn't sound like a lot, but when you multiply it by millions of dollars it's —  well. It's still not a lot for Apple, but it's a lot for us.Anyway, Apple doesn't cooperate with (most) case makers before a phone is released. They rely on rumors and supply chain innuendo to figure out what to make, ahead of time.There are millions of dollars at stake to be at market early with a case for an iPhone. You snooze, you lose, we've been told.So, the case manufacturers mostly took a guess that there'd be MagSafe on the iPhone SE 4. What we got was not that, obviously.We're certain that cases will pop out with a full-strength MagSafe magnet inside, and we'll be rounding the up soon. And, while the end result was inevitable, the testing to prove it that we've seen is still a positive.

It wasn't a rumor. It was speculative bullshit. For something to be a rumor, I presume the source of information has to come from someone associated with Apple or know of Apple's plans or inner workings. This one is just your typical post-iPhone launch speculative bullshit. There's always post launch bullshit. People love to revel in it and fling in it because the reality is too boring, or that they love think they have secret knowledge.For Apple product features, the first reason for why some feature are included, or not, is always product marketing and segmentation. Always. With people complaining about it so much, that is a clear sign that the Product Marketing group is doing its job. They want people to always go for the next model up, next upgrade option up. Same with the price of $600. A perfect lineup with no complaints is a sign of commoditization or poor product planning from the company.

92,2025-02-21,"The franchise has undergone a slow but significant shift
by  Kazuma Hashimoto
A large beast covered in fur dives through a small, circular arena in the Iceshard Cliffs, tendrils of segmented scales twisting away from its body as it lunges forward and attempts to knock me off balance. I dive between its legs, blades whirling, opening a wound on its exposed chest. Instinctively I take advantage of this opportunity, and in an instant I fly through the air, driving the curved edge of my dual blades over the length of its body, controller vibrating with each impact. Back arching with one final cry, it slumps to the ground and I immediately begin the task of harvesting its corpse for rare materials. A pop-up flashes on the right side of my screen. A new monster has entered the area. It’s time to hunt.
This is the core of Capcom’s Monster Hunter series. You travel out in the world to hunt large beasts of varying size — some more deadly than others. But as Monster Hunter has continued to burgeon in popularity, with Monster Hunter: World selling an additional 1 million copies in the lead-up to Monster Hunter Wilds, the series has undergone a fundamental shift: discarding the need for extensive battle preparations in favor of ease of access, an expanded narrative over simplicity, and story told mostly through text-based quests. It’s the team at Capcom pushing Monster Hunter further and further into the mainstream, for better or for worse.
The developers have continued to place an emphasis on narrative in Monster Hunter through Wilds. While the game has significantly fewer cutscenes (which you can skip this time around) than Monster Hunter: World and its Iceborne expansion, Wilds instead railroads you into forced walking segments where you listen to your companions converse about the current goings-on within whatever locale you are exploring for the first time. These moments are agonizing, purely for the pace and frequency with which they happen, and I doubt they would be more tolerable if the narrative were more interesting. These segments feel as though they were created to showcase just how much detail has been put into these new environments, with some prompts popping up to draw your attention to specific landmarks, but again, to ill effect. It kills any upward momentum the game has managed to create between hunts, which makes the first half of the game drag on.
The Monster Hunter Wilds developers clearly took a generous amount of inspiration from a handful of Indigenous peoples, like the Aleuts of North America or various Mesoamerican tribes. Wilds paints them in broad strokes to create a muddied visual and cultural identity for the native inhabitants of The Forbidden Lands. All we learn about them in the story, to any great degree, is that they are under siege by the wildlife with which they had previously coexisted in some kind of harmony shortly before our arrival — and it’s up to us to find out why. Your protagonist, the Hunter, will move from village to village, protecting these people from monsters, participating in cultural ceremonies that have gone awry, or digging deep into the underground of The Forbidden Lands to discover the true culprit behind what is throwing everything into a state of disorder. This story carries the same notes as Monster Hunter Rise, but instead of the Hunter being a part of the community, we are an outsider who is the only one capable of fighting back against the environmental hazards given flesh, accompanied by a mysterious Indigenous boy and a flock of other hunters setting up camp in this otherwise unexplored portion of the world.
As I was playing through Wilds, that was one of the things that stuck out to me the most — community. In previous titles, with World being the exception, your player character was part of the community. You lived in the region you hunted, fighting back against natural threats posed by monstrous wildlife. And while your comrades from the Hunter’s Guild do accompany you to The Forbidden Lands in Wilds, the camps you set up aren’t as fully realized as previous player hubs, with no communal areas to break bread or gorge yourself on sumptuous-looking slices of meat with other players. So much of Wilds feels antithetical to the narrative and themes of the series, as vague as they were, with much of it previously having been told through quest text as you move from hunt to hunt. Wilds lacks even this, with the game feeling stripped-down narratively and even in the way you interact with its changing environments.
There is no doubt the Capcom team put a significant amount of effort into the handful of regions you can explore, ranging from verdant jungles, frozen caves dusted with snow, and sprawling deserts. But there were only a handful of times in which I was actually able to appreciate the level of detail put into these areas, because most of the time I was on my Seikret, tapping a button to put it on autopilot to navigate to my next objective. It doesn’t help that you can just snatch up herbs, bugs, and other ingredients without even having to get down from the back of your new mount. You aren’t forced to engage with the environment in any significant way. In World, I was at least forced to remember landmarks, to take note of various hazards or even tangles of vines that could trap whatever I was hunting. I can’t say the same for Wilds, even if the very few moments I chose to stop to take in the scenery were exceptionally cool. Taking a break from gathering ore, I watched a bird land on an unassuming plant only to get devoured by it. I watched pterodactyl-like monsters land in shallow pools of water to slurp up small fish. I watched rain roll in through the Scarlet Forest and with it, the endemic life change almost entirely. All of this detail is incredible, but there isn’t any reason to engage with it, nor does the game actively encourage you to stop and notice it. Instead, you move mindlessly from hunt to hunt, with much more of the “tedious” aspects of the game removed.
You can cook on the fly, you can gather from the back of your Seikret, you can do just about everything on the field without reason to return to a main hub or one of your pop-up camps. Even supplies are sent to you intermittently. The only reason I ever actually did visit a camp was to stock up on traps and tranquilizers to capture monsters instead of slay them — which you’re taught to do after you complete the main story. In fact, so many basic upgrades are locked behind its completion. You actually can’t even upgrade your Palico’s skills without completing it. Thankfully the main story wasn’t very long, and I was able to beat it in under 10 or so hours. Completion time will probably vary from player to player, but once you’ve knocked that out of the way, you can actually get into the real meat of the game, as the main story is almost agonizingly easy to a veteran player.
I ran through the story with minimal upgrades; I only upgraded my weapon twice, opting for the paralyzing dual blades of the Lala Barina (which felt extremely overpowered), and my armor once to get some choice passives. I want to say Wilds is perhaps the easiest entry in the series yet, largely due to the new Wound system, which allows you to perform special attacks on monsters that deal devastating amounts of damage — often netting you monster parts or in some cases knocking them over. The dual blades had me tearing through even the most formidable monsters, lacerating their legs, puncturing their hides, and creating wound after wound to continue a cycle of just dealing a disgusting amount of damage over and over and over again in a way that almost felt mind-numbing. I zoned out during fights, my evade window so large that I could often get a boost from perfect dodging attacks, which meant when I would dodge I would also spin around in a flurry of blades, dealing even more damage. Frustrated, I switched to the Hunting Horn weapon to try and give myself a challenge. But the experience was mostly the same.
Even High Rank hunts, tempered monsters and all, felt a touch too easy. And as I clocked in at around 60 or so hours, having soloed the main scenario and all of the endgame content, I walked away feeling unsatisfied. There is not a doubt in my mind that the fun I will find with Monster Hunter Wilds will be with friends, because when I did jump into a multiplayer session with another reviewer, I was having a blast. It was fun coordinating attacks and being able to seamlessly join them on hunts. This is where I think Wilds shines — its multiplayer component and the general stability of online lobbies. Outside of a few hiccups on the end of the other player, online ran extremely smoothly, and there were no lobby issues for me like there were in World.
And for the most part, the game performed great. I experienced little to no frame drops on PC, even if lowering the texture quality to medium makes the game look less than ideal. Character models specifically look a bit muddy, and pop-ins are bound to happen. There were a few times my camera freaked out, which caused random triangles to pop up in the periphery of my screen if I swiveled my camera a bit too close to a wall. But I doubt most players are diving into Monster Hunter Wilds for the character creator, which is no Dragon’s Dogma 2 and does a serviceable job, or to scrutinize every little detail in the zones or on the monsters themselves. That said, the game was stable, and sometimes that’s all you can really ask for in something as ambitious as Monster Hunter Wilds.
Yet I continued to yearn for what the series used to be: the friction, the necessity of gathering and preparation for hunts, a larger sense of community, and a real challenge if you chose to go it alone. Monster Hunter Wilds is no doubt a step forward in a lot of ways, with the technical aspects of these games increasingly more impressive than the last. Though I can’t help but feel like the core identity of the series is getting lost along the way.
Monster Hunter Wilds will be released Feb. 28 on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X. The game was reviewed on Windows PC using a pre-release download code provided by Capcom.

94,2025-02-21,"The shortage of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-0.42%) blockbuster diabetes and weight-loss drugs is officially over, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The FDA updated its drug shortage database on Friday, marking the shortage of semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — as resolved. The news puts pressure on companies that have been able to sell off-brand, also known as compounded versions, of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs due to widespread shortages.
GLP-1 drugs, which mimic hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite, have become highly sought after for their weight loss effects. Soaring sales for these treatments have transformed Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY-1.00%), the maker of competing drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, into the most valuable pharma companies in the world. However, Skyrocketing demand and the drugs’ high list price has made it difficult for some patients to fill their prescriptions. Semaglutide had been listed on the FDA shortage list since March 2022. 
“We are pleased the FDA has declared that supply of the only real, FDA-approved semaglutide medicines is resolved, affirming that Novo Nordisk is meeting or exceeding current and projected nationwide demand,” said Dave Moore, executive vice president of U.S. operations at Novo Nordisk, in a statement. “No one should have to compromise their health due to misinformation and reach for fake or illegitimate knockoff drugs that pose significant safety risks to patients.”
Novo Nordisk stock jumped over 4% on Friday. 
The millennial-focused telehealth platform Hims & Hers (HIMS+0.19%), which began offering a compounded version of semaglutide last May, saw its stock drop by over 22% during Friday’s trading session.
Compounding refers to the customization of an approved drug by a pharmacy or physician to meet the specific needs of an individual patient.
Typically, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act prohibits compounding drugs that are just copies of commercially available medications. But drugs that are in shortage are not considered by the FDA to be commercially available. The limited supply of highly coveted and expensive brand name weight-loss drugs has spurred several digital healthcare companies to take advantage of that provision.
“Now that the FDA has determined the drug shortage for semaglutide has been resolved, we will continue to offer access to personalized treatments as allowed by law to meet patient needs,” Hims & Hers CEO Andrew Dudum said in a statement. “We’re also closely monitoring potential future shortages, as Novo Nordisk stated two weeks ago that it would continue to have ‘capacity limitations’ and ‘expected continued periodic supply constraints and related drug shortage notifications.’”
In July, the company added Kåre Schultz, a longtime Novo Nordisk executive, to its board of directors. At the time, Schultz told Bloomberg that the company has a “long future” in selling compounded semaglutide. When asked if pharmacies will still be able to make compounded semaglutide after the shortages end, Schulz said he wasn’t worried because there would still be cases where patients need individualized prescriptions.
The FDA said on Friday that state-licensed pharmacies and physicians, known as 503A compounders, must stop making and distributing semaglutide products by April 22. Outsourcing facilities, known as 503B’s, have until May 22 to do the same.
However, the FDA’s decision will likely face challenges from compounders, who have already sued the agency over its decision to declare a shortage of another weight-loss drug as resolved.
The FDA originally declared the shortage of tirzepatide — the active ingredient in Eli Lilly’s Zepbound — over in October. However, an industry group, the Outsourcing Facilities Association (OFA), filed a lawsuit in Texas against the agency just days later, challenging its decision to remove the drug from its shortage list and demanding that the move be reversed.
In its lawsuit, the group called the FDA’s decision “reckless and arbitrary,” and argued that it would “deprive patients of a vital treatment for type 2 diabetes and obesity.” The FDA said, in a court filing, that pharmacists could temporarily resume making compounded tirzepatide as it reconsiders its decision 
In a December letter, the agency stated that its review found Eli Lilly has sufficient supply to meet and exceed both current and future demand for the drugs. As a result, it set deadlines for compounding pharmacies — Feb. 18 for 503As and Mar. 19 for 503B’s — to stop selling off-brand versions of tirzepatide.

The update was made after a committee for Meta’s board of directors decided  “that the target total cash compensation for the named executive officers,” excluding Zuckerberg, “was at or below the 15th percentile” of executives in similar roles at a “peer group of companies” that Meta “benchmarks against” when determining executive compensation, the filing said. The Compensation, Nominating & Governance Committee approved the increase on Feb. 13. 
Now, “the target total cash compensation for the named executive officers (other than the CEO) falls at approximately the 50th percentile of the Peer Group Target Cash Compensation,” the filing said.
Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Meanwhile, the tech giant has started laying off workers after sending a message to company managers in January that it was planning to cut 5% of the workforce, and would be targeting low-performing employees.
“Meta is working on building some of the most important technologies in the world — AI, glasses as the next computing platform, and the future of social media,” Zuckerberg said in the memo. “This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams.”
Earlier this year, Zuckerberg said the tech giant is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capital expenditures on artificial intelligence in 2025. He added that he expects Meta AI to “be the leading assistant serving more than 1 billion people,” and that Meta’s Llama 4 model is expected to “become the leading state of the art model” this year.
The company’s stock climbed after it beat fourth-quarter earnings expectations and said it was planning to invest “hundreds of billions of dollars” in AI infrastructure in the longterm. Meta’s shares are up by almost 16% so far this year.

96,2025-02-21,"Stellantis, which counts Dodge, Jeep, and Chrysler among its portfolio of automobile brands, says its Level 3 automated driving tech is ready to take over the wheel and let you take your eyes off the road safely.
However, it's not launching these features just yet.
The automotive group's STLA AutoDrive 1.0 assistive system is said to be capable of automated driving at the push of a button, up to speeds of 37 mph (60 km/h) in traffic and on highways given 'certain conditions.' The idea is to free you up to comfortably use the car's infotainment screen, talk to co-passengers, and catch up on books or videos on long journeys and commutes.
That means that it will steer, accelerate and brake, and maintain safe distances from other cars autonomously. AutoDrive will also enable adaptive cruise control and lane centering at higher speeds, provided you're focused on the road ahead.
Stellantis says the system will work precisely at night and in light rain, and will even automatically clean your car's suite of sensors when needed.
Since it's a cloud-connected service, AutoDrive can receive updates to improve its capabilities, including functioning at speeds up to 59 mph (95 km/h), and tackling off-road routes.
A Stellantis spokesperson told The Verge it's not going live with these features right away: ""... the current market for Level 3 autonomous driving is very limited. We have made the strategic decision not to launch it at this time. Once the market opens up and becomes more receptive, we will move forward with introducing this advanced technology.”
Level 3, or 'hands-off, eyes-off' autonomy is tricky because it requires specific driving conditions to be met before it can be activated, and also requires human drivers to be able to take the wheel at a moment's notice.
That's both a technological challenge for automakers, and a difficult standard for regulatory authorities to sign off on.
That said, it's kinda-sorta out there already. Mercedes-Benz was the first to launch a SAE Level 3 system in commercial vehicles in Europe and the US, with its EQS fastback EV and ICE S-Class sedan back in 2023. 
Honda, Ford, GM, Volvo, Sony, Kia, and Xpeng also have Level 3 systems in the wings. We'll have to wait and see which models Stellantis decides to deploy its tech in when the winds are favorable.
