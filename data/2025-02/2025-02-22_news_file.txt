Premium smartphones are usually synonymous of hefty price tags, but Samsung has released an irresistible offer that feels almost too good to be true. Just a month after its grand debut, the Galaxy S25 Ultra comes with a massive discount that transforms this flagship Android into an accessible luxury.
One of the highlights of Samsungâs current offer is their âdouble the storage for freeâ deal: Essentially, the 512GB model now costs the same as the 256GB version which makes it a no-brainer to go for the higher storage option. Normally priced at $1419, the 512GB variant is now available for just $1299. And if youâre eyeing the top-tier 1TB version, itâs also massively discountedâdown to $1419 instead of its original $1659.

But thatâs just the beginning and Samsungâs trade-in program takes this deal to another level: If you have an eligible older smartphone to trade in, you can get up to $900 off the price of the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The list of qualifying devices is available on Samsungâs official website and if you hit the maximum trade-in value (if you trade in a Galaxy S24 Ultra, Z Fold 6 or Z Flip 6), you could walk away with the Galaxy S25 Ultra for an unbelievable $399 instead of $1419!
Samsung is throwing in additional perks for Galaxy S25 Ultra buyers by offering huge discounts on accessories to complete your setup. For example, you can grab the latest Galaxy Buds3 Pro for just $59 (down from $249) or pick up the Galaxy Watch Ultra for $297 instead of $649 (save over $300 on the most premium Android watch!). Thereâs even potential to resell these discounted accessories and use that extra cash to offset some of the remaining cost of the phone itself.
Now, letâs talk about what makes the Galaxy S25 Ultra such a unique and premium device: this smartphone features a stunning 6.9-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with QHD+ resolution (remember, Samsung is probably the best phone display manufacturer in the world and produces iPhones displays) which delivers vibrant colors and sharp details that make everything from streaming videos to gaming an absolute joy. Under the hood, itâs powered by Qualcommâs latest Snapdragon 8 Elite processor for lightning-fast performance no matter how demanding your tasks are.
The camera system on the Galaxy S25 Ultra is another major highlight: At its core is a groundbreaking 200-megapixel main sensor, supported by an ultra-wide-angle lens (improved from the previous Galaxy 24 Ultra) and two telephoto lenses with impressive optical zoom capabilities. This camera setup truly delivers professional-grade results every time, no matter how good you are in photography.
Samsung has also packed this phone with intelligent features that enhance everyday usability: The Galaxy AI system takes things to another level and offers real-time translation, smart search capabilities, photo editing and personalized summaries that help keep your life organized. Features like the Now Bar (which gives you quick access to key functions even when your phone is locked) and Now Brief (a customizable dashboard for important updates) add even more convenience.
With all these features and innovations, itâs no wonder people are comparing the Galaxy S25 Ultra to Appleâs iPhone 16 Pro. But hereâs where Samsung wins: thanks to this promotion, youâre getting a device that rivalsâand in some ways surpassesâthe iPhone 16 Pro at a fraction of its price. This offer will not last forever, and even the previous Galaxy S24 Ultra wasn’t that cheap for Black Friday. You should make sure you grab yours before it runs out of stock.

1,2025-02-22,"Cryptocurrency firm Bybit said hackers stole $1.5bn (£1.1bn) worth of digital currency in what could be the biggest crypto theft in history.
The Dubai-based company's founder told users that their funds were ""safe"" and that it would refund any of those affected.
It said hackers stole from its Ethereum coin digital wallet. Ethereum is the second largest cryptocurrency by value after Bitcoin.
Bybit's founder Ben Zhou said the money could be covered by the firm or by a loan from partners. Bybit holds $20bn (£15bn) in assets.
Bybit said the hackers exploited security features, then transferred the money to an unidentified address. 
After the theft, the value of Ethereum fell by around 4% on Friday, leaving it worth $2,641.41 (£2,090) per coin.
The scale of the theft would exceed a previous record, which was a $620m (£490m) heist of Ethereum and USD Coin from the Ronin Network in 2022.
Bybit was founded in 2018. US President Donald Trump and former Paypal chief Peter Thiel were reportedly among its early investors.

Bybit says it has more than 60 million users worldwide and offers access to various cryptocurrencies.
""Bybit is solvent even if this hack loss is not recovered, all of clients assets are 1 to 1 backed, we can cover the loss,"" Mr Zhou added.
The company said in a post on X that it had reported the case to authorities and that it was working ""quickly and extensively""  to identify the hackers.
Cryptocurrencies, which have become popular with investors, have sparked division as many criticise their value for being based purely on speculation, allowing their value to be easily manipulated.
Most recently, Donald Trump has been criticised for launching his own digital coin while saying he ""doesn't know much"" about the cryptocurrency.
The digital coin called TRUMP appeared on his social media accounts ahead of his inauguration and quickly became one of the most valuable crypto coins, but has since fallen significantly in value. 
It highlights security concerns within the digital currency market, which was hoping for renewed trust after Mr Trump launched his coin. His adviser and and multi-billionaire owner of Tesla, Elon Musk, has also in the past talked up Bitcoin.
In 2014, crypto exchange Mt Gox filed for bankruptcy after $350m (£210m) worth of digital currency had been stolen due to a loophole in its security. 
In 2019, hackers stole stolen $41m worth of Bitcoin from the Binance exchange in another major crypto-currency heist.

2,2025-02-22,"Welcome to the Japanese brand’s first U.S. food market.

There are very few things that will get me to travel all the way to Chelsea Market from Brooklyn, but when Muji, the beloved Japanese home and stationery store, announced a new food market inside of their Chelsea Market location, I knew I’d have to try it. Like everyone else, I’m a big fan of Muji’s journals, pens, and overall vibe, and I had high hopes for the snacks they were selling after I saw it all over my TikTok feed. It’s the chain's first food market in the U.S. complete with robot baristas and a menu of classic Japanese snacks like onigiri and curry.
Bonus: Gucci Pineapple (whose real name is Alden) wanted to join my food adventures this week because of his love for Muji—and for me. (He’s a comedian, musician, and more importantly, my boyfriend.) One of our favorite things to do together is explore the city through food. In other words, we like to eat a lot. He’s gluten-free, so Japanese food is always a welcome favorite in lunch and snack options.
Predictably, the vibes inside of the Muji store were amazing. Organized, quiet, and with the ambiance of their little steam aromatherapy machines in the background, it was a big contrast to the usual chaos of Chelsea Market. We walked further into the store and could not ignore the barista robot in a clear, laminate cubicle making an iced latte. Fitted with googly eyes and a weirdly soothing voice, this robot known as “Jarvis” was the center of some controversy and is one of the attractions that brings people to the Muji food market. We started there and then ordered food at the counter in the back of the store.
Oatmilk Rose Latte (made by a robot barista). Alden liked this drink a lot, but for me, the rose syrup was a bit too pronounced. We watched the coffee-making robot—excuse me, Jarvis— pour the steamed milk into the cup in amazement. Surprisingly, the milk pour made a little heart. Unsurprisingly, it took Jarvis almost eight minutes to serve us our latte. I’ll admit I went into the experience feeling biased about robot baristas, but it probably would have been faster with a real person making it.
Right next to Jarvis’s cubicle is a counter where you order food and see all the options in a cute little case. They have a chic tiled bar with stool seats for you to enjoy your Muji branded lunch and gaze at their pre-packaged, shelf stable food offerings while you eat. We decided to order basically everything we could that was gluten-free.
Japanese beef curry. Who doesn’t love a warm beef curry on a winter day? Well, us. I usually expect a Japanese curry to have some veggies and a pillowy rice texture. The bowl was doing the bare minimum, just saucy meat on barely warm rice. Alden and I didn’t love it, nor did we appreciate the price: $15.
Spicy tuna onigiri. This for some reason had gluten in it, so I sampled it solo. I am a big fan of onigiri as an on-the-go lunch, and this one needed more filling—plus, I didn’t detect any spiciness. Meh.
Ume onigiri. Alden loves ume (pickled plum) onigiri, so this was exciting. Alden used to work on a farm in Oregon, and the lovely woman who co-owned the farm would make us these incredible ume onigiri with plums she grew on her land. Anyways, the Muji version was pretty solid. Perfectly salty, no notes!
Kombu onigiri. Kombu is a type of dried seaweed known for its umami and sometimes sweet flavor. I loved this onigiri off of the first bite because the seaweed was sweet and soft. Alden prefers salty over sweet and wanted to have more of the ume instead of the kombu. Well, more for me!
While both Alden and I love Muji as a store, we mutually decided their little Chelsea food market was massively overrated. Like Alden said, the food was a bit stale and meh. Not every spot can be perfect! Either way, Alden and I left with full bellies.
If you’re reading this and you have a suggestion for a Snack Shop in the city that I must visit and (honestly) rate, leave a comment here or on our Snack Shop TikTok video. I love suggestions!

3,2025-02-22,"In an interview, Dr. Lee Zhang acknowledged that the OnePlus Watch 3's size and lack of LTE are problems to be solved.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

As much as the OnePlus Watch 3 has impressed us so far with its incredible battery life, we don't know how long it would last with a lighter, more comfortable case size. But based on statements from Dr. Leo Zhang, the Head of R&D at the OnePlus Health Lab, they're ""working on"" a smaller OnePlus Watch that should answer that question soon.
PULSE by Wareable, which interviewed Zhang, quotes him as saying, ""It’s true that the [46mm OnePlus Watch 3] remains heavy for a small wrist and that this typically affects women, but we will fix that this year. We value our customer’s voice and we’re working on that.""
As much as the OnePlus Watch 3 improved on the Watch 2, a smaller model was one of the few requested changes that OnePlus didn't deliver this year. The Watch 3 weighs about 50g without the strap or 80g with it; that's lighter than the 60g Galaxy Watch Ultra, but significantly heavier than the 34g Galaxy Watch 7 or 37g Pixel Watch 3 with comparable display sizes.
Given that OnePlus will ""fix that"" in 2025, we could theoretically see a smaller OnePlus Watch 3R this summer — a successor to the sporty Watch 2R — but the Watch 4 in 2026 seems more likely. Either way, we think plenty of people would lose a day or two of battery life and swap from a 1.5- to 1.3-inch display to make the OnePlus Watch 4 less distractingly hefty.

In this same interview, Wareable asked Zhang about the lack of an LTE option in North America and Europe.
""The technology isn’t a problem, that part is quite simple,"" Zhang explained. ""In China’s domestic market, we have an LTE version. In an overseas market, we need to work with the carriers—and that’s a big hurdle. We need to work with carriers so users can put in an eSIM and have a data plan.""
Zhang continued on to tell the site that they're also ""working on"" adding LTE by speaking with carriers, ""especially in Europe.""

Unlike his promise about a smaller OnePlus Watch, he didn't give a timetable for adding LTE, whether to the Watch 3, Watch 4, or a later model. And based on his words, it appears OnePlus's first priority will be to bring LTE to Europe before it focuses on the United States, where its wearable sales may be lower.
OnePlus has had a slightly messy Watch 3 launch week, given its ""Meda in China"" typo and a disappointingly short update promise. Despite this, we're highly encouraged to see OnePlus prioritizing a smaller watch design, in order to make its watches more competitive with the other best Android smartwatches.

4,2025-02-22,"A thin foldable phone is just the start.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

OPPO just launched the Find N5, an incredibly thin foldable phone that should have Samsung shaking in its boots. The phone is about as thin as a standard unfolding smartphone but with much more display. In fact, when closed, the Find N5 feels no different than a regular phone yet still manages to fit plenty of flagship specs and features. It feels too good to be true, and yet it still sets a new standard for phones that I hope to see other OEMs strive for.
I’ve been using the OPPO Find N5 for about a week now, and while I still prefer flip phones to large foldables, what OPPO has done here is something special. This phone is pretty much the full package; it has a Snapdragon 8 Elite with phenomenal performance, a pretty great set of Hasselblad cameras, impressive displays, and a battery that’s larger than the unit in the much thicker Galaxy Z Fold 6.
That last part is especially important because OPPO is following Honor’s example by launching a very thin foldable, then calling out Samsung for its embarrassingly thick phone. The company highlights that the thinness was partly a result of its battery technology that recently made its way to the OnePlus 13, sporting 10% silicon to produce a denser battery unit that doesn’t compromise on capacity or charging speed.
This is a big deal, one that spans not only candybar phones and the current batch of foldables flooding the market but could also have far-reaching effects on more niche form factors and other device categories.

OPPO and OnePlus have shown that with this new way of building batteries, there are essentially two ways they can go about implementing it. Clearly, the OPPO Find N5 took the ""less is more"" route by aiming for a very thin phone. This is important because we've seen that thin phones are set to make a comeback, and the more battery we can stuff into them, the better.
This has been a point of contention for some when it comes to upcoming devices like the Galaxy S25 Edge. Even among Android Central staff, there seems to be a divide between those who want a thin phone and those who are concerned about the sacrifices needed to get there. I'm somewhat in the middle, leaning toward now wanting to deal with a battery that will only get me through half a day of use (I'm past the days of using the Razr Plus 2023).
The rumors of the Edge also don't leave us with much confidence that Samsung has it figured out, although we still won't know much until the official launch, whenever that is.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
Of course, Samsung isn't the only one shooting for thin. Apple is rumored to have a very slim iPhone set to launch this year, which gives credence to the return of the thin phone trend of years past. After all, Apple rarely does anything without a ton of market research and a solid plan, so either this is something that customers are yearning for, or it's something Apple wants them to want.

On the other hand, the OnePlus 13 went with the ""more is more"" route. Instead of aiming for thinness, the phone arrived with a battery that's 600mAh larger than its predecessor. That's no small feat, especially given that the phone is still thinner and lighter than the OnePlus 12.
What this tells me is that companies may no longer have to choose between providing a svelte design or good battery life; you can have your cake and eat it, too. Of course, it may take a generation or two before other companies actually catch up. Batter tech is slow to evolve and catch on, and Samsung learned the hard way that rocking the boat in that department can lead to some explosive outcomes.

While this is a great way to mark the OPPO Find N5 as the thinnest foldable phone, the implications go beyond OPPO and the devices we currently have on the market.
Multi-fold devices have begun cropping up, mostly as concept phones, but with one commercially available device from Huawei hitting the global market. It's a magnificent feat of engineering, one that seems like overkill until you get one in your hands. You start to see the benefit of having a phone that could turn into a full-blown tablet... that is until you close the thing.
The Huawei Mate XT is nearly 13mm when folded, which admittedly feels pretty ridiculous, even compared to the 12.1mm Galaxy Z Fold 6. What's more is that Samsung is rumored to have a multi-fold phone in the works, with the company showing off various concept devices over the years. Unfortunately, given Samsung's track record with foldable design and the downward trend of its sales in the segment, I could see this being dead on arrival. No one wants a 14 or 15mm-thick phone protruding out of their pockets.
This is why the Find N5 gets me excited. I can see this as the precursor to an eventual multi-fold phone from the company, with OPPO shaving a few millimeters off the 12.8mm thickness of the Mate XT. That would help make this new type of foldable a more palatable option for consumers in the market for a versatile smartphone.

Other devices and form factors also stand to gain from this. We've already seen what OnePlus and OPPO can achieve with the new OnePlus Watch 3/OPPO Watch X2, which can last a full five days in smart mode and 16 days in power save mode. That's more than any other Wear OS watch, and it's the result of OnePlus and OPPO squeezing in a much larger battery without the watch becoming too unwieldy.
I'm particularly excited about how this can improve flip phones. Despite being my favorite smartphone form factor, I recently laid out my grievances with flip phones and the compromises that come with them, including the thick was of the devices when folded. After all, what's the point of having a compact phone when it's literally double the thickness of a normal smartphone when folded?

During a briefing at the Find N5 launch, OPPO hinted that the advancements we see in its battery tech could arrive in a future flip phone. And while we have no official word on a long-awaited successor to the Find N3 Flip, this all but tells me that we could be in for a thinner, more impressive flip phone sooner than I had hoped. Motorola had better watch out!

Samsung has been very vocal about making foldables mainstream and has invested a lot of money into making that happen. The Z Fold and Z Flip series had a few years of impressive growth thanks to refined design, enhanced durability, and improved durability. However, we've seen growth slow down lately, which seems to coincide with Samsung's perceived slowdown in innovation.
As a result, Samsung is reportedly lowering its shipping targets for its upcoming foldables. However, its recent quarterly earnings report hints that Samsung is confident that its foldable offerings this year could help drive more demand as the competition seemingly surpasses it in terms of design, innovation, and even shipments.
There's really no reason the largest Android OEM should be ceding its foldable crown to others. However, after the launch of the Find N5, there's a lot riding on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to bring something exciting.
With OnePlus skipping a 2025 launch of a OnePlus Open successor, Samsung now has the perfect opening to take back its foldable crown without too much competition getting in the way. And with any luck, Samsung will take a page from competitors like OPPO when it comes to design to give us thin, durable, and exciting foldable phones. Because if it won't, we can be sure Apple's eventual foldable will.

6,2025-02-22,"The first iOS 18.4 beta dropped yesterday, and includes an exciting smart home addition that previously went under the radar. As tested by Jonathan at Smart Home Centre, the Home app now supports robot vacuums and mops that integrate with the Matter protocol.
Right now, the only compatible model on the market is the Switchbot S10 Robot Vacuum and Mop, but many other manufacturers have pledged support for Matter with forthcoming software updates.
While almost all of these vacuums have iPhone apps you can control them with, the native support through the Home app enables Siri voice commands and integration in the unified dashboard alongside all your other smart home accessories. You can also then include the vacuum and mop actions in your normal HomeKit automations and scenes.
Once configured, you’ll be able to control your vacuum with voice commands on your iPhone, HomePods, Apple TV and any other iOS device. 
The Apple Home app includes a simple-but-capable set of controls for the S10 robot vacuums. You can tell the vacuum to start cleaning, or tell it to stop a session in progress, enable or disable the mop and set a preset vacuum cleaning mode (like Quick or Deep Clean options). There’s also a “Send to Dock” button which should tell the vacuum to return home to its charging station. 
For more advanced robot vacuum and mop features, like room mapping or setting custom routes, you will still need to open the companion app from the manufacturer. But for the fundamentals, you’ll be able to do it just through the Apple Home app. 
iOS 18.4 is currently in developer and is expected to be released publicly as a free iPhone software update sometime in April. Matter robot vacuum support is also available in the next version of other Apple operating systems, like iPadOS 18.4, tvOS 18.4, watchOS 11.4, and macOS 15.4.

Winters in Colorado are cold, but real estate in the Centennial State is anything but.

        One of the billionaire Koch brothers is trying again to sell his lavish Aspen compound, this time for its highest-ever asking price: $125 million.
    

        If the estate were to sell for anywhere close to that price, it would be the most expensive home ever sold in Colorado.
    

        Two other billionaires — the former casino mogul Steve Wynn and the financier Thomas Peterffy — set the current record in April, paying $108 million for a 22,405-square-foot Aspen home. It marked the first time a sale in the state reached nine digits, placing Aspen among other rarified communities where properties trade for that much, including New York, Los Angeles, Palm Beach, and Miami.
    

        Bill Koch sold his stake in the family conglomerate, Koch Industries, to his brothers for $470 million in 1983. Fast forward to 2007, when Koch spent a relatively small sum — $26.5 million — on a former dude ranch near the posh ski town of Aspen.
    

        Today, after extensive renovations, it has a 16,600-square-foot main lodge and seven cabins, one of which is a home gym. The total square footage of all the structures is about 25,300. The 53-acre property also offers ample Aspen-suitable amenities, including hot tubs, hiking trails, and an altitude-acclimation room.
    

        Koch — whose net worth Forbes estimated to be $2 billion as of Friday — told The Wall Street Journal recently that the $125 million asking price was appropriate given that a few of the area's ultraluxury homes had sold for about $6,000 a square foot.
    

        ""If we applied that to our 25,000 square feet, our asking price would be $150 million,"" Koch told the Journal.
    

        ""Scarcity fuels luxury sales in Aspen's real estate market,"" Koch's listing agent Steven Shane, of Compass, said in an email. ""Just as high-end brands like Herms and Rolex create demand through limited availability, Aspen's appeal outpaces its real estate demand.""
    

        Take a look inside Koch's massive compound for sale and read about his journey to find a new buyer.

The United States is leading the world's richest democracies in real wage growth.

        Data from the OECD shows that between 2019 to 2023, the United States and Canada saw their average wages increase by 5.2% and 3.6%, respectively, when adjusted for inflation.
    

        Meanwhile, workers' pay in other G7 countries, a group of industrialized democratic economies, has not kept up with inflation, meaning their paychecks have effectively shrunk since 2019.
    

        Italian average wages fell 5.7% between 2019 and 2023. Inflation in Japan this year has hit a 19-month high, marking a continuing trend of a weakened yen and dropping real wages in the country.
    

        The OECD's measure accounts for the differences in cost of living and inflation to accurately compare someone's purchasing power between countries.
    

        While Americans are still feeling the pain of inflation — largely due to housing, energy, and gasoline — overall price growth has slowed significantly from 2022 highs. As of January, inflation was 3% year-over-year, compared to a rise in the consumer price index of 1.8% in France and 2.4% in Canada.
    

Eggs have been a particular pain point in the US recently. The price for a dozen Grade A large eggs has doubled over the past year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.
    

        While inflation is slowing, the Federal Reserve has opted to hold on further interest rate cuts so far this year despite pressures from President Donald Trump to continue cutting.
    

        Fed Chair Jerome Powell gave a policy report to the House Financial Services Committee in February expressing that ""the economy is strong overall."" He stated that his priorities in policy restraint were to keep prices stable and maximize employment.
    

        While new jobs increased less than the forecast in January, unemployment crept down to 4%, low by historic standards. And overall, the real GDP in 2024 grew 2.3% year-over-year as consumer spending made up for losses in investment, the latest data said.
    

        Economic data aside, Americans are split along party lines on the future of the economy in 2025. Per Pew Research's polls published this month, 64% of Democrats say the economy will get worse, and 73% of Republicans anticipate it will get better. A majority of people are optimistic about the costs of gasoline improving while also pessimistic about a hike in the cost of housing, food, and healthcare.
    

        Trump ran on campaign promises of bringing grocery and gas prices down and installed pro-oil and gas cabinet members to execute his ""drill baby drill"" plan. It's unclear, however, whether companies will be able or willing to expand oil production beyond current record highs.
    

        When it comes to food, Trump has since walked back his vow, saying lowering grocery prices is ""very hard."" Economists and companies have also indicated that Trump's proposed tariffs could increase prices for a variety of products.
    

        In the meantime,Powell has stated that the central bank operates independently of politics and he continues to watch the markets closely before intervening.
    

        ""If the labor market were to weaken unexpectedly or inflation were to fall more quickly than anticipated, we can ease policy accordingly."" Powell said to the House committee last week.

Huawei Honor Android Other

Counterpoint conducted a market analysis of the Chinese foldable smartphone market and recorded steady growth in 2024. Even though foldables represent only 3% of all smartphone sales in the country, the 27% growth compared to 2023 is pretty impressive.
China is also the most competitive foldable market, as many manufacturers sell their foldables only there. Even so, Huawei solidified its first place as more than half of sales in China were Huawei phones. The Huawei Mate X5 and Mate X6 are the best-sellers in the book-type foldables category while the Pocket 2 and Nova Flip are the most sought after clamshell-type handsets.
Interestingly, Honor is the only other manufacturer with double-digit market share with its highly successful Magic Vs2 and Vs3.
The research also found that 67% of the users prefer the book-type form factor.
Analysts say that foldables are no longer exclusive to enthusiasts and male users. With advancements in the field allowing for more lightweight and compact devices that are more durable and offer better cameras, regular consumers and women have started to see the appeal, hence the continued rapid growth of the rather niche market throughout the past few years.

BERLIN — An economic slump, an immigration crisis and the lifting of a security blanket provided for decades by its most powerful ally are on the minds of German voters as they head to the polls for Sunday's national parliamentary election. 
The general election of the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, was not supposed to come until September of this year. But on Nov. 6, just a day after American voters elected Donald Trump to a second term in office, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired his finance minister after months of squabbling over how to revive Germany's struggling economy, leading to the collapse of Scholz's three-party coalition government and the call for a snap election.
The latest polling data shows Scholz's Social Democrats in third place among voters (16%), behind the far-right Alternative for Germany or AfD Party (20%) and the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) alongside its Bavarian sister CSU party (29%).
The CDU will likely emerge as the largest vote-getter and thus be in the position of forming a coalition government with one or two other parties. Since all of Germany's mainstream parties have vowed not to govern with the AfD, which is under domestic surveillance for the threat it poses to Germany's democracy, the CDU's candidate for chancellor, Friedrich Merz, may have a difficult time forming a coalition government.
""I'm just worried that after the election that it will take maybe two months for a coalition government to form,"" says Jana Puglierin, director of the Berlin office at the European Council on Foreign Relations. ""Once the coalition is in place, they need to draft a budget. And if we are very lucky, all of this will be done before the parliamentary summer break.""
The expected drawn-out German political timetable worries observers because of the next government's urgency to deal with multiple crises that face Europe's largest economy. These include an economic recession, a national debate over migration, and, perhaps most importantly, how to navigate a new global security order now that the Trump administration appears to be working with Russia to bring an end to Moscow's war in Ukraine without inviting Europe or Ukraine to the negotiating table.
Whichever parties form the next coalition government in Berlin, Merz remains Scholz's likely successor. He is a 69-year-old conservative who hails from a family of lawyers. In addition to serving as a CDU member of parliament, Merz has also worked as a corporate lawyer and as a member of the supervisory board for the German branch of Blackrock, the largest asset management company in the world.
Merz's longtime colleague Norbert Röttgen, who also serves as a CDU member of Germany's parliament, says Merz is a politician of conviction. Röttgen has known Merz for more than 30 years. The two entered parliament together and have worked side by side through successive governments. He says Merz has strong beliefs: ""Societally conservative, traditional values and a strong, free-market conviction that liberal markets serve the people,"" says Röttgen. ""And he is a fundamental pro-European trans-Atlanticist.""
Röttgen says Merz's convictions will prove useful as Germany is faced with difficult decisions after the United States has signaled changes in how it sees its European allies.
The outgoing administration has not helped build a cohesive way forward for Europe on Ukraine, Puglierin says. ""I think Merz, by disposition, would be more open to also support Ukraine more decisively,"" says Puglierin. ""But he has to work in a framework. He will be constrained by his coalition partner and also by the German population.""
After coalition talks and tackling a budget that the Scholz administration left on the table, it might take months before Merz has the opportunity to put his mark on Germany, Puglierien says. 
Hints of how he will lead, though, have trickled out in recent weeks, as Merz got into trouble with his own party when he agreed to work with the AfD late last month to pass a motion that would have toughened up Germany's immigration policy. The motion failed after significant backlash against Merz for agreeing to work with a party seen by mainstream political parties as anti-democratic.
Voter Ute Wolters, a 64-year-old architect from Lower Saxony, worries about Merz's potential leadership. ""He claims to be up to the job, and we know he's a good businessman, but I worry he will go back on his promise to never enter into a coalition government with the AfD,"" she says, referring to repeated vows Merz has made throughout the campaign. 
Another voter, Ulrich Hinz, a 74-year-old retired businessman from Frankfurt, says he thinks Merz's pro-European outlook could help at such a trying time for Germany. 
""We need a chancellor and a government that is more European and one that can get along better with the French, Italians and the Poles,"" he says. ""That's the only way we are going to be able to keep up with China, Russia, and the United States.""

13,2025-02-22,"Kevin Hart found himself in the red when, after working as a sales rep for State Farm for a few years, he opened his own branch in 2017.
""I was dead broke and at a failing insurance business,"" the Louisville native told Business Insider. ""I had a $50,000 business loan I had to pay back at some point. I had a bunch of credit card debt from trying to get that business going.""
Hart wasn't in a financial hole for long. In 2019, he flipped his first home. He said it profited about $30,000, which he split with his business partner at the time. Before the end of that summer, he purchased two more flips and left insurance to work in real estate full time.
He said that his success flipping, and later wholesaling, helped him pay off his debt in two years: ""There's not much else out there where you can make lump sum checks to help you pay off that debt.""
Hart now works alongside a different business partner, Mike Gorius. They formed an official business partnership in 2024 under the Joe Homebuyer franchise and, in their first full year working together, did 50 transactions between wholesales, wholetails, and flips. They also own more than 20 rental properties, including short-, mid-, and long-term, in the Lousiville area. BI verified their property ownership and deal history by looking at settlement statements and closing documents.
They agree that rookie investors should consider starting with a flip for a ""quick capital boost to help you get going,"" said Hart, whose two-pronged real estate strategy involves flipping and wholesaling to bring in cash, and then buying and holding rentals.
Of course, when it comes to flipping homes, there's always risk involved. To minimize risk and avoid losing money on your first flip, Hart and Gorius highlighted three costly mistakes.
1. Hiring the first contractor you find. Unless you're planning on doing all of the renovation work yourself, you're going to need to work with a general contractor — and finding the right person for the job is key to a successful flip. This is the person you'll be relying on to transform a fixer-upper into a marketable home.
Avoid selecting ""some random contractor you find online,"" said Hart. ""You definitely don't want to hire the cheapest one you find. They're probably cheap and available for a reason.""
Instead, interview multiple contractors, call references, and look at their previous work. The more due diligence, the better off you'll be.
Keep in mind that there are residential contractors and contractors who work with investors. You want to work with the latter because ""they understand what flippers are looking for,"" said Hart.
2. Biting off more than you can chew. ""Don't take on a project that's way bigger than you can handle,"" said Hart, acknowledging that it's easier said than done, especially if you draw inspiration from HGTV shows that tend to feature full gut renovations. ""That's not what you want on your first flip.""
If he was starting from scratch in Louisville, he said he'd target a 3-bedroom, 1-bath ranch-style house that could use cosmetic upgrades: ""Floors, paint, kitchen cabinets, update the bathroom and a few minor things like light fixtures and call it a day. You don't want to start a huge construction project when you have no experience doing construction.""
Stick to the basics, added Gorius: ""Don't pretend that you're the one moving into this house and start putting finishes on there that are overpriced or don't make sense. Stick with what works, talk to contractors, and walk other people's flips to see what finishes and paint colors and materials they're using, because they're doing that for a reason.""
Their goal with a flip is to create a home that appeals to the most amount of people possible, which means neutral colors and flooring.
""In reality, if you're doing a lot of flips, flipping is a pretty boring business,"" said Hart. ""You're using the same paint colors, you're using similar flooring. Whatever's in style that year, we're like, 'Okay, for the next five houses, this is what we're doing.'""
3. Running your numbers too optimistically. Assume the project will cost more money and take more time than you think.
""Get really good at running your numbers, and be realistic about it,"" said Hart, who built his own flipping calculator in Excel. That means, if you're running comps and see that one home in your market sold for $250,000 but the rest are selling for $220,000, ""you can't get too excited and think, 'my house is going to be worth 250.' More likely, it'll be 220 or 230. Don't try to force the numbers to work.""
Allow yourself a financial cushion because, especially as a new flipper, ""something inevitably is going to go wrong or you're going to miss something in the rehab,"" he said. ""It always happens. You can't go out there and project a flip is going to make $10,000 off the bat, and all of a sudden, you buy it and miss this $10,000 foundation issue and now you're in the hole. So you just have to make sure you're buying correctly and getting your rehab cost as accurate as possible.""

Germany's federal election this Sunday will be the latest European political race to pit establishment parties against populist upstarts, most notably the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its coalition partners against the Alternative fr Deutschland (AFD), which counts Elon Musk among its fans.

        The beleaguered German economy is bound to be a central issue. Friedrich Merz, the CDU leader expected to become chancellor, has campaigned on cutting taxes, red tape, and energy costs to deliver an economic renaissance.
    

        Here's how Germany got to this point, the problems plaguing its economy — and how they could be solved.
    

        Germany rebuilt its economy after World War II to become a manufacturing powerhouse, building and exporting goods such as industrial machinery and high-end cars.
    

        It has just under 84 million people and ranks as the world's third-largest economy, with a GDP of $4.7 trillion. That's behind the US at $29.2 trillion and China at $18.3 trillion, according to International Monetary Fund estimates for 2024. Germany's economy is bigger than of Japan at $4.1 trillion, the United Kingdom at $3.6 trillion, and France at $3.2 trillion.
    

        However, the German economy contracted in 2023 and 2024 while all those peers grew, with the exception of Japan last year, and is set to lag behind its peers once again in 2025. The IMF forecasts 0.3% growth in real GDP this year, compared to 2.7% for the US, 4.6% for China, 1.1% for Japan, 1.6% for the UK, and 0.8% for France.
    

        A key driver of Germany's slowdown is weakness in its core economic activities. Industrial output has tanked more than 10% since 2019, and about 350,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost over the same period, government data shows.
    

        Auto giant Volkswagen, chemicals behemoth BASF, and steel and industrial goods titan Thyssenkrupp have shed more than $50 billion or about a third of their market value in the past five years, as investors have soured on German industry.
    

        Myriad signs of economic decline are ""fueling the sense that Germany's best days are behind it,"" Stefan Koopman, a senior macro strategist at Rabobank, said in a report this week.
    

        The far-right AfD ""capitalizes on this anxiety, blending restorationist rhetoric with extremist elements"" and ""channels economic and migration concerns into a broader narrative of national decline,"" he added.
    

        In December Elon Musk said on X that ""only the AfD can save Germany"" — and has since posted about the party dozens of times, as well as interviewing its leader, Alice Weidel, on his social media platform.  
    

        Germany's past energy policies are key to explaining its economic pains.
    

        For decades, Europe's biggest economy relied on cheap Russian gas to manufacture everything from steel to chemicals for export. However, Russia's invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 caused energy prices to soar.
    

        German officials also moved to punish Russia by reducing imports of its oil and depending on more expensive liquefied natural gas (LNG) and renewable sources instead, which eroded their country's appeal to some foreign businesses.
    

        Moreover, authorities began shuttering the country's nuclear power plants in 2011 after the Fukushima disaster in Japan, closing the final three in 2023. That decision made Germany even more reliant on Russian energy, making the weaning process even more painful.
    

        Until about 10 years ago, German manufacturers saw China as a huge export market.
    

        But since then, China has become much more of a competitor to Germany as it has ramped up exports of rival products including steel, machinery, solar panels, and electric vehicles.
    

        Cheaper production costs and looser regulations in China have also led numerous German businesses to shift at least part of their operations there.
    

        Germany has topped the UN's ranking of industrial competitiveness for 20 consecutive years, but China has jumped from 33rd to second place in the rankings over the same period, underscoring the threat it poses.
    

        German authorities have underinvested in areas such as energy, education, security, and infrastructure for years, which has weighed on national productivity and competitiveness.
    

        A key reason is a constitutional ""debt brake,"" imposed after the 2008 financial crisis, which limits the federal government's deficit to 0.35% of GDP. For comparison, the US deficit exceeded 6% last year.
    

        ""This policy is a handbrake on Germany's ability to support its economy and incongruous with policy in the rest of the world,"" Alison Savas, the investment director of Antipodes Partners, said in an emailed note.
    

        Relaxing its spending constraints would allow Germany to stimulate its economy, meet the ""pressing need"" to invest in its public infrastructure, and satisfy likely demands for greater defense spending from the Trump administration, she added.
    

        Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman wrote on Substack that Germany's ""obsession"" with controlling its debt has meant it's gone from ""role model to cautionary tale — a warning about the costs of rigid thinking.""
    

        Germany faces other challenges, including a shrinking workforce and aging population, a shortage of skilled workers, a lack of affordable childcare, and frustrating levels of bureaucracy.
    

        Its myriad issues are ""symptoms of a deeper malaise: chronically weak domestic demand,"" Koopman said in his report. The German economy ""parasitized on foreign demand to sustain its own existence,"" he continued, adding that it's been shored up for decades by other countries' consumption, investment, and spending on security and stability.
    

        The remedy might be large-scale government spending on everything from energy and defense to education, infrastructure, and technology, Koopman added.
    

        ""Cutting taxes, cutting red tape and/or or cutting costs won't be enough to cut it,"" he said, warning that if Germany fails to ramp up its spending, it ""risks becoming a 'has been' in the global economy.""

            Inflation is picking up again and President Donald Trump said this week it’s all his predecessor’s fault. But no matter who Trump blames for inflation, America’s economic mood is now souring — and Trump is getting the heat for it.
    

            The University of Michigan’s latest survey, released Friday, showed that US consumer sentiment declined in February for the second consecutive month, according to a final reading, down by a steep 10% from January. That was double the decline initially reported earlier this month.
    

            It’s a stunning about-face after American consumers and businesses grew hopeful (briefly) about the economy’s future following Trump’s election in November. The latest decline in consumer sentiment was driven by worries over Trump’s tariffs potentially jacking up prices.
    

            A new CNN poll released Thursday similarly showed pessimism on the rise because of prices: Nearly two thirds of US adults nationwide, 62%, said they feel Trump’s isn’t doing enough to address inflation. The Michigan survey showed that Americans are now fearful of higher inflation on the horizon.
    

            On the campaign trail, Trump promised to “bring down prices, starting on Day One.” Clearly, that didn’t happen. In January, consumer prices climbed at the fastest monthly pace since August 2023, increasing 0.5% from December.
    

            Joanne Hsu, the Michigan survey’s director, said in a release that the broad decline was “in large part due to fears that tariff-induced price increases are imminent.”
    

            But changes in sentiment are beginning to diverge based on political affiliation.
    

            “While sentiment fell for both Democrats and Independents, it was unchanged for Republicans, reflecting continued disagreements on the consequences of new economic policies,” she said.
    

            The Trump administration’s aggressive approach to tariffs is a key reason why attitudes about the economy are souring, according to various consumer surveys and polls.
    

            So far, the administration has implemented 10% across-the-board tariffs on all Chinese goods and announced 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, with no exceptions. It is also studying how best to apply “reciprocal tariffs” on America’s trading partners, which could come in early April. Trump is also keeping 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada on the table, as soon as next month, a move that economists say would likely stoke inflation.
    

            “The economy faces heightened uncertainty,” Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said in an essay published Thursday. “A trade policy uncertainty index by a group of Federal Reserve economists has surged past its historic peak.”
    

            All the drama around tariffs has affected Americans’ perception of prices: Expectations for inflation in the year ahead surged this month to 4.3%, according to the Michigan survey, up a full percentage point from January to the highest level since November 2023. On a call with reporters Thursday, Bostic said “we’re going to pay attention to all” measures of inflation expectations.
    

            The Federal Reserve, tasked with managing interest rates, keeps a close eye on consumer perceptions of prices because they can sometimes be self fulfilling, so if consumers expect inflation to pick up, they could modify their spending.
    

            But the Fed doesn’t have a nightmare on its hands just yet. Central bankers specifically focus on longer-run inflation expectations, which didn’t rise this month as much as the short-run expectations figure did, up to 3.5% in February from 3.2% in January. But it was higher than the figure initially reported.
    

            “These days, higher tariffs and immigration policies are often discussed and thought likely to increase prices, cool aggregate demand and possibly soften employment. From the standpoint of monetary policy, it could be appropriate to ignore or look through an increase in the price level if the impact on inflation is expected to be brief and limited,” St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said Thursday at an event in New York. “However, a different monetary policy response could be appropriate if higher inflation is sustained, or long term inflation expectations rise.”
    

            The closely watched Consumer Price Index rose 3% in January from a year earlier, the Labor Department said last week, the fastest annual pace since the summer of 2024.
    

            In an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity that aired Tuesday, Trump said “inflation is back,” blaming the latest uptick on government spending during the Biden administration. To be fair, Trump doesn’t shoulder much of the blame, since he occupied the Oval Office for less than half of the days covered by the latest inflation report.
    

            The latest episode of high inflation undoubtedly occurred on former President Joe Biden’s watch.
    

            “I had nothing to do with it,” Trump said. “These people have — have run the country. They spent money like nobody has ever spent.”
    

But inflation is now Trump’s problem.


            And some economists have pointed to the role that the government’s spending played in heating up the economy after the pandemic — trillions of dollars for Covid relief and infrastructure projects — but it wasn’t the sole reason why inflation surged. In reality, it was a combination of factors, such as pandemic shocks to supply and demand and the Russia-Ukraine war.
    

            “Pent-up demand, stimulative policies, pandemic changes in work and leisure practices, and the additional savings associated with constrained services spending all contributed to a historic surge in consumer spending on goods. The pandemic also wreaked havoc on supply conditions,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last year in his keynote address at the Kansas City Fed’s annual economics symposium.
    

            “Enter inflation,” he said.

18,2025-02-22,"The stakes of the German election on Sunday could not be higher. 
The E.U.’s biggest economy has been in recession for two years running, a gloomy outlook that looks set to worsen if Donald Trump makes good on his threat to hit Europe with tariffs. 
The “America First” agenda of the White House’s new occupant has raised more questions about Germany’s security posture than at any time since the end of the Cold War. 
And a spate of terror attacks committed by migrants have sapped public confidence in the immigration system, giving the Alternative for Germany (AfD) an opening. The German far-right now looks set to have its best election showing in the postwar era, with the AfD waiting in the wings and ready to pounce on the next government’s perceived failures.

The final polls heading into the vote suggest that Friedrich Merz, leader of the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU), will succeed the center-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz. He clearly faces significant challenges—some outside of his control and some self-inflicted.
Take the problems out of Merz’s immediate control first. The country’s economic model is in doubt, with manufacturing shaken by the end of cheap energy imports from Russia and growing competitiveness from China on the world market. These woes will only deepen if the U.S. President follows through on his tariff threats. Carmakers, the economy’s backbone, are set to be particularly affected, as Germany exports more cars to the U.S. than any other country. 
Second, the prospect of a U.S. withdrawal from European security has underscored the need for Germany to do more, faster, on defense than it has for 30 years. Three days after the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Scholz declared a Zeitenwende—turning point—promising a new era of German rearmament. But investment in the German army has been too slow in the three years since. Combat readiness has actually gone down because of the transfer of equipment to Ukraine. 
As the U.S. turns increasingly inward, Germany will need to take a central role in Europe’s defense. That will require not just money but taking difficult political decisions, such as the possible reintroduction of a form of conscription. This is a challenge Merz appears to grasp. On Friday, he said that Europe should “prepare for the possibility” that the U.S. would not defend its European allies.
Finally, there is migration, which polls show is among the top issues for voters. The public is exhausted after a series of deadly stabbings and car rammings committed by refugees and asylum seekers, most recently in Munich just 10 days before the vote. A sense that the system is broken has driven the uptick in support for the AfD, which openly embraces “remigration,” a term for mass deportations that originated among fringe white nationalists. Some of the AfD’s far-right sister parties, such as Marine Le Pen’s National Rally in France, shun the German party as too extreme because of its commitment to remigration.
But other problems have been brought on by Merz’s own actions. His rash decision to accept the support of the AfD to pass a resolution—a first for postwar Germany—has made him appear reckless and a gambler. 
The decision cost Merz trust with potential coalition partners on the center left at precisely the moment that swift negotiations to form a strong government are needed, Nils Schmid, an MP for the Social Democrats, a possible partner for the CDU, told me.
Merz’s gambit, though ham-fisted, was a recognition that rebuilding public trust around migration policy will be key to the next government’s success. The resolution, passed with AfD votes, promised performative toughness, which Merz has since admitted would be unenforceable. But enforcing the existing rules would be enough. Several recent attacks were committed by migrants whose asylum applications had been rejected and were therefore liable for deportation. 
The CDU leader also remains publicly committed to the so-called “debt brake,” a constitutional ban on deficit spending in most circumstances. It was brought in by Merz’s CDU predecessor Angela Merkel to appeal to a prudent electorate but it appears painfully inadequate in the face of Germany’s pressing need to invest in infrastructure and defence. 
Fortunately for Merz, the unprecedented security situation can be used as political cover to abandon the debt brake, at least for investment in defense. Voters will grant him the leeway to fiddle with deficit rules. Most will understand that politics as usual are not enough to address the country’s significant challenges. 
All major parties, including the CDU, have ruled out working with the AfD, so it will almost certainly be shut out of government this term. But if the next government falters, an empowered AfD would argue that Germans, having been failed by all major parties, should offer them a chance. Across Europe, from France to Austria, the cordon sanitaire preventing cooperation with the far-right is being shattered. For now, it is holding in Germany, but it may become impossible to sustain by the time of the next election. 
Those, then, are the challenges that a Chancellor Merz would face: succeed with one of the toughest hands dealt to an incoming chancellor for 30 years or risk being remembered as the leader who paved the way for the first far-right German government since 1945.

19,2025-02-22,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is closing its investigation into major non-fungible token marketplace OpenSea, the platform’s founder and CEO Devin Finzer said on social media.

The regulator issued a Wells notice against OpenSea in August 2024, indicating it was planning on pursuing an enforcement action against it. The regulator alleged the platform may have been operating as an unregistered securities marketplace.
The SEC’s move comes as the regulator is slated to vote on a deal negotiated with Coinbase to drop its lawsuit against the exchange, which is seen as a boon for the cryptocurrency industry and NFT creators.

“This is a win for everyone who is creating and building in our space. Trying to classify NFTs as securities would have been a step backward—one that misinterprets the law and slows innovation,” Finzer posted.
Reacting to Finzer’s post, Chris Akhavan, chief business officer of NFT marketplace Magic Eden, suggested it was a victory for the wider cryptocurrency space. “While we are competitors in the trenches, we share a deep belief in NFTs and what they will enable,” Akhavan wrote.
The announcement led to an uptick in activity for the native token of NFT marketplace LooksRare. The token, LOOKS, saw a surge in active addresses shortly after the announcement that represents an “approximately fivefold increase compared to the usual figures,” according to data from TheTie.

It's ""Big Monday"" in college basketball, and with a name like that, there must be a gigantic game. Luckily, the phrase holds true, as the Houston Cougars (23-4) travel to Lubbock to face the Texas Tech Red Raiders (21-6). Both teams are peaking at the right time and enter the game ranked inside the top 10. Texas Tech is one of the few teams to beat Houston, as the Red Raiders pulled off a one-point overtime victory over the Cougars on February 1.
Since the Texas Tech loss, Houston has won six consecutive games, including Saturday's 68-69 win over Iowa State. The Cougars are relentless on the defensive end and will give teams trouble in March. Speaking of the Red Raiders, Grant McCasland will have Texas Tech in the NCAA Tournament for the second consecutive season.
The winner of this game will gain a competitive advantage heading into the Big 12 Tournament, where they could face off in the championship.

What's better than a Big East showdown at the Mecca? Liam McNeeley and the UConn Huskies (18-8) head to the Garden to play RJ Luis Jr. and the No. 10 St. John's Red Storm (23-4). These two rivals squared off a few weeks ago at Gampel Pavilion. Luis scored 21 points, and his running mate, Kadary Richmond, scored 13 in St. John's impressive 68-62 victory.
UConn is the two-time defending national champions, but they haven't played up to that level all season. McNeely is one of the most talented freshmen in the country. However, the lack of leadership at the point guard position is jarring and could lead to an early exit for the Huskies from the tournament. Meanwhile, it's been a magical year for Rick Pitino at St. John's. The Hall of Fame coach will have the Red Storm in the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 2018–19.
UConn is running out of chances to improve its resume, while St. John's has its eyes set on a top-four seed. Find out how to watch a live stream of the Big East matchup below, and for more coverage, read our NCAA men's basketball March to the Madness guide.

23,2025-02-22,"Every year, die-hard fans of the RX1R II ask if Sony will answer their prayers and release the Mark III. Is it finally going to happen?

Released in November 2015, the RX1R II remains unlike anything else on the market. It has a 42-megapixel backside-illuminated sensor, a fixed 35mm f/2 lens, and a leaf shutter, and it fits inside a jacket pocket. Arguably, its closest rival is the Leica Q3, which should give you some idea of how niche a product this is, as does the $3,300 price tag.
Another factor that makes it vaguely Leica-esque is how well it has held its value on the secondhand market. It has carved out a reputation as something of a classic and regularly fetches upwards of $2,300. You'll be hard-pressed to find another 10-year-old camera that retains so much of its initial RRP.
After much hope, fans now wonder if the Mark III will come to market at all. Such a body has significant appeal to photography-focused photographers who want something clean and minimalist, and with fewer distracting video features getting in the way of a pure still-image-making experience. However, despite my recent article, these photographers seem to be few and far between. While Fujifilm has proven that it works for APS-C (albeit with some inspired marketing and aesthetic choices), Sony might not be confident that it’s worth plowing so much time and energy into a camera that doesn’t have broader appeal. When you also consider that an RX1R won’t help sell any of Sony’s lenses, it might not seem like a gamble worth taking.
Another consideration is that Sony has since created another full frame offering that is incredibly compact—the a7C range of cameras. (Notice how it’s the only Sony camera that gives buyers the option of a silver top plate.) Does Sony want to risk undermining its existing lineup?
Last month, Sony ambassador Mark Galer released a 45-minute review of the RX1R II, a strange move given that it's been almost a decade since the camera was announced. Galer is quick to assure viewers that he has no idea if a sequel is in the pipeline, but read into that what you will. He does, however, identify some of the hurdles that Sony will have to overcome if it’s to produce a camera that remains more compact than the a7C.
First, it would need a bigger battery, potentially undermining the RX1R’s slim profile. Then there’s IBIS—assuming that this is something customers want. (Personally, I don’t see the need.)

RX1R fans might not want to get too excited, however. Yes, compact cameras have had a resurgence of late, but if a casual photographer is going to drop upwards of four grand on a point-and-shoot, it’s probably going to be a Leica.
If it appears, what specs would Sony deliver? You can guarantee better autofocus with a full complement of AI-powered subject recognition. The lens would have all of the latest coatings, and we can safely assume it won’t be made by Zeiss this time around. The sensor would be at least 42 megapixels, if not 60, to justify the price.
And speaking of price, trying to achieve all of this for less than $5,000 will be a tall order, again taking us back to why such a camera might not be viable in the current market. As for the rest, I’m not sure. It doesn’t need a fully articulating screen, but these aren’t much less compact than semi-articulating screens, and Sony has plenty of them lying around, so why not? Maybe it’s time for internal storage and an app where sharing images is—god forbid—a pleasant experience. Who knows?

Quote:""You'll be hard-pressed to find another 10-year-old camera that retains so much of its initial RRP.""
My 8 year old Fuji X70 had an RRP of 699€. Just last week, I checked the used prices out of curosity. For a used X70 in good condition you have to pay 730€, slightly above the RRP.
What both cameras have in common is that they have no successor. 
PS: If the soon to be announced Fuji GFX100RF sells well, Sony might think again.
Would be more interested in a Sony RX100 upgrade
Yes!!!
I really hope they do release it. With so much interest in compact cameras with large sensors and fast fixed lenses, it's amazing Sony hasn't already done it.
You couldn't find a used Q3 for anywhere near $3,300, let alone a new one."
24,2025-02-22,"This is the third entry in a multipart series. You may be interested to read about Shockley Semiconductor and about Fairchild Semiconductor.
Robert Noyce resigned from Fairchild Semiconductor on the 25th of June in 1968. When Gordon Moore heard that Noyce was leaving, he chose to leave with him. In his resignation, Noyce stated: “I do not expect to join any company which is simply a manufacturer of semiconductors. I would rather try to find some small company which is trying to develop some product or technology which no one has yet done. To stay independent (and small) I might form a new company, after a vacation.” For Moore’s part, he felt that there was tremendous opportunity in starting a new semiconductor company, and he’d said as much to Noyce on several occasions. It would be natural for anyone to feel some trepidation when leaving a job to start a company, but this wasn’t the case for Moore and Noyce. Moore stated that, even at this early time, the culture in the Valley didn’t stigmatize failure; when failure occurred, people simply started over again with another attempt. These two men were also quite confident that they knew what it was they were doing. Memory is not unique to any one computing or calculating machine. All such machines need memory and the more the better. Moore figured that if a company came out with a standardized memory product, the market for it would be quite large. A large market would mean higher production volumes, which would then mean lower cost, and would in turn expand the market even further.
Having moved to San Francisco in 1961, Arthur Rock worked with Thomas J. Davis Jr to start the Davis & Rock venture capital firm. Rock had been instrumental in funding Fairchild and bringing the various parties together, and he coined the term venture capital. Of course, starting a semiconductor company wasn’t cheap. Arthur Rock had kept in touch with the traitorous eight, and when he heard that Moore and Noyce were going to make a new company, he immediately expressed his willingness to participate. The entire discussion about the matter between Noyce and Rock was a phone call lasting less than fifteen minutes. Rock described this call: Bob [that’s Noyce] just called me on the phone. We'd been friends for a long time. Documents? There was practically nothing. Noyce's reputation was good enough. We put out a page-and-a-half little circular, but I'd raised the money even before people saw it. In the span of about a day and a half in fifteen telephone calls, Rock had managed to raise $2.5 million (around $22.5 million in 2025 dollars) in addition to his own investment of $310,000 (of this, $10,000 was part of the founder’s investment of $1 per share, while the remainder was of the outside investments at $5 per share). Moore and Noyce contributed $245,000 each. The arrangement that Rock made gave the three founders half of the company and the outside investors the other half.
Moore and Noyce initially considered naming their new company Moore Noyce, but they decided against this. While it would humorously sound like more noise when said quickly, noise isn’t a word with good connotations in electronics. They settled, instead, on the name NM Electronics, and their new company was officially incorporated on the 18th of July in 1968. The same day, they hired Andrew Grove who’d served as the assistant director of development at Fairchild. On the 20th, they hired Leslie Vadász who’d worked in Fairchild’s R&D lab and helped in the development of the silicon gate with Federico Faggin. The company’s name was never intended to remain NM Electronics, but the group couldn’t think of anything too great. One of Noyce’s daughters suggested the name Intel as a contraction of integrated electronics, but that name was taken. Intel’s first major purchase was the name of the company at a cost of $15,000, a officially adopted before the end of the month.
Intel’s structure in these early days had Rock as Chairman, Noyce as CEO, Moore as Executive VP, Grove as director of engineering, and Vadász as the director of MOS design.
Before the company could begin operations, they needed a place to work. Over on Middlefield Road in Mountain View, Union Carbide was vacating a building. They’d really just begun that process, but a conference room was available. Intel rented it. As Intel took over the building, Moore felt the space was larger than what they really needed, but whether he was right or wrong, that wouldn’t be the case for too long. Official operations of Intel began in August of 1968.
For Intel’s first few months, the company had quite a bit of work. They needed to build a manufacturing process, figure out their product line, and hire enough people to get products made and sold. This involved them needing to build Fab1 as quickly as possible. The goal was to get things done by the end of December, and this meant that they wouldn’t be building every tool they needed. At Wescon, they actually bought some equipment right off the show floor. A few things had to be adapted to meet their needs, but most of their equipment wasn’t made by them. This wasn’t solely due to the timing constraints either. The founders of Intel had learned from their prior experiences in this industry. While a single company might be able to innovate in some areas, it wasn’t long before competitors replicated that success. Then, those competitors would also be iterating and innovating. A single company had a limited customer base, but the market as a whole was larger and innovations could come from anywhere. They wanted everyone’s expertise, so they bought what they could from whomever had the best tools. Moore worked closely with Intel’s suppliers, and he even made some investments in them personally. 
While Moore, Noyce, and Rock felt little fear at Intel, this wasn’t true for Grove. At Fairchild, Grove had been strictly R&D. He didn’t really see the rest of the company, and he’d been hired by Moore out of graduate school. At Intel, he had the chance to really see the entire company and its operations. He constantly feared that the company would go bankrupt, but perhaps as a result of that fear, he became quite focused on manufacturing. He wanted the company to be able to do the same things every day to make a uniform product successfully, affordably, and reliably. He quickly began handle much of the company’s operations. The team that was assembled to undertake these early efforts was phenomenal, and Intel met its goal completing the Fab1 setup by the 31st of December.
Before Fab1 was even completed, Noyce had visited Sharp in Japan. They spoke Tadashi Sasaki with the hope of gaining (at least some of) the company’s business for ICs. Sasaki then asked Rockwell, who did their manufacturing work, if they could give Intel some of their business, and Rockwell said no; they wanted to enforce their contract’s exclusivity. Sasaki then invested 40 million yen into his friends Yoshio Kojima’s company, Bijikon Kabushiki-gaisha (or Busicom), in Nara, Japan which gave him quite a bit of influence there, and allowed him to work on a CMOS calculator with Intel. Marcian Edward Hoff Jr (or Ted), Intel employee twelve, was the person initially tasked with this project on the Intel side of things. He worked as both an engineer and the liaison between the two companies.
In April of 1969, Intel released the 3101 SRAM. The 3101 held 64 bits of data (eight letters of sixteen digits), and sold for $99.50 (about $850 in 2025 dollars). Even at this time, the chip had far too little storage capacity to be useful as main memory (especially with its high price), but it was incredibly fast with an access time of fifty nanoseconds and it dissipated just six milliwatts per bit. With the chip’s high speed, low power draw, and small size, it was quite useful for processor registers in minicomputers and mainframes. The company had been hoping to gain a Honeywell contract with the 3101. That didn’t happen, but the chip was moderately successful. This chip was, in fact, successful enough that Intel’s work with Busicom fell on the back burner.
Busicom had initially provided Intel with a twelve chip, PMOS, decimal arithmetic design for their calculator hardware, and by June, Masatoshi Shima had refined this to seven chips. He didn’t have a full schematic, but it was something to work with. Shima then visited Intel in June with two other Busicom engineers. When Shima arrived, he was a bit dismayed. Almost no progress had been made, and he discovered that Intel had some serious expertise in hardware and memory design, but they didn’t have any serious expertise in logic design. Stan Mazor began to act as a buffer between Shima and Hoff, and over three months, there were many meetings about the design, but almost no progress.
At this time, Intel was just a memory company. They had packaging to accommodate early memories and nothing more. This limited the design of the chips to 4bit allowing the chip to fit in a 16-pin or 18-pin DIP. These restrictions were not initially given to Busicom, but Hoff knew them, and they influenced what he presented. Unknown to Intel, Sasaki had also come up with a four chip design and gave this to Busicom. With both sides now agreeing to a four chip design, it would seem that things could have progressed, but unknown to Busicom, no more progress would be made that year.
In July of 1969, Intel released the 1101. This was first MOS memory chip. The 1101 was slower than the 3101, but had a capacity of 256 bits, used silicon gates, and allowed for far higher memory densities than had previously been possible.
In December of 1969, CTC provided Intel the CPU requirements and preliminary designs for a processor they planned to use in their Datapoint 2200 terminal. Intel was then supposed to implement these in LSI. At Intel this project became the 1201, but much like the Busicom project, it wasn’t given any priority. Intel was a memory company. Frustrated, CTC turned to Texas Instruments who also failed, and CTC eventually built the processor out of discreet components.
For 1969, Intel ended the year with revenues of $565,874 and a loss for the year of $1,912,833 which meant a loss per share of $1.66. While this sounds terrible, the company had set expectations that this would more or less be the case.
Back on the Busicom project, Hoff eventually brought a proposal chip design to Shima that would use a general purpose 4bit CPU with binary logic, a ROM chip, and a RAM chip. Shima then added a 10bit static shift register for use with the printer and keyboard interface of the calculator. They improved the instruction set, the bus, and by December of 1969, Shima was able to write the functional specification. The agreement for Intel to build the chips was officially entered into on the 6th of February in 1970.
In April of 1970, Federico Faggin joined Intel after having left Fairchild. He’d previously worked with Vadász at Fairchild, and his skills, especially his having developed silicon gate technology, were well known to the executives at Intel. Their company was essentially based upon Faggin’s work. Given both Faggin’s background and Intel’s needs, his request to work on chip design was immediately accepted. Faggin now had just six months to produce working silicon from a specification, and he didn’t have anyone to help him in the endeavor. Shima returned to Intel just a few days later and was rather unhappy to discover that effectively zero further work had been done on the calculator chips. Faggin started working 12 to 16 hours each day. This was particularly hard for him given he had a month old daughter at home and a loving wife. During this time, his wife went to Italy with her sister as he couldn’t be around to help. I am sure that Faggin somewhat enjoyed the work, but the hours, the pace, the separation from his family, and the deadline were probably dreadful. Adding to this, when Faggin reviewed the specification, he thought it to be a poor design. There was much that he wished to change, but he didn’t have the time. More over, when he asked questions, he was told that this was his project and he simply needed to figure it out. He verified that the architecture was free of errors, but otherwise didn’t change it. He had too much to do. There was still logic design to be done, circuit design, layout, cutting, masking, initial fabrication, testing, fixing any problems found in testing, and then the tasks related to production.
In October of 1970, Intel changed the industry forever with the introduction of 1103. This was the world’s first commercially available DRAM IC and it had a capacity of 1 kilobit in an 18-pin DIP. The 1103 was used heavily throughout the industry showing up in the HP 9800 series, the PDP-11, and many more systems. Less than two years after introduction, the 1103 became the best selling memory IC in the world for its time.
In December of 1970, the Busicom chips came back for testing. None of them worked. Faggin began checking them with a microscope, and he realized that one of the masks hadn’t been applied. He noted this, and requested another run of chips be made. Those came back three weeks later. In January of 1971, Federico Faggin completed testing of the first single-chip microprocessor ever made. It was his second self-designed computer, but this one was built with multiple technologies he had pioneered. He was just 29 years old. The four chips he created were the 4001, 4002, 4003, and the 4004. The 4001 was a ROM of 256 bytes with a built-in 4bit I/O port. The 4002 was a RAM chip of 40 bytes, which would, in this case, hold 80 4bit words. The 4003 was a 10bit shift register, and in the system for which this chip was designed, it would handle the keyboard and printer. The Intel 4004 was a 4bit microprocessor that ran at 750kHz. It was built of 2300 transistors on a 10 micron process and packaged in a 16-pin DIP. It used 8bit instructions, had 4bit data words, and 12bit addressing. This rather unusual arrangement meant that the 4004 could address 4120 bits of RAM which would mean 1280 4bit characters. It could address 32768 bits of ROM which would mean 4096 8bit words. The 4004 had 46 instructions and 16 registers.
Intel’s revenues for 1970 were $3,932,517 but the company posted another loss (though far smaller) of $969,915 which meant a loss of $0.69 per share.
1971 was a big year. The Intel employee head count hit 460, the 4004 became available, the 1103 was selling well, and the company released the 1601 in January. The 1601 was the first commercially available PROM built on P-channel silicon gate MOS. The company also began selling fully assembled circuit boards populated with memory chips for mainframes and minicomputers. Intel completed the build out a new headquarters of 78,000 square feet in Santa Clara providing them about three times the space they had previously. This, naturally, allowed them to dramatically increase production. Unlike the previous location, the Santa Clara location had chemical and solvent disposal systems in place from day one preventing this from later becoming a superfund site. In September, Intel released the first EPROM, the 1701. This was an improvement over the 1601 in that it could be reprogrammed. The package had a black plastic cover over the chip. With that cover removed, shining ultra violet light on the chip would erase it and allow it to be programmed again. All of these factors combined allowed Intel to post its first profit at $1,015,080 on revenues of $9,411,821. Share holders saw $0.17 earned on each share.
The release of the Intel 4004 caught the attention of Daniel Alroy who’d just started the Q1 Corporation with the dream of building a microcomputer. The 4004 was proof to him that his idea was possible, but the 4004 wasn’t sufficient for his tasks. As his previous employer had funded CTC at his suggestion, he knew that Intel had worked on an 8bit CPU, and he met with Noyce to urge him to produce that CPU. He pledged to be the first buyer, but Noyce said that CTC would need to release the Datapoint 2200 CPU design to Intel. Alroy then spoke with CTC President, Phil Ray. Ray agreed.
Of course, Intel now had Faggin. Immediately after wrapping up the 4004, he was tasked with bringing this new 8bit design into the world, and essentially all of the problems from the 4004 project were present. The design wasn’t great, he had very little time, and he had very little staff. The 1201 became the Intel 8008 which was made available commercially in April of 1972. The 8008 was an 8 bit CPU with a 14 bit address width. It was manufactured on a 10 micron process and built of 3500 transistors. It was packaged in an 18-pin DIP, which resulted in 30 TTL chips being required to interface memory and I/O. This packaging was dictated by Grove and Vadász despite protest against it and meant that the chip did not perform as well as it could have otherwise. The 8008 could achieve around 29,000 operations per second. True to his word, Alroy bought a bunch of 8008s and delivered the world’s first complete, pre-assembled, commercially produced, microcomputer system to the Litcom Division of Litton Industries on Long Island on the 11th of December in 1972.
1972 was a huge year. The release of the 8008 brought microcomputers to the world, the memory business was booming, and Intel began expanding to Livermore with Fab3, and to Penang, Malaysia with a site dedicated initially to assembly, but later growing to handle test, design, development, sales, services, and marketing for the region. Intel acquired Microma on the 14th of July in 1972 for $15 million. Microma was a local Mountain View company that built digital watches with LCD displays. Over the next six years, this acquisition would prove to have been a mistake, one that Moore called my $15 million mistake, and saw him wearing an Intel-Microma watch for many years to remind him of his error. While it may indeed have been a mistake, Intel did some amazing engineering with the Microma. In particular, Intel made the first SOC, the 5810, in 1974 for use in a Microma watch. It included all of the timing functions and the LCD controller, and it was built with CMOS. Despite this pioneering work, in September of 1977, Intel announced that it would be selling Microma. The company went to ASUAG. Intel closed 1972 with 1002 employees, $22,970,729 in revenues and $3,083,600 in profit which provided $1.11 per share.
In June of 1973, Intel introduced the Intellec 4 and the Intellec 8 microcomputers at the National Computer Conference in the New York Coliseum. These were sold to software and hardware developers in limited numbers. For the Intellec 8, the price started at $2395. These machines had resident monitors in ROM and they had a PL/M compiler (also a new product). The Intellec series supported a teletype at 110 baud, paper tape, and glass teletypes at 1200 baud. The Intellec 4 shipped with 1K RAM and could support up to 4K instruction RAM. Data memory was just 320 4bit words, and could be expanded to 2560 words. The 8, on the other hand, shipped with 5K RAM and could support up to 16K. These machines were offered either as boards or as fully assembled rack-mountable units with front panel and power supply. The fully assembled systems weighed in at 31 pounds.
Shortly after the release of the 8008, Federico Faggin began pushing for a new general purpose processor that wouldn’t have the same limitations as the 8008. Intel had developed a new N-channel MOS process for 4K DRAM, and this is what Faggin wanted to use. He also wanted a new bus architecture, a new interrupt structure, more instructions, and a 40-pin DIP; all while keeping the chip source-code compatible with the 8008. He wanted the instruction cycle time to be 2 microseconds which would put the product within the realm occupied by minicomputers. Approval took time but once he had it, Faggin hired Masatoshi Shima to help with logic design and firmware. 
Throughout 1973, the company introduced various memory chips, support chips for memories and processors, and even an LCD driver. Revenues for the year were $65,593,000 and profit was $9,214,000 or $2.12 per share.
The improved CPU that Faggin had been working on saw life in April of 1974 as the Intel 8080. The first 8080 CPUs were built of 4500 transistors (later models bumped that to 6000) on a 6 micron process, and they came in a 40-pin DIP. The 8080 could operate at 2MHz to 3.125MHz. Every instruction that the 8008 had, had an equivalent on the 8080, and the 8080 thereby maintained source compatibility with the 8008. While the 8080 had an 8bit data bus, it did have a 16bit address bus and a few 16bit operations. Maximum RAM support for the 8080 was 64K, and the chip could achieve 290,000 operations per second. The Intel 8080 was the breakthrough microprocessor. This humble little processor powered the S100 bus machines, many of the early microcomputers, gave rise to CP/M, Altair BASIC, and so many more products and innovations that paved the way for the industry today. A major part of its success was the need for fewer support chips which helped lower the cost. Of the 8080, Faggin stated: “The 4004 and 8008 suggested it, but the 8080 made it real.”
Despite the launch of one of the most important technological products in the history of the computing industry, 1974 wasn’t the best year for Intel or the broader US economy. The US entered a particularly brutal recession as a result of the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, the war in Vietnam, the 1973 oil crisis, and a market crash. The company’s profits did climb, but this was largely due to the first half of the year. On the 5th of April, the first quarter’s results were out and the company was far exceeding the first quarter of the prior year; $6.6 million versus $893,000. In the second two quarters of the year, demand fell while Intel’s supply had risen with its expansions. This forced a layoff of about 30% of Intel’s total workforce. For Federico Faggin, watching coworkers lose their jobs, fighting tooth and nail to develop products that became highly successful, and never receiving proper acknowledgement for his achievements and contributions were all just too much. He voluntarily left Intel on the 31st of October in 1974. On the 1st of November, he started Zilog.
Despite a rough second half of the year, Intel still faced little danger. All of their debts had been paid, they owned their facilities with no mortgages, they owned all of their production equipment, and they required no equity financing having nearly $2 million in cash. In December of 1974, the company announced that Gordon Moore would become president and CEO, Robert Noyce would become chairman of the board, Arthur Rock would become vice chairman, Ed Gelbach would become senior vice president and general manager of the components division, Jack Carsten the vice president of marketing, Gene Flath the vice president of manufacturing, Les Vadász the vice president of engineering, and finally, Andrew Grove would become executive vice president. The company had grown and the restructuring was necessary, and it positioned Intel quite well for the changes and challenges yet to come.

The Trump administration is planning to lay off at least 40% of the Federal Housing Administration’s (FHA) workers, according to a Bloomberg report. 
The FHA is just the latest target of the Trump administration’s  Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
The FHA provides mortgage insurance on loans for people who otherwise wouldn’t qualify for one because of low credit scores or insufficient income. The cuts could have ripple effects for homebuyers hoping to jump into an already soft real estate market, according to experts.

28,2025-02-22,"The microgravity of the ISS allows for unique science experiments.
Elon Musk called this week for the deorbiting of the International Space Station (ISS) ""as soon as possible.""
""It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the [ISS],"" Musk wrote in a post on X on Thursday. ""It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.""
In a follow-up post, Musk said he was planning to recommend to President Donald Trump that the station be brought down ""as soon as possible"" and that the 2030 timeline for deorbiting be moved up to two years from now.
Space experts told ABC News the ISS is very important in conducting scientific research, developing technologies, promoting STEM education and fostering diplomatic relationships. Deorbiting the station prematurely could end important innovations and studies pertaining to future space missions.
""It is just giving us great data on living and working in space, longitudinally, which will apply directly to our plans to return to the moon and then go on to Mars,"" Jordan Bimm, space historian and professor of science communication at the University of Chicago, told ABC News. ""So, it has a diplomatic purpose. It has an experiential purpose, and then obviously, it has these scientific and technological development purposes as well.""
""It'd be a shame to cut this short for a non-technical reason, but for rather sort of political reason,"" he added.
In the 24 years that the ISS has been in orbit, there have been more than 4,000 experiments conducted, according to NASA.
Research is conducted across several disciplines, including biology, earth sciences, human health and physical science, the federal space agency said.
The microgravity of space allows experiments to be performed in a way that is unable to be replicated on Earth due to the planet's gravity.
Bimm said he believes one of the most important findings to come out of ISS research is how living and working in microgravity for extended periods of time affects the human body.
""We have found by studying astronauts living and working, by doing self-experiments on the scientists and astronauts on board, that microgravity affects the body in lots of deleterious ways,"" he said. ""That leads to your bone loss, muscle loss, changes in the fluid inside our bodies that are normally being pulled down by Earth's gravity, changes to the eye and vision loss and things like that.""
He went on, ""We have gotten good data on how that progresses over time, and importantly, we have developed countermeasures for these things as well, including resistance training or running on a treadmill, things like that that we wouldn't have without the ISS, without this platform where humans can spend long periods of time consistently and be studied In a scientific setting.""
He said continuing to study this will be important for future space missions, including future moon missions under the Artemis program and eventual missions to Mars.
David Alexander, director of the Rice Space Institute at Rice University in Houston, told ABC News there has also been the development of technologies and materials on the ISS that would benefit not only long-term space missions but life on Earth.
This field, called space manufacturing, includes DNA sequencing, developing new water purification systems and even drug development.
""The unique environment of space allows us to perhaps develop pure pharmaceuticals. People have been working on creating high-purity fiber optic cables that would speed up communications here on Earth,"" he said. ""In space manufacturing, some of it will be for use in space but some of it is the market is here on the ground, to take those technologies and bring them to bear on, that affect our daily lives here on planet Earth.""
The ISS also participates in education programs that help students learn about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
This includes providing students the opportunity to speak directly with crew members living and working aboard the ISS via amateur radio, participating in virtual missions, learning space experiments that can be done at home and challenging students to design experiments that solve space exploration problems with DNA analysis.
""Astronauts will frequently do teleconferences with classrooms, Q and As,"" Bimm said. ""Having a terrestrial scientist come into your class, communicating with astronauts on orbit in the ISS imprints on the minds of young people in such a powerful way that this is another one of these like superpowers that we would lose if we lost the ISS.""
Alexander said NASA and the ISS work to communicate with adults as well, with the Rice Space Institute hosting a recent conversation between Olympic athletes and astronauts on the ISS.
He said the conversation encompassed topics such as work ethic, human performance, parallels between space and sports and the importance of international collaboration.
""I think it's really, really important and, of course, that's why NASA, in particular, spends a huge amount of time in allowing their astronauts to be accessible to the general public,"" he said.
The ISS is maintained by five space agencies and their contractors including NASA, the Canadian Space Agency, the European Space Agency, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and Roscosmos in Russia.
In the 1990s, the U.S. proposed combining the American and Russian space programs following the collapse of the Soviet Union, and stalling on individual projects, to build the new space station.
""We can definitely talk about all the different science and technology development that's happening there, but it also serves a diplomatic purpose bringing together different nations in space for such a long-term project,"" Bimm said. ""It really did represent this like post-Cold War moment where the U.S. and Russia and international partners could cooperate in space.""
NASA says the ISS has been visited by astronauts from 18 different countries to collaborate in space, helping in the construction, assembly and operation of the ISS.
Every partner country manages and runs the hardware it provides to the ISS, according to NASA.
""That allowed us to foster much stronger partnerships with countries around the world and thinking about space technology development and space exploration,"" Alexander said.

The SNL 50th anniversary show is starting to show COVID symptoms -> https://archive.ph/EErFA
https://www.avclub.com/snl50-martin-short-covid-flu-quademic-joke
A couple of years ago, when Janet retired as a nurse after 45 years, I began an almost-daily refrain:
> I’m So Glad You’re Out!
A lot of friends-of-friends have gone through SNL. I switched professions after two knee surgeries in medieval times. Theater and film were last bastions of masking and testing and dammit, now we’re here. You are only entertainment elite if you show your face. Put yourself in place of those people, not just emotional attachment, not just peer pressure, but your agent up your back with a percentage in mind. So hard to resist, “Where’s Hader” when Hader has a history of wise choices…
If you can find a clean clip, check Jost’s face after the joke. He flashes his teeth, but then his top lip goes straight. They knew.
As Brit/Aussie SNL was never “a thing” for me. I now only see segments via YT. I got into it via Norm MacDonald and his unrelenting pursuit of *ahem* certain people. He got fired for this. However, I, though I loved his totally “on the nose” style on SNL, adored his ability to string out a really “dad” joke into a 5 minute monologue on late night talk shows (like this ) (some of which he was brought in at the last minute when the “official” guest dropped out suddenly) bringing in things like obscure Russian literature really made me doubly appreciative of him.
The definition of a man who disguised his utter genius under the persona of the “everyman”. Plus he made the joke that you do NOT lose a battle with cancer…..at worst it is a draw (tie) since if you die, the cancer dies too. And he made that joke at a time when he undoubtedly knew he was terminally ill with cancer. Which he told nobody about except a very small circle of friends and family because he he never wanted sympathy. A truly great man.
During the Communist era, we could fly our relatives from Prague to the USA for a visit on our Dime, and it was always a hostage situation in that aunt Jarmila could come-but her husband couldn’t. Kind of a perfect anti-defect defense.
She visited sometime in the late 70’s and SNL was by far the coolest thing on the tube and was must-see TV, especially for teenagers the likes of me.
So the whole family is watching, and Jarmila had ok English-barely adequate @ best, and Czech speakers learning to speak English have this halting pattern of speech, and on come the Festrunk brothers looking for foxes!
I think Dan and Steve spoke pidgin Czech perhaps, and it was hilarious-but not to Jarmila who was mortified by the skit, yelling at the top of her lungs ‘They/ are /NOT/ Czech!’ before we were able to calm her down and explain what went on without the help of a replay button, very much lost in translation.
Working link for “WHY SHOULD WE CARE IF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, AND MUSK’S DOGE, ARE ACTING UNCONSTITUTIONALLY?” article at-
https://www.crisesnotes.com/why-should-we-care-if-the-trump-administration-and-musks-doge-are-acting-unconstitutionally/
Some Presidents act as if the Constitution is just an optional extra. George Bush once shouted ‘Stop throwing the Constitution in my face. It’s just a goddamned piece of paper!’ And look how well his Presidency worked out for the rule of law.
I’m sorry,
 You are going to have to be more specific than that. Which George Bush?
 Was it the guy who was the criminal banker and cia chief who was also part of the savings and loan scandal decades and Iran contra., and war on drugs.(supplying the drugs and  monetizing it with the crime bills and corrections industrial complex).. or
 was it the other george bush  who  oversaw the cover up of 9/11 and started the war on terror, and the war on freedom, and invaded  Iraq under false pretenses..,torture,dark sites,etc.
 I mean if you are just saying george bush was no friend of the truth, or the US…. you’re just gonna have to be more specific.
To be clear, Bush or Shrub?
Yes.
The later, who I call the Frat Boy President. The guy who got into elite universities, even though he was only a C student – and joked about it when President. The one who joined the Air National Guard to defend the skies of Texas against the Vietnamese Air Force. The guy who one day wandered off his base and never returned to finish his military service. And people say that Trump is not qualified to be President.
Joe Biden would be another with Executive Orders that were struck down by the SC in several instances. Then there were his radical moves in the healthcare area such as the “vaccine” mandates.
The press cheered these Biden moves while being horrified by Trump’s return serve in the battle of the bigshots. I have a theory that what is really going on is a civil war among the elites and that Trump/Musk are out to get their establishment rivals, not ordinary people who were sidelined politically (and therefore mostly irrelevant to big power) some time ago.
In other words not for nothing did Biden issue all those pardons as he walked out the door. It’s likely there are many skeletons in many closets. Bondi has even said she will release Epstein’s client list.
>>>Bondi has even said she will release Epstein’s client list.
Really?  I need to keep some popcorn ready for that.🍿
“Stop throwing the Constitution in my face. It’s just a goddamned piece of paper!”
Later denied by those allegedly in attendance. There are no lasting citations. In this “modern” world of deceit, and the power of the word,  nothing is to be believed or trusted at face value and little upon extensive research.
What’s interesting about all this, whatever justifications that the Trump administration might utter, the truth is as Trump said recently. He’s saving the country and whatever he does is legal. That is the real justification for this. The truth is, going to the courts to “stop” all this isn’t going to yield any satisfaction. The executive has both the actual money printing apparatus and the state security services.
Which court exactly is gonna stop them?
This is already game over.
The Constitutional always relies on a broad agreement that it is legitimate as widely understood. Trump and his people understand it differently. And that’s how it is, going forward. For all practical purposes, unless someone with greater force disabuses Trump of his notions, then here we are. No court rulings are gonna change that if they aren’t voluntarily respected.
A general strike and widespread social disobedience might, but I don’t expect that is gonna happen. And the politicians with at least access to megaphones to promote this, the liberal Democrats, are squirming at criticism that they aren’t doing anything. So no help at all from those quarters. And what constitutes the Left in this country is mostly the woke left, the crowd that left workers to get disabled and die from the ongoing Pandemic, to perpetuate brunch. So no help there.
This year is gonna be scorched!
The courts stopped the New Deal, no? (Not saying the New Deal and DOGE are equal, but they are driven by similar justifications and a lot of people were not unjustly suspicious of FDR back then, too.)
“The courts stopped the New Deal, no?”
Along with the election of Franklin Roosevelt, very large majorities of Democrats were elected in the Senate and House.  There were Democratic southern conservatives elected to Congress, but they very largely supported Roosevelt New Deal policies.  New Deal policies were sent to Congress and approved and implemented for a time before several important policies were set aside by the Supreme Court.
Roosevelt strictly adhered to Constitutional dictates.  When Roosevelt would come to talk about the possibility of changing the number of Supreme Court Justices, that was entirely provided for by the Constitution.  The number of Justices was changed by Congress several times before Roosevelt thought about the possibility.
The point is Roosevelt strictly abided by the Constitution.

The ‘Hundred Days’ of F.D.R.
By ARTHUR SCHLESINGER Jr.
Exactly half a century ago, the Republic plunged into the Hundred Days – that time of tumultuous change when a flood of legislation swept away venerable market practices and gave the American economic system a new contour.
In the frenzied weeks from March to June 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt sent 15 messages to Congress and steered 15 major laws to enactment: among them, central planning for industry and for agriculture, new regulation for banking and for the securities exchanges, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Civilian Conservation Corps and a national system of unemployment relief.
”At the end of February,” Walter Lippmann wrote when the special session adjourned, ”we were a congeries of disorderly panic stricken mobs and factions. In the hundred days from March to June we became again an organized nation confident of our power to provide for our own security and to control our own destiny.”
The Hundred Days were only the start of a process that ended by transforming American society. Who can now imagine a day when America offered no Social Security, no unemployment compensation, no food stamps, no Federal guarantee of bank deposits, no Federal supervision of the stock market, no Federal protection for collective bargaining, no Federal standards for wages and hours, no Federal support for farm prices or rural electrification, no Federal refinancing for farm and home mortgages, no Federal commitment to high employment or to equal opportunity – in short, no Federal responsibility for Americans who found themselves, through no fault of their own, in economic or social distress?
These social changes have won general approval. Even the Reagan counterrevolution, for all its 19th-century laissez-faire and Social Darwinist passions, shrinks from abolishing the framework of social protection – the ”safety nets” – created by the New Deal.
But what of the narrowly economic results? How effective was the New Deal in reducing unemployment, promoting economic growth and altering the distribution of income? And does the experience of half a century ago offer any guidance to the nation in its economic perplexities today?
The technique of the New Deal was improvisation and experiment. ”It is common sense to take a method and try it,” F.D.R. said in the 1932 campaign: ”If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.”
Except for that part about admitting failure frankly, this continued to be the rule for Roosevelt’s 12 years in the White House. In the intellectual circumstances of the time, there was really no alternative to experiment. The Hundred Days found the country in a state of invincible ignorance. No one knew the causes of the Depression. No one knew the cure. Business leaders and academic economists alike were analytically baffled and impotent…

I love this, and if America is currently a sinking ship, that’s the name of the boat.
From the “Amazon Buys the Bond Franchise” article…
SpaceX rocket debris crashes into Poland
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62z3vxjplpo
Polsa has confirmed that “an uncontrolled re-entry of the Falcon 9 rocket’s second stage occurred between 04:46 and 04:48 on February 19, 2025, over Poland”.
…and this is the company that got the contract to de-orbit the ISS safely, so that Musk can eventually sell a replacement to the US et al.
Maybe Amazon can do a remake of Moonraker with a 3D recreation of Roger Moore and … 
In the original film, Bond investigates the vanishing of a Space Shuttle, leading him to Hugo Drax, the owner of the shuttle’s manufacturing firm. Along with astronaut Dr. Holly Goodhead, Bond follows the mystery from California to Venice, Rio de Janeiro, the Amazon rainforest, and finally into outer space to prevent a plot to wipe out the world population and repopulate humanity with a master race.
…it’s pretty clear who gets cast as Hugo Drax.
I’m going to start referring to Elon as Drax. 
And BTW, it’s so, so sweet to have comments back. If the pause was a way to scuttle some trolls I’m happy it worked!
Special 007 bonus: now we get to find out whether Goldfinger got all of the gold in Fort Knox.
…didn’t Goldfinger want to nuke Fort Knox?
Yes. **Spoiler alert** His cunning plan was to irradiate all the gold in Fort Knox in order to drive up the value of his own hoard. I like the part when Bond finally opens the nuclear bomb, and sees Goldfinger’s crazy DIY Rube Goldberg machine inside…
Could be interesting if Musk gets an audit and it’s all just tungsten. Goldfinger jokes will abound.
Isn’t tungsten more valuable than gold, especially since 80-90% of global supply is outside the West’s control now? (Sarcasm, but semi-serious)
Tungsten is even more valuable if it has a thin layer of gold over it. /sarc

The most underreported and important story in AI right now is that pure scaling has failed to produce AGI
Jeebus. No sh*t. It’s just mind boggling that anybody ever thought this would produce AGI. See Hubert Dreyfus, Rodney Brooks, et al.
Did people really expect that? Don’t the techbros know not to get high off their own supply? And given Deepseek’s achievements, if anyone is even remotely close to AGI, it’s probably the Chinese (even so, not likely).
The emperor paid his tailors vast sums of gold because they promised to make him the most wonderful clothes ever, clothes only the ‘right people’ could see.  / ahem.
There’s a clip of Sapolsky saying the only difference between chimps & humans is we have less olfaction and two extra rounds of brain cell development. So there’s been some cross-disciplinary support for the idea of scaling.
Ah well, nevertheless.
What Separates Us from Chimps? As It Turns Out, Not Much
“Cross-disciplinary support”
Still sounds like comparing apples and oranges – so to speak – putting AI in the camp with chimps and humans.
I know.  Gives new meaning to the old joke definition of PhD: Piled higher and Deeper. / ;)
They should go back to concentrating on achieving full autonomous driving. Or getting gold from lead.
They are more likely to get gold from lead than from Fort Knox.

On T Cells and COVID. You know you can get you T Cell Levels tested by your Primary Care Doc? I just had mine done because I was having some weird skin, lung and fatigue issues  (unrelated to COVID since I has been happening all my life, possible partial immune deficiency).
The test is labeled as “LYMPH MARKER LIMITED,FLOW”. My CD3 T Cell percent came in at 61%, the very low limit of low. It seems like my T Cells are not maturing well. I am getting a Blood Smear test this week.
Almost every time I go to a doc they take my labs and want to test me for AIDS even though I tell them I am at zero risk for it and I test negative every time. HIV deplete T Cells as well, which is why my Doc was smart to check for me. She is also ordering a serum zinc test since she said that seems to increase T Cells.
New you can use!
I feel compelled to add some nuance here.
The first thing I would say is who am I to criticize another MD who is doing their very best to diagnose, quantify or treat Long COVID, or more commonly in my experience Long Vaccine?  We have been left to our own devices.  To my knowledge there has not been any diagnostic strategy, or recommended treatment algorithms published by any of our agencies or big medical centers.  During the days of AIDS, these types of things were out and debated by everyone all during the time of that pandemic when we did not know what was going on.  So, I myself feel at times that I am just pulling at straws, doing my best to help the person in front of me.  It must be noted that we must be very careful.  Private practice MD groups are not big research centers.  In big academic centers doing research, procedures like the above test are usually paid for by the research.  Not so in regular care – and the patient could be stuck with huge, and I mean huge, bills.  Especially if the insurance company finds the coding inadequate to cover the lab on the diagnosis.  A simple search on our system here reveals that the above test is about 5000 dollars.
I have ordered these myself very rarely on a very specific type of patient.  The oncologists order them much more frequently.  A “Limited Flow Lymph Marker” test is used when a patient has lymphedema – swelling caused by lymphatic obstruction.  It is a QUANTITATIVE ONLY test to tell the relative levels of CD cells and other types of immune cells in the patient’s blood. The ratio of the various dozens of these markers can tell us what is likely the underlying cause of the lymphedema.  This is a different type of exam than immunophenotyping which is also QUANTITATIVE ONLY – and that is used for example in AIDS to follow the CD4 counts.  None of these things are QUALITATIVE – in other words none of them are able to tell immune damage or dysfunction in the cells themselves.  That takes a very dedicated lab and dedicated scientists.  This is what Dr Leonardi is describing and I assume he works in some such lab.  Regular physicians can only dream of ordering such items.  I have several patients with the resources to pay for this kind of study on their own blood, and it has been at times very illuminating, but I will not even share the cost they paid – it is so staggering.
As I have said a few other times, this entire problem has so far been ignored largely by the movers of the profession.  We have no diagnostic criteria, no recommended tests, and certainly no treatment.  I have myself repeatedly seen elevated ESR, elevated CRP, and elevated D-Dimers in these patients,  Often they have elevated liver function tests.  This is often years after vaccination.  In the absence of any guidance, we are trying our best to come up with things that help.  That is where we are today.
As I have said a few other times, this entire problem has so far been ignored largely by the movers of the profession. We have no diagnostic criteria, no recommended tests, and certainly no treatment.
Thank you for this, for it is the truth.
Just for clarification. my doctor had a reason for ordering this test and it was covered by Medicare. I am disabled now for 30 years and have a consistently low WBC (~3-3.5). She is the first on to care about this and wanted to rule out Leukemia, which it look like might be the case, which is the reason she order the smear. Also My CD4 and CD8 were both low but the ratio was fine signalling a possible immune deficiency and not a viral problem (In HIV only CD4 is low). Again, this something I have lived with since I was a child. (To note the severity of my issues I also had an ADA and PNP enzyme assay which showed slightly elevated DeoxyAXP and low normal ADA activity which was again to investigate a possible immune deficiency, which seems like is there but only partial.) So, you see, I am not an ordinary patient, but my insights of my own health issues may benefit others. The Limited Flow Lymph Marker is useful in HIV infection as well and the CD4:CD8 ration is a common test for people with HIV.
At least I would like to see more T Cells testing in people with Long COVID, at least to rule it in or out.
> certainly no treatment.
> but my insights of my own health issues may benefit others.
Thank you for this.
Janet and I considered buying the materials for testing CD4 & CD8. Two main reasons we didn’t:
 : So now you get to tell someone they’ve Acquired an Immune Deficiency. Yay.
 : So What? Once someone knows, what do they do?
This last is a subset of Broken News. I’ve spent some available time reviewing my notes, and it’s usually not fruitful, as the consequences and implications have been incorporated in practice. We don’t worry so much about flu because our Covid precautions cover it. But vitamins and herbs and other interventions we do can seem inadequate against systemic unknowns.
When someone takes us on a journey through their landscape, whether burnt trees or our health care capacities, it helps me frame an uncertain environment. So again, thanks.
You’re welcome.
I consider myself a citizen scientist so that is why I do all of this. Most of the time I do not care and just live in the forests and mind my own business. But since my family has the same issues as well I thought I could help them too. I think there are some things that help me for sure and this was proven by an increased WBC count. Keeping down my stress is important.
I often wonder what has happened to discusion about the aftereffects of the “vaccine.”
Several months after I had the first two vaccines, I came down with polymyalgia rheumatica. After that was diagnosed and I was seeing a rheumatologist, he mentioned that he had been seeing many such cases after the vaccine. He spoke quickly and I didn’t follow up on the point.
And after the polymyalgia, my hips went south, so to say. That might have been due to the prednisone I had been taking, but nevertheless, I ended up with both hips being replaced. Might that have been because of the vaccine, or did the vaccine simply lead to the other factors? I’ve no idea, but I’ve been avoiding covine vaccines (and any indoor gathering of people) ever since.
Are you able to provide evidence for the existence of so called “Long Vaccine”? And are you able to refute evidence that the vaccines have reduced incidence of Long COVID among the vaccinated? Or are you claiming that both Long COVID and Long Vaccine exist in tandem? Damned if I do, damned if I don’t?
For example, can.you counter Dr. Al-Aly’s study, among others, that demonstrates both lower rates of Long COVID among the vaccinated and higher post-COVID chances of developing metabolic and gastrointestinal disorders, including diabetes and dyslipidemia, among the unvaccinated?

Yale Researchers Find COVID Spike Protein in Blood 709 Days After Vaccination, Positing Millions of Long COVID Patients May Actually Be Vaccine Injured
NIH has poured $1.6 billion into Long COVID research, but little or nothing to study vaccine harms, causing patient advocates to hide vaccine injury.
https://disinformationchronicle.substack.com/p/yale-researchers-find-covid-spike
The tone of the Yale University press release itself is very restrained. “Immune markers of post vaccination syndrome indicate future research directions. A small number of people report chronic symptoms after receiving COVID-19 shots. A new study provides clues for further research.”
https://news.yale.edu/2025/02/19/immune-markers-post-vaccination-syndrome-indicate-future-research-directions
Unfortunately, because of some of the worst malfiesence of my lifetime as a physician, the Pharma companies were allowed to get away with profound and severe breaches in protocol regarding these products.  As an IRB member for years, I have never seen anything like this.  The FDA and other authorities just let them do it “because”.  Accordingly, the best source of data for answers like this is now completely obliterated. You just do not release the control or placebo groups in any study.  The study you cite above is backward looking, and because of the very nature of how they are looking at the information is so wildly confounded as to be pretty much worthless.  There may be many other issues involved in, for example, why they have a higher incidence of diabetes.  Please recall, truly unvaccinated status was very common in the Black and Hispanic communities – and they are much more commonly going to have diabetes.  This confounding is the problem with all of these things now because the authorities let these companies break the control group.  
So, as a physician, with thousands under my care, I have to revert back to my training and how to assess what is going on in front of me.  So far, there has been basically zero help from any kind of agencies doing really well done studies.  And so far, they have completely censored much of the actual granular data – so I must do what I was trained to do long ago and do the best I can for my patients.  
I have kept complete and thorough records.  Unlike the EMR systems the agencies use to document vaccine status in clinical trials, deeply flawed, I investigate everyone’s immunization status thoroughly.  This is especially true of the hundred or so “Long COVID” patients in my care.  I have not done it lately – but a quick EMR search the way the research trials do it without abstractors revealed a few months ago that 54% of these patients were “unvaccinated”.  However, on my own personal records – every last one of them has been vaccinated at least twice.  So, there is that huge glaring problem that has never been dealt with.  Many of these patients have also been COVID infected – so it is very difficult to know what to make of any of this.
I will repeat again, there are no diagnostic criteria, there are no algorithms, and there is no treatment advice.  But the problem is very very real.
Thanks for this, the lack of criteria is frustrating and leads to a lot of confusion south here about this, in terms of whether it’s a unique entity and how to differentiate it.
This is something we could really use more research on, especially regarding management.
‘The FDA and other authorities just let them do it “because”. ‘
Not so much “because” as this was a politically expedient “solution” to the Pandemic. These vaccines were going to be the silver bullet that would make people think that the Government and Big Pharma together were going to save people and if anybody tried to say different, then they would be denigrated and de-platformed for their efforts. Who cared if they even worked or not.
Doc, I read every comment you make and have great respect for your integrity. There is treatment advice but it is coming from doctors who say they are on the front line. I believe them. Dr. Kory, Dr Hoffe who just had his charges from the CPSBC dropped for spouting “misinformation” along with Dr McCullough and many others. There does seem to be some treatments for either long Covid or what is now described as Post Vaccination Syndrome.  I’m not a doctor but all reasonable indications seem to point to the spike protein as being the culprit. I don’t understand why this question hasn’t been answered after 5 years. Dr. Gorski of SBM which is linked to here occasionally had an article a few years ago claiming that the spike protein was benign. Another article linked here recently made the claim that it was the spike protein of the virus causing these symptoms yet the genetically modified spike protein of the vaccine was ok. Hard to believe as the Nobel prize was won due to the insertion  one of ingredients to make the mRNA spike protein last longer. It has now been shown to still be present for 709 days after injection. Dr. McMillan Of Vejon  Health on YouTube has some very good videos on spike protein potential mechanisms of damage. I could go on but it seems that no one is willing to look under the carpet.
Long Covid was identified as a post-Covid effect long before the Covid vaccines were launched, so it CANNOT be solely a vaccine effect:
The name “long COVID” was created by the people experiencing it in Spring 2020 to describe their journeys of not recovering.2 Here, we offer a way to standardize its diagnosis through defining what constitutes initial infection with COVID-19.
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7992371/
A big study showed Long Covid is more prevalent among the unvaxxed than the vaxxed. ect. The study used VA data, which is the best quality data we have in the US (way better than other studies that use unreliable EHRs):
https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2403211
This was the study reference in the Yale press release mentioned above. 
The sample was extremely large: “441,583 veterans with SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 1, 2020, and January 31, 2022, and 4,748,504 controls’. The key bit from the analysis;
Among vaccinated persons, the cumulative incidence of PASC at 1 year was 5.34 events per 100 persons (95% CI, 5.10 to 5.58) during the delta era and 3.50 events per 100 persons (95% CI, 3.31 to 3.71) during the omicron era (difference between the omicron and delta eras, −1.83 events per 100 persons; 95% CI, −2.14 to −1.52). Vaccinated persons had a lower cumulative incidence of PASC at 1 year than unvaccinated persons (difference during the delta era, −4.18 events per 100 persons [95% CI, −4.47 to −3.88]; difference during the omicron era, −4.26 events per 100 persons [95% CI, −4.49 to −4.05]). Decomposition analyses showed 5.23 (95% CI, 4.97 to 5.47) fewer PASC events per 100 persons at 1 year during the omicron era than during the pre-delta and delta eras combined; 28.11% of the decrease (95% CI, 25.57 to 30.50) was attributable to era-related effects (changes in the virus and other temporal effects), and 71.89% (95% CI, 69.50 to 74.43) was attributable to vaccines.
As I read the data, it has >40,000 unvaxxed across three periods (declining unvaxxed which makes sense). 
I have to question IM Doc on this one. Recall he is in a very blue area and so his patients would skew to vaxxed. The VA data, which in not tainted with the EHR issues (not picking up vaccinations say at pharmacies, VA members have strong financial incentives to get all treatments at the VA) indicate it is incorrect to depict it as only or mainly a vaccine eff
This is an FYI – and an example.  There are so many on x and other social media at this point who are posting their entire medical records with regard to their long-vaccine issues.  A BIG CAVEAT – I look sideways at anything and everything I see on social media, there is so much AI and fake going on it is hard to wade through it all.  But as a physician, I can look at these reports and am able to determine better than someone who is untrained if these look genuine.  And they most certainly do appear to be real.
https://x.com/HouseLyndseyRN/status/1893081833530892582
This is one of the most comprehensive I have seen.  It appears to be genuine.  It would be very difficult for anyone to fake this.  There are many things in extensive reports like this that would be mutually exclusive, etc.  Something on page 1 matches up with the other item on page 3 perfectly, etc.  If it is a fake, it is a good one.
This person has very elevated spike protein levels.  This person at least according to the last date done has never been infected with COVID.  This report has both quantitative and qualitative parameters.  She appears to have a very damaged immune system in many respects.
This is exactly what I see when I have patients who have resources that can pay for this.  These pages are I would guess up to 100,000 dollars – likely more.  These numbers are very consistent with what I have seen in others.  
I spent some time digging up what I would consider the best one on X.  There are others, but I am not going to bore you.  I have no idea why people want to put this all online.  And as I stated, this clearly appears genuine.  But I could be very wrong – fakes abound.
The point is also – there is nothing much to be done about this.  Again we have no diagnostic algorithms. We have no treatment protocols.
Here is article from Dr. Kory with his take on this issue
https://pierrekorymedicalmusings.com/p/new-study-provides-legal-support
There are so many confounders with this Pandemic, I wonder if we shall ever really know what’s happening with anyone individually or population wide.
All I do know is that avoiding infection with SARS-CoV-2 as much as possible is critical, and the best way to do that is to wear a fitted respirator, N-95 or better. Whatever else is another layer, but this is the primary layer and the most effective at preventing infection when possible.
Because it isn’t possible all the time; small children, medical emergencies, some disability that prevents it, cleaning the air is a duty of care that we as a society must have, no different than clean water.
Stay safe out there!
>>>There are so many confounders with this Pandemic, I wonder if we shall ever really know what’s happening with anyone individually or population wide.
As with much else in history, we will eventually discover what actually happened at least at the population level, but most of us will be dead of old age, if nothing else, by then.  As with science and scientists, history advances with the deaths of both the participants and historians with their particular advocacies; too many people want uncomfortable truths and the information supporting them suppressed and only by their deaths does that suppression weaken enough.
“Trump fires top US general CQ Brown in shake-up at Pentagon  ”
From the article: 
“Trump said he would nominate Air Force Lt Gen Dan Caine ……as the new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.”
——
I did a little digging as I have a suspicious mind…
That would be this Dan Caine https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-caine
1. Last month announced as a Venture Partner at Shield Capital. Shield Capital invest in similar (often the same) defence startups as Andreessen Horowitz and the Thiel boys – “Shield Capital invests in frontier technologies including cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, autonomy, and space.”
[Bonus: Shield Capital analyst’s article in Foreign Affairs  calling for the Pentagon/gov to harness the power of tech companies]
2. Also last month, Caine joined Thrive Capital as an advisor. Thrive is run by Joshua Kushner (brother of Jared), has Peter Thiel as an investor, and is itself an investor in Anduril among other companies in this part of the SV VC incestuous universe (also Open AI, Stripe).
Curiously Thrive’s website seems to be bare bones with parts “under scheduled maintenance” and the only reference I can find to Caine’s role is on his own LinkedIn page.
3. Even more also last month, he joined Palantir partner Voyager Space as “Chairman – National Security Board)
(4. Final also last month, he became a Venture Partner at SV Fintech VCs Ribbit Capital)

I believe this is the real reason the Joint Chief of Staff is being replaced. At the risk of broken-record behaviour, I think a huge realignment (read: money grab) in defense procurement is underway and this move supports my oft-repeated “spigot redirection thesis”
“spigot redirection thesis”
Indeed there’s that.
On another note:
If no war with China materializes, who does that reveal as the targets of all this mess?
It’s the final smash and grab against the population of the Metropole.  And we thought it would only happen to mud people on other continents or deplorables (of all varieties).  It’s looking more and more like the PayPal Mafia is making a play to eat up the defense contractors and banks.  Their first step is to get rid of all the regulators and the revolving door between the Pentagon and the MIC.
They’ve also just sacked the entire contracting department at OPM.  https://www.reddit.com/r/1102/comments/1iuzrv1/opm_has_officially_rifd_their_contracting_office/ and GSA apparently just waived education and warrant requirements for making their contracts.  This could mean that federal contracting procedures used to assure some level of fair playing field, may be completely going out the window.  I could see enlisted military personnel with no formal training just rubber-stamping sole source contracts to certain favored personalities, based on calls from higher up in the chain.
I really need to move my finances abroad, which is extra hard for an American 🤢.
My thinking is to buy a duplex somewhere without terrible climate risks, Atlanta darea say. Live in one half, rent the other. Rent follows inflation so you have a hedge and somewhere to live reasonably isolated from sh*t.
I’m looking to get out.  I don’t feel safe in this country and I know that oligarchs are eyeing retirement savings, RE appreciation, and social security as the last big pot of money to loot, just as they have looted so many private pensions in the last 40 years. I know there are risks everywhere but this country is almost as crazy as Israel or Milei’s Argentina.  Take a look at the West Bank to see how a lawless entity deals with little people’s property rights.
Nowhere is safe from climate change, as Helene and the freak heat waves in the Pacific Northwest (supposed climate refuge) shows.
I’m afraid if I leave the country it would be even easier for them to take my Social Security funds.
The F35 has a life cycle cost of $100 million.  The Air Force bought 1000.  Only 3 in 10 are mission capable at any one time ever.  The air force wants to buy 1500 more.  The B21 Raider has a procurement cost of $700 million each.  The air force wants to buy 100.  The B21 must fly hours to deliver its missile payload and cannot survive a modern peer to peer, multi system antiair environment (a hypersonic ballistic missile by contrast costs about $1 million each and is unstoppable).  Maybe shifting the grift will totally serendipitously save taxpayers money.
My ignorant take: the budget will not be reduced but America may get more useful weaponry for it’s dollars – Anduril’s Arsenal-1 idea does make sense, as does the move away from exquisite weapons and cost-plus contracts. The integration of AI into everything, I’m less sure about to put it mildly. 
Overall I think every dollar saved on things that go boom will go into building some janky Skynet knock-off.
Sacrifices will have to be made so we can send Elon to Mars.  The worsening climate projections indicate there’s not that much time left.  
I’m picturing a scene reminiscent of Khan, but with a rocket ship full of little Musks.
Poor kids.
Elon goes off to Mars and the rest of them Lord it up in Greenland.
Aha! The underlying endgame for deliberately accelerating global warming is finally revealed.
But what will they do when they realize that Greenland is way smaller than it looks on a map?
Plus, IIRC they never found all of the nuclear warheads that got dumped out over Greenland in 1968.
Oh! Oh! And the US military has just been suborned by MiniMes of not one, but two apartheid Dr. No clones, spawned in a secret Technocracy laboratory financed by Goldfinger with the gold that he stole from Fort Knox.
Yes! The next 007 movie script is writing itself, in real time.
Only if they are dumped into a polar bear infested part of Greenland in mid  summer.  No weapons or security guards.
Or more along the lines of funding the provision of Tesla’s Full Self Driving capability to the F35 and B21.
Just think of the savings in pilot training.
Planes don’t make much sense in the era of autonomous drones and long range missiles.
But take a look at how much Tesla has improved their vehicles in 10 years and then compare BYD 2015 to BYD 2025.  None of these vaporware hawking SV Broligarchs can turn the tide on American military decline, even if they earnestly wanted to.
Wouldn’t a more fair comparison for Tesla be the improvement from the Roadster to the Cybertruck?
With the decline in Tesla sales and the likely loss of the EPA carbon credit income Tesla needs a new income stream.
I was thinking more along the lines of Tesla drones and missiles. They seem to have mastered the art of hitting things.
Planes don’t make much sense in the era of autonomous drones and long range missiles.
Russians would disagree.
They barely used them in Ukraine.  
I’m aware of the latest developments in both Chinese and Russian aviation but I think it’ll switch over to unmanned drones as the tech gets better in the coming decade.  A manned plane is limited by pilot tolerance for acceleration, has to support the pilot’s weight and life support, and would be more risk adverse than an unmanned drone with the same capabilities.
They barely used them in Ukraine.
Only if by barely, you mean a lot. Su-35s (and Su-30s) have been patrolling the skies every single day. Su-34s have been less active until the glide kits for FABs have been developed, but have been dropping bombs on industrial scale ever since. Su-25s (and helicopters) have also been active daily, since the very beginning. In addition to that, all three types of Tupolev bombers have been launching long range missiles from safe distance all along. Su-57s also did some work, and also testing in real combat situations (including the incident when a companion drone had to be shot down over enemy territory). I think that Russians would say that planes would still make sense in the era of autonomous drones and long range missiles (and not only because they are missile carriers).
If you could point me to a resource for numbers of sorties versus drone usage, I would appreciate it.  I understand that certain types of bombs and missiles need to be air launched, but the planes stayed outside of any air defense range and my understanding is that the plane played a far smaller role than incorporation of various kinds of drones into the combat units on both sides.  
Saying daily isn’t very meaningful when we’re talking about something as big as the SMO.  So would appreciate a better understanding of the scale of I’m wrong.
Also, I was speaking more to the future and not the present.  Developing and testing autonomous drones with the capabilities of traditional fighters, bombers, and reconnaissance planes is going to take some time.  So I do expect to see their use for at least the next decade, but I really see no reason to continue on with piloted planes when drones will do the work for less money, less risk, and greater flexibility.
Here is one of the quick-search articles that would give a sense of scale.
https://tsn.ua/en/ato/zelenskyy-reveals-the-number-of-bombs-drones-and-missiles-russia-dropped-on-ukraine-in-a-week-2723964.html
In one week, Russia has used nearly 630 guided aerial bombs, approximately 550 attack drones, and over 100 missiles of various types against Ukraine.
All of those bombs were dropped by Su-34s (250-3000 kg per bomb). Drones are probably Gerans and the likes (50 kg warhead). Missiles are ground launched, and air launched, and some sea launched (300-500 kg warhead). These numbers do not include air launched unguided rockets and ATGMs, and small drones (kamikaze and grenade dropping), which are combined maybe thousand daily. Artillery fires 10.000+ shells of all calibers daily (152 mm shell is 40-50 kg, 122 mm about half of that).
Fighter jets fire very few air to air missiles, because they lack targets, but they need to fly as long as enemy has some airforce left.
Russians aren’t investing in Su-57 in order to ditch it in few years (or a decade). Experts have been repeatedly declaring tanks obsolete, for last 100+ years. My guess is that tanks and manned aircraft are here to stay in one way on another, until we get to a point when wars are fought with sticks and stones (as per old prediction). :)
That being said, Musk making full self “driving” fighters and bombers is the future that will give us the first trillionaire. :)
Thank you.  Based on this, it seems like air launched missiles and bombs account for less than 1 percent of munitions used. 
I agree that planes and tanks will be used into the next year’s, because they’re there.  But are they actually useful when facing any opponent with air defense and anti-tank weapons?  Hezbollah fended off the Israelis tanks easily and Hamas made it very dangerous to operate tanks in Gaza.  It’s only in almost entirely disarmed populations such as the West Bank where tanks are fully effective. In Ukraine, my understanding is that the Russians avoided anywhere with air defense, even though Ukrainian sure defense has been very degraded since the early months of the war. 
I’m sure Elon, Palantir, Anduril, and various Israeli Unit 8200 tied outfits are salivating at the prospect of knocking out the current pigs at the feeding trough.  But in the real world, these guys have been getting completely outclassed by the Russians, Chinese, and even to some extent the Iranians/Yemenese/Hezbollah/Hamas.  I wouldn’t assume that they can ever reduce the other side to fighting with sticks and stones.
Russian VKS have launched close to 500,000 sorties during the SMO, strike drones are very much limited in what they can do.  One cannot carry two FAB-1500 for instance, or response time, speed etc…
Thanks. The Pentagon soaks up a major portion of the budget and is full of boondoggles like the F 35. Indeed the plane is a standing joke around here. Musk just called it junk which should be canceled.
Perhaps any replacement of current Defense Dept management would be an improvement. Unfortunately when it comes to gold plated turkeys in the weapons arsenal they may have to get those past a Congress which keeps them alive to promote jobs in their districts.
Ben Panga’s curiosity about the choice of Lt. Gen. Dan Caine turns out to describe the very definition of private equity.
For my part, I’m just happy that the president reminded the general staff that he is their commander-in-chief.  Trump should have done this during his first term.
Trump’s opponents like to cite the Constitution.  He can do that, too.
As for the new guy, of course he’s somebody aligned with the current government.  That is generally true everywhere.  War is politics.  Armed forces are political organizations.  Senior military posts are political appointments.  In the USA, even a promotion to three-star rank requires express government approval.
Used to be that ALL officers had to be approved by the Senate, I think–most were perfunctory, but some ran into issues, like the promotion of a James Stewart to one-star general rank (yes, the famous actor, but he was also a highly decorated combat pilot during World War 2 and an excellent military leader who stayed in the Air Force Reserve)  when a single Senator decided that that was unseemly somhow.  I think the procedures have been modified so that only promotions and appointments to field grade and above (and some specified roles) now require Senate consent (ppl with direct experience, pls comment!)
> I think a huge realignment (read: money grab) in defense procurement is underway 
On the bright side, it seems plausible that such a change would not actually result in increased military capabilities, so it might in future be harder to break things here and there around the globe. 
For some time I’ve thought of the US defense budget as an overt jobs program and a covert  “peace through weakness” agenda. The peace agenda hasn’t worked out very well, I admit, but it might have been even worse if we had been better at prevailing in the conflicts we engage in.
 /s
Fun comment!!! What im hearing is that i could profit by investing in thiel backed defense companies. But seriously. I do think that a defense money realignment would be interesting. Id expect some form of kickback from the MIC, but it might just be the democrats flailing around more with messaging that doesnt land. Trump admin has a solid argument for shifting money away from current defense contractors – they do kinda suck lol. But im doubtful that techbro MIC will be any better than traditional MIC. I need to imagine how this will play out.
Wait a minute… The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has to be a general (4 stars) on active duty. There’s no way a general could do the things your candidate is doing. He has no time. You know, with a population north of 330 million, we have a lot of people with the same names who are pretty close in age. I’ve found at least five people with the same first and last name as me on the intertubes, and neither my first nor last names are common. This is FUD.
Chartbook 354: Of trains and tanks. Or does the German political class actually know how bad things are? Adam Tooze (Micael T)
If even the famous German trains aren’t running on time, what else is left? I guess everyone recalls what people said about Mussolini and trains (even if it was way overblown), which might signal the AfD’s time has finally come? Given apparent penchant that the German elite has for supporting genocide, bad things might be on the horizon.
That dog looks pretty contented with his current situation, surely that’s a summer location given this week even here in the southeastern US we got some serious low overnight temps over a 48 hour window more or less.

Jeffrey Sachs just told the European Parliament that Jake Sullivan privately admitted what he refused to acknowledge publicly—a simple truth about NATO that could have averted the Ukraine war. Utterly damning. Everything Sullivan touches turns into chaos, destruction and misery.’
I think that Jeffrey Sachs misread the situation here. He believed Jake Sullivan. I think that starting a war with Russia using the Ukraine as a proxy force was the plan all along. People like Sullivan wanted this war as he thought that the NATO trained & equipped military would beat the Russians on the battlefield. So here he fobbed Sachs off as he was in on the war plans and only wanted Sachs to shut up and go away while the ‘adults in the room’ carried out their plans. Now that the war is entering its final stages, Sullivan has made himself scarce.
I think of it as the day Jeffrey woke up. I checked his CV, and Sachs likely gained his audience with Sullivan in his role as advisor to Chief EU Gardener, Josep Borrell.
So, the EU is still huffing that 120-year-old Mackinder “pivot of history” smoke.  More recently, it was replaced in 1992 with  Fukuyama’s “the end of history.”    Now, history has re-started and the pivot of history has moved farther east, imo.  It’s hard to let go of longtime organizing principles and beliefs. / ;)
an aside:  this is sort of funny in the “you’re kidding, right?” category of funny. / ;)
 Germany issues warning to US
Europe should make it clear to President Trump that failure to back “liberal democracies” will come at a price, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has insisted 
https://swentr.site/news/613126-germany-us-russia-ukraine/
I remember back in the day thinking the Greens were the peace party.
The Greens were the peace party, but it was subsumed by the neoliberal Borg collective as the leadership wanted their not so metaphorical thirty pieces of silver.
Sullivan is a Hillary Clinton protege. Of course he is a war monger.
And his spouse has her own interesting professional history.

Did they deliberately pour gasoline on a fire?  Or was it an accident?
Sullivan was right that it was never going to exactly happen.  How popular would a US Nuclear war over Ukraine be in the US?
Sachs was correct that the war is being fought to preserve the right of Ukraine to enter into security agreements that were never going to happen.
Just background … here is John Mersheimer listing why NATO membership for Ukraine was the cause of this War.  https://mearsheimer.substack.com/p/who-caused-the-ukraine-war

re UK councils bankruptcy. This is an issue I waded into – perhaps taking the bait inadvisedly in last day or so. However, it was good to hear that this kind of issue – the breaking up of society into electoral groups that can no longer rely on the insurance principle of having a social contract where the richer help properly maintain services – is not specific to the UK.
Council Tax was a band-aid (heavily based on the old “rates system”) introduced by then Prime Minister John Major after Thatcher got ousted, in an attempt to defuse a major meltdown in Britain, where the poll tax riot came to be seen as one of the worst riots in the UK capital since Peterloo in early 19th Century. No Party wants to touch the “new” (cough) Council Tax since it automatically will cause major outcry in the NIMBYs and home-owner classes. Yet the system of funding of local councils – where most funding is via direct grants from central government and any deviation from projected revenue has a massively disproportionate effect upon the 25% of funding Council Tax imposes on locals has inevitably led to even “old-school Good One-Nation Tory councils” getting into trouble. But of course “leftie” cities like Nottingham get highlighted by the major media (and the lickspittle Guardian). 
As I’ve discussed elsewhere, it is ironic that Nottingham never gave in to the StageCoach/FirstBus duopoly and keeps winning the prize for best bus operator in the UK via its independent (but I *think* partially city owned) bus company. I’ve lived in various cities and repeatedly had to tell my mum that the cost per mile and comfort levels on Nottm City buses was so far ahead of the duopoly running other cities I lived in when she complained.
Nottingham, in the boom years, brought back trams etc. These were necessarily (given the artificially small size of “Nottingham City”) co-ventures with the donut of borough councils surrounding the city. The praise for these all went to the boroughs who enabled posh people to commute into central Nottm easily and enabled moves to massively pedestrianise Nottingham centre, Of course, when central funding (courtesy of the Conservatives and the Lib Dem allies during the coalition) began to collapse, Nottingham got the blame. 
Ironically the “flight from the city”, seen across the UK and US, has now become “flight from the suburbs” and the donut of borough councils are now beginning to feel the pinch. They’re all struggling to find a reason why “things are family blogged”. How’s about “because Nottingham and Nottinghamshire were divorced by the Tories so revenue sharing and insurance principles were destroyed”?  Irony alert: the big issue round here is whether all the borough councils (sections of the “donut”) should merge to form a “super-council” to spread costs etc. Of course (though nobody admits it) the roadblock is “who is likely to get majority electoral control of such a council since some boroughs are Labour, the one represented by arch-one-nation former Tory grandee Ken Clarke is Tory, and the others are beginning to lean Reform). 
Let’s be clear. If this nonsense isn’t sorted soon then all of the parliamentary constituencies in South Notts, and potentially all of Notts – the KEYSTONE of the red wall – will be Reform in 2029. Labour are in the last chance saloon but won’t grasp the nettle to sort out this mess regarding local government.
‘Labour are in the last chance saloon but won’t grasp the nettle to sort out this mess regarding local government’.
C’mon now. That would mean that Keir Starmer would have to make a decision.
Indeed. Instead he has minions like my local MP saying “vote for me, vote for MEEEEEEEE, I’m LGBQT and have your interests at heart!”. 
If you really were insterested in local people you’d have set your stall up at ASDA, NOT Sainsbury’s (where you’re less likely to have someone take a pop at you). And no I’m not voting for you cause you’re gay. Stop doing divide and rule. I’m never voting for you cause you don’t understand a balance sheet and got onto a House of Commons Subcommittee IMMEDIATELY on election – something that NEVER happened in years gone by unless you bought your way there or did something I can’t refer to on here. Any politically savvy Brits who know how MPs traditionally “climbed the ladder” know you NEVER went straight onto a parliamentary subcommittee unless you were an already nationally regarded expert. This guy ain’t that. 
Instead of putting wedding pics of you and your hubby on X, try putting pics of you being there for re-opening of a SHOP in our main suburb. That’s what people wanna see (including me). And you wonder why Reform are cleaning up around here? Sheesh.
A PS re trams. The “donut section borough” that benefited MOST from the trams was Rushcliffe….the borough whose Parliamentary Constituency happened to be that of Ken Clarke (alas alumnus of both my secondary school and Cambridge College). Thus Nottm City taxpayers paid large amounts to enable rich Tories to get into Nottm on the cheap.
Those people who go on about “Robin Hood travel” corruption are frankly liars: YOUR favourite borough was only an average funder but huge beneficee of the tram extensions. So WHY are there huge ongoing traffic issues? These are through YOUR borough. Quit saying “Nottingham corruption via their Robin Hood trans-operator scheme”. We all know that’s rubbish. The funding for the trams extensions (into Rushcliffe – the Tory borough) were pushed by tories. Quit making crap up. For anyone wanting proof, LOOK at the map of the tram extension……it’s all for the rich borough. If you have a problem then it’s because your pet tories are the problem. Your pet companies have screwed the local authorities left right and centre and we have a total hole in our city centre thanks to the INTU scandal. 
The poor areas of Nottm that got served by the trams from the early 1990s were only served because they were necessarily on the route out to posh areas. One area, (Hyson Green) happens to be where I was born in early 1970s. Back then it was back to back Victorian slums with no toilets. Thankfully it’s all been knocked down and replaced and there is a revistalised area. But the “you must be Nottingham from 13th centure” mob don’t like that. Sheesh.
I could go back to give history lesson involving an Earl from MILES away which skewed up nottingham but I don’t want to insert too many links and it is easy to look at wikipedia to learn why Nottm is so messed up.
TL;DR Nottingham is becoming Detroit
The Leonard Peltier video made my day, I can’t stop smiling. Thanks for sharing!
Yes.  This and finally letting Assange go home are the only good things that Biden did in his horrible 4 years in office.
Lina Khan was one more good thing. She rocks! Oh, and also Deb Haaland as Secretary of the Interior — very good also.
Their work has been undone by the first thirty days of Trump 2.0.  We aren’t even going to have a functional SEC or CFPB anymore.
All the people onboard in the last year or two are now fired in mass via the “Valentine’s Day Massacre” of 2025.
Me too! Finally a horrible wrong was righted. Bless you Leonard!
Yes, seeing Peltier with that smile on his face made my day; he was old, gray, and tottering, but with a big smile.  I am thinking that he believes in his life’s choices.
While reading the archived FT ant-woke correction article, I came across this Rick Buckler obit. Nothing like a small portion of melancholy to pair with my morning coffee to start my day off.

re.  Culture  Critic’s color/colour thread….
Critic left out an important aspect (but not the only)….any type of color (outside of  browns, beige, mother of pearl, etc.) was expensive pre-19th century, and thus a show of wealth, status, particularly blue hues in the time of Titian.
color has never been as cheap as now.   so Just as “skinny” morphed to be an elite marker, the Overton Window has shifted away.
bonus factoid,   anon. Chinese hinterlanders discovered synthetic dyes >2000 years before the Germans.   but of course,Confucian scholars hated decadent colors too, just like Plato.
Certainly the choice of darker colours in films and TV shows is nothing more than a trend. I saw a video the other day comparing the bright colours of the original film “Shogun” with Richard Chamberlain and its modern iteration where the colours were so somber if not gloomy. And as the following link points out, in the final battle of “Game of Thrones” it was so dark it was hard to see what was going on. It does not have to be this way so I think that this is Hollywood imposing their choices on everybody else because they know better-
https://variety.com/2022/film/news/why-movies-so-dark-hard-to-see-batman-1235195535/
As for cars, well, “50 Shades of Gray” was supposed to be a film, not a palette of car colour choices-
https://www.consumerreports.org/consumerist/a-brief-history-of-car-colors-and-why-are-we-so-boring-now/
Hollywood’s original three strip Technicolor system was considerably influenced by a Technicolor employee named Nathalie Kalmus who insisted on bright colors as seen in, say, The Wizard of Oz. Eventually the industry dropped the bulky Technicolor system–for the most part–and switched to film similar to that used in consumer cameras and filmmakers could be more individual and creative with color. See Gordon Willis photog in the Godfather movies.
So yes these things in part a fashion but not only.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Kalmus
The darkness in modern movie fight scenes is an economic choice. CGI is expensive especially when it’s done well. The producers will darken a fight scene to hide bad CGI and reduce the amount of detail to be rendered, reducing the cost of the fight scene. Its gotten so predictable of a plot characteristic, scene gets dark you knew a fight was going to happen.
I would say going digital is the crucial factor. Film has way more dynamic range and detail than digital. Every serious photographer will tell you that.
Random colour counter-example. When I lived in Sydney my project manager bought a new car. The colour was what we all called “vomit orange”. She loved it. We asked why (since back then in the early 2010s Sydney was already dominated by black/grey/white/silver). She said “I’m fed up of being unable to find my family blogging car in IKEA car-park. Now I see it a mile off.”
Good point. If I were to buy a car I would definitely go for something like lime green, not the silver I had in Sydney and which drove me insane.
Orange has a good safety profile too:
https://www.carloans.com.au/top-10/top-10-safest-colours-for-cars
Black is the least safest car color and has a higher likelihood of being involved in an accident.
+1. Ours is a bright iridescent orange. Spot it instantly in a supermarket car park. Unfortunately one other local made the same choice, and looked at me strangely when I tried unlocking hers…
I love silver cars.  We have 4 street vehicles and only one isn’t silver.  Our old pick up truck is blue.
1.  I like an anonymous and unassuming car and don’t want to stand out.  No vanity plates, no bumper stickers, etc.
2.  Silver is great in my hot climate at reflecting heat.  White would be better, but see #3.
3.  Silver doesn’t show dirt or dust much.  I never notice how dirty it is until it gets washed and detailed 1X/year.
4.  I keep cars forever so I wouldn’t necessarily want to buy a trendy color that would look old in a few years.
I confess to liking some of the new cars I’ve seen that are a dark, saturated, orange which is one of my favorite colors to wear, but I don’t think I’ll buy a car in that color.
I’ve been grumbling along the same lines as that thread by Culture Critic for years. The movies of Pedro Almodóvar can be an antidote and useful contrast to the desaturation of so much cinema and cinematic TV. On video cameras, “picture profiles” are all about achieving different kinds of “cinematic” desaturation, or so it seems to me.
I’m inclined to interpret the loss of color as relating to the loss of creative confidence in the arts generally.
Speaking of Almodóvar, I can recommend his recent book “The Last Dream”. I had no idea he was such a good writer but he really is.
Film vs digital actually goes further. Digital recording can never be “upscaled” beyond the pixel level it was recorded at. Film can always be rescanned for DVD or higher resolution Blu-Ray etc. 
I might be convinced that certain digital recordings are sufficiently high-res so that there is no benefit to any greater resolution. However, the issues discussed here regarding colour grading etc and generally “messing about” makes me think we have not yet reached that point. 
Ergo I think we should be using film. At least we retain the ability to scan at various ranges etc. It’s a case of “keeping maximum flexibility”.
Film archives say that under good conditions in a vault, 35mm film can be preserved for two centuries.
They are more worried about digital, as the support media can fail catastrophically in a matter of years, plus you need working hardware to read that support media, and support for that working hardware, etc. etc.
Single Microsoft is all about “forced obsolescence”, the best case would probably be some Linux file system like EXT4 for the archive media, and then of course you have to have a backup, and copy the backup every few years to a fresh HDD, but when you consider that a single BluRay could be 20 GB, and that’s still not even the quality of film… yeah, it begins to look like you might as well just archive a film negative.
I am not a movie professional or cinematographer.  A simple google search I just did tells me that just 8% of modern films and TV are shot with actual film.  All of the rest are digital.  Perhaps someone out there with more knowledge can elucidate that.  I literally cringe when patients bring me stuff from Dr. Google, so I understand the limitations of internet searching, especially with the search engines of today.
It may be just as well that all the digital films end up unreadable in a few decades.  As things are going now, the movies being made now are largely going to be a blight on the reputation of this generation in the future.  It is not just the color palette that is rendering the vast majority of them unwatchable.
Yes practically everything now is shot with electronic cameras and why not? Interestingly however there is now a climate controlled archive in LA where film transfers of these digital movies are stored on the theory that digital copies may indeed be vulnerable.
One should also mention that vast chunks of early cinema have crumbled into dust in rusty film cans or were simply trashed. 
Film does have a unique look and some natural light French films from the 60s are achingly beautiful. But the big special effects films of today are heavily generated inside computers so there’s no reason not to photograph them digitally.
I’m totally with you on hoping digital copies don’t survive and we retain analogue but the stories that have emerged regarding some key movies (Star Wars, the true horror film Sam Neill was in but but which got partially lost) make me think we need more attention to preserving analogue film
I’d pay anything to see original cut of Event Horizon, even though it is undoubtedly a pretty challenging awful film.
Thanks. Though I don’t have an example I can link to, I do recall examples of films that that were found, after being widely considered as “lost” and they, thanks to forward thinking about humidity etc, were stored in places that preserved them. IIRC, even the original Star Wars had a scene or two “rescued”.
A great film is considered “gold dust” – it it both readable and scanable to any degree of digital accuracy. After “digi-rot” I can’t help but wonder if we would be better served filming via film and storing it in appropriately accilmatised place.
I was an early adopter of CDs in early 1980s. Two of my most treasured classical music CDs succombed to rot. To be fair, later manufacturing processes solved this and I’ve never had any of my 400+ CDs and hundred of DVDs/BluRays succomb. But there are companies who have estimated when these are likely to fail. I’ve ripped all the important stuff so I’m OK but I’m still very aware that “old films” etc should be preserved. But what if the Blu-rays have been burnt to disc in a stupid fashion?
We’ve had this discussion here before. Ironically if all those lost silent films shot on nitrate base had been released during the home video era then millions of copies would exist around the world and they could have been saved.
Which is too say that film too has its problems when it comes to storage and particularly color film which uses organic dyes that are subject to deterioration. In any case don’t expect film to make a comeback. Kodak does still manufacture it in Rochester but in a much more limited way.
Large parts of Lang’s Metropolis were considered lost, but a 16mm transfer in poor condition was found in Argentina and you can now at least watch a complete version. The problem with Star Wars is not the film but Lucas himself. If you want to see the original, track down the “despecialized” edition that has been reconstructed by fans who love the film but have come to hate Lucas’ attitude towards it. 
Upshot: tons of stuff has been lost and will be lost, but I would submit usually not because the film support itself deteriorated but more because nobody cared or looked after it. (There were also cases such as Japan in which the US Occupation destroyed many films considered “feudal”).
Interestingly, none of the early pioneers thought cinema was more than a fad. Edison lost interest. Méliès actually destroyed many of his own films in a bout of frustration, and the Lumières very famously said it was “an invention with no future” (a statement which Godard inserted into his film Le Mépris. Clearly, they were all very mistaken, as it became the dominant form of popular culture for the entire century. As Bazin put it, cinema is neither art nor industry but an industrial art that will disappear as soon as the commercial aspect is gone. Preservation costs money. Temperature controlled vaults cost money, etc.
Well, you are correct. Our ever expanding copyright laws mean that old films are at the mercy of whoever owns them. And restoration and preservation cost money.
Plus there are many, perhaps a majority, of films that don’t really merit preservation. Speaking strictly for myself the loss of the Star Wars franchise would provoke no tears.
But, as I say above our digital age means that copies of current films are ubiquitous so copies of almost anything current are likely to survive. If it’s a blu-ray copy then you are getting as much visual detail as you would get in many movie theaters which are almost all now digital.
So visiting future aliens sifting through the detritus of our civilization will be saying “who was this person, George Lucas?”
Terry , I guess you have never seen Topaz Video AI in action.  Up-rez of digital recordings far beyond the original pixel resolution is done routinely now.
Does this really work?
I have so many family videos and things like that.  I would love to do this if this really works.  
Do you have any experience with this?
Doc, there are ways to just capture what you’ve got to digital that will at least stabilize it and you can make backups. There are services that will do this, to safeguard your media. Anything on a videotape or in arcane video formats, for example, should be transferred, as it can deteriorate. As Carolinian points out, above, more copies is the best protection. And there are simple, standard techniques like deinterlacing that can improve a video image.
But upscaling is pretty controversial and especially anything treated with “AI”. Basically, you can’t introduce details that weren’t in the video without unpredictable and often downright weird results. Many people who are serious about film just reject these “restorations” but they are being forced on us anyway. E.g. Check this out:
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rfHJbvNYqKY
Reminds me of the life being squeezed out of digital audio with all the compression and other over processing.  Loss of dynamics noticeable over the years.
One take on what happened with digital audio:
https://www.soundguys.com/the-loudness-war-51513/
some new artists are actually incorporating this into their music! i think the embrace of really intense sounds is fun. like speedcore, hyperpop, some forms of soundcloud rap.
my favorite example is sematary. my mom says he sounds like the music they play to torture prisoners in guantanamo bay but i really like it! here’s one of my favorite songs of his: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=REGXZZ67F_k
Not sure if the audio engineering that went into this is similar, but for intense sounds bordering on torturous, Throbbing Gristle was a favorite of some of my college radio friends back in the day – https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8klW9trVTQ
I wonder if one possibility for why we’re seeing this shift is desaturation, sun-bleaching.  With more sunlight, colours become desaturated, overexposed, less vibrant – similar to overexposed Kodak photos from the 70’s, only this time could it be it’s our own eyesight, possibly due to there being more direct sunlight in the world?  Another possibility, pollution creates haze, which will have the same effect.  Or, could it also be LED and fluourescent indoor lighting?  Artists who paint know natural light makes for a more visible and true spectrum of colours, if you paint indoors under fluorescent lighting your paintings will tend to use less vibrant colour, but do all the fashion designers, photographers, videographers, architects, etc., those producing our culture and cityscapes, also know this and compensate for it?

“The future is so rich and wonderful and how dare you stop our march towards the future (which is actually completely unconstrained technofeudalism for the masses).  Are you some kind of luddeite who hates human progress…”
Yes I am.

I read that article you linked, GramSci, and came to the conclusion that the author is a true believer.  What he’s describing is the new utopia of intelligence and wealth that will come to all who embrace AI as their savior.
This paragraph towards the end of the essay, “Their utopian rhetoric often glosses over risks: job displacement, centralized corporate or state power, and tools that could entrench surveillance and the oppression of individual freedom. Their vision of progress is not concerned with us—the little people” ignores the entire rest of the essay in which the author’s own utopian rhetoric glosses over the risks of job displacement, etc.  It is clear to me that the author is not one of the “little people” now; however, at some point he may find himself in the same boat with the rest of us.
The gung-ho Techno-Optimist includes this without any understanding of how it relates to his overall point, much less his disparagement of those who think an “infinite pie” can’t fit on a finite planet.
You see, back in the 16th century, the English relied on burning trees for energy. But as the population grew, they started running out, and that meant running out of power.

Unless a robot can upgrade the electrical wiring on a Victorian or other vintage structure without interfering with its aesthetic appeal by running a lot of exterior conduit, my kid’s job is safe. On second thought a lot of his contractual work is currently paid for by the relatively highly paid in IT and finance whose jobs are at risk of being rendered redundant by AI. In terms of social relations favoring the owners of capital at the expense of the worker bees, AI absent a new and improved New Deal will exacerbate our currently diminishing state of social cohesion. At this rate of improvement the entirety of the U.S. could become flyover country.
A little bit ago there was a link here about the massive cost and time to build one train station in the Boston area and some discussion about why the US can’t do infrastructure anymore.  
I will just add that the Big Dig is the gift that keeps on giving.  Giving falling concrete – if you’re driving through Beantown, maybe wear a helmet.
Boston drivers don’t slow down for anything. 
Although that particular tunnel is fifty years old and wasn’t part of the Big Dig…but who needs maintenance? AI will give the US Infinite Pie :-/ (op cit.).
Regards to traffic construction, the long running joke in North Carolina has been that those infamous orange traffic cones were the state’s wildflower…given the prevalence of roadway works being a constant on I85 and I40 in and around the Research Triangle, and then further south there is I85 and I77 roadways in and through Charlotte.
It’s a long term jobs program, and in recent years NC toll roads became the new thing.  Of course population growth has largely boomed in the past decade plus.

In Pa we used to joke that the road sings for construction zones were worded backwards, it should have been “Temporary Improvement, Permanent Inconvenience”.
The Pru tunnel where the concrete fell is about 30 years older than the Big Dig.

Some years ago one of the cabin owners was really enthusiastic about the game camera he’d installed by wrapping it around a tree-easy peasy, and all the action he got from it. bears, mountain lions, but no tigers, etc. 
Another cabin owner had a friend with a convincing enough looking abominable snowman outfit that he borrowed and waited for the snow to come and around mid winter after a snowmobile ride up, strides like a Yeti with a lurch in front of the camera, and then had to wait 3 months to get the much anticipated response from the mark, who roared with laughter upon watching the evidence.

The tariff debate blew up in my face when Petro finally agreed to receive the flight with deportees after Trump’s threats. The outcome was predictable. But what will happen to such de facto tariff policies against countries like China or Germany? That is my concern. Then I came across Michael Roberts’ blog post, “Trade tariffs as economic policy: the debate”, which I want to recommend (and discuss), because, although I am not an economist, I found his arguments very solid. Not only does he put on the agenda what has been discussed so far (Pettis, Krugman, etc.), but he also discusses it from a Marxist perspective.
“I came across Michael Roberts’ blog post, ‘Trade tariffs as economic policy: the debate’, which I want to recommend (and discuss), because, although I am not an economist, I found his arguments very solid.”
Excellent comment and article by Michael Roberts: https://thenextrecession.wordpress.com/2025/02/08/trade-tariffs-as-economic-policy-the-debate/ .
The point is that Pettis and Krugman evidently have no idea that China is actually investing in making stuff, making wonderful stuff, such as high yield, variable environmental conditions tolerant, high nutrient rice or wheat or corn, or making magical stuff such as actual autonomous electric cars for under $10,000.
While in the USA there is a desperate search to privatize any services not privatized. More than tariffs, there has to be a will to reshore some industry.
USA: a service economy cannibalizing and monopolizing services
The waste colonialism of the affluent North now is practiced upon its own periphery, too, akin to Chris Hedges’ “sacrifice zones” in the US. For example, solid municipal waste being exported from rich EU countries to poor EU countries to be incinerated, because of the corruption which ensures regulatory non-interference in the latter.
“Potomac River Midair Collision: An Accident Waiting to Happen”
Been thinking about it but for the life of me I can’t think of a good reason why you would establish a “helicopter alley” that crosses one of the busiest flight paths in the nation with only a hundred feet or so of separation. More so when a lot of those military helicopter flights are training flights. If they really wanted to do that, then maybe they should have had them training over the Potomac river south of Washington. Or maybe just under the flight path of fighters, bombers and transport planes flying into and out of Andrews Air Force base if they wanted to go that way.
“if they wanted to go that way”
Double entendre?
“I can’t think of a good reason why you would establish a ‘helicopter alley’ that crosses one of the busiest flight paths…”
Really important.  Remember too that the T flight path necessarily involves altitude changes, since the path leads to a landing strip.
That Larry Johnson link–by a pilot–is an excellent article.
And it says helicopters have now been forbidden from the National Airport flight path.

Albert John Dunlap (July 26, 1937 – January 25, 2019) was an American corporate executive. He was known at the peak of his career as a professional turnaround management specialist and downsizer. The mass layoffs at his companies earned him the nicknames “Chainsaw Al” and “Rambo in Pinstripes”, after he posed for a photo wearing an ammo belt across his chest. It was later discovered that his reputed turnarounds were elaborate frauds and his career was ended after he engineered a massive accounting scandal at Sunbeam Products, now a division of Newell Brands, that forced the company into bankruptcy. Dunlap is on the lists of “Worst CEOs of All Time” published by several business publications. Fast Company noted that Dunlap “might score impressively on the Corporate Psychopathy checklist” and in an interview, Dunlap freely admitted to possessing many of the traits of a psychopath, but considered them positive traits such as leadership and decisiveness.
Yeah I recall his “illustrious” corporate career as an executive being covered before, that’s the type that almost, I suggest, makes a Jack Welch appealing as a corporate CEO that axed jobs and also ixnayed his company’s manufacturing base in the states…Welch is of course , just one of many but he and his wife could add some polish to his resume after retiring from GE.
However some people really enjoy their corporate villain scum.  I did notice a few analyst reports on the opportunity to buy UNH on a dip, following the announcement by the DOJ.  Wall Street, where monopoly is not just the board game!  \sarc

Trump’s Radical Realist Foreign & Security Policy Changes Could Change the US, Geopolitics, and the World
https://marksleboda.substack.com/p/trumps-radical-realist-foreign-and
However the show worth the time does not live up to the headline. Actually I do not quite understand Sleboda´s enthusiasm re: change. The shift is rather fast forwarding the tilt to China which was the ultimate goal all along.
Nixon makes an interesting suggestion however – the US´s intention to separate RU from China by offering them an obedient EU. Which won´t work however. Then what will happen? So eventually we end up at square one again.
And in addition: If the EU refuses how will Trump react? He could very well crush EU economically. So what´s it gonna be…
To quote Dr. Banner in the jingoist “The Avengers – Infinity War”: “You are so fucked now.”

re: AP
As I understand it, the spat between AP and T is about AP’s refusal to use T’s new term “Gulf of America” instead of Gulf of Mexico.  OK, fine.
  Personally, every time I hear T say “Gulf of America” I  hear Golf of America, and expect to see maps with the Golf of America label include little green arrow tags denoting golf courses in the US and Mexico.  / ha
irrespective of politics…..this is a weird hill for AP to choose to make a stand, versus all the random DC stuff that has happened over the past 30 years.
IMO.  YMMV
First they came for the cartographers, and I did not speak out because I was not a cartographer.
Also I really wanted to own the libs.
This makes me think of the ridiculous spat between Japan and SK over the name of Sea of Japan/East Sea.  Koreans threw around enough tantrum that a lot of maps now have both names  now.  It’s stupid, but people have fought (even literally) over many stupid things…

Talked to a friend in the know, and he related that there have been firings across the board in Sequoia NP (save fee collectors and law enforcement apparently-the perps know what they’re doing) of permanent positions with an emphasis on science’y jobs, with the plan as of now to not open Potwisha* & Lodgepole campgrounds in the summer, the latter being the largest in the park. All visitor amenities will be lessened, and if we get the usual jam job of a couple million visitors, it’ll put the old record of a 6 mile backup on Highway 198 to the park entrance once upon a time very much in doubt.
Disarray was a good way to put it as far as the survivors of the purge were concerned as to the nature of their workplace, and he also told me of the USGS (US Geological Survey) being told that their usual compliment of 10-12 seasonal workers will be difficult to fill, as a total of 70 seasonal workers was available for the whole country now.
This is part for the course with Bizarro World FDR, he’s ridding the forest for the trees and raking out occupations.
* a stoner’s whet dream of a name
In other words it was already a mess during high summer and now will get worse?
I camped at Sequoia many years ago and don’t remember particularly large campgrounds. Have they built more?
Of course none of us are defending arbitrary firings but overcrowding in certain parks seems to be an ongoing problem. The last time i visited Zion the headquarters parking lot was full and I had to park outside the entrance and walk in.
Most any 50% more weekend holiday (Mem Day, 4th July, Labor Day) can be hectic here, where swarms of say 30 vehicles are let in without collecting fees if the backup warrants it, so Sequoia NP loses out on those fees in order to move ’em a long little doggies.
Sometimes you get long backups when you least expect it, and once they clear customs, then have to jockey for a parking spot in the Giant Forest and good luck with that.
Dorst Campground was as large as Lodgepole, but has been closed for years now, and thinking about it-this leaves little Buckeye campground as the only campground open in Sequoia NP in the main part of the park this year, yikes.  
Haven’t heard anything about the 2 campgrounds in Mineral King yet.
The parks are supposed to preserve and not just serve as tourist attractions (your neighbors might not agree). So perhaps some attendance discouragement of the only casually interested is not such a bad thing.
At any rate I’m glad I’ve already seen most of them. Back East, in my area, the Smokies are about it. Last time I passed through and on a holiday weekend no less it was unbelievably crowded.
It doesn’t mean much to me, as 99% of the visitors go to 1% of Sequoia NP, and I’m more like the 1% of visitors that go to 99% of Sequoia NP.
If the American people surrender unconditionally to the Chinese by May 31st, can we get 🚠 at every NPS scenic lookout and 20,000 miles of HSR built by 2030?

Yes.  But it can be revoked at any time at the discretion of Xi Jinping.  You also give up access to all future legal and administrative remedies for everything you did since you were five.

Chinese researchers find new target to treat Parkinson’s disease
Chinese researchers at Huashan Hospital, an affiliate of Fudan University in Shanghai, have become the world’s first to discover FAM171A2, a new therapeutic target for treating Parkinson’s disease, according to research * published in the journal Science on Friday.
Led by Yu Jintai, deputy head of Huashan Hospital’s neurology department, the team has also identified a candidate drug that can slow the progression of Parkinson’s disease based on this new finding. This discovery was made after five years of research.
The research was also conducted under the auspices of the National Center for Neurological Diseases and the National Key Laboratory of Brain Function and Brain Diseases.
Parkinson’s disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s and seriously affects patients’ daily lives. Traditional drugs and surgical treatments only address the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease and do not block its progression.
The number of people with the disease may reach 13 million by 2040, with Chinese patients accounting for nearly half.
Pathological alpha-synuclein is a key pathogenic protein in the disease. Its aggregation can disrupt the normal function of neurons and lead to their death. It can also spread, damaging adjacent healthy neurons. When it affects different regions of the brain, it can cause motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremor and rigidity, as well as cognitive impairments like memory decline…

re: The anti-woke overcorrection is here Financial Times
An example of this is the recent Delta crash in Toronto.  The news and forums are abuzz with the shocking revelation that one of the pilots was a woman, therefore concluding that DEI is the reason for the crash.    
(Google “toronto delta crash dei” and you’ll see what I mean.)
I had an argument yesterday and on one issue I lacked the research since it´s Berlinale at the moment:
When I tried to explain and justify a few of Vance´s points in Munich re: freedom of speech the counter-argument was that the US administration was hitting heavily on academia and firing people if they defended DEI. But how substantial is the latter suppression of freedeom of speech in comparison to what is happening in Europe?

Thanks for this link.
DEI is not meritocratic and likely from an HR perspective not legal, since meritocracy is still the foundation of public service in developed countries.
I suppose in defending DEI, a person would be speaking freely, however having sat through many hours of ridiculous DEI “training”, DEI itself is a proscription of speech.  And just trying complaining about DEI to your HR department rather than defending it.
Re: Is Trump Wrong on Tariffs
I may have missed it, but it doesn’t seem that NC linked to Yanis Varoufakis’s article earlier in the month that described a risky “masterplan” behind the apparent petulant arbitrariness of the tariffs. https://unherd.com/2025/02/why-trumps-tariffs-are-a-masterplan/
Since this is the sort of thing that NC is really geared towards and many people including Yves were actively involved in commenting on the Greek debt crisis, I’d love to know what Yves herself and the NC cognescenti think of Yanis’s take.
I think Lambert linked to it in one of the water coolers, but this was during the comments holiday and so there was no opportunity for discussion.
I too think this is an interesting discussion topic.  Here is my brief “take” — I found YV’s argument slightly confusing, but perhaps what is confusing is DJT’s agenda, which may contain mutually incompatible elements.
1) YV thinks that DJT wants the USD to decline relative to other currencies in order to make US exports more attractive, and restrain imports.  From an early paragraph:
> But why blame this on the dollar’s global role? Because, Trump answers, foreign central banks do not let the dollar adjust downwards to the “right” level — at which US exports recover and imports are restrained. 
According to YV, DJT wants the USD to decline relative to other currencies but still remain the international reserve currency:
> Central to this new global order would be a cheaper dollar that remains the world’s reserve currency — this would lower US long-term borrowing rates even more. Can Trump have his cake (a hegemonic dollar and low-yielding US Treasuries) and eat it (a depreciated dollar)? He knows that the markets will never deliver this of their own accord. Only foreign central banks can do this for him. But to agree to do this, they need to be shocked into action first. And that’s where his tariffs come in.
 > his critics do not understand. They mistakenly think that he thinks that his tariffs will reduce America’s trade deficit on their own. He knows they will not. Their utility comes from their capacity to shock foreign central bankers into reducing domestic interest rates. Consequently, the euro, the yen and the renminbi will soften relative to the dollar. This will cancel out the price hikes of goods imported into the US, and leave the prices American consumers pay unaffected. The tariffed countries will be in effect paying for Trump’s tariffs.
At this point I am kind of confused. The (per YV) DJT-preferred foreign Central Bank policy will cause USD to appreciate relative to foreign currencies, offsetting the US tariffs. But surely this policy will make US exports even less attractive than they now are. US imports may not increase, but exports can, I would think, be expected to decrease. A larger trade deficit will (assuming the US domestic sector remains in the current balance/surplus/deficit level that it is in) result in larger Federal deficit (the sectoral balances identity).
YV thinks that DJT wants foreign CBs to subsequently intervene to appreciate their currencies (while holding their interest rates low)
> Acquiesce to what? To appreciating their currency substantially without liquidating their long-term dollar holding. He will not only expect each spoke to cut domestic interest rates, but will demand different things from different interlocutors.
Now I am really confused. I have the impression that international hot money flows happen in response to Central Bank interest rate changes. If foreign CBs have low rates, but want to appreciate their currencies relative to USD, what will the CBs do? Purchase their own currencies from private actors wanting to dump it? And pay with what? USD? Then the vast foreign USD holdings will be in the hands of private actors rather than CBs. Not sure that is a more stable arrangement than what now exists.
Superficially, this seems to me to be a difficult circle to square.
Read the original plan here:
https://www.hudsonbaycapital.com/documents/FG/hudsonbay/research/638199_A_Users_Guide_to_Restructuring_the_Global_Trading_System.pdf
They appear to be following this plan…probably at the stage right now of twisting arms (Canada, Mexico?) for the currency adjustment: appreciate your currency or get hit with tariffs (of course tariffs would cause those countries’ currencies to depreciate…so tariffs are not the best leverage there…but not sure the inconsistency bothers the Trump team)
It’s all a bit I misguided by faulty base assumptions (ie, that the US owes money to China/Japan, etc)…but that won’t stop these guys from trying it.  
It is interesting that they view America’s “Exorbitant privilege” in the post WW2 era as a curse rather than, well, a privilege.  In that view they have a point: the haves in the US benefitted greatly while the working class did not.  Some people in the US gained immense wealth; others lost their jobs.  It’s funny (and sad) that they are right now blaming rank and file Federal government employees for this rather than corporations and the ruling elites.
No one ever spares a thought for the Americans living abroad who are still tied to the USD for whom it’s tighten your belt time. Hey Elongelicals, while you’re in slashing mode ‘delete’ FATCA which doesn’t bother the wealthy US expats but certainly dumps on all the rest. The US certainly needs good ‘ambassadors’ abroad, which the large majority of her expats are…and she needs them now more than ever.
A note about electricity backups.  China has been constructing ultra-high voltage transmission lines for years.  I do not yet properly understand the mathematics, but China uses ultra-high voltage alternating and direct and “flexible direct” current to transmit electricity over long and very long distances with little loss of power along the route.  The point is to always have backups to electricity supplies.
Inspection and maintenance of the ultra-high voltage lines and support and conversion towers is done by robots and workers when necessary.
UHVDC is used for longer distances vs UHVAC is used for shorter distances.
UHVDC is more efficient than UHVAC but it costs more, so economics make more sense in longer distances.
The exact distances that determine which to use is somewhat flexible as best I can tell.
I don’t know exactly what they mean by flexible.  Maybe someone else can chime in.
My comment from yesterday about HVDC in the US:  https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2025/02/blackouts-are-becoming-the-norm-can-the-u-s-power-grid-be-saved.html#comment-4178837

China begins work on world’s first ultra-high voltage flexible direct current project
By Zheng Xin
The world’s first ultra-high voltage flexible direct current (UHVDC) transmission project has commenced construction on Monday, said its operator State Grid Corporation of China, the country’s largest power utility firm.
The project, the Gansu-Zhejiang ±800 kV UHVDC Transmission Project, will enable the transmission of over 36 billion kWh of electricity annually from Gansu to Zhejiang once completed, with more than half of this amount generated from renewable energy sources, it said.
Ultra-high voltage transmission lines refer to power transmission cables operating with greater than 800 kilovolts of direct current, or 1,000 kV of alternating current. Compared with traditional transmission lines, ultra-high voltage lines not only increase transmission capacity and extend transmission distances, but also reduce transmission losses.
The project, with a rated capacity of 8 million kilowatts and a total investment of about 35.3 billion yuan ($4.82 billion), passes through six provincial administrative regions, namely Gansu, the Ningxia Hui autonomous region, Shaanxi, Henan, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces, it said.
The project stretches for a total length of 2,370 kilometers, with converter stations being constructed in Wuwei, Gansu, and Shaoxing, Zhejiang.
The project will further facilitate the large-scale development and utilization of clean energy in Gansu, optimizing the region’s energy supply structure, and increasing the proportion of green electricity consumption…
re: Napoleon and color
Whilst the degrading of color is one aesthetic feature also due to modern re-coloring options via CGI it is a bit unfortunate to attach an ideological suspicion to Ridley Scott of all film directors. 
This treatment of colour has been his trademark for as long as he has been working with DOP Dariusz Wolski and well before. Just compare “Napoleon” to the other works like “Alien Covenant”, “Exodus”, “House of Gucci” or “The Last Duel”.
Dariusz Wolski list of movies:
https://www.imdb.com/de/name/nm0003011/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_0_nm_8_in_0_q_dariousz%2520wolski
Similiar characteristics can be observed with franchises like “Pirates of the Carribean” or “LOTR” and many more.
Besides R. Scott´s work was never known to be overly colourful. (“Gladiator”!?)
His brother Tony Scott (“Enemy of the State”, “Déjà Vu”) who too worked with Wolski (“Crimson Tide” “The Fan”) did share a few of the same colour palettes in the greys and blues I would guess whilst choosing overexposing with sunny spots and a certain sympathy for those “orange” filters we got accustomed to in the 1980/90s via the (in)fmaous array of Bruckheimer´s action flicks (most iconic of course with “Top Gun”  and “Days of Thunder” which might be one reason why they look so dated today.)

Just finished reading a lengthy, fascinating investigation of the linkages between Australian and Canadian promoters of nuclear power.
Excerpts:
On the face of it, Ontario is an odd part of the world on which to model Australia’s energy future. Privatization in both places has evolved messy, complicated energy grids, but that’s about all they have in common. One is a province on the sprawling North American landmass, and the other is a nation that spans a continent. Ontario has half the population of Australia and spends five months a year under ice. Its energy system has traditionally relied on hydro power and nuclear, where Australia is famously the driest inhabited continent on the planet that used to depend on coal but now boasts nearly 40% renewable electricity as of 2024. One Australian state, South Australia, already draws more than 70% of its power from renewables and frequently records weeks where all its electricity needs are met with solar and wind. Unlike Ontario, and the rest of Canada, Australia has no nuclear industry aside from a single research reactor in the Sydney suburbs. The cost of transmitting power over vast distances in Australia makes up approximately two-fifths of retail power prices. Electricity prices in Ontario, meanwhile, have been artificially lowered by an $7.3bn a year bundle of subsidies for households and businesses. Comparing the two jurisdictions is stranger than comparing apples and oranges; it’s more like comparing apples and maple syrup.
…
The initial price for Ontario’s new reactors, however, was offered before the design had been finished. As the cost is not fixed, any change to the design at any part of the process will up the cost as the plans are reworked. Professor M.V. Ramana, a physicist with the University of British Columbia and author of the book Nuclear is Not the Solution says this is standard for the industry – and a threat to the business that needs to be constantly managed. Even with market capitalizations of tens of billions of dollars, the publicly-owned utility companies most likely to invest in nuclear power take on considerable financial risk with any given project – a risk that only goes up as the price tag climbs through the billions. At some point, this risk hits a ceiling. Credit rating firms will threaten a downgrade, forcing the project to be abandoned to stop the financial destabilization of the company. In this way the nuclear business, Professor Ramana says, depends on the sunk cost fallacy.
“If you start off with a very high cost estimate, then there’s not much risk of it going up, because you’ve already padded it so much, right? But that’s not what these people are doing, because they know that once you say it will cost $20 billion, the government is going to say, ‘oh, we can’t afford that.’,” Ramana says.
“So the industry has to start small, tease people in, invite them into the game. And once they have put in a certain amount of money, once the ground has been dug, then you jack up the cost estimate, and they’re stuck.”
…
Within this convergence of pro-nuclear activism, internationalist conservative political ambition and new media ecosystems, companies within Canada’s nuclear industry have also been positioning themselves to take advantage should the prevailing wind change in Australia. In October 2024, Quebecois engineering services and nuclear company, AtkinsRéalis – the parent company of Candu Energy that now employs Ontario’s former energy minister, Todd Smith – announced it was opening a new Sydney office to “deliver critical infrastructure for Australians”.
Though little known in Australia, the company has a storied history in Canada. Formerly known as SNC-Lavalin, the Quebecois company changed name in 2023 in the long wake of a lingering corruption scandal involving allegations of political interference by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the justice system. Today the company holds an exclusive license to commercialize CANDU reactor technology through Candu Energy and in 2023 signed an agreement with Ontario Power Generation to help develop Canada’s first SMR reactor. A year later, the company signed a memorandum of understanding with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy to support the deployment of its BWRX-300 reactors in the UK.
In Australia nuclear power is like those nuclear subs we pay danegeld to the Yanks for, never going to happen without the Chinese doing it. Nuclear power boils water, so is a backwards step, waste heat is gong to wreck everything.
We are badly placed for storage here and like other countries our grid is getting shaky as the renewables lessen the inertia in the system. Those Canadian SMR’s will come in handy next century when the few remaining are sheltering in the limestone caves on the rim of the Great Australian Bight living on mushrooms and engineered sheep that live on the same mushrooms.

‘Brics broke up’: Trump claims bloc went silent after 150% tariff threat –  Business Standard
Has it fallen so far that it merits lower case letters?
Did you know that the price of college has been dropping? According to the Atlantic, it is true! 
I don’t know what data they’re relying on to make that statement. As a simple example, the cost for my kid to rent an office campus apartment is roughly 25% the cost of living on campus. We keep getting notices of price increases for tuition and fees too. We don’t pay full “sticker price” because my child has a number of scholarships. But those scholarships are compared to the full sticker price. We don’t get a reduction in cost. We get money to pay a higher fee.
With scholarships, the net cost of my BS degree, graduating in 2000, was roughly 20k$. The cost of my oldest to finish their degree next year will be 80k$. We’ll get the same degree from the same institution too, just 25 years apart. So, from my observation, the cost of college has quadrupled.
“Did you know that the price of college has been dropping?”
This is importantly incorrect.
The price of college (tuition and fees) has been increasing in every year for which there is data since 1979.  The college price has increased far faster than inflation and far faster than average family income:

Trump, the state and the revolution
By Branko Milanovic
To say that Trump in his new incarnation is different from the Trump No. 1 is to state the obvious. The world and the United States have been subjected to a deluge of decrees and decisions that have changed affairs internationally and domestically. It has been a three-week wild ride that does not seem to have run out of steam yet and has confirmed the idea that the new Trump will rule very differently from the old.
There are two reasons for this difference…
Good read, thanks for the link.
I did wonder about this passage:
It is sometimes derisively claimed that the revolutionaries want to destroy the “deep state” and then to argue that such a deep state does not exist in America. This is a naive objection that takes the meaning of the deep state in the way it was originally defined in Pakistan and Turkey (military establishment uncontrolled by the government). This indeed does not, or certainly does not fully, exist in the US.
Is this really correct?
Otherwise, I would agree that Trump and his “revolution” haven’t been going after the DS or even really the blobby parts of the USian state apparatus, at least not yet.
thanks Yves, Keens youtube completely vindicates my views on free trade. yes its free trade we live under now, as described by Bill Mitchel,
“as bill mitchell points out, yes its free trade. what is free trade? its unfettered capital.
https://billmitchell.org/blog/?p=34677
“the transnational movements of goods and services and capital flows.”
free trade is not government managed, 
“when a government enters into a free trade treaty, essentially they are entering into a treaty not with fellow sovereign countries, but with corporations.
under free trade, government no longer has sovereignty and democratic control. government is now subservient to capital, they now are the enforcers of free trade for capital.” 
these treaties are not written by government, they are written by corporations, and corporations dictate to governments, not the other way around.
and we know that free trade is almost completely corporate driven, that has gutted sovereignty, and has made government merely a enforcer for corporate free trade policies.”
Keen also points out what i point out, it was Bill Clinton. and when we speak about the economic conditions in the U.S.A. and the world, we should say B.C.(before Clinton), A.C. (after Clinton).
Agree: thanks for the Keen video. So nice to listen to a clear thinker!

Musk gives all federal workers 48 hours to explain what they did last week
NEW YORK (AP) — Hundreds of thousands of federal workers have little more than 48 hours to explain what they accomplished over the last week as part of billionaire Elon Musk’s crusade to slash what he describes as “waste everywhere” in the federal government.
“Consistent with President @realDonaldTrump’s instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,” Musk posted on X, which he owns. “Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.”
Shortly afterward, federal employees received a three-line email with this instruction: “Please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.”
The deadline to respond is Monday at 11:59 p.m. 
What a difference a week makes
168 little hours
Brought the inquisition
Where there used to be free rein
My yesterday was mine, dear
Today I’m a part of you, Elon
My rights are through, dear
Since you said you wanted a time line
What a difference a week makes
There’s an ultimatum before me
My answers can’t be stormy
Since that moment of hit or miss, that thrilling diss
It’s hell when you find bullet points on your menu
What a difference a week made
And the difference is you

The CIA could reply that they could tell Musk what they had been up to last week – but then they would have to kill him. You’re move, Elon.
All this makes me wonder if the Trumpsters have been reading Ian Welsh – 
“Let’s not dance around. Your first step will be to break the power of the current economic and political elites who are not willing to convincingly join you–or, at least, let you rule without trying to sabotage you.
You must do this all at once. When it happens, it has to happen to everyone to whom it is going to happen. This is Machiavelli’s dictum, and he was right. After it has happened, those who weren’t broken know they’re safe as long as they don’t get in your way.”
Sure seems like Trump learned something since his first term.  The Democrats continue to sit around with their thumps up their posteriors, having learned nothing.
They did manage to cobble together a survey:
Were you fired by President Trump? 
The Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, Democratic Staff, is surveying the impact of the Trump Administration’s mass firings of federal employees from science agencies. If you were terminated from your position since January 20, 2025, please fill out this brief survey.
And a sternly worded letter.
This resignation by inaction move is definitely out of Elon’s Twitter firing playbook.  I guess the next step is letting Bari Weiss plow through all the data that the DOGEbag bois harvested from IRS/USAID/etc. and declare it a victory for transparency.
The Democrats are more useless than the Syrian Arab Army.  Ditto the courts so far.
I found a really helpful summary of the legal issues surrounding this tweet and email:
What Just Happened: Musk-OPM Send Email to Federal Employees Asking for Five Accomplishments 
Could an agency treat an employee’s failure to respond to the OPM email as a resignation? 
No. The resignation of a federal employee must be voluntary. The Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) has stated that “[t]he touchstone of the analysis of whether a retirement or resignation is voluntary is whether the employee made an informed choice. A decision made ‘with blinders on,’ based on misinformation or lack of information, cannot be binding as a matter of fundamental fairness and due process.” 
A non-response to an email—especially an email with a deadline of one business day—does not evidence a “choice.” Moreover, a resignation must be requested by the employee—not the employer. The MSPB has jurisdiction to consider whether a resignation was, in fact, voluntary. I fully anticipate that the MSPB would not classify a removal pursuant to this email as a “voluntary resignation.” Were the Board somehow to fail to do so, the federal courts would likely overturn that decision.
Moreover, classifying a non-response as a resignation seeks to evade the civil service protections for performance-based firings. The MSPB lacks jurisdiction over issues arising from voluntary resignations except for determining whether the resignation was, in fact, voluntary. Yet employees removed from their position by the agency enjoy certain due process protections. The agency must provide notice and an opportunity for the employee to respond. The employee may then challenge their removal before the MSPB. The Trump administration cannot deprive employees of their due process rights through loopholes.
Internal divisions are occurring as Kash Patel has instructed employees to not reply to the email:
In a sign that not every Trump official is on the same page with Musk’s productivity inquiry, FBI Director Kash Patel has instructed employees to “pause any responses” to the email asking federal employees what they accomplished last week. Patel said the FBI will review the work of its own employees in accordance with its own procedures. 
State Department employees were similarly told not to respond to the email.
Ambassador Tibor P. Nagy said in an email to employees that the department would respond on employees’ behalf and that “no employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their Department chain of command.”

re: US economy 
JACOBIN

US Economic Decline Has Been Greatly Exaggerated
An interview with Sean Starrs 
A focus on GDP and national accounts gives a misleading picture of US economic power. In the age of globalization, production can be based in countries like China while most of the profits flow back to American firms, reinforcing US economic hegemony.
https://jacobin.com/2025/02/us-economic-decline-corporations-china
That is the level of stupidity that I come to expect from Jacobin.  It couldn’t be that the producers already realized the rent collecting American corporations can be bypassed by selling directly to the consumers (especially in the global South) at half or quarter of what American brands charge.
This guy has been pounding on the effects of the producer price advantage for the past year. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pWC1fF2CwNM
I’ve been watching some amazingly well made silent hiking videos from YouTube to sooth the nerves frayed by Trump 2.0 bulldozing through what’s left of the American way of life, such as it is.  https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7W4gdJrpgKI
These guys all use $1-2K DJI drones and the resulting 4K footage is incredible and merge seamlessly with their camera on tripod footage.  The results are so good that I’m seriously considering buying one to play with, even though I previously had zero interest in owning a drone.
In new tech field where Western firms did not previously have a firm foot hold, Chinese producers are already so dominant that alternatives don’t even register.  For older tech like computer chips and electric cars, trade barriers will only work for a little longer.  Then it’s all gone and it’s never coming back.

When Jaime Bortz was a teenager, she'd gently take hold of her dad's hand while they walked through the mall in Buffalo, New York. She'd guide him along to prevent him from getting lost, as if he were the child, she the parent.

        Then her dad, Steve Bortz, went to live in a nursing home. Jaime, a high schooler at the time, was embarrassed to tell her friends where her dad lived. She knew she never wanted to end up in a place like that.
    

        But time is making it harder for Jaime to live at home. She's 39 now. As the clock ticks on, the gaps in her brain widen, and she becomes more confused. Memories are rapidly slipping away, much as they did for her dad. She forgets how to dress herself, can't speak in full sentences, and cries a lot, perhaps because she's still aware enough to be frustrated by what's happening.
    

        Jaime's half-brother Todd went through this decline a decade ago. A father to three young kids at the time, he started forgetting how to drive his own bus route, often getting lost with passengers on board. In a matter of a few years, memories of who he married, what he liked to eat, and even his own shy nature were erased. He died of sepsis at 43. A year later, Todd's brother, Aaron, died at 40, with many of the same memory issues.
    

        Jaime, Todd, and Aaron all inherited a rare PSEN1 gene mutation from their father that guaranteed they'd develop Alzheimer's at a young age. They are members of an unlucky tribe, the 1% of people with dementia who have early-onset familial Alzheimer's.
    

        ""Even with the family history, no one believed that someone her age would have it,"" Bonnie Bortz, Jaime's mother and Steve's widow, told me when I visited her at home in Buffalo last year. By ""no one"" she meant friends, family, even some doctors.
    

        Bonniehas been a default caretaker at every turn. As a young mom, she handled Steve's decline. Years later, she helped Todd's wife, Michelle, go through it. Now 64, she's the anchor of a bustling household, caring for Jaime and her 9-year-old daughter.
    

        ""I am feeling desperate,"" Bonnie said. ""I try to stay optimistic and positive, and I just kind of put on a harder exterior — I have to do what I got to do to get everybody through.""
    

        Bonnie is foreshadowing the burden many families will soon experience. An article published in Nature Medicine in January suggests America is set to weather a cascade of dementia cases, a doubling of Alzheimer's patients by 2060. It predicts that by then, the country will gain 1 million new dementia patients each year.
    

        Families like the Bortzes are rare and warrant attention. There are just 45,000 cases like theirs worldwide. This small circle of people can offer researchers a glimpse into how Alzheimer's develops. Because they develop the first signs at early ages, researchers can separate the disease itself from other issues common among older people, like heart disease or type 2 diabetes. Early-onset cases have helped usher in a new class of Alzheimer's drugs, which have started to become available in recent years. While these antibody treatments don't cure the disease, they can slow its progression, buying families a little more time.
    

        Still, there is much to learn. Researchers don't understand what causes the disease. Ultimately, there probably isn't just one kind of Alzheimer's that can be fixed by one single prescription. Families like the Bortzes show how far researchers still have to go in understanding dementia and developing treatments.
    

        ""It's like cancer,"" Fred ""Rusty"" Gage, who researches dementia and neurodegenerative diseases at the Salk Institute, told Business Insider. ""This is not a single disease. There are different forms of it, and they're not just genetic forms versus nongenetic.""
    

        Bonnie knew something was wrong when Jaime moved back home in her early 30s. She kept forgetting her keys and phone and repeated herself a lot.
    

        ""The repeating of stories — that was definitely something my husband did,"" Bonnie said. ""And it was subtle, little things."" Jaime lost the insurance job she'd had for over a decade. Finally, around the time of Jaime's 36th birthday,they agreed it was time to get Jaime tested.
    

        The type of dementia that runs in the Bortz family is genetically preordained. Someone who inherits a genetic mutation from one of their parents will almost certainly develop dementia, progressively forgetting what they've learned over a lifetime. It generally starts with short-term memories, then expands to erase aspects of who they are and how they function. People with this early-onset genetic form of the disease suffer a much earlier and faster descent than people with ""regular,"" meaning sporadic, Alzheimer's.
    

        Gage says that to categorically separate nongenetic forms of Alzheimer's from the forms that families like the Bortzes have is naive. Each person's genetics shape their case. For example, roughly 60% of people who carry two copies of the APOE4 gene will develop Alzheimer's during their lifetime. (The actor Chris Hemsworth, who carries a copy of the gene from each of his parents, has been open about his ""4-4"" status.) Other folks, through some kind of genetic luck, can carry the same genes, and may even develop the amyloid plaques or tau tangles characteristic of Alzheimer's and yet never show signs of dementia. Of Steve's four children, only one did not develop his rare form of early dementia.
    

        ""There's dozens of genes that have been found to be associated with Alzheimer's disease,"" Gage said. Few of them single-handedly control a person's cognitive destiny. If most dementia diagnoses are colored in shades of gray, the Bortzes' cases are harshly black and white.
    

        In 2023, as life at the Bortzes' house was getting more difficult, new Alzheimer's drugs were starting to become available. The blockbuster was Leqembi, a Japanese drug brought to market in the US, designed to clear out the clumps of protein, or amyloid plaques, that form between brain cells in people with dementia.
    

        New drugs haven't been found to halt or prevent the disease, but data from one of Leqembi's clinical trials suggested it could slow progression down by about 27%. In practical terms, that means people might gain an extra four or five months of independence — of driving, perhaps, or cooking, shopping, dressing themselves, and remembering their families.
    

        ""The pessimist would look at the data as it stands and say: 'Well, we tried that. It obviously doesn't work very well, so maybe we should start looking at something else,'"" Gage said.
    

        Jaime was on early Medicare for her disability. Legally she was still allowed to drive, but her mom took her keys away after she failed a driving evaluation funded by the Alzheimer's Association. It was getting harder to remember daily minutia, like the fact that her daughter likes peanut butter toast now, or how to put a paper filter into a coffee maker.
    

        Still, Bonnie decided not to put Jaime on antibody drugs. She knew that they presented a small risk of brain bleeds and that Jaime, because she's a woman and because of her genetics, would be at a higher risk of developing them.
    

        ""I don't want to cause more problems,"" Bonnie said. In 2023, Jaime was developing some muscle jerks, prompted by one of the other medications she was on. ""I've never seen these medications help her in any way,"" Bonnie said. ""Not with memory, not with anything.""
    

        After years of focusing on drugs that target amyloid plaques, scientists are starting to try new tactics. More than 100 new Alzheimer's drugs are in later-stage clinical trials. If those trials are successful, the drugs could become available to patients in the next couple of years. They include therapies designed to target neuronal tau tangles, which pulverize and kill brain cells from the inside, and others that go after the inflammation tied to Alzheimer's. Increasingly, doctors are wondering whether the anti-inflammatory effects of GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic and Mounjaro may prove effective against dementia.
    

        ""I would hope that we'd get to a good point where we look at where you are in the disease and we can fine-tune a cocktail,"" said Lindsay Hohsfield, an Alzheimer's researcher and associate professor at the University of California, Irvine, who cofounded a nonprofit called Youngtimers to support families like the Bortzes.
    

        Jaime's condition has progressed dramatically over the past year. When I visited her at home in snowy Buffalo in early 2024, it was harder to tell something was amiss. She could carry on a simple conversation, exchanging pleasantries with a new houseguest — but if you spent more than a few minutes with her, you might notice her start to repeat questions (""Where do you live again?"") or variations of them. Sometimes, she'd nod and quickly backtrack, insisting she already knew.
    

        Reminiscing about old memories, like her favorite '90s TV shows or her pink prom dress, was much easier than recalling newly acquired information.
    

        I asked how her speech therapy was going, and she turned to her mom blankly. I can't know what was going on in her mind, but it seemed like she was scanning our faces for hints about how to answer and where the conversation should go next. Bonnie sensed the difference in her daughter, in the way a mother can.
    

        Later, sitting with me in the privacy of her SUV, Bonnie pointed out Jaime's repetition. That, she told me, is what it's like everyday.
    

        Bonnie's been there through it all, managing the appointments, fighting to get Medicare payments, and evaluating which drugs and treatments to put her daughter on and which to skip. Driving often gives her some of her few solo moments of the day. She relishes going to work, rare time by herself. Recently she hired Michelle, Todd's wife, as an aide — a familiar face who can come help take care of Jaime for about 10 hours a week.
    

        Bonnie tries to keep thoughts of the future to a minimum. Jaime's asked her, many times, not to put her in a nursing home.
    

        ""I pray to God it doesn't get to that point, because I would hate to do that to my daughter,"" she said. ""With that being said, I am older. I don't know. I just, I don't know.""
    

        Bonnie doesn't know how Jaime's condition will develop and what kind of support she'll require. Jaime has told Bonnie that her biggest fears are the nursing home and death.
    

        ""The difficult thing about Alzheimer's, all brain diseases, if you truly wanted to reverse, you would also not only have to clear out disease, you'd actually have to build the brain back,"" said Dr. Nathaniel Chin, the medical director at the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. ""This is not an infection where if you identify it, you kill it, you go back to being yourself. I mean, the disease has destroyed parts of your brain.""
    

        Bonnie understands there's not much you can do to stop this disease. That doesn't stop her from being a mom — from trying to do something, anything, to help her daughter.
    

        A man sometimes comes to her house for 10-minute sessions of cold laser therapy, designed to nourish and energize Jaime's cells.
    

        ""They're not working,"" Bonnie tells me, laughing out loud, probably realizing how ridiculous it sounds. Still, there's a quiet optimism. ""Part of me is like, well, maybe we should keep trying, you know? As a mom.""
    

        Recently Bonnie joined an online support group for families with early-onset familial Alzheimer's. There she got sucked into another tantalizing promise that a product could somehow help Jaime. She ended up sending about $600 to a man offering specialty herbal supplements before she realized he'd never send her any medicine.
    

        ""You get yourself suckered in because you want to believe that there's something out there,"" Bonnie said. She's also ordered expensive memory supplements advertised on TV.
    

        In a moment of desperation, while Todd was in decline in the early 2010s, Michelle sent a letter to Dr. Phil, begging for his help. Maybe this wasn't really Alzheimer's, she wrote. Maybe, hopefully, it was some other rare, undiagnosed condition that could be cured once it could be properly identified. ""It sounds stupid, but I see that he does all these different testings,"" she said. Deep down, she knew she wouldn't hear back, and knew he wouldn't be able to help. Still, she's contacted Dr. Phil a few times since then, including once recently, worrying about what's in store for the next generation of the family.
    

        The throughline is a flicker of hope. Isn't there something that can help?
    

        Before Jaime's diagnosis, Bonnie was considering moving out of the house where she'd raised her kids and into a smaller home, enjoying a new empty nest. Now her old nest is full of boisterous daily activity again.
    

        Jaime is the last of her generation going through this rapid, fatal decline, but her young daughter is sometimes angry and embarrassed about her mom's condition. She lashes out — a kid grappling with losing pieces of her mother, one day at a time.
    

        Michelle's 20-year-old daughter, Emma, wonders whether she should get tested before deciding whether she wants to have her own children. New genetic tests, in conjunction with IVF, are allowing some people with familial Alzheimer's to choose embryos to implant that don't carry the genetic mutation.
    

        ""I want to know, but then I don't want to know — I don't want to be worried about it all the time,"" Emma said. ""It just should be taken out of the gene pool, probably. I don't want to do that to my kids.""

35,2025-02-22,"Residents fear being priced out of a Suffolk town due to the construction of a nuclear power plant, with the rent on some homes doubling to more than £3,000 a month.
A final investment decision on Sizewell C is expected within months and groundwork is already under way.
Its construction is predicted to require a workforce of 7,900 people, with about two thirds moving from outside the area, and some people in nearby Leiston have claimed ""landlords are cashing in"" by raising rents.
Linda Druce, director and founder of Druce Estate & Letting Agents, said: ""I have been in the area for 21 years now and this is the first time we have seen such a significant jump, particularly in rental prices.""
Leiston, located between the more affluent coastal towns of Aldeburgh and Southwold, had traditionally been viewed as a more affordable place to live.
But one sales negotiator, who did not want to be named, said family homes in the area that were normally rented for £1,500 a month were now costing as much as £3,000.
It is a claim which was corroborated by Ms Druce.
""It is mainly because of Sizewell C contractors and those looking to be working here over the next year or two who are looking to rent,"" she said.
""The core of our clients are not likely to jump into wanting to get higher rents but we are seeing more people from out of the area who are buying buy-to-let properties.
""And quite frankly the local people who own them are more than happy to sell to the highest and best bidder.""
One of the family homes with a rent of £3,000 a month - a fee which includes bills and cleaning costs - is a three bedroom semi-detached property in Carr Avenue. 
The home, which is being let by Hamilton Smith estate agents, has two bathrooms and is described as being fully furnished and ""beautifully presented"".
Luke Vale, who owns Hamilton Smith, described the situation in the town as a ""housing concern"".
""Although that property is being marketed through us and to a particular set of clientele, we are still actively trying to look after our current clients,"" he said. 
""We look after hundreds of properties in Leiston. I am having to deal with tenants who are terrified that their landlords are going to kick them out just so they can go down this route to make more money.
""But that doesn't factor in the number of landlords we have who do not want to increase their rent and are actually really good.
""The problem is a lot of landlords see pound signs and then the floodgates open and so, at the moment, if I put a house up for sale in Leiston, nine times out of 10 the viewing will be with someone who wants to buy it and rent it out per room.""
Elsewhere in the town, another three-bedroom home is being advertised at a cost of £3,100 a month including bills, while a two-bedroom apartment is being let at a rate of £3,045 a month, including utility bills. 
The current cost of renting in the area has raised eyebrows, not least given the average rent in Leiston is £773, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Sizewell C said 2,400 of the workers at the new power station will be based on site, while 500 others will live at Pontins Pakefield, near Lowestoft.
The remaining contractors, however, will have to move into local properties.
Alison Downes, from the campaign group Stop Sizewell C, said: ""If Sizewell C goes ahead thousands more workers from outside the area will need accommodation and if those numbers increase, like at Hinkley Point C, where they are going up to a staggering 15,000, the people of Leiston will face many years more pain.""
It is not just landlords who could capitalise on the influx of workers heading into the area.
Residents in Leiston who have spare rooms or spaces can apply to East Suffolk Council for a Sizewell C Housing Grant, which range from £3,000 to £7,000, as the authority looks to provide an additional 1,200 bed spaces during the construction. 
""[These] provide funding to help local people bring latent accommodation back into use or upgrade their spare rooms to rent for extra income at a time when the cost of living is still a real challenge for a lot of people,"" said a Sizewell C spokesperson.
Despite this, the suggestion Sizewell C could be driving up prices does not sit well with tenants who currently live in the area.
Louise Smith, 54, said it was ""unfair"" local people might no longer be able to afford to live in Leiston ""because of Sizewell"".
She added: ""The rents will go up and up and up because everyone is jumping on the bandwagon and the landlords are cashing in on it.
""They can just pick a figure out of the air and demand what they like because Mr Bloggs over there can pay that and Mr Smith over there can't.
""It's a shame but money talks.""
According to the ONS, 79.1% of people in East Suffolk are in paid work or have a job, with the average weekly wage being £604, which equates to a £29,596 salary for someone who works 49 weeks in a year.
Wenge Yuan, 58, has lived in Leiston for over three years and is one of those who is concerned about the rent increases.
He said: ""When we leave, our landlord has told us he will raise the price significantly because the environment has changed.
""There are a lot more workers coming here and the market is going up and getting hot.
""It's not good news for the people who need to rent and it is going to get more challenging to live here.""
John Steven, 72, said he moved into a flat in Leiston in 2019 but had to leave when his landlord sold the property.
""When I moved here my rent was £625 a month but now that same flat is being rented out with bills for at least £1,500, and I believe that is because of Sizewell,"" he said.
""I know of a lady on her own who wants to find somewhere in Leiston but it is just impossible and the rates are going right up.
""It's not fair on the people who live here and if anyone wanted to come to Leiston it would be impossible to make a life here - I couldn't afford what they are charging.
""Those who don't work for Sizewell are being farmed out of the area. If my landlord decided to sell, I haven't got a clue where I would go.""
Steven Grant, 60, said: ""We do need nuclear power but unfortunately the rents are going up in this area and it is going to be a nightmare.
""You haven't got a chance now so you might as well give up and just deal with it. What are you going to do? It's done.""
Leiston is known for once being a thriving manufacturing town, and the highly acclaimed Long Shop Museum and the town's film theatre are two of the draws for visitors.
Sizewell C, which is partly funded by EDF, said it would support up to 70,000 jobs and provide energy for about six million homes for 60 years.
In December, Sizewell C, in which the government has an 85% stake, also launched 35 new apprenticeships - the first of nearly 100 new early careers roles that will eventually become available on the project.
Those behind the site said they were working ""closely with the housing team at East Suffolk Council"" to ensure ""there's no negative impacts"" on the private housing sector and to the local area, including to the 5,508 people who live in Leiston.

This included both parties signing a Deed of Obligation and an Accommodation Working Group being formed to oversee the impacts of the workforce on the local housing market from now until the end of the construction period. 
A spokesperson from East Suffolk Council added: ""We recognise this has the potential to impact on local residents.
""While we have limited control over individual rents charged by private landlords, we will continue to work with Sizewell C, Suffolk County Council and the wider community to mitigate impacts.""

Adarsh Pandit recently introduced me to the concept of the “gentleman scientist”: a researcher who funds their work independently. After digging around a bit, I was fascinated to learn that independent researchers were fairly common in the 18th and 19th centuries.
Many researchers were personally wealthy or had access to deep pockets. Charles Darwin pursued scientific collection as a hobby, and his first voyage on HMS Beagle was funded by his family. James Prescott Joule, after whom the joule is named, was “scientifically self-taught”, doing research in his off-hours at the family brewery. And in the 1930s, Alfred Lee Loomis used his Wall Street wealth to start a laboratory in his mansion, nicknamed “The Palace of Science”, where physicists like Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, and Enrico Fermi collaborated.
These days, if you say you work in research, most people assume you work in academia. But it’s sort of odd that we assume you need someone’s permission to do research. There’s no reason that universities need to be the gatekeepers of exploring and developing new ideas.
Sometimes, a lack of training can produce even more interesting results. I was reminded of this recently after hearing a talk by Charles Mann, author of The Wizard and the Prophet. He told the story of Norman Borlaug, an agronomist who developed disease-resistant wheat varieties that are estimated to have prevented over half a billion deaths worldwide. Because Borlaug lacked formal training, he made the mistake of engaging in “shuttle breeding”: transporting wheat to multiple climates to speed up their breeding season. Researchers at the time widely believed this was wrong. But Borlaug, in his naïvete, ended up not only disproving the theory, but accidentally producing wheat varieties that adapted to environments with varying amounts of sunlight.
While reading about independent researchers, I found a 1998 Science article (paywalled here), called “Scientists Who Fund Themselves”, profiling several contemporary researchers who fund their own work.
Interestingly, many of them asked to remain anonymous, partly because they didn’t want people to know they were wealthy, and partly, it seems, because it carried a hint of embarrassment. It’s better to say you’re funded by a big institutional grant than to admit it’s coming out of your savings account.
This is the dark side of independent research. Without external validation - “I teach at Stanford” or “I got a grant from NASA”, it’s hard to convince people that you’re any good at what you do. The same goes for your output: you want peers to acknowledge and review your work, or the signoff of a well-respected journal.
I understand, then, why researchers flock to the safety of institutions. Imagine studying something that nobody else is studying, for reasons you can’t really articulate, without knowing what the outcome of your work will be. For the truly obsessed person, the need for validation isn’t about ego; it’s about sanity. You want to know there’s some meaning behind the dizzying mental labyrinth that you simultaneously can’t escape and also never want to leave.
And yet, independence seems to afford a level of risk and intellectual freedom that every researcher dreams of:
Fifteen years ago, this researcher, then in his late 40s, considered dropping out of science. “I was always well funded,” says the researcher, who asked that his name not be used. “I just disliked the process very much. It finally reached the point, sort of my midlife crisis, where I realized I was spending 60 hours a week in the lab, and spending less than 15 doing what I wanted to do.” Then he slyly grins as he tells the story of how he escaped from the grind that has become modern science: He decided to use his modest savings to play stock markets around the world. Now, he runs a sprawling lab at a major research university, and he funds most of the work himself….“I do science because I enjoy doing science … I don’t want to be forced to justify what I’m doing because it makes better air in submarines, or whatever,” he says.
While historic examples of “gentleman scientists” seem to refer to people who were wealthy, independent research doesn’t have to be expensive (depending, of course, on your field). Science interviewed Duke University’s Steven Vogel, who studied biological fluid mechanics:
“If I had $1000 a year to spend on research, I’d be in clover,” says Vogel. “I ask questions like, How do leaves on trees respond to wind? My expenses can be two rolls of film.”
Speaking from my own experience, funding opportunities are often hiding in plain sight, or can be cobbled together from a number of places. I funded my initial research with a grant from the Ford Foundation, without any prior connections or RFPs. We found each other through someone I’d cold emailed. The grants weren’t big, but they were enough, carrying me through the following year until I joined GitHub.
Institutions can also help enable more independent research. I’m lucky to have found an organization, Protocol Labs, that funds research in all sorts of unusual ways. Having tried this both ways, I can say that having a steady salary (and health insurance!) allows me to do much better work than when I was worried about my next source of funding. Likewise, Harvard generously provided me with tools that an independent researcher wouldn’t otherwise get, such as access to their library and resources. Organizations can still provide this type of support, and the benefit of collaborating with likeminded peers, without requiring a formal entry into academia.
My first go at independent research wasn’t necessarily easy. I didn’t know independent research was a viable path, and especially not in Silicon Valley, land of builders and shippers. I didn’t know whether I was doing something useful with my time, or whether I was just a crazy person.
A few years later, I’ve realized that the answer to that question doesn’t really matter. Life is short. Do whatever you can’t stop thinking about. Documenting your findings in public (regardless of outcomes!) is a worthy contribution to society, full stop. If you’re doing something new, and you care about understanding the problem, people will pay attention. What’s more, they’ll take your ideas and make them better than you’d ever imagined. And that style of research - living in service to the public - starts to look very different from the bloated, ivory tower models we’ve been accustomed to.
As we develop new ways of funding creative work, via Patreon or actual patrons, I would love to see more people consider independent research. You don’t need a PhD to study something you care about. You don’t need to publish papers in academic journals to become widely respected. You just need a curious mind, a bankroll, and a commitment to learning in public. Producing work that makes other people think, and perhaps change their behavior, is the validation, and it’s enormously satisfying.
I hope more people are inspired to take a leap of faith and pursue the lines of inquiry that consume them. And I hope we’ll see other patrons and organizations stepping up to fund them.

Cybercriminals are sending fake meeting invitations that seem legitimate.
Cold calls are often a waste of your time and an unwanted interruption to your day. You might think that, at worst, you end up buying or signing up for something that you don't really need or at an inflated price. But there's a lot worse that could happen. 
The line between spam and scam calls is often thin and blurred. The person on the other end of the call might sound like they're trying to sell you something or conduct a survey, but this could just be a cover for them to try to extract personal information from you. 
Personal information that they can then use to target you with an extremely convincing scam down the line or to gain direct access to your accounts.
STAY SAFE & IN THE KNOW — AT NO COST! SUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S THE CYBERGUY REPORT FOR FREE SECURITY ALERTS & TECH TIPS

HOW TO STOP ANNOYING ROBOCALLS
Take security questions, for example. They're pretty repetitive: your mother's maiden name, your first pet's name, your favorite elementary school teacher. A hacker does not need to know how to script a single line of code to break into your accounts; it's often enough that they know these things about you and can convince your mobile carrier to activate a SIM card in your name. 
This is all, let's not mince words, scary, especially if you've just sold a vehicle or property and have the proceeds lying around or a nest egg account set aside for your retirement, because scammers and hackers can easily find out about title or deed transfers through data brokers like people finder sites.
Scary as it is, it's also simple to protect against. Simple, but not always easy. If you just refuse to engage with these people, never giving up even a scrap of information, your risks of getting scammed or hacked plummet. Keep your personal information out of circulation in the first place (using a data removal service, for example), and they drop to almost zero.

HOW TO GET RID OF ROBOCALLS WITH APPS AND DATA REMOVAL SERVICES
So, once faced with a suspicious call, the solution is simply to hang up as soon as something seems off. And when is that, exactly? The moment someone calls you out of the blue and requires you to give or confirm any personal information. This could be the last four digits of your Social Security number, your address, which credit card company you're with — anything that concerns you, specifically. If the caller turns up the pressure and starts trying to get you to stay on the line, either by enticing you with ""rewards"" or even threatening you with dire consequences, then you can be absolutely sure the call is not legitimate. 
WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?
But what if the call is legitimate? What if you hang up on someone who was only doing their job? What if they were truly trying to help you? These are the doubts that scammers and hackers play upon to ply their trades. We're all vulnerable to tactics like these, especially if caught off guard. Older adults are particularly vulnerable. Studies suggest that older people — who collectively lose over $28 billion to scams each year — are more likely to cling to initial impressions of trustworthiness, even when later behavior puts that trustworthiness into question. Scammers typically start their interactions with well-rehearsed, smoothly executed preambles, creating good first impressions. Older people are also more likely to put stock in good manners, finding it more difficult than younger adults to directly or indirectly question a caller's intentions, let alone cut them off mid-sentence and hang up on them.

TOP 10 ROBOCALL HOTSPOTS IN AMERICA
So, how can you know if the caller is really who they say they are? That's the question many people get stuck on. The twist? It's a red herring. The fact is, it doesn't matter if the call is legit or not. If it's a scammer, they won't be hurt or offended: rejection and hang-ups come with the territory. If it's a real call, the caller also won't be hurt or offended — here's why. Call center staff and other people who make cold calls as part of their job are aware of the privacy and security concerns that such calls bring up. They know how dangerous it can be to divulge personal information over the phone, which is why they won't ask for it. They should also be familiar with one of the best practices there is for dealing with suspicious cold calls.
1. Use the ""Hang up, look up, and call back"" method for verification: When in doubt, hang up the phone, look up the organization the caller claimed to be calling from (using its official website, for example), and call it back using the number you find there. If the call you received was above board, they'll be able to redirect you back to the initial caller.
2. Don't answer calls from unknown numbers: Let unknown calls go to voicemail, as legitimate callers will usually leave a message if it's important.
3. Register your phone number on the National Do Not Call Registry: This can help reduce telemarketing calls from legitimate businesses, but it won't stop scammers, illegal robocalls or exempt organizations (like charities and political groups) from calling you. Scammers often ignore the registry and use tactics like number spoofing to bypass it. Want to know more about why your phone still won’t stop ringing and what you can do about it? Check out our article on the ‘Do Not Call’ list loophole.

4. Use a spam blocking app for texts and calls: These apps can identify and block known spam numbers, significantly reducing the number of unwanted calls you receive.
5. Never give out personal information in response to unexpected calls: Legitimate organizations won't ask for sensitive information over the phone if they've initiated the call.
6. Be cautious of pressure tactics or requests for immediate action: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to prevent you from thinking clearly or verifying their claims.
7. Set a password for your voicemail account: This prevents scammers from accessing your voicemail and potentially gathering personal information.
8. Be wary of caller ID spoofing — local numbers may not be local callers: Scammers can manipulate caller ID to display any number they choose, so don't trust it blindly.
9. Don't respond to questions, especially those that can be answered with ""Yes"": Scammers may record your ""Yes"" response and use it to authorize fraudulent charges or changes to your accounts.
10. Invest in personal data removal services: To get fewer of these calls in the first place, you can enlist the help of a professional data removal service. These services can take your personal information out of circulation, including the contact details spammers and scammers use to call you. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here. 
IDENTIFY ANY MYSTERY CALLER FOR FREE WITH THIS PHONE NUMBER LOOKUP TOOL
If you receive a call that gives you any doubts at all, even if you can't quite put your finger on why, then you should end the call and either go on with your day or look up the company and call it back on its official number. You can reduce the number of calls like this by signing up for a data removal service. This will leave fewer spam and scam callers with your contact details and other personal information — something they use to craft convincing backstories and put potential victims at ease.

	Lee, Buck Mason, and Midland singer Mark Wystrach might be the most stylish posse in menswear.

	The LA-based label and the iconic denim brand recently joined forces for a six-piece capsule, enlisting Wystrach to star as the face of the release. The collection marries Lee’s American heritage to Buck Mason’s mid-century California style in jeans, suede and denim jackets, and bandanas. Priced between $128 and $898, the capsule is available now on both retailers’ websites while supplies last (some pieces are already selling out).

	The capsule’s campaign imagery sees Wystrach recreating “the golden days of Hollywood” when rugged actors wore Lee jeans both on and off-screen.

	“Lee is such a big piece of the puzzle when it comes to American denim and workwear,” said Kyle Fitzgibbons, chief creative officer at Buck Mason. “The 1940s, specifically, that’s when we saw the first version of the 101 in modern form. The influence those jeans had on American culture from that point forward, it informs so much of what we do at Buck Mason today. It was like a dream for us, getting to connect those dots.”



	One of the collection’s standout pieces is the 91-B jacket made using Buck Mason’s Rambler Suede, which is made to look straight out of the Sixties or Seventies. We’re also big fans of the denim jacket and jeans, which are both made using loomstate selvedge denim. The jacket boasts unique details like Lee’s distinctive zig-zag stitch placket, while the jeans feature a classic straight fit.



	“The Buck Mason team does an incredible job with storytelling, and we’re thrilled to have Mark in this campaign,” said Brigid Stevens, global vice president of marketing at Lee. “The images do a great job paying tribute to the capsule’s historic inspiration while remaining true to the Lee of today.”

Technology-enhanced toys are redefining playtime, seamlessly integrating advanced features that captivate and engage today’s tech-savvy generation. AI-powered companions offer personalized interactions, adapting to a child’s learning style and providing customized feedback. Remote-controlled gadgets, from miniature vehicles to sophisticated drones, encourage exploration and spatial reasoning. These innovations transform traditional play into dynamic, interactive experiences, fostering creativity, problem-solving skills, and a deeper understanding of technology’s potential in the world around them.


The musicBOT is a humanoid robot that functions as a Bluetooth speaker, offering an interactive music experience for children. It features a dot matrix face that displays various expressions and can connect with other musicBOTs to foster social interaction. While not technologically groundbreaking, the musicBOT enhances music engagement by combining play with listening, helping kids form a deeper, more personal connection with music.
Classic toys are experiencing a vibrant resurgence, reimagined with contemporary materials and innovative designs that appeal to a new generation of players. Traditional building blocks are now crafted from sustainable wood and infused with magnetic connectors, while board games incorporate augmented reality elements for immersive storytelling. These updated classics offer a comforting blend of nostalgia and modern aesthetics, providing a screen-free alternative that fosters creativity, social interaction, and imaginative play, proving that timeless fun never goes out of style.

49,2025-02-22,"California Governor Gavin Newsom this week recommended former Apple CEO Steve Jobs for the $1 American Innovation Coin for the State of California that will be minted by the U.S. Mint.
Each state is able to create a unique coin recognizing an innovation or innovator from their region as part of the Innovation Coin Program that was launched in 2018.
Newsom said that Steve Jobs ""encapsulates the unique brand of innovation that California runs on.""
Jobs' legacy spans industries and products: Jobs was the co-founder and CEO of Pixar Animation Studios, bringing to life the world's first fully computer-animated feature: ""Toy Story."" But even that legacy-defining achievement is surpassed by his work as co-founder and two-time CEO of Apple, launching several revolutionary computers, including Apple II - the first mass-produced microcomputer - and Macintosh - the first mass-market personal computer that included a graphic display, so users could see what they were working on.
The goal, according to Jobs, was to ""bridge the gap between sophisticated technology and 'the rest of us' who make up most of humanity...to make complex technology easy to use and fun to use."" That approach led to the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, devices that refined existing technology to make it more precise, more intuitive, and more functional.
By focusing on who he was innovating for - other people - Jobs was able to use technology to connect people to each other and to the broader world, bringing people onto the same level by providing them with equal access. And that approach was built on a willingness to try new ideas and push the boundaries of what was possible - an approach that embodies the California spirit.
California's nomination has been presented to the Citizens Coinage Advisory Committee (CCAC), which will take design recommendations to the Treasury Secretary for final approval. The CCAC decided to recommend a coin with Steve Jobs in his iconic turtleneck and glasses, but the design is not finalized and could be updated before the coin is made.
The coin is expected to be produced and made available in 2026.

What makes a great Android interface? A few things immediately come to mind. It should be fast, reliable, feature-rich, and easy to use. In 2025, just about every option checks these boxes. As Android has matured, finding an outright bad Android UI is virtually impossible.
This means that standing out from the crowd is more difficult than ever. Even so, that’s precisely what OnePlus has managed to do with its latest build of OxygenOS. Since late December, I’ve used a OnePlus 13 with OxygenOS 15 as my daily Android phone. During that time, I’ve been thoroughly impressed with OnePlus’s software.
OxygenOS 15 isn’t drastically different from skins on Google, Samsung, or other Android phones. However, a handful of small yet meaningful decisions have catapulted it to the Android interface I prefer more than anything else. Here’s why.
OnePlus makes a big deal about the smoothness and responsiveness of OxygenOS 15. A really, really big deal. A large chunk of the company’s OxygenOS 15 landing page is dedicated to it, talking about how much smaller OxygenOS 15 is compared to OxygenOS 14 (20%, to be exact) and showing multiple animations of apps opening and closing to drive the point home.
It’s all a bit silly, but having used OxygenOS 15 for the last few weeks, OnePlus is right to be proud of it.
Just like there aren’t any bad Android interfaces in 2025, there aren’t any flagship Android phones that are slow or sluggish. Modern chipsets have reached a point where all flagships — and even most mid-rangers — are quick and responsive. Even so, OxygenOS 15 on the OnePlus 13 has stood out as something special.
It’s difficult to describe in writing, but there’s a sense of fluidness to OxygenOS 15 that I don’t notice in One UI 7 or Google’s Pixel software. All of them are fast, but OxygenOS 15 feels quicker and more responsive to my touch. I think this is also helped by the excellent animations throughout the OS. Whether it’s the way apps expand/shrink from a folder or how the Quick Settings gently bounce down from the top of the screen, it strikes a fantastic balance of good, fast visuals that don’t appear sluggish or heavy.
If you’ve used OxygenOS 15, you know what I’m talking about. If you haven’t, I’d encourage you to do so. Once you do and get used to how the interface feels, it’s difficult to go back to something else.
Multitasking has long been one of the clear differentiators between Android and iOS. Android phones have allowed you to run multiple apps side-by-side for years, while even the iPhone 16 series lacks this basic functionality.
But I have a confession: I hate multitasking on most Android phones. I appreciate the versatility, but using two cramped versions of my apps on top of each other isn’t a good experience. That said, I love multitasking on OxygenOS 15, and that’s because of Open Canvas.
When you’re in an app and want to start multitasking, you launch Open Canvas by swiping up on the screen with three fingers. This pushes your app to the top of the screen and brings you back to your home screen, allowing you to pick the second app you want to open.
You can use each app in a 50/50 split if you prefer, but the real magic of Open Canvas is the ability to shrink one of the apps so that it’s mostly out of view. This shows one of your apps nearly in full screen while your other one is floating above or below it. When you tap the hidden app, it instantly pops into full view and shrinks the other one.
This is how multitasking should be. I get the convenience of having two apps right at my fingertips, but I don’t have to use them in shrunken, cramped windows. It’s particularly useful when I’m doing something like paying bills and want to quickly jump back and forth between my banking app and my credit card app. Open Canvas has completely ruined all other forms of multitasking for me, and it’s a big reason why OxygenOS is now my Android interface of choice.
I’m a sucker for good customization. It’s one of the reasons so many of us choose Android over iOS, and it’s been a bedrock of Android since its inception. However, many modern Android skins are lacking in this department. Google’s Pixel interface is a bit too rigid for my liking, and while One UI is much more flexible, not all of it is fun to interact with (I’m looking at you, Galaxy Themes).
OxygenOS, meanwhile, gets everything right. Right out of the box, you can change app icons (system-wide or individually), accent colors, fingerprint animations, home screen transition animations, Quick Settings tile shapes, and more.
It’s an incredible level of adjustment, and it’s all easy to use, too. It reminds me of how customizable most Android interfaces were a few years ago in the best way possible. This is how customization should be on all Android phones, and it’s another reason why OxygenOS has stood out to me.
Similarly, OxygenOS 15’s overall style just works. It’s more heavily customized than “stock” Android but not nearly as over-the-top as One UI. Between the Quick Settings, app drawer, Settings layout, and stock apps like the Calculator and Clock, I think it all strikes a really nice balance. I find this especially true having started using the Samsung Galaxy S25 recently. It’s a good phone! It’s fast, the screen looks great, and there are tons of settings to play with. But I don’t love how One UI looks, and it puts a damper on things for me.
Every smartphone has AI in 2025. Whether it’s a Samsung Galaxy, a Google Pixel, or even an iPhone, there’s no escaping the onslaught of mobile AI features. It’s a shame, too, because almost all of them are somewhat convenient at best and downright bad at worst.
OxygenOS 15 has its own share of AI features, too, and they’re largely what we’ve come to expect. There are AI photo tools for erasing reflections and fixing blurry images, AI writing tone adjustment and formatting tricks in the Notes app, real-time AI screen translation, and AI-assisted replies to text messages.
The features are there if you want to use them, but unlike some Android interfaces, OnePlus has hidden them from sight if — like me — you don’t care about them. For example, AI Reply and AI Screen Translator are only accessible from the Smart Sidebar, which can be completely disabled via the Settings app.
It’s a night-and-day approach from something like One UI 7, which seems all too eager to throw AI in your face any chance it gets. Between the AI writing tools icon on the Samsung Keyboard, the dedicated Galaxy AI settings page, and new features like Now Brief on the Galaxy S25 series, it often feels like there’s no escaping Samsung’s AI future.
OnePlus seems to better understand that not everyone is ready to jump aboard the AI bandwagon. Maybe the company is also self-aware that its AI features are a bit niche for most users. Whatever the case, I vastly prefer OnePlus’s lighter approach here. I’m not sure if it’ll continue with future OxygenOS iterations, but at least in OxygenOS 15, it feels tame and in control.
OxygenOS was in a rough place a couple of years ago. OxygenOS 13 was one of the most significant updates to the interface in years, and not all of it worked. It was cluttered, heavy, and had lost much of what made previous iterations so good.
OnePlus got on the right track with OxygenOS 14, and OxygenOS 15 feels like what the company has been working toward for the last couple of years. It checks every box I look for, and unless something drastic changes, it’ll be my Android skin of choice going forward."
55,2025-02-22,"The US state of Florida has sued supermarket giant Target, accusing it of misleading investors and causing financial losses by promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.
Attorney General James Uthmeier filed the lawsuit in federal court in Fort Myers on Thursday, claiming that Target failed to disclose the potential financial risks associated with its DEI policies, thereby misleading investors.
The lawsuit also alleges that Target’s DEI efforts, including its 2023 Pride Month campaign, contributed to consumer backlash and boycotts. It claims that this reaction led to a decline in the company’s stock value and a loss of more than $25 billion in market capitalization.
“Corporations that push radical leftist ideology at the expense of financial returns jeopardize the retirement security of Florida’s first responders and teachers,” Uthmeier said. He stressed that his office will pursue corporate reform so that “companies get back to the business of doing business – not offensive political theatre.”
Target has faced at least three similar lawsuits in Florida, all accusing the company of violating securities laws by not informing investors about the potential financial impact of its DEI initiatives. The company announced in January that it would scale back several DEI programs, including those supporting black employees and black-owned businesses.
However, Target has not explicitly linked the decision to the lawsuits, and the move follows a broader trend of major US companies, including Walmart and McDonald’s, reducing their DEI commitments in response to political and social pushback.
US President Donald Trump has taken action against DEI programs since returning to office last month. On his first day back in office, Trump signed executive orders aimed at eliminating DEI initiatives in federal agencies and among government contractors, arguing that such programs promote discrimination.
Target has not commented on the latest lawsuit.

56,2025-02-22,"Cutting corners: The software engineering job market has experienced a significant downturn, with job openings hitting a five-year low, according to an analysis of data from Indeed by Practical Engineer. The statistics reveal a stark 35 percent decrease in software developer job listings compared to five years ago, marking a dramatic shift in the industry's employment landscape. 
This decline is particularly noteworthy when compared to other sectors. While the overall job market has seen a 10 percent increase in listings since February 2020, software development positions have plummeted. This contrasts sharply with growth in areas such as construction (25 percent), accounting (24 percent), and electrical engineering (20 percent).
The software development sector has also experienced very volatile fluctuations in recent years. Job listings more than doubled during the pandemic-era boom of 2021 and 2022, outpacing all other industries. However, this surge was followed by an equally dramatic fall, with current vacancy numbers 3.5 times lower than their mid-2022 peak.

Trend in software development job postings in various countries
- Indeed.com data as compiled by Fred / Practical Engineer
Several factors contribute to this decline. The end of zero-percent interest rates has had a significant impact on the tech industry, affecting hiring practices, venture capital funding, and the survival of tech startups. However, this alone doesn't explain the hiring slowdown and layoffs at highly profitable Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and Google, according to author Gergely Orosz.
He posits that many companies may still be adjusting after over-recruiting in 2021-2022, leading to a more cautious approach to hiring.
Additionally, the rise of generative AI and LLMs may be influencing the job market. These technologies have shown particular promise in coding – 75 percent of engineers reported the use of AI coding tools in a recent survey. Some speculate that companies might be adopting a ""wait and see"" approach, assessing the potential productivity gains from these tools before expanding their engineering teams.

Salesforce's recent decision to keep its software engineering headcount flat while reporting a 30 percent productivity gain from AI tools exemplifies this trend. However, this also raises questions about product development and market fit, as the company simultaneously plans to hire additional salespeople.
The emergence of highly efficient small teams at companies like Linear and Bluesky challenges traditional notions of engineering team size. These companies have achieved significant user bases and product adoption with remarkably small engineering teams, suggesting a potential shift toward leaner, more efficient development processes.

All job postings on Indeed vs software development job postings
- Indeed.com data as compiled by Fred / Practical Engineer
Orosz also points out that Indeed's data may not provide a complete picture of the job market. The platform may be losing popularity for posting software engineering jobs, particularly among startups and some Big Tech companies. For instance, Microsoft lists more software-related jobs on its own site than are reflected in Indeed's data.
So, while the Indeed data should be considered directionally correct, indicating a genuine decrease in developer job listings, it may not fully represent hiring trends in startups or accurately track Big Tech hiring. Still, it is clear that the software engineering job market is undergoing significant changes, influenced by economic factors, technological advancements, and evolving company strategies.

57,2025-02-22,"Bunney has done workwear and bags. What's next? Bunny jewelry for Bunney? Try rabbit jewelry by UNDERCOVER and Bunney.
The UNDERCOVER collaboration continues Bunney's ""The Rabbit"" series, the latest edition of its Selected Works publication. ""The Rabbit"" installment from Bunney's very own magazine kicked off last year, unpacking not just the animal's journey in the natural world but its impact on art and culture.
Bunney commemorated the release of ""The Rabbit"" project with a Shibuya exhibition, which included a couple of notable collaborations. Specifically, Bunney teamed up with Carhartt WIP for rabbit-branded workwear and pretty travel jewelry bags by Porter Yoshida, honoring the occasion in a stylish and hop-tastic manner.
For UNDERCOVER x Bunney, a rabbit padlock is the star of the jewelry collab. The piece was created by Hong Kong's Wah-Tung Lock Factory, which specializes in surprisingly affordable metal goods. 
Sex Pistols' second bassist, Sid Vicious, famously wore the rabbit padlock during his days in the punk rock band. ""Sid put the lock on a chain around his neck, and I don't think it ever came off again; not for sentimental reasons, he just didn't take the key,"" Bunney's press release reads. ""Comfort didn't seem to be his thing.""
With the Vicious story in mind, it makes sense to bring Undercover along for the ride, as punk culture is one of the streetwear brand's biggest influences. Jewelry is also part of UNDERCOVER's in-line collection.
When initially produced, the rabbit locks came with various brandings from a lapine illustration to a simple ""R."" UNDERCOVER and Bunney opted for the classic letter stamp plus the labels' signature sign-offs for their team-up. 
UNDERCOVER and Bunney bring things full circle, attaching the padlock charm to not just necklaces but bracelets. Funny enough, there's also a rabbit padlock keyring.
Fans can catch the UNDERCOVER x Bunney's jewelry collaboration on February 22. Pieces will be available in various sizes at UNDERCOVER, Dover Street Market, and Bunney.

Washington, D.C., is experiencing a sharp rise in unemployment claims as the Trump administration continues its sweeping layoffs of federal employees deemed non-essential or unproductive. While the rest of the nation enjoys historically low jobless claims, the nationâs capital is feeling the brunt of President Trumpâs efforts to streamline government operations and eliminate wasteful spending. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by senior adviser Elon Musk, has already saved taxpayers an estimated $55 billion in its first month, according to White House officials. The layoffs, which have targeted thousands of federal workers across agencies like the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Internal Revenue Service, are part of a broader initiative to reduce the size of the federal workforce and cut costs. While the cuts have sparked protests and criticism from some quarters, the administration argues that many of the eliminated positions were tied to liberal causes that strayed from the core missions of their respective agencies.A regional recession looms for D.C. The impact of the layoffs is most evident in Washington, D.C., where initial jobless claims have surged dramatically. In the four weeks since Trump took office, 5,455 District of Columbia employees filed for unemployment benefits â a sharp increase from 2,014 during the same period last year. Economists predict that the cuts could push the city into a mild recession, with unemployment rates expected to rise from 5.5% to 6.5% by mid-2026. âThis is a very unusual situation for D.C.,â said Adam Kamins, a regional economist at Moodyâs Analytics. He said that the city is not generally vulnerable to economic cycles because of the overall stability of government jobs. Kamins added that the layoffs could ripple through the local economy, affecting restaurants, retailers, and other businesses that rely on federal workers.National job market remains strong While D.C. struggles, the rest of the country continues to thrive. Nationally, initial jobless claims remain near multi-decade lows, with 219,000 Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week. States like California have seen significant decreases in jobless claims, underscoring the resilience of the broader economy. The Trump administration has framed the layoffs as a necessary step to eliminate inefficiency and refocus federal agencies on their core missions. âI think our objective is to make sure that the employees we pay are being productive and effective,â said Kevin Hassett, President Trumpâs chief economic adviser.DOGE delivers savings and reform The Department of Government Efficiency has already identified billions in savings by canceling contracts for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) training, corporate media subscriptions, and other non-essential expenditures. These reforms align with Trumpâs campaign promises to reduce government waste and prioritize taxpayer dollars. While the layoffs have caused hardship for some federal employees, the Trump administration maintains that these cuts are essential to restoring efficiency and accountability in government. As D.C. grapples with rising unemployment, the rest of the country continues to benefit from a strong job market and economic growth. With DOGE already saving taxpayers billions, the administrationâs reforms are proving to be a win for the nationâeven if they come at a cost for the federal workforce in Washington. Sources for this article include:  ZeroHedge.com  USAToday.com  NBCNews.com  TheNationalPulse.com

Kamins added that the layoffs could ripple through the local economy, affecting restaurants, retailers, and other businesses that rely on federal workers.National job market remains strong While D.C. struggles, the rest of the country continues to thrive. Nationally, initial jobless claims remain near multi-decade lows, with 219,000 Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week. States like California have seen significant decreases in jobless claims, underscoring the resilience of the broader economy. The Trump administration has framed the layoffs as a necessary step to eliminate inefficiency and refocus federal agencies on their core missions. âI think our objective is to make sure that the employees we pay are being productive and effective,â said Kevin Hassett, President Trumpâs chief economic adviser.DOGE delivers savings and reform The Department of Government Efficiency has already identified billions in savings by canceling contracts for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) training, corporate media subscriptions, and other non-essential expenditures. These reforms align with Trumpâs campaign promises to reduce government waste and prioritize taxpayer dollars. While the layoffs have caused hardship for some federal employees, the Trump administration maintains that these cuts are essential to restoring efficiency and accountability in government. As D.C. grapples with rising unemployment, the rest of the country continues to benefit from a strong job market and economic growth. With DOGE already saving taxpayers billions, the administrationâs reforms are proving to be a win for the nationâeven if they come at a cost for the federal workforce in Washington. Sources for this article include:  ZeroHedge.com  USAToday.com  NBCNews.com  TheNationalPulse.com


 The layoffs, which have targeted thousands of federal workers across agencies like the Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Internal Revenue Service, are part of a broader initiative to reduce the size of the federal workforce and cut costs. While the cuts have sparked protests and criticism from some quarters, the administration argues that many of the eliminated positions were tied to liberal causes that strayed from the core missions of their respective agencies.A regional recession looms for D.C. The impact of the layoffs is most evident in Washington, D.C., where initial jobless claims have surged dramatically. In the four weeks since Trump took office, 5,455 District of Columbia employees filed for unemployment benefits â a sharp increase from 2,014 during the same period last year.

                            READ LATER
                        
Towards the beginning of 2024, Indian stock market appeared indomitable and appeared poised to continue scale new peaks effortlessly. The mood is the reverse now with investors and traders wondering how much lower stock prices will fall in the correction which began last September. 
The long-term outlook, which covers a period of more than 20 years, does not undergo frequent changes and therefore reviewing the trend in the Nifty50 and Sensex every year is not necessary. In our long-term view published on January 15, 2024, titled ‘Long-term outlook for Nifty50, Sensex: Ride the rally but watch out for long-term correction’, we had written: “There is no question that the Indian equity market is in a bullish long-term super-cycle. But the need for caution arises from the fact that the recent leg of this upcycle, which began from the pandemic low in March 2020 is almost four years old. The Nifty50 and Sensex are also nearing some long-term targets. While the ongoing rally can take the benchmarks higher from these levels, a long-term corrective phase is around the corner.”
Our long-term view remains the same. The bullish long-term super-cycle (based on Elliott wave theory) in the Nifty 50 and the Sensex, which began from the October 2008 low, is still in progress. One leg of this super cycle ended at the September 2024 peaks of 26,277 and 85,978 in the Nifty50 and Sensex respectively. The decline from this peak has resulted in 13 per cent pull back. 
The way the correction is progressing so far indicates a shallow but long-drawn correction which can make the bellwether indices moving sideways with a bearish bias for a year or more. But completion of this consolidation will get the stock market ready for the next wave higher which can take Nifty50 to the 38,000 to 41,000 level. We will need a strong close below 19,100 to make us revise our long-term outlook.
The correction may appear excruciatingly prolonged for investors who have entered the stock market over the last four years, but these corrections are essential to adjust over-valuations and bring prices towards their fundamental worth. Also, while the correction in large-cap stocks which form part of the index can be shallow, mid and small-cap stocks which have run far beyond their fundamental worth, can see a much deeper correction. It could be akin to the move between 2018 and 2020, when the large-caps edged higher, but broader market suffered.
As mentioned above, the long-term wave counts for the Nifty50 and Sensex have not altered much. If we look at the wave counts from the 2001 low or the 2008 low, we have a cluster of targets between 24,000 and 28,000 in the Nifty50. That’s where the index is halting now. Next upper targets fall between 38,000 and 41,000 and beyond that, at 51,000 to 54,000. 
We will have to review our long-term outlook only on a strong close below 19,100. This level will need to be breached strongly to signal that a serious correction is in the offing, which can drag the Nifty to 17,099 or 13,063.
Corresponding long-term targets for the Sensex, where it is halting now, are between 73,000 and 81,016. Strong move beyond 81,000 will open the way for the 93,000 to 98,000 band and beyond that, 114,450 to 134,688. A strong weekly close below 62,000 is needed to revise the long-term view to cautious.
As explained, the decline from the September 2024 peak in the Nifty50 appears to be a part of the up-move from the pandemic low, from 7,511 in the Nifty. The third leg of this up-move that began from March 2023, appears to be still unfolding. 
The most likely movement for the index over the coming year will be a sideways move in a band between 22,000 and 28,000. Decline below 22,000 will take the index to 20,600 or 19,100. Breach of 28,000 is needed to start another steep bull-run to 35,000 level. But that appears quite unlikely in the months ahead. 
The Sensex is also halting tantalisingly at the 38.2 per cent (Fibonacci retracement level) from the March 2023 low. This leads to the possibility of the move continuing, resulting in a sideways move between 70,000 and 93,000 over the next year. Next supports are at 68,000 and 62,000.
If we consider the index return since the pandemic lows, Indian stock market has outperformed other Asian emerging markets by a strong measure. The Nifty 50 (176 per cent) and Sensex (166 per cent) are at the top among Asia pacific indices, after Karachi, Sri Lanka and Mongolian stock exchange indices. The returns in Indian markets are on par with those in advanced economies such as the S&P 500, DAX and Nikkei, which are clocking good returns.
It is therefore not surprising that foreign portfolio investors have turned net sellers since September, as they cash out some profits. Valuation premium in Indian markets over their emerging market counterparts also makes Indian stocks more vulnerable at this juncture.
The S&P 500 index is poised at its life-time peak currently and the uptrend appears very strong. The third part of the move from the March 2020 low has the immediate target of 6,118, which it has already achieved. Further up-move will give it the targets of 7,121 and 7,741. The long-term outlook will be threatened only on a strong weekly close below 4,800. 
As Donald Trump’s shenanigans bolster companies in the US and the US dollar, global institutional money is likely to move towards US stocks, giving strength to the S&P 500.

66,2025-02-22,"The Bybit hacker, supposedly a North Korean entity, is now one of the world's largest ether holders, which may have bullish implications for the cryptocurrency's spot price.
According to data from Arkham Intelligence and Coinbase executive Connor Grogan, this malicious actor holds 489,000 ETH, valued at approximately $1.34 billion, constituting about 0.4% of ether's total supply, making it the 14th-largest Ether holder globally. That puts the hacker ahead of the Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum's CEO Vitalik Buterin and Fidelity. 
It's important to note that the addresses linked to this entity are being closely monitored and backlisted by exchanges, which means the hacker will likely struggle to offload these coins in the market.
In simpler terms, the hacked ether supply is likely lost permanently. Furthermore, Bybit, which has reportedly secured a bridged loan from unnamed partners to cover nearly 80% of the ether lost in the Friday hack, will likely need to purchase coins in the market.
""As far as this supply is concerned, it's essentially gone. No OTC desk or exchange will facilitate the movement of such a large amount. Meanwhile, Bybit is short 402k ETH. The bridge loan may cover immediate needs, but purchasing will still be necessary,"" Vance Spencer, co-founder of the crypto VC firm Framework Ventures, said on X.
That probably explains why ether has bounced 2.6% to $2,730 from the overnight low of around $2,614. Funding rates in perpetual futures tied to ether remain positive, implying a bias for long positions, according to data source Coingecko.

67,2025-02-22,"Crypto exchange Bitget has transferred 40,000 ether (ETH), worth $105 million, to Bybit, offering crucial support to its industry counterpart in the wake of the over billion-dollar hack suffered by the exchange.
The funds transferred are from Bitget's own reserves, not user deposits, which remain securely stored on the platform and can be cross checked through the proof of reserves, the exchange's CEO, Gracy Chen, said in a note shared with CoinDesk, while assuring more support if needed.
""At Bitget we strongly believe in supporting the community and everyone contributing towards the growth of crypto,"" Chen said.
A suspected North Korean entity drained approximately $1.4 billion in ether from Bybit on Friday. The hack prompted an unprecedented wave of withdrawal requests from users, with the exchange successfully processing 99% of them, effectively facing a significant market stress test.
Part of the stolen funds started to move during Asian afternoon hours on Saturday with over 5,000 ETH moved through eXch mixer - a service that masks wallet address - before being sent to bridge protocol ChainFlip where the stash was converted to bitcoin (BTC).
In an X post, ChainFlip said it couldn't block fund movements as it was a fully decentralized applications that relies on automated smart contracts, but that it had ""turned off some frontend services to stop the flow.""
On the other hand, Bitget has blacklisted wallets tied to the hacker that drained ether worth millions from Bybit on Friday.
""We will block any transactions flowing in from illicit addresses to the exchange once it has been monitored. Our team of security, and researchers, are currently tracking these activities,"" Chen said.
Despite the hack, Bybit had managed to process over 350,000 withdrawal requests and has since restored normal withdrawal operations, per an X post.

The story of the original Bell Bullitt helmet is a bonafide motorcycling fairy tale. Just over a decade ago, industrial designer Chad Hodge designed and built a retro-inspired helmet as part of his final year thesis, with clear cues from vintage lids like the legendary 1960s Bell Star.
Bell saw the concept, loved it, and brought Chad in-house to put it into production.

The Bell Bullitt hit the market just as the alt-moto scene reached its zenith. It spread like wildfire—offering riders a premium lid with modern protection, vintage styling, and elegant finishes, and inspiring countless copycats along the way. These days, you can’t go on a group ride without spotting several Bell Bullitts in the crowd.

Following the Bullitt’s success, Bell Helmets has just thrown the wraps off the all-new Bell Bullitt GT and Bell Bullitt GT carbon. The new Bullitt GT series delivers classic aesthetics and modern engineering in spades, honoring Bell’s rich legacy in motorcycle racing and culture.
With a decade-plus of real-world use under the belt, Bell’s designers and engineers had ample data to work with while remixing the Bullitt formula.

The helmet’s iconic silhouette, wide field of view, and plush finishes remain—but Bell has cranked its performance up to eleven to create a modern evolution of the Bullitt.
The new Bell Bullitt GT uses a 42% fiberglass construction for its shell, while the Bullitt GT Carbon uses a 40% carbon fiber construction. Both are DOT- and ECE22.06-certified, with three shell sizes across the six-size range. A large Bullitt GT weighs 1,500 grams, with a large Bullitt GT Carbon tickling the scale at just 1,400 grams.

The Bullitt GT’s wide shield and circular hinge plates recall those of its predecessor, but they’ve been vastly improved. The eye port sports a redesigned gasket that creates a tighter seal, and the hinges feature a clever magnetic snap-off design, making for quick and tool-less shield swaps.
The Bullit GT also retains the circular vents across its brow—but those are now closable via a mechanism that’s been cleverly hidden underneath the chin bar. The interior has been updated with a focus on easy maintenance, and you can swap out the cheek pads to fine-tune the Bullitt GT’s fit.

There are ten solid color and graphic options across the two versions of the new Bullitt GT, each finished with either a black, brown, or red leather interior. And if you need more variety, Bell has an array of flat and bubble shields on offer. (With 15 styles to choose from, that’s a total of 150 variations.)
All in all, the new Bell Bullitt GT is a throwback of a throwback—a stylish and thoughtful redesign of one of the most popular retro-themed helmets on the market. Is it a worthy successor? We have one en route to us as we speak, and will report back in due course.

Published onFebruary 22, 2025
We’re almost through the second month of 2025, and already, we’ve seen two of the biggest smartphone launches of the year. OnePlus kicked things off in January with the OnePlus 13, and earlier this month, the Samsung Galaxy S25 series debuted.
Although the OnePlus 13 and Samsung’s Galaxy S25 trio received positive reviews, the two launches couldn’t have been any different. The OnePlus 13 is a significant improvement over the OnePlus 12, offering meaningful internal and external changes that make it a thoroughly impressive year-over-year upgrade. Meanwhile, the Samsung Galaxy S25 series is about as flat of an update over the S24 as you could ask for.
That’s not to say Samsung’s Galaxy S25 phones are bad (they aren’t), and Samsung’s strategy of tepid YoY smartphone changes is nothing new. But in light of how good the OnePlus 13 is and how tame the Galaxy S25 series is, it’s never been more apparent that Samsung is asleep at the wheel.
Last year’s OnePlus 12 was great. It was a solid upgrade over the OnePlus 11 before it and gave OnePlus a strong foundation to work from for the OnePlus 13. The OnePlus 13 isn’t a radically different phone from the OnePlus 12, but there are enough small yet meaningful changes that make it feel like one.
For me, it all starts with the design. The OnePlus 12’s hardware was strong, featuring a lovely “Flowy Emerald” green color and a distinctive camera bump. The OnePlus 13 has the same bones as the OnePlus 12 but is vastly upgraded in every way. This year’s “Midnight Blue” color is one of my all-time favorites. The deep blue contrasts beautifully with the white camera bump and silver accents, creating one of the most handsome-looking phones I’ve ever seen. I’m also a sucker for the vegan leather finish, which is grippy and immune from fingerprints.
OnePlus also seemingly listened to fan/critic feedback and replaced the OnePlus 12’s drastically curved display with a much flatter one on the OnePlus 13. Combined with the flat frame, it makes the OnePlus 13 as functional as it is beautiful. The company could have easily kept the OnePlus 12’s design for another year, but it didn’t, and the OnePlus 13 is better for it.
Another hardware improvement you can’t see, but one that’s arguably more important, is the OnePlus 13’s IP68 and IP69 ratings — a massive upgrade over the OnePlus 12’s paltry IP65 protection. OnePlus has long skimped out on IP certifications for its phones, either forgoing them entirely or delivering less comprehensive ones than the competition. OnePlus is now a leader in the space, offering one of the only IP69-certified phones available today.
But it’s not just the design/hardware that OnePlus got right. The OnePlus 13 has brand new ultrawide and telephoto cameras compared to the OnePlus 12; the battery is significantly larger, the new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip is outstanding, and OnePlus’s OxygenOS 15 is a massive improvement compared to previous versions of the software — so much so that OxygenOS has become my favorite Android skin/interface. The fingerprint sensor is better, too, going from an old optical sensor to a newer (and faster) ultrasonic one.
These upgrades might not seem like much on their own, but in practice, they all come together in a really special way. The OnePlus 12 was a great phone, but the OnePlus 13 is a remarkable one — and a large part of that is thanks to the meaningful and well-executed year-over-year changes from the OnePlus 12.
It’s not news to anyone that the OnePlus 13 is fantastic. However, now that we’ve seen Samsung’s Galaxy S25 series and its striking similarity to the Galaxy S24 lineup, it makes the OnePlus 13 stand out that much more. And simultaneously, it also shows just how painfully safe Samsung played its cards this year.
It starts with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Samsung’s top-of-the-line flagship is an objectively great phone, and in a bubble, you could even say it’s darn near perfect. But the Galaxy S24 Ultra was a great phone, too, and side-by-side, it’s almost impossible to tell what’s new. Seriously — look at the picture above. One of them is the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and one is the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Can you tell which is which?
Beyond the stale aesthetics, other changes are few and far between. The S25 Ultra’s battery and charging specs are identical to the S24 Ultra. The display is ever-so-slightly larger but is otherwise unchanged. The camera setup is virtually the same, too, save for a new 50MP ultrawide camera. Samsung even made the puzzling decision to downgrade the S Pen, removing the remote Bluetooth functionality it’s had since 2018’s Galaxy Note 9.
The Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus are in a similar boat. The designs? The same. Displays? Identical. Cameras? Unchanged. Battery capacity and charge speeds? Los mismos. All of the Galaxy S25 phones have Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, some new AI features, and … well, that’s about it. There’s an argument to be made that Samsung doesn’t need to change as much with its phones every year because it typically starts at a higher point than OnePlus. That may have been true a couple of years ago, but it hardly has any weight today.
For $800 and $1,000 smartphones, respectively, it’s inexcusable that the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus’s camera hardware is unchanged from the Galaxy S22 series. It’s equally baffling that the Galaxy S25 has the same battery and charging specs as the five-year-old Galaxy S20.
I’m not asking Samsung to reinvent the wheel every year, and I don’t think anyone else is. But it’s also not like the Galaxy S series has been perfect and free of any needed upgrades for the last few years.
The unfortunate conclusion to this argument is that I don’t think there is one. We can all agree that the OnePlus 13 is a phenomenal upgrade over the OnePlus 12 and one of the best Android phones you can buy. We can also agree that the Galaxy S25 series is a dull, boring successor to the Galaxy S24 lineup. However, unless something drastic happens, it’s hard to see Samsung changing its ways anytime soon.
Samsung has a commanding force in the US smartphone market. Its phones are in every carrier store, its brand awareness is one of the highest, and it has matching sales figures to boot. You and I know the OnePlus 13 puts the Galaxy S25 to shame. But unless that starts eating into Samsung’s bottom line — which it almost certainly won’t — Samsung has little reason to spend a heap of money and R&D talent on new designs, battery tech, etc., if it can keep coasting along with the bare minimum upgrades every year.
I want to see Samsung again be the driving force of smartphone innovation it has repeatedly shown us it can be. Samsung is capable of making far better and more interesting phones than the Galaxy S25, and whether because of the OnePlus 13 or something else, I hope it starts doing so soon."

79,2025-02-22,"What caught my eye this week.
It’s not been easy to find reasons to be optimistic about the shrinking British stock market in recent years.
But I think how private investors, fund managers, the investment trust industry, and investment platforms worked together to defeat US firm Saba’s designs on the trust sector might qualify.
As I wrote last month, there was something of a last alliance vibe about this coalition of the unwilling.
But so comprehensively was Saba defeated – it lost all seven showdowns, and on large turnouts of private investors who overwhelmingly voted no – that the result was quite heartening.
This was shareholder democracy in action, and I’m all for it.
Moreover the platforms showed that they can facilitate such a democracy if called upon.
In the early days of Monevator, lots of readers urged me to write articles about the evils of nominee share ownership and the demise of paper share certificates.
I saw their point. But I also saw the changes as inevitable and not the most important battle to win compared to, say, lowering fees or spreading knowledge about index fund investing.
Anyway such appeals stopped long ago, whether because the proponents accepted the change or because they moved on to a realm where their voice was even less influential than here on this mortal coil.
But wherever they are, I hope they’re heartened too.
Nominee ownership and representation via electronic voting on platforms does not inevitably mean disenfranchisement, or to be kicked around by those with the billions and the biggest boots.
And that is good news, whether or not you agreed with Saba’s charges and proposals. (Personally I share some of his complaints. But I was not persuaded by the remedy he was offering.)
Saba is now going after a new quartet of trusts, suggesting they be turned into open-ended funds.
Curiously, Moguls-featured Pershing Square isn’t on the list despite its yawning discount.
Anyway, we’ll have to whether Saba’s relentlessness eventually exhausts the opposition.
More UK investors are apparently getting in on the act too. For example, the hugely talented Christopher Mills is said to be raising money for a trust that will work to close discounts at rivals.
As somebody who sees rife opportunity in the trust sector, I’m not surprised.
Though ironically two Mills-affiliated investment trusts themselves sit on 25-30% discounts…
I’ll leave more comment in that direction for our Moguls member posts though.
Indeed for most Monevator readers who sensibly invest in index funds, this might all seem a bit irrelevant.
But I’d suggest it’s very relevant.
As index funds take up an ever-larger share of the overall investing pie, it’s really important that cheap and effective investing for the masses doesn’t become a lazy synonym for disenfranchised investors and the fracturing of shareholder democracy.
That charge has already being made as index funds have grown to dominate the investing landscape. For example, from the New Statesman:
The upshot of this mix is an ownership regime with a chief interest in maximising assets – whether by minimising costs to take market share, or by promoting general asset price inflation – and takes little interest both in how capital is allocated and how any company within its diversified portfolio is governed.
In other words, such an ownership regime takes no ethical stance on what those companies produce, how they are run, what they sell or what impact they have on the planet.
It’s a valid concern.
Squint though and you can see this battle with Saba as upholding the thin end of the same wedge that ends with Vanguard cutting fees further in the US recently.
The common thread is what’s ultimately in the long-term interests of ordinary shareholders.
Perhaps there’s even a future where even index fund investors get to vote their wishes somehow on the vast range of issues raising by the firms their tracker funds hold – albeit perhaps by aggregating their general wishes at the fund manager level?
Time will tell. But I’m more hopeful about that sort of thing than I was two months ago.
Have a great weekend.

I share your ambivalence about Saba (diagnosis of trouble in the IT industry largely right, treatment to some extent flawed).  But its hard not to see the shareholder revolts against Saba as a bunch of turkeys voting for Christmas.  I can’t understand why anyone rational would vote against a strategy which would allow them to exit failing investments at the non-discounted share price.  It’s not as if there aren’t other better places (eg index funds) to put your money.  I am afraid I see a large dose of chauvanism, sentimentality and sorry to say ignorance amongst the motivations of share holders.  ITs have been half-hearted in their measures to reduce their discounts because guess what that would often reduce their fees.  Couple that with the unhealthy relationships between some platforms and the industry (Hargreaves Lansdown & Woodford come to mind) and it’s hard to view the UK IT industry any more favourably than the Saba hedge fund. A plague on both their houses I am sorry to say
@TI. I don’t really understand your negativity re: Saba. Saba offered close to full cash exits (99% of NAV) on these shares. That forced the managers to offer the same. 
These trusts are mismanaging their investors’ money. If a trust is really operating on a 30% discount to NAV, then the managers should simply liquidate the investments to return the NAV back to investors, crystallizing the gain. They they then launch another fund the next day with the same objectives. If that starts trading on a 30% discount, repeat and rinse. What’s not to like?
I just don’t see any good reason for a trust to continue to exist at a substantial discount to NAV. It creates poor sentiment and does sort of imply there might be more of a problem under the hatch than they are letting on. A few successful liquidations of trusts, returning something close to 100% of NAV, might help the whole industry.
Question:
Is the discount on UT just a consequence of their fees?  Let’s say market return is expected to be 8% and the trust charges 1.7% in fees (so ~ 1.6% over costs of a tracker).   So the fees eat 20% of the return, in effect you only own the equivalent of 80% of the assets? Ie 20% discount to NAV
A bit like leasehold properties..
@Boltt – agreed but also interest rate sensitivity for certain ITs (infra, REITs etc)
@Passive Investor & @ZX: that’s quite a harsh verdict there on the investors’ votes. 
@ZX at #11 (just below my own post as @TLI) on this thread here:
https://monevator.com/weekend-reading-mission-impossible-for-active-managers/
said that less choice is bad (“fundamentally reducing my choice to invest exactly as I please”) (I agree BTW).
Is that not what investors wanted here but which Saba tried to take away from them?
@DH. Choice is good. Private investors have the right to make their choice. I just don’t understand why they voted against. Just take the uplift to NAV and then reinvest in another product. There is nothing about these trusts than cannot be replicated elsewhere. In the meantime, they are just paying fees. 
Moreover, if it’s not Saba, it will be someone else. You can’t expect a bunch of fairly vanilla holdings to trade massively away from their NAV forever. Someone is going to play for that arb. I think it’s naive for private investors to assume that every method that could be used to extract that value will leave them in as good as position as the Saba offer did.
@ delta hedge.  Re-reading what I wrote it is a little harsh but I still don’t really get why people feel such loyalty to what as @ZXSpectrum48K so well describes are badly failing investment vehicles.  In a nut shell there is very bad misalignment between the interests of the IT managers (keep the IT running at all costs to harvest the fees) and investors.  I don’t understand why investors can’t see that.  But then I’ve never really been a fan of ITs except as a way of accessing niche market sectors (eg I have small positions in BG Shin Nippon and Henderson Small Co).  To my mind gearing is just another way of increasing volatility and mimicking dividend smoothing is easy enough to do yourself.   PS Today in the FT I did read one rational reason for one investor not wanting to cash out which is to avoid crystallising CGT.
Regarding investment trusts / Saba / and so on, I think I’ve been pretty clear about seeing the cognitive dissonance in my own reaction… 😉 More so in the previous post perhaps.
But yes, it’s fair to say I’m pleased with this result.
Let’s leave aside whether any of these sort of active retail-targeted funds need to exist (most of this website is dedicated to saying “no” and I’m happy with that ratio).
I believe it’d be pretty hard to create the investment trust sector if it didn’t already exist. I believe it does offer interesting exposures for the adventurously active but otherwise pretty ordinary investor (in terms of knowledge and firepower). And I think the waxing and waning of discounts presents opportunities that one can exploit / scalp for a bit of extra profit. I like that all these things exist in the investing world for UK investors.
In terms of Saba specifically, the whole thing was as I saw it pretty much an AUM gathering exercise at a moment of extreme weakness for the sector. It was done for Saba’s benefit, which is of course fair enough, but not a reason for someone to vote for it.
But should all the targeted trusts wind themselves up instead? Or any trusts on discounts?
I don’t believe so.
While this particular downturn is now getting pretty drawn out, the general coming in and out of fashion (discounts/premiums) in investment trusts is not unusual. They are double layered in that way in terms of supply and demand. (Supply and demand for what they hold, and for the trust itself). Those targeted I wouldn’t describe as “failing” (except in as much as that as active funds most perhaps/will fail over the long-term versus passives, but we’ve put that to one side, and anyway they might not due to structural advantages like gearing and buybacks).
Today’s failing investment trust is tomorrow’s shoot the lights out winner. As I’ve said several times on Moguls, people say why should discounts close? Who knows (I can give reasons, and have elsewhere) but they do. This has already happened with several funds in this cycle. Not just Saba-scooped up ones, either.
I did well with a small holding of HGT capital over the past couple of years, for instance. It was on very near-30% discount a couple of years ago and now it is back at par.
I don’t believe its shareholders or the UK investor landscape would be better off had it been liquidated back in 2022 when it was in distress. The long-term record happens to be strong, but equally importantly it offers useful and differentiated exposure. I accept not all trusts do this. But even bog-standard equity income funds will trade at par again someday, I’d happily wager.
Reasonable people can disagree about all the above of course, depending on one’s perspective etc, but that’s how I see it.
@Delta Hedge was @TLI all along ?
Yeah. @TLI was a homage to Sir Roger Penrose’s diagrams:
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrose_diagram
And was also a tribute of sorts to sci-fi author and former maths and physics teacher Steve Baxter’s book of the same name. It didn’t seem to map well to finance though, so I change over to Delta Hedge.
Not at the dinner table indeed. I’ve always been pretty engaged with politics, at least local to where I’m living at the time – UK, US, elsewhere – but I have lately switched off as much as possible. The US isn’t coming back from this one, at least not in the usual timespan of an administration or two. It is far easier to tear institutions down than to rebuild (and re-fund) them. Friends in public service are living in a daily state of anxiety as they watch their leadership, peers, teams, work eliminated, awaiting an email telling them their career is suddenly over.
I only learned of this yesterday.

I enjoyed investing in Investment Trusts during the evolution of my financial path to investing and retirement
Alliance Trust set up a first SIPP for me that worked well -now sold to Interactive Investor -I am still there with 2 SIPPs and 2 ISAs
I remember that I had some fun with a Turkey Investment trust and made a little money over a year or two
Personal Assets Trust seemed to be run on the sort of lines that a long term conservative investor like me appreciated though it was a relatively small fund
The erudite writings of Ian Rutherford and especially Robin Angus were a delight and a treasure trove of investing information
Then came John Bogle , Vanguard and Index Investing
Alliance Trust,F&C etc were obviously expensive closet index trackers
Investment Trusts were Active Management in investment style,relatively expensive and very dependent on their star managers so I exited the field -indexed from then on – and have never returned
For active investors they remain an exciting investment with the possibility (losing)of making money but too rich for me

@Delta Hedge. Interesting. Stephen Baxter had passed me by. Tempted to give him a try.
I had been a bit concerned, not seeing @TLI comment for some time, so am glad to know you are alive & well.
Re: “Not at the dinner table” links this week and the President ‘Mump’ regime (as the world’s most famous living South African can’t hold Presidential office under the Constitution, we can’t quite call this the Musk regime): had wanted to post this link to the last (March 2021) Tesla piece in Monevator, but the thread’s now closed: so, accordingly, here’s Noahpinion today on don’t underestimate Elon:
https://open.substack.com/pub/noahpinion/p/only-fools-think-elon-is-incompetent
The cat phishing link rang true for my time in Japan. New hires from abroad just wouldn’t turn up for training. Typically they would not respond to emails and phone calls, so we never knew if they had cold feet and stayed at home, or found a better job using the work visa that we had sponsored.
Saba won. They bought large positions at a discount to NAV and forced most the fund managers to liquidate at 99% of NAV.
How is buying something for [75] and receiving 99 an “embarrassing failure” (to use the AIC’s language)?
To stop or not? I wish I knew the answer.  My job is pretty decent at the moment, vacancies filled, friendly team.  The main thing that would make me stop is if it becomes enshitified (again, been there done that, no thanks). I’m only 47 but I’ve seen too many colleagues die 55 – 65 die without retiring, so I’m aiming 50 – 55 (? Go for Fat FIRE)
@TI. I’m a big fan of investor choice. More funds = better in my mind. Yet, some of the trusts Saba was targetting were really too small to be viable. CQS Natural Resources Growth Income, Henderson Opportunities Trust HOT and Keystone Positive Change Trust are all sub £200mm. They are not making the managers rich. They are not making private investors rich.
My hypothesis is that many trusts have price dynamics that are showing real signs of contamination. Essentially, they should be trading at a higher price but because the’ve been trading at a major discount to NAV for an extended period, trading at that price becomes “normal”. Every time the prices starts to rise, you find trapped longs trying to exit. A new buyer won’t trade unless they can get a bargain the current NAV discount (i.e. if it’s been trading at 20-30% discount, they will only buy at 30%).  
I’ve seen this happen in the EM distressed debt market. Something bad happens, the debt (correctly) revalues. The price falls too far. The problem stabilizes but the price never returns to fair value. The positioning is just too contaminated. 
The answer is usually to restructure. If you’ve got the capital, you buy back the old debt in the market at say a 30% discount to par. If not, you offer the current holders par value on the old bond and spin them into a new bond. Guess what? The new bond doesn’t trade at a 30% discount to par. It trades at par. I think ITs might well do the same.
‘Does trend following still work on stocks?’ was an interesting read.
I had thought though that the technique they are using was generally referred to as Momentum.
Not in the paper, but from their charts it looks like switching from Momentum to a MarketCap strategy temporarily after a crash (2008, 2020) could be a good tweak (I guess that makes sense, since most of the market trends up after a crash).
@Algernond: Check out Dual Momentum Systems ‘Smart Leverage’ (the Triad + and Triad ++ portfolios)
https://dualmomentumsystems.com/strategies/
It’s a free site run by a Gary Antonacci fan who’s developed DIY ideas to improve the basic index (US v ex US) Dual Momentum including, for LETFs, using them only after an outsized fall in the S&P 500. 
@ZX #21: An intriguing conjecture. Taking Occam’s Razor to it:
Scenario 1: there’s a failure of the EMH with all IT pricing due to the price contamination effect which you describe. As there’s no systemic and systematic bid for an active managed closed end wrapper (unlike, as we’ve discussed before, for passive large cap ETF trackers, due to market inelasticity and the relentless flows from active to passive and via auto contributions into passive) the IT discounts embed themselves. They then persist because of a combination of psychological scarring amongst investors and bag holders bailing on each attempted rally.
Scenario 2: hight interest rates devalue the NPV of the future value of the yield at par for the IT’s underlying assets. So the ITs have to trade at a discount to tangible NAV. When the 30 year conventional gilt is 2% getting 5-6% with some inflation protection in infra and  renewable energy ITs looks attractive. With the 30 year is at 5.5% (as it recently touched) investors want ~8-10% from such ITs, all else being equal. That can only be accomplished by going to a huge (30-40%) discount.
Scenario 2 make fewer assumptions than Scenario 1.
Typo – that should be “higher interest rates” not “hight rates”. Only just spotted. Apologies.
@DH. Assume an closed-end fund (CEF) with a set of constituent stocks that are liquid. The CEF NAV is the sum of the NAVs of it’s constituents i.e. the weighted sum of the prices of the stocks. Those prices are already discounted. So the effect of higher govt bond yields is already incorporated into the price of the constituent stocks. You would be double counting to apply it again to the trust NAV. 
Now, I do think that higher bond yields have clearly impacted trust prices. That though is not due to any fundamental impact from discounting. It’s because the investor base for trusts tends to be older and more dividend focussed. They are more inclined to sell their trusts and replace with Gilts now yields are higher. They are less inclinded to buy (since retired). More inclined to sell down to fund living costs. Younger investors just buy trackers. So it’s just a supply-demand imbalance. Sorry, the market is simply not efficient. 
What I will say though is that at this point every hedge fund has this trade on (long trusts, short constituent stocks). So every time the discount narrows, they will sell the trusts and buy back the stocks to take profit. Repeat and rinse as many times as they can. That makes it even harder for the discount to narrow back to zero.
Yes you’re right @ZX. My Scenario 2 does double count the increased discount rate on future returns of the underlying trust assets. 
And you’re also right that the fact that CEFs/ITs persistently and consistently trade at a discount to their NAV, which itself should be appropriately discounted to interest rates (etc), does show marked market inefficiency. 
Whilst markets are mostly efficient most of the time; that must also necessarily mean that they’re sometimes inefficient across the board (i.e. an overreaction which gets corrected) and / or persistently inefficient in some specific areas (such as this). 
But for the average small punter might this particular inefficiency not create opportunities long term?
Say the discount never closes but ITs like TRIG manage to maintain a 10% dividend yield, as it presently does, over the long term. 
With the asset base for infrastructure and renewable energy ITs being somewhat inflation correlated, then – with dividend reinvestment compounding – that could allow them to eventually crush the general market return, which increasingly depends upon the jam tomorrow of future income growth promise. 
I’m thinking a long term Philip Morris / Altria situation where everyone hates the stock but it eventually wins the race. The investing Tortoise and the Hare if you will:
https://www.dividendgrowthinvestor.com/2024/07/the-best-performing-stock-in-past.html
@ZXSpectrum48K — Good comments, no real disagreement as such, except that I am less sure that one could liquidate the trusts (or at least the ones with liquid stocks) at very near NAV and then reboot. I suspect they’d be lost, at least until and unless there was some sustained bull market.
And I’m surely a little more concerned about that outcome / sentimental about it then you are! 😉
Re: hedge funds, I should hope they have it on, I’ve been ducking and diving around in trusts with at least half my own NAV give or take for two years and I’m just humble old me. 😉 
It’s fun, which is another reason I’d be saddened to see the opportunity set shrink (/choice diminish, as you say).
@Moonbrain   (14).
I dislike Amazon’s way of doing business, and buy from them only when I can hardly avoid doing so. I’ve long been aware that in ‘buying’ a Kindle book, I don’t actually own it, I’ve just bought a licence to read it. My response to that is that I have returned to reading printed books. I either borrow from my local library, or buy s/h on Ebay. Of the latter, I generally buy from worldofbooks, as they operate on a circular economy model, and authors receive something from each book sold. Besides, I love to do some bedtime reading, and I much prefer to read from a real book, rather than a screen. And finally, I get just a little kick from a wee moment of “… up yours, Jeff Bezos…”

@Vic — True, but from the perspective of Monevator editor I’m damned if I do and I’m damned if I don’t… 
As a long-time reader you’ve seen the turbulent / polarised response we get to political stuff, and yet I think you’ll be hard-pressed to find another investing/personal finance site that has been prepared to stick its neck out as much over the past nine years (and to lose readers in the process) than this one.
But to be fair to me / readers, we *are* an investing and personal finance (/FIRE etc) site first and foremost.
I don’t think politics can or should be entirely removed from that conversation, but there’s plenty of other places people can go talk about the latest instalment of a political descent that, yes, I’ve been doing my own tiny part to raise awareness of since the Referendum in 2016.
In contrast there’s far fewer places people can go to talk intelligently about discounts on trusts, index funds, or any of the rest of the bread and butter of this site. So that will always be the priority here. 🙂
@Vic #29: @xxd09, @TI and I have been discussing Ukraine recently here:
https://monevator.com/weekend-reading-in-a-m-a-d-world-all-correlations-go-to-one/
[NB: threads get locked after about 3 years now I believe.]
FWIW, IMHO the question for investors today is have ‘events’ (whether they be geopolitical, and/or epidemiological, and/or technological, and/or economic) shifted the investing world into a new gear – i.e. have we gone from low and slow (inflation, rates, growth) to higher and faster, or to something in-between, or indeed something different altogether.
@ The Investor
That’s fair comment, however this week’s events are far bigger than Brexit bickering and likely to be transformational for the European economy and its position geopolitically. 
I gloss over the Brexit stuff as it’s been flogged to death here. The fall of the North Atlantic Treaty is bigger stuff and more far reaching however.
I gloss over the Brexit stuff as it’s been flogged to death here. The fall of the North Atlantic Treaty is bigger stuff and more far reaching however.
I agree but I also see Brexit and Trump as highly related, both directly (rise of populism and misinformation, little accountability, lack of punishment by voters for fanciful promises that are in no way enacted in office / on-the-ground, no acceptance for direct and negative outcomes — 6 Jan in US / GDP hit in UK) and indirectly (Brexit was the first proof of concept of the above, better informed people than me (but also me FWIW) said it would weaken the Europe’s posture versus our enemies etc).
This is the new politics, it’s all related, and it’s not good for weaker nations nor weaker citizens alike.
It’s bigger than 2016, or indeed any year specific start date trend, although the shocks of 2008/9 are perhaps the most immediate reverberation. But these things have been around for a long long time. 
In the US, Nixon’s Southern strategy won election/reelection in 1968/72. 
Regan created the coalition with the evangelicals in 1981 and introduced the Austrian school into government (voodoo economics as George Bush Snr called it out). 
Recession, riots, Perot and a boring candidate did it in for the Reps in 1992 but Clinton had to govern from the right economically because of debt phobia and tried to build a coalition of white collar professionals, moderates and progressives on culture issues whilst ignoring blue collar. That was a foundational error. 
In 1994 Reaganism had metastasized into Pat Buchanan and Newt Gingrich. 
Then after the shock of 9-11 the neo-cons briefly had their day, but ostensibly liberal intervention (the new imperialism??) and ‘nation building’ (demolition??) never really suited the stay at home American temperament (until 9-11 required them for rentry from Canada and Mexico, only 10% of US citizens had a passport). 
After the shock to conservatives and frankly racists of the Obama wins in 2008 and 2012 and with the unwind in growth in the 2010s we got the Tea Party and then a MAGA- Trump cult coming down the golden escalator in 2015. 
The rest is history as they say. 
But the trends go way back. 
The militia movement. Segregationist George Wallace running for President in 1968, ultra hawk Barry Goldwater in 1964 and technocrat Perot in 1992. The John Birch society and McCarthyism in the 1950s. The resistance to the New Deal and joining the European war from 1933 to 1940 (including the attempted White House Putsch or Business Plot to use the army in 1933 to topple Roosevelt and install retired Marine corp general Smedley Butler as dictator). 
These things have happened before. They can happen again. 
The appearance of relative stability in international and economic affairs (which was illusory at the time) from 1992 to 2007 is not a norm to which the world naturally will revert. 2016 was a symptom, not a cause. 
Granted it marked another forking of the path for the UK, but not a new world disorder. Think Billy Joel and ‘We Didn’t Start the Fire”.
@Delta Hedge — Absolutely, of course I am not saying Brexit *started* all this out of the blue. I said ‘proof of concept’ 🙂
IMHO however it did fire the starting gun on what was possible. I am 100% certain it was relished in Moscow and Beijing, and in the 2016 campaign war room of Mar-a-Lago for that matter. 
Leave voters need to take responsibility for that — as do Trumpists.
Vote for political outsiders disdainful of social/establishment norms who promise to kick over said establishment, and you can’t complain when they kick stuff over I’m afraid.
Whether that be self-inflicted damage to the economy here in the UK, or mobs running rampant in the US capital only to be later pardoned, or indeed the ripping up of long-held alliances carefully nurtured by previous generations of ‘elites’.
Supporters of this populist wave can hardly complain at the consequences (though they do, here’s Nial Ferguson the other day for example: https://x.com/nfergus/status/1892480165546012776)
I *can* complain because I voted for none of it. In fact did my tiny bit in resisting it.
@TI, That George H Bush quote doesn’t carry even half of the weight Niall Ferguson puts on it.
Two months later, Oct’ 1990, the elder Assad sent his military into Lebanon to expel Michel Aoun from the presidential palace. Hundreds died, many after surrendering. Not a peep from the Americans as it was the price for Syria joining the anti-Saddam coalition.
@TI, @Azamino (#35, 36):  One doesn’t need to be signed up to Mearsheimer’s version of realism (or cynicism, depending on your PoV) to see that there’s always subterfuge, deceit and double dealing going on in international relations*. 
It’s not as though Nial Ferguson is some starry eyed liberal or lefty idealist status quo ‘disruptor’ who feels let down by the baser instincts of the populist MAGA wave here (he’s just finished writing up on Kissinger, the elitist architect of Realpolitik, after all, and is a senior fellow of the right wing Hoover Institute). 
International affairs has always been a hypocritical and murky business. Judge them by their deeds not their actions. 
Even so, Trump is not a refreshing breath of honesty, but rather a shameless bully without any moral compass. 
No modern day Nixon or Bismarck here in the White House. Just the shallow self dealing and grift of the long con. 
*Syrian and Iraqi Ba’athists hated each other with an intensity known only to the internecine strife amongst former comrades. In 1978 then Iraqi President al-Bakr and Syria’s Hafez al-Assad agreed treaties that would have lead to the unification of Iraq and Syria by July 1979. Saddam, then Deputy Secretary of the Iraqi Ba’ath Party, forced al-Bakr to retire and then derailed the union proposal with unreasonable demands of the Syrians. al-Assad’s support for the Coalition against Saddam in 1990-91 was payback. In one of those strange quirks of history, Syrian philosopher Michel Aflaq, who’d created the Ba’athist ideology in 1947, backed the Iraqis, who’d given him refuge from his estranged Syrian ex colleagues since 1968, right until his death in 1989.
Non-US NATO combined GDP is $27.5 tn, and the EU has provided approximately $145 billion in combined military, financial, humanitarian and other assistance to Ukraine since the war began. 
So, reducing the 0.7% of GDP foreign aid target (set back in the 1980 Brandt Commission report, before either China industrialised or Indian growth took off) by the equivalent of 0.2% of non-US NATO area combined GDP should cover the shortfall in support to Ukraine if Trump now cuts off all forms of US assistance.
No need to try and stretch for a 3% of GDP defence spend (which I doubt we’ll reach anyway). 
Ukraine will do the hard lifting of declawing the Russian bear for us. 
They’re more than willing to, and it’s cost effective for us.
@BBlimp — The joke — and your pointless trolling — isn’t funny anymore, and ‘funny’ is doing a lot of heavy lifting there. Deleted.
Interesting times indeed
Reminds me of my teens in the 60s -3 minute warnings etc
The French currently offering to move some of their “Force de Frappe” -nuclear armed planes to German airbases
My brother was a Buccaneer pilot in the RAF in the 70s -80s-carrying a stand off nuclear tactical bomb for dealing with massed Russian Tank and Infantry attacks-flew at between 50-100 ft above the German plain to avoid Russian radar
I once asked him what were his thoughts about carrying and delivering such a device
He said not to worry -our pilots were so good that the Russians would never come which turned out to be true
It does  seem here we go again sadly-hopefully our deterrence will be as good as back then

Excellent link @Azamino. It did feel like that, living through Cold War 2 (1979-84). Collapse Detente & SALT II, Afghanistan, ‘Evil Empire’, SDI and Soviet leaders dying one after the other like it was going out of fashion. I’m no appeaser, like DJT is, but we just can’t afford to go back to a world of 5% of GDP on defense. We’re an older nation with a worse dependency ratio, going post growth. We have to do things on the cheap. A few billion extra p.a. for Ukraine to keep them in the ring, yes. British Army on the Rhine redux, no. Helping the victim, Ukraine, doesn’t mean going to the extreme of remilitarising. It means not abandoning the victim. Certainly Russia, the aggressor, is a menace, but she’s also a failed state. She’s never as strong as she looks. She’s never as weak as she looks.
Cheers for the shout out and the heads up of Saba’s beady eye on one of my investments (MCT), not that I’ve noticed a particularly high discount but well, let’s see. Some very interesting links, thanks!

Berlin Film Festival director Tricia Tuttle has voiced her concerns about the rise of the far-right as Germany gears up for a general election this Sunday in which the extreme right-wing, Elon Musk and JD Vance-backed AfD party is projected to make significant gains.

	“I don’t know anyone that has an interest in a pluralistic society that values difference, that isn’t worried about what’s happening with the rise of the far-right, because that’s the antithesis of that. It’s about closing down and fearing difference. I’m as worried as a lot of other people are here,” she said

	Questioned on whether she would reconsider her role at the public-funded festival if AfD were to gain any sort of administrative influence in Germany, Tuttle said it would depend on whether she was able to continue the mission she was hired for.

	










			Watch on Deadline		






	“I’m here at the Berlinale to build a dynamic, international film festival that shows off German cinema on an international stage and also energizes local audiences. But if the country wants something that’s more domestic and the government changes, then I’m not the right person for that,” she said.  

	Like its first edition in 1951 – a year in which East-West tensions were high over the future of Berlin and the Korean War – the 75th Berlinale, running from February 13 to 23, has also unfolded in tumultuous times.

	Beyond Sunday night’s elections, in which AfD are predicted to come in second, Germany and its European allies are getting to grips with the destabilizing force of newly elected President Donald Trump as he attempts to strong-arm a Russia-Ukraine peace deal and force Palestinians out of Gaza, straining long-standing transatlantic alliances in the process.

	Against this backdrop, some 200 films have been playing in more than 30 venues across Berlin.  Many have reflected the times, from opening picture The Light, about a liberal-minded Berlin family grappling with the new age of uncertainty, and Michel Franco’s Dreams, tackling the U.S.-Mexico migrant stand-off, to Radu Jude’s Kontinental ’25, delving into corruption, nationalism and racism in his home country of Romania, and Kateryna Gornostai’s Timestamp, about the effects of war on everyday life in Ukraine.

	U.S-born festival exec Tuttle, who was previously head of the BFI London Film Festival, was speaking to Deadline in the closing days of her well-received inaugural edition as director of the Berlinale, having taken up the post in spring 2024 when the event was in disarray.

	










	By contrast, the vibe this year, as the festival celebrates its 75th edition, has been broadly positive with international industry professionals and local spectators alike embracing Tuttle.

	“I’m feeling completely exhausted but happy and proud of my team. I set myself lots of goals, and I feel like I achieved them with the team,” said Tuttle.

	“It’s also been hard in lots of ways, it always is, but I loved the hundreds of people coming up to me – audiences, press – who connected with the films and that’s what it’s all about.”

	Incoming goals included securing the budget; modernizing and expanding the festival’s infrastructure; building a team – which saw her appoint Jacqueline Lyanga and Michael Stütz as her immediate programming deputies – and connecting with the German film industry.

	“I wanted to connect with the German industry because I need that support, and I had to understand how I can support German distributors and exhibitors and filmmakers in a way that feels right for an international festival,” she says.

	“I had to do all that very quickly so I could then focus on the program and deliver the kind of program that I wanted to.”

	Tuttle, who was hired on a five-year contract, suggests her first edition has laid a good foundation for her longer-term plan for the festival.

	“I have a very good sense of the direction of travel and what I want to do with the festival in my five years that I have here. What we did this year is definitely moving in that direction,” she said.

	“We want to create an incredibly diverse program that has a lot of energy to it. I see it as a welcoming and warm cinephilia that everybody’s invited to. I love that lots of people are seeing different films… arguing about films and disagreeing about films, but also that they’re doing that in a way that is really lively. I’ve also enjoyed having the glamor and excitement of some big international stars here. I think that does add something and also opens the festival up to new people.”

	Stars hitting the red carpet this year as part of the Berlinale Special gala line-up included Timothée Chalamet for James Mangold’s Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown; Robert Pattinson in Bong Joon Ho’s long-awaited sci-fi comedy Mickey 17, as well as Liu Haocun and Wen QI for Chinese director Vivian Qu’s Girls on Wire, for whom fans travelled from across Europe.

	Tuttle reveals that the festival redesigned the entrance to the Berlinale Palast this year to lengthen the red carpet and enlarge the audience pen which she believes boosted the atmosphere.

	“There so much energy and a lot of excitement,” she says.

	“For Girls on Wire, the crowd pen response to the young stars of the film was super exciting. Yesterday, we screened Timestamp, and the pen was full of Ukrainians. It was really so moving and so beautiful to be there,” she adds.

	Tuttle acknowledges that the buzzy premieres for Searchlight Pictures’ A Complete Unknown and Warner Bros.-backed Mickey 17, will likely set the festival in good stead for securing studio titles next year.

“Every single one of our filmmakers who worked with us, who I’ve talked to, really, really loved their experiences at the Berlinale,” she said.

	“I don’t want to talk about specific conversations, but I’ve had a lot of positive feedback about how it felt and how impactful it was for the films. I think we’ve done a lot of work that will help us build a stronger program next year.”

	










	Beyond dealing with the budget, infrastructure and the program, a major challenge for Tuttle has been ensuring that the Berlinale, which has a reputation for being the most political of Europe’s A-list film festivals,  remains a platform for free speech at the same time as fostering respectful dialogue. 

	She and her team have attempted to head-off a repeat of last year’s edition in which opposing views over the Israel-Palestine conflict, spilled into the opening night, with winners and jury members criticizing Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, sparking accusations of antisemitism by local politicians, with briefings and posts laying out the festival’s stance and protocol on free speech.

	In spite of these efforts, the festival is currently grappling with the fall-out from a pro-Palestinian speech by Hong Kong filmmaker Jun Li, which is now subject to a police investigation after an audience member reported him for using language which is potentially banned under German law. 

	Tuttle says the festival remains committed to protecting free speech within the bounds of German law, but admits it has been one of the most challenging aspects of her job this year. 

	“German law around free speech is pretty open and broad, but there are definitely laws around hate speech and laws around antisemitism that are different from state to state, and they’re also being defined by court cases,” she said.

	“I’ve tried to communicate, with my team, as clearly as we can with people about court precedents, so that people understand what can be said here and what can’t. Even though it can be very hard, we really believe in people being able to speak about the world, but also stress the need to be culturally sensitive,” she continued. 

	“That doesn’t mean don’t speak, it means if you want people to listen to you, try to speak so that people can hear what you’re saying. Communication is a two-way thing. Most of the people who’ve come to the festival this year have done that. I’ve seen many places where people have had interesting, profound, difficult conversations, and where the audience has contributed too. It’s tough. I don’t think it’s a losing battle, but it’s very, very difficult and probably the hardest part of my job.”

	Tuttle herself courted controversy around the Israel-Palestine conflict when she joined a red carpet vigil on the opening night for Israeli Gaza hostage David Cunio, whose story is captured in Tom Shoval’s moving personal work A Letter to David which played in the festival. This show of support angered some pro-Palestinian guests who saw it as partisan.

	Tuttle stands by her action alluding to comments by Tilda Swinton, who was at the festival this year to received an Honorary Golden Bear, and made an impassioned political speech on the opening night. 

	“I understand that sense of not feeling visible. I really, really get it but Tilda said it: being for someone doesn’t mean being against someone else. There was a vigil happening on my red carpet, one that I didn’t organize, but I’m empathetic towards David Cunio and what his family are going through. He’s an alumni filmmaker. I feel that is an appropriate thing for me to show solidarity and empathy with,” said Tuttle.

	“But that doesn’t mean that I’m also not deeply, deeply sad about all of the lives lost in Gaza and the fact that the world’s most powerful politician is threatening to expel people from their land. We can show empathy for many, many, many different people.”

	










	Beyond politics, Tuttle’s first year in the job appears to have met with approval from local audiences, with the festival posting a 5% rise in ticket sale results up until last Wednesday, although she batted back a suggestion that it is due to her arrival in the festival director role.

	“I don’t think that has ever been the festival’s problem,” she said

	“The festival has an incredibly loyal, interested and engaged local audience. Last year, there were 325,000 tickets sold, so this year is a little higher than that. The Berlinale’s incredible audience, that’s definitely not one of the things we want to renew or fix.”

	That said, Tuttle has put in place a number of initiatives aimed at bringing in new audiences, such as streaming the opening night into seven cinemas across Germany and the new Hub 75, hosting a free program of morning talks and events.

	“All film festivals are a bubble because this is where we’re showing some of the most adventurous cinema. These aren’t necessarily the films that will get huge, wide distribution. It’s a creative and artistic intervention. It’s about igniting people, getting people excited about different kinds of cinema. I’m really interested in how we welcome new audiences, but I don’t think you change your program to do that,” explained Tuttle. 

	“You change your sense of welcome and makes things easier to navigate. You find doors and windows to open. It’s not about radically reinventing yourself. I have seen in other jobs that that can have a real ripple effect. What I’m aiming for over four, five years, is that new people who maybe don’t know the Berlinale or think it’s not for them will start to come.”

	Other innovations include the launch of the new competitive Perspectives sidebar championing 14 first films, with highlights including The Settlement by Mohamed Rashad, BLKNWS: Terms & Conditions by Kahlil Joseph, Little Trouble Girls by Urska Djukic and Balint Daniel Sos’s Growing Down.  

	“It 100% worked,” says Tuttle as she appraises the inaugural run. “It made all the nominations more visible and did very much what we wanted to do with the section. I’m very committed to it. Everybody’s got a different idea about how to run the festival, but this is really part of what I want to do. Of course, I want feedback but right now what I’m hearing overwhelmingly is that it worked for the filmmakers as well as audiences and buyers.”

	The Berlinale’s parallel European Film Market was equally buzzy with its main venues of the Gropius Bau and Marriott Hotel packed out with people taking meetings, although transactional news was slow on the ground.

	“The major headline deals, there weren’t so many of them, but I suspect that’s more about where the industry is right now than the market (EFM) itself. I think it’s taking longer to get the deals worked out, so we’re not getting that sort of lightning strike moment in any market or any festival right now,” commented Tuttle.

	“But what I heard from mid-sized independent distributors, who pick up bigger art house titles, is that it was a very, very positive market for them. They were really excited,” she continued.  “The sellers of those works also seem seemed happy but I think it’s a tough period. In the last quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, there’s been some positive signs with independent exhibition and a wider range of films doing well, but we still have a long way to go for recovery, and what we’re seeing is that everybody’s very cautious.”

86,2025-02-22,"Consider me an oddball when it comes to voice command tech. Sure, I’d make an odd command using my voice on my phone every now and then but that’s more or less it. To do it when I’m going down the road on my motorcycle is just plain crazy.
The likes of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto already come as standard on premium motorcycles but what Kawasaki is offering is a step further. And it requires you to subscribe to the service.
The Japanese bikemaker has not only created its own voice command system but also integrated it with Cerence voice recognition software. This new tech reportedly comes with 18 distinct voice commands, including making phone calls, playing music, tracking the bike's statistics, accessing navigation, and even checking the weather.
And for all of this, you will be able to operate a variety of features without removing your hands from the handlebars. But there’s a catch.
In contrast to other motorcycles that use pre-existing smartphone aids, you'll have to pay for Kawasaki's technology through an annual subscription.
But here’s the interesting bit: the license for the feature is linked to the owner and not the motorcycle. This means that if you own more than one Kawasaki motorcycle, you will be able to utilize the feature on all of your bikes. If you do intend to ever sell your bike, the new owner will need to buy their own subscription.
In order to use Kawasaki's voice command system, you'd require a smartphone running at least iOS 15 or Android 11 with 3 GB of RAM and 2 GB of free storage, as well as a Bluetooth headset with a microphone. Compared to current voice command options, such as those integrated with Cardo or Sena communicators, these requirements add a layer of complexity, even though they are not particularly demanding.
But here's the thing: what about road safety? The primary argument in favor of voice commands is that by keeping hands on the handlebars, they'd help minimize distractions. Voice commands while riding, however, still require cognitive effort, which still requires you to divert your attention from the road.
Sure, many motorcycle riders already communicate via Bluetooth headsets, but most of these headsets are pretty straightforward and don't require any additional effort. Adding an additional layer of engagement could raise cognitive burden and pose safety hazards.
Not just that; the introduction of a pay-to-use feature calls into question Kawasaki's intentions. Is this a tactic to keep riders in the Kawasaki ecosystem or is it an effort to improve the user experience? It also begs the question of whether consumers will have to pay more simply to use a function that other brands already offer as standard.
Free voice assistants are already available to most riders via their cell phones, and Bluetooth communicators offer comparable features at no extra cost. A niche percent of the overall market may find it appealing to pay an annual fee to communicate with your motorcycle, but many riders, including me, would view this as an unnecessary investment.
If Kawasaki were to offer more than just voice commands with the subscription model, it would make more sense. Proactive maintenance alerts, real-time bike diagnostics, or even AI-driven ride feedback are all counterintuitive features people would consider paying for.
Right now, though, it appears that this is an attempt to charge riders for a service that they might get for free elsewhere.

This feature, which we suspect is drastically underutilized, has recently received a design refresh with sleek, uniform, pill-shaped icons. It’s far more than a simple search tool; think of it as a versatile visual assistant. Simply circle or tap on an object to get an instant AI overview. Need to identify a catchy tune playing nearby or even from your phone’s speakers? 
Just tap the music icon. Want to translate an entire screen on the fly? The translation icon has you covered. And here are a couple of handy tips: if the Google search bar is obstructing your view, you can move it by dragging it with two fingers. You can also select text within images or scan QR codes directly. Circle to Search is a true game-changer, and if you’re not using it regularly, you’re missing out on a significant boost in efficiency.
Did you know you can place individual app shortcuts directly on your homescreen? 
So long-pressing an app icon reveals a list of shortcuts. But by long-pressing a specific action, you can drag it to your homescreen for one-tap access. This is technically not a feature limited to Pixel phones, but it lets you do things like add shortcuts for YouTube search, subscriptions, or Shorts, or quickly start new conversations or jump into existing threads in Messages. 
Google Keep users will love the ability to create new notes, lists, photo notes, or audio notes with a single tap. The possibilities are endless, especially with third-party apps, allowing you to tailor your homescreen to your exact needs.
For Pixel users, Private Space is a must-try. Introduced in Android 15, it creates a separate, secure area for specific apps and their data. This is perfect for hiding sensitive data and managing distractions. Personally, I use Private Space to control my distractions. Social media apps, stock apps, and other time-consuming apps reside here, creating a barrier and encouraging intentional access.
If you plan on keeping your Pixel for years, the “Limit to 80%” feature in Android 15’s charging optimization settings is crucial. Charging to 100% can degrade battery health over time, and limiting charge cycles at higher voltages preserves battery health. While you’ll have 20% less battery per charge, the long-term benefits are significant.
Photography enthusiasts will appreciate the hidden quick-access controls for white balance, brightness, and shadows. Enable this feature in the camera app’s settings under “More Settings,” then “Quick access controls.” Tapping the viewfinder focuses the camera and displays sliders for quick adjustments.
If you own a Pro Pixel phone and a Pixel Tablet, “Hold close to cast” is a fantastic – nay exceptional – feature. Requiring a 6 Pro, 7 Pro, 8 Pro, 9 Pro, or Pixel Fold, this feature allows you to easily transfer media by holding your phone close to a docked Pixel Tablet on the same Wi-Fi network. Enable it in your Google account settings under “All services” and “Cast options.”
Finally, for Gemini users, the Utilities extension is a powerful tool for managing your device. It offers comprehensive control, allowing you to open apps, control media, perform multiple actions, and more. You can even use it on the lock screen to set alarms and timers, toggle the flashlight, Bluetooth, and DND. Screenshot management is also a breeze, especially useful for Pixel 9 series users.

95,2025-02-22,"Morse Micro’s Wi-Fi HaLow router enables stable 16km connectivity

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Morse Micro has introduced the MM-HL1-EXT, a Wi-Fi HaLow router with an external antenna designed for long-range, low-power communication.
The MM-HL1-EXT leverages the IEEE 802.11ah Wi-Fi HaLow standard, enabling connections over distances of 10 miles (16km) in rural areas and 3km in urban environments.
Unlike conventional Wi-Fi routers, HaLow operates in the 900MHz band in the US and also supports 2.4GHz Wi-Fi 4 (802.11n). It can function as a standalone access point or as an extender, improving connectivity in difficult-to-reach areas.
The MM-HL1-EXT is part of the HaLowLink 1 series — optimized for IoT and industrial applications.
It's been certified for use in North America (FCC), Canada (IC), and Australia (RCM) but the company is working to secure certifications for EMEA (868MHz) and Asia.
“The certification of the HaLowLink 1 reinforces the growing importance of reliable, interoperable Wi-Fi HaLow products in the connectivity ecosystem,” said Maureen Gallagher, VP of Marketing at Wi-Fi Alliance.
“With its extended range and low-power capabilities, Wi-Fi HaLow is a powerful solution for IoT applications, and Morse Micro is committed to accelerating adoption by delivering high-quality products through the Wi-Fi CERTIFIED program.”
Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!
At the core of the HaLowLink 1 is the MediaTek MT7621A dual-core CPU, paired with 256MB of DRAM and 32MB of NAND flash storage. The radio module features Morse Micro’s MM6108 chipset alongside AzureWave AW-HM593, delivering a transmission power of up to 23 dBm for stable, long-range performance.
For wired connections, the router includes two Gigabit Ethernet ports and supports Ethernet-over-USB for enhanced networking flexibility. A USB-C port provides power and Ethernet data transmission.
It runs on OpenWrt 23.05, an open source, customizable networking platform that supports online firmware updates.
The HaLowLink 1 speed maxes out at 32Mbps when using an 8MHz bandwidth. In contrast, its Wi-Fi 4 capability supports speeds of up to 300Mbps at 40MHz bandwidth.
In harsh industrial settings, two HaLowLink 1 units can be deployed together to replace Ethernet cabling, providing a wireless alternative to outdoor and remote installations.
“With the launch of the world’s first Wi-Fi 4 and Wi-Fi HaLow CERTIFIED gateway, we’re equipping developers with a powerful tool to explore the extended-range, low-power connectivity benefits of Wi-Fi HaLow, paving the way for widespread adoption,” said Michael De Nil, co-founder and CEO of Morse Micro.

Morse Micro has been developing Wi-Fi HaLow tech for nearly a decade, but its breakthroughs only began gaining widespread attention in 2024. Back in February of that year, it demonstrated router hardware that provided 2-mile coverage for months while running on coin batteries.
By September, that range had extended to 10 miles. Most recently, at CES 2025 in January, Morse Micro showcased Wi-Fi routers capable of delivering 250Mbps over a 10-mile radius.

MSNBC‘s new chief isn’t wasting any time in figuring out where she wants to take the progressive-leaning network as it prepares to be spun off from NBCUniversal and its corporate parent, Comcast.

Rebecca Kutler, who was named president of MSNBC earlier in February, is considering expanding the on-screen presence of Jen Psaki, who currently anchors hours on Sunday afternoons and Monday evenings, as well as the trio of personalities who lead “The Weekend,” the roundtable show that airs Saturday and Sunday mornings and is led by Symone Sanders-Townsend, Alicia Menendez and Michael Steele, according to two people familiar with the discussions.

	MSNBC declined to make Kutler available for comment. Puck previously reported discussions around the aforementioned personnel moves.

	










	The changes, none of which have been formally announced, show Kutler moving quickly to steer MSNBC in a tricky moment. With Comcast splitting off the bulk of its cable assets into a separate, publicly-traded company, MSNBC is likely to have to navigate a future cut off from the newsgathering resources of NBC News. At present, a group of traditional news anchors, including Katy Tur and Chris Jansing, fill MSNBC’s weekday hours, offering reporting and journalism that isn’t as dipped in blue as the outlet’s primetime opinion programs. Veteran Andrea Mitchell recently signed off from the noon hour she anchored for decades, and an official replacement has not been unveiled.

	It’s possible that Kutler may have to find new ways to fill those daytime hours. The executive is already at work on finding new Washington correspondents and a Washington bureau chief, according to one of the people familiar with the matter, and recent discussions have centered on the possibility of hiring journalists from outlets such as The Washington Post and Politico; bringing in names from other networks; and elevating current MSNBC contributors to anchor roles.

	Like other cable networks, MSNBC is facing significant business challenges. More of the viewers who settle in each evening to watch a few hours of commentary on MSNBC are migrating elsewhere. MSNBC is projected to shed approximately 10.5% of its subscribers between the end of 2023 and the end of 2025, according to estimates from Kagan, a market-research firm that is part of S&P Global Intelligence. Rivals Fox News Channel and CNN are seen experiencing similar erosions in that period. MSNBC could be left with an average of 61.3 million viewers at the end of 2025, compared with 68.5 million in 2023 — and this with an election year, typically an event that brings viewers back to news, between the two milestones.

	










	MSNBC has been working to bring viewers back after the results of the 2024 presidential election. Both MSNBC and CNN saw significant erosion following Donald Trump’s return to the White House and the national conversation, and both have unveiled programing shake-ups in recent weeks. At MSNBC, Rachel Maddow returned to hosting the 9 p.m. hour Monday through Friday, compared to the Monday-only schedule (with various special appearances) she has enjoyed in recent years. But Maddow is supposed to return to Mondays-only after Trump’s first 100 days in office, a move that would have also accommodated the return of Alex Wagner, who has been hosting Tuesdays through Fridays.

	Both Psaki and “The Weekend” are close to Kutler’s heart. She developed both the trio and “Inside With Jen Psaki.” “The Weekend” has seen a spike in viewership in its time slot since it launched in January of 2024. Executives at MSNBC have clearly been taken with Psaki, a former Biden White House press secretary, since she launched a Sunday hour in March of 2023.

	Giving both of those programs new space suggests MSNBC is eager to maintain its progressive stance, rather than trying to tack towards middle ground. And the moves would add diversity to the network’s weekday lineup. 

	But for those two shows to get more space, others may have to get less. Kutler is no doubt juggling her choices.
