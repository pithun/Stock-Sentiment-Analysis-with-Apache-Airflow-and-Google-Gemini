Reddit is now just a gathering ground for left leaning histrionic teenagers who dare not consider other worldviews exist.
The amount of echo-chambers and pile-ons for anyone who dares question just makes it bland, predictable, and sterile.

Reddit has gotten noticeably worse in the last year. There's massive problems with brigading and vote manipulation (for example: https://www.reddit.com/r/Repub...  [reddit.com]). Every subreddit has turned into /r/politics (look at https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumpe... [reddit.com]), moderators are banning anyone with an opinion right of Mao, and many subreddits ban p
If you did not make that post clear sarcasm then I would agree they did the right thing.

The effect would be fairly small though, as reddit has made a lot of mistakes with its users over the years and this is taking its toll.
Neither.  How about, ""the market has started to get over the idea that anything with ""AI"" is magically good?
Maybe some semblance of rationality is returning to the tech market.  Until the next buzzword.
We survived NFT, crypto, quantum, and countless others.  We will survive AI.
That is my take as well. ""We will use AI!"" is an indicator that a company is in trouble and more and more people are waking up to that reality.
I hope that will happen sooner than later. This year would be nice.
Hmm. Trump and Musk have to replace all these people they are currently firing somehow. I see a golden opportunity there!
Why do they have to replace all those people?  That is the point.  They don't need to be there at all.  They need to go get real jobs.
I have worked a few years at the DoE.  I look forward to seeing tens of billions clawed back from that mess.  Roughly 2/3rds of the people I worked with didn't need to be there.  The numbers fired so far are trivial compared to the fat that should be cut.  No one outside government will notice any of them missing.
You cannot just fire people with institutional knowledge and expect things to continue working. The processes may be massively inefficient, but if you fire the people that know how they work, you do not magically end up with efficient processes. You end up with no processes. And that means things are grinding to a halt and not only in government.
But you will see. Give it a few months and they will start to manufacture fake ""successes"" because nothing works anymore. Think Soviet-Union style ""success"" propaga 
Most of them don't do anything that should be done.
Their institutional knowledge is best forgotten and tossed in the trash.
Anecdote time: I knew this very nice lady at the DoE who was a ""tech"" worker who did the same nothing data entry job for 25 years.  Short version she copied data manually from one system to another that didn't talk to each other.  Then someone wrote a script.  She was given 3 months to find a new job but was telling me over lunch how her tech skills had completely rotted out and she did 
Sorry, but you _really_ do not know how an administration structure actually works. Not your fault, most engineers do not. I only really found out when I became a part-time IT and IT Security auditor. These structures are _fragile_ , complex, badly designed and badly documented (or not at all) and you cannot do without what they produce.
So this sounds all good and I am aware there is massive inefficiency, but an unprepared ""Big Bang"" replacement approach will not work and cannot work. Your anecdotes are nice, but do not reflect reality. The problem is not that these people you can just fire do not exist. (But have a look at all the effort even your anecdotes came with. And then think about how this times 10'000 or so could be done in parallel...) These people exist and they can be fired with some preparation and work. The problem is that you cannot identify them reliably, except in a careful, strategic, long-term fashion and with a plan of how things are supposed to work otherwise. A plan that needs to work and that you cannot really test. And a plan that is very, very complex. And if you do not reliably identify who can actually be fired and who cannot and what replacement processes you need to put in place before you fire them, you are bound to fire too many people and that will make everything collapse. Oh, and you need to do all that while you need help from the people you want to fire. Little, but critical detail.
A bureaucracy is like a house of cards: You can remove some cards with no issue. But remove the wrong ones without careful preparation and everything comes crashing down. Another picture would be to slim down Windows by randomly deleting files you think do not serve a purpose. Will that go well? No. And at some point, when nothing works anymore, you do not even know what files you would need to add again. And adding them, if you somehow magically know, might well not even fix things again.
Yes, I get that things are massively inefficient. But the direct approach of just firing people without very careful analysis and planning will make things so much worse. And that is why the only way to go about this that will not result in a complete catastrophe is very slowly and very carefully. Oh, and you need full political support for such a change, because you also need to change laws, regulations, liability, accountability and a few other things. Decrees will not work. This is change that needs several decades. Take less time and you _will_ fail. Take the full time and you may still fail, but you will at least likely not leave scorched earth.
Yes, that is not nice. But that is reality. Details matter. The higher the complexity, the more details matter. And the bureaucracy we are talking here is extremely complex.
I get what you're saying but it does not apply.  Most of these orgs literally should not exist and should not be doing any of the things they're doing.
If there are some things that (for example) USAID should be doing then someone at the state department can figure out who to send the check to and this year's check will be late.  It will not end the world if US tax dollars arrive late for some feel good program in another country.  It's charity, not strategically critical work.
Well, the damage from dismantling USAID will, at least in the short term, mostly hit in other places. Long-term, that remains to be seen.
But what about, say, the plans to dismantle the Department of Education? And all the badly prepared slimming down in other places?
So, yes, this very much applies.
Did education actually improve after the DoE was created?
The plan to remove the DoE is to push education policy back to the states.
Itâ(TM)s the right thing to do. If people in Mississippi find their religion-packed biology classes mean no jobs in the real world, then thatâ(TM)s up to them to fix.
 They don't need to be there at all. Elon Musk hastily rehires fired nuclear employees [google.com] 
Musk has no idea who he's firing or what they do. You have even less of an idea.

That is my take as well. ""We will use AI!"" is an indicator that a company is in trouble and more and more people are waking up to that reality.I wouldn't say it's outright ""company is in trouble"" so much as ""company is trend-hopping"" and if the announcement is happening right now, it's not just trend-hopping, it's trend-hopping so far behind the curve as to be splashing down in an empty pool.

This.  The AI search is a bad feature.   The point of reddit is to have actual people post and comment, raw and unprocessed content, in their own voice.  Making a synthetic amalgamation of the reddit community is antithetical to what makes reddit compelling.

Use of AI (LLM variant) means one thing these days: You cannot do. And hence you try to use AI to compensate. That this does not work becomes obvious to more and more people.
that the right word is ""Despite"" and not ""Because"".
I just put the words in place. Then the words sed it all for me.
And usually I'm just awkward with these things.
Personally, I think it is the promise of paywall content this year [arstechnica.com]. My guess is Millennials will just stick up their middle finger and jump to some Chinese government funded spyware/misinformware product like the soon to be meta FukTok (I hope that isn't real, guessing it is...).
Looking at their income statements since 2020, they've run losses every year, with 2024 seeing a huge spike to almost half a billion.
This is not Amazon. They aren't building vast warehouses in preparation for changing the world. They're failing to monetize, and at this point I don't know why we should trust that there is much potential for it. They've already built the roads needed to make money. They are not doing so. I don't understand their valuation.
Buying opportunity my ass.
They just up and set fire to their already suffering goodwill.
It's always been the case that the value of Reddit is literally it's users... and they just took a huge step forward in trying to eliminate their ""dependency"" on those users with AI, which was almost certainly trained on the very posts the users made.  Those users were neither asked for permission nor was any serious attempt made to inform them that their previous works were about to be used for an effort to replace them--effectively taking away their agency to keep Reddit in check by withdrawing from the site if the environment became too toxic.
This isn't really a matter of copyright, per se.  It's strictly a matter of the social contract under which Reddit benefitted always had the restriction that they couldn't screw over the users because if they drove the users away, Reddit would be ""done"".  They tried to break that social contract and keep the benefit of having active, knowledgeable and engaged users without the responsibility of providing a reasonable place for those users to meet and communicate.  That's taking agency from users, which is counter to everything else Reddit represents and objectively evil, so of course their value dropped.

China's 'Salt Typhoon' Hackers Continue to Breach Telecoms Despite US Sanctions
You see but you do not observe.
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in ""The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes"""
2,2025-02-16,"Business Insider Edition 
Some of President Donald Trump's policy proposals are on a collision course with Telsa. However, Elon Musk appears to be betting the EV maker can weather any short-term storm clouds and come out ahead of the competition.

        On the tariffs front, Tesla CFO Vaibhav Taneja recently warned that the EV maker is ""very reliant"" on global parts and Trump's proposed tariffs are expected to impact the company's ""business and profitability.""
    

Tesla has a lot to potentially gain from Musk's close relationship with President Donald Trump.Musk, for his part, has largely appeared to shrug off the possible impact of some of Trump's other proposed policy changes, such as ending the Biden-era EV mandate.
    

        ""At this point, I think that sustainable transport is inevitable,"" Musk said on Tesla's most recent earnings call when asked about any potential impact on the company if wider EV adoption slowed. The move to electric vehicles ""can't be stopped,"" he added.
    

        Tesla analysts told Business Insider that Musk appears to be taking the long-term view and that any negative short-term impacts would likely be outweighed by the potential benefits of working closely with Trump — such as gaining an ally in deregulation and formalizing a federal framework for autonomous driving.
    

        ""It's really all about autonomous driving,"" CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson told BI.
    

        Nelson said a streamlined regulatory process for autonomous vehicles that supersedes state-level approval programs would be ""the biggest positive"" for Tesla. Nelson said he expects it to happen by the end of the year.
    

        Trump has also indicated a willingness to flex political pressure on European regulators over the regulations they have in place that impact American companies operating in the market.
    

        Musk recently singled out European regulations as a key constraint in executing Tesla's vision for fully autonomous vehicles. Musk has said solving autonomy is key to growing Tesla's market cap.
    

        ""Europe is a layer cake of regulations of bureaucracy, which, that really needs to be addressed,"" Musk said on the earnings call. ""This is a like America innovates, Europe regulates.""
    

        Tesla's stock went on a tear in the month following Trump's election victory, surging to an all-time high in mid-December. And after Tesla's quarterly earnings in January revealed profit and revenue below analysts' expectations, the stock also rose around 8% amid Musk's bold predictions for the coming year.
    

        ""He understands that having the government on his side yields the company a lot of power among the big funds and analysts,"" Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com told BI.
    

        Some of the tariffs that Tesla's CFO warned would impact the EV maker have since been made official — however, there's uncertainty on how long they will remain in place.
    

        Trump's 10% tariffs on imports from China have gone into effect, though his previously announced 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada have been put on hold after the countries' leaders made concessions.
    

        The president also announced on Monday new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, which are both commonly used for auto parts.
    

        In a recent note to investors, Tom Narayan, lead equity analyst of global autos at RBC Capital Markets, said that if the steel and aluminum tariffs are made permanent, auto companies could face headwinds in 2027 or 2028. However, he also said that Trump imposed a 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminum during his last term and ended up making exceptions for Canada, Mexico, and Brazil, the largest steel importers to the US.
    

        In general, tariffs would impact ""all the US auto manufacturers,"" said CFRA Research's Nelson. However, Nelson said Tesla's competitors may be more ""exposed"" — like General Motors, which has significant production and sourcing in Mexico and China.
    

        That doesn't mean Tesla would be unaffected though.
    

        Investing.com's Monteiro told BI that ""there's no question"" that ""Tesla's margins will be pressured"" in the coming quarters.
    

        While Tesla's final assembly takes place in the US, a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration filing indicated between 20% and 25% of the company's components from its 2025 model-year vehicles were sourced from Mexico. Tesla's 2023 Impact Report also shows that the company sources a number of materials abroad for its battery and auto parts production, including lithium, nickel, steel, and iron.
    

        Monteiro said further domesticating the supply chain would be expensive and the company's strategy of periodically reducing prices to sell more cars would ""become even worse from a financial standpoint.""
    

        ""To talk numbers, a 25% tariff would amount to a cost increase of around $1.5 billion in the first year,"" Monteiro estimated, adding that the cost would likely improve as company supply chains adapt.
    

        Trump has also talked about rolling back Biden's EV incentives, including the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022, which offers buyers a federal tax break of up to $7,500 for new EVs and a $4,000 credit for used EVs.
    

        While lowering the overall price of buying a Tesla has benefited the company, Musk has voiced support for eliminating EV tax credits on several occasions — something not all Tesla shareholders agree on.
    

        ""I think it would be devastating for our competitors and for Tesla slightly,"" Musk said in a July earnings call about the possibility of the tax credits ending. ""But long-term probably actually helps Tesla, would be my guess.""
    

        If he's right, the move could help Tesla maintain its dominance in the US EV market, especially after its estimated market share fell below 50% for the first time in July.
    

        Nelson said Musk's position is likely that Tesla has a strong brand value and its buyers tend to be higher income. That means the tax credits may not be ""as much a factor in their purchase decision,"" he said.
    

        Trump has also moved to repeal the Biden-era EV mandates, which aimed to boost EV adoption through investments in infrastructure like charging stations and stricter emission standards.
    

        On his first day back in office, Trump signed an executive order ""to eliminate the 'electric vehicle (EV) mandate' and promote true consumer choice."" The order calls for the removal of state emissions waivers that work to limit sales of auto vehicles and other government policies that ""favor EVs over other technologies,"" mandating their purchase by making ""other types of vehicles unaffordable.""
    

        When asked on social media over the summer about Trump's proposed EV policies, Musk said at the time that, ""It will be fine"" and wrote that ""a surprising number of people think that Tesla survives on subsidies.""
    

        ""That is true of our competitors, but not of Tesla,"" he wrote in July.
    

        However, pulling back Biden's EV mandates on emissions targets threatens Tesla's revenue stream from selling regulatory credits to automakers that fail to meet federal and state EV sales targets.
    

        In the fourth quarter, Tesla reported $692 million in revenue from these credits.
    

        ""There's really no cost associated with that revenue, so it's basically got 100% margin and it flows right through the bottom line,"" Nelson said.
    

        Stephanie Valdez Streaty, a director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, previously told BI that, ""Tesla has relied on the credits to help really boost profitability.""
    

        ""If federal guidelines are less stringent, then other manufacturers have more time, and they're not going to need those credits as much, so I think it'll definitely impact it,"" she said.

3,2025-02-16,"Much of icy Greenland may soon go the way of the dodo, according to a group of researchers’ latest climatological analysis.
Soon is a relative term, but the team posits that just a few degrees of temperature change could put the second-largest ice sheet on Earth into a death spiral, catalyzing over 20 feet (6.1 meters) of global sea level rise and drastic changes to the immediate marine environment. The team’s research was published in The Cryosphere.
Greenland’s ice sheet is one of two on Earth, the other spanning Antarctica. Combined, the two ice sheets contain more than 68% of Earth’s fresh water, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Greenland’s ice sheet covers 656,000 square miles (1.7 million square kilometers), or about 80% of the island. The ice is over 1.9 miles (3 km) thick in places and if the entire sheet melted, sea levels would rise 24 feet (7.4 meters).
In its work, the team used a climate model to simulate how different climates would affect Greenland’s surface massâin other words, they applied different climate scenarios to see how quickly or slowly the Greenland ice sheet would melt. The team found the tipping point for Greenland’s ice sheet occurs when approximately 230 gigatons of ice is lost in a single year, which corresponds to a 60% decrease from the pre-industrial equilibrium for the ice sheet. That event would be the point of no return for Greenland’s ice, which would completely disappear in a relatively short period (between 8,000 years and 40,000 years, according to Science X Network).
All of this sounds very hypothetical, until you consider that the team ties that threshold to a global temperature increase of 6.12 degrees Fahrenheit (3.4 degrees Celsius) compared to pre-industrial levels.
The team’s findings come on the heels of a Nature paper published last year that found that calving from the landmass’s ice sheet ubiquitously accelerated between 1985 and 2022. Furthermore, last year’s team found that previous research underestimated mass losses from Greenland by as much as 20%, and the mass loss the team reported had “minimal direct impact on global sea level but is sufficient to affect ocean circulation and the distribution of heat energy around the globe.”
Greenland is in the zeitgeist because of President Trump’s repeated claims about wanting to buy Greenland from Denmark. Greenland has been part of Denmark for six centuries; though it gained its autonomy in 1979 and has its own local government, the island is a territory of Denmark.
Trump’s insistence has prompted silly moves from his political allies and followers; yesterday, Congressman Buddy Carter of Georgia (no relation to Georgia native and former U.S. President Jimmy Carter) introduced H.R.1161, a bill meant to “authorize the President to enter into negotiations to acquire Greenland and to rename Greenland as ‘Red, White, and Blueland’.” The bill is a reminder of how much of American politicking is performative grandstanding, and not done in service of political representatives’ constituents.
It may be thousands of years before such a tipping pointâand given that the team’s work was a simulation, there’s still plenty of time for humankind to right the ship. But the study shows one plausible scenario should global warming continue at its current rateâa worrying sign whether you are in the market for Greenland or are simply an Earthling.

by  Abigail Bassett
The all-in-one ECU was designed in-house in the hopes of making BMW’s new EV stand above the crowd.
by  Abigail Bassett
Last November, I strapped into the rear passenger seat of an all-electric, four-door sedan with BMW test driver and 24-hour racer Jens Klingmann behind the wheel. It was a cold day at BMW’s Performance Driving Center in Greer, SC, and beneath the five-point harnesses, roll cage, and heavily camouflaged body, Klingmann had an unexpected co-pilot: a tiny black box called the “Heart of Joy.”
It was an odd name for an interesting suite of tech features powering my brief three-lap stint on the 1.7-mile performance track. The Heart of Joy represents an interesting future for the German brand that still wants to be known as the “Ultimate Driving Machine” in the electrified future. 
The vehicle we rode in is called the Vision Driving Experience (VDX), a one-off built specifically for testing this supposedly magic black box, as well as more upcoming features for BMW’s Neue Klasse platform. The VDX uses fans to suck it down to the track for better traction at speed. Those fans are loud inside the vehicle, making it nearly impossible to hear much more than a roar while we’re hurtling around the track at speeds nearing 90 mph, even though the car itself is a mostly silent EV.
In the skilled hands of Klingmann, the tires whine as they approach the limit of their grip. There’s notably less BMW brake squeal as that little black box does a majority of the work as we hurtle around the track. 
The Heart of Joy is an ECU that combines both driving dynamics and powertrain control into one computer. Approximately eight-inches by eight-inches, the box will serve as the control module for the upcoming Neue Klasse electrified vehicles that will start rolling out later this year.
It was developed in-house by BMW engineers, which is unique since most manufacturers cobble together hundreds of off-the-shelf components and write software code to make them all communicate seamlessly with one another. That results in a sort of homogeneity of driving experiences across different brands since most brands use the same suppliers. So BMW tasked its engineers with thinking about how to differentiate its EVs from the competition by coming up with a new, single computing system that could power a variety of driving dynamics across BMW’s lineup – from SUVs to sports cars.
“The question is, what does driving pleasure look like in an era of electrification?” Christian Thalmeer, BMW’s senior driving dynamics engineer, said. “It combines the sheer power and torque of electric motors, with the ability for those motors to slow and brake a vehicle, and the option to have more than one power source.” 
On the track, the VDX is a rocketship, and even though we’re approaching 90 mph on the straight, Klingmann barely touches the brakes and simply lifts off the accelerator to bring the vehicle to a more sane speed for the sharp hairpins.
“The question is, what does driving pleasure look like in an era of electrification?”
BMW didn’t share all the specs of the VDX test vehicle, besides its insane 13,269 lb-ft of torque, and 25 percent increase in efficiency thanks to the integrated brake and energy recuperation. But they did share that the Heart of Joy is ten times faster than the strung-together ECUs on the market. 
One of the major features that BMW focused on in the development was braking and stability control. The system can actively use regenerative braking to bring BMW vehicles to a full stop without the driver ever having to touch the pedal. The company says that that feature will lead to more stability at the limit since the system can brake each individual wheel to create better grip resulting in recuperation that is 60 percent more efficient. 
Because a single computer system manages everything from driving dynamics to powertrain output to individual wheels, there will be less latency in the vehicle response, and you get less wear and tear on brakes and tires. Thalmeer said that the new ECU system can shift the power and deceleration from front to back and to each wheel to get the maximum recuperation and stability out of the vehicle, an event he calls the “joy of stopping.”
Heart of Joy was developed in just three short years and has currently been through more than 7,500 hours of testing, both at the hands of experienced engineers like Thalmeer and race drivers like Klingmann. The aim, of course, is to get future BMWs to drive more like BMWs, and not like, say, Kias, which uses the supplier-to-programming model for their EVs. The single computer also, conveniently, makes over-the-air updates much easier for BMW. 
Bringing the development in-house is not new for BMW, but it is relatively unique in an industry that frequently looks to outside suppliers for everything from voice recognition to infotainment. ECUs tend to be outsourced to other companies like Magna Steyr, for example. 
BMW CTO Frank Weber explained how the automaker’s near failure to launch the 7-series 25 years ago gave the company the ability and confidence to create the new Heart of Joy. “It was a nightmare,” Weber told me at CES earlier this year. “We almost didn’t make the launch of the car…Today, I can say, maybe this was the best thing that happened to BMW. Because it was so difficult, we had to develop more robust processes for those advanced digital technologies much earlier than the others, and then we just groomed it over time.” 
“We almost didn’t make the launch of the car…Today, I can say, maybe this was the best thing that happened to BMW.”
This led the company to believe it could tackle the difficult task of bringing the ECU creation in-house. “Being able to work with the controllers is something that our driving dynamics people did already for a long time, but they did it with suppliers,” Weber said. “Here, we had the knowledge, and we developed the algorithms with suppliers… We have to own this, because what we can do with this new controller, when we look at everything, is just incredible.”
As Weber noted, there’s been an increasing push to regionalize everything from emissions requirements to supplier sources around the world. Auto manufacturer supply chains are deeply integrated across borders, and globalization like that is very difficult and costly to unwind. Look at the incredible amount of damage that President Trump’s proposed 25 percent tariffs could have on US automakers alone, with dire estimates that US automakers could shut down within a week should they go into place. As Weber noted, regionalization which is used to put up boundaries between countries, is something that threatens the entire automotive industry. By bringing part of the production of what makes a BMW, a BMW, in-house, the company can, at least in some ways, minimize that risk. 
If the brief but thrilling experience I had in the VDX is any indicator, the new Heart of Joy, underlines BMW’s “Ultimate Driving Machine,” roots and promises a truly dynamic, all-electric driving future.

    After years of listening and talking, Alexa is about to start thinking.
  
Amazon is finally bringing generative AI to its Alexa voice assistant.
Amazon is expected to tease a major AI-powered upgrade for its voice assistant Alexa later this month, and it could change how we interact with the smart home tech. Amazon has sent out media invites for a Feb. 26 event in New York, where Amazon's Devices and Services team lead Panos Panay will be speaking.
Panay joined Amazon in 2023 after spending decades at Microsoft, where he helped shape the Surface product line.
The event is expected to preview Alexa's long-rumored generative AI voice capabilities, which could significantly enhance its ability to engage in more natural, contextual conversations and complete multistep tasks.
If announced, this would mark Alexa's most significant evolution since its debut in 2014. Although Amazon has long been a leader in the AI assistant space, the landscape is rapidly shifting. Companies like OpenAI, Google and Anthropic are rolling out increasingly sophisticated AI assistants capable of multitasking and completing complex requests.
Alexa currently processes one command at a time. Last month, OpenAI introduced a new AI agent called Operator, which aims to handle everyday tasks like making dinner reservations, ordering groceries and filling out forms. Amazon told CNET that the event will highlight the latest innovations from the Alexa team but did not provide further details.
With more than half a billion Alexa-enabled devices in homes worldwide, a generative AI upgrade could reshape how users interact with voice assistants, and potentially introduce a paid tier for more advanced capabilities. Reuters reported that Amazon has considered charging between $5 and $10 per month for the service, while keeping the original version of Alexa free.
Apple is also rumored to ramp up its smart home efforts with a Siri-powered, wall-mounted display designed to control household devices such as thermostats, lights and appliances.
Predicted to launch in March, the device is expected to be part of Apple's push to compete more aggressively in the smart home market, where it has historically trailed Google and Amazon."
7,2025-02-16,"It’s common problem when you’re building anything with screws: this one is too long, this one is too short. While she can’t teach you how to fix the latter, [Quinn Dunki] has made herself an absolutely deluxe screw shortening jig. And while that’s cool and all, the real value here is the journey; watching over [Quinn]’s shoulders while she’s in the machine shop is always illuminating.
First off, she starts with her old jig, which frankly makes us want one. It’s a short piece of aluminum angle stock with threaded holes in it. You thread the screw in as far as you want, and use the edge as a cutting guide. Very nice!
But aluminum threads wear out quickly so it works if you’re shortening dozens of screws, but gets wonky when you need to cut hundreds. The new jig is made out of steel, and has a slit that clamps the threads in place so she doesn’t have to hold the tiny screws with her other hand while sawing.
This video is, on the surface, about making an improved tool out of steel. But it’s the tips along the way that make it worth your watch. For instance “deburr early and often” is a recurring leitmotif here: it keeps the extra bits that form along any cut from messing up edge finding or vise registration. And yeah, she deburrs after every operation.
There are mistakes, and lessons learned along the way. We’re not going to spoil it all. But in the end, it’s a sweet tool that we’ve never seen before.
If you haven’t read [Quinn]’s series on machine tools that she wrote for us, it’s a treasure trove of machining wisdom.


Huh. Usually I just hold screws in the vise by the waste end when I’m cutting them to length.
With her jig, or common bolt shorteners, too, the fact that you have to unscrew the hacked bolt helps clean up the threads where the hacking happened.
She addresses this in the video though, and says it doesn’t clean up the threads enough for her liking. That being the case, I don’t see why a vise with a depth stop wouldn’t do the job just as well as her jig.
Put a nut on the screw close to the head before lopping off the end.
Removing the nut after shortening helps to clean the threads from the cut end.
She mentions this in the video.  Specifically something like “in the comments you are going to say ‘put a nut on the screw'”
And proceeds to explain why that’s … suboptimal
Honestly I just chuck the waste end in a drill and rotate it while I cut with a dremel or an angle grinder
why not just use the screw cutter in your wire strippers? #6, #8 and #10 cutters are common, and are almost always the size im using
https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.toolsid.com%2Fklein-tools%2Fitems%2F11055-10.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=cc6531ea348c3a976e09f10159060d36d39614f0ecb1ceb58f755c62ca00464b&ipo=images
Surely those are for copper and brass electrical screws and won’t hold up to steel and stainless
They do if: 1) you got a good quality pair of wire strippers 2) you use it to cut bolts with a grade of 8.8 and less (don’t know the equivalent in ex-world police units :D )
I have a good quality pair of wire strippers and I use the screw cutter for stainless steel screws all the time. Works perfectly up the 10-32. If I’m going to thread the screw into aluminum or plastic I do touch up the end of the screw with a file to make sure there aren’t any burrs.
I even bought a second pair of metric wire strippers specifically to cut metric screws.
She made this specifically for brass screws.
She addresses this in the video. Any means of shearing the threads off deforms them. Good enough to nip down an 8/32 or 6/32 for a cover plate, but if you’re doing hundreds of them at machinist precision tolerances it’s not good enough.
If you need to cut hundreds using machine tool precision  tolerance  i suggest buying a box full of the correct size
!!!!!  amen
i kept trying to understand the motivation for this and you put the nail on the head
Might be a different HaD project.
… put the screw in the hole…
A lot of the smaller sizes are not available in the shorter lengths a modelmaker might need. Once again, addressed in the video. Don’t think you can out-think her on the subject especially with something so obvious.

  Don’t think you can out-think her on the subject

Oh well… I didn’t realize that her solution was the definitive, end all and be all for every single situation. Do we all just bow down at once or do we line up and do it collectively 🙄
Ok Derek, If you’ve got a better design, let’s see it. Regardless, show some respect.

  Ok Derek, If you’ve got a better design, let’s see it. Regardless, show some respect.

My condescension wasn’t aimed at her. It was aimed at you. Your “there is no way that you , a commoner, can possibly out-think our queen” rhetoric is arrogant.
I think you have mixed up your bookmarks for hackaday.com and justbuyexactlywhatyouneed.com
JBEWYN.com is awesome. They have everything.
Except every damn thing seems to be out of stock.
Some people don’t have the desire, or time to waste making things when they can just be bought. The solution in the OP is fine for small volume jobs but suboptimal for anything of substantial volume. Buying is optimal though.
I have tried that many many times, it just flat out isn’t possible much of the time. To the point I generally don’t bother buying premade screws at all, for the small stuff – the turning and thread cutting keeps some practice on the lathe and doesn’t take that long, probably generates less waste too as those small diameter screws tend to be sold only in really quite long lengths.
Ewwwwww SAE screws 🤮
BlondiHacks and HaD overlapping seems about right. Didn’t know she wrote some articles for HaD and will read all of them with joy.
She is the best.
If you need to shorten hundreds of screws you could just buy a box of the correct length.
+1
Also explained in the video. They come as standard length and many/most model engineering projects need custom length.
Else if you have to make them it’s easier to make long ones then keep them around and trim to length as needed
If you’re cutting down hundreds of screws, you did your design work wrong.
You’re making the following assumptions, all  of which are incorrect.
1) All the fasteners this tool will modify will used in one project, when it actually looks like the perfect toolbox companion.
2) All projects have a neat Design – Make – Use flow. Rarely the case, especially for smaller projects.
3) The design work was perfect and nothing was discovered during the project requiring  changes. Never the case (for me, at least).
4) Fastener length is within the control of the maker. Rarely the case when modifying or restoring.
5) The time to order everything needed is available. Rarely the case.
6) The budget needed to order everything is available. I wish budget were never an issue, but I’m yet to do a project where it isn’t
This is addressed in the video, a full 90 seconds in. She’s building a scale live-steam locomotive which requires tiny screws of all different lengths, but those screws are only sold in size “long”.
I needed a 19mm machine screw when I had a 20mm. Drilled a hole in a wooden block, put the screw in, sawed off the excess mm with a hacksaw. Picked up the sliver that fell off. I can still see the burn mark on my finger two days later.
I have cut down hundreds of screws, bolts, even nuts, and then also scratch built hundreds of bolts ,screws, and nuts, all by hand, in lots of 1
to 16 max.
 The jig shown is awsome, but I need 6 for “all”  the sizes.
 the missing part, cutting a threaded fastener and leaveing just one start thread, is hard
so  I always just fix it with a file, which is, easy.
I supose if a person got right into it, a collet vice  and a v block set up would grab all the sizes, and would work for drilling pin holes, and other
holes in round stock, so might be worth the effort
hmmmmm, got a whole bunch of off cuts that would work for the leaves
Dremel with a cutting wheel.
That’s a bolt.  If you cut off a screw, you lose the tapered point, thereby creating a bolt.  Unless it’s the rake of the helical incline that makes a bolt and not the tapered point.  Hmm….
Yeah I was hoping for a self tapping/wood screw shortening guide but this is just for threaded bolts, should clarify the title with “machine screws” since just “screws” implies the more common wood or self tapping kind.
Again between material thickness choices and additional counter sunk depth you should never need to use anything but off the shelf bolt sizes if for no other reason than to be kind to the poor sod replacing a rusted bolt on your project 10 years later and finding out it isn’t 16mm but was 13.5mm and now the threads are all chewed out or they use 12mm and now it only has the tiniest engagement liable to pop off from a stiff breeze.
It’s a bolt if you use it with a nut. It’s a screw if it goes directly into the workpiece.
With all due respect, both of you are incorrect… It is a bolt if the tool that you use to adjust the fastener’s head is a wrench (gripping the exterior of the faster head. It is a screw if you use a screw driver to turn the fastener. The difference in as simple as a belly button. If it’s an “innie” then it’s a screw. If it’s an “outie” then it’s a bolt.
While I am at it, when you garbage up the threads on the fastener such that you cannot tighten it anymore, it is correct to say it is stripped. When the head is garbage such that you cannot turn it using your wrench or screw driver, the fastener is cammed. These conditions are usually avoidable with the correct discipline, but some people live where salt is used on the road. So don’t make a bolt too long, don’t make a fastener whose head is pointing toward the ground, or opposing the direction of travel. The reason is that water can properly drain in these configurations without trapping as much debris.
https://www.homedepot.com/p/Crown-Bolt-6-32-x-1-2-in-Phillips-Hex-Head-Machine-Screws-8-Pack-42681/203496357 What does that make a combo Phillips/hex head? A scolt? A brew?
ASME and Machinery’s both use the nut vs threaded workpiece definition. Is there a different standard out there (ISO? DIN?) that defines it based on the head type?
Klein strippers will last through at least five years of cutting number 6 and 8 screws every day without any need to refine thread. If you are in the unfortunate position of cutting 4-40 screws for a series of backplanes, I have an outstanding trick taught to me twenty years ago during my apprenticeship. Take a fine blade hacksaw. Turn it upside down, so the blade is up. Put the end of the hacksaw in a door strike plate to hold it steady, or in a mortar joint if the doors aren’t installed yet. Put the handle side in the notch of your hip. Lightly draw the bolt back and forth across the blade, letting just the weight of your hands push the bolt against the blade. This cuts an incredibly smooth cut, no filing needed even with 40 threads per inch, and cuts even 10mm thick bolts far quicker than you would think. Beats walking down to the van for a vise and a bandsaw
Having watched the video, I’m not claiming my method is better than what Quinn is doing, but not having a full machine shop available, I do what I can.
I put two nuts onto the bolt I want to shorten, and lock them together at the spot that I want to make the cut. I then put the waste end into a drill, such that there is a small gap between the chuck and the nut, where I will make the cut. I then run the drill, and place the hacksaw blade against the nut and press gently against the bolt, such that the turning drill is doing most of the work. I do also move the blade back and forwards to prevent uneven wear on the saw blade.
As mentioned by others, removing the nuts does help to straighten the burr (not “clean up the thread”, as Quinn points out), and a gentle filing can finish the job if needed.
She has created the right tool for the job. She’s creating a locomotive and all the bolts are in size miniature. What she’s doing doesn’t apply to the “huge” M6 bolts. This is all tiny stuff. I’ve been following this project from the start and she’s showing off all her mistakes, which I like as you can learn from that. I’m making motorcycle headers and I’ve made so many mistakes on that tiny project. It’s especially difficult considering I’m not buying new tubes but cut up old tubes I had laying around. It’s something that helps you learn. Same with her projects. It’s great to see how she fails upwards and ends up with something amazing. I’m really jelous of her die filer. That’s a machine that’s on my dream list, but I don’t have the tools to build one and buying it isn’t really possible as everything comes in casting kits that you have to machine.
This is a pretty nice tool, but a lot of machining for little gain (except YouTube views). Why not just use a normal strip of metal? Instead of all this belt business just drill two holes and put some dowels in.
As someone that mostly make things with M2, M2.5, M3 and M4, and the occasional M1.6 and finer, yeah, it’s always annoying to shorten screws, and I have a very good selection in length, screw heads, material and colours and try to design around that, but sometimes you need the odd size that isn’t easily available. Just like she quickly mentions there are negatives with any method you choose (and shears are the worst due to deformation), and I prefer files and dremel cut-off.
That looks like a fine tool, and I get the feeling she will wish she had made that years ago.
Both deburring & chamfering of cut of thread goes very well with a belt grinder.  Make sure to grind the burrs radially towards the center of the screw (I.e., away from the thread). This ensures any remaining burrs are harmless.
But not everybody has a belt grinder. You can also put an angle grinder with a flap disc in a vise or some other kind of holder to make it stationary. Both belt grinders and flap discs are somewhere in between grinding and polishing. As a result these create much fewer burrs then a grinding stone.

8,2025-02-16,"Imposing US tariffs on UK steel would be ""negative"" for both countries, the business secretary has said.
Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK and US have a ""mutual interest"" in negotiating an exemption from President Donald Trump's plans for the 25% import tax, which could come into force in March.
He said the UK was in a different trading position to other countries and could offer ""very specialised"" steel and aluminium exports the US needs like Navy submarine casings made in Sheffield, while tariffs would push up costs for US taxpayers.
Reynolds' comments came after the government promised up to £2.5bn in support for the UK steel industry.
President Trump has said his tariffs would be enforced ""without exceptions or exemptions"".
However, Reynolds told the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that imposing them on UK steel ""would be negative for ourselves, it would be negative for the US as well"".
He said he has had ""some very constructive conversations with key people in the Trump administration recognising our relationship is different"", including the US special envoy to the UK.
The minister told the programme he thought there was a basis for ""constructive engagement"" between the UK and US but ""I'm not saying it's easy"".
He added: ""I appreciate they have a mandate for changing how they approach the issues of trade, but we have got a different argument, a different story to tell, to the EU or to China in relation to our trading relationships.""
The government has already said it would not retaliate immediately to the tariffs announced by Trump.
UK Steel, which represents the industry, has said the tariffs would be a ""devastating blow"" that would damage the sector's £400m-a-year contribution to UK-US trade.
The UK is not a big supplier of steel to the US, with the country accounting for about 10% of British steel exports. 
But there are concerns within the industry the tariffs might not just hinder exports to the US, but also lead to excess steel being ""dumped"" in the UK.
This could occur if other countries no longer exporting to the US decide to offload steel at cheaper prices, which could potentially lead to UK steelmaking businesses being undercut.
Shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith said the ""uncertainty"" the steel industry faced due to US tariffs was something the government ""has been entirely silent on when instead they should be talking to the US, our closest trading partner"".
On Sunday, the government launched a consultation on its Plan for Steel, which will look at ways to reverse long-term issues facing the industry - including cheap imports flooding the domestic market.
The UK steel industry has faced heavy job losses in recent years.
Tata Steel is replacing old blast furnaces with an electric arc furnace - which is less energy-intensive and environmentally friendlier - at its site in Port Talbot, Wales. Traditional steelmaking at the site ceased in September, resulting in 2,800 job cuts.
British Steel announced in 2023 it would close blast furnaces in Scunthorpe, and unveiled plans to roll out an electric arc furnace, which requires fewer workers to keep it going, with 2,000 jobs under threat.
Asked about the potential job losses in Scunthorpe, Reynolds accepted that there would be a ""reduction in head count"" with the introduction of new technologies, but he said more jobs could be created if demand for UK steel was increased.
The government's plan will address issues that have been ""holding the industry back for too long"", the Department for Business and Trade (DBT) said, including:
The consultation will also examine electricity costs for steel companies ""to make the UK competitive globally"", but the government has not yet made a firm commitment to reduce energy bills.
Griffiths said he looked forward to seeing a detailed plan, but added ""a clear part must be steps to reduce the cost of energy which is placing an intolerable strain on UK steel"".
Help for the sector will be available through the National Wealth Fund, which partners the government with the private sector and local authorities to finance infrastructure and other projects. 
The government says this financial assistance could benefit Scotland, as well as areas of England such as Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, Rotherham and Redcar which have ""a strong history of steel production"".
But the DBT said it was ""wasting no time"" supporting UK steel, pointing to the government's backing an expansion of Heathrow Airport, which it said would require 400,000 tonnes of steel.
The GMB union said the government's plan to support the ""beleaguered"" steel industry provided ""desperately needed"" funding after ""years of dithering"". 
""As the world becomes more volatile, primary domestic steel making capacity is vital for both our economy and domestic security,"" the union's national secretary Andy Prendergast added.
Gareth Stace, director-general of UK Steel, said the government's commitment to the industry was ""both vital and welcome"".
Information gathered in the consultation will be used to help form a ""steel strategy"", to be launched in the spring.
Stace added a robust strategy ""has the power to reverse the sector's decline, particularly as we face increasing competition from imports benefiting from more favourable business conditions"".
The Liberal Democrats have said the government urgently needs to prepare for retaliatory tariff. Deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the UK steel industry was being left ""dangerously exposed"" to the ""devastating damage"" Trump's tariffs could inflict.
Trump wants US vehicles to be more popular in Europe, but it's a difficult market for them to crack.
The surprise inclusion of VAT to calculate tariffs prompts questions over the possible impact on British businesses.
He wants to hit back at countries that place import taxes on American goods that he thinks are too high.
Modi and Trump rekindle ties amid a global trade war, balancing tariffs, trade deals and strategic interests.
Trump and Modi, who share warm personal ties, met in the shadow of trade tensions complicating US-India relations.

What this means: On a weekly basis, Realtor.com reports the year-over-year change in active inventory and new listings.  On a monthly basis, they report total inventory.  For January, Realtor.com reported inventory was up 24.6% YoY, but still down 24.8% compared to the 2017 to 2019 same month levels.  Now - on a weekly basis - inventory is up 27.5% YoY.

Realtor.com has monthly and weekly data on the existing home market. Here is their weekly report: Weekly Housing Trends View—Data for Week Ending Feb. 8, 2025• Active inventory increased, with for-sale homes 27.5% above year-ago levels

For the 66th consecutive week, the number of homes for sale has increased compared with the same time last year. This week also marked the fifth straight week where the growth rate has increased, fueled by the entrance of many new listings on the market. 
  
• New listings–a measure of sellers putting homes up for sale–increased 11.3%

Fresh inventory increased year over year for the fifth week in a row, as sellers trickled back into the market. We project home sales to increase in 2025 compared with 2024, which notched the lowest existing-home sales since 1996. Here is a graph of the year-over-year change in inventory according to realtor.com. 
Inventory was up year-over-year for the 66th consecutive week.  New listings have jumped recently but remain below typical pre-pandemic levels.

For investors planning their trades, a heads-up: U.S. stock markets will be closed on Monday, February 17, 2025, in observance of Presidents’ Day. 
With that in mind, let’s take a look at what the week has in store for investors.
This week will be relatively quiet on the earnings front, as no major companies are scheduled to release their financial results — except for a few key players that could still drive market movements.
Thursday will be the highlight of the week for earnings watchers. Retail giant Walmart (WMT-0.96%) and Chinese e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba (BABA+4.34%) are both set to report their quarterly results in the morning, offering insights into consumer spending trends in the U.S. and China.
Later in the day, Block Inc. (SQ+0.67%) (XYZ-0.34%) — the fintech company led by Jack Dorsey — will release its earnings report after the market closes.
The week kicks off on Tuesday with the release of the Home Builder Confidence Index, which will provide insights into how optimistic U.S. homebuilders are about the housing market.
On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will publish the minutes from its January FOMC meeting, giving investors a closer look at policymakers’ discussions on inflation, interest rates, and the overall economic outlook. 
Thursday brings the release of the weekly initial jobless claims report, offering fresh data on the strength of the labor market and unemployment trends.
Finally, on Friday, the Consumer Sentiment (final) report will shed light on how confident consumers feel about the economy, while the Existing Home Sales report will provide a snapshot of demand in the housing market.

What if the ""cost"" is that you can only post once per 10 minutes?

The cost doesn't have to be monetary. It could just delay posting for a few seconds, to stop people mindlessly clicking that repost button on every bit of misinformation they see.

""The only winning move is not to play.""
> It smells of putting free speech at a premium
No, where did you get that idea from?
Transactional costs mean to delay anyone’s posting, so that things like the Southport riots can’t happen because of some maniac racists tweet.  It's not about money, but delays, barriers.
We had perfectly functional free speech in the days when it would require you to mail your response to the editor.  Just because the editor might not publish, doesn’t affect free speech as that is not what free speech is.
Free speech is NOT the ability to post unregulated, unchecked content maliciously intended to trigger a riot and break law.  Free speech is the freedom to not be persecuted by the state for speaking out against the state.  Basically you can disagree with your government and well, nuts to them if they don’t like it.
But in almost all countries that have free speech, we have all agreed to not have absolute free speech so there are things you can say that will land you in trouble.  We all agreed to have such limits.  It's the same with say, driving?  I am free to drive my car practically anywhere, except for a few places.  I'm also not free to drive too fast... and I'm not free to run over people who are in my way, or to drive at someone I don’t like to shock them, which would make the car into a weapon.
But I'm free to drive my car!
The system we have at this time may allow the instant dissemination of thoughts and feelings with no delays, and that may feel like the ultimate in ""free speech"" but it isn’t.  It's just a means to disseminate crap quickly.  Besides, free speech doesn’t really apply with private systems in the same way it doesn’t apply to writing letters to a newspaper.  Free speech is about the government, the state, and how THEY deal with you.
It smells of putting free speech at a premium. I.e. the more money you have, the more you can free speechThis is literally what we already have in multiple ways in the US.

Censorship is the problem. Internet can reroute around failures but humans rarely try twice. When someone is banned they just disappear. When you combine this with infinite scroll and no organization layouts like twitter, they're effectively removed from your memory. Text messages that go undelivered because of algorithmic classification look ignored. Your friend on Facebook doesn't show up on your feed but celebrities do.

Exactly.  After Twitter censored this guy [x.com], we've never heard from him again.
You mean, we never heard from him after he posted his whine earlier today? He wasn't able to later post [x.com] that he fell for a scam?
Curious what the motive of the sender of that email is.
That's you being an asshole and people showing you the door. 

You're complaint isn't that you're being censored. You can easily set up a free website damn near anywhere and say damn near anything except for Neo-Nazi shit (you need a lot of money if you want to be a Neo-Nazi on the internet and get away with it). 

No it's not about censorship, you've got plenty of ways to get your voice out. What people who bitch about censorship are upset about is they don't have access to an audience for free anymore. You can't just pop in and be a complete asshole and not get banned.I've long said that too many people confuse freedom of expression (not just speech, if you want to put your message out in written word or interpretive dance, go for it) with immunity from criticism. What most of the people complaining that they've ""been cancelled"" or claiming ""you can't say anything any more"" are really trying to claim is immunity from criticism. They idea that they get to say whatever they want and the rest of us must sit here and silently agree with them. That isn't freedom of expression

Disagree.
While there is something to be said about the preponderance of evidence, you cannot in the same breath point out the rise of fringe conspiracy theories while also point to majority opinion holding sway.
Prior to social media we had mass media, whispering campaigns, and gossip galore. Same problems and eventually people get wise to who is lying to them and excise them from their attention, especially with mass repetition (see cable tv).
Truth of the matter is the quality of discourse has plummeted (especially from the early days of the web) with attention whores to monetary gains and censorship and gamification. The signal to noise ratio isn't worth the effort, so even more people with wise observations check-out and leave the banal to dominate the discussion.
""Social media"" is just a boogeyman, much like comic books, pinball, and telephones before. The problem isn't so much as described (Mcluhan would have something to say about that), but the gatekeepers tut-tutting the unvarnished public and the commercialization of the web.
Which early days are of the net are you talking about?  Which good old days are these?
I was there for Usenet.    There was just as much trash and idiocy and knuckleheads taking over groups and other bullshit as now.
My favorite was a bunch of pro wrestling fans who took over some random nearly dead group, stomping through it like digital ancient Vikings marauding the British coast.  There was much crying and calls for control and blah blah blah which went nowhere as no one controlled Usenet.
There was never a 
The irony of pointing out the quality; to have someone conflate it with quantity.
And then omitting the evolution of the web to conflate it with people have changed (which they have, or has your entire thought process ossified?).
Yeah.

Exactly, or to fire the nukes themselves!
The answer is no, like it always is when the question is in the headline.
It is not technology, it is people. Communication is a tool, it is what is being communicated that is the problem.  The problem is the SuperKendalling, the gamification of literarily everything for personal amusement and advantage.  Constant lying is what ""tears us apart"".
Constant lying is what ""tears us apart"".One person's conjecture would be another person's lie, simply because it can't be proven, even if they can't disprove it. The problem with that is, even conjecture is useful. Science and mathematics wouldn't even work without it.

Presenting conjecture as the truth is simply lying -- that is likely to offer negative value.  Presenting conjecture as an idea that might worthy of further investigation -- that has a significant chance of bringing positive value.

 "" ... What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains"" Probably the same thing, endless 'reality' (to use the common euphemism) Tv. does, that endless pornography does.  The difference is (to borrow from AR Moxon), the US has a hate group run by billionaires, disguised as a major political party.  That makes avoiding the endless propaganda, almost impossible.  It's not surprising so many people voted for the party of hate.  It's surprising so many people stopped joining the half-arsed protest against that hate.

It takes decades to end the propaganda and addiction, to change people's mind-set and emotions.  The US can't wait for nice things to happen, so taking control means admitting the alternatives are ugly and violent:  To be precise, it requires someone to make those ugly decisions.  The people protesting against MAGA, don't have that.

Hey, kudos on raising your kid to be a critical thinker.
Personally, I think rsilvergun made the mistake of speaking in absolutes (saying things like ""Nobody wants their kid..."" and ""no parent is going to..."" etc.).  Clearly, that is untrue, there are parents (like you) who teach their kids to think critically and are unafraid of having their own ideas challenged by doing so.
However, it seems like many parents are in the category that rsilvergun describes (whether they realize it or not).  Even if it is not

You are this master manipulator genius who can convince me to vote however you like because you think I'm defensive about... something.
You're a riot.  Are you someone's AI experiment?  I know there's that AC who always posts about your menstrual cup and being in Singapore and all that but that could be a head fake from your programmers.  Kudos to whoever coded you.
I did too, but I don't think things were better then. The ""good old days"" aren't actually as good as we remember them. We were just more sheltered by the viewpoints of our parents, who simply didn't tell us about other points of view.

Same here.  I saw the internet come into my hoe and boy was it fund being amongst the development of PC's during the 90's.
As a full ""in it deep"" computer geek I loved everything about it, got my CS degree and so on.  Set me up for life, got me a house.
Yet my foundation, nearly the first half of my current years alive, is based on slower and more meaningful methods, like newspapers, books, letters.  It took time to look up information, but

IMPHO... It's entitled people who already had a platform discovering that amplifying themselves no longer drowns out the voices of the poor.
Me, I call it a gutenberg cycle. The point at which, in society, the barrier to remote communication and the time required for it are lowered enough that the average person has a personal capability comparable to what a wealthy person has by default.
It took ~200 years for the Catholic Church to realise that it was no longer in control of peoples' beliefs, that they didn't have the ability to dictate how the average person saw the world in the face of them being able to reassert their experiences to each other. I wonder how long it will take the authoritarians now.
This is beautiful; I'm glad I scrolled down.
I've always really loved two things about the internet:1. The low barrier for ordinary people to distribute their thoughts to a wide audience.  It goes a long way toward fixing the problem exemplified by the quote, ""The freedom of the press is reserved for those who happen to own one.""2. The wider range of content choices compared to television or radio and the ability to block ads.
Algorithmically determined content streams—such as those of most social media 
The problem with social media and the like are the algorithms designed for the highest engagement.  Then instead of seeing my friends' photos, I mainly see weird AI shit and random videos trying to grab my attention.  Apparently Aliexpress teams up with Facebook, because now I see a bunch of random woodworking shit since I bought some router bits from China.
Of course if I clicked on or searched for political content there, then I'd see more and more political content that I engage with.  Pretty soon, I'm a 
You have an option.  Stop using Facebook.  Why are you there at all?  I had to create a bunch of fb accounts for work but only logged in for testing etc.  Since that job died I've found 1-2 legitimate reasons per -year- to login.  It's a huge void of nothing and wasted bits.  Stop logging in.
Conservatives and liberals have existed, and fought with each other, since at least the Roman Empire. With today's ease of communication, we're just better able to self-organize with other like-minded people, even if they aren't located near us.
> we're just better able to self-organize with other like-minded people, even if they aren't located near us.
Thats exactly the problem. Thast what this is all about helping to minimise.
Exactly.
Thats one of the solutions, although I'd say a few hours is more than enough.
Using commercial services that rely on noisemaking and provocation to gain attention and ad-money is a part of that problem, but also basic etiquette and manners. Don't offend easily and don't be easily offended is one rules from back in the days of usenet and fidonet that people these days would benefit from observing.

We had a bit of separation because we were taught to never give our real name and age, yet we created a handle that most people used on multiple sites that would have a reputation that could follow it. I think that's mostly lost when a lot of ""normies"" went online.

It's like everything I've been thinking about this very subject has been written down and published.
I mean almost thought for thought this man wrote the same ideas I've been thinking about since around 2010 and a bit earlier.
I grew up in the 90's, that means I was a teen in 1995, 14/15 to be exact.  I know how I used to live and connect to the world as an 80's kid and a 90's teen.  I saw the internet enter my home, as well as the PC.  I lived through that transition, saw magazines disappear and get replaced 
I'd disagree with the reason being ""neither obvious nor simple"". The fact that social media allows you to curate your own echo chamber is a pretty big reason that this. Social skills are like any skill; if you don't exercise it you don't develop it... and dealing with people you disagree with is a skill.
This fact, plus the general time and character limits on replies, means everything controversial is an ""either / or"" issue even if the common opinion isn't as black and white.

As we have seen in past postings, both the S&P and the NASDAQ have been tracking the upward movement in their respective monthly cycles. The S&P target is in the 6200-6300 area.
The NASDAQ Composite will likely rally to 20500. The below-surface correction in the market has been concentrated in the big-cap technology stocks. These equities have a strong effect on the indices and have pulled the market down in an erratic trading range since December. Actually, most stocks in the NASDAQ have been rising. More effort is required to find stocks to buy with the market near all-time highs. Here are a pair of equities that are in a reasonably attractive position.
V.F. Corporation engages in the design, procurement, marketing, and distribution of branded lifestyle apparel, footwear, and accessories for men, women, and children. The stock was detected by a Cycles Research screen. The monthly strip in the three-up chart below is revealing. The stock topped in 2020, but the downtrend has been reversing to the upside. The relative strength has turned up and has been rising for more than six months. This is the minimum precondition that an investor should accept. The series of rising momentum lows in the weekly strip are bullish. The monthly histogram is favorable. In fact, the share price has risen 84% of the time from January 27th to April 5th over the last 44 years. The stock may advance to the $40-$45 range by yearend.
Chart 1: VF Daily, Weekly, Monthly
VFC is showing longer-term buy signals. 
Chart 2: VF Monthly Histogram
This is a bullish interval for this stock.
Atlassian Corporation designs, develops, licenses, and maintains various software products globally. The stock is in an uptrend but can still be bought. As can be seen in the weekly and the monthly strips, the stock formed a base from late 2022. Relative price has broken downtrend lines. It is not too late to buy because the monthly momentum shows a series of higher lows and is one of the few NASDAQ technology stocks that is not overbought.
The monthly cycle points to wide swings in the share price but a higher close at yearend. The stock is likely to be in the 360-400 area by June.
Chart 3: Atlassian- Daily, Weekly, Monthly
This is a bullish picture.

14,2025-02-16,"Hollywood stars are in London for the Bafta Film Awards, as an unpredictable awards season finally begins to take shape.
Pope selection drama Conclave leads the Bafta field with 12 nominations, including best film and best actor for its British star Ralph Fiennes. 
Spanish-language musical Emilia Pérez has 11 nominations, but recently saw its awards chances damaged after offensive historic tweets from its star resurfaced.
The ceremony, hosted by David Tennant at London's Royal Festival Hall, will be broadcast on BBC One from 19:00 GMT.
For months, there has been no consensus on what will ultimately win best picture at the Oscars on 2 March, with as many as six films having a possible path to victory.
The race narrowed last week, however, when Cannes Film Festival winner Anora,  about a New York stripper who falls for the son of a wealthy Russian, leapt ahead after a string of precursor wins.
The film took the top prizes at the Critics Choice Awards (CCA) as well as two major guild ceremonies considered key Oscars indicators - the Directors Guild of America (DGA) and Producers Guild of America (PGA) Awards.
It strengthened its frontrunner status on Saturday, winning the original screenplay prize at the Writers Guild of America (WGA) Awards. 
The winners at the Baftas could be the strongest indication yet of who will triumph at the Oscars. Last year, the winners of the top six categories matched up perfectly between the two ceremonies.
The films with the most Bafta nominations:

How to watch the Bafta and Oscar-nominated films
The Bafta Film Awards ceremony starts at 17:00 GMT, two hours before its broadcast begins on BBC One, which means winners will be reported in the news and on social media before being seen on television.
One major difference this year is that the nominating juries which were introduced after a diversity scandal in 2020 have been phased out of most categories, which means the nominees have been entirely determined by Bafta members.
During the ceremony, Take That will perform their 2008 single Greatest Day, which features prominently in Anora.
Elsewhere, Wicked star Jeff Goldblum will play the piano during the In Memoriam section, which pays tribute to the film industry figures who have died in the last year.
Pamela Anderson, Anna Kendrick, Camila Cabello, Joe Alwyn, Celia Imrie, James Norton, Selena Gomez, Jesse Eisenberg, Naomi Ackie and Tom Felton are among the stars who will present prizes during the ceremony.
Actor and TV presenter Warwick Davis will be awarded the Bafta Fellowship, the highest honour bestowed by the British Academy.
The current acting frontrunners in the Oscars race are Demi Moore (The Substance), Adrien Brody (The Brutalist), Zoe Saldaña (Emilia Pérez) and Kieran Culkin (A Real Pain). 
It's possible all four could also triumph in their respective categories at the Baftas -  but their wins here are far from guaranteed.
Although the Baftas are usually an Oscars bellwether, the British Academy also occasionally goes its own way, and takes the opportunity to reward a home-grown star on their own soil.
For example, Rachel Weisz, Kerry Condon, Barry Keoghan and Joanna Scanlan are among the Irish and British actors who have won at Bafta in recent years and not gone on to win the Oscar (Scanlan was not nominated).
This year, British star Marianne Jean-Baptiste (Hard Truths) is a strong contender for the best leading actress Bafta despite not making it into the same category at the Academy Awards. She would be the first black Bafta winner of best actress. 
Other British and Irish acting nominees this year include Ralph Fiennes (Conclave), Felicity Jones (The Brutalist), Hugh Grant (Heretic), Cynthia Erivo (Wicked) and Saoirse Ronan (The Outrun). 
Meanwhile, Selena Gomez (Emilia Pérez), Ariana Grande (Wicked), Sebastian Stan (The Apprentice), Timothée Chalamet and Edward Norton (both for A Complete Unknown) are among the other Hollywood stars in the race.
By now, you're probably familiar with the main films in the acting and best picture races, following their success at other film awards events such as the Golden Globes.
But just in case you're joining us for the first time and keen to catch up on the major movies, here's a quick cheat sheet with each contender's plot summarised in one sentence:
Most of the major categories at the Baftas are the same as other awards events, but the British Academy has additional awards specifically intended to recognise British talent.
That means there are some film nominated for Baftas which are not in the Oscars race, particularly in the outstanding British film category.
They include the superb Bird, about a young girl growing up on a tough housing estate, and Mike Leigh's terrific Hard Truths, about a woman whose depression puts severe strain on those around her.
Other nominees in the category include Lee, about war photojournalist Lee Miller, Kneecap, about a hip-hop group who rap in the Irish language, and the excellent Love Lies Bleeding, about a gym manager who falls for a driven but dangerous bodybuilder.
World War Two drama Blitz, which follows a young boy who makes his way back to London after the city is evacuated, is also nominated, alongside The Outrun, about a young recovering alcoholic who returns to Orkney. 
The category is rounded out by Oscars contender Conclave, box office hit Gladiator II, and animated favourite Wallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl.
Meanwhile, the Bafta nominees for outstanding debut by a British writer, director or producer are Hoard, Kneecap, Monkey Man, Santosh and Sister Midnight.
There is a brand new category this year too - best children's and family film - which sees Wallace and Gromit nominated alongside Flow, Kensuke's Kingdom and The Wild Robot.

15,2025-02-16,"NORFOLK, Va. — Like the other Founding Fathers, George Washington was uneasy about the idea of publicly celebrating his life. He was the first leader of a new republic, not a king.
And yet the United States will once again commemorate its first president on Monday, 293 years after he was born.
The meaning of Presidents Day has changed dramatically, from being mostly unremarkable and filled with work for Washington in the 1700s to the bonanza of consumerism it has become today. For some historians, the holiday has lost all discernible meaning.
Historian Alexis Coe, author of “You Never Forget Your First: A Biography of George Washington,” has said she thinks about Presidents Day in much the same way as the towering monument in D.C. bearing his name.
“It’s supposed to be about Washington, but can you really point to anything that looks or sounds like him?” she remarked in an interview with The Associated Press in 2024. “Jefferson and Lincoln are presented as people with limbs and noses and words associated with their memorials. And he’s just a giant, granite point. He has been sanded down to have absolutely no identifiable features.”
Here is a look at how things have evolved:
Washington was born Feb. 22, 1732, on Popes Creek Plantation near the Potomac River in Virginia.
Technically, though, he was born Feb. 11 under the ancient Julian calendar, which was still in use for the first 20 years of his life. The Gregorian calendar, intended to more accurately mark the solar year, was adopted in 1752, adding 11 days.
Either way, Washington paid little attention to his birthday, according to Mountvernon.org, the website of the organization that manages his estate. Surviving records make no mention of observances at Mount Vernon, while his diary shows he was often hard at work.
“If he had it his way, he would be at home with his family,” Coe said. “Maybe some beloved nieces and nephews (and friend) Marquis de Lafayette would be ideal. And Martha’s recipe for an indulgent cake. But that’s about it.”
Washington’s birthday was celebrated by his peers in government when he was president, mostly.
Congress voted during his first two terms to take a short commemorative break each year, with one exception, his last birthday in office, Coe said. By then, Washington was less popular, partisanship was rampant and many members of his original Cabinet were gone, including Thomas Jefferson.
“One way to show their disdain for his Federalist policies was to keep working through his birthday,” Coe said.
The Library of Congress does note a French military officer, the comte de Rochambeau, threw a ball celebrating Washington’s 50th birthday in 1782.

Washington was very aware of his inaugural role as president and its distinction from the British crown. He didn’t want to be honored like a king, Seth Bruggeman, a history professor at Temple University in Philadelphia, told the AP last year.
Still, he said, a market for Washington memorabilia sprang up almost immediately after his death in 1799 at age 67, with people snapping up pottery and reproductions of etchings portraying him as a divine figure going off into heaven.
“Even in that early moment, Americans kind of conflated consumerism with patriotic memory,” said Bruggeman, whose books include “Here, George Washington Was Born: Memory, Material Culture, and the Public History of a National Monument.”
It wasn’t until 1832, the centennial of his birth, that Congress established a committee to arrange national “parades, orations and festivals,” according to the Congressional Research Service.
Only in 1879 was his birthday formally made into a legal holiday for federal employees in the District of Columbia.
The official designation for the holiday is Washington’s Birthday, although it has come to be known informally as Presidents Day. Arguments have been made to honor President Lincoln as well because his birth date falls nearby, on Feb. 12.
A small number of states, including Illinois, observe Lincoln’s birthday as a public holiday, according to the Library of Congress. And some commemorate both Lincoln and Washington on Presidents Day.
But on the federal level, the day is still officially Washington’s Birthday.
By the late 1960s, Washington’s Birthday was one of nine federal holidays that fell on specific dates on different days of the week, according to a 2004 article in the National Archives’ Prologue magazine.
Congress voted to move some of those to Mondays, following concerns that were in part about absenteeism among government workers when a holiday fell midweek. But lawmakers also noted clear benefits to the economy, including boosts in retail sales and travel on three-day weekends.
The Uniform Monday Holiday Act took effect in 1971, moving Presidents Day to the third Monday in February. Sales campaigns soared, historian C. L. Arbelbide wrote in Prologue.
Bruggeman said Washington and the other Founding Fathers “would have been deeply worried” by how the holiday became taken over by commercial and private interests.
“They were very nervous about corporations,” Bruggeman said. “It wasn’t that they forbade them. But they saw corporations as like little republics that potentially threatened the power of The Republic.”
Coe, who is also a fellow at the Washington think tank New America, said by now the day is devoid of recognizable traditions.
“There’s no moment of reflection,” Coe said. Given today’s widespread cynicism toward the office, she added, that sort of reflection “would probably be a good idea.”

The journey of industrial design is often a race against time, where creativity meets the constraints of deadlines. In this fast-moving landscape, the ability to render high-quality visuals quickly is a game-changer. KeyShot has emerged as an industry leader by revolutionizing how designers visualize their ideas. From its origins as a simple real-time rendering tool to becoming a cornerstone of the Product Design-to-Market ecosystem, KeyShot has continuously evolved to meet the demands of modern design workflows.
Designers don’t just need a tool—they need a system that accelerates their process without sacrificing quality. KeyShot has become that system by offering intuitive, real-time ray tracing, seamless integration with 3D modeling software, and a streamlined pipeline that connects the creative and commercial aspects of product development. With its latest positioning as the ultimate Product Design-to-Market Suite, KeyShot is shaping the future of industrial design by closing the gap between concept and consumer-ready visuals.

KeyShot Studio was created with a clear mission: to make photorealistic rendering accessible, intuitive, and fast. Traditional rendering tools often required extensive setup and long rendering times, but KeyShot Studio disrupted that model with its real-time ray tracing engine. Designers could now see the impact of material, lighting, and camera adjustments instantly—a crucial advantage in industries where iteration speed is key.
Over the years, the company has expanded its capabilities by embracing GPU acceleration, denoising, and cloud rendering, ensuring that designers always have cutting-edge tools at their disposal. A major milestone in its journey has been its repositioning within the broader Product Design-to-Market strategy, a vision that emphasizes not just rendering, but the entire lifecycle of a product’s visual development. This shift aligns with KeyShot’s mission to eliminate inefficiencies, bridge the gap between design and marketing, and deliver high-impact visuals effortlessly.

One of the standout reasons for KeyShot’s dominance is its ability to deliver stunning photorealistic results with minimal effort. Whether it’s the soft glow of ambient lighting on a luxury watch or the intricate texture of a high-performance sneaker, KeyShot renders materials with unparalleled accuracy. Its scientifically accurate material library ensures that reflections, refractions, and light interactions behave exactly as they would in the real world.
Ease of use is another defining factor. Many professional rendering tools demand extensive technical knowledge, but KeyShot’s drag-and-drop simplicity makes it accessible to both seasoned professionals and newcomers. Designers can import models from virtually any 3D CAD software, apply materials instantly, and see the results in real-time—without the steep learning curve often associated with high-end rendering tools.

In an industry where time is often the most valuable resource, KeyShot Studio’s ability to produce high-quality renders quickly is a defining advantage. Traditional rendering engines require hours—sometimes days—to generate complex visuals, but KeyShot Studio’s real-time rendering engine accelerates this process without compromising detail.
A study on rendering speed found that 88% of designers prefer KeyShot over competitors due to its ability to deliver top-tier results faster than traditional rendering workflows. This speed advantage isn’t just about cutting down on waiting time—it transforms the creative process by allowing designers to iterate more freely and explore multiple design variations without the frustration of long render times.

KeyShot’s role in the design process has grown significantly, and its recent shift into the Product Design-to-Market space is a strategic move to streamline workflows beyond just rendering. The inefficiencies in product visualization—often caused by fragmented processes, data silos, and disconnected teams—cost businesses both time and money. KeyShot is addressing this challenge by integrating into broader digital asset pipelines, ensuring that design, marketing, and manufacturing teams stay aligned from concept to final product.
Through cloud-powered rendering solutions like AWS Deadline Cloud, designers can now scale their workflows effortlessly, handling complex scenes without being limited by local hardware. This means even large enterprises with extensive product lines can accelerate their go-to-market strategies without bottlenecks.
Image Credits: Jenga Design
The industrial design community has embraced KeyShot Studio not just as a rendering tool but as an integral part of their design-to-market strategy. Companies like Kumatech and Jenga Design have leveraged KeyShot’s capabilities to enhance their workflow efficiency and product visualization.
Kumatech, a leader in AGV (Automated Guided Vehicles) development, credits KeyShot Studiofor transforming their design process, enabling them to visualize complex engineering designs with photorealistic clarity. With KeyShot, they can communicate intricate technical details effectively to stakeholders, reducing design misinterpretations and speeding up approvals.
Similarly, Jenga Design, a UK-based design consultancy, has used KeyShot Studio to bring its creative concepts to life with remarkable realism. By integrating KeyShot into their workflow, the team has enhanced their ability to present design concepts to clients, leading to faster decision-making and improved project outcomes.

While KeyShot continues to lead in rendering speed and quality, it operates in a competitive space alongside tools like Blender, V-Ray, and Unreal Engine. Each tool has its strengths—Blender offers open-source flexibility, V-Ray excels in architectural visualization, and Unreal Engine provides real-time interactivity. However, KeyShot’s focus on industrial and product design gives it a unique edge.
Its ability to integrate seamlessly with CAD software, deliver unparalleled material accuracy, and streamline the rendering workflow without requiring deep technical expertise positions it as the preferred choice for designers looking for efficiency without compromise.

KeyShot’s trajectory suggests an exciting future as it continues to evolve with emerging technologies. With an eye on automation, AR/VR integration, and expanded cloud capabilities, the platform is set to further pioneer the rendering landscape.
One of the upcoming priorities is to leverage AI to automate material application and lighting setups, reducing manual effort and making the rendering process even more intuitive. Additionally, Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) capabilities will enable designers to interact with their models in immersive environments, opening new possibilities for product visualization and client collaboration.
As the demand for high-quality, rapid rendering grows, KeyShot Studio remains at the forefront, adapting to industry needs while maintaining its core principles of speed, quality, and ease of use.

                    Trouble continues for popular torrent site TorrentGalaxy. The site, which is seen as a notorious piracy market by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, has been unreachable for days. While some believe that the end has come for the site, technical troubles certainly can't be ruled out.
        




Founded in 2018, TorrentGalaxy has grown to become a leading player in the torrent ecosystem.
However, the past few months have been far from smooth sailing and last Thursday, TorrentGalaxy become entirely unreachable once again. 
Attempts to access the popular torrent site stopped short of their intended destination. With one exception (torrentgalaxy.mx which points to 127.0.0.1) the site’s domain names are working just fine, but the route to the site’s servers clearly isn’t. 
This site can’t be reached




As usual, there is no word from TorrentGalaxy’s operators. The site’s regular staff and administrators are also left in the dark, which means that it’s not clear if or when the site will return. 
Occasional downtime is not unusual for these types of sites and TorrentGalaxy has had more than its fair share since new owners took over the site last year. The prolonged downtime is newsworthy, however, as the site is one of the largest torrent communities in existence today. 
The site is also important as a key content supplier to other torrent sites though its upload bots. Interestingly, those bots are still operational, unlike during previous downtime periods. 
TGx Uploads Elsewhere




While these troubles are a concern for pirates, copyright holders will be pleased to see the site gone. Last month, the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) flagged TorrentGalaxy among the most notorious pirate sites. According to the report, the site was one of the main beneficiaries of RARBG’s shutdown in 2023.
Whether recent ‘technical’ troubles are the result of targeted enforcement action isn’t clear, however. The site appears to be hosted, or more likely proxied, though the Ukrainian company Virtual Systems LLC, which has a reputation for providing connectivity and staying out of third party disputes. 
As a result, Virtual Systems was also branded a “notorious piracy market” by the USTR, for allegedly offering “DMCA Ignored” hosting services.
Interestingly, a few weeks ago, TorrentGalaxy claimed that it had trouble paying the bills. When the operators asked users to chip in, hundreds of dollars were donated in Bitcoin. 
While some might connect the current troubles to a lack of funds, there’s no evidence for that either. If the site shut down voluntarily, it would likely put up a message one way or another, which isn’t all that hard. In fact, TGx has quite a bit of experience with spooky messages by now.

19,2025-02-16,"Argentina’s president Javier Milei promised to juice his nation’s economy through anarcho-capitalist policies, and he’s finally engaged in the most anarcho-capitalist thing of all: endorsing a cryptocurrency without researching it only to have the bottom fall out on it almost immediately, allowing insiders to cash out while retail backers hold the bag. Now, according to Reuters, Milei’s opposition is threatening impeachment over the scheme. Oops!
Here’s what happened: Late Friday night, Milei fired off a tweet lending his support to a cryptocurrency token called $LIBRA. Milei described the coin to his nearly four million followers as a “private project dedicated to encouraging the growth of the Argentine economy,” claiming that it would be “funding small Argentine businesses and ventures.”
In under one hour from Milei’s tweet, $LIBRA skyrocketed by 2,000%, per CoinDesk, and reached a market capitalization of nearly $4.5 billion. And then the bottom fell out. As the coin reached its peak trading volume, insiders started to sell off, cashing out the coins that they held before Milei served as their useful idiot. An analysis from BubbleMaps warned that 82% of the token was held by a single cluster, suggesting that the creators and whoever else they looped in on the project were just waiting to get enough dupes on board to jump ship.
And jump ship they did. As Milei’s followers poured in, the insiders got out. In about five hours, nearly $4.5 billion of market cap was wiped out. Financial analysis site The Kobeissi Letter described it as “one of the fastest and largest destructions of wealth in retail trading history.”
Around the same time the collapse was happening, Milei was trying to distance himself from the whole thing. He deleted the original tweet about five hours after posting it, per the New York Timesâwhich would have been right around when the coin value was imploding. He followed that up with another tweet making clear that he had no idea what he was throwing his support behind in the first place.
“A few hours ago I published a tweet, like so many other countless times, supporting a supposed private venture to which I obviously have no connection,” he wrote. “I was not familiar with the details of the project and after having internalized myself I decided not to continue disseminating it (that is why I deleted the tweet).”
He concluded the post by stating, “To the filthy rats of the political caste who want to take advantage of this situation to do harm, I want to say that every day they confirm how lowly politicians are, and increase our conviction to kick their asses out.” Which uh…what are you in this scenario, my guy? You are quite literally the elected official who, without any due diligence, encouraged people to pour their money into a project that was seemingly designed to rug pull. The website for the project was literally created the day of launch. It’s not like this required significant research to determine it was shady.
Milei’s opposition at least seems to believe he holds more responsibility than he’s willing to take on, and is apparently weighing an attempt to impeach the president. âThis scandal, which embarrasses us on an international scale, requires us to launch an impeachment request against the president,â opposition lawmaker Leandro Santoro said, per Reuters.
Milei has not exactly endured himself to Argentinians since taking office in 2023. Elected as an outsider promising to get the nation back on track through extreme measures was it faced staggering inflation, his policies have plunged more than half the population into poverty. Earlier this month, he was the subject of mass protests over his ongoing railing against “wokeism.” Sounds familiar, yeah? Might as well chalk the crypto collapse up to just one more page out of the Donald Trump playbook that Milei is pulling from.

Building a bridge under fire for troops and their armored vehicles is one of the most hazardous of military operations. This became evident in the Ukraine war, where Russian forces have taken heavy casualties as they tried to assault across rivers defended by Ukrainian troops.

        That's why the US Army wants to develop robots that can do the job — and spare the lives of combat engineers.
    

        What the Army envisions are AI-controlled, self-propelled rafts that can autonomously join together to form a bridge and are soliciting ideas from small businesses. It's the combat engineering equivalent of drone swarms, in which hordes of small autonomous UAVs fly in close and self-guided coordination.
    

        ""The fielding of autonomous powered floating bridges will enable the Army to conduct unpredictable dispersed river crossings, increase crew survivability by removing the man from the craft, and reduce logistics footprint over the Improved Ribbon Bridge in use today by combining both payload capacity and powertrain into a single craft,"" according to the Army's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) solicitation.
    

        Perhaps not coincidentally, the proposal comes as even the Army's own engineers question whether it has adequate bridge-building capabilities, especially for ""wet gap"" assaults across defended river lines. While the Army became proficient in such operations during World War II, such as attacking across the Rhine River in 1945, decades of counterinsurgency warfare has come at the expense of skills such as erecting bridges capable of bearing heavy vehicles such as the M1 Abrams.
    

        Some experts also worry that there aren't enough bridge-building units. Or, that Army divisions lack sufficient river-crossing resources without additional engineering support from corps headquarters.
    

        But the real wake-up call has been the Ukraine conflict. In the Napoleonic Wars or World War II, bridge builders faced artillery fire or air attack. Today, an array of drones, long-range tactical missiles, and smart artillery shells are an immense danger to any troops in the open. Not least to Army engineers who might spend up to 30 minutes in the middle of a river while trying to erect the Army's standard Improved Ribbon Bridge, produced by General Dynamics European Land Systems.
    

        Even the Army admits that its current bridging capabilities need to change. ""Future Gap Crossing technology must consider near peer adversarial capabilities and support sustainment operations in a lethal contested logistics environment when the enemy can attack targets at virtually any depth within the battlespace,"" warned the SBIR.
    

        Still, there are numerous technical hurdles to overcome for automated bridge building to become a reality. In particular, there is the challenge of getting a bunch of robots to coordinate their actions, all while preventing ""numerous unmanned robotic rafting bays, all in the general vicinity of each other, from colliding with terrain obstacles (man-made or natural) and each other in potentially turbulent waters,"" the SBIR explained.
    

        Phase I of the project asks for contractors to specify the necessary AI, sensors and communication systems to enable automated bridge-builders to operate. Phase II includes delivering a prototype that can function despite cyberattack, and in a GPS-denied environment (where jammers block the signals from GPS satellites). Other companies that produce are military bridging systems are the European defense firm KNDS and the US-based construction company Acrow.
    

        If the project is successful, it could benefit the commercial market, according to the Army. Potential uses include pipeline inspection, package delivery, undersea exploration, agricultural work and space exploration.
    

        But the main beneficiaries would be sappers whose difficult task will be a little less dangerous. So would tank battalions that won't have to wait as long while a bridge is built under fire, or supply columns that won't present juicy targets while waiting in a traffic jam. Let the robots do the dirty work.

While markets panicked about DeepSeek, the CEO of Mistral welcomed the Chinese startup's new models as a boost for the open-source world. 

        Since its launch in 2023, Paris-based AI startup Mistral has advocated for open-source, which, broadly, is software that anyone can use or modify. 
    

        ""We like to think of DeepSeek as the Mistral of China,"" Arthur Mensch told Business Insider in an interview. ""We think that this is a great moment for open-source models, and companies like this — Mistral and DeepSeek — have participated in that and built on top of each other.""
    

        Like DeepSeek, many of Mistral's large language models are open-weight, which means they primarily share the model parameters rather than the full code base. 
    

        Mensch is one of many in the tech industry who point to the benefits of open source, such as faster development cycles and no extensive licensing fees. 
    

        ""We've always been believers in open-source prevailing because of the flywheel, because of everybody building on top of each other, because of the fact that it just makes things more efficient,"" Mensch told BI.
    

        Last month, investors questioned the scale of large AI infrastructure investments after DeepSeek released R1 models that claimed to match the performance of rival models like ChatGPT — but at a fraction of the cost. 
    

        In addition to raising questions about efficiency, it also prompted a rethink in the AI world about open versus closed source. 
    

        In a Reddit AMA session earlier this month, OpenAI boss Sam Altman admitted to being ""on the wrong side of history"" regarding his stance on open-source AI. He added that the company may need to figure out a new strategy instead of its closed-source approach. 
    

        Mensch said Mistral, which is seen as Europe's answer to OpenAI, has always prioritized efficiency — including when it comes to capital. 
    

        With $1 billion in funding from the likes of Andreessen Horowitz, Lightspeed, and General Catalyst, Mistral takes the mantle of Europe's most-capitalized AI startup. 
    

        ""It doesn't take $100 billion to make enterprises adopt a technology and adapt it to their use cases,"" he said. ""We're a very well-capitalized company, but we're not spending hundreds of billions.""
    

        In addition to touting its open-source ambitions, Mensch told BI that Mistral would expand its capabilities in agentic AI, a type of software that can perform tasks autonomously. 
    

        The startup is doing so with a revamped version of Le Chat, which launched as an app for the first time last week. 
    

        ""Le Chat is a place where you can build your agents, and you should see this as a place where every employee and consumer can create automation and spawn agents,"" he added. The best aspect of AI agents is that non-developers can also use them,"" Mensch said.
    

        The startup also has goals to reduce its dependence on Big Tech; before the Paris Action Summit this week, it announced that it would invest billions of euros in building its own data center in France.
    

        ""It's a choice we are making to have control over the whole value chain, from the machine to the software,"" Mensch told French TV channel TFI.
    

        Mistral is also doubling down on its presence outside its home country. It's expanding in the US, a market where it's seeing a lot more commercial traction, and it has opened a Singapore office in light of a burgeoning user base in southeast Asia.
    

        While Mensch previously indicated that Mistral would eventually go public, he clarified to BI that the company has no immediate plans to pursue that route.
    

        ""I said that we were an independent company, and as a successful independent company, the natural path would obviously be IPO long term — but this obviously doesn't mean that we're preparing anything for an IPO for now,"" he said.

A new textile recycling process holds the promise of cleaning up the planet and boosting the circular economy.
It easily separates cotton from polyester, producing usable glucose from the former and leaving the latter undamaged, per a University of Amsterdam news release published by Phys.org.
The researchers, in partnership with sustainable chemicals company Avantium, used super-concentrated hydrochloric acid on polycotton waste. The acid breaks down the cotton into a glucose solution, and the polyester remains, ""providing the ability to fully recycle both components in subsequent steps,"" the team wrote.
This sidesteps a major issue with textile recycling, as the fibers are difficult to disentangle, ScienceDirect noted in highlights about a different study. It also helps reduce the waste that is burying developing nations; Americans discard 21 billion pounds of clothes every year.
""Being able to recover glucose from the cotton in textile waste is a crucial contribution to this, as glucose is a key bio-based feedstock,"" said Gert-Jan Gruter, head of the industrial sustainable chemistry department at the Van 't Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences at the University of Amsterdam. ""Currently, it is produced from starch from corn and wheat. If and when we will be producing plastics from biomass on a large scale, the world will need a lot of non-food glucose.""
Phys.org published a photograph that showed the results of the process: Just polyester seams and their labels were left after cotton shirts had been bathed in the acid.
""It is the first effective method for recycling both cotton and polyester components of polycotton with high efficiency,"" according to the release.
The project falls under the mixed cotton-polyester waste textiles umbrella, which is years in the making at the University of Amsterdam. It also included textile sorting and recycling company Wieland Textiles, sustainable workwear company Groenendijk Bedrijfskleding, Dutch industry trade association Modint, and polyester recycling technology company CuRe Technology.
The release states that the glucose from the cotton can be used in polymers, resins, and solvents; high yields and those industrial applications show that the method is scalable and affordable.
Amazingly, Avantium can also use the glucose to create ""a crucial component"" of polyethylene furanoate, a biobased material that can be used instead of polyethylene terephthalate, which is used to manufacture plastic containers and polyester.
Gruter said Avantium has ""invested substantially"" in the process with the hope that it leads to the first industrial polycotton textile recycling facility and the first commercially available non-food glucose.
""Many parties are trying to get either of these things done but no one has succeeded yet,"" Gruter said. ""Our ambition is to advance this technology to the next phase of commercialization, together with partners. So we might very well be the first to market non-food glucose obtained through a bio-refinery approach.""

In an investment landscape marked by persistent inflation concerns, political risk and market volatility, dividend-paying stocks have emerged as a compelling option for investors seeking stable income streams alongside potential capital appreciation. As we navigate through early 2025, several blue-chip companies in the S&P 500 offer attractive dividend yields that significantly outpace the average market return.
This analysis delves into 10 dividend-paying stocks that combine generous yields with strong fundamentals and sustainable payout ratios. I've carefully selected these companies based on their financial health, market position and ability to maintain – and potentially increase – their dividend payments in the coming years.
Dividend stocks offer investors a powerful combination of regular income and the potential for long-term capital appreciation. In times of market uncertainty, these investments can provide a reliable income stream that helps offset market volatility. Historical data shows that dividend-paying companies in the S&P 500 have consistently outperformed their non-dividend-paying counterparts over extended periods, with dividend payments accounting for approximately 40% of the index’s total returns since 1930.
Moreover, in the current economic environment of high inflation, changing rates and major political change, dividend stocks provide a hedge against inflation, especially when companies demonstrate a history of regular dividend increases. This combination of steady income and potential growth makes dividend stocks particularly attractive for retirees and income-focused investors looking to build sustainable wealth over time.
When evaluating dividend stocks, investors should examine the dividend yield, representing the annual dividend payment as a percentage of the stock price. However, a higher yield isn’t always better – unusually high yields can signal underlying problems or unsustainable payout ratios. The dividend payout ratio, which measures the percentage of earnings paid as dividends, should typically fall between 40% and 60% for most industries, though this can vary based on the sector.
Financial health indicators are crucial considerations, including the company’s debt levels, free cash flow generation and earnings stability. A strong balance sheet and consistent cash flow growth suggest a company can maintain its dividend payments even during economic downturns. Investors should also look for companies with competitive advantages in their industries and track records of dividend growth, as these factors often indicate sustainable long-term performance.
The company's industry position and growth prospects also merit careful consideration. Firms operating in mature industries with stable cash flows often make reliable dividend payers, while those in highly cyclical or rapidly changing sectors may struggle to maintain consistent payments. Additionally, examining analyst recommendations and institutional ownership can provide insights into the stock's overall market sentiment and potential risks.
The selection methodology prioritized companies within the S&P 500 that demonstrate both high current yields and sustainable dividend practices. I filtered for stocks with dividend yields above 3% and examined their payout ratios, ensuring they fall within reasonable ranges for their respective industries. Companies with payout ratios exceeding 75% were generally excluded unless their business model and cash flow stability justified the higher ratio.
Each selected company was evaluated based on multiple criteria, including financial strength, market position, earnings stability and dividend growth history. I also considered analyst recommendations, recent earnings reports and forward guidance to ensure these high yields are sustainable. Particular attention was paid to each company’s cash flow coverage of dividend payments and their ability to maintain payments during economic downturns.

29,2025-02-16,"According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple is ramping up development on a Studio Display replacement. The company initially debuted this monitor in 2022 and has left it untouched since. There isn’t much word on what’ll be new with this Studio Display refresh, but it’ll apparently be a companion to the upcoming M5 MacBook Pros.
Early last week, display supply chain expert Ross Young reported that Apple is working on a new Studio Display with mini-LED display tech, and now Mark Gurman from Bloomberg is backing that:
I’m told that Apple is currently testing prototypes of a display — code-named J427 — that should arrive by 2026. It will be a successor to the current Studio Display, rather than the Pro Display XDR, and features a design that’s similar to the 2022 model.
Gurman’s reporting is light on details, though he does provide one interesting insight on Apple’s higher end monitor, the Pro Display XDR. After its release in 2019, the company has all but abandoned it. It lacks many features that the newer (and cheaper) Studio Display offer, such as a webcam, built in speakers, and a more affordable built-in stand.
Despite this fact though, it doesn’t seem like Apple has a second gen Pro Display XDR in the pipeline. Gurman reports that a new version is ‘less of a priority for Apple.’ However, Apple remains committed to the professional market, and Gurman reaffirms that new Mac Pro and Mac Studio models are in the pipeline. 
He also mentions that the company will ‘probably’ work on a larger-than-24-inch iMac eventually.

        I'm a TV personality, a CEO, an entrepreneur, and a father. The foundation of all of that was real-estate investing.
    

        There was really no barrier to entry to getting into the business and starting to sell houses other than getting a license. I grew up in a lower-end community in Southern California, and I never knew what was out there until I started looking at real estate.
    

        I've been running Tarek Buys House since 2010 to flip houses and doing commercial real estate for about 10 years. I started TEM Capital about six years ago. I realized I could do much bigger and better deals if I had more money and more partners, and that's how TEM Capital was born. The goal is to help accredited investors increase their wealth by partnering with me to buy real estate.
    

        In 2025, Tarek Buys Houses will probably flip between 300 and 400 houses.
    

        For TEM Capital, we're about to launch our triple equity fund. We'll take houses and turn them into triplexes and fourplexes. We're also about to launch our distressed multifamily fund. Just like I buy, fix, and sell houses, we buy 400-unit apartment buildings, fix them, and sell them.
    

        Here are the six biggest lessons that have contributed to my real estate and business success.
    

        In my first six months in the business, I totally struck out. I wasn't making money, and then, one day, I got hyper-focused and decided to talk to 50 people who owned a house every day.
    

        My real-estate coach told me I had to talk to 20 people a day. I told him I would talk to 50. He said, ""That's what everybody says. Nobody does it."" And I did it.
    

        Ninety days later, I brought in almost $300,000 in revenue for the company, which completely changed my life.
    

        A lot of people believe it takes years to make money. That's not true.
    

        You just have to decide to go for it, put in the work, take the time to learn, study, and practice, and get ready to fail a few times. Eventually, you're going to win.
    

        Make sure you work with the right people. It is a lot of work to find the right people.
    

        I used to be terrified to let people go, change staff, or fire people because I always try to get them to change or improve. Then, I learned it's really about finding that right team member.
    

        You have to hold your team accountable, and you have to hold yourself accountable.
    

        It's important that every one of my team members know that I am as committed to what they are doing as they are.
    

        If you're not talking to people every single day that you do not know, you will never be in the real-estate business.
    

        The money is in the people you do not know. In this business, you look for a needle in a haystack, and the only way to find that needle is to move a lot of hay.
    

        I tell all my staff members every day that our minimum goal is 50 conversations a day with someone we've never talked to.
    

        That's how you learn who needs to sell or who has a distressed property. I know there are people all over the country today thinking, ""Man, we need to sell this house."" They don't know we want to buy it, so we need to find them.
    

        People watch YouTube and read books, but you know what they never do? They never actually go look at a house, call a homeowner about a foreclosure, or call a real-estate agent to ask if they have any off-market distress deals.
    

        The only thing that matters is calling real-estate agents and asking them if they have any distressed properties that you can buy. If someone were to do that all day, every day for a year, they would change their life.
    

        The more pain we go through, the stronger we get.
    

        If I had not gone through all these painful experiences, all these highs and lows of winning and losing and losing money, it wouldn't have made me as strong as I am today.
    

        The only way to continue growing is to accept that you will have to go through painful processes that will help you go further.
    

        You have to acknowledge the fact that life is not fair. You gotta pick up the pieces, keep your head up, and keep going.
    

        I'm a big believer in creating a sleep schedule that works for the life you live. I used to be one of those people who said, ""I'm a night person, blah, blah, blah."" It's an excuse. It's easier to go to bed late than it is to wake up early.
    

        I was feeling overwhelmed by life because I woke up at 6:45 or 7 a.m. Then you have the kids, and you're trying to squeeze in the gym and then go to work. With all of life's responsibilities, I was just out of time.
    

        One day, I decided to start waking up at 4:30, and picking up that extra two hours a day completely changed my life. For the first time, I had two hours of ""me time.""
    

        No one's awake. It's dark downstairs, and I have the fire going. It's my magic hour where I can think and create in peace.
    

        Most people are so overwhelmed by business, family, cellphones, and social media that they never have time for themselves. I'm a big believer that we need some time for ourselves.
    

        I'm evolving every day. I'm learning every day. I'm growing every day.
    

        During my magic hour, I'm studying. I'm reading. I'm learning about AI. I'm learning about technology. I'm learning about marketing. I'm learning about systems. I'm watching YouTube videos.
    

        When I drive to the gym every morning, I leave my house at 6:40 and listen to books on Audible for 20 minutes. I then get there, do cardio, and listen to more books. I'm always educating myself.
    

        I'm all about killing two birds with one stone. If I have a conference call or something, I'll go for a walk. That way, I can get my cardio in while being on a call and I'm not even noticing that I'm walking.

31,2025-02-16,"These five Berkshire Hathaway holdings represent compelling investment opportunities for long-term ... [+] investors in 2025.
Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio has long served as a beacon for value investors seeking quality companies with durable competitive advantages. As we move through 2025, several of Berkshire's holdings stand out as attractive investments, combining strong fundamentals with reasonable valuations despite the broader market's continued focus on technology and growth stocks.
This analysis examines five of the most promising Berkshire Hathaway positions that offer investors strong business models, competitive moats and potential for long-term capital appreciation. Each selection represents a company that aligns with Buffett's investment philosophy and appears well-positioned for success in today's evolving economic landscape.
Buffett’s investment strategy centers on identifying companies with strong competitive advantages, capable management teams and the ability to generate consistent free cash flow. His philosophy emphasizes purchasing great businesses at reasonable prices rather than mediocre businesses at bargain prices. This approach has proven successful through multiple market cycles, with Berkshire Hathaway delivering compound annual returns well above market averages over several decades.
The “Oracle of Omaha” focuses on businesses he understands, avoiding complex technologies or models lacking transparent earnings potential. He prioritizes companies with pricing power, strong brand recognition and the ability to maintain or expand market share even during economic downturns. This conservative yet effective approach has made Buffett one of history's most successful investors.
This selection process focused on Berkshire Hathaway’s current portfolio holdings, analyzing each position based on fundamental strength, market position and alignment with Buffett's investment principles. I prioritized companies with strong cash flows, reasonable valuations and durable competitive advantages. Special attention was paid to recent business performance, management effectiveness and potential catalysts for future growth.
Each selected company was evaluated against current market conditions and sector-specific challenges. I considered factors such as return on equity, debt levels and free cash flow generation. Additionally, I examined each company's ability to maintain or grow market share in their respective industries while delivering consistent returns to shareholders.
Bank of America is one of the largest financial institutions in the United States, serving approximately 66 million consumers and small business clients with about 4,000 retail financial centers. The bank has successfully transformed its digital capabilities, with over 90% of all consumer transactions now conducted through digital channels. Their conservative lending practices and strong balance sheet position them well in the current economic environment.
Bank of America represents Berkshire's largest financial sector holding, with a stake now valued north of $35 billion and accounting for more than 8% of Berkshire's portfolio, and for good reason. The bank's diversified revenue streams, with consumer banking contributing around 35% of revenue, wealth management above 20%, and investment banking approximately 25%, coupled with a tier 1 capital ratio exceeding 11%, position it well amid varying economic conditions. Their strong capital position, with stress test results showing capacity to maintain dividends even under severe economic scenarios, and focus on operational efficiency – demonstrated by a cost-to-income ratio below 60% and declining – make it well-positioned to benefit from the current interest rate environment above 5%. Net interest income margins have expanded north of 2.5%, contributing to return on equity around 15%. Recent investments exceeding $3.5 billion annually in digital technology have improved customer satisfaction scores above 80% while reducing operating costs by approximately 20% per transaction, leading to enhanced profitability metrics. Digital engagement now exceeds 75% of total consumer interactions, with mobile users growing at around 10% annually. The bank's efficiency ratio has improved to below 60%, while maintaining a loan-to-deposit ratio around 70%, providing ample liquidity for future growth. Their wealth management division alone generates over $5 billion in annual revenue, with client balances north of $3 trillion, providing stable fee-based income regardless of interest rate fluctuations.
Coca-Cola remains the world's largest non-alcoholic beverage company, with a portfolio of more than 200 brands sold in over 200 countries. The company's recent strategic initiatives have focused on expanding its presence in growing categories such as ready-to-drink coffee, sports drinks, and premium waters. Their adaptive business model has successfully responded to changing consumer preferences while maintaining strong brand equity.
As one of Buffett's longest-held positions, acquired for less than $1.3 billion and now worth north of $25 billion, Coca-Cola exemplifies his preference for businesses with strong brands and pricing power, demonstrated by operating margins above 30% despite inflationary pressures and ability to maintain price increases around 8% annually without significant volume impact. The company's extensive distribution network, reaching over 200 markets globally and servicing north of 25 million retail customer outlets, coupled with marketing capabilities exceeding $4 billion annually, create significant barriers to entry. Their market share exceeds 45% in global carbonated beverages, while maintaining a presence in over 80% of all food service locations worldwide. The company's strategic expansion into healthier beverages, with non-carbonated brands growing at around 15% annually and now representing more than 30% of portfolio revenue, effectively addresses changing consumer trends. Premium water brands alone contribute north of $7 billion in annual revenue, growing at double-digit rates. The company has increased its dividend for 61 consecutive years, demonstrating remarkable consistency in shareholder returns, with a payout ratio around 75% and free cash flow conversion exceeding 95% of net income. Their return on invested capital remains above 20%, while maintaining a global brand value estimated north of $90 billion, making it one of the most valuable brands worldwide.
Apple has evolved from a computer manufacturer into a global technology ecosystem encompassing hardware, software and services. The company's iPhone remains its flagship product, but its services segment, including Apple Music, iCloud and the App Store, has grown to represent over 20% of revenue. Recent ventures into augmented reality and artificial intelligence demonstrate its continued innovation leadership.
Despite being a technology company, Apple fits Buffett's investment criteria through its industry-leading brand loyalty, with retention rates north of 90% in its core iPhone business, unmatched pricing power evidenced by average selling prices around 50% higher than competitors, and massive cash generation exceeding $100 billion annually. The company's ecosystem creates high switching costs through over 2 billion active devices globally, while its services business, growing at around 15% annually and maintaining margins above 70%, provides recurring revenue streams now accounting for north of 25% of total revenue. Apple's share repurchase program, having returned over $600 billion to shareholders since inception and reducing share count by approximately 25%, combines with a dividend that's grown at a double-digit rate for over a decade. The company's fortress balance sheet, with north of $150 billion in cash and investments, and market leadership position – commanding around 50% of the premium smartphone market in North America and maintaining App Store gross margins above 80% – make it a compelling long-term investment. The company's emerging revenue streams, including wearables growing at over 20% annually and representing a market size larger than 75% of Fortune 500 companies, coupled with its nascent AI initiatives and rumored electric vehicle ambitions, provide multiple vectors for future growth while maintaining operating margins above 30%.
Occidental Petroleum is a leading oil and gas producer with premier assets in the Permian Basin. The company’s integrated business model includes chemical manufacturing and carbon management solutions. Recent investments in carbon capture technology and low-carbon initiatives position OXY as a leader in sustainable energy production.
Buffett's significant stake in Occidental, now representing north of 25% ownership of the company, reflects his confidence in the company's management and long-term energy market position in the Permian Basin, where OXY maintains around 40% lower production costs compared to industry averages. The company's robust free cash flow generation, exceeding $3 billion quarterly at current oil prices, coupled with a strengthened balance sheet that has reduced net debt by more than 50% since 2020, supports continued dividend growth and an aggressive share repurchase program targeting around 15% of market cap annually. Operating margins hover above 30%, significantly outpacing industry peers, while the return on capital employed remains north of 20%. OXY's leadership in carbon capture technology, with over $5 billion committed to direct air capture facilities and enhanced oil recovery methods yielding around 25% higher recovery rates than conventional methods, provides substantial competitive advantages in an increasingly environmentally conscious industry. The company's carbon management business is projected to contribute north of $1 billion in annual revenue by 2027, while its enhanced oil recovery techniques reduce carbon intensity by approximately 20% compared to traditional extraction methods. OXY maintains significant financial flexibility even in challenging price environments with a breakeven price below $40 per barrel and operating costs in the lowest quartile of global producers.
Moody's is a leading global integrated risk assessment firm, providing credit ratings, research, tools and analysis that contribute to transparent financial markets. The company's analytics division has expanded significantly, offering software solutions for risk management, financial analysis, and regulatory compliance. Recent acquisitions have strengthened its position in ESG and climate risk assessment.
Moody's exemplifies Buffett's preference for companies with wide economic moats and predictable earnings, demonstrated by its industry-leading operating margins of just under 50% and return on equity in the 70-80% range. The company's oligopolistic market position in credit ratings, with a 32% global market share, coupled with high entry barriers and strong recurring revenue from its analytics business – which now accounts for over 30% of total revenue and grew by over 15% year-over-year – creates a powerful competitive advantage. The analytics division's recurring revenue model has pushed contract renewal rates to north of 90%, while the average contract value has increased by double digits annually over the past three years. Growing demand for risk assessment tools and ESG analytics, evidenced by 35% + growth in ESG-related revenues and a pipeline of (over $2.5 billion) in potential analytics contracts, provides additional growth opportunities while maintaining high margins. The company's asset-light business model generates exceptional free cash flow conversion of over 75% of net income, supporting reinvestment in growth initiatives and shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks.
These five Berkshire Hathaway holdings represent compelling investment opportunities for long-term investors in 2025. Each company possesses the characteristics Buffett values: strong competitive positions, capable management teams and the ability to generate consistent cash flows. From Bank of America's financial strength to Apple's ecosystem dominance, and from Coca-Cola's brand power to Occidental's energy leadership and Moody's market dominance, these selections offer a diversified approach to value investing aligned with Buffett's time-tested principles. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, these companies appear well-positioned to deliver sustainable returns in the years ahead.

The year 1950 brought to the world an invention so useful, we’d be living an altogether different lifestyle had it not been there. I’m talking about the Solid-State Drives (SSD) that have evolved from large bulky pieces of hardware into pocketable accessories that’s the holy grail for most of us. The transfer speeds have improved exponentially, and so have the reliability and performance.
Seagate has been part of this evolution for over a decade, virtually earning a major chunk of the SSD market. The California-based data storage specialist has now unveiled an SSD so small, it’ll give your flash drive nightmares. That I say because this ultra compact accessory will eventually supersede your trusted USB drive, since it is superior both in performance and reliability. Not to mention the palm-sized form factor that’ll make it a go-to accessory for every kind of user – be it a video creator, coder, or gamer.
Designer: Seagate






The Ultra Compact SSD designed by Seagate is a USB-C thumb drive that can handle large files or performance-intensive processes like running an operating system without any hassle. Created in 1TB and 2TB capacities, the portable SSD is far smaller than any of the known compact SSDs on the market. Now, that is both a design and functionality evolution. With transfer speeds of 1,000 MB/s, the accessory will be a staple for photographers and videographers who require portable storage solutions with at least a 1TB capacity and performance that can handle current generation OS.

Measuring just 70 millimeters in length and 20 millimeters in width, the Seagate SSD is lightweight at just 24 grams. It comes with an IP54 dust and water resistance rating, and comes with a rubber sleeve protection to guard against any sudden drops or falls of up to 3 meters. Keeping in mind the eco-friendly manufacturing methods, the SSD is made using 35 percent recycled materials. For convenience of use, it can be plugged right into your gaming console, handheld console, Windows, Mac, Android phone, or Apple device courtesy of the USB-C port connectivity. Seagate has a lot of confidence in its hardware solution and this compact SSD is no different. It comes with a 3-year limited warranty and 3 years of Seagate Rescue Data RecoveryServices for complete peace of mind.






The portable peripheral comes included with some more freebies including an intuitive Seagate Toolkit backup software to backup important files and sync ongoing projects to the drive. It comes with a 6-month Dropbox Backup to back up one computer and one drive automatically to the service. Additionally, you can also utilize the free 6 months of Mylio Photos+ service to organize and edit your photos or videos. Seagate will make the Ultra-Compact SSD available worldwide this month for a price of $100 for the 1TB version and $180 for the 2TB variant. It is a good deal if you require a portable SSD that can do more than just data transfer, and I’m sure it’ll become a holy grail of your everyday carry essentials.

Pandora's jewellery pieces are sold in more than 100 countries via approximately 7,800 retailers. (Photo by Ida Marie Odgaard / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark OUT (Photo by IDA MARIE ODGAARD/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images)
U.S. jewelry sales advanced a tepid 1.3% in 2024, driven primarily by price increases as the number of units sold dropped 1.6%, according to industry analyst Edahn Golan of Tenoris.
Yet, while American consumers largely hit the pause button on new jewelry purchases, the accessible-luxury jewelry brand Pandora posted 8% same-store sales growth in the U.S. last year.
With the U.S. being Pandora’s number one market accounting for 31% of total revenues, organic sales in the U.S. advanced 14% to $1.3 billion (DKK 9,709 million), fueled by the addition of 37 new concept stores and acquiring 36 stores from partners.
Pandora global sales went into overdrive too, up 13% organically and 7% like-for-like, to $4.4 billion (DKK 31,680). Contributing to the organic growth were 236 new stores, including 137 Pandora concept stores and 99 Pandora-owned shop-in-shops, ending the year with nearly 7,000 points-of-sale. That includes a mix of Pandora-owned, franchise-owned and third-party distribution across the globe.
And while its core jewelry charm-and-bracelet segment accounted for 74% of total sales, its extended full-jewelry segment, called “Fuel with more,” including lab-grown diamonds, was on fire, up 22% to $1.1 billion (DKK 8,149).
One can argue Pandora is growing in a stagnant market because it has the right product at the right price in all the right places with the right promotion and for the right people, i.e. the traditional 4Ps of marketing plus the missing P-people.
CEO Alexander Lacik says that the P-formula still applies but it is only the tactical piece. And in the face of a slowing market, many companies leaned into the price and promotion part of the equation to boost sales.
“It’s the highest level of promotions we’ve seen in my six years at Pandora and we have seen a negative sentiment in the industry over the past couple of years,” shared CEO Alexander Lacik with me.
“What emerged at the end of last year and also continuing into this year is that more brands are struggling and moving to heavier discounting to get the sales volume they need,” he continued. “There’s not a lot of volume out there and when you go for the volume, you pay for the volume.”
The downward promotional spiral leads to commoditization, ultimately threatening long-term sustainable growth once the market returns. Instead of pushing for volume through discounting, though he admits Pandora has “partaken to some extent,” Pandora has invested in brand building, the results of which are now showing.
Interbrand named Pandora to the 100 best global brands in 2024 where it sits alongside Tiffany, Cartier, Louis Vuitton, Hermès, Chanel, Gucci, Dior and Prada.
“In any market condition, there will be winners and losers, and it’s usually the brands that continue investing in their identity and customer relationships that emerge stronger. This is the essence of our Phoenix strategy, and six consecutive quarters of double-digit growth in a challenging market show that it is working,” Lacik asserted.
When Lacik joined Pandora in 2019, after years of working with CPG giants Procter & Gamble and Reckitt, he faced the career challenge of a lifetime. Revenues had been flat for the two preceding years at around $3 billion, then the pandemic hit and sales went into a tailspin, dropping 8% in 2019 and another 11% in 2021 to $2.7 billion, below 2016 levels.
The turnaround began in May 2021 with the introduction of Pandora’s Phoenix strategy with the goal of achieving between 5% and 7% organic compound annual growth rate from 2021 to 2023 and since revised to between 7% and 9% CAGR from 2023 to 2026.
The Phoenix strategy hinges on four growth pillars:
Building upon Pandora’s strength as an affordable, collectible and emotionally evocative charm-and-bracelet brand, it set out to expand its product assortment into new jewelry product categories with an elevated design sensibility.
Key to brand transformation was to step-up the presentation of the evolving product offerings in stores with a new store concept called Evoke 2.0. By 2026 some 60% of Pandora’s owned and operated stores will be under the Evoke 2.0 model.
The strategy distinguished its collections between Core collections, i.e. Moments and Pandora ME, which are the brand’s charm-and-bracelet core that share similar design aesthetics, and “Fuel with more” that expand the range into a full-jewelry assortment with new design sensibilities to appeal to both current customers and bring in new customers, such as its lab-grown diamond collection of rings, necklaces, earrings and bracelets.
Brand collaborations, such as with Disney, Marvel, HBO’s Game of Thrones and Netflix, stretch the brand further to a wider audience.
Pandora continues to see opportunities for growth in new markets, to continue to build in established markets where it has high market share, such as the U.K., Italy and Australia, and to expand into what it describes as “less penetrated markets,” notably the U.S., Germany, France and China.
In the U.S., the Pheonix strategy set out to double business from the 2019 base year of $660 million, which it has achieved. And now it looks to continue to grow as market share in the U.S. is in the low single-digit levels.
China is more problematic. It was hit harder by Covid and didn’t bounce back as other markets did. Lacik expects building a substantial business in China – it currently represents about 1% of revenues – will be a “longer journey than originally anticipated.”
He added, “All the research that I’m reading is that the consumer sentiment in China is the lowest it’s been since that research has been going on. And it doesn’t necessarily seem to be going better, to be honest.”
Personalizing the customer experience is a multiple-prong initiative across customized IRL experiences with store personnel, in-store engraving services, a new loyalty program and an enhanced digital experience.
It just launched an enhanced Pandora website with more video presentations and supported by AI in Canada and Italy. Following its proven “test-and-learn” process, it will be expanding that platform into new markets as the year progresses.
As the world’s largest jewelry brand, Pandora has a special responsibility to lead the industry in sustainability and good business practices. It transitioned to fully-recycled gold and silver in 2024 and been named to Corporate Knights’ and Time Magazine’s list of the 100 world’s most sustainable brands. It also has a long-term mission to reduce emissions throughout its value chain in half by 2030 and be net-zero by 2040.
Lacik has also been named to the board of the Watch & Jewellery Initiative 2030, a coalition of leading jewelry companies committed to ESG and sustainability in the industry where he’ll rub shoulders with leaders of the world’s luxury jewelry brands.
Coming to Pandora as an outsider with no prior jewelry experience has worked to Lacik’s advantage guiding Pandora into its next phase of growth. He isn’t blinded by the industry’s conventional thinking and sees opportunities where an industry insider might not.
That is evident in his thinking about the digital connection with customers that Pandora will bring forward to new markets after it tests-and-learns from the prototypes introduced in Italy and Canada.
“Online is actually my number one store, say we get some 700 to 900 million visitors a year. But only about 2% actually convert, which is pretty typical of other brands. Many marketers spend time talking about what would happen if we could go from 2% to 2.1% or 2.2% conversion rate. But if you are in a two-to-2.1% mindset, that’s incremental; you’re only tinkering with stuff.
“We must think another way. What about the 98% who are walking away? How can we get more of those 98% engaged with us and keep them from leaving. That’s what we are looking at and the first step is what we’ve done in Canada and Italy. It is actually quite promising.”

As a side benefit, OnePlus will use lab sensors to ""improve the ability of self-developed algorithms, allowing smartwatches to better monitor exercise capacity and cardiopulmonary health.""
That may all sound a bit intense, but it's no surprise. Dive into the career pages for Apple and Google, and you'll find open jobs related to clinical studies, health sensor development, data center construction, health privacy, biophotonics — the list truly goes on and on. Cardiologists and smartwatch engineers have intertwined career paths in Big Tech.
Some of this research goes into new health data points; Apple is reportedly closing in on blood pressure tracking, while a Samsung exec hinted last month that non-invasive blood glucose monitoring is coming soon. Pulling that off takes serious R&D.
Other research focuses on better HR algorithms for athletes, like Google claiming the Pixel Watch 3 has the ""most accurate heart rate for running yet"" to try and pull customers away from fitness brands like Garmin and Polar. This watch was also the first with a ""Loss of Pulse"" feature.
But to be frank, courting athletes or consumers with health issues won't justify this investment. Google didn't buy Fitbit for $2.1 billion just to make its future Pixel Watches more accurate, and OnePlus's new sports lab isn't really about the casual athletes that wear its watches.

I believe a business-to-business (B2B) battle is coming for smartwatches (and smart rings) that are all trying to be the clinical, portable option for other industries. They're all racing to collect your data and use it to self-improve their results until they can aim their sights higher. And you getting heart health warnings or daily workout recommendations is only a side effect.

The other smartwatch health news that prompted this column was Apple announcing its latest Health Study on how to use technology to ""predict, detect, monitor, and manage changes in participants’ health,"" across ""a number of health and disease areas, including activity, aging, cardiovascular health, circulatory health, cognition, hearing, menstrual health, mental health, metabolic health, mobility, neurologic health, respiratory health, sleep, and more.""
This ambitious, holistic study isn't being handled in a creepy way: It's an opt-in program with options on what you share with researchers, and Apple itself doesn't get identifying information.
What it will get is the overall results, from potentially millions of customers, showing which data its watches successfully track and which areas it fails at, adding context that it can't normally find out on its own.
That kind of data can be incredibly valuable for preventative care, if it can analyze your health and workout trends and warn you of potential changes to your physiology or mental capacity. That could help you, but it'll certainly help Apple keep you in its device ecosystem if it keeps marketing its Watches as life-saving.
Everyone is intrigued by blood pressure and glucose, but we're seeing right now how smartwatches are analyzing your AGEs Index, arterial stiffness, and other niche bodily health information that's tied to long-term health warning signs. I don't think any consumers were asking for this; I think it's a proof of concept for doctors to prove how useful these devices can be if they join forces.
Imagine if Apple partnered with your healthcare provider and could key in its watches to look out for specific biomarkers related to your condition or genetics. Some smartwatches can already collect data to send to your doctor, but perhaps these apps could automatically send reports, either at regular intervals or whenever there's a sustained issue with a given metric.

Smart ring sales are so niche that they're barely worth mentioning compared to smartwatches. But I think it's relevant that so many smart ring brands at CES pushed their medical-grade accuracy and brought up unprompted the idea of B2B sales to medical companies.
The Circular Ring 2 ditched the company's trademark haptic engine for an FDA-approved ECG; in the CEO's words, they're transitioning from wellness to an alternative for ""expensive"" and ""invasive"" medical checks. The Evie Ring got FDA approval for blood oxygen readings, and its CEO also labeled it as a ""clinical-grade device for B2B channels."" Ultrahuman wants you to send them blood so they can compare your smart ring data against your biomarkers, and Oura has its new Symptom Radar to link your biometrics with possible causes.
These new companies want to leapfrog wellness straight into the health industry for a reason. Either they think it's a market ready to be tapped, or they think ""wellness"" alone will be seen as less marketable or profitable very soon. Whether smart rings are successful against Big Tech brands with more resources to throw into this gambit, they're shooting their shot.
There's nothing inherently wrong with Apple Watches, Android smartwatches, or smart rings becoming so accurate that they can be relied upon for clinical trials. You can be skeptical that they're as accurate as these companies want them to be, but I won't censure them for striving for something potentially unattainable instead of coasting on ""wellness"" estimates.
What I worry about — and I've written about this before — is that it's genuinely tough to be confronted by bad smartwatch readings on a daily basis.
Anyone would want their watch to catch signs of a heart attack so you can call your doctor. But if they start tracking your body's poor health markers that signal potential issues years or decades down the line, will that help you turn your life around, or just send you spiraling into stress and fatalism?

I know someone who spotted a potential kidney issue because their smart scale told them they were constantly dehydrated no matter how much water they drank. This was vital information to know, but in the aftermath, the smart scale app continued to warn them. They started checking this data more often, hoping lifestyle changes would immediately fix the problem; when nothing helped, they felt hopeless.
Of course I want to know if I have arterial stiffness or high blood sugar, but once I do know, I'll continue to be confronted by this information. Smartwatches have all these gamefied tools like daily rings meant to encourage you to become healthier, but some health issues can't be solved by a gung-ho attitude.
I won't be surprised if, within the next five to ten years, we start seeing more doctors prescribing smartwatches and smart rings for at-home monitoring as an affordable alternative to expensive equipment, with these brands offering a spinoff healthcare app that highlights specific information shared with you and your doctor.
The current AI revolution will play into this, of course. Medical journals are already being fed into specialized AIs; the next step is for your actual health data and testing results to power future insights. Apple's research study and OnePlus's specialized lab will only become increasingly common, feeding AI data that (again) these companies can sell to healthcare providers.
The side effect of this is simple: You're going to get bombarded with more and more health and wellness information the moment you put on your smartwatch. And some people will be overwhelmed by it.
You can mentally prepare yourself for bad news before visiting a doctor; it's harder to do the moment you wake up and see a health warning in your smartwatch's Morning Report.

45,2025-02-16,"Researchers at the University of Cambridge have built a solar-powered reactor that converts atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) into a gas that could one day fuel vehicles, power off-the-grid dwellings, and even produce pharmaceutical products.
The researchers say were inspired by photosynthesis and claim that their technology can be scaled up more easily than earlier solar-powered devices. The team’s research was published todayÂ in the journal Nature Energy.
Carbon capture and storage (which is exactly what it sounds like) is a possible means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The problem is that most carbon capture technologies are themselves powered by burning fossil fuelsânot to mention the fact that the CO2 captured in the process needs to be stored somewhere, such as deep underground. But a new reactor could solve all of that.
“What if instead of pumping the carbon dioxide underground, we made something useful from it?” Sayan Kar, a chemist at the University of Cambridge and first author on the study, said in a university statement. “CO2 is a harmful greenhouse gas, but it can also be turned into useful chemicals without contributing to global warming.”
Kar and his colleaguesâ new reactor is completely solar-powered, meaning it requires no cables or batteries. At night, it filters CO2 from the airâsimilar to how a sponge soaks up water, according to the researchers. During the day, sunlight heats up the collected CO2, which absorbs the Sun’s infrared radiation while a semiconductor powder absorbs the ultraviolet radiation. A mirror on the reactor concentrates the sunlight for greater efficiency in the system.
The absorption initiates a chemical reaction in the reactor that converts the CO2 into synthesis gas, or syngas, a mixture of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2) that is an important ingredient in the production of many fuels and chemicals. The team is currently researching how to convert this solar syngas into liquid fuels that could one day sustainably power vehicles like cars and planes.
“If we made these devices at scale, they could solve two problems at once: removing CO2 from the atmosphere and creating a clean alternative to fossil fuels,” said Kar. “CO2 is seen as a harmful waste product, but it is also an opportunity.”
The researchers claim that a solar reactor of this kind could even be used by individuals (as opposed to powering an entire neighborhood or town) to provide energy for remote locations. Furthermore, because of syngas’ prevalence in the production of chemicals, solar syngas could also lessen the carbon footprint of the chemical sector.
“Instead of continuing to dig up and burn fossil fuels to produce the products we have come to rely on, we can get all the CO2 we need directly from the air and reuse it,” said Erwin Reisner, a chemist at the University of Cambridge who led the study. “We can build a circular, sustainable economyâif we have the political will to do it.”
Here’s hoping that weâll be seeing solar-carbon-capture-reactor-powered cars on the market sooner than we think.

Apple Studio Display
Apple's rumored update to the Apple Studio Display may not arrive in 2025 after all, with a release in 2026 now expected for the premium Mac display.  On Thursday, a report claimed an update for the Apple Studio Display is in development, which could bring an improved miniLED backlight to the design. However, a few days later, another report states that the timeline is a bit longer than first offered. According to Bloomberg's ""Power On"" newsletter on Sunday, the claim of a new 27-inch Apple Studio Display is repeated. The new model is said to have a similar design to the 2022 original, and ""roughly"" the same size of screen. This time, however, it is said that the device is being prototyped by Apple, in a very early stage of the design and production process. Codenamed J427, the report doesn't offer any new specification details. However, the new model will apparently be marketed as a companion item to the M5 MacBook Pro lineup. While the Apple Studio Display is getting a refresh, the same can't be said for the Pro Display XDR. It is reasoned that the $5,000 monitor is less of a priority due to it being far out of reach for most consumers, though Apple is still interested in the professional market. Dueling schedulesSundays report by Mark Gurman offers a timeline that is longer than that proposed by Ross Young of Display Supply Chain Consultants. In Thursday's report, Young said a release later in 2025 was on the cards for the model. The late 2025 period is close enough to 2026 that a delay in production could result in a 2026 introduction rather than 2025. Both Gurman and Young have good track records when it comes to Apple products on the horizon, however Young is a specialist in displays. Young also offered more detail about the potential display. That includes a switch of the LED backlighting system for a miniLED version. The change can allow for the use of localized dimming, increasing the range of shades the display can output, approaching the levels of OLED panels. Young also brought up that ProMotion could be introduced with the screen. Rather than the 60Hz screen the existing Apple Studio Display can output, a ProMotion version would infer there would be an adaptive refresh rate system, which could go as high as 120Hz.

I wonder if they'd bump the size up to a 30"" display? I would be nice to see 120Hz ProMotion. Or, perhaps they'll offer the same 27"" Studio Display for a cheaper price ($1199 or something like that) and then offer a more expensive 30"" Studio Display and then obviously the XDR display for a lot more. I would really like to have (2) 27"" Studio Displays but I also don't wanna spend $3500 on displays lol. They'd be a lot better than the cheaper LG 27"" 2k displays I have now.

 Highly unlikely to be a 30” display since Apple maintains a 218 ppi with a 5k display being 27” while the 6k is 32”.  A 30” would mean a 5.5k display (weird) or Apple would need to drop the ppi to 196 and neither seems plausible.

My guess, similar to iPad Pro. Same resolution, physically smaller (perhaps thinner) and smaller bezels.Needs TB5 hub replacing TB3 or monitor still born.

Unless it is a chip swap and camera bump, Apple seems incapable of delivering anything in any sort of a reasonable time frame. Apple Watch Ultra they were able to come up with a new color and not even a better chip. The one product they did “rush” (after years of development) seems to be a bit of a failure necessitating a move to third parties to clear out their inventory of goggles. Apple “Intelligence” that they have been working on for 7 years I think Cook said has had a faltering rollout too. TL:DR it is no surprise that they will take years and years more work on this before it finally, if ever, sees the light of day.

Two of the best teams in college basketball square off on Sunday afternoon as the No. 5 LSU Tigers (25-1) head to Austin to play the No. 3 Texas Longhorns (25-2). LSU and Texas are in line to receive a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. Both would take one step closer to that accomplishment with a win.
For LSU, it’s been as usual. Since Kim Mulkey arrived in 2021, LSU has a record of 116-15. The Tigers famously won the National Championship in 2023, knocking off Caitlin Clark and the Iowa Hawkeyes. LSU has the talent to win another title thanks to the tandem of Flau’Jae Johnson and Aneesah Morrow. For Texas, Vic Shaffer has turned the Longhorns into a national power since taking over in 2020. Texas reached the Elite Eight last season, but they have what it takes to reach the Final Four, especially thanks to the play of Madison Booker.
This will be the lone regular-season meeting between LSU and Texas. However, these two teams could meet in the SEC tournament next month. Keep reading for information on how to watch the game between LSU and Texas, including the start time, channel, and streaming options. Read our NCAA women’s basketball March to the Madness guide for more coverage.

After a week off due to fourth-round action in the FA Cup, the Premier League returns to action with the 245th Merseyside Derby between Everton and Liverpool. Also known as the ""friendly derby,"" the match between Everton and Liverpool dates back to 1894. It's an emotional Merseyside Derby for Everton, as it will be the last to be contested in Goodison Park. Goodison Park will be demolished after the 2024-2025 season, and Everton will move to Bramley-Moore Dock. The Merseyside Derby was postponed in December and moved to February due to unplayable weather conditions.

CyberMedia Research (CMR) has published an analysis of the Indian tablet market in 2024 and it brings some great news for Samsung.
According to the research firm, in Q4 2024, Samsung had a 29% share in the Indian tablet market, putting it in the first position on the chart. For reference, in Q4 2023, the South Korean tech giant had a 19% market share. That means the company has made tremendous progress.
In the second and third place are Lenovo and Apple with 23% and 21% market share. Xiaomi and Realme are in the fourth and fifth positions with 16% and 3% pie of the cake as you can see below. In Q4 2023, Apple led the chart with a 25% market share and Samsung was in second place.

Samsung was behind Apple in India in CY2024
If you take the whole of last year into consideration (CY2024), Samsung had a 28% market share, putting it in the second position on the chart. In the first place is Apple with a 29% market share. That means Samsung was very close to beating Apple in the full-year tablet shipments in India.
For your reference, in CY2023, Apple and Samsung had 25% and 23% market share respectively with the iPad maker leading the chart and the South Korean tech giant in the second position. It means that the two brands have captured more market than others and Samsung closed the gap with Apple.

Samsung’s Galaxy Tab A9 Plus 5G made 68% of the tablets the company shipped in 2024, making it the brand’s primary growth driver. Considering that the report claims that the premium tablet market saw a growth surge, we assume that the Galaxy Tab S10 was also sold very well.
CMR predicts that the Indian tablet market will see 10% to 15% growth in 2025. Considering the pace at which Samsung is progressing, we expect that it will overtake Apple in terms of full-year sales next year.

49,2025-02-16,"Using portable EEGs, researchers found that when groups of people watch the same health promotion videos, their brain activity syncs up, indicating that the message has gone beyond being seen and heard. This approach could lead to ‘neural’ focus groups and more effective health campaigns.
Think about an advertising jingle you heard as a kid but still remember. That, right there, is an example of effective marketing. These days, marketing is tough. Competition for attention, shorter attention spans, misinformation and distrust, personal algorithms and echo chambers make it increasingly difficult to market products effectively, especially critical messages like health campaigns.
Researchers from the University of Konstanz in Germany led a recent study using portable electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the brain activity of groups of people watching videos of health messages about risky alcohol consumption. Their findings put us a step closer to what would effectively be next-level focus groups, so-called neuromarketing that uses brain-based information to make marketing more effective.
“Unfortunately, not all health campaigns are equally effective, as our research on the effectiveness of anti-alcohol health campaigns has shown,” said Harald Schupp, a psychology professor at the University of Konstanz in Germany and the study’s co-corresponding author.
For decades, focus groups have been used because they’re an effective way of gathering qualitative data and insights from potential consumers. The researchers in the present study thought the process could be improved by complementing these self-report measures with objective, neuroscientific ones that may be outside of conscious awareness.
“With neural measures, we can track the processes occurring in the brains of study participants as they watch these videos – something we cannot do with a survey,” Schupp said. “Neural measures thus provide us with tools for analyzing dynamic stimuli – like video or audio recordings – and, when combined with survey data, they greatly strengthen the overall analysis.”
They used inter-subject correction (ISC) analysis, which assesses how a stimulus, such as a video, triggers similar brain responses across audience members. So, instead of collecting neural metrics at the individual level, ISC identifies common effects seen in the brains of multiple subjects. The researchers had, in a previous study, shown that strong health messages against risk alcohol use produced heightened EEG-ISC in the lab. With this study they wanted to collect neural data from several study participants grouped together in a regular room, so they used a low-density portable EEG.
EEG is a non-invasive way of recording brain-generated electrical waves via electrodes applied directly to the scalp, or a cap with electrodes in it can be worn instead. The number of sensors used to record brain activity can vary from one to hundreds. A standard EEG uses 19 to 32 electrodes, a high-density EEG uses 64, 128, or 256, and a low-density EEG uses between one and 32 electrodes. In this study, the EEG was a 24-electrode system. Data from independent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans was used to link their ISC findings to particular brain regions.
“The present study is an effort to move health communication neuroscience from a basic feasibility – or ‘can it work?’ – stage to a more practical implementation – or ‘does it work in practice’ – stage,” said the researchers. “To this end, we used a series of strong and weak video health messages against risky alcohol use. These messages previously elicited distinct differences in both self-reported perceived message effectiveness and synchronized brain reactions, as captured by fMRI- and EEG-ISC.”
Forty-one participants, 24 females and 17 males, with an average age of 23, were recruited for the study. Half participated in a group watching session, where six participants at a time watched video health messages while sitting in a room in a semicircle. The other half watched the videos one person at a time in the same room. Laptops received the wirelessly transmitted EEG signal.
For each video, participants rated its perceived effectiveness, argument strength, and the amount of threatening or shocking content. To gauge change in alcohol-related risk perceptions and behavior, self-report data about alcohol consumption was collected prior to treatment, immediately after the video session, and at a four-week follow-up.
The study’s findings demonstrated several things of importance. First, there was a high degree of correlation between ISC data collected in the previous study (lab setting, high-density 256-electrode EEG) and data collected by the low-density EEG in the present one. Second, the ISC data captured replicated the findings of the earlier study, namely, that strong health messages were deemed to be more effective because they enhanced inter-subject correlation. Third, the research demonstrated that it’s feasible to assess neural data in a group setting. Finally, even using low-density portable EEG, the regions of the brain impacted by strong messaging – commonly linked to personal relevance, the outward expression of feelings and emotion (affect), and attention – were the same as in the previous work. One thing differed between the previous study and this one: in this one, there were no significant changes in alcohol risk perception and behavior.
“This shows that an important signal is being received, one that goes beyond mere seeing and hearing,” said the study’s lead and co-corresponding author, Martin Imhof, from the University of Konstanz’s Department of Psychology. “We assume that what we are observing here is the audience engaging with the message of the videos.”
While the findings indicate that portable EEG could one day transform focus groups, there’s still a lot of work to be done. Although cheaper than the lab-based, high-density units, low-density EEG is still comparatively expensive – and complex. Once the setup is made simpler and cheaper, it could make health campaigns – or any marketing campaign, when you think about it – more effective.
“This is why we need to build on our proof-of-concept studies and consider how we can make these methods useful for healthcare organizations or agencies as they develop their campaigns, even without our technical resources,” Schupp said.
The study was published in the journal Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience.

Frontier Airlines is once again expanding its network at major U.S. airports.
This time, the Denver-based carrier is adding three routes:
TPG's picks:  The most-exciting new airline routes for 2025 
All three of the routes were previously operated by Frontier before the coronavirus pandemic, according to Cirium schedules, but this is the first time they will be flown since 2019.
Daily service from IAD to LAS kicks off May 1, and four-times-weekly flights from CLT to TPA take off just one day later. Frontier will operate weekly Saturday-only service from CVG to PUJ beginning May 17.
To coincide with the announcement, Frontier's introductory fares on these new routes start at $29. Note that Frontier's bare-bones business model means that you'll need to pay for extras like bags and seat assignments on the cheapest introductory fares.
For Frontier, this is the latest push into major U.S. airports, especially CLT and IAD. The former is the second-biggest hub for American Airlines, and the carrier already operates up to 10 daily flights in this market.
The nation's other big ultra-low-cost carrier, Spirit Airlines, also operates service in this market.
Meanwhile, IAD is a major hub for United Airlines, which offers up to four daily flights to LAS; Frontier will be the first discount carrier in this market.
With so much competition, it might initially surprise some travelers that Frontier is adding more routes from CLT and IAD. That said, while the airline has historically preferred to fly from secondary airports, Frontier has recently been busy growing its network at some of the biggest airports in the country.
This includes New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), where Frontier recently added three more routes, including a transcon to Los Angeles.
Major change:  Frontier Airlines announces first-class seats, companion pass for high-level elite status
It's usually cheaper for airlines to operate from smaller, secondary airports, which is one of the big reasons why Frontier (and its ultra-low-cost rivals) have historically preferred them.
But in recent quarters, Frontier's network strategy of focusing on secondary markets hasn't been working as well as it would like, leading to the airline upending its historical model to focus on bigger markets.
This network growth builds on Frontier's revamped commercial business model that includes up-front pricing on different bundles that include bags and seats, as well as the elimination of change and cancellation fees.
Frontier is even planning to add a domestic first-class-style recliner product later this year.

Deals Google Samsung

For the last couple of weeks, attention has been on the Samsung Galaxy S25 series as it went through pre-order and launch. Now that it has launched, let’s look at what else is out there. Google has been building up its market share and while it’s nowhere near Samsung’s level yet, its latest flagships present a serious challenge for the Galaxy line.
The Google Pixel 9 Pro XL couldn’t quite match the Galaxy S25 Ultra camera prowess in our head-to-head comparison, though the Galaxy didn't have a huge lead either. Also, the Pixel has things going for it, like ultra-wide selfies and a different (some might say better, others might not) take on Android. 
Even if the Pixel can’t beat the Galaxy on performance (and Snapdragon 8 Elite easily tops the Tensor G4), price might give the Pixel an edge – the Pro XL starts at $1,000 for a 256GB phone, the S25 Ultra starts at $1,300 (with a $200 gift card, but still).
The Google Pixel 9 Pro has the exact same camera setup as its XL sibling. So maybe it can’t beat the Ultra, but the Samsung Galaxy S25 has a fairly basic set of cameras – it lacks the 200MP main and the periscope of the Ultra. That makes for an easy win in a camera battle, but the Galaxy has the performance advantage.
The Pixel is also larger and heavier (199g vs. 162g), their batteries are evenly matched in terms of both endurance and charging speed. Unlike with the XL vs. Ultra, the Pixel 9 Pro and Galaxy S25 cost about the same, if you look at 256GB models: $900 and $860, respectively (the latter includes a $100 gift card).
Both companies have cheaper alternatives to their flagships. From Google that is the Pixel 9, which starts at $650 (for a 128GB phone). It’s similar to the Pro model but with a lower resolution non-LTPO display and no telephoto camera. You can find a more detailed comparison here.
Samsung’s budget offering is the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE. Interestingly, it uses an Exynos 2400e instead of a Snapdragon – this chip is a great performer for the price and is noticeably faster than the Tensor G4. This model does have a telephoto camera, an 8MP 75mm unit, but its ultra-wide is only 12MP (vs. 48MP on the Pixel 9).
Google also has the Pixel 8a, which now starts at $400. This is more of a mid-ranger, though, with the older Tensor G3 chip and slower charging (but both wired and wireless are available). A Pixel 9a has been rumored for a while now, it is expected to launch in late March.
Samsung and Google also have tablets, though only the Korean company has a variety of offerings. But the two we are looking at today are evenly matched – both cost $300 for a 128GB model and the 256GB variants are $10 apart.
Both are 10.9” tablets with IPS LCDs – 90Hz on the Galaxy compared to 60Hz on the Pixel, but the Pixel Tablet has a higher pixel density. Both displays support styluses. However, the Galaxy Tab S9 FE features DeX for multitasking, has a microSD slot and is rated IP68 for dust and water resistance (vs. no IP rating on the Pixel). The Galaxy also has a larger battery with faster charging (8,000mAh, 45W vs. 7,020mAh, 15W).
We may get a commission from qualifying sales.
Ugh… it’s always those two brands — always!
S24 FE 8/128 at $449 and 8/256 at $499 would be an even better deal.
OK so this Mediatek T900 should packs what's being integrated into D9400.

Samsung Apple Android iOS Versus

So, you are in the market for a powerful compact flagship phone, and you are ready to dig deep in your pocket for one of the world's heavy-hitters, the  Samsung Galaxy S25 and the Apple iPhone 16 Pro? In case, of course, you are not necessarily invested in either ecosystem.
Well, the two devices are very different when it comes to hardware, software and price. The only common ground they share is footprint. These are the latest and greatest compact premium solutions from Samsung and Apple, so it's only natural to put them head to head.
For starters, you can compare the complete specs sheets or directly continue with our editor's assessment  in the following text.
If portability is a top priority, then the Galaxy S25 is the clear answer here. Sure, it houses a slightly smaller display, 0.1"" smaller, but it's considerably more compact in real life. It's shorter, narrower and thinner, so it feels like a much smaller device in hand. Not to mention lighter.
The Galaxy S25 is more than 30 grams lighter than its competitor, and although that doesn't sound like much, it's a huge difference in hand.
Build quality-wise, the iPhone has a slight advantage since it features the latest and greatest Apple can offer (titanium frame and Ceramic Shield glass), while the Galaxy S25 is a step down from the S25 Ultra with an aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus  2. 
Ingress protection is matched at IP68, though Apple certifies their devices to withstand immersion at a much greater depth than Samsung (6m vs 1.5m).
Both devices offer excellent displays and are very similar in size too. However, the iPhone takes the lead with Dolby Vision support, slightly higher resolution (not that it matters much) and is also brighter. Don't get us wrong, the S25's panel is perfectly fine even in the brightest of days, but the iPhone 16 Pro's max brightness is hard to ignore - mid 1,700 nits vs. almost 1,400 nits.
Keep in mind the notch, though. Even though Apple uses it as a feature, it takes considerably more screen real estate than the punch-hole for the selfie cam on the S25. 
If we strictly look at the Active Use Score, one could argue the iPhone 16 Pro has only marginally better battery life. The Galaxy S25 even has a longer call runtime and slightly better gaming score, but the 16 Pro outperforms the S25 in web browsing/social network scrolling by a landslide while offering a slightly better video streaming score too, which are arguably the main two uses for modern-day smartphones.
Neither device has an impressive charging rate, and it's also hard to determine the winner here. According to our tests, the Galaxy S25 is the clear winner of the full charging cycle by outpacing the iPhone 16 Pro by around 21 minutes. 
Conversely, the iPhone 16 Pro beats the S25 to the first two checkpoints at 15 and 30 minutes by a few percentages. Still, we'd give the Galaxy S25 the win since it's meaningfully faster at the finish, while the iPhone is only negligibly quicker in the first 30 minutes.
The Galaxy S25 and the iPhone 16 Pro trade blows in this category, with the former winning in the loudness comparison and the latter by offering better tuning or sound quality, however you like to call it.
We find the iPhone 16 Pro's tuning warmer with more expressive bass, so tracks sound fuller and livelier.
The Galaxy S25 relies on Qualcomm's latest and greatest Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, with the ""for Galaxy"" designation suggesting slightly higher clocks on the main CPU cores and the GPU compared to the standard chipset used in other Android phones.
The iPhone 16 Pro, on the other hand, runs on an in-house designed chip, Apple A18 Pro, which historically has outperformed its competitors, but not this year.
Both devices offer 128GB of internal storage by default, which is pretty low for a high-end smartphone, but while the S25 can give you 512GB at best, the 16 Pro has a 1TB version. The 16 Pro's NVMe storage is notably faster than the S25's UFS 4.0 too. The 128GB version of the Galaxy also probably uses slower storage than that as UFS 4.0 is only available in sizes 256GB and up.
Notably, all iPhone 16 Pro configurations have 8GB of RAM, while the S25 runs on 12GB, no matter the storage.
As we pointed out earlier, Apple's silicon has historically been more powerful than its peers, but this year, Qualcomm outdid itself and introduced a significantly more powerful chip. The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy outperforms the A18 Pro in multi-core scenarios by 21%, at least in this particular comparison between the Galaxy S25 and the iPhone 16 Pro. In GPU-heavy workloads like 3DMark's Wild Life Extreme, the S25 beats the iPhone 16 Pro by around 38%.
The two devices feature very different camera hardware. Judging solely by the specs sheet, the iPhone 16 Pro is the clear winner here. It has a bigger main 48MP sensor, a 12MP telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom, and a more potent 48MP ultrawide camera.
The Galaxy S25 sits in the opposite corner with a 50MP main camera, 10MP telephoto shooter with 3x optical zoom and 12MP ultrawide snapper.
The selfie game of both handsets is very good - 12MP front-facing shooter with autofocus for the Galaxy S25 and 12MP selfie, autofocus-enabled unit for the iPhone 16 Pro.
Off to the actual camera comparison, we see a similar quality with a slight advantage of the iPhone 16 Pro. In almost all cases, the iPhone 16 Pro will give you sharper stills with a bit more detail and a wider dynamic range. This is true in both daylight and low-light scenarios. And that's even before you turn on the 24MP mode.






Galaxy S25: 0.6x • 1x • 2x • 3x • 5x






iPhone 16 Pro: 0.6x • 1x • 2x • 3x • 5x
The only case in which the S25 outperforms the iPhone 16 Pro is in the 3x zoom, which is to be expected given that the iPhone needs to crop from the main camera, while the Galaxy S25 has a dedicated 3x telephoto unit. On the other hand, the 16 Pro has a 5x camera, which produces nicer photos at its corresponding focal length. We were surprised by the Galaxy S25's ability to shoot in 5x, though, as it gets pretty close to the iPhone 16 Pro in daylight scenarios.






Galaxy S25: 0.6x • 1x • 2x • 3x • 5x






iPhone 16 Pro: 0.6x • 1x • 2x • 3x • 5x
Below, we have a few framegrabs from the videos taken by the two phones at each focal length so it's easier to compare to one another.






Galaxy S25 video framegrabs: 0.6x • 1x • 2x • 3x • 5x






iPhone 16 Pro video framegrabs: 0.6x • 1x • 2x • 3x • 5x
Video recording is where the iPhone 16 Pro excels. The 16 Pro delivers noticeably better videos night and day except for the ultrawide camera, where the two devices produce somewhat similar videos and in the 3x zoom mode, where the Galaxy S25 has an edge due to its physical zoom cam. 






Galaxy S25 video framegrabs: 0.6x • 1x • 2x • 3x • 5x






iPhone 16 Pro video framegrabs: 0.6x • 1x • 2x • 3x • 5x
The Galaxy S25 and the iPhone 16 Pro are definitely among the best compact flagship phones out there. However, the iPhone 16 Pro seems like the better phone overall, with its brighter display, better camera system, longer battery life and better-sounding speakers. But it's also the more expensive phone too. It sells for a little over €1,000 in Europe and $1,000 in the US, so it costs as much as a Galaxy S25+ (when you equate for storage), while the Galaxy S25 asks €800/$800. That's a 200 bucks difference, which can hardly go unnoticed.
In addition to the outlined advantages, the iPhone has UWB support, satellite messaging and a more premium build. These are not necessarily game-changer features, but some of you may appreciate them. It's also important to consider biometric security as the iPhone 16 Pro offers only Face ID, while the Galaxy S25 has an ultrasonic under-display fingerprint reader. We leave to you to decide which one is better.
On the other hand, the Galaxy S25 is lighter and more compact than the two, it's slightly faster to charge, packs more raw horsepower under the hood and is notably cheaper. And if you are into that AI stuff, you can enjoy most of the features on Samsung's One UI software right away, whereas Apple is yet to deliver all of its planned AI-powered features, let alone release them in Europe.
Why the Apple & Samsung Diss 🤧😂 (so funny) 
Generally I think both phones are good (I respect both) 
It's the users, always finding a way to fight 🤦🏽 
 
But for this comparison  
Shouldn't it had been the; 
S25 vs Ip16 
S25+ vs I...
Hello, man from the distant past. Unfortunately, Samsung still sucks.
Well, they still can't match Samsung's throttling at 40 percent processor, lame 8-bit displays, promises of new software only on paper, a camera that can't use in the dark, 5 caps stuck with superglue around the lenses, and fast chargi...

58,2025-02-16,"Passive Income Ideas For Entrepreneurs Who Want Financial Freedom
As an entrepreneur, you know how to put in the work to make money. But what if your money could work for you? That’s the power of passive income – earning money with minimal ongoing effort after you’ve set it up.
For many small business owners, your income is tied directly to how many hours you put in. If you stop working, the money stops flowing in. That puts you at risk as you are dependent on one source of income. But passive income changes the game by helping you diversify your revenue streams and creates financial security beyond your main business.
Creating and selling online courses is an effective way for entrepreneurs to generate passive income by leveraging your expertise. If you have specialized knowledge, you can package it into a digital course that sells repeatedly with minimal ongoing effort. There are platforms like Thinkific that make it easy to host, market, and sell courses without needing advanced tech skills. Using evergreen funnels, email marketing, and webinar promotions can help drive consistent enrolments and drive up your passive income earnings.
Writing and monetizing an e-book is a powerful way to generate passive income while establishing yourself as an authority in your field. You can use a self-publishing platform to reach a global audience without the need for a traditional publisher. To drive consistent sales, use lead magnets and nurture your audience with automated emails that encourage them to buy. With the right promotion strategy, an e-book can become a long-term, scalable source of passive income.
One of the easiest ways to generate passive income is to sell digital products. They only require upfront effort but can be sold repeatedly without additional work. Whether it’s templates, printables, stock photos, or digital planners, these products cater to a wide audience and can be sold on platforms like Etsy. Choose a niche with demand, price your products competitively, and leverage social marketing to drive consistent sales.
Investing in dividend stocks is a proven way to build consistent passive income while growing your wealth over time. Unlike stocks that only appreciate in value, dividend stocks pay out regular cash distributions to shareholders, making them a great source of recurring income. The real magic happens when you reinvest dividends and allow your earnings to compound over time. By strategically selecting and holding dividend-paying stocks, you can create a steady, low-maintenance income stream that works alongside your business efforts.
Investing in real estate is one of the most reliable ways to build long-term passive income and financial security. By purchasing rental properties, you can generate consistent monthly cash flow while benefiting from property appreciation over time. To truly make real estate passive, you can hire property managers to handle tenant screening, maintenance, and rent collection.
If you want to invest in real estate without the hassle of property ownership, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) offer excellent passive income opportunity. REITs are companies that own and manage income-generating real estate, such as apartment complexes. Investors can buy shares in a REIT just like stock, allowing you to earn dividends from rental income and benefit from property appreciation.
The bottom line is that building passive income isn’t just about making extra money; it’s about building financial security and long-term wealth that goes beyond your business. As an entrepreneur, your time is valuable, and relying solely on active income can limit your financial growth. By strategically implementing passive income ideas you can create sustainable revenue streams that support your business and lifestyle.

59,2025-02-16,"In context: AMD has firmly established itself as the leading CPU maker in the handheld gaming PC market, powering popular devices like the Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally X, and Lenovo Legion Go. At CES 2025, AMD further strengthened its position by unveiling new chips specifically designed for next-gen handheld gaming PCs, including the Z2, Z2 Go, and Z2 Extreme chipsets. Now, Intel is making strategic moves to challenge this dominance. 
Robert Hallock, Intel VP and GM of client AI and technical marketing, recently revealed the company's renewed focus on the handheld gaming PC market in an exclusive interview with Laptop Magazine. ""Intel is beefing up its staff to support gaming ISVs who want to do handhelds,"" the executive said.
This support extends beyond just providing hardware; Intel is implementing internal programs to help manufacturers optimize performance for handheld devices. The company has also assembled a team of handheld specialists to provide additional support for engineers and software developers.
A key aspect of Intel's strategy involves supplying game developers with early access to mobile gaming hardware. Since many developers typically focus on desktop environments, Intel aims to broaden their perspective.
A lot of game devs tend just to target what they have on their desks or in their QA labs, Hallock noted. To address this, Intel plans to supply developers with prototype devices and dev kits leading into the launch of Panther Lake.
Also see: The History of Handheld Gaming PCs

At CES, Intel showcased a range of upcoming products featuring its chipsets, including the MSI Claw 8 AI+ and Tencent Sunday Dragon 3D handhelds. However, Hallock noted that some unidentified devices on display were powered by Intel's latest Arrow Lake-H SoC.
Hallock pointed out that Arrow Lake-H offers graphics performance comparable to Lunar Lake and that some of these handhelds now operate at up to 30 watts. He also emphasized that Arrow Lake is well-suited to the gaming handheld form factor.
Intel's roadmap extends beyond Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake, as the company is already preparing for its next-generation mobile chips, codenamed Panther Lake. Unlike Lunar Lake, which features on-package memory, Panther Lake will allow for greater customization.
That feature is welcomed by handheld vendors as they are able to customize the memory they put in the platform, Hallock said. At the same time, he added, Intel offers other technologies that can compensate for the removal of the memory on package, which saves power.
As an additional part of Intel's push into the handheld gaming market, it is actively seeking partnerships with game developers to optimize software for handheld devices. Hallock extended an open invitation: ""If there's a game developer out there who happens upon this article eventually and you've been thinking about handhelds, give us an e-mail. We would love to work with you and help you optimize your software for handheld devices.""

60,2025-02-16,"Lewis Altfest was one of the earliest fee-only advisors when he founded his family firm in 1983. These days he is serving his clients distressed houses, REITs and bitcoin. 
Andrew (left), Karen (center) and Lewis Altfest (right).
Most financial advisors today are bound by the so-called fiduciary standard. They typically work on a flat fee or percentage of assets fee and are required to work in their clients’ best interests. Some four decades ago, this wasn't the case. Sales commissions drove the financial advice landscape and many brokers recommended whichever suitable product gave them the highest fee, regardless of whether it was the best deal for the client.
Lewis Altfest was one of the first advisors embracing the fee-only “fiduciary” model, co-founding L.J. Altfest & Co in 1983 after leaving money manager Lord Abbett & Co., where he was director of research.
“People said that you can't make money in fee-only financial planning,” Altfest, 84, recalls.
Under the name Altfest Personal Wealth Management, the octogenarian manages some $1.7 billion in assets today as CEO, though it is now a family affair: Altfest’s wife, Karen, and eldest son Andrew, 44, work alongside him as executive vice-president and president, respectively. His wife joined him at Altfest Personal Wealth Management in 1987, starting out by helping around the office before getting her designations and becoming an advisor in her own right. Much of her work today revolves around advising women clients and educating them on financial wellbeing through various events, with a particular specialization in widowhood planning.
Son, Andrew, grew up around the business: He recalls that from a young age, he was often overhearing discussions about financial planning from the backseat of the car, for instance. He started as an intern when he was 14-years-old and later joined the firm full time after college.
The Altfests and team cover roughly 600 households, with a special focus on healthcare professionals like dentists and physicians, who make up the largest client segment. “We are not a big brokerage house where you go into a glass box and sit with somebody,” says Karen Altfest. “Our clients want to hear about our grandchildren and want to tell us about their grandchildren.”
While Altfest Personal Wealth Management has traditionally focused on a mix of stocks and bonds in client portfolios, alternatives have increasingly become popular. On the equities side, the firm originally started with mutual funds only, but have since added individual stocks and active managers as well.
“We’re still active in purchasing individual municipal bonds for clients,” says son Andrew Altfest. “We have also been investing in alternatives in the last few years, in part because we didn’t think bonds were that attractive.”
Lately Altfest, like many other advisors, has been emphasizing alternative investments by buying publicly traded real estate companies like American Tower, Public Storage, Crown Castle and Avalonbay Communities. The firm has also recently added Bitcoin to its offerings in order to meet growing demand, buying bitcoin for clients through an ETF, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC). Another area of interest is infrastructure investments such as utilities, materials and railroad companies. “Infrastructure is more defensive in nature: Their income streams are more stable, less cyclical and so they have embedded inflation protection in their prices,” says Andrew Altfest, who likes the Lazard Global Listed Infrastructure Fund (GLIFX), which is hedged against the U.S. dollar. He adds that utilities are particularly attractive given increasing power demand from households and data centers; One example is Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU).
The firm’s latest thematic play to find value, spearheaded by Andrew, is in distressed real estate. Altfest started buying houses out of foreclosure for as low as $3,000 to $5,000 using his personal money when he first started incubating the strategy. The firm purchases land parcels or single-family homes in places like Allentown, Pennsylvania, then fixes them up and makes necessary repairs to make them livable again. Today, most purchases are made for less than $100,000 with the team investing in multiple markets including the northeast, midwest and the south. “Distressed single-family homes are our biggest focus, but we also buy land parcels and sometimes new construction,” says Andrew Alftest.
The firm first started this offering with a seed fund in 2019 before officially launching a first fund in 2021. The second launched in 2023 and the third is planned for this year. So far it has been one of the strongest strategies in the firm’s portfolio. 10% of the 40 people at the firm are now solely dedicated to real estate investing for clients.
Going into 2025, the Altfests are cautiously optimistic about stock market returns, especially after the two previous years of S&P 500 returns exceeding 20% (far above the historical annual average return of 6% to 7%). They predict single-digit returns are likely this year, noting that corporate earnings have remained strong but economic risks like President Trump’s tariffs remain.
“Tariffs will be implemented and are meant to fund the intended reduction in taxes,” says Altfest. “However, they will be materially lower than advertised and more selective by country.”
He says he has seen it all when it comes to market cycles but notes that current high valuations leave little margin for error, however: “At today’s price-to-earnings multiples, we may get another year of the market rally, but if anything goes wrong, there will be plenty of downside.” What’s more, he is telling clients to expect some volatility in the short-term as Trump’s back-and-forth decisions add uncertainty to the market.
As for the Federal Reserve, Altfest expects the central bank to hold back on additional interest rate cuts for now. “The Fed will stand pat, possibly with a small reduction in rates as long as inflation doesn’t turn up materially,” he says. “Early signs are that the inflationary impact will be less than expected.”

Even if you’re a budget gamer and don’t want to splurge over $500 on a gaming monitor, you still deserve a large display that delivers an immersive experience. This is where the LG 27GS50F-B UltraGear Gaming Monitor comes in—it has a regular price of $169.99, which is already pretty cheap when it comes to gaming monitors. But at the moment, it’s currently on sale for 24% off on Amazon, bringing it down to $129.99. This is also its lowest price to date, so those on the market for a new bigger screen should jump on this deal.
This monitor comes with a massive 27-inch display and the usual goodies expected from a gaming display. It has a 180Hz refresh rate and a 5ms GtG response time, helping give you a sharp and crisp experience no matter how hectic the action on your screen gets. It features AMD FreeSync technology and is HDR10 compatible, allowing you to get incredible visuals without breaking the bank. And if you’re into FPS games, this monitor has a built-in Crosshair feature, giving you an advantage over your opponents.
LG 27GS50F-B UltraGear Gaming Monitor: now at $129.99 on Amazon (was $169.99)This budget gaming monitor gives you a 27-inch screen with a Full HD resolution. It also delivers a 180Hz refresh rate and a 5ms GtG response time.
The LG 27GS50F-B monitor also features thin bezels across the sides and at the top, with LG calling it a virtually borderless design to give your desktop a sleek modern look. It also has three input video ports—two HDMI and one DisplayPort—and a 3.5 mm jack audio output port. This makes attaching multiple devices, like your gaming PC, gaming console, and handheld console dock, more convenient, removing the need to frequently attach and reattach your cables.
It is missing out some premium features, like an OLED screen, 4K resolution, or 100% DCI-P3 coverage, but you don’t really need these to have a great time with your favorite titles. What’s more important is you can tilt the screen between -5 to +15 degrees to give you the optimal viewing angle. And if that isn’t enough for you, it has a 100 x 100 mm mount, allowing you to put it on a monitor arm for more comfortable gaming.
LG did not say how long this sale price will last on Amazon, but it’s already out of stock on the LG U.S. website. So, if this is exactly what you’re looking for—a cheap gaming monitor that doesn’t skimp on the most important features—then you better get your hands on it right now.

For years, investors who've done the least have performed the best.

        Despite their best efforts, fund managers broadly have consistently trailed the market. Only 30% of actively managed global funds beat their indexes in 2024, according to Bank of America.
    

        US-based managers weren't much better. BofA found that 36% of active large-cap mutual funds in the US exceeded their benchmarks last year, in line with the long-term average of 37%. The last time a majority of large-cap funds outperformed was in 2007, right before the financial crisis.
    

        Ironically, those figures seem to suggest that effort is negatively correlated with portfolio returns. To add insult to injury, active managers also often charge lofty fees. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has risen at least 9.5% in all 12 of its up years since 2007, and is on pace to again this year.
    

        Investors have responded accordingly. Passive investing has taken off, as low-cost index funds have steadily taken market share and are now more prevalent than their active counterparts. BofA found there's a staggering $22.5 trillion in assets across passive ETFs and mutual funds.
    

        ""Passive indices have been gaining market share versus active managers for decades, at this point,"" Jeff Schulze, ClearBridge Investments' head of economic and market strategy, said in an interview. ""Higher fees, a lot of times, have not justified outperformance for active managers.""
    

        But there's a problem: when everyone pours money into index funds tracking the same stocks, valuations for those companies become inflated — thereby reducing expected future returns.
    

        Put another way, passive investing is usually the best strategy, unless everyone in markets is following it at once. And that's exactly what several market veterans say is happening.
    

        ""We are in a passive bubble right now,"" John Creekmur, the investment chief at the eponymous Creekmur Wealth Advisors in Illinois, said in a recent interview.
    

        Passive index funds have become a ""self-fulfilling prophecy,"" Creekmur said. US workers are saving for retirement at record rates, investment giant Vanguard said last year, and they're often choosing from a handful of target-dated funds that include those that track indexes like the S&P 500.
    

        The passive boom means that trillions of dollars are flowing into a few hundred stocks. By extension, the S&P 500's valuation has surged to a lofty 22.5x earnings, which Creekmur thinks is red-flag territory. And the Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, a widely followed metric that tracks inflation-adjusted S&P 500 profits over 10-year spans, is right at its second-highest level ever.
    

        This dynamic has given a disproportionately big boost to the mega-cap growth firms that have long led the market. These Magnificent Seven stocks, as they're often called, have become richly valued as they've ballooned to a strikingly large one-third share of the S&P 500. On a related note, BofA noted the technology, communication services, and consumer discretionary sectors make up over half of the index, which is an unprecedented rate for the market's hottest stocks, dating back at least 60 years.
    

        Arguably the main reason active funds haven't kept up with their passive peers, at least in recent years, is that they have had far less exposure to these mega-cap growth leaders.
    

        However, most market observers agree that such narrow leadership isn't sustainable long term.
    

        ""History suggests that a reversion to the mean will eventually occur, with the average stock outperforming in the coming years,"" Schulze said. ""So we think that this is a very ripe environment for active managers to be able to claw back some of that relative performance.""
    

        Although US stock valuations are elevated, that has been the case for years. There's always a risk that these warnings about passive investing going too far could be another false alarm.
    

        ""I don't think passive investing is in a bubble,"" Christian Chan, the chief investment officer at AssetMark, told Business Insider via email. ""Investors are getting more discerning about what they are willing to pay for, and I believe they are still willing to pay for services/products that offer value.""
    

        Besides, active and passive strategies don't have to be mutually exclusive, as Chan noted. By necessity, one approach will outperform the other at a given time, though investors can build balanced portfolios using both index funds and mutual funds, even though the latter has lagged.
    

        ""I do think we're at a critical crossroads where, yes, passive indices will give you lower fees, but I think that active managers have a very strong opportunity to provide alpha or outperformance versus the index,"" Schulze said.
    

        Naturally, portfolio manager Brian Recht concurs with that assessment — and is about to put his convictions to the test. In early February, Recht and colleague Nick Schommer launched the Janus Henderson Transformational Growth ETF (JXX), which aims to invest in 20 to 30 stocks with clear competitive edges and potential to be the next Magnificent-Seven style behemoths.
    

        The thesis Recht is testing may not pay off unless earnings growth broadens from mega caps to smaller growth stocks and the rest of the market. Many on Wall Street have expected that gap to narrow for years, and if they're right in 2025, fund managers like Recht will be well-positioned.
    

        ""We're seeing record levels of concentration in many indexes,"" Recht said in a recent interview. ""So if we were to see the largest weights in the index underperform — and active management tends to be underweight those names — it would be an aggregate tailwind.""
    

        There are several ways the purported mega-cap bubble could pop, Schulze said, including an unwinding of the AI-driven rally. Chinese AI startup DeepSeek's shockingly capable chatbot called into question whether tech giants will keep plowing money into pricey AI chips. It looks like they will, though those bets will backfire. Tariffs could be another headache, as Schulze said mega caps are especially at risk since they generate more than half of their money overseas.
    

        As much as investors want to buy low and sell high, many just follow the crowd or go off their emotions or gut instinct. That may mean they'll stick with passive, mega cap-heavy strategies until they start to underperform — at which point, everyone in markets should look out below.
    

        ""Typically, there's an event that triggers,"" Creekmur said. ""Once the trigger happens, there's the initial little bit of shock. It's like, 'Oh, my goodness.' And then after that happens, you start to see more people selling out. Then it gets to the point where we do have a domino effect starting to go.""

The offering comprised 26,450,000 shares of common stock priced at $22.00 per share. Karman itself issued 8,421,053 of these shares, while existing stockholders (""Selling Stockholders"") sold 14,578,947 shares. Additionally, certain Selling Stockholders provided 3,450,000 shares as part of the over-allotment option exercised in full by underwriters. Karman will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the Selling Stockholders.

Proceeds from the IPO that Karman receives, combined with its current cash reserves, will support general corporate initiatives, including further development efforts, working capital, and operating expenses.

This IPO represents a significant milestone for Karman, marking the culmination of years of growth and strategic positioning within the defense and space industries. The company has steadily expanded its portfolio, focusing on advanced technologies for missile defense, hypersonic vehicles, and next-generation space platforms. Karman's ability to secure major government and commercial contracts has cemented its reputation as a key player in an increasingly competitive sector.

The decision to go public follows a series of successful project completions and technological advancements. Over the past year, Karman has increased its production capabilities, streamlined its supply chain, and invested heavily in research and development to stay ahead of market demands. These efforts have not only improved operational efficiency but also positioned the company for sustained long-term growth.

Looking ahead, Karman aims to leverage the proceeds from its IPO to accelerate innovation, expand production facilities, and explore strategic partnerships that will further enhance its market presence. The company is particularly focused on strengthening its role in the rapidly evolving space defense sector, where new opportunities are emerging due to increased government spending and private sector investment.

Leading financial institutions managed the offering. Citigroup and Evercore ISI acted as book-running managers and representatives of the underwriters. RBC Capital Markets and William Blair also served as joint bookrunners, while Baird took on the role of co-manager.

As Karman embarks on its next phase as a publicly traded entity, industry analysts are closely watching how the company executes its growth strategies and adapts to the dynamic landscape of space and defense technology.

Proceeds from the IPO that Karman receives, combined with its current cash reserves, will support general corporate initiatives, including further development efforts, working capital, and operating expenses.

This IPO represents a significant milestone for Karman, marking the culmination of years of growth and strategic positioning within the defense and space industries. The company has steadily expanded its portfolio, focusing on advanced technologies for missile defense, hypersonic vehicles, and next-generation space platforms. Karman's ability to secure major government and commercial contracts has cemented its reputation as a key player in an increasingly competitive sector.

The decision to go public follows a series of successful project completions and technological advancements. Over the past year, Karman has increased its production capabilities, streamlined its supply chain, and invested heavily in research and development to stay ahead of market demands. These efforts have not only improved operational efficiency but also positioned the company for sustained long-term growth.

Looking ahead, Karman aims to leverage the proceeds from its IPO to accelerate innovation, expand production facilities, and explore strategic partnerships that will further enhance its market presence. The company is particularly focused on strengthening its role in the rapidly evolving space defense sector, where new opportunities are emerging due to increased government spending and private sector investment.

Leading financial institutions managed the offering. Citigroup and Evercore ISI acted as book-running managers and representatives of the underwriters. RBC Capital Markets and William Blair also served as joint bookrunners, while Baird took on the role of co-manager.

As Karman embarks on its next phase as a publicly traded entity, industry analysts are closely watching how the company executes its growth strategies and adapts to the dynamic landscape of space and defense technology.

	The Super Bowl might be over (and not the most satisfying), but, this Sunday we get the Stock Car Super Bowl: The 2025 Daytona 500. The premier NASCAR event sees 45 racers on Florida’s Daytona International Speedway chasing the Harley J. Earl Trophy.


	If you’re looking to watch the 2025 Daytona 500 today, read on. Below is a full guide on the best ways to livestream the NASCAR race without cable, plus key details about the big race.

	The 2025 Daytona 500 airs live on FOX. If you don’t have cable, you’ll want to get a live TV streaming service to watch the Daytona 500 online. Below are some of the best options that carry FOX — most of which offer free trials.











		DirecTV Stream essentially gets you a cable package without the physical gear, contracts, or other fluff. You get a five-day free trial to start, and every plan includes FOX (where available) for streaming the Daytona 500 today. After the free trial, plans start at $49.99 a month for a limited time.	









		Another great comprehensive live TV streaming service is Fubo, which also carries FOX for a Daytona 500 livestream. Check it out for free for seven days here. Plans start at $84.99 a month after that.	









		Hulu + Live TV is great because you can bundle over 95 live channels, ESPN+, Disney+, and Hulu (on-demand). These bundles start at $82.99 a month and you can grab a three-day free trial to start.	









		A more affordable cable streaming option is Sling, which offers plans starting at $45.99 a month. Plus, you get 50% off your first month’s bill. You’ll need the Sling Blue plan to get FOX streams of the Daytona 500.	

	The 2025 Daytona 500 is happening today, Sunday, Feb. 16. FOX coverage starts at 2:30 p.m. ET and the flag wave is scheduled for 3:11 p.m. ET.



	One of the Daytona 500’s draws is how hard it is to predict. However, of the 45 drivers, there are a few standouts to watch. Kyle Busch is currently the favorite (+1100), according to oddsmakers, despite never winning the race in his 19 seasons. Denny Hamlin (+1200), Ryan Blaney (+1200), Joey Logano (+1300), Chase Elliott (+1300), and Brad Keselowski (+1400) and Kyle Larson round out the top contenders.

76,2025-02-16,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), often referred to as “the Dow,” is one of the most widely recognized stock market indices in the world. It serves as a barometer for the overall health of the U.S. stock market and, by extension, the broader economy. This article provides a detailed overview of the DJIA, its history, composition, calculation, significance, and its role in global finance. By the end of this guide, you’ll have a thorough understanding of why the DJIA is a cornerstone of financial markets.

The DJIA is a price-weighted index that tracks the performance of 30 large, publicly-owned companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges. These companies are leaders in their respective industries and are considered blue-chip stocks, representing a significant portion of the U.S. economy. The index is maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices, a joint venture between S&P Global, CME Group, and News Corp.
Unlike other indices like the S&P 500 or Nasdaq Composite, which are weighted by market capitalization, the DJIA is weighted by the price of its constituent stocks. This means that higher-priced stocks have a greater influence on the index’s movements.
The DJIA was created in 1896 by Charles Dow, co-founder of Dow Jones & Company, and his business partner, Edward Jones. Initially, the index included just 12 companies, primarily from industrial sectors such as railroads, cotton, gas, and sugar. The goal was to provide a simple way to gauge the performance of the U.S. stock market.
Over time, the index evolved to reflect changes in the economy. By 1928, the DJIA expanded to include 30 companies, a number that remains unchanged today. The composition of the index has also shifted to include companies from a broader range of industries, such as technology, healthcare, and consumer goods.
The DJIA is a price-weighted index, meaning that stocks with higher prices have a greater impact on the index’s value. The formula for calculating the DJIA is:
DJIA=∑(Prices of the 30 Stocks)DivisorDJIA=Divisor∑(Prices of the 30 Stocks)​
The divisor is a number that adjusts for stock splits, dividends, and other corporate actions to ensure the index remains consistent over time. The divisor is periodically updated to maintain the index’s continuity.
For example, if the combined price of the 30 stocks is $5,000 and the divisor is 0.15, the DJIA would be calculated as:
DJIA=50000.15=33,333.33DJIA=0.155000​=33,333.33
The DJIA includes 30 companies that are leaders in their industries. These companies are selected by the Averages Committee, which considers factors such as market capitalization, reputation, and sector representation. Some of the well-known companies in the DJIA include:
The index is periodically updated to reflect changes in the economy. For example, in 2020, Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell were added to the index, replacing ExxonMobil, Pfizer, and Raytheon Technologies.
The DJIA is often used as a proxy for the overall health of the U.S. economy. When the index rises, it is generally interpreted as a sign of economic growth and investor confidence. Conversely, a declining DJIA may indicate economic uncertainty or recession.
The DJIA is closely watched by investors, analysts, and policymakers. Movements in the index can influence investor sentiment and drive market trends.
As one of the oldest stock market indices, the DJIA provides a historical benchmark for comparing current market performance to past trends.
While the DJIA focuses on U.S. companies, its performance has a global impact. Many international investors use the index as a gauge for U.S. market conditions.
The S&P 500 includes 500 companies and is weighted by market capitalization, making it a more comprehensive representation of the U.S. stock market.
The Nasdaq Composite focuses on technology and growth-oriented companies, with over 3,000 constituents. It is also market-cap weighted.
The Russell 2000 tracks small-cap companies, providing insight into the performance of smaller businesses.
Investors can gain exposure to the DJIA through:
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) remains one of the most influential and widely followed stock market indices in the world. Despite its limitations, it provides valuable insights into the performance of the U.S. economy and serves as a key benchmark for investors. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a beginner, understanding the DJIA is essential for navigating the complexities of the financial markets.

78,2025-02-16,"House prices in a county where the council has introduced measures to crack down on second homes have fallen by more than 12% year-on-year, according to new figures.
The local authority in Gwynedd, north-west Wales, recently introduced a requirement to obtain planning permission to turn residential properties into second homes or holiday lets. 
It is also one of a number of Welsh councils which charges a 150% council tax premium on such properties, having upped this from 100% in 2023. 
The council, Cyngor Gwynedd, said its aim was to ""increase the availability of high-quality, affordable homes for local people"".
The fall in value represents the biggest annual drop of any region in the Principality Building Society's Wales House Price Index, covering residential property sales in the final three months of 2024. 
The average house price in Wales has remained broadly flat year-on-year and is now £233,194, according to the building society. 
Tom Williams and his family, who live in Lancashire, are struggling to sell the second home they own in Morfa Nefyn, Gwynedd.
""I have four grandchildren who had a wonderful time there every summer and it's been great, we've loved it,"" said Mr Williams, who has owned the house for 20 years.
Mr Williams and his wife put the house on the market in April 2024 but said they had had little interest from potential buyers, despite dropping the price by £40,000.
""I put it down to all the other properties in the village that are up for sale at the moment,"" he said.
Mr Williams believes some of the interventions by the council have prompted a lot of people to sell, while also putting off potential buyers.
Cyngor Gwynedd has been trying to address the shortage of housing for local people in tourist areas and has more than doubled the council tax charge on second and holiday homes.
The council also recently introduced Article 4, which requires property owners to obtain planning permission to turn residential homes into second or holiday homes.
""I've spoken to a lot of families who have had homes there for generations and they're saying the same thing - how can we carry on with this?"" said Mr Williams.
North Wales estate agent Dafydd Hardy described the housing market in Gwynedd as ""mixed"", with local interventions on second homes leading to ""more properties coming on to the market"". 
But he said the price of a second home was often ""outside the affordability of the local purchaser"".
""What we need to see is balance in the market,"" he said, including ""more house building as far as first-time buyers are concerned"".
The new figures are based on seasonally-adjusted data from the Land Registry, but a lot of different factors can affect the picture that data ends up painting.
Factors such as interest rates, regional job opportunities, interventions in the local housing market by a council and even the number of transactions can all have an impact on house prices.
It means there is some uncertainty about what caused the drop in prices in Gwynedd in the year to December.
Pembrokeshire saw the second biggest annual fall in prices at 8.9%. 
The council there recently voted to reduce the council tax premium on second homes from 200% to 150%.
By comparison, Carmarthenshire saw the biggest year-on-year increase in house prices at 9.2%. 
The council there is introducing a council tax premium of 100% on second homes from April. 
Iain Mansfield of the Principality Building Society said the housing market across Wales had shown ""resilience"" over the past 12 months. 
Sales were up by 28% year-on-year, which Mr Mansfield said demonstrated ""greater consumer confidence"" with lower interest rates making mortgages more affordable.
""I think we're seeing a more positive outlook for those people who want to buy a house in 2025,"" said Mr Mansfield.
Mr Mansfield said the ""sizeable"" drop in prices in Gwynedd over the past year was reflected in ""some of the other coastal areas in Wales"".
He said the drop could ""potentially"" be explained by ""some of the interventions that have been made in the area around second home ownership"".
Cyngor Gwynedd said ""over 65% of Gwynedd's population was priced out of the housing market"" and tackling the housing shortage was a ""key priority"".
It said it introduced Article 4 to ""gain better control over the existing housing stock"" and they were ""continuously monitoring its effects"".
It added some of the money raised by the council tax premium was used to enable ""the development of new homes, the creation of supported accommodation for those facing homelessness and grants and loans to help local people secure housing, amongst many other projects"".
The Doll's House in Porthleven was once known as the Box and Heater because of its shape.
Criminals pretending to be bailiffs are tricking people into paying thousands of pounds to settle fictitious debts.
Companies cannot bill customers for gas and electricity used more than a year ago, but not everyone is aware.
Help to fix unsuitable insulation under government schemes only applies to work done since 2022.
Karen Bray says demand for housing is so high she has to live in a flat that is unsuitable for her.

When Google launched the latest Pixel series last year, there was a murmur of excitement around the smartphones’ names. Google had revived the XL moniker for the Pixel 9 Pro XL, a suffix not seen since the Pixel 4 lineup. The fact this caused even a minor stir tells you a lot about the state of the iOS and Android phone industry.
Phone naming conventions in recent years are tedious, and it bothers me. Max, Plus, Pro, and Ultra have been so overused that they’re all but meaningless — if they ever offered much meaning in the first place.
There’s little point in complaining. Big brands know as well as I do how dull and repetitive the names are, but you can be sure that market research is behind the continuity in device names. People know the score if the upcoming smartphone has the same series of names as the last one. They already know what the next Samsung or Apple phones will be called, and they’re safe in that knowledge — well, aside from that Galaxy S25 Edge curveball. The manufacturers are welcome to take advantage of this and perhaps maximize revenue, but I’ll still see them as boring and uninspired.
Smartphone names might seem like a small thing to get irked about, but they bother me because they optimize the industry overall. The refusal to take a risk with more interesting names reflects a lack of imagination or a fear of being bold in the market, and you can see it in almost every aspect of modern flagships.
This won’t have escaped your notice. With the exception of foldables, the design of most flagship smartphones is depressingly similar. It might be optimal for use, but I can’t help but think that selling the next-gen smartphone to fans could be easier if it doesn’t look identical to its predecessor.
The same goes for features. Where are the IR blasters, modular accessories, or pop-up cameras? What about new and innovative features? We know where all these things are; they’re on the design room floor, having been rejected in favor of making the next handset half a millimeter thinner, just like its counterparts.
You’ll find the same nod to conformity in every element of flagship phones. The brands don’t even exhibit much more variation in the color department — The Samsung Galaxy S25 colors are tediously similar — but at least the names of the colors are relatively interesting sometimes. Colors like Sage, Onyx, and Sapphire would make better names for the actual devices than the same old labels.
While humdrum naming conventions seem to be on the rise, there is some resistance to the trend. Some phones still have marginally more interesting monikers, especially when you look past Samsung, Apple, and Google. The OnePlus Nord breaks the mold slightly, and Motorola has more variety, if not imagination, with the G Play, G Power, G Stylus, and so on. Some of the Chinese brands are also a bit more ambitious, with names like the realme GT Neo and the Nubia REDMAGIC.
Even the biggest players have dabbled with naming excitement in the past. Samsung has had the Galaxy Beam, Galaxy Alpha, and the Samsung Omnia. Google took a risk with the Nexus. Apple hasn’t even strayed that far from convention, but at least the iPhone 17 Air will be a little different if it appears later this year.
We also know that humdrum and repetitive names aren’t necessary for success in the tech world. For instance, Garmin is one of the biggest players in the smartwatch industry. Its wearable names include Quantix, Fenix, Forerunner, and Instinct. Phone makers should take note.
For any multi-national smartphone manufacturers still reading, I’m more than happy to offer my own name suggestions for your next generation of handsets. And I’m doing it free of charge — no marketing budget needed, just pick one from the list.
I want names that sound cool and evoke feelings of speed or power. It’s also useful if a series of names hints at which phones have higher or lower specs, too, as being able to identify this may be part of the reason Apple goes with Pro Max and Samsung goes with Ultra each year. We’ll also want to avoid certain words — a Google Pixel Earthquake or OnePlus Tornado could be problematic if a natural disaster occurs.
In Greek mythology, Helios was the titan of the sun, riding his blazing chariot across the sky each day. He’s a natural starting point for an entry-level device — powerful but not quite a god. Apollo takes things further, embodying light, knowledge, and artistry. But at the peak stands Zeus, the undisputed ruler of Olympus, commanding thunder and dominion over gods and mortals alike. All of these would be great for Apple’s pride and dreams of grandeur — and for its fans’ self-esteem.
Mythical beasts would be ideal phone names for OnePlus, implying a sense of power and cutting-edge tech. The Chimera was a wild fusion of creatures — a lion, a snake, and a goat — symbolizing unpredictability and raw potential. The Griffin, part lion and part eagle, was a noble guardian, combining strength and wisdom. The Phoenix is a legendary bird that bursts into flames only to be reborn and more powerful. LG even used this name for a phone range a few years ago.
Celestial forces make so much sense for Samsung’s Galaxy line. A Meteor is a swift and fleeting streak of fire across the sky. The Comet is more enduring, returning on predictable cycles (like a phone) and burning brighter with each pass. And then there’s the Supernova, a cosmic explosion of unimaginable power that leaves a lasting impact on the universe.
Looking at a phone’s development as a journey, it begins with an Origin base model from which everything grows. Evolution is the process of refining, strengthening, and adapting; then comes the Apex, which is the peak and the culmination of all progress. I like these names for the Pixel family, especially now that it’s reaching its 10-year anniversary.
And if the rumors are true and the entire Pixel family is switching to an in-house chip, then maybe Vortex is the right name, pointing to a powerful and transformative process in Google’s line-up.
This would be a fairly naked attempt to project the flow of power, which sits well with Motorola’s motto. A spark is a flicker of energy and the first moment of ignition, which would make sense for an entry-level device. The Pulse follows, carrying that energy forward. Then comes the Surge of unstoppable power from the premium flagship.
If that’s all a bit highbrow, Xiami could tap into popular culture with smartphone names derived from three of the most common emojis. The entry-level wink teases the potential of the lineup, and the Kiss is something everyone likes to receive. The Joy — derived from the face with tears of joy emoji —  reflects maximum happiness for the top-tier device.
If you have any unique phone naming suggestions of your own, no matter how whacky, feel free to leave them in the comments below."

Herms employees are cashing in on the company's success.

        On Friday, Herms presented its 2024 financial report that showed better-than-expected sales. (Business Insider converted the euros to dollars based on currency rates as of Friday.)
    

        The French luxury group said that sales reached 4 billion euros ($4.1 billion) during the fourth quarter, an 18% increase at constant and current exchange rates. Additionally, Herms earned 15.2 billion euros ($15.9 billion) in revenue last year.
    

        In response, Herms employees are getting a 4,500 euro ($4,723) bonus. There are more than 25,000 staffers currently at Herms.
    

        ""True to its commitment as a responsible employer and its willingness to share the fruits of growth with all those who contribute to it daily, Herms will be giving out a bonus of 4,500 to all its employees worldwide at the beginning of the year in respect of 2024,"" the report said.
    

        Herms has made a habit of gifting year-end bonuses to its employees, but the amount has steadily increased over the last five years. The company offered a 1,250 euro ($1,312) bonus following its 2020 financial results, then handed out a 3,000 euro ($3,148) bonus the following year.
    

        The bonus was bumped to 4,000 euros ($4,198) following the company's 2022 and 2023 financial results.
    

        ""In 2024, in a more uncertain economic and geopolitical context, the solid performance of the results attests to the strength of the Herms model and the agility of the house's teams, whom I thank warmly,"" Axel Dumas, executive chairman of Herms, said in a statement on Friday.
    

        The company's financial results are a bright stop in the luxury industry, where some companies struggled to navigate a market slump in 2024. Share prices for LVMH, Burberry, and Kering all dropped last year.
    

        Would-be luxury shoppers in China cut back on spending amid an economic crisis, while inflation prompted many Americans to avoid pricey luxury goods. In Europe, uncertainty surrounding politics led shoppers to hesitate.
    

        ""50 million luxury consumers have either opted out of the luxury goods market or been forced out of it in the last two years,"" Claudia D'Arpizio of consulting firm Bain & Company said in a November report.
    

        Representatives for Herms did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider that was made outside regular business hours.

UPDATE: Super busy weekend at the international box office with Marvel/Disney’s Captain America: Brave New World and Universal/Working Title’s Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy both making their debuts while Chinese blockbuster Ne Zha 2 keeps zooming along — and also hit North America this session.

Captain America came in pretty much bang on worldwide projections with $192.4M (including domestic’s holiday Monday estimate). Of that, $92.4M is from 52 overseas markets through Sunday. The international bow is under the $110M we saw as a possibility before the weekend, though as cautioned, that included the swing market of China where Brave New World faced massive competition from Ne Zha 2.

	Anthony Mackie’s first full feature adventure carrying the shield opened No. 1 or No. 1 non-local in nearly all major markets as well as most smaller markets. The most significant market not at No. 1 was the UK where Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy is having a love affair with audiences.




			Watch on Deadline		






	Overall, Brave New World’s international opening is 4% ahead of Captain America: The Winter Soldier in like-for-like markets at current rates (and excluding China).

	The Top 5 opening markets are: China ($10.5M), UK ($8.5M), Mexico ($6.6M), Korea ($5.6M) and France ($4.7M).

	The Imax global opening was $18M including Monday’s domestic holiday.

	While it’s a straight-to-Peacock release domestically, Universal/Working Title’s Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy has audiences reuniting with the romcom heroine in theaters internationally. Uni released the fourquel in 70 overseas markets this weekend to $32.3M. Including Studiocanal’s France release, the full debut this session is $35.5M.

	The launch was the biggest for a Bridget Jones title in like-for-like UPI markets (and the biggest opening of the franchise in 41 markets including the UK & Ireland, Poland, Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland). 

	What’s more, at current rates, Mad About the Boy achieved the biggest romcom opening of all time in like-for-like UPI markets, beating Sex and the City 2.

	The UK was positively chuffed to see Renée Zellweger return to the titular role, grossing an estimated $14.8M at No. 1 and with 45% market share. This was the biggest bow ever for a romantic comedy (a record previously held by Bridget Jones 2) as well as the highest ever opening for a Working Title film. Mad About the Boy is the No.11 Universal opening of all time in the market, just behind Jurassic World Dominion and above the debut frames of Oppenheimer, Minions and Despicable Me 3.  

	










	In Australia, the cume through Sunday is $3.4M, in 2nd place behind fellow newcomer Captain America: Brave New World. This reps the biggest opening for a romcom since the start of the pandemic, overtaking Anyone But You, and is also above Bridget Jones 1 and Bridget Jones 3. Reviews are excellent, with a 100% approval from critics to date.

Poland opened to $2.2M at a clear No.1 and good for the biggest romcom start ever. Bridget 4 also already surpassed the total lifetimes of Ticket to Paradise, Me Before You and Sex and The City 2. Rounding out the Top 5, the Netherlands’ Ladies Night previews on Wednesday fed into a $1.9M weekend for the best romcom start ever. Spain placed Mad About the Boy at No.2 this weekend, with $1M. Future Universal markets still to release include Italy and Germany this month and Japan and Korea in April.

	Studiocanal’s Paddington in Peru, which journeyed to North America this weekend, added $7.3M overseas in the frame to lift the offshore cume to $115.8M, of which $21.6M is from Sony markets. The global total is $128.8M through Sunday. Still ahead are Korea, Italy, Spain and Japan. 

	In China, Ne Zha 2 is still the top draw, reaching RMB 11.84B through Sunday ($1.63B). It’s the No. 11 film ever worldwide with just the China cume, but also opened in North America to $7.2M. Maoyan has revised its lifetime projection for China slightly downwards, to RMB 15.7B ($2.16B) which, if it gets there, would still make it the No. 5 movie ever globally.

	In Imax, Ne Zha 2 is now the format’s highest grossing title ever in China with $104M, overtaking Avengers: Endgame.

Earnings season is nearing the finish line, with over three-quarters of the fourth-quarter earnings season complete. The pace of earnings releases eases to 45 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. 76% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. Only one of the Magnificent 7, NVIDIA (NVDA), is left to release earnings on February 26. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA).
S&P 500 Earnings Season
The S&P 500 rose 1.5% for the week, with the Magnificent 7 outperforming with a 2.1% gain. Markets were pleasantly surprised with President Trump’s announcement that ordered a study of reciprocal tariffs rather than an immediate implementation.
Market Returns
According to FactSet data, multiple sectors drove the improvement in the earnings growth rate for the week.
The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by communications services and consumer discretionary. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost twenty-eight percent decline in year-over-year earnings.
4Q 2024 Estimated Earnings By Sector
Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. Expected sales growth was unchanged for the week at 5.2% but exceeding expectations at the start of earnings season, with the tailwind from 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth.
4Q 2024 Sales Estimates By Sector
Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for financials, communication services, and consumer discretionary, the blended earnings performance has significantly outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +16.9% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter.
S&P 500 Earnings Summary
Consumer inflation (CPI) came in hot for January, rising to a 3% year-over-year rate. Used cars, airfares, and auto insurance premiums were a large part of the story behind the numbers. Inflation has recently accelerated, with the 3-month annualized rate at 4.9%. Help from some of the volatile components and housing inflation should help it ease somewhat from here.
U.S. Consumer Inflation: CPI
Despite an ugly month-over-month gain for services inflation, excluding housing, the year-over-year rate declined to 4%. If services inflation continues to improve, markets and the Federal Reserve will rest easier about inflation fears.
Services Inflation
While December retail sales were revised higher, January data exhibited evidence of a broad-based spending hangover from the robust spending data at the end of last year. In addition, natural disasters may have weighed on spending. As long as U.S. employment continues to rise, consumer spending should snap back.
Consumer Spending & Jobs
Sluggish consumer spending caused the Atlanta Federal Reserve to cut its estimate of first-quarter GDP growth to 2.3%. This is nowhere near recessionary levels, but it is down from the robust growth estimate of 2.9% before the retail sales release.
On a more positive note, the easing in economic growth estimates helped bring 10-year U.S. Treasury note yields down from higher levels following the hotter-than-expected consumer inflation reading.
10-Year U.S. Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition
Without as much meaningful economic data this week and most of it impacted by natural disasters, the Federal Reserve meeting minutes on Wednesday could provide some clues to the timing of the next rate cut. The Fed is expected to be on the sidelines until at least mid-year when it might resume short-term interest rate cuts.
Number Of Expected Rate Cuts
Earnings season continues during the holiday-shortened week, but the pace of releases has begun to slow. Given President Trump’s feverish pace of policy announcements, markets will continue to be on guard, although market participants seem to be adapting to the new administration as is typical. The highlight of the week should be Berkshire Hathaway’s earnings and Warren Buffett’s highly anticipated annual letter on Saturday. This follows the release of the details of Berkshire Hathaway’s publicly traded stock portfolio last Friday. Buffett seems to have continued to reduce Berkshire’s allocation to stocks, but he added one new company to its stable of holdings.

When Android 15 landed with Private Space in tow, everyone — me included — winked at their screen and nodded, knowing exactly what that new feature would be used for. I won’t delve into your or my private business; that’s not exactly my jam. But when I activated Private Space on my Pixel 9 Pro (it’s a Pixel exclusive for now), I realized that it’s a very powerful and unique addition to my Android phone that enables me to do things I couldn’t before.
With time, I’ve come across five different use cases for Private Space that make it essential for me because of security, privacy, distraction management, or convenience. If you’re not familiar with the feature, check out how to activate and use Private Space, and then follow me as I explain how I personally use it.
If my Android phone falls into the hands of a thief, especially if they manage to snatch it from me when it’s unlocked or if they somehow steal my PIN code, I don’t want them to have access to my most sensitive apps. Hiding financial apps under Private Space, and making sure Private Space itself is hidden too, adds one more layer of security. This ensures that thieves or nosy people either don’t see these apps at all or aren’t able to access them because they’re locked behind a different PIN code. (Google has a disclaimer about malicious apps or adb being able to detect private apps, but I still think it’s worth it for being one more layer to deter petty thieves.)
I do leave one banking app in the main app drawer, though — usually the one with the smallest account and no credit card access. That’s usually my day-to-day account. The other apps often live in my Private Space, though I’ve had to make peace with the fact that I never receive any notifications from them because of the feature’s limitation. That’s usually fine, except for French banking apps, which always require me to validate any online payment by going through the app and agreeing. Since I don’t get any notifications, I have to manually unlock Private Space, open the app, and then agree to the payment pop-up, but that’s a small price to pay for extra security.
I’ve also tried putting the apps for my smart lock and security system in Private Space to stop anyone from opening my front door or disarming my alarm, but the problem is that I do definitely rely on getting notifications from these apps. A workaround would be to create two users with different permissions — one visible in my app drawer with limited powers and one hidden in Private Space with admin privileges — but I haven’t been able to dial in those permissions exactly to my liking. So for now, these apps remain in my main app list.
I also attempted to hide 1Password, my password manager, to keep any passwords away from prying eyes, but I noticed that I heavily rely on it as an autofill solution and I can’t use that if it’s locked in private. Manually checking login details every time was very inconvenient. I know that using two different password managers would circumvent that, but it’s a very overkill solution for me, for now.
Notifications aren’t the only thing that Private Space stops. The feature essentially sandboxes and quarantines apps in a separate environment with no access to my contacts, calendar, files, photos, or anything else on my phone. And that’s absolutely perfect when I want to use an app that I don’t completely trust.
Sometimes it’s an app from a developer I don’t know, sometimes it’s a random app I’m briefly testing and want to delete later, and sometimes, it’s just Twitter X. No matter the reason, if there’s an app I’m not so sure about or want to keep away from the rest of my phone, then Private Space is where I’ll install it. That way I know that I’m giving it less room to roam and less data to siphon by default. Plus, when Private Space is locked, potentially problematic apps can’t perform any background actions, use any of my phone’s sensors, or track me across other apps. Private Space keeps them off and offline, and I love that.
I have four Google accounts, three of which I use daily (personal, work, and shared with my husband). The fourth one is an old shared account that my husband and I created on a trip to Austria when we were still living in Lebanon. It was meant to help us get access to Google features and apps that were available in the EU but not on a Lebanese account. Since then, we’ve moved to France and created a shared French account, so this fourth account is not longer essential. But it still has a thing or two that we care about and that we weren’t able to migrate or were too lazy to migrate.
Since I rarely use this account, I don’t want it installed on my phone, littering every account picker and account switcher menu. I just want access to some things a few times a year. Previously, I accessed it from the browser sometimes or added it to my phone then remove it, but not anymore. Now, that’s the account I associate with my Private Space account and I can just let it be, untouched, for weeks on end, then when I need to check it, I just unlock Private Space and open Gmail, Chrome, Keep, or Maps to check it out.
If I could quarantine all of my apps, I would, but for now, Instagram and Threads would have to do. Keeping them locked away means I’m not tempted to open them when I see that icon in my app drawer. With no notifications and no background updates, they have no way to disturb me, either.
I’ve tried putting a time restriction on apps with Digital Wellbeing, but that didn’t do much, and I always ended up unpausing the app once the timer hit. With Private Space, I find that I’m less inclined to open the app because it’s hidden away from my eyes. Out of sight, out of mind, as the proverb says.
There are a million and one reasons for why you’d need to have two instances of the same app, and the sad part is that stock Android doesn’t allow this when other skins offer it. With Private Space, though, we have a workaround that lets us create a second and independent instance of an app on a Pixel phone.
I find this is very useful in apps that don’t allow me to have multiple accounts logged in at the same time. Amazon, for example, requires a multi-step process to let me switch from my French account to my US, German, Spanish, or Italian ones. And since some items are sometimes heavily discounted in other countries but not in France, I just want quick access to those countries’ stores without messing with my main account. That’s why I use a secondary instance of Amazon to check prices and order items from other countries.
I also have two Spotify accounts in different locales that are useful when I come across geo-restricted music. Instead of logging out and in again, I can just check my second account, see if it’s available there, then decide if it’s worth going through any extra hoops to listen to that music or not. It’s a very restricted use case, but it’s come in handy once or twice.
There are also other apps where I have both a personal account and a joint one with my husband. Booking.com, GetYourGuide, ChatGPT, and Uber are some of the ones that come to mind, and being able to have both accounts logged in on the same phone is a time-saver.
This is where my journey with Private Space ends for now. I know that for many, it’s a convenient way to hide their dirtiest secrets, but I really appreciate the feature for its immense potential. I just hope to see it come to stock Android and stop being a Pixel-exclusive feature."

The Blue Jays have signed left-hander Amir Garrett to a minor league deal, according to Johnny Giunta of the Gate 14 Podcast.  Garrett will earn a guarantee in the “low seven figures” if he makes Toronto’s active roster, Sportsnet’s Ben Nicholson-Smith writes.  Garrett has been on the open market since last August, when he was released by the Angels.
A veteran of eight MLB seasons, Garrett tossed a career-low 5 1/3 innings in the Show in 2024, as he spent the majority of the season with the Angels’ Triple-A affiliate.  The southpaw inked a minors deal with the Giants a year ago but was released near the end of Spring Training, and then quickly caught on with Los Angeles on another minor league contract just prior to Opening Day.  Selected to the Angels’ active roster at the end of April, Garrett had a 5.06 ERA in his brief stint in Anaheim before he was designated for assignment and released in mid-May, only to soon rejoin the Angels on another minors deal.
Control problems have long plagued Garrett’s career, but he kept the walks in check along enough to deliver some good results out of the Reds’ bullpen during the 2018-20 seasons.  It seemed like the former top prospect had carved out a niche for himself as a reliever, but things then went sideways, as Garrett has posted a 5.06 ERA and 15.7% walk rate over 122 2/3 innings since Opening Day 2021.
Garrett’s mid-90’s velocity and strikeout potential is still apparent, as he also has a 27.2% strikeout rate in his last four seasons of big league work.  But, his walk rates have only continued to increase, and Garrett has also had trouble keeping the ball in the park.  The lefty’s minor league numbers weren’t too promising, as he had a 5.08 ERA in 33 2/3 innings with Triple-A Salt Lake in 2024, though with at least a better (10.6%) walk rate and a strong 28.5K%.
Garrett turns 33 in May, so it remains to be seen if he can truly harness his control at this later stage in his career.  If he can limit his walks to even a passable number, the Blue Jays can certainly use such a pitcher in their bullpen mix, particularly since Brendon Little is the only southpaw projected to be part of the relief corps.  Easton Lucas, Josh Walker, and another minor league signing in Richard Lovelady are also in Toronto’s camp battling for a potential bullpen spot if the Jays opt to break camp with a second left-handed reliever.

The Red Sox were first linked to Dylan Cease’s market back in early December, before Boston acquired Garrett Crochet from the White Sox and signed free agent Walker Buehler.  These moves brought some needed reinforcement to Boston’s rotation, but the team’s interest in Cease continues to at least linger, as MassLive.com’s Sean McAdam reports that the Sox “have been in touch with the” Padres about Cease’s availability.
A source indicated to McAdam that Boston’s interest is more of the “due diligence” variety, and could simply be due to the fact that Cease’s trade market might not be fully closed until San Diego actually moves the right-hander elsewhere.  There is also no guarantee that Cease will be dealt whatsoever, as reports from earlier this week suggested that the Padres were more apt to keep both Cease and Michael King (another pending free agent) to keep their own rotation strong.
Speculatively speaking, moving Cease to the Red Sox wouldn’t necessarily create a hole in the Padres’ rotation, just because it would seem likely that the Sox would send a starter-capable pitcher back in return.  The Red Sox already have enough pitchers on hand that a six-man rotation isn’t out of the question, so this volume alone would suggest that at least one of those hurlers would be dealt to the Padres in exchange for Cease.
Crochet, Buehler, Brayan Bello, and Tanner Houck wouldn’t be doing anywhere, and Lucas Giolito’s salary and recent injury history would likely keep him off the Padres’ radar.  Beyond those pitchers, any of Kutter Crawford, Quinn Priester, or Richard Fitts could work as part of a trade package, fitting in nearer the back of San Diego’s rotation behind the top three of King, Yu Darvish, and former Red Sox righty Nick Pivetta.
It would take more than just a single young starter to pry Cease away from the Padres, of course.  As McAdam notes, the Red Sox would have to factor how much they’d be willing to give up for a rental pitcher like Cease, particularly when the club has already significantly dipped into its farm system to swing the Crochet trade.  Crochet was a different situation altogether, as he is arbitration-controlled for two seasons and is making only $3.8MM in 2025, plus the left-hander has already expressed some interest in signing a contract extension.  Cease is making $13.75MM in his final year before free agency, and like most Boras Corporation clients, is more likely to test the open market than explore an extension to remain with the Padres, Red Sox, or whatever team Cease might be playing for by season’s end.
The shorter-term benefit of adding Cease is obvious for a Red Sox club that seems intent on returning to contention.  Cease could slide right in as Boston’s No. 1 starter, bumping everyone down a step and lengthening the team’s rotation.  Since Alex Bregman could opt out of his new contract as early as next winter, the Sox might be viewing 2025 with particular “win now” urgency, and acquiring Cease would certainly help in quickly getting Boston back into the playoff race.
Salary-wise, the Red Sox are projected (as per RosterResource) for an approximate $241.6MM luxury tax number this season, putting the team just a touch over the $241MM tax threshold.  Bringing Cease’s salary on board would put the Sox more firmly into tax territory, which is perhaps notable since the traditionally high-spending Red Sox have crossed the tax line just once in the last five years.  Again, Boston’s renewed focus on contending might not make a one-year tax hit a big deal in the eyes of ownership, especially since even without adding Cease, it stands to reason the Sox will look to make some kind of in-season add at the deadline if the club is indeed competing for a postseason spot.

Abreu is a platoon RF. A 4th OF once Anthony is called up. Yoshida is a platoon DH with no power. No team would be willing to take on Yoshida and $55.8 million when he can’t throw a ball or hit live pitching yet. 
We are not getting rid of our backups and trash  for a top of the rotation starter. It’s going to take giving up players with real value to the Padres. You know what they asked for in December. What makes you think they would want less now?

Yoshida’s “value” is to a team trying to meet MLBPA payroll minimums.
Any other real trade value will be attached. Red Sox have the prospect pool to offer that but they look more likely to utilize that nearer to the trade deadline if the opportunity/need is there.

Padres are not the Dodgers, Yankees, Red Sox etc.
They are a smaller market team that borders
on Mexico to the south, the Pacific Ocean to the West, the Cleveland National Park, mountains and desert to the east and Orange Country (Angels) and LA Dodgers to the North.
The Padres have to be creative if they want to be David to the Goliath like the Dodgers in the AL West.
With a  hard floor and a salary cap for MLB,
this kind of creative financing and player drafting, trading, signing, trading will continue into the foreseeable future.
The Padres are selling out most games and drawing over 3 million fans a season.
The local TV provider went bankrupt last year and MLB TV stepped in to handle their TV
Attendance and MLB national TV contracts make up most of their revenues.
To stay competitive with the Dodgers without spending 300M and running deficits,
creative financing, trading for players that will keep the Padres playoffs competitive and will not walk with no player  compensation when free agency is looming is part of that process.
They have to keep fan interest and keep those turnstiles turning and the cash rolling in
to keep it going or they would be looking at fire sales and tear downs of the team.

Trading Soto was very smart.
It cut payroll and filled a lot of holes  especially in ithe starting rotation.
Padres won more games (93) without Soto than with Soto.
It would have been smarter to never trade for Soto in the 1st place since all the young  rising stars they gave to the Nats would plug most of the current holes on the Padres for less money and more years of club control.

Abreu, Crawford & Miguel Bleis for Cease.
Abreu would start for SD and fans will love him for his defense and hard nosed play. Crawford is a solid, established #4 or #5 starter and Bleis is a wild card. He is the Sox #6 ranked prospect who could either become a star, or he may never make it to the majors. This seems like a decent package for 1 year of Cease.
There’s no way Boston is giving up Anthony, Campbell or Mayer for 1 year of Cease.

RSFL, No. Preller wanted more for Cease at the Winter Meetings and that price has not gone down. 
Yoshida would mean increasing the number of players and prospects the Red Sox send back to the Padres. He would not get a It will take the Red Sox paying $40 million of his remaining deal just as a salary dump with no good players going back to the Red Sox.  If he was a free agent no one would pay him more than $5 million and there is no way he would get more than 1 year unless the 2nd year was as a team or mutual option. 
So the answer is no. 
Do you really want to know what it would take to get Cease?  First, go look at Jon Paul Morosi on MLB Network during the Winter Meetings back in December.  At that time Preller wanted Mayer, Abreu, Fitts, and Gonzalez. Then go find the articles about what he has asked the Orioles, Cubs, and Mets for in return for Cease. ALL of the asks by Preller included a top 30-50 prospect that is MLB ready (Mayer, Sproats, Shaw, Mayo/Bassalo), 2 SP that are in the majors or MLB ready, and a MLB position player.
Cease is not available and the Padres have made that clear by what they have asked for in trade. If teams want him, they have to meet what Preller is asking for because the Padres have no reason to lower their asking price. 
So go back and re-do your trade proposal with those facts in mind. 
If you are including Yoshida in your trade proposal, include $40 million and increase the number of players coming back to the Padres.  
Thanks for attending my Ted Talk.

With Cease the Padres ar four deep in their rotation.

Hear me out…BoSox get both Cease and King from the Padres and vault to the top of the AL pennant contenders (maximizing the recent Bregman signing) while the Pads still stay in contention in the NL West and/or a wild card spot. BoSox would have to give up Anthony, 3 other nearly MLB ready, top 100, stud prospects that include a left fielder and (potential 3-5) youthful starting pitcher or two + a 1-2 year bridge catcher (until Salas is ready for the Pads) along with a current 3-4 starting pitcher. Essentially…a two starting pitchers for 6 players deal. BoSox maximize their contention window and the Padres prolong theirs.

I’m always puzzled seeing so many Padre fans act like there’s no way Cease will be traded. AJ Preller and Jerry Dipoto have to be the two most likely GM’s to make a trade every year. Last year pad fans were fighting everyone in the comment section on how Preller would never move Soto. Plus the name of this site literally has “trade rumors” in it.
Im not saying Cease will definitely get moved, but I wouldn’t ever bet against Preller pulling the trigger on an expiring deal.

@Murray. It’s not that a Cease trade is viewed as not possible by Padre fans, it’s that there’s been roughly 20 articles suggesting there’s a rumor, when no new news is actually being reported. Did you click on the link to MassLive.com? I did. The GM of the Padres, like every GM in MLB, is always willing to listen to offers on players, especially those with just one year left on their contract. But that fact alone is not newsworthy IMO.
And if Cease is traded now it would go against everything the Padres front office has actually said publicly to the contrary.  But if you enjoy click bait for the mere sake of it, that’s fine too.

It’s called mlb trade rumors. What do you expect? Most of us come here for this specific type of content. AJ loves to make trades more than almost every other GM in baseball. 
Also your comments are still up under all the old Soto/Padre articles. You’re the commenter who was swearing up and down that Soto wouldn’t be moved. You were wrong then and I wouldn’t be surprised if you’re wrong about Cease too. People need to remind you more often so you learn a little humility and common sense.

“they’ll extend Soto, sign Nola and Snell, and Eguy leads the league in hitting.”
If you go back further pads fans were even worse, insulting everyone and laughing at these unfounded rumors.
I understand we all overrate our own guys but Brew even pointed out none of the Yankees prospects were top 100 outside Dominguez and how the pads would never do a Soto trade without top 100’s included. Just a few months later Soto was moved and a few months after that Thorpe hit top 100 lists. 
My point is SD fans need to relax, zoom out and let their GM cook. Especially when many of you guys were wrong about generational talent Soto not getting moved because he just bought a house in SD, etc.

John Seidler is not now the Padres control person or Chairman. That position is held by Eric Kutsenda and will be until the lawsuit is settled. As of today and for the foreseeable future absolutely nothing has changed in the Padres executive offices. 
All of what has happened is exactly what Kutsenda and Greupner have been saying since before Matt Seidler tried to name John Seidler control person or the lawsuit was filed.
They said that the Padres would have a payroll somewhere between 2023 and 2024 which is where they are now, that they have the payroll flexibility to add any player or players that are a fit which they have done, and that the level of payroll we would see in 2025 is sustainable.  
John has never been involved with the Padres. He did not show up at Peter’s memorial at Petco and he has only been seen at Petco once or twice in the entire time the Seidler/.O’Malley clan has been part of the ownership group. He has not shown up at Fan Fest in any year including 2025.

They did have a choice. The one they made was to get 4 MLB players and a TOP 100 prospect that they traded for a TOR starter.  
The Padres outlook is that they dipped under the CBT last season and now have the #6 payroll in MLB. A payroll level that the Chairman and the CEO have said is sustainable for them. Only one team has increased payroll more than the Padres and its not the Mets. 
The ownership and control of the team is stable. It will be until the lawsuit is settled.

Burns FIP is 3.21 compared to Cease which 3.69. Better WHIP, walked less significantly better  ERA too (3.19 vs 3.69). Lastly Burns has been significantly better in the Post season as well. Bottom line Burns has been the better more consistent pitcher vs Cease. I like Cease but he’s not at Burns level. There are plenty of other indicators besides b war to show that Burns is the better pitcher.

Hey, you are the one that brought up WAR as an example of Burnes’ superiority. When it was revealed that Cease actually has the edge, you changed to “that’s not the only stat that matters.”
You also said K/9 so you were wrong 2/4. Batting .500 in baseball terms but in the real world being wrong half the time isn’t such a feat.

Yes because burns war is better. you keep harping on the B war like it’s the only stat that matters. I was wrong about the K/9 I can admitted I mis read that but the other stats are accurate. Also it wasn’t 4 stats it was many more than that that show Burns is better. . you provided one which isn’t exactly a lot to support your point. 
Providing addition evidence to support your point isn’t moving the goalposts.

No. Burns and Cease are very similar pitchers.
And, the price on young top of the rotation starters has gone up since last year if you haven’t noticed that fact.

In the real world, you have to pay market rate or higher for Cy Young competitive #1 starters or you don’t get them.

No Burns and cease aren’t as similar as you’re making it out to be. Burns has clearly been the better pitcher to date and has been more accomplished and more consistent pitcher than Cease. 
tin arms of trades he price has gone up for players that are younger than cease, have more years before free agency, and aren’t as expensive. Perhaps you should be more aware of that fact.

I don’t think he gets moved this ST, but if he does, it will be for a haul. The Red Sox don’t seem like the team that needs to pay that haul. They have a strong SP rotation already.

Red Sox aren’t trying to move Casas unless they get a young pitcher with upside.  I really doubt they trade him straight up for Cease.  
They are trying to move Masa that’s the only reason they would consider moving four years of control of Casas for one year of Cease.  The Red Sox are similar to the Padres they are only moving Casas if they can attach Masa.  They aren’t moving him for less than that.  
The reality is Cease will probably get moved at the deadline so will King if they are out of the hunt.  At this point I don’t see the Red Sox moving Casas either he is the first baseman.  This might change if Devers gets a bunch of reps at first and looks really good, which I think is doubtful.  Nothing to see here San Diego isn’t trading Cease and Boston isn’t trading Casas.

Sometimes I think people forget that having a 6’4 big dude at first base with soft hands helps every infielder knowing they can let it loose and he has a huge catch radius and can pick balls out of the dirt if needed.   
This concept of moving Devers to first instead of DH is preposterous.
No way do Story and Bregman and whoever you put at second base want Devers playing first.  And no chance Red Sox play Devers over Bregman at 3rd base.  
Story and Bregman give you really good range on the left side and outstanding defense if they stay healthy.  This helps pitchers in a Huge way for anyone that understands a pitchers mindset.  It allows them to attack the inside part of the plate with confidence.  People keep telling Ortiz to talk to Devers and tell him to be happy being a DH.  It should be Pedro explaining to the young kid what a huge difference it makes for the pitching staff to be dominant on the inside third of the plate.

Baseball – With all due respect, Yoshida has absolutely demolished the ball for at least half a season in each of his two years with the Red Sox. 
Twice he has gone more than 3 months with an OPS of over .900
April 20th-Aug 19th, 2024 he batted .325 with a .901 OPS
April 18th-Jul 25th, 2023 he batted .339 with a .927 OPS
In both years it was only health issues that prevented him from having a .900+ OPS full season.
Geez, I wonder why Japanese players such as Yamamoto and Roki don’t even want to meet with the Red Sox when searching for a team. Yeah I’m sure all the baseless Yoshida-hate has nothing to do with it, right?

Baseballisthebest 
7 hours ago
We play full seasons. Staying healthy is a skill Yoshi doesn’t have and his most recent injury is one that most players don’t return to form for years after having that surgery.  Because of his lack of hitting, his lack of power, his lack ability to play defense and his proclivity for getting injured, Yoshi has no value in trade.  Many writers including Dierkes and Adams on this site and our own Chris Cotillo have spoken about the fact that he would not command a muti-year deal if he was a free agent and likely would get only a 1/5 deal.
Took a look. Yoshi didn’t have a single month at .900 in 2024 and only one in 2023 and those were sandwiched by really bad months in 500s and 600s.

Buehler isn’t a guarantee but everyone knows it’s year 2 after the TJS come back you want.  Buehler looked like he was putting it together in the end of the playoffs as with many TJS comeback stories it’s about control which Buehler looked like he was getting it back toward the end of season. Injuries are always an increased risk with pitchers. A like Buehler who was a young dominant Ace prior to injury with the comeback story in health last year and a normal off season after pitching roughly 90 innings last season (with roughly the same velocity avg. FB 95 opposed to 96 when he was 25 y/o and 95.5 in his best season at 27) I think Buehler may be the steal of the offseason.
Crotchet pitched 146 innings last season if you call 180-200 an inning limit… I call that an easily manageable full season.
This Cease trade doesn’t happen at least not early season. RS will never sell any of their top 3 or so prospects for a 1 year rental on Cease.

Houck would never be moved on any 1 year rental. 
Crawford you wouldn’t want right now, he’s been battling knee issues that, depending who you believe, either he wasn’t letting on were as bad as they are, or, the team mismanaged and delayed aggressive treatment. I vote for the former. Anyways, he probably won’t be starting the season, and, if he has issues that require surgery, you’re talking even longer. 
Red sox are light on pitching and pitching prospects. It’d be hard to pry much loose, I wouldnt see more than one arm parting ways unless it was a guy who profiled as nothing more than middle relief.
Right now they’ve got a lot of mlb guys on the last year of multi year deals coming back from injuries, probably most about to exit as FA. But long term pitching they’re in short supply and likely to try holding onto.

Baseballisthebest 
7 hours ago
Jsay, we know that won’t happen for multiple reasons.  When Breslow reached out in December  their GM asked for a package that included Mayer, Abreu, Fitts and another SP prospect we already traded for Crochet. 
Yoshi is a liability in trade. He is a DH only who has little power and can’t hit LHP. Think about it this way.  What kind of contract would he get if he was a free agent? 1/5? 1/6 maybe? That is the most we can expect other teams to take on of his contract. With Henry eating $12-13 million per year, including Yoshi in any trade still means we have to send more players to the other team.

93,2025-02-16,"Argentina's President Javier Milei is facing impeachment threats after endorsing a cryptocurrency called LIBRA, purportedly intended to support small businesses, which instead crashed and lost billions of dollars in value within hours, according to Reuters.
In a now-deleted late Friday post on X, Milei promoted LIBRA as a privately run project designed to raise money for small and medium-sized Argentinian companies, adding that he doesn't stand to reap personal gain from the project.
The token rapidly surged to a market capitalization of about $4.5 billion amid confusion over the legitimacy of Milei's tweet, with speculation that his account may have been compromised or that scammers had deceived him.
Milei deleted the post five hours later, saying  that he was “not aware of the details of the project"" and, now informed, has chosen not to continue promoting it.
The market then panicked, with insiders cashing out $87.4 million worth of tokens, according to data sources Kobeissi Letter and Bubblemaps. The token's market cap crashed 90%, erasing over $4 billion in market cap.
The country's fintech chamber said  the LIBRA case could potentially be a “rug pull,"" in which developers abandon a project after taking in cash from the initial sale.
""This scandal, which embarrasses us on an international scale, requires us to launch an impeachment request against the president,” lawmaker Leandro Santoro, a member of the Argentine opposition coalition, said Saturday, according to Reuters.

The difficulty was, it put so much coin and effort into the solution, it created a whole new problem: the ludicrous price of a portable propane fire capable of delivering useful warmth (that's this baby). With its second product, Howl looks to find a more practical mix of performance and cost. The all-new R1 fire pit is much cheaper, more compact and manages to spit out a flame nearly high enough to singe your beard hairs. 
As much as we related to the idea of a warmer propane fire, we really worried for the future of a company whose first and only product was a $1,299 portable fire pit. Sure, overlanders, hunters and other outdoorsy types like to spend money, and many of them have plenty to spend. And sure, the Solo Stove and others like it have proven there's a very nice market for premium portable fire ware. But $1,300 is multiple times more expensive than other portable fire pits and tests one's wildest imaginings of just how much the market will pay. 
The all-new R1 expands Howl's target market in a big way. At $349, it's priced much more in line with the competition, and if big, flickering flames are your thing, it might just be the best value available. 
When we first spotted the R1, we assumed it was a smaller, more wallet-friendly version of the R4. Sadly, though, it doesn't offer the R4's red-hot-metal radiation trickery and comes with no claims of rivaling a wood fire in terms of heat. It won't. In fact, it's based on the very type of simple, heat-shedding propane-fueled flame Howl created the R4 to outperform. 
But if you were buying any other propane fire pit for a fifth or so of the R4's price, you weren't getting that infrared warmth, either. And the R1 offers a couple of intriguing advantages over the price-point competition. Most crucially, it uses an open chassis that lets the flame rise straight up and out, instead of keeping it contained inside a bowl or box the way other portable LPG designs such as the Ignik FireCan do. The 160 holes on the comprehensive burner system all feed in small flames to combine into the tall, powerful fire that surges upward out of the grille. 
Not only does this layout create a more mesmerizing fiery display, it eliminates the need to crank the output to max just so you can see the fire peek over the edge of the bowl. Howl's flame always rises up out of the chassis so you can enjoy the experience while using less propane. ""Every bit of fuel you burn becomes light you can use,"" the company summarizes.
Of course, if you want to crank it up to 11, you can get that powerful skinny triangle of a flame to rise up to 32 inches (81 cm) high. Howl estimates a burn time of eight hours per 20-lb tank when going full blast or days on end when dialing it back. 
While propane fire pits are less likely to spark a wildfire than wood fires, and are allowed under several US forest burn restrictions that ban some or all wood campfires, we do wonder what happens when someone accidentally knocks that 32-in fire sideways. We suppose so long as you have a good radius of clear dirt or rock around, without any duff, debris, branches or brush within flame's length, it shouldn't spark a wildfire before someone picks it up. Still, we'd be a bit more worried about something that high than a more contained unit, in terms of potentially igniting a big, out-of-control fire or possibly burning a person. 
That said, the R1 looks to be a low-set, stable design much less likely to tip over than something like the Tripod Torch. If anything, burning your own leg would be more of a worry than knocking the whole unit on its side. 
When it's time to break camp, the R1's legs fold in and the total package measures 13.3 x 8.4 x 6 inches (34 x 21 x 15 cm). Howl compares it to the size of a shoebox, which checks out when we're talking men's shoes. That small size is aimed at easier packing within a truck bed or SUV trunk already overstuffed with days' worth of camping and travel gear. The R1 can also strap right to the propane tank, whether it's being carried inside or outside the vehicle (strap not included). At 11 lb (5 kg), it's a breeze to carry and about a third the weight of the R4. 
Howl hammers the R1 out with the same style of durable, hard travel-ready construction as the R4. It uses a hydraulic brake press to bend the 304 stainless steel into shape and puts the entire shebang together at its Colorado factory. 
Howl launched the R1 earlier this month and says it's been pulling in orders ever since. Lead time is already out to mid-June, so if you want one of these for Summer 2025, Howl suggests putting that order in ASAP.
