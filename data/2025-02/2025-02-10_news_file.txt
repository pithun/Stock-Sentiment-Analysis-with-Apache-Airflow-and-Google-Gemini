We recently published a list of 10 Best Widow and Orphan Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) stands against other best widow and orphan stocks to invest in.
Investing in the stock market can be a prudent strategy for widows and orphans seeking financial stability and growth. Widow-and-orphan stocks are typically associated with established companies in sectors like utilities and consumer staples. These companies often provide consistent dividend payments, offering a reliable income stream. This stability is particularly valuable during economic downturns, as these stocks tend to exhibit lower volatility compared to high-growth equities. Investing in stable, dividend-paying stocks can aid in preserving and growing wealth over time. The combination of regular dividend income and potential capital appreciation makes these stocks suitable for individuals aiming for sustainable financial growth without excessive risk exposure.

A study published in July 2024 highlights the critical role of financial literacy in investment decisions and stock market participation. The research indicates that increased financial knowledge enhances investment confidence and decision-making, underscoring the importance of targeted financial education programs to empower individuals to participate effectively in the stock market. Recent trends show that women, particularly baby boomers, are increasingly controlling significant amounts of wealth. As of January 2025, women over 60 control $8 trillion of liquid wealth assets. This shift underscores the importance of financial literacy and proactive investment strategies among women to ensure long-term financial security.

2,2025-02-10,"Scalpers have a stranglehold on online orders, and theÂ Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090Â andÂ RTX 5080 GPUsÂ were only the latest victims of money-grubbing resellers. Nvidia’s high-end graphics cards had such limited supply and enormous demand that leeches started sellingÂ some cards for three orÂ four times the price of the $2,000 5090. One OEM has a novel solution to the scalper problem. Rather than dropping more stock on digital storefronts, itâs selling its cards through a direct-to-consumer raffle.
Those who join the U.S. Discord for Zotac and show that they are human by posting and engaging can enter the companyâs raffle to buy the RTX 5080 or 5090 at MSRP.Â Videocardz first caught onto the scheme, whichâdespite its casino natureâseems much fairer to buyers than trawling through eBay looking for a second-hand GPU.
Starting Feb. 7, the company has offered âgiveawaysâ (though we should note it’s not a âgiveawayâ if you still have to buy it) for RTX 5080 and 5090 cards at regular intervals. Participants have around two hours to put their names in the hat. These drops occur on weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. PT or 12 p.m. to 8 p.m. ET. One of Zotacâs community moderators clarified on Discord that âIt is completely RNG-based. This is an opportunity to win to PURCHASE the card; this is NOT for a free graphics card.â
In its announcement post, Zotac explained that participants must be server members and âactively engage in challenges, discussions, and community activities. Spam low-effort messages will not count.â Thereâs only one card âper household.â Even better, Zotac said it keeps track of serial numbers if somebody tries to resell the card immediately for a premium.
Anybody who wins the raffle wonât know how much the card will cost until Zotac reaches out to them. The OEM has promoted its three-fan config $2,200 GeForce RTX 5090 SOLID, SOLID OC, and 5090 AMP Extreme INFINITY on its site. Those cards are currently out of stock from popular websites like Newegg. Zotac is a smaller OEM than competitors like Gigabyte or Asus, and it only receives half a dozen or fewer cards for sale at a time.
The situation is so ridiculous that some consumers prefer an RTX 50-series raffle to the current stock situation. Before launch, Nvidia told buyers there wouldnât be enough GPUs to meet demand. Nvidia previously told Gizmodo itâs still expecting to launch the RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti sometime this month, though the company has yet to provide a more specific release date. As noted by VideoCardz, French retailer topAchat listed RTX 5070 availability as Feb. 20. Either way, we may not have to wait long to learn if the mid-range Nvidia GPUs will have as limited stock as the $1,000+ graphics cards.

          As Nvidia RTX 5090 GPU is in such hot demand many stores are already sold out, but we suggest you don't get fooled by both the scalpers or anti-scalpers on eBay.
        

          Some gamers are already camping out during one of the coldest times in the year to get their hands on a $2,000 graphics card.
        

          Nvidiaâs RTX 5090 Founders Edition is a two-fan GPU thatâs seriously hefty, though somehow smaller and more menacing than the RTX 4090.
        

          Get ready to watch the lights on your block dim as you plug in the upcoming Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, a GPU that may have 5,000 more CUDA cores than the last gen.

3,2025-02-10,"Kendrick Lamar wanted a GNX. Not the one from the cover of his new album of the same name. One that could be gutted and turned into a “clown car” for his Super Bowl LIX halftime show. That’s how Shelley Rodgers, the show’s art director, tells it. Rodgers has solved such big-stage problems for everyone from Beyoncé to Lady Gaga; she won an Emmy for her work on Rihanna’s halftime show in 2023. A car wasn’t a huge deal, but she still needed to find one. They couldn’t borrow Lamar’s own Buick Grand National because they’d kind of need to destroy it to pull off the visual trick.
“That car was not easy to find, especially since he dropped his album,” Rodgers says. “We could have just used his, but I don’t know that he would’ve liked it after.”
Shelley Rodgers has been the art director for Super Bowl halftime shows for everyone from Lady Gaga to Rihanna.
Erik Eastland from All Access, the company responsible for fabricating the stage for Sunday’s show, was the one who found what Lamar wanted. Eastland and his team located the GNX at a mom-and-pop car lot in Riverside, California, after a thorough search and at least one near mishap.
The Buick GNX used during Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl halftime show came from a dealership in Southern California.
As anyone watching the halftime show knows, it worked. Right on cue, as Lamar rapped his way through “Bodies,” the car that Eastland found and gutted popped open to reveal a small army of dancers. It highlighted just one of four stages Lamar used during the halftime show. Each performance space was shaped like a button on a PlayStation-style controller, a performance intended to portray Lamar’s life as a video game.
These polycarbonate panels were used to enclose Kendrick Lamar during his Super Bowl performance.
The custom-built streetlights used during the halftime show.
That concept came from Lamar himself. Rodgers says she doesn’t know if the concept has anything to do with his highly publicized beef with Drake but will say that Lamar had a vision for what he wanted his show to be, and she made it her mission to execute it. “I think the [video game theme] was symbolic, his way to reach young people,” Rodgers says. “A lot of it is showing his journey, traveling through the American dream.”
Every aspect of the Super Bowl halftime show is meticulously planned to ensure everyone—and everything—gets on and off the field in a matter of minutes.
During a press conference held Thursday by the show's sponsor, Apple Music, Lamar promised to bring “storytelling” in his performance. The “rudimentary shapes” on the field on Sunday were meant to provide a clean, easy-to-understand platform for the rapper to tell that story, says creative director Mike Carson, who worked with Lamar, director Dave Free, and other members of Lamar's creative company pgLang to develop the halftime show's look and sound.
“Dave Free and Kendrick are really into keeping things clean and minimal,” Carson adds. “So we went with a monochromatic concrete look and allowed the video game motif to come alive through dialogue, lighting, choreography, and music.""

Concept art for Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl halftime show.
Working with artists who know exactly what they want isn’t always a given. Some come to Rodgers and her colleagues and say, “What do you got?” she says. Lamar, Free, and Carson came to the table with the idea. Rodgers and her crew at Tribe Inc., which was founded by her husband, production designer Bruce Rodgers, and has been designing the Super Bowl halftime show for nearly two decades, just needed to make it work.
The idea to have the halftime show performance space evoke video games came from Kendrick Lamar and his frequent collaborators Mike Carson and Dave Free.
All of the staging, lights, and performers have to get on the field in 7.5 minutes and then off of it 6 minutes after the performance ends.
“They were on board with our vision from day one,” Carson says. ""Even with this being one of the largest halftime footprints ever, Shelley and team came with clever ideas and guidance to help us maintain the design integrity and get this beast across the finish line.”
While “making it work” means one thing when you’re putting on a Madonna concert or the Democratic National Convention, it means something different when you’re trying to squeeze it into a national title match between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles. For one, you have to get all of the staging, lights, dancers, and the artist themselves onto the field in 7.5 minutes and then get them off 6 minutes after the final note. For another, you have to do all of this on a field where the biggest NFL game of the year is being played—without screwing up the turf.
The “turf tires” that equipment carts ride on to protect the field.
Large custom tarps were laid out onto the field prior to the halftime show.
Fields are very important in the NFL. Two years ago, when the Rodgerses (both of them) did the Rihanna show, they created platforms that floated above the playing area to keep Rihanna off the grass. They caught a break this year; the Superdome in New Orleans has a synthetic field, which is far more resilient than the natural turf at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.
These streetlights were constructed to hold dancers during the performance.
The tires on halftime show equipment carts are made to protect the Super Bowl field.
Limitations have been fueling halftime show innovations for years, says the NFL's head of music, Seth Dudowsky. For years, he says, the show simply required setting up a stage for a rock band and taking it down. A little over a decade ago, when artists like Madonna and Katy Perry started doing the show, they brought a desire to make it more theatrical and concert-like. When the Weeknd performed in 2021, Covid-19 restrictions as well as field restrictions dictated that most of the performance take place on stages built around Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida.
The Weeknd’s performance “allowed us to break the mold,” Dudowsky says. The following year, when Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, 50 Cent, Eminem, and Lamar performed, halftime organizers were able to erect 25-foot stages and get them on and off the field in a matter of minutes. Each time, the Rodgerses and All Access have figured out how to make it happen.
Protecting the field is essential in the NFL.
“Each year, each creative pushes the envelope,” Dudowsky says. “But then you have this amazing art team and production design team that pulls it back into reality and says, ‘How are we going to do this in the time we have, in the building we have, and make it something that we can actually execute for a Super Bowl halftime show?’”
For Lamar’s video game-themed show that meant more than 50 carts of staging and equipment—each weighing between 1,500 and 3,500 pounds—to be rolled out in the center of the stadium. To protect the field, the carts rode on specially designed wheels (“turf tires” is their nontechnical name), so the playing surface remains ready for the game’s second half.
Those precious minutes aren’t the only time crunch the organizers are under. As halftime shows get “bigger and bigger,” Eastland says, “the time that we get to build” doesn’t increase.
Lamar announced he’d be performing at the Super Bowl on September 8. Then he had until Thanksgiving to come up with a concept for the show. By the time everyone agreed on the plan and Eastland could start building stages—“cutting metal” as he calls it—it was early December. When we spoke in mid-January, he was loading the last of the 25 trucks his crew would drive from Southern California to New Orleans. (Luckily, none of All Access’ facilities were affected by the Los Angeles area wildfires, but some of the rehearsals did get postponed.)
There was one other restriction: the stadium entrances. Unlike some arenas, the Superdome has only one main tunnel that organizers could use to bring everything onto the field for Sunday’s show—and it dumps out right into a field goalpost. Eastland had less than 10 feet of clearance to get everything through. “It’s a field that’s not our favorite, because it’s that one tunnel that we all come flying through with 3,000 people,” Eastland says. “There’s the goalpost right there, dead center.”
Setting up for the Super Bowl halftime show must be done in a matter of minutes.
Crews of dozens of people set up each stage and tear it back down after the performance.
So, about that GNX. While Eastland is “good at finding stuff like that,” Shelley Rodgers says it was still a challenge. Ever since Lamar released GNX, the 1980s two-door Buicks have seen a surge in popularity. Car aficionados have long held the GNX in high regard, and Eastland presumed no one who has maintained one of the cars for nearly four decades would want to sell it to someone planning to tear it apart.
Even those willing to sell presented peculiar problems. Before he located the one All Access eventually bought, Eastland’s car guy found himself in a pickle when a potential seller said their name wasn’t on the title because the owner was dead.
All Access, the company responsible for fabricating the stage for Sunday’s show, found the vintage GNX used during the performance.
“I don't know if it was stolen or not, but that's the kind of nonsense that we can run into,” Eastland says, recounting the story. “I think at the end of the day, it could have been a lot harder.”
Once he got the car from a used car lot in Riverside, he still had to gut it—something even he admits was “sacrilegious.” But, Eastland argues, the people who appreciate Lamar’s music and his passion for the GNX were “going to need to see the car and not a cheap imposter” during Sunday’s halftime show.
Still, I have to ask, could the car be put back together again? Sadly, no. It could go on tour with Lamar, Eastland says, but its days as a street-legal vehicle are over. Eastland says he’s lucky he bought the GNX before its appearance in the halftime show drives up its value on the used market even more. “I got to believe that the price for these things is going to go way up for a while.”
Lamar, and the GNX, now go down in history.

4,2025-02-10,"As the UK approaches its' climate change goals, ""support"" is needed to encourage motorists in Northern Ireland to switch to electric vehicles (EVs), one EV driver has said.
""The cars need to be more affordable and there needs to be proper infrastructure,"" Stephen Kane said. 
The Electric Vehicle Association NI (EVANI) said it was too early to ""take away the incentives"" such as free public charging and financial schemes.
Meanwhile, the Department for Transport (DfT) said there are ""already a range of incentives"" such as favourable taxation rates and targeted grants, and it will support ""continued demand"".
Stephen Kane was able to own an EV through a workplace scheme.
He said: ""The cost of buying an electric car privately is still too expensive. If I had to buy it privately I couldn't afford it.""
Mr Kane also said the infrastructure for charging in Northern Ireland is ""terrible"".
""We were going to a wedding in Fermanagh, so we literally drove without the heating on just to get there and back,"" he said.
""I had to ask someone to charge it overnight.""
Mr Kane doesn't think we will reach net climate change targets ""until electric cars become cheaper to purchase"".
""Overall an electric car is a really nice car to drive, I think it is the way forward. 
""But I just think there needs to be support,"" he added.
Darren Henderson, director of EVANI, said ""disinformation"" on social media is affecting people's decision to buy an EV.
""Petrochemical companies are throwing information out there to try and slow things down,"" he said.
Mr Henderson said ""just a few short years ago"" ""range anxiety"" was ""a real difficulty in Northern Ireland but we have certainly turned a corner"".
""In three years, we have had a 700% increase in rapid chargers, it's by no means finished but is far more available than it was.""
He added that the gap in price between EVs and petrol or diesel vehicles is also closing.
Mr Henderson said hydrogen will have ""a place"" but not in passenger vehicles as the ""efficiency just doesn't work out"".
In July 2024, there were 27,580 electric vehicles on Northern Ireland's roads, according to the Department for Transport.
This includes battery electric, petrol hybrid, diesel hybrid and range extended electric vehicles.
In absence of DfT data, the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders (SMMT) shows a further increase of 4,459 registrations of electric vehicles in the second half of 2024.
This indicates that there are over 32,000 EVs on the road in Northern Ireland.
Currently, the UK government plans to ban the sale of new petrol or diesel cars and vans by 2030 and new hybrid vehicles by 2035.
In January 2025, the Zero Emission Vehicle Mandate and Vehicle Emissions Trading Schemes were introduced in Northern Ireland.
The Department for Infrastructure (DfI) said the schemes will increase the number of cars in the new market and build on stock in the second-hand market.
It says the sale of EVs remain ""encouraging"" but reaching net zero by 2050 will be ""challenging"".
""Decarbonising private cars will be important for tackling the climate crisis, and the department continues to work with other jurisdictions and the private sector to develop this process,"" the DfI added.
""However, we also need to provide attractive sustainable transport alternatives.""
George McMillan, owner of a car garage, said that hydrogen powered vehicles are the ""real future"".
""I would jump into the hydrogen vehicle straight away,"" he said.
""I know in 20 years' time for our customers that would be something we could stand behind.
""I could see a future in it but I don't see a future in the fully electric vehicle.""
He said the government has ""panicked and put everything into the electric car basket"" when the ""infrastructure is no where near where it should be"".
Stephen Mack, chairman of the Comber Classic Car Club believes electric vehicles ""have a pretty bad press"".
Although Mr Mack shared how there are issues with electric cars such as the price, mileage, battery life, depreciation and appearance.
""You couldn't tell the difference of a car with a petrol or diesel engine, I would like to say the same about an electric car,"" he said.
""These EVs are disposable, they will never be classics like we had.
""There's no feel, there's no sound, there's no oil dripping out of it"".

5,2025-02-10,"Sex tech gadgets—from robot dildos to AI-powered dolls—are becoming increasingly sophisticated, with a near-endless range of options available to suit every taste and desire imaginable. Any lightly horny Amazon Prime member can now click a few times and receive a wide variety of colorful vibrators and lubes in every flavor under the sun in less than 24 hours. Design trends are leaning sophisticated, too—some modern devices look more like abstract contemporary sculptures than the more in-your-face vulgar masturbatory aids of earlier eras.
Tenga's “eggs” are slightly larger than a chicken egg and are similar to a disposable version of a Fleshlight in function.
The eggs are sold in drugstores and via online retailers like Amazon.
WIRED went looking for love and found that modern romance is a web of scams, AI boyfriends, and Tinder burnout. But a smarter, more human, and more pleasure-filled future is possible.
But despite the buzz around teledildonics, virtual-reality romance, and other futuristic pleasure offerings, some of the most enduringly popular products in the sex gadget world aren’t notable for their cutting-edge technology; they’re notable for their simplicity. The Japanese company Tenga, which was founded in 2005 and has acquired an unusually loyal following, offers a wide range of products, including some traditional vibrators, lotions, and a “sperm observation kit” for male fertility planning. It’s akin to the Uniqlo of adult toy companies—focused on affordable basics and fond of flashy celebrity collaborations.
Like Uniqlo, Tenga has, for example, partnered with the Keith Haring Foundation to create Haring-themed merchandise. But its most iconic creation is the “egg”—a line of toys marketed toward men, sold everywhere from Tokyo drugstores and vending machines to online giants like Amazon and Walmart.
These eggs—which are slightly larger than a chicken egg and, to put it bluntly, similar to a disposable version of a Fleshlight in function—have been around since 2008. Tenga sold more than 2.7 million of them in 2024 alone, according to the company. “It’s one of our top-selling products around the world,” says Monica Chang, Tenga’s digital marketing head.
These eggs aren’t exactly eco-friendly; unlike standard-issue sex toys, their shelf life is typically limited to a single use. They’re also not necessarily cheap. Costs vary slightly based on region, but people in the United States are typically paying around $6 per egg. (At least for the real-deal product—knockoffs on sites like Temu and AliExpress go for less than a dollar each.) Quick math suggests that even higher-end traditional sex toys wind up being more economically sensible after a dozen or so uses.
So why do people love these eggs so much? Part of Tenga’s enduring success is that it went after customers who were specifically looking for convenience—and the temporary nature of the product is part of what they find appealing.
While sex toys are not as stigmatized as they once were, they are still something that many people would prefer to purchase and use privately. Someone on a business trip, for example, can pick up a few eggs on arrival, discard them after use, and return home without ever having to worry about an awkward encounter at airport security. “They are great for travel,” says Katy Zvolerin, the director of public relations for the online sex toy hub Adam & Eve, referring to the disposable sleeve category as a whole.
Zvolerin says that the company has seen sales for disposable products rising and that it expects demand to continue to increase. She says one reason for their popularity is that people are sometimes hesitant to pull the trigger on buying an expensive toy. “It makes sense for a lot of people to try a lower-cost, one-off product before investing hundreds of dollars into something that may not work for them,” she says.
Some consumers also may want to avoid the ick factor involved with owning a longer-lasting device of this nature. To clean a reusable version, one must often manually wash it out, flip it inside out, and air-dry it. “Disposable stuff makes sense for this category,” says Hallie Lieberman, a historian who wrote a book on the history of sex toys in 2017.
Lieberman sees Tenga’s approach to marketing and design as crucial to its success. (And part of a storied national lineage: “The Japanese have always been artificial-vagina innovators,” she says, noting that there is documentation of “a tortoise shell lined with velvet” filled with a “slimy” material in 17th-century Japanese erotic literature.) The eggs often come bundled in cartons that look like something one might find in a grocery store; once opened, they each resemble a stretchy sleeve and come in a variety of textures, but nothing about the packaging or details gives away their intimate purpose.
Unlike the Fleshlight, which is flamboyantly anatomical in design—some versions are even molded to resemble the crotches of individual porn stars—the eggs are downright discreet. “It looks like a fun tech product, even though it’s not that techy. And it seems almost asexual,” Lieberman says. She thinks the eggs look like what Apple might release if it ever got into the sex toy market.
Tenga says all of these choices are deliberate: Approachable aesthetics have always been a key part of the company’s appeal. “For many people, the eggs were the first time they saw a sex toy that didn’t look like a sex toy,” says Andreas Nishio, a longtime Tenga employee.
“Many people still have in their heart a feeling that sex toys are shameful or dirty. But this is a cute little egg. It’s much easier for them to pick up.”
Tenga now considers itself as a lifestyle company more than anything else, with a focus on wellness. In Japan, its merchandise offerings include an entire specialty line of streetwear, and its flagship Tokyo store is in the upscale Ginza shopping district rather than neighborhoods typically associated with sex shops and maid cafés such as Akihabara.
At this particular moment, the nonthreatening and ambiguous appearance of Tenga’s eggs might make them even more appealing in countries like the United States that are rapidly becoming more conservative. In Texas, for example, there’s currently an effort to introduce legislation that would make it illegal to sell sex toys in drugstores.
It’s part of a wider push to ban or suppress sexual expression. “If you have a masturbation sleeve that looks like an egg and that could plausibly be sold as, say, a stress-relief ball,” says Lieberman, “in an increasingly anti-sex American society, that would allow this product to exist in more places.”

7,2025-02-10,"The game is available again — nearly 70 years after it was created
by  Cameron Faulkner
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.
General Headquarters, or GHQ, is a board game designed by Kurt Vonnegut that was long thought to be lost. But not only was it found, cleaned up, and packaged for sale, it’s back in stock at Barnes & Noble after a period of being unavailable. The game designer Geoff Engelstein who was pivotal to its existence confirmed via BlueSky that GHQ is available once again for $34.99.
In an late 2024 interview with Polygon, Engelstein shared how he discovered the game’s resources in the archives at Indiana University and brought it to life with permission from the Vonnegut estate. The story of its discovery is worth reading, and it’s worth celebrating that Vonnegut designed a game before later continuing to produce even more excellent written work.

We recently published a list of 10 AI News Updates You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other AI news updates you should not miss.
Europe is putting itself on the artificial map with France and the United Arab Emirates having agreed to a framework accord for a 1 gigawatt data center dedicated to artificial intelligence. The French presidency said in a statement that the center will be the core of a new AI “campus” and will have up to 1 gigawatt of capacity, “which represents investments of 30 to 50 billion euros”.

The move is said to be a part of a larger AI agreement signed between French President Emmanuel Macron and his UAE counterpart Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Paris. President Emmanuel Macron hosted his Emirati counterpart on Thursday.
“The two leaders expressed their desire to create a strategic partnership in the field of AI and committed to exploring collaborations on projects and investments supporting the development of the AI ​​value chain”.
According to the leaders, the investments would go into both French and Emirati AI and would include buying advanced chips, building data centers, talent development, and establishing virtual data embassies to secure AI and cloud systems in both countries.
France is also going to be hosting the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Summit at the Grand Palais on February 10-11, 2025. The country has deemed the summit a “wake-up call” for Europe in the global race for AI.
“The summit comes at exactly the right time for this wake-up call for France and Europe, and to show we are in position” to take advantage of the technology, an official in Macron’s office told reporters.
Attendees at the summit will include Sam Altman, head of OpenAI, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Nobel Prize winner Demis Hassabis, who leads the company’s DeepMind AI research unit, amongst many other industry leaders, government officials, and similar figures from around the world.

Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an American technology company offering e-commerce, cloud computing, and other services, including digital streaming and artificial intelligence solutions. On February 7, RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson raised the firm’s price target on the stock to $265 from $255 and kept an “Outperform” rating on the shares. The analyst told investors in a research note that the company’s Q4 results were mixed with a slight miss on third-party seller services and advertising revenues. There is also an implied $100B+ capex guide. These factors outweigh the company’s solid figures from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and continued EBITDA outperformance. The firm also stated that Amazon.com shares are “crowded” and the AI “spend money to make money” debate will undoubtedly continue, but AWS’s high margin growth and further network cost efficiencies will help the company grow its earnings at a level that justifies its valuation.
Overall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of AI news updates you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

9,2025-02-10,"Sebastian has no problem with artificial intelligence. At least, not if it can help the San Francisco thirtysomething connect with more bubble-butt users on hookup apps like Grindr. “If the AI can find someone I can just do the work with, I’m fine,” he says. “No talk. Just push-ups.”
WIRED went looking for love and found that modern romance is a web of scams, AI boyfriends, and Tinder burnout. But a smarter, more human, and more pleasure-filled future is possible.
Lucky for Sebastian, Grindr aims to please. Machine-learning features are prominent on the app’s product road map for 2025. CEO George Arison believes the addition of AI tools to the app, which largely caters to LGBTQ+ singles, could prove beneficial for users looking to discover new people worth messaging or possibly connecting with again. Further in the future, the app hopes to release a “wingman” chatbot, currently being beta tested by a limited number of users, that will provide tailored advice and even suggest date spots.
As the generative AI race heated up following OpenAI’s release of ChatGPT in 2022, execs at many dating app companies looked to integrate the technology into their user experiences. Bumble founder Whitney Wolfe Herd pitched the idea of AI dating personas automatically interacting on behalf of users. Her app is currently working on AI-powered profile creation and messaging options. Not to be left out, Tinder dropped a tool in 2024 designed to help you pick the best profile photos; it plans to roll out AI-assisted matches later this year.
Late last year, Hinge CEO Justin McLeod promised the app would soon be using the tech for everything from making matches to AI coaching. “While AI is not going to be a panacea when it comes to the very deeply and personal problem of love,” he told investors, “I can tell you that it is going to transform the dating app experience.”
Several AI-focused newcomers have also entered the fray in recent years. These tools focus more on AI advice than using machine learning to build networks of eligible daters. Rizz (yes, really) went viral for helping users on existing dating platforms role-play different responses to matches, earning an international following. Hell, even the Hawk Tuah girl released a dating advice app, called Pookie Tools, which included a flirt meter, height detector, and bald predictor.
AI, if it hasn’t already, is coming for your swipes. It couldn’t be a better, or worse, time. Many people feel like the current ways dating apps connect them with others aren’t successful, but they’re still looking online for love—and sex. As generative AI has seeped into all parts of online life, being able to discern what’s genuine has only gotten harder. Adding bot-on-bot action to the mix sure doesn’t sound like the answer. But if it’s not, is there anything that can save digital dating from itself?
Of all the new tools out there, Iris Dating might be the one for those already deep into AI-assisted meetups. With over a million downloads from the Google Play Store since 2019, Iris is busy. It seemed like a good place to start if I wanted to find out whether all these AI widgets were worth it.
After downloading the app, Iris asked for my location and a few scant details about who I was hoping to be matched with. Then, without warning, a disembodied woman’s head popped up on the screen and encouraged me with her robotic voice to take a photo of my face for verification purposes and to keep the app a “safe space.”
The last phase of the setup involved swiping left and right on stock images of people’s faces until the app, supposedly, figured out what profiles matched my true “#AttractionDNA.” Despite choosing men and women of various racial backgrounds during the swiping, most of the matches Iris connected me with were women living in the Philippines. Iris CEO and founder Igor Khalatian explained over email that this was likely due to the app recently going viral with Filipino users. He added that the company is working on a better balance for these connections.
One person I connected with, Chloe, was an avid user of the app and thought the vague AI aspect was cool and beneficial.
“Yeah, it’s helpful,” she told me. “Because you can have some good friends on here.” Despite using the app for the past six months and enjoying the conversations, Chloe hadn’t yet met up with any of her matches in person. (All user names in this story have been changed to preserve anonymity.)
Another one of the women, Althea, was new to the app, using it alongside other options like Bumpy and OkCupid. Althea didn’t really care much about the AI aspect of Iris. “I don’t know,” she says. “I just guess I can find a serious relationship here maybe.”
As I spoke with more women on the app, it was fairly clear that many of the users hewed closer to Althea’s point of view than to Chloe’s. Connecting with the right person through a hookup or dating app feels like a numbers game to many people as they juggle multiple accounts. Ultimately, everyone feels like they’re algorithm chum even before they get into AI tools. These users are willing to show up wherever it seems like other people worth finding might be hanging out.
Some of the Grindr users that I reached out to in San Francisco were similarly ambivalent about the app’s plans for AI features, and almost no one had heard about the wingman chatbot, despite living in America’s tech capital. As long as it doesn’t interfere too much with their core goals on Grindr, this subset of users didn’t seem to care either way about new tools.
Another group of users were turned off to learn about the plans for more AI features. “I am philosophically very anti-AI,” Tomás told me. “Part of relationship building—be it sexual, romantic, platonic—involves dealing with friction. I think the more organic approach is to not have AI involved.” While Tomás acknowledged that AI features might be potentially helpful for other users, he doesn’t see the tools as aligning with his personal beliefs or real reason for using the app: sex.
I messaged Sebastian again to better understand his perspective, curious if he had other thoughts about AI tools, dating apps, and hookups that he wanted to share. “Yes, man. Many,” he wrote, before dropping four huge, blue-bubble messages in our chat together. His answer listed four pros (better matches, improved safety, conversation starters, profile optimization) and four cons (lack of authenticity, privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, overreliance on AI), organized neatly into lists and accompanied by emoji. It’s immediately clear what Sebastian is up to, so I asked if that answer was generated by AI. He quickly responds, “Yes. So, you get me?”

Listen up, friends.Â The Apple AirPods Pro wireless ear buds are on sale over at Amazon for 32% off, and new features are available now with iOS18. Apple stuff hardly ever sees decent discounts, so why not score yourself a set for just $169? They are normally $249 so you’d be saving yourself a whole $80. These ones specifically are the 2nd generation model, supporting a wide range of useful features.
See at Amazon
The Apple H2 chip allows these AirPods to perform intelligent noise cancellation with deep immersive sound. Youâll get twice as much active noise cancellation as comparable ear buds on the market which means less noise and better focus for you, whether youâre trying to drown out the sounds of the engine on a plane or train, or just really need to not be distracted in a busy and loud office environment. Plus, you can watch and listen to select songs, shows, and movies in Dolby Atmos for high-quality, immersive spatial audio.
Then when you do need to hear the world around you again, flip to transparency mode and hear your surrounds without needing to remove the AirPods. Adaptative Audio is also able to seamlessly blend between both transparency mode and active noise cancellation, giving you the best listening experience for the environment you find yourself in.
The AirPods Pro are designed to fit any ear as the box includes four pairs on silicone tips. Each are sized for XS, S, M, and L fits, so no matter your ear size, they will fit nice and snug. The tips create an acoustic seal which secures them in place and works alongside its active noise cancelation to keep noise out.
Weâve all got our workout playlists we want to listen to when we hit the gym, lift weights, or go out for a run. Well you can listen to your favorite songs or latest podcast episodes while you work your body because the AirPods Pro are sweat and water resistant.
Control playback with ease. Touch controls allow you to swipe up or down to adjust volume, press to play or pause and mute or unmute yourself on calls. Tapping twice will end calls. Do it all without taking your phone out of your pocket.
The battery life of these is nothing to sneeze at. The AirPods Pro and its case will get you up to six hours of listening time when using Active Noise Cancellation. With that turned off, youâll be reaching up to 30 hours before needing to plug in.
Normally,Â the 2nd generation AirPods Pro go for $250, but right now you can get them 32% off at just $169.

13,2025-02-10,"Elon Musk's efforts to slash spending at the US government could start to weigh on Tesla vehicle sales, according to Stephen Gengaro, a research analyst at Stifel.
In a note over the weekend, Gengaro highlighted proprietary survey from the firm data showing consumers are souring on Musk, with Tesla's net favorability rating tanking to near-record lows.
According to the data, Tesla had a net favorability rating of around 30% from 2018 through 2021. The favorability rating started to trend lower around the same time Musk jumpstarted his efforts to acquire X (formerly Twitter) and now stands at just 3%.
""With the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) making headlines regarding its efforts to streamline government agencies, opinions on Elon Musk have taken a turn for the worse along political affiliations,"" Gengaro said.
""Democrats are clearly being skeptical of 'handing over government data to a nonelected billionaire' while many Republicans seem to be supporting DOGE, or at least are happy with Musk's support of Trump,"" he added.
That could pose a problem for Tesla since future electric vehicle owners tend to skew toward Democrats more than Republicans, according to the note.
Gengaro said the ""decline in consumers' perception of Elon Musk"" could ultimately result in a ""headwind to sales.""  
It's a trend that may already be playing out for the carmaker. 
Tesla reported its first-ever decline in annual vehicle sales in 2024, when the company's favorability rating had already dipped into the single digits.
And its recent commentary about a return to growth in 2025 left some analysts feeling underwhelmed.
Finally, the Trump administration's decisions to halt the funding of an EV charging network buildout and plans to scrap mandates that would have boosted electric vehicle sales could also be negative catalysts for Tesla.
Investors have acted accordingly, with Tesla stock declining 15% since the inauguration of President Trump.
Gengaro, meanwhile, is still bullish on the stock but trimmed his price target to $472 from $492, about 32% higher than current levels.

    Layoffs, wildfires and deportations. Why is the jobs report still positive?
  
Over the last few weeks, there's been massive disruption in the labor market with President Donald Trump's administration moving to freeze federal aid and lay off tens of thousands of federal workers. That's on top of a flurry of executive orders, threats of trade wars, the start of mass deportations and stock market volatility. 
But on Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released what investors and market watchers considered a ""positive"" jobs report for January. That disconnect has me scratching my head. 
One explanation is that economic data is backward-looking: Friday's report reflects the state of the labor market in January, before the relative chaos began. Even so, I expected there would at least be some impact from the destructive LA wildfires, which saw hundreds of thousands of Californians apply for unemployment benefits.  
Instead, the most recent labor data shows unemployment low and steady, clocking in at 4%. Plus, job growth is still apparently moving at a healthy pace.
Maybe official labor data isn't a reliable narrator of what's really happening, nor what's to come. 
Lisa Countryman-Quiroz, CEO of JVS Bay Area, a workforce development nonprofit, said there's no question that the new administration's actions will cause instability for both workers and employers, with consequences that will ripple across industries in 2025. 
Job market indicators paint a broad picture and reflect past trends, but they don't accurately reflect the economic realities of different areas, populations or industries. 
As someone who writes about the relationship between labor data, the housing market and the Federal Reserve, I wasn't surprised to see economists positively spin Friday's labor report. News reports decreed that the economy is ""resilient"" and ""strong"" and that the job market ""could not be better."" 
Yet ask your average person about finding stable and well-paid employment, and you'll likely get a very different answer. In 2024, Pathrise Job Market data shows it took jobseekers an average of eight months and 294 applications to land a job. 
It's not an exaggeration to say the economy feels like it's in freefall. The State Department's order for an immediate 90-day pause on foreign aid, championed by Elon Musk, has left many government contractors and global agencies struggling to operate or even pay their workers. Meanwhile, some 65,000 federal workers have accepted an offer to resign in exchange for pay until Sept. 30. The White House has said it hopes for as many as 200,000 workers to participate in the buyout, which was recently temporarily suspended by a federal judge.
Moreover, Trump is taking aggressive action to ramp up the deportation of undocumented immigrants, who comprise nearly 1 in 20 workers, with even greater representation in construction, agriculture and hospitality. The forced removal of masses of workers, who contribute billions of dollars in state and federal taxes, could result in low-wage job vacancies, higher labor costs, supply chain disruptions and increased inflation.
""The President has shifted policy directions several times,"" said Gene Ludwig, former comptroller of the currency and founder of the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity.
""It's too soon to gauge the net effect of his policies on employment,"" Ludwig told me in an email. 
Economic data, like Friday's job report, also affects major monetary decisions, like adjusting interest rates. The Federal Reserve needs to strike a balance between inflation and unemployment, and it examines official statistics to determine its next move.
First, the central bank wants to see inflation slow down before cutting interest rates again. But that doesn't seem likely anytime soon, given the threat of tariffs, which are expected to drive up prices. 
Second, the Fed is looking for signs of weakness in the labor market. Though the Fed doesn't want unemployment levels to dive to recession levels, a ""healthy"" labor market tells the central bank that the economy can afford high borrowing rates.
Odds were already low for the Fed to cut interest rates at its next meeting in March. But now it's even clearer that the central bank will delay rate cuts until May or June at the earliest. It could take months to get a clear picture of how the administration's policies will affect the jobs market, consumer prices and the cost of borrowing. 
""Any indicator that shows a slowing economy would raise the chances of a rate cut, especially rising unemployment,"" said Greg Heym, chief economist at Brown Harris Stevens. 
In the meantime, we'll just have to settle for different definitions of what constitutes a positive jobs report. 
""A strong labor market relies on expanding opportunities for jobseekers, not restricting them,"" said Countryman-Quiroz. "
16,2025-02-10,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said he will announce on Monday that the United States will impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports, including from Canada and Mexico, as well as other import duties later in the week.
“Any steel coming into the United States is going to have a 25% tariff,” he told reporters Sunday on Air Force One as he flew from Florida to New Orleans to attend the Super Bowl. When asked about aluminum, he responded, “aluminum, too” will be subject to the trade penalties.

Trump also reaffirmed that he would announce “reciprocal tariffs” — “probably Tuesday or Wednesday” — meaning that the U.S. would impose import duties on products in cases where another country has levied duties on U.S. goods.
“If they are charging us 130% and we’re charging them nothing, it’s not going to stay that way,” he told reporters.
Trump's comments are the latest example of his willingness to threaten, and in some cases to impose, import taxes. Tariffs are coming much earlier in his presidency than during his previous four years in the White House, when he prioritized tax cuts and deregulation. Trump has alternately said he sees import taxes as tools to force concessions on issues such as immigration, but also as a source of revenue to help close the government's budget deficit.
Financial markets fell on Friday after Trump first said he would impose the reciprocal tariffs. Stock prices also dropped after a measure of consumer sentiment declined on Friday, largely because many respondents cited tariffs as a growing worry. The survey also found that Americans are expecting inflation to tick up in the coming months because of the duties.
Trump on Sunday did not offer any details about the steel and aluminum duties, or the reciprocal tariffs. Trump previously threatened 25% import taxes on all goods from Canada and Mexico, though he paused them for 30 days barely a week ago. At the same time, he proceeded to add 10% duties on imports from China.
Yet on Friday, he said he would also delay the tariffs on the millions of small packages — often from fast-fashion firms such as Temu and Shein — until customs officials can figure out ways to impose them. The small packages have previously been exempt from tariffs.
Trump's latest remarks stirred immediate worry from some global trading partners.
South Korea’s acting president, Choi Sang-mok, called a meeting with the country’s top foreign policy and trade officials on Monday to examine how Trump’s proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum would affect its industries.
The office of Choi, who also serves as the country’s finance minister, said officials discussed the potential impact and Seoul’s possible responses, but specific details of the meeting were not disclosed. The stock prices of major South Korean steelmakers, including POSCO and Hyundai Steel, dropped as the market opened on Monday. South Korea shipped about $4.8 billion worth of steel to the United States from January to November last year, which accounted for 14% of its global exports of the products during the period.

17,2025-02-10,"Equities (^DJI, ^IXIC, ^GSPC) are moving higher ahead of Monday's session close after President Trump announced plans to enact a 25% tariff on all steel and ..."
18,2025-02-10,"President Donald Trump announced on Air Force One Sunday that he would impose a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, the latest move as part of the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and its allies. 
Tariffs refer to taxes that are placed on imported goods, or products that come into the country. Importers have to pay tariffs to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which could cause companies to increase prices on their goods to make up for the additional taxes they have to pay. 
The move is meant to help domestic steel and aluminum companies, but could also cause local companies that rely on foreign steel to struggle. 
The U.S. is the world’s second-largest steel importer, with the top three import sources being Canada, Brazil, and Mexico, although other countries, such as South Korea, heavily rely on exporting steel to the U.S.
Steel and aluminum are heavily used in the automotive and construction industry, but are also used to manufacture goods and appliances. 
The decision mirrors the actions Trump levied during his first Administration, when he enacted a 25% tariff on steel and 10% tariff on aluminum, though some countries, including South Korea were exempt. 
In response to the most-recent tariff announcement, shares of major South Korean steelmakers in the country fell on the stock market Monday morning, while that of U.S. steel companies rose. 
On average, the U.S. imports more than 2 million metric tons of steel mill products per month, according to data by the Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration, but only about a quarter of all steel in the U.S. is imported, as total steel imports have been decreasing year-over-year. 
“You see these empty, old, beautiful steel mills and factories that are empty and falling down,” Trump said on the campaign trail in October 2024. “We’re going to bring the companies back. We’re going to lower taxes for companies that are going to make their products in the USA. And we’re going to protect those companies with strong tariffs.”
The U.S. imports about half of all aluminum it uses from other countries, mostly from neighboring Canada. The International Trade Administration reports that there’s been a significant increase of U.S. imports on aluminum, up 25% from 2015 to 2022. 
Earlier in February, Trump threatened to impose a 25% tariff on most Canadian and Mexican imports, though he later decided to pause the tariffs for 30 days after negotiations with each country. 
Trump also issued a 10% tariff on China which remains in place. The President said he will also charge retaliatory tariffs on other countries.

Promising review: ""This is by far my favorite essence. I started using it a year ago and I still order it to this day. The texture of my skin has improved significantly. It helped a lot with my acne scars from all the pimple popping. The spray can be a little weird as it sprays a lot in one area. Just two sprays are enough for my face (and I have a big one) and I just massage it around with clean hands. It doesn't really have a scent and it hasn't caused any irritation, thankfully."" —Jacqueline Orantes

Promising review: ""Not any of the many I’ve tried throughout my life have worked as incredibly as this one has. I’ve had top recommended brand cleansers that required two washes to thoroughly cleanse it all off. Not with this one. And the scent is wonderful!! I love it even more for that! The size of the bottle is much bigger than I expected and for such a great price!! Highly recommended!"" —Carlos

This lip oil is vegan, cruelty-free, and has no parabens, sulfates, or phthalates.
Promising review: ""This is the first lip oil I've ever used. Usually I avoid anything with oil because I have very sensitive and generally oilier skin, but I wanted to give this a try because I wanted something sheer and pretty for a natural makeup look. Probably the best purchase I've ever made!!! It's super sheer and looks fine on its own without any other makeup. The smell is delicious, and while the gloss dries and fades after about an hour or two without eating, the color stays all day! I did have to reapply after eating, but not after drinking water! I just wish it was bigger, it's a teeny bottle. Would definitely buy again!!"" —Debby Gold

Promising review: ""Everyone needs this lip gloss in their lives. It honestly makes your lips feel so good. I have one with my makeup and one in my purse to take everywhere with me. It's glossy but not sticky. It feels light on, but makes your lips instantly feel more nourished. Worth every penny."" —Britney Badger

All Cosrx products are dermatologist-tested, cruelty-free, and have no parabens, sulfates, or phthalates.
Promising review: ""After hours of exhaustive research on Korean gentle cleansers, I finally decided upon a cleanser. This was one of the best decisions I have ever made for my face! I have sensitive, combination, and very volatile skin, so if I ever make it unhappy, it definitely lets me know. This cleanser is light enough that it doesn't feel thick or cloying, it has a very subtle smell (which I love), and the ph of the cleanser is so low that the only thing I am worried about for my face anymore is the ph of the water I am splashing on my face. It hasn't caused any bad breakouts or negative reactions like drying or tightness of skin but it can certainly handle itself in the department of a full face cleanser. This has caused me to look forward to trying more Cosrx products!"" —Haley Hart

The snail mucin is obtained in a safe way, so no snails are harmed!
Promising review: ""I’ve been using this morning and night for about two weeks and I can say I understand the hype! My skin looks better than it has in so long. Firstly, the texture surprised me. When you think snail mucin, you think slimy and gross. This wasn’t sticky or slimy whatsoever. I was afraid it was gonna leave my skin feeling gross and slippery. Surprisingly, my skin drank it right up! No residue whatsoever and it’s a nice primer before makeup. I have oily skin and it’s helped with that as well. My skin is so soft, with a nice healthy glow. I’ve noticed my red spots from past acne is fading and my skin just overall looks great. Highly recommend!"" —Sarah Downs

BTW, a lot of reviewers say they use this as part of their double cleansing routine. As the name implies, double cleansing is a method of cleansing your face twice: first with an oil-based cleanser, and again with a water-based cleanser to help get all the yucky stuff out of your pores.
Promising review: ""This is my first time ordering an oil-based cleanser and I’m so glad I purchased this one. I originally saw this product on TikTok and wanted to see what the hype was all about. After using the cleanser on my dry face for 2–3 minutes, I could visibly see my white- and blackheads on my fingers. I was a little hesitant to try oil cleansing because I have acne-prone skin. However, my face has never looked better. After each use, my face is as soft as a baby's bottom, and my scarring doesn’t look as deep! The cleanser has a light, clean scent. Not super strong!

Promising review: ""This is definitely a miracle product. I was impressed that it worked so well, so fast, and so instantly. The packaging is silly but whimsical; I enjoy it. This is the last thing I apply before walking out the door. First day I used it, I put it on and got in my car — I looked in the rear view mirror and my heart jumped. My eyes had de-puffed on my walk down the front path!!! So impressive. It's not hydrating, it’s more tightening/brightening. If you have dry under eyes, use a creamy hydrating eye cream first, and apply this over it — problem solved. You don’t get much product, but you don’t need to use much either, and it’s not like it’s expensive. Definitely worth it if a product actually DOES what it claims it’ll do!!! Buy it!"" —Joseph S.

Promising review: ""I don't write reviews unless I am sure of my product. I have been using this eye cream at night for years. I am in my early 60's and I really don't have any wrinkles around my eyes and always get comments. I have been using eye cream since I was 12. I am a true believer in eye cream. This one is really thick but I just put it on with a Q-tip and pat in with my finger -I only use this one at night. I wouldn't recommend this for daytime just bc makeup doesn't spread well over it. Daytime should be a thinner consistency. I am an Etude House fan and use quite a few of their skin products, and I love that they are on Amazon!"" —Wendy O

""I love love love this carbonated bubble clay mask! Ok so the packaging was very cute and simple, when opening up the jar, they give you this little spatula to help spread the mask. A little bit goes a long way! The texture is jelly-like and smells decent. Once on your face, you can feel it tingling and cracking cause it's creating bubbles on your face. When done your face itself looks like a huge bubble, it's quite fascinating. I kept the mask on for 10 minutes. Afterward, I used wet hands to rub the product in, then I washed with warm water. After using this my face felt amazing! Super soft and shiny, not oily of grimy at all. Will definitely buy again, 10/10 :)"" —Erica

You don’t need a lot to wash your whole face, and it gets the job done well, leaving my face super refreshed afterward.

Promising review: ""I recommend this for dry skin rather than oily skin. When I applied it, it felt similar to applying Vaseline. However, it’s not greasy or sticky. I have dry skin and my skin absorbs the multi balm quickly. It spreads well and the area where it was applied became soft. I recommend applying it to the U-zone rather than the T-zone of the face. I mainly apply around the eyes, mouth (nasolabial folds), and neck wrinkles! In particular, immediately upon application, it had the effect of slightly tightening the skin, adding radiance, and reducing wrinkles (especially around the mouth). I think it definitely helps moisturize when I apply it after skincare, before makeup, and before going to bed."" —Ah Kim

There was no shine to my skin. I was amazed! I have bad skin. Not terrible skin but bad. Nothing helps, but this mask floored me. I can not wait to try the others. I will say the zombie mask does get quite restricting as it dries. I would do it at a time when you're not trying to talk to anyone or do much of anything. Lol It didn't smell bad. I don't really recall the smell much at all. The mask came off super easily. It took about five minutes to completely remove. I love it.

Today, in the Calculated Risk Real Estate Newsletter: Part 1: Current State of the Housing Market; Overview for mid-February 2025
A brief excerpt: This 2-part overview for mid-February provides a snapshot of the current housing market.

I always focus first on inventory, since inventory usually tells the tale!  I’m watching months-of-supply closely.
...  
New home inventory, as a percentage of total inventory, is still very high. The following graph uses Not Seasonally Adjusted (NSA) existing home inventory from the National Association of Realtors® (NAR) and new home inventory from the Census Bureau (only completed and under construction inventory).

It took a number of years following the housing bust for new home inventory to return to the pre-bubble percent of total inventory. Then, with the pandemic, existing home inventory collapsed and now the percent of new homes is 25.1% of the total for sale inventory, down from a peak of 27.2% in December 2022.

The percent of new homes of total inventory should continue to decline as existing home inventory increases. However, the percent of new home inventory has increased seasonally over the Winter as existing homes are withdrawn from the market.There is much more in the article.

23,2025-02-10,"Zotac is taking a bold step to combat GPU scalping by selling its latest RTX 50-series graphics cards including the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 directly to gamers through its official gaming Discord server. This initiative is an attempt to ensure that genuine customers have a fair chance to purchase the latest GPUs at MSRP (Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price) without interference from scalpers and bots.
To qualify, users must actively engage in the Zotac Discord community by participating in discussions, events, and challenges. Winners are then selected using a random number generator, ensuring a transparent process. Currently, the program is limited to users in the U.S., and while a limited number of RTX 5080 units are available, the RTX 5090 is not yet in stock.
Zotac has also implemented strict anti-scalping measures to prevent reselling. All GPUs sold through this program have their serial numbers recorded, and any user caught attempting to resell their GPU risks being permanently banned from future Zotac raffles and direct sales events. This zero-tolerance policy reinforces Zotac’s commitment to prioritizing real gamers over resellers.
Scalping has been a significant issue in the PC hardware market, especially new GPUs, with many high-demand products being hoarded and resold at inflated prices. By offering direct sales to active community members, Zotac is not only making it harder for scalpers but also rewarding its loyal customers with an exclusive opportunity to purchase its GPUs fairly.
While it remains to be seen how effective this strategy will be in the long run, Zotac’s approach sets an important precedent for the industry. If successful, it could encourage other manufacturers to adopt similar measures to ensure gamers, not scalpers, get their hands on the latest hardware.
Nvidia’s new RTX 50-series GPUs represent a leap forward in gaming and content creation, but they also push the boundaries of what’s expected from your power supply. The RTX 5090 and RTX 5080, will be the first two models available for purchase starting January 30, and are expected to deliver improved performance over its predecessors -- you can already see that in action in our RTX 5090 review.
However, with great power comes greater demands on your power supply. If you're planning to upgrade to either of these next-generation graphics cards, it’s crucial to know what kind of PSU (Power Supply Unit) you need. Ensuring your PSU meets or exceeds the recommended specifications is critical for avoiding crashes, ensuring system stability, and maintaining long-term reliability.
Nvidia has expressed confidence that the infamous melting issues with the 12VHPWR power connectors, which plagued some RTX 40-series GPUs, will not recur with its next-generation RTX 50-series lineup.
As reported by QuasarZone, during the Nvidia RTX AI Day 2025 event in South Korea, Nvidia representatives assured attendees that the overheating and melting issues experienced with the RTX 4090's 12VHPWR connector have been resolved in the RTX 50 series. “We don’t expect that to happen with the RTX 50 series. We made some changes to the connector to respond to the issue at the time, and we know that it is not happening now, about two years later,” said an Nvidia representative.
Nvidia's RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 are set to release later this month, and there's no doubt that they'll end up being some of the best graphics cards of the year. Unfortunately, it also seems that they might be hard to come by, as many sources expect that the RTX 50-series will have very limited availability to start with.  If this checks out, we might see a similar situation to the GPU shortage we endured during the launch of the RTX 30-series.
VideoCardz compiled a number of leaks that all add up to the same thing: Nvidia and its partners may not be able to supply many next-gen GPUs in time for the launch date. This wouldn't necessarily mean that the official January 30 release date would get pushed -- that's pretty unlikely at this point. Instead, the GPUs might be up for sale, but limited in number, and they won't be restocked for some time.

Bitcoin's price dropped below $100,000 on Feb. 4, as concerns over the global trade war between the United States and China affected market sentiment. The U.S. announced new tariffs on Chinese imports, creating uncertainty that pushed Bitcoin's price down and led to fears of a large liquidation event. If Bitcoin fails to hold its key $93,000 support level, analysts warn it could trigger liquidations of up to $1.3 billion in leveraged long positions across all crypto exchanges.
Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget Research, highlighted that Bitcoin's short-term prospects depend on its ability to maintain support at the $93,000 level. A fall below $90,500 could signal a bearish trend, which would likely worsen market sentiment. These price levels are seen as crucial in determining Bitcoin's near-term future. However, some analysts believe that Bitcoin's drop could be temporary, given its history as a hedge against traditional finance volatility.
James Wo, CEO of DFG, explained that while the trade tensions between the U.S. and China may create immediate downward pressure on Bitcoin, the situation could eventually drive demand for Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. A weakened dollar due to trade disputes might push investors toward Bitcoin, which was originally designed to serve as a store of value and an alternative to fiat currencies. As inflation rises and confidence in traditional currencies decreases, Bitcoin's appeal as a decentralized asset could increase.
The ongoing trade war has created significant volatility, and market participants are waiting for President Donald Trump's upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, scheduled for Feb. 11. However, reports surfaced on Feb. 4 that the meeting had been delayed, adding to the uncertainty surrounding the situation. The trade tensions between the two largest economies in the world could have far-reaching consequences for global markets, including the cryptocurrency market.
The market’s mood is currently bearish, reflected in the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, which has dropped to a “Fear” score of 46, down from 60 the previous week. This negative sentiment could dampen retail investment, while professional investors remain cautiously optimistic. Many are watching how Bitcoin responds to the current market conditions, particularly concerning the impact of the trade war and possible tariffs.
At the time of writing, Bitcoin's price is hovering around $96,081. If it can hold its ground and avoid further decline below $93,000, Bitcoin may still see a rebound. However, it faces a challenging road ahead, as global economic factors and trade tensions continue to weigh on its short-term outlook.

27,2025-02-10,"Shares of GameStop (GME+8.57%) jumped over 8% Monday afternoon on speculation that the brick-and-mortar company may invest in Bitcoin. 
Over the weekend, the video game retailer’s CEO, Ryan Cohen, shared a photo of himself with Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy (MSTR+1.41%) (formerly MicroStrategy) and the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. GameStop was trading at $26 per share on Monday.
The photo was posted on X without a caption or any details about their meeting, sparking speculation that GameStop might be exploring opportunities related to Bitcoin. 
The relationship between Bitcoin and meme stocks like GameStop is not new. The entire GameStop saga of 2021 significantly impacted the cryptocurrency market. 
In January 2021, a group of small retail investors teamed up to collectively take advantage of GameStop’s low share price. Financial analysts — including Keith Gill, who is known as Roaring Kitty on YouTube and DeepFuckingValue on Reddit — argued that the GameStop stock is undervalued and over-shorted.
Soon after, R/wallstreetbets recorded a record-breaking 73 million page views in just 24 hours. By January 29, 2021, the community had grown to 6 million users, making it the fastest-growing subreddit of all time, and the social media platform had to temporarily close the subreddit to the public because of hateful speech and discriminatory content. The GameStop saga was so intriguing that it was the subject of a feature film, “Dumb Money,” in 2023.
In addition to stocks, cryptocurrencies were also influenced by meme stock mania. On Reddit, investors discussed what cryptocurrency was the equivalent to GameStop — and their conclusion was Dogecoin. On Feb 4, 2021, Elon Musk tweeted a single word on Twitter: Doge. Crypto enthusiasts and the media took note, and Dogecoin’s price surged dramatically. In addition to Dogecoin, Bitcoin experienced a significant rise, reaching a new peak of approximately $64,000 by mid-April.

Investing.com - McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) comparable sales topped average analyst estimates in the fourth quarter, as the burger giant's international licensed markets business was boosted by strength in the Middle East and Japan.
In the three months ended on December 31, global comparable sales expanded by 0.4%, decelerating from 3.4% in the year-ago period, as the business was hit by weaker demand in the U.S.
But the uptick was better than analysts' expectations for a decline of 0.93%, Bloomberg consensus forecasts showed.
Same-store sales at its international developmental licensed markets climbed by 4.1%, surpassing growth of 0.7% a year ago and projections for a drop of 0.38%. Performance at the segment was led by the Middle East and Japan, McDonald's noted.
In a statement, CEO Chris Kempczinski said the business, which has recently joined other fast-food chains in offering more lower-priced options to attract consumers, is focused on providing ""outstanding value"" and ""exciting menu innovation.""
McDonald's has been pushing to address a dent to guest count and sales sparked by an E. coli outbreak last year that infected dozens of people and killed at least one person, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Kempczinski has apologized for the outbreak, adding that he was ""confident"" in the safety of the group's food. Executives have also said they are moving to ""restor[e] consumer confidence"" and get its U.S. business back to showing ""strong momentum.""
Group-wide, revenue for the fourth quarter slipped by 0.3% year-on-year to $6.39 billion, compared with expectations of $6.45 billion. Operating income edged up by 2.4% to $2.87 billion.
For the full year, operating profit increased by 1% to $11.71 billion despite McDonald's booking a pre-tax expense of $221 million related to restructuring charges.
Shares in McDonald's rose by more than 1% in premarket U.S. trading on Monday.

30,2025-02-10,"A cybersecurity company is warning businesses and organizations not to use a popular app from the generative AI company DeepSeek, saying that the program contains a number of security vulnerabilities that could compromise users’ data.
The DeepSeek app, which shocked the stock market when it moved to the top of the Apple App Store in January, transmits data unencrypted over the internet and insecurely stores usernames, passwords, and other credentials, according to an analysis by mobile app security firm NowSecure.
The vulnerabilities the firm found affect the mobile app through which many users access DeepSeek’s AI models, not the models themselves, which can also be run locally on a user’s device or through a separate hosting platform.
“Because mobile apps change quickly and are a largely unprotectedÂ attack surface, they present a very real risk to companies and consumers,” NowSecure wrote. “DeepSeek is high profile, but not unique.”
Analyzing the DeepSeek app’s performance on real phones, NowSecure found that the iPhone version came with an important security feature designed by Apple turned off.
“The DeepSeek iOS app globally disables App Transport Security (ATS) which is an iOS platform level protection that prevents sensitive data from being sent over unencrypted channels,” the analysts wrote. “Since this protection is disabled, the app can (and does) send unencrypted data over the internet. ”
The lack of encryption could make users susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks, where someone with control over the network on which the device is communicating is able to view or modify communications between the user and DeepSeek’s servers.
NowSecure also found that in some instances the DeepSeek app was caching sensitive information, including username and password, in an unencrypted file on the device that could potentially be reviewed by an attacker who gained physical or remote access to the device.
Other vulnerabilities NowSecure identified are more common among mobile apps. For example, the analysts determined that DeepSeek collects a variety of data about the network and device the app is operating on that can be combined with other information and used by data brokers, or potentially even more nefarious actors, to track and monitor a user.
The NowSecure report comes as several governments are banning their employees from using DeepSeek due to security vulnerabilities and the fact that the company is based in China.
On Monday, New York Governor Kathy Hochul announced that state employees were barred from using DeepSeek’s models on their devices.
Congress is currently considering a bill that would implement a similar ban at the federal level, and the governments of South Korea, Australia, and Taiwan have already blocked access to DeepSeek’s models on official devices.

Mark asks:
The Trump administration has said they will be new tariffs placed on goods and materials from China and he has plans to halt some trade exemptions. Since most phones are made from Chinese sourced parts, how is this going to affect prices? Should we be worried?
Hi Mark! this is an excellent and timely question that I think a lot of people have, even if they don't understand how any of it works.

I'm no economist, but I know a bit about manufacturing and have looked into this myself; I'm concerned about it, too. The quick answer for anyone who doesn't want to read the whole article: tariffs and other trade restrictions will make prices go up. It won't be some sort of doomsday situation where even a basic phone costs thousands of dollars, but the companies that make phones will have increased costs and likely have to deal with new restrictions placed by China in retaliation. All of these increases (and a bit more) will be passed on to customers.

To try and understand what might happen, you need to know what a tariff is. It's a tax placed on goods that are imported from other countries. Companies that send products to the United States pay these taxes to the government before their goods are allowed into the country.
If an overseas company sends goods that are valued at $10 each, they would be charged $1 per item with a 10% tariff. Usually, these fees are passed along to the company buying the imported products, so instead of paying $10 each, that company now pays $11 each.
There have always been tariffs and levies in place, and you've always been paying for them because they are built into the cost of a product. When those tariffs are increased, the fees will trickle down to you, and you'll pay more.
Most countries have what's known as a De Minimis Value when it comes to imported goods. De Minimis is a Latin phrase that means something is so insignificant that it can be ignored, and a country decides what that value is.
In the U.S., the De Minimis Value threshold is $800. In Canada, it's USD 20. In Australia, it's USD 1,000. It can vary a lot, and it's a way for countries to help balance trading fees with consumer costs. It also means most phones built and assembled in China don't have extra duty fees because their original value is far less than USD 800.
The current U.S. administration is considering nullifying the current De Minimis exemptions, so a 10% tariff on all goods coming from China, even ones that were currently under $800 in value and exempt, will now be levied. This would be a direct-to-consumer increase on things like phones that are built in and shipped directly from China.
These costs all trickle down to the consumer, too.

I don't think this is as alarming as headlines like to make it sound. I don't think it is a smart move (did I mention that I'm not an economist?), but I can't see the sky falling and people fighting over loaves of bread in some apocalyptic nightmare scenario. The cheap consumer goods you love to buy are simply going to cost a little more.
The real impact will be on shareholders in the companies importing and selling these products. A 10% tariff on your next phone could mean you'll pay $20 more for it, but 10% of 10 million is a lot of money when it's all added up.
The initial reactions are not great — stock prices are falling and the market is down over 400 points (as of last week) over fears and anxiety about the proposed trade law changes. It could steady itself, or it could get worse. One certain thing is that the executives from these companies have a lot to say about it and are in positions where their voices make a difference.
You and I complain that a new phone costs a little more. The execs at Qualcomm or Apple complain too, but the difference is that their complaints are to people who can make changes. Those government officials will listen, too. They love having big tech companies in their area and will do plenty of favors and pull a lot of strings to ensure the tech giants get what they want. Is it fair? Nope. It's simply the reality of how U.S. capitalism works.
These tech giants — even companies like Samsung, which don't import as many things from China — will react if when anything that affects their bottom line happens. They know there is a limit to how much they can increase consumer prices, and when it is reached, any other fees and costs of doing business come from their coffers.
Love it or hate it, big business controls the economy in the United States and will look out for its best interests. This time, one of their interests (lower costs) aligns with ours.
One last thing I want to mention — you might already be seeing companies talk about how they have to increase prices because of these new trade laws. Remember that they haven't paid anything extra yet and are raising prices on goods they already have.

T-Mobile is targeting cell ""dead zones"" by offering satellite connectivity with Starlink for iPhone and Android users.

        The network used an ad during the Super Bowl on Sunday night to launch the beta version of the satellite-to-cell service, which it said would also be available for customers of its competitors Verizon and AT&T.
    

        CEO Mike Sievert said in a press release that T-Mobile Starlink would automatically connect to compatible devices with no cellular coverage. He described it as ""a massive technical achievement and an absolute game changer for all wireless users.""
    

        Starlink, part of Elon Musk's SpaceX, provides coverage from satellites. T-Mobile said users would be able to send and receive text messages in areas not covered by mobile towers on the ground. It added that about half a million square miles of the US lacked cell coverage — an area about twice as big as Texas.
    

        T-Mobile said data and voice-call coverage would follow later.
    

        It said the Starlink service would be free until July for some testers. After that, it said, T-Mobile customers on the Go5G Next plan will continue to have free service, while those on other plans will be charged $15 a month, or $10 if they sign up before the end of this month. Customers on other networks would be charged $20 a month.
    

        Mobile networks providing similar satellite coverage in conjunction with Starlink include Rogers in Canada, KDDI in Japan, Telstra and Optus in Australia, Salt in Switzerland, and Kyivstar in Ukraine.
    

        Data from Cloudflare indicates Starlink traffic tripled in 2024 after the service expanded to countries including Chad, Mongolia, and Argentina.
    

        Several airlines offer Starlink, including United, Air France, and Qatar.
    

        Elon Musk donated Starlink terminals to Los Angeles when the city was battling wildfires in January.
    

        T-Mobile shares rose by 4% in premarket trading in New York. The stock has risen by more than 50% over the past year, valuing the company at more than $280 billion.

Welcome back! President Donald Trump said that he plans to impose 25% tariffs today on imports of steel and aluminum. Gold hit a record high following the news, while some related currencies softened against the dollar. 

        In today's big story, Meta employees impacted by its performance-based cuts are getting notified today.
    

What's on deck


Markets: Palantir and retail investors are a match made in heaven.
    

Tech: Consulting executives told us the prompts they use to get the most out of AI.
    

Business: The billionaire heirs desperate to give away their money.
    

        But first, a ""reduction of force.""
    

If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.


The day after the Super Bowl is always tough at work, but it's about to be particularly hard for some Meta employees.


        Today Meta is starting to notify workers impacted by its performance-based job cuts. Less than a month ago, CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees the tech giant was firing 5% of its entire workforce to speed up how quickly it got rid of low performers. (He wasn't that blunt, but the point stands.)
    

        Business Insider's Jyoti Mann got the internal memo detailing how the cuts will work. When it's all said and done, some 4,000 Meta workers are expected to be shown the door.
    

        Jyoti, Pranav Dixit, and Hugh Langley spoke to some employees about the vibes inside Meta leading up to the cuts — ""feels like living in a George Orwell novel,"" one worker said — along with how they play into Meta's broader reorganization efforts.
    

        The layoffs come as Meta has made some other seismic shifts. From overhauling its content moderation system and nixing DEI programs to doubling its investment in AI, Meta hasn't wasted time in what Zuckerberg has said will be an ""intense year.""
    

        Coincidentally, Meta employees are having their own issues with content moderation. Some workers have questioned Meta's removal of posts and comments from its internal forum. Meta's Community Engagement Expectations restrict mocking protected categories like race, but some employees accused the tech giant of censoring valid discussions.
    

        Internal drama isn't the only problem Meta is facing. The fight for AI dominance is heating up and getting more expensive. Meta expects its capital expenditure to be as high as $65 billion this year, about double what it spent in 2022.
    

        Meta's push for open-source AI models also contradicts what some of its competitors are doing, which could either boost it or backfire.
    
A jump in delinquencies in a corner of the mortgage market suggests first-time homebuyers may be struggling.
1. Palantir + retail investors = big returns. CEO Alex Karp doesn't fit the Wall Street mold, so it's not surprising his approach to investors doesn't either. Instead of the IPO route, Palantir went for a direct listing, and — during earnings calls — Karp often prioritizes retail investor questions. These mom-and-pop investors are reaping the rewards, with the stock up more than 47% this year.
2. The White House's opening pro-crypto move. AI and crypto czar David Sacks announced on Tuesday that the Trump administration has prioritized a federal stablecoins bill. Stablecoins, which are cryptos pegged to fiat currencies, could help ensure US dollar dominance, a crypto expert told BI. That's because about 98% of the stablecoins are tied to the greenback.
3. The investor gold rush amid Trump-era policies. Trump's administration has spurred trade and geopolitical uncertainty, so investors are flocking to the yellow metal as a safe haven. Gold hit a record high today after Trump on Sunday threatened steel and aluminum tariffs. Ahead of Trump's comments, IGN said it had expected gold to reach $3,000 an ounce this quarter.

1. Rise of the (VC-backed) robots. A few startups are building autonomous robots, with some US companies securing up to $150 million in funding. The robots use AI and spatial intelligence to do everything from making coffee to helping with surgery. BI found 12 businesses to watch.
    

2. X has a new adtech partner. Elon Musk's company is working with Magnite, a supply-side platform that helps publishers manage and sell advertising. X has been working to reverse the losses it took when many advertisers left the platform in 2022, though Musk's beef with them is still going strong.
    

3. How McKinsey and the Big Four use AI. BI asked execs at five big consulting firms — McKinsey, PwC, KPMG, EY, and Deloitte — their best tips for using AI in everyday work. They told us their favorite prompts and advice for getting the most out of the tech.
    

1. These wealthy heirs want to divest — from themselves. One conference is helping rich — and mostly young — people grapple with their identities and redistribute their funds to causes that matter. The up-and-coming millionaires and billionaires are also finding community (albeit a small one) along the way.
    

2. Are we making eggs-cuses for all these price hikes? Most people know that egg prices have skyrocketed lately, in part because bird flu has decimated the egg-laying hen population. But when customers are primed to expect price hikes, some retailers can hike prices beyond what's really necessary. Are retailers surcharging to stay afloat, or is there a bit of fowl play at work?
    

3. RTO FAQs. If you're one of the tens of thousands of Americans recently affected by an order to return to the office, fear not. BI has assembled a guide to help you prepare, including commute planning and deciding what to wear.

The future looked grim in mid-2022 for Minneapolis-based Sezzle, an also-ran in the fast-growing buy-now, pay-later fintech business. It had burned through most of the $115 million it had raised in a 2019 initial public offering on the Australian stock market and two subsequent offerings. A rescue deal it had struck to be acquired by a competitor was collapsing, along with both companies’ stock prices. And when tiny Sezzle tried to sign up big retailers, it had to make too many concessions to ever turn a profit—a problem because the typical buy-now, pay-later transaction, which allows online shoppers to pay for purchases in four installments at 0% interest, relies on subsidies from merchants.

Meanwhile, investor enthusiasm for money-losing fintechs, which surged during the early days of the pan­demic, was evaporating. Venture capital fun­ding for the sector fell from a rec­ord $141 billion worldwide in 2021 to $39 billion in 2023, per CB Insights.
“We were reaching a tech-pocalypse with interest rates rising, and [investors were] thinking ‘We’ve got to look at the fundamentals of companies,’ and our fundamentals were not great,” remembers Charlie Youakim, Sezzle’s 47-year-old CEO and cofounder.
To survive, he started chopping. He shuttered the company’s operations in Europe, India and Brazil, cut worldwide staff from 580 to 240 and began shedding unfavorable partnerships. He even trimmed headcount in the U.S.—the heart of Sezzle’s business—by 10% and made symbolic changes like canceling the $500-a-month contract for a fancy Bevi machine that dispensed carbonated and flavored water at headquarters.
Up against much bigger and better-funded competitors such as San Francisco-based Affirm and Sweden’s Klarna, Youakim couldn’t simply cut his way to survival, let alone profitability. He needed a new revenue source and strategy. He found both by focusing on the niche of heavy users, chronic buy-now, pay-later addicts.
In 2022, Sezzle launched a $12.99-a-month subscription service aimed at these frequent fliers, with benefits including access to more retailers and flexibility in rescheduling payments. Those opting for the premium “Sezzle Anywhere” (introduced in June 2023) pay $17.99 a month and can use 0% installment buying at physical stores and restaurants too by loading a virtual Visa card onto their phones. In all, Sezzle has 529,000 subscribers.
That $17.99 monthly charge works out to $216 a year. That’s expensive when a host of credit cards charge no annual fees and pay cash back on all purchases. But many buy-now, pay-later users don’t qualify for the best credit card deals. A recent study by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that most buy-now, pay-later loans are made to borrowers with subprime credit scores and that heavy users are more likely than other Americans to have outstanding student and personal loans, in addition to their credit card balances. Three-quarters of Sezzle’s users are Gen Z or Millennials.
Here’s another way to look at Sezzle’s offering, which gets mixed user reviews online. Credit cards now carry an average annual interest rate of 21.5% (though people with low credit scores typically pay more). Using that average, $216 is roughly the interest someone carrying a constant $1,000 balance on a credit card would pay in a year. Sezzle won’t disclose the average outstan­ding balance subscribers have. (Surprisingly, it doesn’t even give subscribers a credit limit; each purchase is approved individually, the company says.) It’s safe to say $216 is a steep price for infrequent users, but for the heaviest users of Sezzle Anywhere—the top 10% make an average of 10 transactions each month—it may be worth it.
With subscriptions bringing in a growing share of revenue—33% in the third quarter of 2024—Sezzle has been profitable for more than two years. For the first nine months of 2024, it reported $53 million of net income ($8.94 a share on a diluted basis) on 57% growth in revenue to $173 million. By contrast, Affirm, which went public in January 2021, lost $279 million on $1.9 billion in revenue during the same nine months. Klarna, which is preparing for a U.S. initial public offering, lost $10 million in the first nine months on $1.8 billion in sales and is finally turning quarterly profits. It started its own subscription service in the U.S. last year.
Both champions and skeptics have taken notice. Sezzle’s stock, which listed on Nasdaq in August 2023, shot up 2,000% during the first 11 months of 2024. It has fallen 44% since, including 23% on December 18, when short-seller Hindenburg Research issued a report savaging Sezzle as a “failing” platform that had “already been left in the dust” by bigger competitors and “reported rosy numbers using short-term tricks.” Its stock recently traded around $240 a share, for a total market cap of $1.3 billion, making Youakim’s 44% stake worth nearly $600 million.
As Hindenburg points out, Sezzle’s merchant roster has declined by more than half since 2021 to 23,000, while its active customer count is down 20% to 2.7 million. “You should not be focused on keeping active customer accounts high at the sake of financial performance. I call them vanity metrics. The real metrics that matter are performance metrics,” Youakim says, pointing to Sezzle’s growth in sales and profits.
This isn’t Youakim’s first startup. Minnesota-born and -bred (his father is a Palestinian immigrant), he graduated in 1999 from the University of Minnesota with a degree in mechanical engineering and a knack for coding. He spent his 20s working for a parking software company before heading back to the University of Minnesota in 2008 for an MBA. Graduating in the wake of the Great Recession, he found job prospects limited and started Passport, his own mobile parking payments company, in Charlotte, North Carolina, with a cousin. The company was successful, but the cousins butted heads. Youakim was pushed out at the end of 2015.
Wanting to stay in payments, in 2016 he founded Sezzle with Paul Paradis, a business school buddy who wanted to stay in Minnesota. They raised $1.8 million in a seed round and in 2017 launched a product that aimed to lower transaction costs for merchants. When that fell flat, Youakim drew inspiration from Afterpay, an Australian-born buy-now, pay-later startup. (Afterpay entered the U.S. market in 2018 and was bought by Block in 2022.)
With Afterpay, Affirm and Klarna already in the field, VCs weren’t interested in backing Sezzle. So Youakim sold his stake in Passport to Bain Capital Ventures for about $12 million (a “massive discount,” he says) and invested $8 million of it into his new company—after taxes, that’s basically all he had. An analyst suggested he do a roadshow in Australia, where it’s more common to go public at early stages, leading to a $30 million 2019 IPO.
Despite being public, Sezzle was way behind its rivals. By 2019, Affirm had already raised $1.1 billion in debt and equity at a valuation of $2.9 billion. Plus, it had buzz—it was run by Max Levchin, a PayPal cofounder, making him an O.G. member of the PayPal mafia, along with Silicon Valley royalty Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and Reid Hoffman. (Affirm’s current market cap is $18 billion; Levchin owns 10%.)
In 2020, Youakim made his first bid to distinguish Sezzle from larger players with an optional free service allowing users to have their loan payments reported to the credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) to help build their credit history. Buy-now, pay-later lenders haven’t traditionally reported to the bureaus, and reporting could even lower a consumer’s score if it looked like they were taking out lots of personal loans. Sezzle’s solution is to aggregate a user’s transactions for each month and report it as a single revolving line of credit (like a credit card).
Credit reporting wasn’t enough to differentiate Sezzle. By February 2022, it was running short of cash again. Sezzle’s stock had tanked 80% in a year to $2 a share amid rising bad debts and assertions by a local fund manager that it was hiding negative information. That’s when Sezzle agreed to be bought for $300 million by Australian competitor Zip—a deal that fell apart five months later.
One current issue flagged by Hindenburg: The push for subscribers has caused Sezzle’s customers’ default rates to rise from 1.2% in 2022 to 2.3% in the third quarter last year. Youkaim waves this off as a natural consequence of growth. It’s worth noting that buy-now, pay-later users have much lower default rates on these loans than on their credit cards because lenders like Sezzle require that borrowers set up automatic repayments—either from their bank accounts or through charges to their credit cards. In other words, the buy-now, pay-later companies buck some of the default risk to the credit card issuers.
Hindenburg, which ceased operations in January, raised other issues with Sezzle. One is that Youakim has pledged the majority of his stake (some 1.7 million shares, worth around $400 million) as collateral for a margin loan. Youakim insists that what he has actually borrowed is a tiny fraction of that and that he simply wanted a little personal liquidity since he has never sold a share. He has been as frugal personally as professionally, he says. He doesn’t own a car in Minnesota, walking two and a half miles each way most days to Sezzle’s office, and still lives in the same home he’s owned since he started the company, though he spends most of the winter in Puerto Rico. He chose the Sezzle name—a mashup of sell and sizzle—in part because its domain name was cheap.
After spending just $4.4 million on marketing and advertising in the first nine months of 2024, Sezzle is loosening its purse strings a bit. In August it agreed to spend more than $5 million annually for three years to have the Sezzle name and rainbow-hued logo patched onto Minnesota Timberwolves players’ basketball jerseys. The sponsorship deal also comes with four courtside seats at every home game to entertain partners and investors.
”We knew it was time for us to do something a little bit splashier,” says Youakim’s cofounder Para­dis, who worked in sales for the Timberwolves in his first job out of college and oversees Sezzle’s marketing strategy as its president. He points to competitors’ efforts—Klarna, Afterpay and Affirm have done billboards, and Klarna bought a Super Bowl ad.
Timberwolves superstar Anthony Edwards looms on a billboard outside the franchise’s Target Center with his Sezzle patch prominently displayed. After the team surprised many with its best season in decades last year, the NBA rewarded it with 25 national TV games this season, up from just 10 a year ago.
“We’re not a regional player,” Youakim says. “We’re looking for national impressions.”

Asian markets, except for Hong Kong and Mainland China, were lower on Trump’s steel and aluminum tariff talk as the U.S. dollar strengthened overnight.
AI continues to fuel Hong Kong and Mainland China’s growth and technology rally, though Trump’s reversal on banning the U.S. Postal Service’s delivery of China packages was a positive. Maybe the U.S. and China are further along in trade talks than the market is anticipating? This could be the reason behind the strength of Hong Kong-listed stocks against a clear negative, i.e. tariffs.
Alibaba gained +5.5% as Alibaba Cloud announced the integration of several DeepSeek models into its platform. Hong Kong had very strong volume and strong breadth, i.e. advancers versus decliners, which technical analysts would love, led by Alibaba’s value of volume, which was 4X pre-stimulus levels, though Tencent gained +2.06% and Meituan gained +5.58%, which had very high volume as well. Alibaba, along with the Hong Kong Tracker ETF and Hang Seng China Enterprise ETF, had very strong net buying via Southbound Stock Connect, as total buying from the Mainland into Hong Kong across all securities totaled $2.11 billion, accounting for 48% of Hong Kong turnover.
With Alibaba’s Hong Kong-listed shares, 4.8% are now held by Mainland investors via Southbound Stock Connect since its September 2024 addition to the mutual market access program. Year-to-date, Mainland investors have bought a net $18.87 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs via Southbound Connect.
To gauge where we are in the rally, YTD, 3 of the 4 largest U.S.-listed China ETFs are net sells. Out of sight of out mind, I suppose.
Hong Kong-listed Chinese telecom stocks had a good day as they are seen as AI beneficiaries while insurance was off.
Dongfeng Motor Group gained +25.7% and Chongqing Changan Auto gained +6.1% after the companies’ parent companies filed for restructuring, leading to speculation of a merger between the two. The filing is leading to what some believe is a wave of M&A activity that could sweep through the industry against the backdrop of overcapacity.
January’s PPI and CPI releases were non-factors, as the former was -2.3% versus expectations of -2.2% and December’s -2.3% and the latter was up +0.5% versus expectations of +0.4% and December’s +0.1%. Chinese New Year vacation spending was viewed as CPI’s catalyst.
The Mainland animal spirits are not quite as strong as in Hong Kong, though growth stocks and small caps were higher overnight, led by semiconductors, metals, telecom, software and media stocks. Mainland financial media noted that Mainland-listed bond ETFs’ AUM has grown to RMB 200 billion from RMB 100 billion in just nine months.
The Western media narrative continues to be so negative on China, which may explain the lack of ETF flows noted above. Most investors would guess China is down -50% YoY and not closer to up +50%! Technical analysts continue to note that the occurrence of ever higher highs and higher lows is a called an uptrend.
The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes gained +1.84% and +2.65%, respectively, on volume that decreased -1.57% from Friday, which is 175% of the 1-year average. 314 stocks advanced while 168 stocks declined. Main Board short turnover increased +23.5% from Friday, which is 200% of the 1-year average, as 18% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). The growth factor and large caps outpaced the value factor and small caps. The top-performing sectors were Consumer Discretionary, which gained +3.55%, Materials, which gained +2.35%, and Technology, which gained +2.19%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Energy, which fell -0.13%, and Utilities, which fell -0.33%. The top-performing subsectors were consumer staples distribution, consumer discretionary distribution, and healthcare equipment. Meanwhile, household & personal products, coal, and electrical equipment were among the worst-performing. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were very high as Mainland investors bought a net $2.11 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, including Alibaba, the Hong Kong Tracker ETF, the Hang Seng China Enterprise ETF, which were large net buys, Xiaomi, Meituan and China Mobile, Tencent, and Semiconductor Manufacturing.
Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board gained +0.56%, +1.08%, and +1.76%, respectively, on volume that declined -11.65% from Friday, which is 157% of the 1-year average. 3,887 stocks advanced while 1,016 declined. The value factor and large caps gained more than the growth factor and small caps. The top-performing sectors were Communication Services, which gained +1.91%, Information Technology, which gained +0.71%, and Health Care, which gained +0.5%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Utilities, which fell -0.77%, Energy, which fell -0.70%, and Industrials, which fell -0.65%. The top-performing subsectors were internet, education, and telecom. Meanwhile, soft drinks, motorcycles, and marine & shipping industry were among the worst-performing subsectors. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were just above average. CNY and the Asia Dollar Index both posted small losses versus the US dollar. Treasury bonds fell. Copper rose and steel fell.

While the impact of the tariff on the world economy is yet to be seen, investors are also focused on the inflation report that is set to be released this week, which will provide insight into how the Trump administration plans to tackle the macroeconomic situation.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed by 1.1% Monday afternoon, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 saw increases of 0.2% and 0.6%, respectively.
Additionally, investors will focus on major corporate earnings this week, including Coca-Cola (KO+0.50%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI+15.49%), Robinhood (HOOD+0.88%), Coinbase (COIN+2.07%), and others.
 Trump said Sunday that he plans to announce a blanket 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports. In response to the announcement, stocks for steel and aluminum companies saw significant increases on Monday, such as Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF+17.38%), U.S. Steel (X+3.63%), and Nucor (NUE+5.73%). In the commodity market, HRC Steel Futures Continuous Contract was up 6%.
The fast-food giant McDonald’s (MCD+4.89%) missed Wall Street’s expectations for the fourth quarter, largely due to the lingering effects of an E. coli outbreak and ongoing inflation pressures. The October incident sickened hundreds of customers and caused a massive drop in foot traffic, leading to a decline in same-store sales. McDonald’s shares were up by 4% Monday afternoon.
Shares of GameStop (GME+8.57%) jumped over 8% Monday afternoon on speculation that the brick-and-mortar company may invest in Bitcoin.
Over the weekend, the video game retailer’s CEO, Ryan Cohen, shared a photo of himself with Michael Saylor, co-founder of Strategy (MSTR+1.41%) (formerly MicroStrategy) and the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. GameStop was trading at $26 per share on Monday.
The photo was posted on X without a caption or any details about their meeting, sparking speculation that GameStop might be exploring opportunities related to Bitcoin.

(last update: 2019-10-02)


I frequently say that advertising is a cancer on modern society. This view is met
with various reactions, including requests for a more detailed explanation. In this post,
I first explain why I believe the cancer analogy is apt, then continue with a nonexhaustive
list of observable symptoms of this disease, and end with some final thoughts. This post
is a living document, updated over time, and intended to be linked to.


(When I say ""advertising"", I use this term somewhat loosely; this text applies not
just to the advertising material presented to customers, but to the broader process surrounding
its creation as well, which is more correctly referred to via a bunch of buzzwords
grouped under the term ""marketing"".)


Cancer is a family of diseases sharing some common characteristics. Cancer cells abandon their
normal cooperative role in a body, and instead start to replicate uncontrollably, engaging
in complex behaviors not just to avoid getting killed off by immune system, but to actually
convince the body to give them access to more and more resources.


Advertising as currently practiced shares these characteristics. It's a malignant mutation of an idea
that efficient markets need a way to connect goods and services with people wanting to buy them.
Limited to honestly informing people about what's available on the market, it can serve
a crucial function in enabling trade. In the real world however, it's moved way past that role.


Real world advertising is not about informing, it's about convincing. Over time, it became
increasingly manipulative and dishonest. It also became more effective. In the process, it grew
to consume a significant amount of resources of every company on the planet. It infected every
communication medium in existence, both digital and analog. It shapes every product and service
you touch, and it affects your interactions with everyone who isn't your close friend
or family member. Through all that, it actively destroys trust in people and institutions alike,
and corrupts the decision-making process in any market transaction. It became a legitimized form
of industrial-scale psychological abuse, and there's no way you can resist its impact.


The growth of advertising is fueled by the enormous waste it creates. In any somewhat
saturated market - which, today, is most of them - any effort you spent on advertising serves
primarily to counteract the combined advertising efforts of your competitors. The same results
could be achieved if every market player limited themselves to just informing customers about
their goods and services. This, unfortunately, is impossible for humanity, and so we end up
with a zero-sum game instead (or really negative-sum, if you count the externalities). If you have
competitors, you can't not participate.


Tallying up: uncontrolled growth? Check. Destructive consequences? Check. Hard to kill?
Check. Co-opts resources? Check. Advertising has the characteristics of cancer.


This list is nonexhaustive and will be updated over time, as I encounter more interesting
examples of advertising inconveniencing or hurting people.


The obvious one and a hot topic now. Adtech industry is solely responsible for creating and
deploying the most advanced surveillance system ever seen in history. Something far beyond
even the wildest dreams of the Stasi, NSA, or Orwell himself. The infrastructure is ready
and works today. You interact with it every time you go on-line, and increasingly off-line
as well. From being subject to face recognition when going for a pizza, through
your headphones recording and sending out what you listen to, your phone telling on you as you walk through the mall,
your TV knowing about what's going on in your house, to your car spying on you as you drive,
it's almost impossible to escape being surveilled now.  There's really nothing stopping
any government from tapping into this total surveillance infrastructure other than lack of will.
All they need to do is ask, and while your country may not care today, it might start after the
next terror attack (or news-about-terror induced panic).


(Ironically, what governments currently do is sell private data to advertisers. For instance, if
you live in the US and drive a car, there's a good chance your data was sold by your state's DMV.)


Adtech industry is getting ever more creative. Evercookies are now considered ancient technology;
apparently even fingerprinting factory sensor calibration is old-school.


See also this, if you are wondering exactly what does the adtech industry do with all the data
it collects, how does it do it and why. Spoiler alert: all the data is being continuously
traded in order to cross-correlate it, ensuring no matter what steps you make to protect
your privacy, advertisers can recover the data they need. It also allows the advertisers
to scam each other on attribution, which isn't surprising if you consider that lying is literally
their job. Cancer cells don't play well with each other unless they have to.


I'm making this into a separate headline because this is some of the most sensitive
and damaging if abused information, which nonetheless is being abused.


Did you know that popular apps used by women to track their periods
spy on them and send the data off to advertisers, who then use it to target both app users and
their partners? This data is surprisingly valuable, at least for those with no dignity.


Mental health issues still have social stigma attached in the western world. For a person
seeking help in such a case, privacy is extremely important. Unfortunately, that privacy
is sometimes discarded in exchange for advertising revenue. A recent investigation into
popular mental health websites in France, Germany and the UK revealed that most of them
track visitors for advertising purposes, some even sharing mental health test answers
with third parties.


Slight annoyance in the EU (slightly bigger if you run a business), makes phones near-useless
for receiving calls in the US. Some of the calls are pure fraud, others - those made
by otherwise reputable companies - are just attempts at selling you something you don't
need for the price that usually isn't fair. If you ever had your parents or grandparents
spend a big chunk of their income or pension on some low-quality trinket, you know who to thank.


Here's a decent argument that advertising may ultimately kill phones as a service.


Mostly handled today through filters built into every mail service, but a pure example
of what happens when advertising is near-free. Similarly to robocalls, it severely diminished
the utility of e-mail as a service, driving people towards walled-in social networks, where
spam is easier to control (mostly through directing advertisers to different channels).


It's an off-line equivalent to spam, except you have to move them to the
garbage bin yourself - and a lot of people can't even be bothered to do that,
so they litter cities everywhere. It's a pure and unadulterated waste of
paper, paint and fuel, made in the hope that one in a thousand will convince
someone to maybe think about buying something.


SEO, AKA. gaming the search engines. Hugely popular. Often involves creating nonsense sites,
and spamming websites and web forums with comments. It pollutes search results for more
obscure queries, generally wasting people's time.


I used to run comments on this blog, and had my fair share of run-ins with SEO spammers.
I sometimes traced back the companies that were promoted in such way and contacted them with
requests to please stop spamming the Internet. It turned out that some of them didn't know
that the SEO agencies they hired engaged in comment spam (in one of those cases, upon me
contacting them the business apologized and immediately dropped their contact with their SEO agency;
I keep a post praising them up to this day.)


An open secret of news publishing - news is funded by ad views, and artificial outrage is extremely
effective at getting people to view pages filled with ads. It's also destructive to civilization.


Children usually don't have money, but they are easy to manipulate and do have the undivided attention of
their parents. A classical tactic is to drop a child-targeted ad in between episodes of a children's show,
and watch the money flow in. But that's old-school now. Nowadays, both TV and streaming services
are full of content that mix branding and entertainment, and unboxing videos are the new way
of working around the laws protecting children from advertising around the world. Ads don't stop there
either, they're in almost every popular mobile app for kids.


Also, the sophisticated adtech personalization algorithms, like always, screw things up.


This is why my kid isn't going to watch YouTube. If and when we decide to show her any children's show,
it'll be from a manually curated set of videos downloaded and streamed from a NAS. In my opinion,
it's irresponsible to expose children to modern advertising.


This is a pet peeve. As (of 2019) a fresh father, I've recently been exposed to a lot of advertising
for infant care products. I can survive free samples of gunk of dubious utility given to us at every
possible occasion. But when I received the ""child health book"" - an official medical document in which
health information is recorded over the years - I was floored when I noticed it had multiple full-page
ads in it. This is a document that is provided by publicly-funded hospitals. A document that
will likely outlive all the companies advertising in it. This is what the ad industry jumping the shark
looks like.


Almost everybody on the planet knows about Coca Cola and McDonald's. A good chunk of the population
has tasted both. So why do both companies still spend hundreds of millions to billions of dollars on
ads that they know aren't going to convince you to drop everything you do and buy their products?
Brand awareness. The goal here is to force an association between a product category and a brand,
so that when you are considering buying a product from that category, their brand will be the
one on your mind, and the one you feel safest buying.


Brand awareness competes for very limited real estate in your brain, so when you have
multiple brands competing, the end result is saturation bombing. That's why you can't walk
500 meters straight in a typical western city without seeing a Coca Cola logo somewhere.


Defined as ""tricks used in websites and apps that make you do things that you didn't mean to"". Here's a non-exhaustive list,
which unfortunately some morally bankrupt companies seem to use as a cookbook. It's an unfortunate feature
of a reality in which advertising has perverted the marketplace to the point it's very difficult to
compete by just offering a good product at a fair price.


The consequence of long-term exposure to dark patterns is that people develop immunity, which sometimes
claims benign or beneficial use cases as collateral damage. See for example this article about
redesign of UK's National Health Service website, where boxes containing important health-related
information were found to be ignored by users:


To our astonishment, a number of users said that they wouldnât read the
information in the boxes. They likened them to advertising on news sites and
overlooked them because of the ambiguity of the icon and the âREAD ME!!!â
look.


Measures to combat web spam (i.e. advertisers doing their daily job) also at times
conflict with accessibility, causing websites to be unusable for people utilizing screen readers.


There are three main reasons people install ad blockers. Dislike of ads, preventing privacy
incursions, and protecting your own computer from malware and unwanted software that eats
up its resources.


If you haven't read the excellent essay by Maciej Ceglowski, The Website Obesity Crisis, take a break
now and hop over. Maciej is a much better writer than me, and gives an excellent explanation of why
all the websites you visit load so slowly and eat so much of your mobile data allowance. Spoiler alert:
ads are a big part of the problem.


As for malware, the technical term is malvertising. Given how ad delivery works today - auctions
triggered by your browsing, determining what ad you'll be shown next, almost entirely outside
of control of the site that you're visiting, the old wisdom of ""don't visit porn sites or you'll get malware""
doesn't hold anymore. You can catch malware on almost any site that shows you ads now.


This includes things affectionately known as ""blog spam"" or ""content marketing"". Quite likely
the majority of articles regular people read on-line and share on social media. In its least
harmful form, it just wastes your time, providing you with very little actionable information
padded with some prose. I've seen first-hand how much work goes into making such material:
very little, mostly copy-pasting and rewording someone else's blog spam. The more dangerous incarnations
are purposeful misinformation. Bottom line, this content doesn't exist to help you - it exists
as a vector for delivering more advertising to you, either inline or through the site it's hosted on.


Though defined as advertising ""that matches the form and function of the platform upon which it appears"",
it's marketing code for ""disguising an ad as legitimate content"". While unmarked ads are technically illegal
in many places, ask yourself, how can you tell that the article you recently read mentioning a company
was honest, and not sponsored content? It ain't trivial.


AKA. people selling themselves out on the Internet. The whole idea is to subvert social proof by finding
people others can relate to and getting them to indirectly push products. Hugely popular on YouTube
and Instagram, and is again preying on people having trouble distinguishing fake from genuine.
At this level of sophistication, aren't we all such people, at some point? When you look at that
newest Facebook photo of a family member, are they really that bad at cleaning kitchen they
leave bags of expensive coffee out in the open, or are they a nanoinfluencer?


I can't stress enough how bad this is. In a world drowned in manipulative advertising, your circle
of friends and colleagues you know personally is your last source of trustworthy recommendations.
Sure, there were bad apples before - like people who join MLM cults - but they were obnoxious
enough to easily be spotted. But in general, you could trust the direct and indirect advice
of people in your social circle. ""Influencing"" is an ongoing attempt to poison that.


They pollute our landscape and distract drivers. To my surprise, the studies I've seen so far (1, 2)
conclude that billboards aren't usually a safety issue, even though they measurably capture
the attention of drivers. Still, I think everyone who like me regularly travels outside the city
can attest that the experience would be better without them.


Cambridge Analytica's attempt to use adtech infrastructure to subvert the US 2016 presidential elections
and the Brexit vote is a well-known story, but did you know that in the United States,
local police in multiple cities is now secretly working as advertising agencies for Amazon's home security IoT?


A marketer I know has a mantra, that successful sales are all about dissatisfaction - making
people aware just how their situation sucks, and then offering a way to relieve the pain.


The title of the following paper is enough to make a point on its own:
Advertising as a major source of human dissatisfaction: Cross-national evidence on one million Europeans.


(Fun fact: did you know that the grandson of the inventor of Public Relations and ""the first person to take Freud's
ideas to manipulate the masses"" is a co-founder of Netflix? Netflix and chill, alright.)


See also Cliff Ennico's talk on ""How To Sell Anything To Anybody"" (text summary). Note how
applying this, half of the time you'll be making people afraid for profit.


Have you noticed how many free services get significantly worse over time? Have you noticed
that just a couple of years ago, your Facebook and Instagram feeds contained almost exclusively
posts from your social network, whereas today they mostly show sponsored content and posts
from businesses?


Ad-driven business models win users over by offering a service for free, but in order to grow,
that service needs to continuously increase the amount of advertising and tracking it does.
Few of such services stay alive for long (usually thanks to the network effect), but all
of them prevent companies with more ethical and stable business models from entering the market by
sucking up all the available oxygen. You can't compete on price with free, doubly so in an era
where ad-driven businesses are what the investors prefer.


Marketing these days seems to have so good ROI that, given a fixed sum of money,
you're better off spending it on shouting louder than on actually improving the product.
This reduces research, development and production spending, which indirectly reduces the actual value provided
to all of us by the economy.


(h/t u/slippage for reminding me of that. I think everyone working in the software industry can relate.)


With all the cries that free content must be paid for somehow, you'd expect that you can avoid
""being the product"" if you pay the full price for a product or service. Nothing could be farther
from the truth. Movie theaters will still spam you with ads even though you paid for the ticket
and bought the popcorn. Newspapers will show you ads, whether or not you're a paying subscriber
(and they won't filter out native advertising content either). SaaS companies charge your credit
card with one hand, and sell your data with the other. Even your Office suite spies on you (at least
the web and mobile versions do), and gives your data to a predictive profiling marketing firm.


This is a cultural problem. We've become so accustomed to advertising that not having it shoved
in our face is a premium service that needs to be explicitly requested, and is rarely available.


(h/t Stavros for pointing this out to me. I'm so used to it that I haven't even thought of it.)


People tend to blame this on the European Union, but the truth is that under cookie laws,
sites are only required to show you a consent popup if they're using cookies for things
other than primary functionality of the site. If you're annoyed by them, be annoyed at the site,
as it only shows the warning because it tracks you.


To this day, I can't think of Carmen without immediately remembering a particular commercial
of a well-known brand of cleaning products. I saw that ad as a little kid, and it ruined
this opera for me forever. And I'm not the only one.


It's not just about old classics either. In another example of marketing people's complete lack of taste,
a song about the struggle of refugees displaced by war was gutted and turned into an ad for 2010 World Cup.


I remember reading about cases of scientific papers that were advertisements pretending to be
research work. I'll update this point when I find some actual examples.


Cancers ultimately damage critical functions of the body and lead to untimely death. Advertising,
similarly, poses a risk to our civilization through resource exhaustion, climate impact, and by eroding the
basic building block of societies - trust in one another, and trust in institutions we deal with.
What can be done about it?


I honestly have no good ideas. Advertising is so thoroughly embedded in our economies that trying
to ""just"" get rid of it would probably collapse our civilization (which is NOT a good thing; I'll
expand on this in the future). I feel this problem will need to be solved the hard way, piece by
piece, slowly reclaiming our institutions, our trust, our dignity.
Here's a non-exhaustive list of suggestions I'll be updating over time:


Obvious first step. Install uBlock Origin on all your browsers (on Android, switch to Firefox,
which supports extensions). Add Privacy Badger for good measure. Consider NoScript if you're
particularly annoyed by the website obesity crisis. If you have non-tech-savvy friends and family,
install uBlock Origin on their machines too - that'll let them extend the usable lifetime of their
computers by a couple of years.


AdNauseam is an interesting extension to consider too. It's based off uBlock Origin, except it
clicks on the ads in the background, in an attempt to make advertising more expensive and poison
the data they collect. Given the level of sophistication of fake click detection, it's unlikely to
make much difference, but ""every small step counts"", plus it also feels satisfying.


If you're willing to put up with some extra inconvenience on-line in order to both protect
yourself from advertisers and safeguard your privacy, consider using GNU IceCat as your main
browser. It's a Firefox variant with extra features aiming to defeat tracking and reduce
exposure to ethically questionable software.


GDPR is doing an excellent job destroying some of the most privacy-invasive practices of the
adtech industry. It offers a great opportunity for individual meaningful action. If you're
an European and see a site trying to abuse you in a way that's illegal, file a complaint.
If you're not an EU citizen, lobby your government to enact similar legislation. The movements
around this are gaining steam worldwide.


Some people point out that Google benefited the most from GDPR, and more legislation like it would
only make life even more difficult for innovative adtech upstarts, benefiting the large incumbents
instead. But this might actually be a good thing - we don't need more innovation in that market,
we need that market to wither and die. It's also easier for regulators to keep few larger companies
in line than it is to deal with a convoluted network of fly-by-night adtech startups.


(See also an argument by Richard Stallman that GDPR and similar legislation aren't nearly enough,
and one should aim to prevent data collection from happening in the first place. This is related
to the concept of Datensparsamkeit, or ""data frugality"".)


GDPR is primarily about control over data, not about advertising. But it's also important to push
for legislation targeting advertisers directly. SÃ£o Paulo is among many cities that have managed
to ban outdoor advertising, demonstrating it's both possible and worthwhile.


Businesses are made of people, and people have ethics. If you're running one, consider the way you advertise.
Are you aiming at making mutually beneficial transactions, or are you just trying to milk
you users out of their hard-earned cash? Not all advertising is inherently harmful to individuals
or society. Choose the ethical option. It may cost your company some lost profits, but then again,
you may gain loyal customers who'll want to reward a honest business.


Also known as ""voting with your wallet"". Out of set of options, pick the more honest one.
If you have a moment, tell the others why you didn't choose them.


Once again, businesses are made of people. Out of those that engage in abusive or harmful marketing,
not all have ill intent. These days, ""dark patterns"" are essentially forced upon
companies by competitive markets, and it's hard to resist. But maybe, just maybe, enough complaints
from real would-be customers will cause some of them to change their ways.


This applies to technologists out here - we're in a privileged position, where it's much easier
for us to be picky about the jobs we do than for most other people. Many of us already make
principled stances like refusing to work on defense projects; why not also avoid helping the
industry that harms people during peace time much more than defense companies?


There's light at the end of this tunnel (and it's not the incoming train).
A recent article by the EFF reminds us of pop-up ads which, once the menace of the Internet, have
all but disappeared. The advertising industry is laser-focused on methods that manipulate people best.
If a technique stops working, e.g. because of legal, social or technical interference, it's
immediately abandoned. This means that advertising can be fought off piece by piece. It's hard,
but possible.


All of the suggestions above scale with the number of people who follow them. The more of us
rise against advertising, the stronger the market, social and political signals become.
So, if you see what I see, if you feel as I feel, and if you would seek as I seek, then I ask you
to spread the message. Speak up about the cancerous nature of advertising, and how better off we all
would be if that disease was cured.


Thanks to Stavros Korokithakis and Michael McCune for reviewing drafts of this post and providing helpful suggestions.

Asian equities were mixed but mostly higher overnight as Hong Kong and Mainland China outperformed and Indonesia and the Philippines underperformed.
DeepSeek announced that it would be restricting access to its servers due to capacity constraints. This is interesting as, while its model was efficient and relatively cheap to develop, ever-increasing demand for querying it still demands a great deal of server space. This led cloud computing and data infrastructure names to continue their rise. Tuya, in particular, gained +43% after advertising to developers that they can access DeepSeek’s models through their system.
The electric vehicle ecosystem also performed well overnight, especially Geely, up +8%, and Li Auto, up +8%. The gains were seemingly driven by enthusiasm over potential technological advances in China’s vehicle industry using AI. However, semiconductor names were mostly lower.
Tencent was the most heavily traded stock in Hong Kong by value, gaining +1.86%, followed by smartphone maker Xiaomi, which gained +4.96%. These names helped lead the technology surge this week higher, finishing strong overnight.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent gave an interview to Bloomberg News on Thursday. He said that he was not sure of the long-term inflationary impact of tariffs. He said that the effect would be offset by other policies, such as deregulation. He also cited China’s excess capacity as a reason for the lack of inflationary pressure stemming from tariffs. Our thesis continues to be that tariffs are an opening salvo in a trade negotiation. The first call did with Xi apparently did not accomplish this, though. As the most complex and important trade relationship the U.S. has, getting China trade right will take some time.
All sectors were higher in Mainland China’s markets.
The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes both closed higher by +1.16% and +1.80%, respectively, overnight on volume that increased +38% from yesterday. Mainland investors bought a net $136 million worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs overnight via Southbound Stock Connect. The top-performing sectors were Information Technology, which gained +4.54%, Real Estate, which gained +2.00%, and Consumer Discretionary, which gained +1.81%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Energy, which fell -1.10%, Health Care, which fell -0.42%, and Utilities, which fell -0.21%.
Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board all closed higher by +1.01%, +1.61%, and +0.75%, respectively. The top-performing sectors were Consumer Discretionary, which gained +2.74%, Real Estate, which gained +2.25%, and Information Technology, which gained +1.96%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Utilities, which gained +0.03%, Financials, which gained +0.66%, and Energy, which gained +0.72%. Exchange rates and yields were mostly flat overnight.

42,2025-02-10,The Dow Jones and S&P 500 climbed on the stock market today. Monday.com stock popped after earnings while steel stocks rose.

Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ: AFRM), a financial technology company that offers services, such as buy now, pay later, and point-of-sale payment solutions, surpassed market expectations in its second quarter of fiscal 2025 (fiscal ends in June), reporting revenue of $866 million and earnings of $0.23 per share. These results significantly outperformed the street forecasts, which had projected revenue of $807 million and a loss of $0.15 per share. Following the solid Q2 beat and a guidance that met expectations, the company’s stock trended upward, surging 22% on February 7. Separately, BMY stock didn’t share the same fate as AFRM despite an earnings beat. Check out – Should You Pick Bristol Myers Squibb Stock At $57?
AFRM stock, with 53% returns since the beginning of 2024, has outperformed the S&P 500 index, up 26%. A rise in gross merchandise volume for Affirm has driven its stock price growth lately. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.
Affirm Holdings’ revenue of $866 million in Q2 reflected a solid 47% y-o-y growth, driven by strong growth across business verticals. Affirm saw a 138% y-o-y growth in gain on sale of loans, a 33% jump in network revenue, a 42% surge in interest income, and a 28% rise in servicing income. Affirm’s key operating metrics – GMV – grew 35% y-o-y to $10.1 billion. This financial performance points toward improving monetization for the company. Furthermore, it also saw a 19% rise in active consumers to 21 million, and a 22% rise in the number of transactions per active user.
Affirm reported a profit of $0.23 per share in Q2, compared to a loss per share of $0.54 in the prior-year quarter. Looking forward, it expects its Q3 revenues to be around $770 million, at the mid-point of the provided range. This aligns with the consensus estimates.
Turning to AFRM stock, it has experienced a significant upward move recently. However, this has been accompanied by considerable volatility. The changes in AFRM stock over the last few years have been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500.
In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and ongoing trade wars, could AFRM face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see higher levels? At its current levels of $75, AFRM stock is trading at 8.5x trailing revenues, marginally below the 8.6x average P/S ratio over the last two years. Based on Affirm’s recent strong performance, we believe an upward revision to its historical valuation multiple is warranted. Applying a P/S ratio of 9.5x, which represents a 10% premium to its historical average, suggests a price target of $84 – implying 12% potential upside from current levels. Separately, after a weak outlook, see What’s Next For FMC Stock?
While AFRM stock looks like it has some room for growth, it is helpful to see how Affirm Holdings’ Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

Tribeca Park Cafe would very much like customers to know that the higher prices are not its fault.

        ""Due to high increase in egg, dairy products, and coffee prices, unfortunately, we have been forced to accommodate those high costs,"" a sign taped to the glass around its deli counter reads.
    

        To emphasize, or perhaps provide evidence for, the claim, the Manhattan deli's management has taken it upon itself to print out recent news stories about high egg prices. I know about this because one of those news stories is my own, headlined ""Eggs may be expensive forever."" In addition to two other articles, from CNN and The New York Times, Tribeca Park also has one last message for customers: ""We remain committed to providing high-quality products and appreciate your understanding during this time.""
    

        It's an understandable explanation. Egg prices have exploded lately, due in large part to the bird flu, which has resulted in the loss of tens of millions of egg-laying chickens in recent months. (Once one chicken on a farm tests positive for avian influenza, all the other chickens at that location have to be culled, as in, killed.) The average nationwide cost of a dozen Grade A large eggs hit $4.15 in December, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, up from $2.51 a year ago. The average wholesale price of Midwest large eggs is $7.93 a dozen, up from $3.33 this time last year, the global commodities tracker Expana found.
    

        High egg prices are surely cutting into the margins of some businesses, especially smaller operations such as Tribeca Park Cafe, which has an egg-heavy product offering. But given all the price increases in the past five or so years — and the evidence that big companies were able to add extra price increases just because they could — it's hard not to wonder whether all the news about egg prices gives some businesses a little extra leeway in what they charge. People have seen the headlines about egg prices, they've noticed what's going on in the grocery store aisle, and the instability of the postpandemic economy gives businesses more room to push costs onto customers.
    

        The result: an opportunity for some eggs-cuse-flation.
    

        The egg-pocalypse has officially hit the zeitgeist: Grocery stores across the country are experiencing egg shortages and limiting how many cartons of eggs customers can buy. Google searches about egg prices have soared. Earlier this month, 100,000 eggs were stolen from an egg farmer in Pennsylvania. Egg-related conspiracy theories have been hatched, including that drones have something to do with the bird flu's spread.
    

        ""It's crazy,"" said Brian Moscogiuri, a global trade strategist at Eggs Unlimited, a California-based egg supplier, joking that the egg-mania had made him famous. The day we spoke, he'd been talking to reporters about the Pennsylvania egg heist and whether it would influence egg prices. ""I'm like, 'What do you mean some eggs were stolen?' It's the same if TVs get stolen: Does it affect the supply of TVs?"" he said.
    

        No, $40,000 in missing eggs is not an excuse for your grocery store or bodega to raise prices. But the constraints on just how many eggs farmers can harvest are legitimately squeezing businesses.
    

        We're in year three of this most recent bird flu outbreak, and there's no clear end in sight. Egg prices have bounced up and down during that time, and lately, they've been on the upswing. Some businesses have managed to somewhat shield customers from fluctuations. Raising prices can be an ordeal, and many grocery stores use eggs as a ""loss leader,"" something they sell at a low cost to get people in the door.
    

        ""The food service industry typically reacts more slowly to fluctuations in wholesale pricing because adjusting menu prices is a complex process,"" Karyn Rispoli, a managing editor for eggs in the Americas at Expana, said. ""Restaurants have likely tried to absorb these rising costs for as long as possible, but after nine consecutive weeks of sustained increases, it's reached a point where they can no longer do so without impacting their bottom line.""
    

        Last week, Waffle House announced it would be adding a $0.50 surcharge to each egg that customers order amid an ""unprecedented rise in egg prices."" Blake's Lotaburger, a fast-food chain based in New Mexico, is adding a $1 surcharge to its items that include eggs. Online, there's anecdotal chatter about egg surcharges at brunch and extra-$0.50 egg sandwiches. A coworker recently noticed the local farm-fresh eggs at a store near her went up from $5 to $6 a dozen, even though the farm is, presumably, operating the same way as it was before.
    

        Rob Perez, a co-owner of DV8 Kitchen in Lexington, Kentucky, started adding a $0.25 surcharge per egg to dishes in January, and in February, he upped the charge to $0.50. His two locations go through nearly 5,000 eggs a week, and wholesale price increases have become impossible to swallow. ""The prices don't go from high to low. They inch down, and they fly up,"" he said. Thus far, customers have been understanding, though he recently realized his staff hadn't been consistently ringing up the surcharge on orders. He thinks it's partly accidental, partly intentional. ""You never want to tell anybody, especially if you're going to get a tip,"" he said.
    

        Like most of the operators implementing a surcharge, Perez said it would go away once prices came back down. In the meantime, he thinks the news coverage around eggs is probably helping his case. ""Waffle House is going to provide all the education that people need,"" he said.
    

        There is, of course, one big reason that many restaurants and grocery stores can get away with these price hikes: People are still willing to buy the eggs.
    

        Alex Jacquez, the chief of policy and advocacy at the Groundwork Collective, a progressive think tank, and a former economic advisor in the Biden administration, said that while he was at the White House, they found retailers generally tried to keep eggs cheap as long as possible, given their consumer salience. But many retailers are reaching their limit.
    

        ""It really seems like the dam has broken. Inflation has persisted,"" he said. ""Consumers have said that they're willing to continue to buy eggs, no matter what price.""
    

        Because eggs are a product people buy often, people generally know their price, but what counts as ""acceptable"" has been shifting. While $8 for a dozen eggs might have seemed outlandish in 2019, for today's consumers, it's par for the course. Even if people aren't thrilled about shelling out that much money, they're accustomed to some level of sticker shock. And since there's also so much variation in pricing — by store, geography, and egg type — retailers may be able to confuse people on the exact degree of the increase.
    

        Jada Thompson, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas, said that it's hard to tell which stores are selling at a discount and which stores are charging the actual price. It's also hard to decipher who's leading on hikes and who's following. ""Bob's selling them for $4, and Fred's selling them for $5. Is Fred taking the price up, or was Bob taking a loss?""
    

        Every operation along the supply chain is trying to mitigate its own volatility risks, which could lead to some extra padding.
    

        Firms have taken advantage of moments of uncertainty and chaos in the recent past — namely, when inflation took off amid the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war — to add a little extra margin to their bottom line. Research by the University of Massachusetts Amherst economist Isabella Weber and others found that companies were able to raise prices beyond what was justified by actual price increases to boost their profits, a phenomenon some have called excuse-flation. The media narrative played into expectations and price setting, too. If customers have heard on the news that businesses are scrambling, they may see the sudden jump in their grocery bills as the result of legitimate issues, rather than profiteering.
    

        ""Consumers are primed to believe that things are crazy right now with prices, and they could go up, and they could go down. And they might not be as sensitive to it as they would be in a persistently low-inflation environment, giving companies the perfect opportunity to raise their prices,"" Jacquez said.
    

        For companies, the chaos, in theory, provides a bit of cover to add to their coffers. Why add an extra $1 just to cover the increased cost of goods when customers are willing to stomach a $2 increase, giving you an extra $1 of pure profit? It looks good to investors, and with everything going on, are consumers really going to notice?
    

        ""Large businesses had a number of excuses to raise prices, and consumers just didn't seem to want to or care to push back,"" Samuel Rines, a macroeconomic strategist at WisdomTree, said. ""So all of a sudden, companies that weren't supposed to have much pricing power suddenly found themselves with a tremendous amount.""
    

        Some of this is a story of market concentration — if you're Pepsi or Coca-Cola, you can increase your prices and assume your main competitor is probably going along with you. Even in more competitive markets, if everyone thinks the other guy is going to charge more, they will, too. In eggs, specifically, there has been some suggestion that market concentration is responsible for price increases — namely, that Cal-Maine Foods, which controls about one-fifth of the egg market, is to blame. The egg producer has benefited from soaring egg prices in the past, though economists say it's not clear Big Egg is really to blame here.
    

        ""I won't name names, but there were companies who were putting up really high profits, and everybody's like, 'Why are you putting up profits while everybody else is tanking?'"" Thompson said. ""It was only because they had eggs during a shortage, and so their farms were benefiting from higher prices.""
    

        Most of the businesses adding surcharges for eggs say that this will all be temporary — once wholesale prices come back down, they'll go ahead and pass that along to customers. But those surcharges may prove sticky.
    

        ""We saw a bunch of supply-chain-related surcharges coming out of the pandemic that stuck around for a while,"" Neale Mahoney, a Stanford University economist, said.
    

        Mahoney, who served on the National Economic Council under then-President Joe Biden and, among more pressing items, was tasked with looking into the egg market, said that the increase in wholesale egg prices had created a ""permission structure"" for firms to raise their prices. And as prices increase, every link along the supply chain sees a chance to up its fee.
    

        Beyond surcharges and price increases, businesses may find other ways to fudge the lines on eggs. Henry Kim, the cofounder and CEO of Swiftly, a retail-technology platform, has pitched that grocers could move eggs in their stores to the meat department because when positioned next to beef or chicken, they'd look cheap. (This could also solve some of the demand problem because if eggs aren't in the dairy department, consumers won't be able to find them as easily.)
    

        Not to be mean to eggs, but they are not really The Most Important Thing Happening in the Economy, despite all the attention they're getting. They are, however, a signal that businesses might take advantage of broader economic turmoil to pass on other price hikes. Consider the example of tariffs, which President Donald Trump has threatened and removed and delayed to the point that it's impossible for even the closest observers to keep track. If the grocery store adds a little extra to the avocado price tag, or that new car seems a few thousand dollars more expensive than it should have been, are consumers going to dig in and decipher the extent to which tariffs are to blame versus opportunism on the part of the grocery store or dealer? Think of all the surcharges and price hikes in recent years that have been vaguely blamed on ""supply chain problems"" without much further explanation. The tariff chaos could generate an ""upward impulse on prices,"" Mahoney said.
    

        Eggs, in short, might be the canary in the coal mine for what's to come in terms of a new round of excuse-flation. I should probably make an egg pun here, but I am out of them.
    

        There is no denying that we are in an unprecedented moment for America's eggs. This bird flu outbreak is scary. The egg industry is hurting. Restaurants, grocery stores, and other businesses that depend on eggs are reaching a breaking point.
    

        Perez, from DV8 Kitchen, at one point pondered whether it might just be easier for everyone to take a vacation than to keep seeing his margins squeezed with all his egg-heavy items. He's open only for breakfast and lunch, and he doesn't serve liquor, which is often a moneymaker in the food service industry. Beyond the egg surcharge, he's trying to get some customers to try a different dish.
    

        ""We're trying to figure out how to switch people from egg dishes to other dishes to make them more special and get them to think, 'Hey, I want to go and have a ham and apple butter on a Southern biscuit instead of that egg sandwich,'"" he said.
    

        For now, consumers should be prepared to see their egg prices go up — in the grocery aisle, at the deli, at brunch. And given all the chatter about it, people probably won't be surprised, either. Call it the Waffle House effect.

46,2025-02-10,"In the coming years, AI systems will have a major impact on the ways people work. For that reason, we're launching the Anthropic Economic Index, an initiative aimed at understanding AI's effects on labor markets and the economy over time.
The Index’s initial report provides first-of-its-kind data and analysis based on millions of anonymized conversations on Claude.ai, revealing the clearest picture yet of how AI is being incorporated into real-world tasks across the modern economy.
We're also open sourcing the dataset used for this analysis, so researchers can build on and extend our findings. Developing policy responses to address the coming transformation in the labor market and its effects on employment and productivity will take a range of perspectives. To that end, we are also inviting economists, policy experts, and other researchers to provide input on the Index.
The main findings from the Economic Index’s first paper are:
See below for further details on our initial findings.
Our new paper builds on a long line of research on the labor market impact of technologies, from the Spinning Jenny of the Industrial Revolution to the car-manufacturing robots of the present day. We focus on the ongoing impact of AI. We don’t survey people on their AI use, or attempt to forecast the future; instead, we have direct data on how AI is actually being used.
Our research began with an important insight from the economics literature: sometimes it makes sense to focus on occupational tasks rather than occupations themselves. Jobs often share certain tasks and skills in common: for example, visual pattern recognition is a task performed by designers, photographers, security screeners, and radiologists.
Certain tasks lend themselves better to being automated or augmented by a new technology than others. We’d therefore expect AI to be adopted selectively for different tasks across different occupations, and that analyzing tasks—in addition to jobs as a whole—would give us a fuller picture of how AI is being integrated into the economy.
This research was made possible by Clio, a system that allows us to analyze conversations with Claude while preserving user privacy1. We used Clio on a dataset of approximately one million conversations with Claude (specifically, Free and Pro conversations on Claude.ai), and used it to organize the conversations by occupational task.
We chose tasks according to the classification made by the U.S. Department of Labor, which maintains a database of around 20,000 specific work-related tasks called the Occupational Information Network, or O*NET. Clio matched each conversation with the O*NET task that best represented the role of the AI in the conversation (the process is summarized in the figure below). We then followed the O*NET scheme for grouping the tasks into the occupations they best represented, and the occupations into a small set of overall categories: education and library, business and financial, and so on.
Uses of AI by job type. The tasks and occupations with by far the largest adoption of AI in our dataset were those in the “computer and mathematical” category, which in large part covers software engineering roles. 37.2% of queries sent to Claude were in this category, covering tasks like software modification, code debugging, and network troubleshooting.
The second largest category was “arts, design, sports, entertainment, and media” (10.3% of queries), which mainly reflected people using Claude for various kinds of writing and editing. Unsurprisingly, occupations involving a high degree of physical labor, such as those in the “farming, fishing, and forestry” category (0.1% of queries), were least represented.
We also compared the rates in our data to the rates at which each occupation appeared in the labor market in general. The comparisons are shown in the figure below.
Depth of AI use within occupations. Our analysis found that very few occupations see AI use across most of their associated tasks: only approximately 4% of jobs used AI for at least 75% of tasks. However, more moderate use of AI is much more widespread: roughly 36% of jobs had some use of AI for at least 25% of their tasks.
As we predicted, there wasn’t evidence in this dataset of jobs being entirely automated: instead, AI was diffused across the many tasks in the economy, having stronger impacts for some groups of tasks than others.
AI use and salary. The O*NET database provides the median U.S. salary for each of the occupations listed. We added this information to our analysis, allowing us to compare professions’ median salaries and the level of AI use in their corresponding tasks.
Interestingly, both low-paying and very-high-paying jobs had very low rates of AI use (these were generally jobs involving a large degree of manual dexterity, such as shampooers and obstetricians). It was specific occupations in the mid-to-high median salary ranges, like computer programmers and copywriters, who were—in our data—among the heaviest users of AI.
Automation versus augmentation. We also looked in more detail at how the tasks were being performed—specifically, at which tasks involved “automation” (where AI directly performs tasks such as formatting a document) versus “augmentation” (where AI collaborates with a user to perform a task).
Overall, we saw a slight lean towards augmentation, with 57% of tasks being augmented and 43% of tasks being automated. That is, in just over half of cases, AI was not being used to replace people doing tasks, but instead worked with them, engaging in tasks like validation (e.g., double-checking the user’s work), learning (e.g., helping the user acquire new knowledge and skills), and task iteration (e.g., helping the user brainstorm or otherwise doing repeated, generative tasks).
Our study provides a unique glimpse into how AI is changing the labor market. But as with all studies it has important limitations. Some of these include:
AI use is rapidly expanding, and models are becoming ever-more capable. The labor-market picture may look quite different within a relatively short time. For that reason, we’ll repeat many of the analyses above over time to help track the societal and economic changes that are likely to occur. We’ll regularly release the results and the associated datasets as part of the Anthropic Economic Index.
These kinds of longitudinal analyses can give us new insights into AI and the job market. For example, we’ll be able to monitor changes in the depth of AI use within occupations. If it remains the case that AI is used only for certain tasks, and only a few jobs use AI for the vast majority of their tasks, the future might be one where most current jobs evolve rather than disappear. We can also monitor the ratio of automation to augmentation, providing signals of areas where automation is becoming more prevalent.
Our research gives data on how AI is being used, but it doesn’t provide policy prescriptions. Answers to questions about how to prepare for AI’s impact on the labor market can’t come directly from research in isolation; instead, they’ll come from a combination of evidence, values, and experience from broad perspectives. We look forward to using our new methodology to shed more light on these issues.
Read the full paper for more details of our analyses and results.
The most important contribution of this paper, and of the Anthropic Economic Index, is its new methodology providing detailed data on the impacts of AI. We’re immediately openly sharing the dataset we used for the above analyses, and we plan to share further such datasets as they become available in the future.
The full dataset can be downloaded here.

By Timothy Aeppel
(Reuters) - Stephen Bullock’s phone rang early Monday morning last week at his small factory in North Carolina with an urgent message from his distributor up in Toronto who was rattled by what looked like an unfolding U.S.-Canada trade war.
Two of the machines Bullock’s company produces - bulky contraptions used to lay concrete curbs, highway barriers, and sidewalks - were due to be shipped to Canada in a few weeks. Was there any way to get the 25,000-pound machines on trucks, like, today?
""They said get them here as quick as you can,"" said Bullock, President of Power Curbers, who scrambled to pull two finished machines destined for other buyers the next day.
By then, the panic over potential tit-for-tat tariffs between the two neighbors had subsided - though the trucks carrying the $350,000 machines still rolled the 700-plus miles north.
Not even 48 hours after President Donald Trump announced 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada to take effect on Tuesday, the second-term president put the levies on Canada on hold, hours after unveiling a similar reprieve for Mexico. Canada had vowed to retaliate with its own levies on an array of U.S. goods, including orange juice and trucks. Bullock and his sales team worried his machines would get caught up in the cross-border spat.
That kind of factory floor turmoil illustrates how tariffs can swiftly ricochet through economies, in unpredictable and often costly ways.
Canada is the single-largest U.S. export destination among countries, with roughly $350 billion of American goods sent there last year, roughly 17% of total goods exports of just under $2.1 trillion. Exports to our two bordering neighbors totals $683.4 billion, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Trump, on the campaign trail and in his first weeks in office, has extolled tariffs as a tool to boost domestic producers and fill the U.S. Treasury.
And to be sure, some manufacturers love them. Leon Topalian, CEO of top U.S. steelmaker Nucor praised Trump's tariff plans in a brief statement released by the company last weekend. New tariffs would have boosted steel prices, at least temporarily.
But many other business leaders and groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers, said tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada - parts of a close-knit North American supply chain - would hurt many domestic producers. Even companies that sell mostly ""Made in the USA"" goods often rely on Canadian and Mexican suppliers for parts or produce some finished goods there themselves that they sell back in the U.S.
'DEAL WITH IT'
One big risk is retaliation. When the U.S. slaps tariffs on imported goods, the targeted countries usually hit back with their own fees.
President Trump acknowledged last Sunday that his tariffs may cause ""short-term"" pain for Americans as global markets reflected concerns they could slow growth and fuel inflation. Economists warn a new surge in prices could slow the Federal Reserve’s moves to cut interest rates.
Kip Eideberg, senior vice president of government relations at the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, noted that 30% of all the equipment made in the U.S. - everything from tractors to bulldozers - is exported. Canada is their largest market.
""Equipment manufacturers across the board, across product segments, are moving equipment up to Canada in anticipation of these tariffs being levied,"" he said, referring to both U.S. tariffs and expected retaliation. The levies could come back into play in a month if a longer-term deal or another reprieve is not reached.
Eideberg said that while there's heavy focus on the auto industry, it's not unusual for parts or materials in his industry to move across a North American border five times as it goes through the production process.
Some domestic producers are resigned to rolling with the volatility of tariff threats, even when they know they may be hit. Speaking to investors in late January, Caterpillar CEO Jim Umpleby said: ""We’ve been around a hundred years, and we’ve seen many different administrations with different attitudes on these issues (tariffs) - and we’ll deal with it.""
Jochen Zeitz, CEO of Harley Davidson, struck a similar tone in an investor call last week, noting their manufacturing is concentrated in the U.S. and even their sourcing of parts is ""U.S. centric."" Even so, motorcycles were on the list of products Canada planned to hit with retaliatory tariffs.
CLOUDING THE OUTLOOK
Some companies that stand to benefit from tariffs say they’re seeing gains even before the new taxes are implemented, as customers increasingly look for ways to minimize their exposure. For instance, Kaysun, a small maker of high-tech plastic parts used in medical, industrial, automotive, and consumer products in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, has seen more interest from prospects looking to buy American.
Ben Harrison, the company’s CEO, said he got a visit from a company two weeks ago that currently has parts made in Mexico and Asia. ""They’re looking to start bringing in products from those countries because of higher costs,"" he said.
Tariffs did go up this week by 10% on U.S. imports from China, which hasn't yet forged an agreement to postpone the taxes.
Back at Power Curbers, CEO Bullock said he’s continuing to plan for tariffs on more countries and regions, including the European Union, another big market for his machines. The company, which employs about 125 workers, exports to over 100 countries. Canada is its largest foreign market.
He would like to rush more goods north now, he said, but his assembly line is constrained by the availability of parts and the need for additional workers. To get more goods to Canada, he said, he’ll need to juggle production schedules to see if he can postpone shipments to some domestic buyers to free up supply.
Until recently, this was shaping up to be a good year. Bullock had projected business would grow about 10% in 2025 and had planned to expand production in April by hiring an additional half dozen workers.
Tariffs have cast a shadow on that. ""We can’t make that kind of long-term decision,"" he said, ""until we see how this all plays out.""

FMC stock (NYSE: FMC), an agricultural science company focused on products to improve crop yield and quality, has seen a large 37% fall in a week, amid a bleak outlook for 2025. It delivered mixed fourth-quarter results, with earnings surpassing but revenue falling short of analyst expectations. The company posted sales of $1.22 billion, below the projected $1.34 billion, as lower pricing and unfavorable foreign exchange rates impacted revenue. However, adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.79, beating the consensus forecast of $1.60. While FMC’s outlook was dim, so was that for BMY stock. Should You Pick Bristol Myers Squibb Stock At $57?
Now, FMC stock is down 43% since the beginning of 2024, underperforming the broader S&P500 index, up 26%. Although much of this decline came last week, the inventory de-stocking issue has weighed on the company’s performance lately. If you are looking for an upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.
FMC’s revenue of $1.22 billion in Q4 was up 7% y-o-y, and up 12% on an organic basis. It saw a 15% jump in volumes, driven by an increased demand in North America, while its overall pricing remained soft. Looking at segments, North America was up 23%, Latin America down 10%, Asia up 10%, EMEA up 18%, and the Plant Health sales were up 33%.
FMC saw its adjusted EBITDA margin expand by 550 bps to 27.7% in Q4, compared to 22.2% in the prior-year quarter. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in earnings of $1.79 per share, up 67% y-o-y. Looking forward, FMC expects its 2025 sales to be $4.25 billion and adjusted earnings of $3.48 per share, at the mid-points of the provided range. This is much lower than the consensus estimates of $4.40 billion and $4.36, respectively.
A large gap in outlook didn’t sit well with the investors and the stock dropped over 30% after the results announcement. The volatility in FMC stock is not something new. Even if we look at a slightly longer time frame, the changes in FMC stock over the recent years have been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500.
In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is much less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and ongoing trade wars, could FMC face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2023, and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a recovery? After its recent fall, FMC stock does appear attractive from a valuation perspective. At its current levels of $35, it’s trading at just 1.0x trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of 2.2x over the last five years. While the company’s dim 2025 outlook warrants a lower valuation multiple, we believe the current price-to-sales ratio has fallen excessively below its historical average. In our view, the current stock pullback presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors seeking robust future returns. Separately, up on a good quarter, see Buy, Sell, Or Hold PINS Stock At $40?

52,2025-02-10,"It’s been amazing to see the rise of “youngtimers” in the car market, cult classics from the 1980s and ’90s that are seeing huge surges in popularity both on social media and at high-end car shows and auctions. At the upcoming Amelia Island Concours next month, Gooding & Company is auctioning off a host of youngtimers, including what might be the finest Ruf Yellowbird in existence. But my two favorites from the sale are a pair of seemingly unassuming late-’80s Mercedes-Benz E-Classes that, upon closer inspection, are actually monstrous six-liter AMG Hammers — and both have super-rare manual transmissions. If you’ve got about $4 million burning a hole in your pocket, I can’t think of a better way to spend it.
Yes, I said $4 million. Gooding estimates the 1988 300E 6.0 sedan will go for $1,250,000-$1,750,000, while the even rarer 1989 300CE 6.0 coupe will sell for $1,500,000-$2,000,000. Is that pretty nuts? Yes and no. These things used to trade hands in the very low six-figure range, especially for the lowlier 5.6-liter Hammers, but in recent years they’ve jumped up closer to the million-dollar mark. A 1991 300CE 6.0 coupe sold for $885,000 at Amelia Island two years ago, for instance. It’s the manual transmissions and overall provenances and conditions of these two Hammers that have pushed their prices into the stratosphere.
Italian industrialist Raul Gardini commissioned AMG to build the pair of cars with a bespoke five-speed Getrag manual. They are the only two 6.0-liter cars known to feature a manual transmission from the factory, as every other Hammer came from the factory with a four-speed automatic, though some have been converted after the fact through the aftermarket. “Standard” Hammers with the 5.6-liter engine were a $17,000 upgrade over a normal 300E when new, but going for the bored-out 6.0-liter would cost you an additional 40 grand, and you’d need another 14 grand to get the full suspension package and then shell out $18,000 to have the car actually built.
The Blue Black Metallic 300E sedan left the Mercedes factory on October 6, 1986 and was shipped directly to AMG’s headquarters in Affalterbach, where it started to go under the knife. In addition to shoving in the 6.0-liter M117 V8, which put out 370 horsepower and allowed for a top speed of over 190 mph, AMG’s Hammer transformation included a new exhaust, a long-range fuel tank, monoblock wheels, lowered suspension, a body kit, special wood trim, a new steering wheel and Recaro seats covered in Buffalo brown leather.
Gardini took delivery of the sedan in April 1988, but the manual wasn’t put in until 1989. Following Gardini’s suicide in 1993 after he was involved in a political corruption scandal, the Hammer was sold to “infamous” Italian car collector Luigi Compiano, who “registered the Hammer in the name of his Padova-based private security company – a business that went bankrupt in 2013 after he had siphoned corporate funds to amass a personal collection of 450 cars, 80 boats, and thousands of motorcycles.” After Compiano’s collection was seized by the Italian government, his cars were put up for auction in 2016, where the Hammer sedan was then acquired by an American collector who had the car recommissioned by Europa Imports in Winnetka, Illinois and had the engine rebuilt by Blue Ridge MB of Lilburn, Georgia. As it sits, the Hammer sedan has around 34,800 miles on it.
The Anthracite Grey Metallic 300CE coupe doesn’t have quite as interesting of a history, but it’s definitely the cooler car. It left the Mercedes factory in January 1988, also being immediately sent to AMG where it got the extremely awesome widebody kit, three-piece wheels, and all the other Hammer accoutrements before being delivered to Gardini in August 1989. Like the sedan, it was sent back to AMG in 1989 to receive the manual transmission, and it actually didn’t get the 6.0-liter engine put in until October 1992.
After Gardini’s death the coupe was purchased by a Faenza-based Mercedes dealer who quickly sold it to an organization that racing in Italy’s Formula 3 championship. The car was later owned by Elene Faroni 1994 to 2014, after which it was acquired by a German collector and then its current owner, an American collector. Gooding says the Hammer coupe has undergone a concours-level detailing process and has just under 37,000 miles on the odometer.
Both of these Hammers have been “inspected, physically verified and researched” by the AMG Classic team and brand specialists MKB Manufaktur, and both come with certificates confirming all of the build details and part numbers. Each car also has its original owner’s manuals, brochures, first aid kits and other corresponding documents.
For fans of pre-merger AMGs, it’s hard to think of a more desirable pair of vehicles. Gooding is offering the two cars as separate lots, but I kinda hope they’re bought by the same person — these Hammers deserve to be reunited in the same garage once again. The two-day Amelia Island auction kicks off on Thursday, March 6, ending the following day on Friday, March 7."

The Magnificent Seven has turned into the Stupendous One as AI spending fears weigh on sentiment.
The usually reliably hot Magnificent Seven trade of Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) has underwhelmed more than one month into 2025. Only one of the big-cap tech components — Meta — has notched double-digit gains out of the box.
In fact, shares of Meta have risen for 15 straight sessions through Monday — bringing its year-to-date advance to a stellar (or stupendous...) 20%.
Amazon is the only other Mag Seven component to be up on the year to the tune of 5.9%, slightly ahead of the 3.4% increase for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Alphabet, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla are all down year to date, with an average drop of 3% based on Yahoo Finance's calculations.
Tesla is the worst performer on the year, down 6% as it has been hit with less-than-inspiring sales news from across the world. Tariff concerns have also weighed on the stock, similar to other auto plays like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F).
Digging deeper, six out of seven Mag Seven members have reported fourth quarter earnings so far: All but Meta are down since their reports. Alphabet is down the most at 10.4%, as the Street reacted very negatively to its initial 2025 outlook.
""Price reactions suggest growing concerns around monetization vs. capex for hyperscalers,"" said BofA strategist Savita Subramanian in a client note on Monday.
To Subramanian's point, the capital expenditure numbers being tossed for 2025 by Big Tech to build out AI infrastructure have been eye-popping — and have caught investors off guard. Collectively, they have the Street worried about whether profit margins for the Mag Seven hit a short-term peak in 2024.
Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are slated to spend a cumulative $325 billion in capital expenditures and investments this year, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports. This would mark a 46% increase year over year for the four tech stalwarts.
Amazon alone sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above prior analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion.
RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson warned last week Mag Seven names such as Amazon are ""crowded"" trades and that the ""AI 'spend money to make money' debate will undoubtedly continue.""
The question now beginning to circulate on the Street is if Mag Seven weakness bleeds into the broader market. If so, it could have an outsized impact on stocks not directly tied to tech.
The combined weighting of the Mag Seven within the S&P 500 surged from 21.9% in 2020 to over 30% in 2024, the highest concentration ever recorded, according to data from First Trust.
""While the main S&P 500 index has been able to hold up incredibly well in the face of the Mag 7 weakness, should the market get further concerning news on tariffs, and/or inflation, the indices could be susceptible for a much larger decline than we have seen thus far given the overall weakness from the top-weighted names. In addition, should these names remain under pressure that likely puts a 'cap' to the index upside in the shorter-term given their importance,"" explains 22V Research strategist Jeff Jacobson.
A near-term test for the Mag Seven bulls will come with Feb. 26 earnings from Nvidia, says Jacobson.

54,2025-02-10,"Democrats protested outside the agency where work has come to a standstill.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent agency formed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to safeguard Americans against unfair business practices, is the newest target of Elon Musk and the Trump administration.
The agency is at a virtual standstill after Musk's Department of Government Efficiency and Russell Vought, the leader of the White House budget office and now acting director of the CFPB, took control.
They and congressional Republicans have accused the agency of overreach and not being politically accountable.
Internal emails obtained by ABC News show Vought advised the agency's headquarters in Washington will be closed all week and told employees, ""Please do not perform any work tasks.""
In a post on X Saturday night, Vought said the CFPB's funding, which comes through the Federal Reserve, is ""now being turned off.""
Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who helped create the CFPB, posted a video on Monday ""ringing the alarm bell"" on what the impact will be if its gutted.
Warren highlighted what she said the agency does for average Americans, including finding fraud in payment apps, stepping in if a bank tries to repossess your car and working to cut credit card fees. She argued that only Congress can dismantle the CFPB, and that Trump and Musk do not have the authority to do so unilaterally.
""So, why are these two guys trying to gut the CFPB? It's not rocket science: Trump campaigned on helping working people, but now that he's in charge, this is the payoff to the rich guys who invested in his campaign and who want to cheat families -- and not have anybody around to stop them. Yeah, it's another scam,"" she said.
Later Monday, Warren and other congressional Democrats led a protest outside the agency.
""The CFPB is the little agency that has fought for us, and we are here today to fight for the CFPB.,"" Warren told the crowd, calling the agency the ""cop on the beat.""
""Donald Trump ran his campaign on lowering costs for working families. Yeah, now he and his co-president Elon Musk,have tried to shut down the agency that has delivered $21 billion to hard working families, $21 billion to people who got cheated and Trump and Musk want to Just take that agency away,"" Warren said.
Here is what to know about the agency and its work.
The CFPB is an independent agency established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. It's a consumer watchdog aimed at protecting American households from unfair and deceptive practices across the financial services industry.
Its oversight applies to everything from mortgages to credit cards to bank fees to student loans. By law, the CFPB has the rare ability to issue new rules -- and impose fines against companies who break them.
Since its establishment in 2011, the CFPB says it has clawed back $20.7 billion for American consumers.
Unlike many federal agencies that are beholden to appropriations battles in Congress, the CFPB's funding comes through the Federal Reserve system. This has made it a frequent target by Republicans and industry groups. Last summer, the Supreme Court ruled the CFPB's source of funding is constitutional.
Under the Biden administration, the CFPB took aggressive steps to take on big players in the banking and financial services industries -- issuing regulations that aimed to put money back in the pockets of tens of millions of Americans.
In December, it finalized a rule that would cap most bank overdraft fees at $5 (right now those fees can be as high as $35 per transaction). The agency said that would save the typical household $225 per year, or about $5 billion in total. That rule was set to take effect October 1, 2025 -- but its fate is now in limbo given the work stoppage order from acting director Vought.
The CFPB also finalized a rule in January that would wipe medical debt from Americans' credit reports. The agency estimated that would affect roughly 15 million Americans with $49 billion in unpaid medical bills on their credit reports. The change, set to take effect in March, is currently on hold as it faces legal challenges. A similar rule capping credit card late fees is also in legal limbo.
Beyond issuing new rules, the CFPB also addresses direct complaints from consumers who might have been scammed on everything from credit cards to cryptocurrency to car loans.
The 2008 recession exposed how many Americans were left vulnerable in the unregulated subprime mortgage market. One of the key goals of the CFPB was to oversee the ""nonbank mortgage market."" In other words, this applies to homebuyers who take out mortgages through independent lenders that aren't banks.
According to the CFPB, nonbank lenders account for 65% of all mortgages in the U.S. in a market worth $13 trillion.
In practice, what this means is that the CFPB monitors and keeps tabs on nonbank lenders to try to ensure they aren't deceiving or ripping off customers.
The agency also supervises banks and credit unions holding more than $10 billion in assets, accounting for more than 80% of the banking industry's total assets. This includes banks like JPMorgan, Citigroup and Bank of America. Other federal agencies like the Fed, FDIC and Office of the Comptroller also regulate banks.

56,2025-02-10,"GERMANY - 2024/12/16: In this photo illustration, the General Electric logo seen displayed on a ... [+] monitor. (Photo Illustration by Valera Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)
On February 6, Honeywell – the Charlotte, N.C.-based conglomerate operating in industries such as aerospace, building automation, industrial automation, and energy and sustainability solutions – announced plans to split into three companies to boost stock returns, according to MarketWatch.
Since then, the company’s shares have fallen 10%. Is the drop due to investors’ dislike of the break up or disappointment about the company’s revenue and earnings guidance?
Honeywell’s announcement about splitting into three comes after pressure from a so-called activist investor. While the split up of GE seems to be working finally, many such breakups fall short of the hoped-for value.
Will Honeywell’s breakup plan unlock value? Elliott Investment Management sees the stock increasing as much as 75% in the next two years. However, analysts are more pessimistic about the company’s stock and important questions – see below – remain unanswered.
After its share price under-performed the market – up 8.3% in the last year while the S&P 500 index added 22.6%, according to MarketWatch – Honeywell announced plans to split into three companies. The same day the company released a mixed financial report – exceeding investors’ fourth quarter 2024 expectations and delivering a disappointing forecast.
By the second half of 2026, Honeywell plans to separate its automation and aerospace technologies businesses and to complete the spin off its advanced-materials unit. Activist investor Elliott Investment Management called for the split last fall, estimating the breakup could “push the stock up 51% to 75% over the next two years,” noted MarketWatch.
Honeywell’s CEO plans to heed Elliott’s call. These three independent companies will build “on the powerful foundation we have created, positioning each to pursue tailored growth strategies and unlock significant value for shareholders and customers,” Honeywell CEO Vimal Kapur said, according to MarketWatch.
Honeywell’s Q4 financial report included the following key numbers:
There are very few conglomerates like GE and Honeywell left. To be sure, other companies are in the middle of breaking themselves into pieces.
DuPont plans to spin off its electronics business by the end of 2025 – forming two companies. Moreover, auto parts maker Aptiv is breaking into two: a software and services provider for multiple industries and an electrical systems maker for car companies, noted Barron’s.
Moreover, conglomerates can take a long time to unwind and to demonstrate whether their breakups were successful.
For example, in the early 2000s, I wrote often about the concept of the conglomerate discount — namely a basket of companies in unrelated industries were worth less than the sum of their parts (meaning what the distinct business would be worth if they were independent companies).
In 2007, I met with GE's chief financial officer, and he asked me what GE could do to increase the value of its stock.
I told him GE should sell off all the businesses with moderate to low profit potential where GE lacked a competitive advantage and use the proceeds to build the businesses in industries with high profit potential and strong competitive positions — such as Aircraft Engines.
GE eventually achieved the idea I had in mind and the change is now perceived as having been very successful.
GE’s aerospace, energy and healthcare units are now stand-alone businesses that, together, have a market value nearly four-times bigger than GE had in 2022. The aerospace unit alone has a value of around $215 billion, which is more than double that of pre-breakup GE, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Behind the rising value of the GE’s spin-offs is their increased earnings. For example, GE Vernova, the power business, added three percentage points to its operating margins last year and investors expect another three-percentage-point increase in 2025. Meanwhile the company’s earnings per share are expected to soar 50% a year for the next two years while sales rise at a near 10% annual rate, noted Barron’s.
Although GE HealthCare has not performed as well – the business is expanding margins and growing earnings at about 10% a year – GE Aerospace is expecting almost 20% a year earnings growth as its profit margins rise by three percentage points in 2024, Barron’s wrote.
I think the logic behind the breakup of conglomerates has been widely accepted for decades — however, well-established conglomerates with long-tenured executives in top positions are very reluctant to move. It takes outside agitation and – in the case of GE – an outsider CEO to implement the changes.
The record on the value of breakups is mixed — conglomerates such as United Technologies, Danaher and Alcoa enjoyed stronger performances and higher multiples after splitting.
However, a Bain & Company study of 350 public spin-offs between 2000 and 2020 found 50% of them had not created more shareholder value two years after the splits and 25% suffered a value erosion, noted the Journal.
To get a payoff from the spin-offs, requires a combination of luck and management skill. Here are the key questions that must be answered in the affirmative:
Were Honeywell split up, its price-earnings ratio could be higher. Based on comparable firms, the weighted average PE of the three Honeywells could be about 28 times – eight more than Honeywell’s PE on 2025 estimated earnings, reported Barron’s.
Investors will have to wait – likely until late 2026 to know whether Honeywell investors will benefit from this estimated increase in the company’s weighted average PE.
Wall Street analysts see a decent rise ahead for Honeywell stock. Based on 17 analysts offering 12-month price targets for the company, the share price could rise about 19.4% were the stock to reach the average price target of $245.31, TipRanks noted.
If I were considering whether to invest in Honeywell stock, I would try to answer the three questions I mentioned above for each of its three spinoff companies.
To be sure, as an independent business Honeywell’s aerospace technologies business could be worth “about $104 billion,” reported Axios. The business grew faster than the rest in 2024 – accounting for 40% of Honeywell’s revenue, growing 13%, and earning a 22.6% segment margin, according to Honeywell’s earnings release.
Moreover, as an independent company, the aerospace unit would be “one of the largest aerospace suppliers,” noted the Journal. The company’s other business units either grew more slowly or shrank last year.
Until 2026 when more answers to those questions become clearer, the company could continue to report slower-than-expected growth. That may create a lower entry point for investors who believe Elliott’s thesis about the three Honeywell stocks.

Pinterest stock (NYSE: PINS) recently released its Q4 results, with revenue slightly above but earnings missing the street estimates. It reported sales of $1.15 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.56 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $1.14 billion and $0.64, respectively. However, a solid growth in user base and upbeat outlook resulted in its stock surging 19% on Friday, February 7. Separately, after a bleak outlook, Should You Pick Bristol Myers Squibb Stock At $57?
PINS stock, with 8% returns since the beginning of 2024, has underperformed the S&P 500 index, up 26%. Increased operational costs have tapered the company’s profitability, contributing to a weakness in its share price performance over the last year. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.
Pinterest’s revenue of $1.15 billion in Q4 reflected an 18% y-o-y growth, with Europe seeing a 21% rise and the U.S. and Canada up 16%. The top-line growth was led by a rise in monthly active users (MAUs) as well as average revenue per user. While MAUs were up 11% to 553 million, ARPU was up 6% $2.12. Notably, both of these metrics were better than the street estimates. Not only did Pinterest post a strong sales growth, its adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 300 bps to 41% in Q4. The company’s earnings of $0.56 per share were slightly above the $0.53 figure seen in the prior-year quarter.
Looking forward, the company guided for $845 million in sales and adjusted EBITDA of $163 million in Q1, at the mid-point of the provided range. This outlook fares much better than the consensus estimate of $834 million and $139 million, respectively.
Although Pinterest posted a mixed Q4, its stock has trended higher, amid a solid outlook and strong user engagement. But, if we look at a slightly longer period, the changes in PINS stock over the recent years have been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500.
In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and trade wars, could PINS underperform the S&P or will it see higher levels? At its current levels of $40, PINS stock is trading at 7.7x trailing revenues, marginally higher than the stock’s average P/S ratio of 7.3x over the last four years. Despite Pinterest’s recent stock gains, we believe further upside potential exists, supported by robust user growth, rising ARPU, and margin expansion. These improving fundamentals justify a premium to the stock’s historical valuation multiple. As an aside, rallying on a good quarter, see What’s Happening With AFRM Stock?
While PINS stock looks like it has more room for growth, it is helpful to see how Pinterest’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

60,2025-02-10,"Today’s Apple deals are ready to go, and there’s a whole bunch of them. This weekend we got hit with some notable price drops across the current-generation iPad lineup, including $100 discounts on the new iPad mini 7 as well as up to $200 off the M2 iPad Air and a return low on the most affordable 13-inch M4 iPad Pro at $200 off. Those offers join up to $400 off the original prices on M3 MacBook Air configs, Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals, and the return of Black Friday pricing on Apple Pencil Pro. All of that and more awaits below in today’s 9to5Toys Lunch Break.
A couple weeks ago we saw   $100 price drops finally make a return across Apple’s latest iPad mini 7 lineup, and those deals are back again today. This is on par with the best prices we have tracked on the new A17 Pro-equipped miniature iPad lineup and today Amazon is giving folks another chance to score one at the lowest we have tracked since release back in October. Pricing  kicks off at  $399 shipped with $100 discounts across all storage capacities as well as the Wi-Fi + Cell models.
Amazon is now offering the 128GB model at   $399  , the 256GB at   $499, and the 512GB configuration at   $699, down from the regular $499, $599, and $799 sticker prices, respectively.
Just after  reports of M3 MacBook Air stock beginning to  dwindle at Apple Stores began to surface, Amazon has now brought back its  $200 price drops across the  13-inch and  15-inch models. While not all colors are in-stock you will find several 16GB and 24GB M3 MacBook Air configurations on sale starting from   $899 and   $1,099, respectively.
Today we are touching down to scope out some fresh new price drops on the flagship  Apple Watch Ultra 2. While we are tracking a big-time price drop on refurbished units we will detail down below, Amazon now has a large selection of  Natural Titanium Apple Watch Ultra 2 units on sale starting  from  $679.99 shipped, or $119 off the regular $799 list price. The lowest prices will be found on various colorways of the  Ocean Band configuration while a series of  Alpine Loop setups and others have now been dropped  down to  $699.99 shipped.
All of that said, you can save even more with refurbished units right now. While we tend to prefer recommending listings like the Best Buy Geek Squad options when it comes to refurbs, they are mostly sold out right now and this deal courtesy of Amazing Wireless on eBay is  worth mentioning at  $469.99 shipped. This is $329 off the regular new price and easily among the lowest prices we can find for an Ultra 2.

61,2025-02-10,"Bill Gates and Mark Cuban compare The Mavericks trading Luka Doncic to Microsoft trading Windows 11 for 10.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

When was the last time you heard someone compare sports and software development? I can't recall either. However, Dallas Mavericks’ minority owner, Mark Cuban, recently shared interesting insights about the team unceremoniously trading basketball superstar Luka Dončić trade to the Los Angeles Lakers in an interview with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates (via OpenCourt Basketball).
Mark Cuban jokes with Bill Gates about the Mavericks trading Luka Doncic:“If after you left the company, they traded Microsoft 11 for Microsoft 10… what would you do?” 💀(via @persources) pic.twitter.com/CrCYdokSJLFebruary 8, 2025
The interview started with Cuban posing a rhetorical question to Bill Gates:
""If after you left Microsoft, you found out that Steve Ballmer traded Windows 11, the new, hot operating system, for Windows 10, the Hall of Fame but the old operating system, what would you do.""

- Gates would start Microsoft again as an AI-centric firm
- Android co-founder blames Bill Gates for Microsoft losing a $400 billion opportunity
- Bill Gates claims AI will replace humans for most things
""I might have to hide from the press,"" responded Gates. The philanthropic billionaire's comments are warranted given Microsoft's history and rapid trajectory to become the most sought-after software development company with billions of users across the world and up to $3 trillion in market valuation.
As we recently learned, Microsoft's immense success didn't dawn on Bill Gates until the late '90s, despite attaining billionaire status.
""I thought I was one mistake away from death until then,"" added Gates. ""That was just my mentality.”

While Cuban raises a valid point on the basketball front, his sentiments might not be entirely valid on the Windows front. In the next 9 months, Microsoft is expected to pull the plug on Windows 10. October 14, 2025, could be around the corner, but Windows 10 continues to dominate with a 60.33% market share over Windows 11's 36.65% (the highest market share the new OS has enjoyed since shipping).
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
Despite Microsoft's blatant attempt to get users to upgrade to Windows 11 using intrusive and full-screen multipage popup ads, most users are seemingly sticking to their guns and continue to run the operating system, even with its imminent death looming closer.
Related: Windows 10 'doomsday clock' pushes closer to midnight as Microsoft's unexpected rivals dominate an expanding PC category
User reluctance to upgrade to Windows 10 can be attributed to several critical reasons, including the depressed PC market (though trends show it's on an upward trajectory this year), strict minimum system requirements for the OS, Windows 11's flawed design, and more.
A public interest research group filed a petition contesting Microsoft's decision to cut support for Windows 10. The group argued that over 40% of users still run Windows 10, citing that the plan would lead to ""the single biggest jump in junked computers ever,"" which doesn't align with the tech giant's sustainability goals.
But as it now seems, Microsoft is moving forward with its plans. However, users can continue using Windows 10 for an additional year of support through Microsoft's Extended Security Updates program for $30, though it only guarantees one year of extended support and security updates.
Beyond that, users will be compelled to upgrade to Windows 11 or continue using Windows 10 without support. The latter option leaves you susceptible to attacks.

Note: I've received a number of requests to post this again at the conclusion of President Biden's term.  So here is another update of tracking employment during Presidential terms.  We frequently use Presidential terms as time markers - we could use Speaker of the House, Fed Chair, or any other marker.

Important: There are many differences between these periods.  Overall employment was smaller in the '80s, however the participation rate was increasing in the '80s (younger population and women joining the labor force), and the participation rate is generally declining now.  But these graphs give an overview of employment changes.

The first graph shows the change in private sector payroll jobs from when each president took office until the end of their term(s).  Presidents Carter, George H.W. Bush, and Trump only served one term.

Mr. G.W. Bush (red) took office following the bursting of the stock market bubble and left during the bursting of the housing bubble.  Mr. Obama (dark blue) took office during the financial crisis and great recession.  There was also a significant recession in the early '80s right after Mr. Reagan (dark red) took office.

There was a recession towards the end of President G.H.W. Bush (light purple) term, and Mr. Clinton (light blue) served for eight years without a recession.   There was a pandemic related recession in 2020.

First, here is a table for private sector jobs.  The previous top two private sector terms were both under President Clinton.  



TermPrivate Sector
Jobs Added (000s)
Biden14,3451
Clinton 110,875
Clinton 210,104

Obama 11,889
GHW Bush1,507
GW Bush 2453
GW Bush 1-822
Trump-2,178
1End of Term



 Click on graph for larger image.

The first graph is for private employment only.
Private sector employment increased by 9,039,000 under President Carter (dashed green), by 14,714,000 under President Reagan (dark red), 1,507,000 under President G.H.W. Bush (light purple), 20,979,000 under President Clinton (light blue), lost 369,000 under President G.W. Bush, and gained 11,813,000 under President Obama (dark dashed blue).  During Trump's first term (Orange), the economy lost 2,178,000 private sector jobs.
 A big difference between the presidencies has been public sector employment.  Note: the bumps in public sector employment due to the decennial Census in 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020.  

The public sector grew during Mr. Carter's term (up 1,304,000), during Mr. Reagan's terms (up 1,414,000), during Mr. G.H.W. Bush's term (up 1,127,000), during Mr. Clinton's terms (up 1,934,000), and during Mr. G.W. Bush's terms (up 1,744,000 jobs).  However, the public sector declined significantly while Mr. Obama was in office (down 263,000 jobs).  During Trump's term, the economy lost 537,000 public sector jobs (mostly teachers during the pandemic).And a table for public sector jobs.  Public sector jobs increased have increased the most during Biden's term (mostly state and local employment), ahead of the number during Reagan's 2nd term.  Public sector jobs declined the most during Obama's first term.

64,2025-02-10,"Gold prices rose to yet another record high Monday, extending a yearslong rally for the precious metal accelerated in recent weeks as President Donald Trump’s tariffs upend global trade policy, and investors and central banks search for safety in the evolving global economy.
Gold is on a remarkable hot streak.
Spot gold rose to as high as $2,938 per troy ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange, rising as much as 1.7%.
Monday’s rally tied to Trump’s imposition of a blanket 25% tariff on all aluminum and tariff imports, the latest in a scorching stretch for gold.
Up 44% over the last year, gold has been by far the best-performer across a basket of 12 leading global asset classes over the period, according to the BlackRock Investment Institute, most notably trouncing the 22% return for the S&P 500 over the last year, including reinvested dividends.
And Wall Street largely believes the gains will continue: JPMorgan Chase maintains a $2.950 end-of-2025 price target for gold, Goldman Sachs holds a $3,000 target by the middle of 2026 and Citigroup has a $3,000 target by the end of this year.
Gold breaking $3,000, which would only require a less than 3% rally from Monday’s prices, would be the latest milestone for a roaring 2020s for gold, which only crossed $1,000 for the first time during 2008’s great financial crisis and $2,000 for the first time during 2020’s COVID-19 pandemic.
It’s rare for gold to have such a strong performance during a time of economic strength globally, especially in the U.S., which has many of the hallmarks of an economy far from recession with a resilient labor market, stock market highs and relatively stable inflation. Though long-held concerns about inflation and geopolitical tensions such as the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine and diminished interest rate cut prospects weigh on the minds of gold investors, experts mostly tie the recent gold rally to Trump’s tariffs. Gold “clearly would benefit from universal tariffs,” according to JPMorgan’s head of cross asset strategy Fabio Bassi, while Goldman commodities strategist Lina Thomas wrote of gold’s “potentially persistent boost from elevated US policy uncertainty.” And there’s a continued undercurrent of historic gold purchasing from central banks globally, as those institutions bought more than 1,000 tonnes of gold in 2024, the third consecutive year of at least 1,000 tonnes in central bank purchases after never crossing that mark prior to 2022, according to the World Gold Council. The People's Bank of China is the most notable buyer, accounting for 43% of all central bank gold purchases in November, according to Goldman. Central banks typically buy gold to safeguard against inflation or other deterioration of their home currencies.
Gold has unexpectedly become one of the hottest financial assets on the market despite being one of the oldest investments in human history. Gold and other commodities do not offer the same potential for dividends or other returned shareholder value like stocks or guaranteed annual interest payments like bonds, making the metal’s rise more stark.
Gold and bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency thought by some to be a new-school hedge against economic uncertainty, have gone on divergent paths since Trump announced the 25% tariffs on all Canadian and Mexican goods and a 10% additional tariffs on Chinese imports (the Canadian and Mexican levies were later delayed). Gold prices are up 2% since Trump signed the tariff executive order Feb. 1, while bitcoin is down 6%.

    A fixed APY lets you keep earning even if rates drop further.
  
Certificates of deposit offer the stability of reliable earnings, but you should always shop around for the best rates. The best CDs we track offer annual percentage yields, or APYs, up to 4.65%.
After cutting interest rates three times last year, the Federal Reserve left the federal funds rate alone in January. CD rates have remained steady since then, but that might not last. By opening a CD today, you can lock in a good rate regardless of where rates end up later in the year.
Here are some of the highest CD rates and how much you could earn by depositing $5,000.
Experts recommend comparing rates before opening a CD account to get the best APY possible. Enter your information below to get CNET's partners' best rate for your area.
The Federal Open Market Committee meets eight times a year to set the federal funds rate based on the health of the US economy. The Fed may raise interest rates to try to slow down inflation or lower them to stimulate spending. After cutting interest rates in 2024, the Fed paused any moves at its January meeting amid signs that inflation was inching back up again.
While the Fed doesn't directly set CD rates, banks generally set APYs according to the federal funds rate. CDs offer a fixed rate for a set period of time, so locking in a higher rate now can help protect your earnings if the Fed decides to lower interest rates in the coming months. 
But it only makes sense to lock in a rate when you know you won't need access to the money. Otherwise, if you have to cash out the CD before it matures, you could be hit with early withdrawal fees.
""Going with the highest APY makes a lot of sense, although you'll want to make sure you pick a maturity date that aligns with your situation,"" said Keith Spencer, CFP, founder and financial planner at Spencer Financial Planning.
💰You can earn up to 5% APY on the best high-yield savings accounts. Check out today's rates.
A competitive APY is important, but it's not the only thing you should consider. To find the right CD for you, weigh these things, too:
CNET reviews CD rates based on the latest APY information from issuer websites. We evaluated CD rates from more than 50 banks, credit unions and financial companies. We evaluate CDs based on APYs, product offerings, accessibility and customer service.
The current banks included in CNET's weekly CD averages include Alliant Credit Union, Ally Bank, American Express National Bank, Barclays, Bask Bank, Bread Savings, Capital One, CFG Bank, CIT, Fulbright, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, MYSB Direct, Quontic, Rising Bank, Synchrony, EverBank, Popular Bank, First Internet Bank of Indiana, America First Federal Credit Union, CommunityWide Federal Credit Union, Discover, Bethpage, BMO Alto, Limelight Bank, First National Bank of America and Connexus Credit Union.
*APYs as of Feb. 10, 2025, based on the banks we track at CNET. Earnings are based on APYs and assume interest is compounded annually.
**Weekly percentage increase/decrease from Feb. 3, 2025, to Feb. 10, 2025."
66,2025-02-10,"
    Mortgage rates have been holding steady recently, but this week's inflation data could rock the boat.
  
On Monday, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage was around 6.92%, according to Bankrate data, which is 0.19% lower than January's peak of 7.11%. Where rates go next hinges on the upcoming inflation report.
Last week, fresh labor data and ongoing news on tariffs were the key economic factors affecting rates. This week centers on inflation with January's Consumer Price Index set to be released on Wednesday morning. The big question is how that figure will influence the Federal Reserve's decisions about interest rates this year. The central bank recently announced a pause from the rate-cutting path it kicked off last fall in order to observe incoming economic data. 
If inflation shows signs of improvement, the Fed could cut rates as early as March, said Rob Cook of Discover Home Loans. ""However, the more likely outcome is that rates will stay near current levels for most of 2025,"" said Cook. 
The most recent employment report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed lower-than-expected unemployment. Meanwhile, economists are rightly concerned that President Donald Trump's threats to place sweeping tariffs on an array of US imports will increase consumer prices. Tariffs are also expected to negatively impact housing affordability, putting upward pressure on borrowing rates and the cost of building materials, like lumber, used to build new homes. 
The direction of mortgage rates ultimately depends on the economic impact of policies enacted by the Trump administration and the projected pace of interest rate cuts by the central bank. ""Markets will take their biggest cues from actual changes in economic data,"" said Matt Graham of Mortgage News Daily. 
If the labor market weakens with higher unemployment figures, or inflation nosedives, it could push bond yields down, translating to lower mortgage rates. Most economic forecasts call for a gradual decline in mortgage rates over the course of 2025, but not by much. Fannie Mae expects average 30-year fixed mortgage rates to hold above 6.5% until mid-2025. 
On Jan. 29, the Federal Reserve's decision-making body voted to pause its cuts on borrowing rates, leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said officials are waiting to see if inflation eases or the labor market softens and aren't hurrying to lower interest rates.  
As of now, experts project one or two rate cuts this year. ""There is a lot of change happening at the beginning of the new presidential term, and depending on policy, we could see inflation turn upward,"" said Nicole Rueth, SVP of the Rueth Team Powered by Movement Mortgage.
The Fed typically responds to high levels of inflation by hiking interest rates to slow the economy, as it did starting in early 2022. 
Though the Fed's monetary policy decisions only indirectly impact the mortgage market, higher inflation and steeper interest rates usually translate to more expensive mortgages for borrowers. 
Despite the president's claims that he would bring mortgage rates down to 3%, the White House doesn't set rates on home loans. Moreover, those kinds of rock-bottom pandemic-era rates would normally indicate that the country is in a severe economic crisis. 
If Trump's policies recharge inflation or boost government debt deficits, more affordable mortgages and housing will be difficult to achieve, particularly in time for the spring homebuying season. Here is where some of the major housing authorities expect mortgage rates to land this year. 
Even if mortgage rates do eventually come down, prospective homebuyers will still have to grapple with a long-standing housing shortage, expensive home prices and a loss of purchasing power due to inflation.
It's never a good idea to rush into buying a home without knowing what you can afford, so establish a clear home-buying budget. Here's what experts recommend before purchasing a home: 
💰 Build your credit score. Your credit score will help determine whether you qualify for a mortgage and at what interest rate. A credit score of 740 or higher will help you qualify for a lower rate.
💰 Save for a bigger down payment. A larger down payment allows you to take out a smaller mortgage and get a lower interest rate from your lender. If you can afford it, a down payment of at least 20% will also eliminate private mortgage insurance.
💰 Shop for mortgage lenders. Comparing loan offers from multiple mortgage lenders can help you negotiate a better rate. Experts recommend getting at least two to three loan estimates from different lenders.
💰 Consider renting. Choosing to rent or buy a home isn't just comparing monthly rent to a mortgage payment. Renting offers flexibility and lower upfront costs, but buying allows you to build wealth and have more control over your housing costs.
💰 Consider mortgage points. You can get a lower mortgage rate by buying mortgage points, with each point costing 1% of the total loan amount. One mortgage point equals a 0.25% decrease in your mortgage rate."
67,2025-02-10,"As Tesla CEO Elon Musk grows further embedded in the White House, his electric vehicle company’s public perception is weighing on the stock according to polling by investment research firm Stifel, which lowered its price target for Tesla due to pushback about Musk’s key role in the administration of President Donald Trump.
Elon Musk at the site of Tesla's Germany ""gigafactory"" in 2020. 
“The negative downturn in consumers' perception of Elon Musk…potentially results in a headwind to sales,” wrote Stifel analyst Stephen Gengaro in a Sunday note to clients.
Stifel lowered its price target for Tesla stock from $492 to $478 following the survey, maintaining a buy rating for Tesla and still indicating 33% upside from Tesla’s $360 share price Monday.
The adjustment came after a monthly survey conducted by Stifel and Morning Consult included in a Sunday note to Stifel clients revealed Tesla’s net favorability is 3%, close to the all-time low favorability dating back to the poll’s 2018 inception (net favorability compares the proportion of respondents with a positive view of Tesla minus those with a negative one).
That reflects increased skepticism about Musk’s political influence, as some consumers pull back from Tesla: A CBS News/YouGov survey released Sunday found just 23% of Americans believe Musk and his DOGE commission should have “a lot” of influence in the federal government.
And reports last week indicated a sharp drop in Tesla sales across Europe, including a near 12% January decline in the UK, a 59% January decline in Germany and a 63% January drop in France.
Shares of Tesla declined as much as 3% Monday following the Stifel report, before settling into a slimmer 0.5% daily loss by mid morning, moving against strong gains for technology stocks as the Nasdaq advanced more than 1%. Tesla notched its lowest share price since Dec. 4 on Monday. That extends Tesla’s year-to-date loss to 11%, as shares trade 26% below the all-time high set in December.
Musk’s net worth was $396 billion Monday, according to Forbes’ calculations. Though that’s still the most of any human, and more than $140 billion more than the next-richest person, Facebook cofounder Mark Zuckerberg, it’s a $58 billion decline from his record end-of-day net worth of $454.5 billion achieved Dec. 16.
Tesla reported its first year-over-year vehicle delivery decline on record last year, as its electric vehicle deliveries inched down from 2023’s 1.81 million to 1.79 million. The company’s financial performance was also down, as its below-expectations earnings report last month revealed Tesla’s profits declined more than 20% from 2023 to 2024. And yet, Tesla stock is up more than 90% over the last year, including a 43% gain since the November election. Tesla stock has “become completely divorced from the fundamentals,” skeptical JPMorgan analysts led by Ryan Brinkman remarked last month. To Brinkman’s point, Tesla’s price-to-earnings ratio, a commonly cited valuation metric comparing a firm’s market value to its profits over the last 12 months, is about 175, about seven times the median S&P 500’s company’s 24 price-to-earnings ratio.
Even Musk admits the tangible slowdown in Tesla’s core electric vehicle business, describing it last January as a bump between “two major growth waves.” Instead, the bullish thesis on Tesla rests largely on its prospects outside of merely selling its electric cars, including its leading efforts in applied artificial intelligence and its Full Self-Driving initiative. Stifel says Tesla’s AI efforts are “critical to the story” of Tesla stock, which it still holds a buy rating for, while Musk said last month he sees a $10 trillion market for the company’s Optimus humanoid robots.
“If you buy the stock, you have to accept that it’s not going to be like a regular company. It's Elon’s private company that is public for some reason,” Ross Gerber, CEO of the asset manager Gerber Kawasaki with a $100 million stake in Tesla, told Forbes.

The Trump administration's buyout offer to federal employees likely won't affect enough workers to have a immediate impact on the national job market, economists say.

        More than 65,000 federal employees accepted the deferred-resignation offer, according to the White House, which promises full pay and benefits through September to workers who stop working now.
    

        But 65,000 people entering the labor market is actually ""a quite small number,"" said Harry Holzer, a nonresident senior fellow in Economic Studies at Brookings Institute and a public policy professor at Georgetown.
    

        The U.S. economy adds about 200,000 jobs each month on average, Holzer said.
    

        Stan Veuger, a senior fellow in economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, noted that many of the people accepting the buyout offer are probably close to retirement.
    

        ""I don't think you can compare that 60,000 number to an actual 60,000 person layoff because so many people would've retired anyway,"" he told BI.
    

        And if they're not retiring, many taking the buyout will find employment elsewhere. ""Those who take such a deal are the ones who most want to leave the labor force or who are most likely to find other jobs,"" Orley Ashenfelter, an economics professor emeritus at Princeton, said.
    

        The impact will be felt more, Holzer said, if hundreds of thousands of federal workers enter the workforce. He also said the scale of the impacted jobs could grow with Trump administration cutting federal spending across the board, leading to federal contractors losing work and organizations losing their federal funding.
    

        ""With that number, much more quickly, you can get into scenarios where you feel it at the national labor market, and perhaps even a little more so in the DC region,"" Holzer said.
    

        The federal government dominates DC-area employment both directly and through contractor jobs. Because of that, the area is likely to see ""a large negative impact if the resignations actually happen,"" said John Abowd, an economics professor emeritus at Cornell.
    

        Beyond the impact on the labor market, Abowd noted that the loss of federal workers could disrupt the function of the government.
    

        ""Chaos is the short-term consequence,"" Abowd told BI. ""In the longer term, there is likely to be a severe deterioration in the quality of government services, especially in activities where government services are taken for granted: food and drug safety, transportation services, medical research, defense research and development.""
    

        Following a lawsuit filed last week, a federal judge extended the initial deadline for employees to accept the buyout offer from Thursday last week to Monday, when US District Judge George O'Toole in Boston will hear arguments from federal labor unions who say the offer is illegal.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Susan von Seggern, a 56-year-old publicist and CFO in Los Angeles. It has been edited for length and clarity.

        My grandmother indirectly helped me become financially smart by leaving me $10,000 when she died in 1993.
    

        While on her deathbed, she couldn't satiate her four grandchildren with sumptuous meals anymore, so she literally brought some fortune into our lives in her last bittersweet days.
    

        I was 25 but wise enough not to waste the money on something that would only gratify me for the short term.
    

        Instead, I bought a convertible I had been eyeing for a long time and devised a plan to save money for a future townhouse.
    

        They shaped my parents into people who'd spend their money only if absolutely necessary. My money foundation was based on spending and investing money wisely.
    

        In my early 20s, I drove an old Nissan Sentra around Los Angeles. I longed for a Geo Metro LSI convertible but knew that taking anything from the money I was making at that time as a publicist was impossible, and the only other option was going into debt. The risk of opting for either was greater than the happiness I would've experienced from buying this car.
    

        Once I received $10,000 from my grandmother, I sold my Nissan for $2,000 and combined that with my inheritance to buy the convertible. I'm so glad I bought the car I wanted with great features, not a car other people wanted me to buy. I chose a car based on my desire, budget, and preference.
    

        I kept saving this specific amount until the end of 1995 as if I were paying a car payment. I had a minimalist lifestyle, so I could save even more sometimes just by spending or not spending intelligently. All my drinks, parking, and business lunches were paid for due to having an expense account through work.
    

        Things just kept aligning financially for me after I used the inheritance. No matter what I wanted to buy, I'd find myself having that amount saved because of how I utilized my money and saved it.
    

        After saving for a few years, I set aside about $25,000 to cover the down payment, which was $17,500, for my first condo and other related expenses, such as moving and furniture. I bought the condo for $175,000 in 1995.
    

        My husband and I started a boutique PR agency together, which we ran until it was extinguished when the dot-com bubble burst and also due to the 9/11 recession. The condo's value increased gradually, and I secured a home-equity loan for $75,000. With that, I settled my agency debts.
    

        The condo's value accelerated to around $400,000, and my loan also increased to $225,000. I sold the condo in 2007 for $715,000, which wouldn't have been possible without my inheritance money.
    

        After I paid the agents and the bank, I was left with around $450,000, which I used to pay off my then-to-be fianc's debts, which were about $50,000.
    

        I put the $400,000 in a brokerage account and let it grow. When the pandemic hit, the market crashed, and we lost 10% of the total. 
    

        We bought a new home in 2021, paid a $160,000 down payment, and were left with $200,000. After purchasing and moving expenses, we had $160,000 left, which we put into our brokerage account again.
    

        We balanced our mortgage out every month with it and the profits we were generating. The equity value of our new house is around $300,000.
    

        We've been making use of the $100,000 for various purposes. We spent around $25,000 on our house, including a new roof, AC unit, and water heater. We also invested around $20,000 in my husband's startup and spent around $10,000 on medical purposes.
    

        Both my husband and I are still working. This inheritance is more than enough for us to handle our future and present personal and professional needs and wants.

The trade wars have hit the influencer economy.

        Halara, a women's activewear brand, said it was pausing some sponsorship campaigns until March, citing concerns about the business impact of new US tariffs, per an email sent to a talent manager and viewed by Business Insider.
    

        The fast-fashion retailer Shein informed one talent manager through an agency that it was temporarily pausing collaborative videos. It told another it was deferring new campaign offers, saying the move was specific to creators with US audiences. In both instances, the company cited the US tariffs as the reason for its pause.
    

        The talent managers spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their future business dealings. Their identities are known to BI.
    

        Fashion brands that rely on Chinese manufacturing are some of the first to be affected by President Donald Trump's tariff policies.
    

        In its email, Halara said it would spend the next few weeks changing its warehouse strategy to adapt to US tariff policies. The company advised its influencers not to shoot any videos before March, as the products they're meant to promote may change by that point.
    

        Halara and Shein did not respond to requests for comment from BI.
    

        Whether the pause affects some or all of the brands' US influencer-marketing spending was unclear.
    

        Halara, founded in 2020 by Joyce Zhang, has leaned heavily on social media and influencers to build its business. The company has a big presence on TikTok; it has sold about 125,000 items through the app's e-commerce feature, Shop. The company runs an ambassador program for influencers and offers affiliate commissions to creators who boost sales.
    

        Shein similarly leans on creators to drive up sales, sponsoring influencer trips and running an affiliate program offering up to 20% commissions.
    

        Trump, in a February 1 executive order, imposed an additional 10% tariff on all Chinese goods and a 25% tariff on items from Canada and Mexico. Tariffs on the latter two countries have been paused.
    

        Trump's order also removed a tax loophole known as the de minimis exemption that allowed brands like Shein and Temu to cheaply send goods to US consumers from China. Last week Trump delayed removal of the exemption to give the Commerce Department more time to prepare.
    

        Mylen Yamamoto Tansingco, the CEO of the influencer talent management firm Clique-Now, said her client's brand campaigns had not been directly affected by the tariffs. But she said she was ""anticipating a snowball effect"" where increased pricing leads to less consumer spending, which then lowers marketing budgets.
    

        Influencer marketers aren't the only ones in the industry bracing for impact.
    

        The creator agency The Network Effect works with a Chinese manufacturer for its Beyond Lost streetwear brand, founded by the influencer Alyssa McKay. The agency's cofounder Brian Nelson said the political back-and-forth posed daily worries.
    

        ""Currently we have a pretty big shipment for us on a boat on the way over"" via UPS, Nelson said. ""If any of this kicks into gear with China, we don't even know who pays what when it gets here.""
    

        The Network Effect is seeking to diversify its manufacturing partners and plans to eat any immediate tariff-related costs. But Nelson said the business ""wouldn't be fine in a long-term scenario"" without changes.
    

        Canada is also an open question for the agency — though tariffs are paused — as it is Beyond Lost's second-biggest consumer market after the US. (Goods ship from its Chinese manufacturer to the US and then to Canada upon sale.)
    

        ""You have to look at the headlines every day to kind of see where the hockey puck's moving,"" Brian Mandler, the agency's other cofounder, said.

Many of America's biggest businesses are quietly lobbying to curb President Donald Trump's plan to deport millions of immigrants — workers who represent a large share of their labor force. And some involved in the campaign are deploying a phrase designed to appeal to Trump and his business-minded allies: Make America Wealthy Again.

        Business Insider learned of the MAWA campaign from nearly two dozen industry lobbyists, corporate executives, and trade association leaders, most of whom discussed their efforts on the condition of anonymity. The message — directed at officials in the Trump administration, along with Republicans in Congress — is that mass deportations would cripple the economy, driving up prices for everything from groceries to housing.
    

        ""Trump as a businessman understands that if he doesn't have 200 guys cutting the grass at his golf courses, then they don't look right, and people won't want to play golf there,"" says Cristina Antelo, the founding principal at Ferox Strategies, a lobbying firm that counts the National Retail Federation, Walmart, and the tobacco giant Reynolds America among its clients. ""There's a way to get to Trump and make him realize that. How many businesses does he need to hear from before he's like, 'Crap, I really am going to paralyze the entire US labor market if I do this'?""
    

        So far, Trump's immigration raids have focused mostly on migrants accused of committing crimes since entering the country. But the prospect of widespread busts on farms and factories has rattled the business community, which relies heavily on migrant labor in areas such as agriculture, meatpacking, and construction. The MAWA plan is to apply pressure on business allies in Trump's inner circle, rather than on the president directly, and to steer clear of Stephen Miller, the administration's most outspoken anti-immigration hard-liner. ""Stephen Miller won't ever be convinced. Forget that,"" says a lobbyist from a prominent trade association. ""But Trump can be convinced not to screw over fellow businesspeople. Miller isn't the only dude who has Trump's ear.""
    

        Instead, according to multiple lobbyists, they'll seek to influence Brooke Rollins, Trump's pick to lead the Department of Agriculture, and Kristi Noem, his secretary of Homeland Security. Both are longtime business advocates, and Noem served as governor of South Dakota, home to migrant-dependent industries like beef processing and dairy.
    

        In addition, lobbyistshave already begun reaching out to members of Congress and their staffs — both on Capitol Hill and in their districts back home — via phone, Zoom, and in-person meetings. Several lobbyists describe a campaign of ""shock and awe,"" one that will seek to apply ""1,000 points of pressure"" to GOP members of Congress who understand that immigrants are willing to take low-paying, high-risk jobs that are shunned by most Americans. Among those being targeted is Rep. Glenn Thompson of Pennsylvania, who chairs the House Agriculture Committee.
    

        Despite Trump's hardline rhetoric on immigration, corporate lobbyists are confident that he'll reconsider the sweeping scope of his crackdown. ""There's one thing Trump cares more about than keeping his mass deportation promise, and that's the economy,"" says one longtime corporate lobbyist. ""He won't let it go to hell over something he controls.""
    

        For years, one of America's leading advocates for pro-immigration policies was the US Chamber of Commerce, which saw migrants as a source of cheap and pliable labor. As the country's largest lobbying group, the Chamber championed policies to expand guest worker programs and create paths for workers to gain legal status.
    

        Over the past decade, as Trump made immigration crackdowns a signature issue, the Chamber pivoted away from its advocacy for migrants. But one former Chamber official tells BI that the business alliance — and its lobbying juggernaut — was seeking to serve as a moderating force on the issue. He said leadership at the Chamber was actively pressing lawmakers and Trump officials to avoid immigration enforcement actions that could hurt big business. (Neither the Chamber nor the White House responded to a request for comment.)
    

        Officials at two other leading business associations say their organizations are also part of the ""quiet caucus"" of influential lobbying groups that are pressing Trump allies to help convince the president that mass deportations would damage his economic agenda.
    

        Some of the MAWA lobbyists believe they can even persuade Trump to back the sort of comprehensive immigration reform that he torpedoed during his campaign. Such legislation, they say, could involve cracking down on border security in exchange for granting business-friendly concessions — including a pathway to citizenship for taxpaying immigrants with jobs, and more work visas for seasonal laborers and high-tech talent from Europe and Asia.
    

        Whatever form the measures take, lobbyists are making their influence felt on immigration. ""There will be negotiations,"" says Dan McFaul, a partner at Ballard Partners, a powerhouse lobbying firm with ties to Trump and his top advisors. The guiding principle, he says, is the essence of Washington politics: ""What is the art of the possible?""
    

        Many corporate lobbyists view Trump himself as their best ally in reversing his most extreme positions on immigration. ""He's pretty pragmatic about how he approaches issues at the end of the day,"" says Rich Gold, a partner at Holland & Knight, whose lobbying clients range from the National Mining Association to the government of West Palm Beach, near Trump's home at Mar-a-Lago. Lobbyists note, for example, that it took only two days for Trump — amid a massive outcry from business leaders — to reverse course and delay a planned 25% tariff on Mexico.
    

        ""There's no way Trump is going all the way on immigration,"" says a lobbyist whose firm represents a dozen industries in a wide range of sectors. ""He's loud, but he's not dumb.""

75,2025-02-10,"The status quo for Founding Engineer compensation is broken. It’s unfair, outdated, and doesn’t work for founders or engineers.
A startup starts with the founders doing all the work. The founders write all the code and they talk to all the customers. If the startup is doing well, there is more coding and talking to do than the hours in the day, and you need to hire some help. This help will almost always be a technical hire.
The job title “Founding Engineer” was invented to describe this role. It is kinda-sorta like a founder, but not a founder. You do similar work to a founder, but a little bit less. You take on similar risk to the founder, but a little bit less.
This is all fine, except for one part. These roles offer similar compensation to the founders, except it’s a whole lot less.
The exact numbers vary, but the typical equity grants for founding engineers are in the range of 0.5% to 2%. You can get a sense for it if you scan YC’s job board. Getting 1% is typical, and it comes with a one year cliff and a four year vest. These grants are given to the first one or two engineering hires, and many of these companies have YC as their first and only investor.
Assuming two founders and a 7% stake by YC, the founders retain 48.5% equity. That means their stake is anywhere from 25x to 80x larger than the Founding Engineer’s stake.
To illustrate this in dollar terms, consider an acquihire exit. At 1% of $10 million, the acquihire nets the Founding Engineer around $100,000, enough to buy a nice Tesla. Meanwhile, the founders net $4.8 million, enough to buy a house in Palo Alto, a small yacht, and two nice Teslas.
The founders certainly took on more risk, but not 80 times more. The risk reward ratio is completely out of proportion, and it's profoundly unfair to the Founding Engineer.

Even if you ignore the reward proportions, there’s another problem with startup equity: liquidity.
Most startups put a one year cliff on your vesting, which means if you work there for 11 months and 29 days, you don’t get any equity at all.
But even once you start vesting, there’s another problem: you can’t sell your equity. There are no market makers for a typical startup's equity, which means there are no buyers and no sellers. You could try a second market deal, but even for Series A startups those markets are slow. Good luck trying to sell pre-seed shares.
Even mature startups have thin liquidity. When I worked at 23andMe, we had a once a year liquidity event, and you had to sell a large number of shares with high fees. If you missed the event, you had to wait a whole year before you could sell again.
Many VCs will tell you this is for “long term alignment” and to “maintain incentives.” It’s all shenanigans. These are the exact same VCs that happily jumped into failed crypto projects for short term gains (or cashed out successful crypto pumps by dumping on retail). Don’t believe their lies. With VCs, it’s “long term alignment” for you, and “cash now” for them.
This equity model works in some situations. It works in when the founders are bringing 50x more value than the Founding Engineer, for example:
If one of these applies to your startup, then you are justified in offering 50x lower equity to founding engineers. But if you are in the vast majority of startups that do not fall in these buckets, your equity offering is out of line with the risk-reward for a Founding Engineer.
This equity model does not work for tiny, no-name startups, like FetchFox.
Here at FetchFox, we very much want to hire great engineers. Our goal is to build a super reliable, easy to use system on top of two super unreliable, flakey systems: LLMs and proxies. This is hard. We run into subtle errors and difficult to reproduce bugs. We are competing against larger teams with more funding and huge incumbents. We need engineers who can frame problems well, figure out leveraged solutions, make good tradeoffs, apply both intuition and empiricism, and quickly write high quality code.
The great engineers we want to hire are always in demand, and they are super rare. They have the option to work at FetchFox, or they have the option to work at OpenAI for the same salary. When they see a 1% equity offer, conventional wisdom tells them to discount it down to zero after accounting for risk and time horizon. Meanwhile, the 0.005% equity offer from OpenAI will buy them a nice house in Palo Alto.
There are intangible benefits to working at an early stage startup like FetchFox: perhaps you want to own an entire component of the project, perhaps you enjoy the early stage startup experience, or perhaps you just like the vibe of the team. But these intangible benefits are stacked against the very tangible realities of cash compensation and exit liquidity.
FetchFox is inventing a new model for Founding Engineer compensation. Our goal is to solve the problems with the current model from above: disproportionate stake, and improbable liquidity.
First, we are dramatically increasing the stake that Founding Engineers receive. Generally we offer between 5% stake on the low end to 25% or more on the high end to the first few engineering hires. There is some tradeoff here with cash compensation. We believe this is a much more fair range that accounts for the risk and expected contribution for Founding Engineers.
Second, we are changing the vesting structure. We do have a vesting system, but you begin vesting your stake almost immediately upon joining the company. We do not have a one year cliff, and your stake does not expire if you leave the company.
Third, and most significant, we do not offer equity stakes using conventional instruments. We do not offer stock or options or equity in the traditional sense. Instead, we offer a crypto token. This is a utility token that will be deployed under the ERC-20 standard, and live on the Ethereum blockchain. It will be set up so that if the product does well, the price of the token goes up, and if the product does badly, the price of the token goes down. You can read more about the details of the token in a sister article.
Finally, the founders and employees get exactly the same crypto token. Only difference is that the founders get a larger allocation of that token. In my case, I am taking $0 salary at FetchFox and my entire upside and compensation is through the token that me and Founding Engineers are getting.
As far as I know, very very few, if any, startups outside the crypto space use tokens for employee compensation. I believe this is out of habit, not rational analysis, and I predict that in the future, many many startups outside the crypto space will use tokens for employee compensation.
Using a crypto token gives our employees a very important, 10x improvement over traditional stock grants. A crypto token enables continuous, 24/7 liquidity within the first months of the startup's life. No more waiting for a liquidity event that is contingent on the founders needs: you can sell anytime from day one.
Due to the unique structure of crypto AMM’s, any crypto token has infinite depth. Yes, infinite depth. A crypto AMM can absorb a token sale of any size, any time, zero sweat. It might not be at a price you like, but the option is there. If you haven’t read about them, I highly recommend learning about the math and intuition behind crypto AMM curves.
What crypto AMM’s offer is better than the liquidity you get at a brand name startup (it comes a few times a year at best), better than you get on second markets (which have high fees and takes weeks to close), and even better than the gold standard of an IPO (these are closed on weekends, and have nasty employee lockout periods).
While I strongly believe that a crypto token is a 10x better model for early stage startups, there are downsides. Any innovation that is 10x better in some dimension is 10x worse in another. Let's consider some of the downsides of the crypto token model.
First, granting a large amount of equity creates a signalling problem. If all the other startups are giving 1%, and FetchFox is giving up to 25%, does that mean FetchFox is a worthless company? It doesn’t, but many people will conclude it is.
Second, early stage startups are very volatile, and small cap crypto tokens are also volatile. Combine these two and you get volatility squared. This may create upset employees who could see their token grant values go up or down an order of magnitude overnight.
Finally, there is still a reputation risk associated with crypto. Mentioning crypto will set off alarm bells for some people, and it will often derail conversations because of its association with all manner of scammers.
Fortunately, these downsides are a necessary and worthwhile tradeoff. They are mostly related to perceptions (or misperceptions), and much of the impact can be mitigated by managing expectations. And remember that a startup should make a small group of people very happy. It should not make everyone mildly ok.
I recently told the CEO of a recruiting agency about this compensation model. She told me that if you even mention crypto, more than half your engineering candidates will immediately say “no” to your company. The word triggers people, and many will wonder if you’re trying to pull some kind of get rich quick scheme. Even rational people will decide the risk model is not for them, or they don’t want to be guinea pigs on a new compensation model.
However, we don’t need to hire lots of people here at FetchFox. We just need a handful of really great engineers. I am betting there is a niche group of great engineers who will view this compensation as a huge big positive, and be excited to join us.
If that describes you, please email marcell@fetchfoxai.com to chat about joining the team.

We recently published a list of 10 Mid-Cap IT Stocks Outperforming The Market In 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Kyndryl Holdings Inc. (NYSE:KD) stands against other mid-cap IT stocks outperforming the market in 2025.
US Stocks continue their recovery from a post-DeepSeek and post-tariffs period as nerves surrounding Donald Trump’s unpredictable policies calm down. The Nasdaq is surging 1.19% followed by the S&P 500 at 0.64%. The bullishness is expected to continue for the remainder of the day.
To determine which stocks could outperform the market in the coming months, it is essential to look at sectors that are benefitting from ongoing trends. IT stocks are unique in a way that with time, all companies have to spend more to keep their systems updated. Analysts expect companies to add 5% to their IT budgets in 2025. This, together with the increasing demand for AI products, will propel the sector’s returns in 2025.
Some companies have already started the year on a positive note. There are companies that are seeing increasing demand for their innovative products while others continue to serve the infrastructure involved in deploying these innovative solutions. Either way, it is important to look at what’s driving these stocks.
We decided to take a look at the top 10 mid-cap IT stocks that are outperforming the market in 2025. To come up with our list, we only considered stocks with a market cap of at least $10 billion with the highest return since the start of the year.
A group of engineers in a data center, ensuring IT resiliency.
Kyndryl Holdings Inc. is an IT infrastructure services provider that offers core enterprise & zCloud services, digital workplace services, network & edge services, cloud services, and other services. It provides its services to technology, retail & travel, financial, automotive, and media & telecom industries. The stock is up 20% this year but has already doubled in the last year.
Kyndryl has signed several important deals in 2024, essentially driving the optimism behind the stock. While a $2 billion agreement was the highlight of the year, nearly a dozen other deals amounting to over $100 million each have made investors realize the company can make consistent and stable income. The CEO believes this response from the company is proof that the company’s investments and vision are bearing fruit. As IT systems grow more and more complex by the day, Kyndryl’s ability to manage these systems will become increasingly relevant.
Despite shrinking revenues, the company was able to increase its gross profit, which suggests active efforts to run the business more efficiently. A healthy and growing cash flow, together with short-term liquidity of $4.5 billion, position the company strongly for a good year ahead.
Overall, KD ranks 4th on our list of mid-cap IT stocks outperforming the market in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of KD as a leading AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as KD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The fundraisers for the biggest hedge funds in the industry — names like Citadel, Millennium, and Point72 — may not want to hear this, but what these managers do isn't magic or rocket science.

        The work these funds do, especially the individual portfolio managers and their analysts, is something many could do. Or at least that's the belief of Marc Greenberg, the former director of research at Steve Cohen's Point72.
    

        Greenberg launched a consulting firm called Greener Pastures that works with smaller funds on talent development and their research process, and he writes a Substack that covers the ""block-and-tackle-type stuff"" of investing at a multistrategy hedge fund.
    

        It's a ""false notion"" that ""there's this secret sauce that happens within funds,"" he said, adding that the lore of the founders can make these firms seem magical from the outside.
    

        The reality, he said, is that PMs ""work really hard and know their companies really well."" He writes about earnings prep, how to use data, how to manage risk, and how to do fundamental research — and the success of these managers is driven by ""the men and the women in the seats.""
    

        Greenberg is part of a group of former investors and executives from these multistrategy funds who are trying to make the industry more accessible to those unfamiliar with the inner workings of a Millennium or a Citadel.
    

        Brett Caughran, a former portfolio manager for Schonfeld, Citadel, and D. E. Shaw, founded a training academy, Fundamental Edge, in 2022 with the explicit purpose of training young people in finance for jobs at multistrategy funds. Doug Garber, a former analyst at Citadel and portfolio manager at Millennium, launched a podcast called ""Pitch the PM,"" where he reviews stock pitches as he would if he were still investing for the hedge fund founders Ken Griffin or Izzy Englander.
    

        As the hedge fund industry has matured and more capital has concentrated among the biggest players, there's a growing demand for talent to keep it all running.
    

        The lack of talent has led to bidding wars that rival free agency in major sports leagues. Goldman Sachs' prime brokerage desk said in a recent report that pass-through fees, which cover expenses like bringing on big recruits, were 4% of assets in 2024 — a jump from 3.3% the prior year. In a recent bond offering prospectus, Citadel noted that investors paid $17 billion in pass-through fees from 2021 through mid-2024.
    

        Cohen, the owner of MLB's New York Mets, has dealt with both, doling out the largest deal in sports history to the outfielder Juan Soto and a guarantee of $50 million to lure the Marshall Wace PM Kevin Liu to Point72.
    

        It's not just a shortage of top-tier talent. These funds need more young analysts to support their ever growing ranks of PMs.What these new consultants, writers, and podcasters are doing is putting the brands of the biggest funds on the radar of smart young people considering their next move — and laying out what life is like at these funds.
    

        ""There's definitely a demand for it,"" said Garber, who's mentoring young investors who are in college and leaving grad programs. This next generation is eager to work for some of the industry's biggest names, he said, but ""they don't know the long-short process.""
    

        ""The students I talk to, they want Citadel or Point72,"" he said.
    

        It's not uncommon for people to leave hedge funds — which often recruit ambitious, entrepreneurial types — and start their own business, even if it isn't another investment manager. Kirk McKeown, who was Point72's research head, cofounded a data startup called Carbon Arc in 2021. The onetime Citadel and Millennium comms leader Tripp Kyle and the former AQR spokesperson Claudia Gray partnered to start their external agency, Northport Partners, in 2023. Claire Jolly, Elliott's former European government affairs leader, started the consultancy Beaufort Strategy last year.
    

        But those businesses and many that came before them are focused on serving the needs of those already in the industry, not looking to bring people into hedge funds. Greenberg, Caughran, and Garber are, in a way, speaking to the youngest in the talent pool and increasing the brand recognition of the industry's biggest managers.
    

        It's another example of the institutionalization of the hedge fund industry, which has grown to the point where the biggest managers are recruiting straight from undergraduate programs instead of poaching talent from investment banks or private equity. Point72, Citadel, D. E. Shaw, and others have built competitive, well-paid internship programs. Millennium and UBS have a partnership in which a new grad for the hedge fund spends a year in the bank's equity research department.
    

        Internal training programs are still a work in progress for many funds, and talented young people can get washed out quickly, Caughran said.
    

        ""Historically, a lot of funds expected young talent to learn through osmosis,"" he said. He added that he struggled when he first got to the buy side, though he started his investing career at the Tiger Cub hedge fund Maverick Capital, not a multistrategy fund. Fundamental Edge has had 750 students take its various training courses and has other full-time instructors with buy-side experience.
    

        He also lays out what life is like at these firms, which are often more fast-paced than the managers or banks his students are typically working at.
    

        ""If you're making the career choice to go to one of these places, you should go in eyes wide open about what the trade-offs and benefits are,"" he said.
    

        Firms in general have also become more transparent, in part to attract more people to their managers and improve their brand recognition. Cohen has spoken about investing and career growth on a company-run podcast. Griffin recently met with Cambridge University students and offered advice on what they should do after graduation.
    

        The advent of Substacks like Greenberg's and podcasts like Garber's only increases awareness of these firms and what they're like from an insider's perspective.
    

        ""These are the conversations I am having with my former colleagues from when I worked at Citadel, at Millennium,"" Garber said.

GameStop’s stock closed up 9.6% at $27.15 after trading as high as 10.2% on Monday, marking its highest closing price this month.
The share surge follows a photo posted by Cohen on Friday, showing him standing alongside Saylor, a Bitcoin investor and the co-founder of MicroStrategy—the largest corporate Bitcoin owner.
GameStop has forayed into cryptocurrency in the past and established a now-defunct cryptocurrency wallet in 2022 that sent shares rocketing in the days following its launch.
Monday’s jump in shares helped GameStop’s stock recover from a February slump, though the video game retailer’s stock is still down over 16% in the past month.
GameStop and MicroStrategy did not immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment.

MicroStrategy’s stock closed up a little over 2% on Monday at $334.62. The business intelligence company’s shares are up 15% since the start of the year.
We estimate Saylor’s net worth at $8.5 billion following a $111 million increase Monday. Saylor owned at least 17,732 Bitcoin valued at about $1 billion as of August.
GameStop shares are down 13% on the year after surging 85% in a volatile year of trading in 2024. The video game retailer’s stock has been a large player in the meme stock market over the last few years and jumped as high as $48.75 last year when Keith Gill, an investor who led Gamestop’s unprecedented surge in 2021, returned to the internet after going quiet for years.

84,2025-02-10,"Sometimes, in the tech world, visionaries miss the mark. These top 10 tech fails are lessons in what not to do when pivoting and rebranding."
85,2025-02-10,"President Donald Trump signed an order Monday imposing global tariffs of 25% on all steel and aluminum imports in a move that will likely please domestic steelmakers but hurt allies like Canada and Mexico.
President Donald Trump speaks to reporters next to Air Force One after arriving back at Joint Base ... [+] Andrews, Md., on Feb. 2.
Feb. 10Trump signed an order placing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from all countries, building on a policy from his first term that implemented similar tariffs—allies that received waivers from former President Joe Biden will be included in the tariffs, with Trump saying it was “a big deal, the beginning of making America rich again,” multiple outlets reported.
Feb. 10, 6:00 a.m. ESTShares of steelmaker U.S. Steel and aluminum producer Alcoa surged in pre-market trading early Monday after Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports.
U.S. Steel’s share price hit $40 in pre-market trading, up nearly 8.2% from Friday, while Alcoa’s shares rose 4.65% to $37.80.
Major stock futures indexes also rose early on Monday with the Nasdaq 100 Futures going up nearly 0.65% to 21,729 while S&P 500 Futures climbed up 0.4% to 6,074.
Feb. 9, 7 a.m. ESTThe European Commission, the executive arm of the EU, issued a statement criticizing the tariffs, saying: “The EU sees no justification for the imposition of tariffs on its exports. We will react to protect the interests of European businesses, workers and consumers from unjustified measures.”
The bloc’s officials warned that tariffs would disrupt “deeply integrated” transatlantic production chains and added, “By imposing tariffs, the US would be taxing its own citizens, raising costs for business, and fuelling inflation.”
Feb 9, 5:30 a.m. ESTAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told his country’s parliament that he has booked an urgent call with Trump to seek a special exemption from the 25% tariffs.
The Sydney Morning Herald reported that Albanese will cite close U.S.-Australian strategic ties and the tariff’s potential harm to U.S. workers as a means to dissuade Trump from imposing them on Australia. The country’s Trade Minister Don Farrell also highlighted this exact argument in a statement on Monday, saying “Australian steel and aluminum is creating thousands of good paying American jobs, and are key for our shared defence interests.”
According to Australian public broadcaster ABC News, the country exported 223,000 tonnes of steel to the US, and 83,000 tonnes of aluminum last year.
Feb. 8, 4:30 p.m. ESTTrump told reporters on Air Force One he intends to announce a sweeping 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports Monday, multiple outlets report, and will announce “reciprocal tariffs” Tuesday that are equal to those other countries levy on U.S. goods—though it’s still unclear when any of those tariffs will take effect.
Feb. 8, 3:30 p.m. ESTIn a pre-Super Bowl interview with Fox host Bret Baier, Trump claimed Canada and Mexico had not done enough yet to avoid the U.S. imposing tariffs on their imports, saying, “Something needs to happen and [the current situation is] not sustainable.”
Feb. 7, 2 p.m. ESTTrump reversed his decision to eliminate the “de minimis” loophole that allowed packages from China valued at under $800 to be processed without customs duties or tariffs—a boon for retailers like Shein and Temu—though the order said Trump will get rid of the loophole again once the U.S. commerce secretary establishes a system to “fully and expediently process and collect tariff revenue.”
Feb. 7, 1 p.m. ESTTrump said he will announce reciprocal tariffs next week that would allow the U.S. to impose tariffs equal to those other countries impose on U.S. goods, fulfilling a campaign promise, though he did not say which countries he would target.
Feb. 5, 8:15 a.m. ESTThe United State Postal Service said it will “continue accepting all international inbound mail and packages from China and Hong Kong Posts,” reversing its decision to suspend inbound packages from China and Hong Kong on Tuesday night.
The postal service noted that it is working closely with U.S. Customs and Border Patrol to “implement an efficient collection mechanism for the new China tariffs to ensure the least disruption to package delivery.”
Feb. 5, 5:30 a.m. ESTDuring the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s daily press briefing on Wednesday, spokesperson Lin Jian commented on the USPS decision by accusing the U.S. government of “politicizing and suppressing Chinese companies,” and added that China is prepared to take necessary steps to defend its “legitimate rights and interests.”
Lin, however, refused to elaborate on specific steps that Beijing plans to take in response.
Feb. 5, 12:30 a.m. ESTOn Tuesday night, the US Postal Service announced that it will temporarily suspend inbound packages shipped by China and Hong Kong Posts.
The move comes as the Trump’s tariffs also closed the “de minimis” exemption that allowed packages valued under $800 to be processed without paying any customs duties or tariffs.
Although the USPS did not specify a reason for the move, it was likely put in place to allow the postal service to come up with a procedure to process and charge duties on the “de minimis” packages shipped by mail.
Feb. 4, 3:30 p.m. ESTForbes reported Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on Mexico—even though they’re delayed one month—has put a pause on a planned investment by his son-in-law Jared Kushner’s private equity firm, Affinity Partners, into one of Mexico’s leading infrastructure companies, though Affinity has not released details on the deal it was pursuing.
Feb. 4, 7:30 a.m. ESTU.S. Stock Futures remained flat on Tuesday morning, with the Nasdaq up 0.1% to 21,430 in premarket trading, while S&P 500 Futures were up only 0.01% to 6,022.
Feb. 4, 7:15 a.m. ESTEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen addressed the looming threat of Trump placing tariffs on the EU in a speech to the bloc’s ambassadors, saying: “A lot is at stake for both sides. There are jobs, businesses, industries here and in the US that rely on the transatlantic partnership. We want to make it work...And we will always protect our own interests.” She added the EU is ready for “tough negotiations where needed,” and is prepared to “work out any grievances.”
Feb. 4, 5:15 a.m. ESTChina also announced the launch of a formal anti-trust investigation into Google over “suspected violation of China's Anti-Monopoly Law,” in addition to the retaliatory duties.
The scope and nature of the Google anti-trust probe is unclear: the company has very limited presence in the country as the company’s search engine and other key services have not been accessible in mainland China for more than a decade.
PVH Group—the parent company of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein—and biotech firm Illumina were two other U.S. companies targeted by Beijing on Tuesday, with both being added to the country’s “unreliable entity list.”
In premarket trading early on Tuesday, PVH’s shares were down 4% to $80—after a 7% slide on Monday—and Illumina was down 5% to $124.40.
Feb. 4, 5:00 a.m. ESTThe Chinese Embassy in the U.S. issued a statement regarding Beijing’s retaliatory actions, saying they were “necessary countermeasures” that were “completely justified and reasonable,” and added China has also filed a “lawsuit with the WTO” on the matter.
The statement added: “The U.S. needs to view and solve its own fentanyl issue in an objective and rational way, cherish China's goodwill, instead of threatening other countries with arbitrary tariff hikes.”
Feb. 4, 2:00 a.m. ESTA spokesperson from China’s Ministry of Commerce told reporters in Beijing that the U.S.’s actions were putting “unilateralism above multilateralism,” and China was willing to work with other members of the World Trade Organization to jointly respond.
Feb. 4, 2:00 a.m. ESTIn addition to retaliatory tariffs China also announced export controls on rare earth minerals and other elements that are critical for the production of semiconductors and other high-tech components—including tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, molybdenum, indium.
Feb. 4, 1:00 a.m. ESTTrump’s sweeping 10% tariffs on imports from China went into effect at midnight on Tuesday, prompting Beijing to retaliate with a plan to impose additional tariffs on certain U.S. imports starting next week, according to state-run media reports.
Starting February 10, China will impose an additional 15% tariff on coal and natural gas imported from the U.S. along with an additional 10% tariffs on crude oil, agricultural machinery, large cars, and pickup trucks, according to a Chinese Ministry of Finance notice.
The ministry’s notice said the U.S.’s “unilateral imposition of tariffs seriously violates the World Trade Organization’s rules” and added that it would not only be “unhelpful in solving its own problems, but also undermine the normal economic and trade cooperation between China and the US.”
Feb. 3, 1:57 p.m. ESTTrump announced the tariffs against Canada will be paused for 30 days, saying the longtime U.S. ally will implement a $1.3 billion border reinforcement plan that will bolster the U.S.-Canada border with “new choppers, technology and personnel... and increased resources to stop the flow of fentanyl” (the border plan was announced by Canada in December, before Trump took office).
Feb. 3, 1:57 p.m. ESTCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the border reinforcement plan and tariff pause in a tweet, noting the launch of a “Canada- U.S. Joint Strike Force to combat organized crime, fentanyl and money laundering,” the second of which Trump has used as a justification for sweeping tariffs (government reports contradict Trump’s claims that the flow of fentanyl coming to the U.S. through Canada is “massive,” according to The New York Times).
Feb. 3, 3:00 p.m. ESTChina’s ambassador to the United Nations Fu Cong said China will file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization against Trump’s tariffs, The New York Times reports, adding the country believes the move violates WTO policies and China “may be forced to take countermeasures” against Trump’s taxes on its imports.
Feb. 3, 1 p.m. ESTTrump told reporters in the Oval Office his 10% tariffs against China are an “opening salvo” and could still go up further and reiterated that the tariffs against Canada and China will still take effect Tuesday though Mexico’s taxes are paused, also saying the U.S. isn’t “treated well” by Canada and he “[doesn’t] know” what the northern country could do to keep the tariffs from taking effect.
Feb. 3, 10:41 a.m. ESTTrump said on Truth Social he had a “very friendly conversation” with Sheinbaum in which she “immediately” agreed to send 10,000 Mexican soldiers to the border, and confirmed they will pause the tariffs on the country’s imports for one month while his administration negotiates with Mexican officials.
Feb. 3, 10:21 a.m. ESTSheinbaum said the U.S. is pausing tariffs for a month in an announcement on X, also saying the country’s National Guard will station 10,000 members on the U.S.-Mexico border to protect against drug trafficking.
Feb. 3, 10 a.m. ESTU.S. stocks slumped Monday morning as the market responded to Trump’s tariffs, with alcoholic beverage companies, cryptocurrency-focused companies, automakers and multinational tech companies like Apple and Nvidia taking the biggest hits.
Feb. 3, 9:09 a.m. ESTTrump said on Truth Social he spoke with Trudeau and will speak with him again this afternoon—and continued to slam the country, claiming it’s responsible for a “DRUG WAR” and saying about Canadian leaders declining to do business with the U.S. because of tariffs, “What’s that all about?”
Feb. 3, 8 a.m. ESTOntario Premier Doug Ford said the province, which includes Toronto, will ban all U.S. companies from receiving government contracts with the province, saying those companies “only have President Trump to blame”—and canceled the province’s contract with Elon Musk-led satellite internet company Starlink, writing, “Ontario won’t do business with people hellbent on destroying our economy.”
Feb. 3, 6:50 a.m. ESTWith a threat of tariffs on European imports to the U.S. looming, markets in the continent were also hit with by a selloff with the Euro STOXX 50 Index sliding 1.6% while the London Stock Exchange’s FTSE 100 Index fell 1.2%
Feb. 3, 6:30 a.m ESTThe U.S. Dollar Index—which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of six other major currencies—rose to a two-year high of 109.45 on Monday morning, up nearly 1%.
Feb. 3, 6:15 a.m. ESTThe cryptocurrency market also appears to have been rattled by the fears of a trade war with Bitcoin’s price dropping more than 3.6% in the past 24 hours to $95,509.
Ether, which is the world’s second most valuable crypto token by market cap, was hit even harder as it price has crashed more than 15% in the previous 24 hours to around $2610.
The president’s own meme crypto token $TRUMP (Official Trump) also took a hit, as its price slid more than 13.5% in the previous 24 hours to $17.80. Unlike other major crypto tokens, however, $TRUMP has been on a downward slide since its explosive launch and had shed more than 30% of its value just in the last week.
Feb. 3, 6 a.m. ESTThe U.S. stock futures slumped early on Monday as global markets braced for the fallout of President Donald Trump’s decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China.
As of early Monday morning Dow Futures was down to 44,113, falling 1.3%, while the tech centric NASDAQ Futures saw an even sharper slump of 1.6% to 21,227. S&P 500 Futures were also hit by the selloff, dropping 1.4% to 5,980.
Feb 3, 5 a.m. ESTMajor Asian stock indices were also hit by a selloff amid trade war concerns with Japan’s Nikkei 225 index falling 2.66%, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 dropping 1.79%, South Korea’s KOSPI index down 2.52% and India’s BSE Sensex down 0.41%.
In China, the Shanghai Stock Exchange’s Composite Index closed relatively flat, only 0.06% in the red, while the Shenzhen-based SZSE Component Index—which focusses on tech companies and small cap private enterprises—took a bigger hit and dropped 1.33%.
Feb. 2, 2:53 p.m. ESTMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum issued a video message on X announcing the country will come out with more details Monday morning on its countermeasures against the U.S. tariffs, saying the country will “act with a cool head and love for the people” and arguing Trump’s claims the Mexican government is allied with criminal drug groups is “terribly irresponsible,” according to translations by Bloomberg and The New York Times.
Feb. 2, 2 p.m. ESTTrump’s border czar Tom Homan told the Times in an interview that Canada has “taken steps” to address Trump’s concerns about immigration and drug trafficking, “but they haven’t taken enough steps,” adding that while Canada is “improving” its border security, Trump “doesn’t feel like they’ve done enough, and that’ll be his call.”
Feb. 2, 1 p.m. ESTThe Canadian government unveiled the full list of U.S. imports that the country will levy 25% tariffs on as part of its retaliatory measures against the U.S., which will apply to $30 billion worth of goods to start out with, including numerous food items, plastics, rubber, luggage, lumber, clothing, business supplies, glassware, appliances, furniture, cosmetics and more.
Feb. 2, 10:30 a.m. ESTHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem acknowledged on “Meet the Press” that Trump’s tariffs could raise prices but said the blame would fall on other countries for not following Trump’s demands, rather than the president, encouraging other countries to “get on board and to make sure that they’re not pushing up prices” and claiming “if prices go up, it’s because of other people’s reactions to America’s laws.”
Feb. 2, 9 a.m. ESTCanadian Ambassador Kristen Hillman told ABC News Canadians are “perplexed” and “confused” by Trump’s tariffs on the nation’s imports and argued it’s “hard to know what more we can do” to prevent the tariffs since the Canadian government has already been “leaning in hard” to appease Trump—but noted Canada does not intend to back down from its plan for retaliatory tariffs, as Canadians “are going to expect that our government stands firm and stands up for itself.”
Feb. 2, 8:30 a.m. ESTDoug Ford, the premier of Canada’s Ontario province, said on X the region’s sole liquor wholesaler will remove American alcohol from its catalogs so that stores and restaurants in Ontario cannot stock any U.S. liquors—it follows similar moves from Nova Scotia Premier Tim Houston and British Columbia Premier David Eby, who banned his province’s Liquor Distribution Branch from buying American alcohol from “red states.”
Feb. 2, 8:09 a.m. ESTThe president defended his decision, writing on Truth Social, “WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!). BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID.”
Feb. 1Canada and Mexico both levied retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports in response to Trump’s directive, while China said it would file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization and take “countermeasures” in response to the move.
Feb. 1Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported goods from Canada and Mexico—other than energy from Canada, which will be taxed at 10%—and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, which he claimed was to hold the countries “accountable to their promises of halting illegal immigration and stopping poisonous fentanyl and other drugs from flowing into our country.”
“MAKE YOUR PRODUCT IN THE USA AND THERE ARE NO TARIFFS!” Trump said on Truth Social in defense of his tariffs. “WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT IS NOW BEING RUN WITH COMMON SENSE — AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SPECTACULAR!!!”
Trump’s tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China would effectively could cost each U.S. household more than $830 in additional taxes in 2025, according to an analysis released by the center-right Tax Foundation. The organization also predicted Trump’s plan would reduce the U.S.’ economic output by 0.4% and increase taxes in the U.S. overall by $1.2 trillion between 2025 and 2034. Economists have long warned Trump’s tariff plan would raise prices for American consumers—as the import taxes are paid by the U.S. companies that import foreign goods, which then pass on those costs to the consumer by raising prices—and a May analysis by the nonpartisan think tank Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) concluded Trump imposing broad tariffs on imported goods would “[inflict] significant collateral damage on the US economy.” Goldman Sachs economists led by Ronnie Walker previously projected in April that prices on consumer goods would go up by 0.1% for every percentage increase in the effective tariff rate and raise inflation. In addition to imported goods, economists have predicted the price of domestic goods will also go up, as U.S. companies will “opportunistically” raise prices to take advantage of having less competition from imported products.
Trump has suggested he wants to impose universal tariffs on other countries’ goods, though it’s still unclear when that could happen or what any broader tariffs could look like. “I have it in my mind what it’s going to be but I won’t be setting it yet, but it’ll be enough to protect our country,” Trump said about his plan to impose tariffs on all imported goods. The president told reporters Feb. 1 he plans on “doing something substantial” in terms of taxing European imports specifically, saying, “Am I going to impose tariffs on the European Union? Do you want the truthful answer or should I give you a political answer? Absolutely, absolutely.”
Business and manufacturing groups have criticized Trump’s tariffs, with U.S. Chamber of Commerce vice president John Murphy saying the move “is unprecedented, won’t solve these problems, and will only raise prices for American families and upend supply chains.” National Association of Manufacturers CEO Jay Timmons said the “ripple effects” of the tariffs “will be severe,” particularly for smaller manufacturers, warning, “Ultimately, manufacturers will bear the brunt of these tariffs, undermining our ability to sell our products at a competitive price and putting American jobs at risk.” Leaders of major companies have previously suggested Trump’s tariffs will lead to higher prices for American consumers, with Walmart chief financial officer John David Rainey telling CNBC in November the import taxes mean “there probably will be cases where prices will go up for consumers.” Best Buy CEO Corie Barry acknowledged on the company’s earnings call in November that most of its goods are imported from China and Mexico and any tariffs would likely result in higher prices, saying, “These are goods that people need, and higher prices are not helpful.”
In China, the state-run tabloid Global Times, criticized the move in an editorial, saying “trade coercion” will not fix the U.S.’s “fentanyl crisis.” The op-ed notes that the Trump administration’s actions “violates WTO rules and disciplines” and result in countermeasures that “could lead to a global trade war.” The Chinese foreign ministry also expressed opposition to the move and said it would take “necessary countermeasures to defend its legitimate rights and interests.” The ministry said the tariffs cannot “solve the U.S.' problems at home” and will not benefit either side.
The Toronto Star published a guide for people who want to buy Canadian during the trade war, which included a list of grocery and other essential products sold by Canadian companies. The newspaper’s editorial titled: “We didn’t want this trade war. But now we must fight,” urged Canadians to “band together despite our differences” and grasp that “no one has ever won by appeasing a bully.” The Globe and Mail’s editorial page said that the trade war would reshape North America and warned, “There will be no way to satisfy all his demands. He will keep using them in a predatory manner...There will be no way to satisfy all his demands. He will keep using them in a predatory manner.” The Toronto Sun’s editorial acknowledged Canada will not be able to win an “all-out trade war” with the U.S. but added: “Still, when the bully hits you, you hit back.” The editorial called for retaliation targeting products that “Americans will notice” but “will have the least impact on Canadian consumers.”
Trump has used the flow of fentanyl as one of his primary justifications for tariffs against Canada and Mexico, despite the U.S.’ northern ally not playing a large role in fentanyl smuggling when compared to Mexico. Trudeau has said fentanyl smuggling from Canada contributes to a fraction of a percent of the illegal fentanyl in the U.S., while U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration data has found only about 43 pounds of fentanyl was seized at the northern border in 2024. That same year, about 21,100 pounds of fentanyl were seized at the southern border.
Trump has long vowed to impose tariffs on imported goods, even as economists and business leaders have decried the move. The president previously levied higher tariffs on Chinese imports during his first term, which sparked a trade war with China before the two sides reached a trade agreement in December 2019. While Trump long promised on the campaign trail to levy tariffs on imported goods, he only proposed 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods in November, which marked an escalation over the 10% to 20% he proposed pre-election. The president said on his first day in office that he planned to impose the tariffs Feb. 1.
In Truth Social posts last week, Trump also reiterated his desire for Canada to become the “51st state,” claiming the country wouldn’t be “viable” if it weren’t for U.S. subsidies. Trump doubled down on his comments to Baier on Sunday, saying he’s serious about wanting to annex Canada after Trudeau warned business leaders Friday that the president’s threats regarding the country are a “real thing.” Canadian officials have strongly decried any suggestion the country should become part of the U.S., with Immigration Minister Marc Miller saying the suggestion is “beneath a president of the United States” and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs Dominic LeBlanc saying the comments are “a way for [Trump], I think, to sow confusion, to agitate people, to create chaos knowing this will never happen.”

87,2025-02-10,"Apple Silicon chips have transformed attitudes toward ARM architecture, from being suitable mostly for power-efficient mobile devices to also capable of powering desktop processors which Intel behind.
ARM CEO Rene Haas has now weighed-in on the DeepSeek controversy in a new interview, expressing his skepticism about one of of the key claims and voicing his expectation that China’s AI chatbot will be banned in the US …
DeepSeek caused shockwaves in AI circles when the company posted benchmarks indicating that its performance was comparable to the world’s best existing models. Experts quickly verified the claims, with concerns raised that China was seemingly able to achieve this at a fraction of the development cost of US models.
That created the possibility that US AI companies could be significantly over-valued, and soon face a lot more competition. It was this fear which saw the stock prices of tech giants fall – with Apple a notable exception.
Key to concerns was China’s claim to have developed its model with a fraction of the computing power of US models like ChatGPT, claiming that software optimisation compensated for much cheaper hardware.
But Hass told the Financial Times that he doubts this claim.
He says he does not believe “the rumours” that “they did this on a shoestring budget . . . I think that’s where people just over-indexed on ‘maybe the world’s coming to an end’.”
He argued that if it were true, we’d have seen US AI companies announce that they were cutting their capital expenditure plans to take advantage of this more efficient approach. So far at least, that hasn’t happened.
Haas also thinks DeepSeek will be banned in the US, while emphasizing that he doesn’t have any inside knowledge on this, but is simply drawing what he believes to be a logical conclusion.
He does not predict a rosy future for DeepSeek, saying he thinks it will “get shut down”. Washington is “scrambling on what to do with this thing. Think about it . . . if you’re not going to allow a TikTok, why would you allow this?”
We’ve already seen privacy and national security concerns raised, with multiple security flaws found in the iOS app.
Haas went on to say that the company plans in future to sell its own chips, rather than just selling licenses to use the architecture, and that he believes AI holds the potential to revolutionize medical research. 
He mentions using AI on DNA and RNA research […] There is, he says, an “opportunity to cure cancer in our lifetime. It’s pretty real.”

88,2025-02-10,"A tit-for-tat trade war between the US and its neighbors could spell real trouble for S&P 500 earnings.
If US tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China spark retaliation, the benchmark index could suffer a serious hit to earnings per share, Bank of America estimated this week.
""We estimate that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico plus 10% incremental tariffs on China translates into a 2% hit to EPS, all else equal (1.7% from Canada & Mexico and 0.3% from China),"" analysts at the bank wrote. ""However, if it escalates into bilateral tariffs, we estimate an 8% hit to EPS assuming unitary elasticity.""
Given Washington's rising protectionism, this risk isn't far-fetched. Just weeks into his presidency, Donald Trump has announced tariffs on US North American trading partners and has levied an additional 10% duty on Chinese products. Though tariffs on Mexico and Canada have been delayed, the initial announcements sparked promises of retaliation from both countries.
A trade war could derail market returns for the S&P 500, considering that earnings are a key engine of growth for stocks, though few other banks on Wall Street have projected EPS fallout to be as deep as what BofA is implying.
In a recent note, Goldman Sachs estimated Trump's protectionism could slash EPS by 2%-3%, as a five percentage point increase in the tariff rate typically lowers S&P earnings by 1%-2%.
This, in turn, would drag the stock market down 5%. 
Meanwhile, in December, Barclays outlined that a full-blown trade war between the US and its continental trading partners would amount to a 2.8% decline in EPS. Double-digit earnings fallout could loom over the discretionary and materials sectors, given each group's production presence in Mexico and Canada.
Putting aside the threat of a trade war with these two countries, BofA outlined that tariffs could initially play a positive role, by igniting a re-stocking cycle.
Companies also appear more prepared for trade tensions since 2018, given that Trump's first-term tariffs have not been erased. Meanwhile, American exposure to China has been reduced by over a third.
Ahead of any tariff disruptions, US earnings are coming in strong, and fourth-quarter results are up 12% year-over-year. Wall Street sentiment peaking, and mentions of industry ""bottoms"" are soaring — a signal that cyclically depressed sectors are verging on an earnings recovery.
""Our Corporate Sentiment Score soared to the highest level in its history (since 2004). This indicator has led S&P EPS YoY (69% correlation with a quarter lead), suggesting a continued upcycle in earnings,"" analysts wrote.

89,2025-02-10,"After experiencing significant fluctuations, the crypto market is currently in a stable zone, with all major cryptocurrencies showing positive gains. The leading cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is hovering around $98,000 and trending upwards. It will be interesting to see how the cryptocurrencies respond to the inflation data that is set to be released this week as the crypto market continues to gain mainstream attention each day.
Let’s see which cryptocurrencies are worth watching this week.
2 / 7
Shiba Inu, Dogecoin’s main rival and another popular memecoin, has recently seen a significant surge. The primary driver behind this rally is the burn rate, which spiked by a surprising 807% in a 24-hour span, according to data from Shibburn. In total, the Shiba Inu ecosystem has removed 20,530,875 SHIB tokens from circulation over the past 24 hours.
For those unfamiliar, coin burning is the process of permanently removing cryptocurrency tokens from circulation by sending them to an inaccessible wallet address. The goal is to reduce the supply of tokens, which, in turn, can increase the value of the remaining coins.
Currently, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading at $0.00001603, reflecting an 11% increase over the past week.
3 / 7
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has acknowledged Canary Capital’s application for a spot Litecoin (LTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) within two weeks of its initial filing. This news has led to a significant price surge fueled by speculation about increasing institutional interest. Due to Litecoin’s functional similarities to Bitcoin, some analysts believe that the SEC may be more inclined to approve the ETF soon.
Currently, Litecoin (LTC) is trading at $118, reflecting a nearly 24% growth over the past week.
4 / 7
Ondo Finance, a leader in blockchain-based financial innovation, has introduced Ondo Chain, a new blockchain designed to connect traditional finance with the blockchain ecosystem. Ondo Chain acts as a bridge between conventional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi), allowing for the tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs), including U.S. public securities.
The news has triggered the price of the token Ondo (ONDO), which is currently at $1.36, representing an almost 17% increase over the last week. 
5 / 7
Circle, the issuer of the stablecoin USDC, has officially launched its dollar-pegged stablecoin on the Aptos blockchain network. Coinbase (COIN), the largest crypto exchange, has already included Aptos-native USDC in its listing roadmap. The news has pushed the price of Aptos native token, APT, up and is currently trading at $6.30, seeing a 9% surge over the past week.
6 / 7
Bittensor seeks to decentralize machine learning and artificial intelligence by creating a marketplace where AI functions as a tradable commodity. While some industry experts remain skeptical, labeling Bittensor as a “memecoin” capitalizing on the current AI hype, its recent performance suggests growing interest.
In the past few days, Bittensor’s value has surged, likely due to the ongoing competition between China’s Deepseek and OpenAI, which may have driven Bittensor’s strong performance.
Currently, Litecoin (LTC) is trading at $396, reflecting a nearly 26% growth over the past week.

90,2025-02-10,"""I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue.""
Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has discussed the growing importance of the PC market, though stopped short of outright confirming GTA 6 will be heading to PC.
GTA 6 is currently slated for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, but there's been no mention of a PC release so far. That's surprising in 2025, when big releases are often released simultaneously across all three platforms, or at least follow up soon with PC.
Speaking to IGN, Zelnick teased a PC release of GTA 6 will be on the way, but the company tends not to ""go across all platforms simultaneously"".
""So with Civ 7 it's available on console and PC and Switch right away,"" Zelnick said, making comparison with Firaxis' recently launched Civilization 7. ""With regard to others in our lineup, we don't always go across all platforms simultaneously. Historically, Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms.""
Interestingly, Zelnick admitted that the PC version of a multiplatform game can generate 40 percent of overall sales. As a result, the PC platform is growing in importance.
""We have seen PC become a much more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue,"" he said.
Still, the focus for GTA 6 for now are the console releases, which Zelnick expects to boost console sales in response.
""When you have a big title in the market and we have many of them coming, historically that has sold consoles,"" Zelnick said.
""And I think that will happen this year. I don't think tariffs are going to be our friend, but I think there will be a meaningful uptick in console sales in calendar '25 because of the release schedule, not just coming from us, but coming from others. So I'm not concerned about that [console sales falling]. I think the trend that you'd want to focus on is this increasing share of the market that is reflected in PC.""
So why no PC release for GTA 6 at present? As Zelnick noted, Rockstar has traditionally started with console releases in the past: GTA 5, for instance, released in September 2013 while the PC version (initially aiming for simultaneous release) was delayed until April 2015.
Rockstar also has a torrid history with modders, including the infamous Hot Coffee mod.
Just last month, the company shut down an ambitious mod that put a playable version of GTA 4's Liberty City inside GTA 5.

91,2025-02-10,"Anyone with a commercial fleet will soon be able to buy Rivian’s electric vans, the automaker said Monday.
Rivian (RIVN+4.37%) had been in an exclusive van sales partnership with Amazon (AMZN+2.02%), which promised to buy 100,000 of the plug-in vehicles. That partnership ended in late 2023, and Rivian said it is now ready to sell its vans to other commercial businesses.
“Rivian has been trialing its commercial van with several large fleets in the U.S., and preparing its fleet management process for the mass market,” the company said, according to Reuters. “These pilots have paved the way to enable Rivian to open sales further.”
The automaker known for its electric trucks sold 20,000 vans so far to Amazon and plans to deliver 80,000 more by 2030. It is also partnering with AT&T (T+1.32%), although its unclear how many vans the wireless carrier bought.
“Over the last year we have been focusing our efforts on testing with some larger fleets, and we’re really pleased with how those trials have gone,” Tom Solomon, senior director of business development at Rivian, said, according to The Verge. “As a result, we’re excited to now be able to open sales to fleets of all sizes in the US, whether they want one van or thousands.”
Rivian has two van models, the RCV 500 and the RCV 700, which respectively sell for $79,900 and $83,900.
Last year, it had to pause making the vans because of a parts shortage, which has since been resolved.
Van sales can hopefully help Rivian on its path to financial stability, in part because the vehicles have higher profit margins than its pickup trucks.
After a tough second quarter, Rivian stock soared in January after it  managed to surpass analysts’ expectations for fourth-quarter deliveries and dismiss production constraints.
The electric truck and SUV company said it delivered 14,183 vehicles between October and December, beating estimates of about 13,500 sales. That brought the company’s full-year deliveries to 51,579, greater than the 50,122 vehicles delivered a year earlier and squarely within Rivian’s forecast.

92,2025-02-10,"Shares of video game companies are soaring past the broader stock market in 2025 as investors anticipate some high-profile software and hardware releases in the year. 
The Global X Video Games & Esports ETF has surged 12% year-to-date, quadrupling the S&P 500's 3% return over the same period.
US-listed shares of Japan-based Nintendo have led the charge, surging 23% year-to-date. The gain has mainly been driven by the recent unveiling of its next-generation console, the Nintendo Switch 2, which is expected to be released in time for the holiday season.
With Nintendo's current console approaching its eighth birthday in March, pent-up demand from consumers is expected to be so high that Nintendo has said it probably won't be able to keep up.
Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said the company is ""taking risks and proceeding with production so that we can meet as much demand as possible,"" according to a translation of the company's earnings call last week.
Analysts at JPMorgan said the expected backward compatibility of the Nintendo Switch 2 should enable Nintendo to sell vastly more software titles than it was able to do with the original Switch console.
JPMorgan estimates Nintendo will sell 190 million software units in the company's fiscal year 2025, with that figure ballooning to 272 million by its fiscal year 2029.
""We expect software sales volume to grow with help from 1) the introduction of partial forward compatibility for select titles and 2) backward compatibility,"" JPMorgan said in a report last month.
For Take-Two Interactive, the software developer's 16% rally to record highs this year was reinforced by the company confirming last week that it remains on track to release its highly-anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 later this Fall.
Analyst expectations are high considering that its predecessor, Grand Theft Auto 5, is the third best-selling video game of all time, with 210 million copies, behind Minecraft's 300 million units and 520 million copies of Tetris, according to data from Gamespot.
Like the Nintendo Switch, the last Grand Theft Auto game was released about 12 years ago, and pent-up demand for the title is high. Analysts at Ned Davis Research said they believe the game could sell 250 million units over its lifetime.
Another video game stock that has surged this year is China-based software developer NetEase, which developed the popular Marvel Rivals game. The game allows users to play more than 30 different Marvel characters in a team-based combat.
For NDR analysts, the upside move in the video game sector has been unsurprising. The research firm recommended investors buy video game stocks late last year, in part due to the anticipation of strong demand for the Nintendo Switch 2 and the ""800-pound gorilla"" that is Grand Theft Auto 6.
""New titles for 2025 — especially Grand Theft Auto VI — and the release of the Nintendo Switch 2 should ensure that a sales growth bottom is in for the industry,"" NDR said in December.
Video game outperformance is also stark relative to other forms of media. 
While video game companies are starting to see their fortunes turn after a slowdown in the industry, companies in the film industry are still struggling.
Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery, Disney, and Paramount Global have languished this year. Warner Bros. Discover and Disney shares are down 5% and 2%, respectively, while Paramount stock is up just over 1%.

93,2025-02-10,"Business Insider Edition 
My son recently became old enough to get his learner's permit. In the state of Ohio, that's 15 years and six months of age. But he's not remotely interested in pursuing getting his driver's license. 

        After considerable research and thought, I support his decision.
    

I'm Gen X, and when I was in high school, most teenagers couldn't wait to get their driver's licenses and the potential for independence that came with them. 
    

        While my family couldn't afford to get me a car, the potential to visit friends' houses or just drive around by myself using my mom's car was a huge motivator. I craved independence as a teenager, and wanted to get away from my mom and the house whenever I could. I got my permit as soon as I could and learned how to drive through inexpensive classes (about $50) through a local driving school. I passed my test on the first try.
    

        I knew my son wasn't super hot to learn to drive. Like many of his Gen Z peers, he doesn't have much of an external social life outside school and participation in marching band, which occupies the latter half of each year. Outside school, he connects with friends through online games or video calls.
    

I thought he might be driving to work by this age, at least to a summer job. I had to get a job to contribute to household expenses as soon as I was old enough to work, and worked after school and on weekends the last two years of high school. 
    

        But between marching band, which starts in early August, and my shared custody schedule with his dad, who lives in another city, my son being consistently available for any kind of summer job has been impossible as he only has a few weeks free each summer.
    

        After considerable research, I support his decision not to get a license. There are so many reasons we have both decided it's best for him to wait — one of those rare occasions where my teen and I are on the same page.
    

        First, Ohio law requires that anyone under 18 who wants a driver's license attend an accredited driving school for several weeks. Few of these schools exist, which allows them to monopolize the market and make the classes very expensive (around $700). Right now, that's a big financial reach for me. He must also have 50 hours of driving experience in addition to the classes, which would all be my responsibility. 
    

        He has said he prefers I teach him when he's ready to learn, but like most teenagers and parents, our communications can be fraught with disagreements and push-back. Getting him to listen to me during driving lessons at this age would be challenging.
    

        Secondly, in Ohio, if you wait until you are 18 to get your license, you can skip the class and have a friend or parent teach you to drive. But if you fail the test the first time you take it, you must take the expensive classes anyway. 
    

        The third factor is safety. Some people might argue that it's safer for younger drivers to wait to get their licenses, and the statistics are hard to ignore. According to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, though they drive fewer miles than older people, drivers ages 16 to 19 are four times more likely to crash than drivers over 20, and these crashes are the leading cause of death for people in this age bracket. Risk is highest at the age of 16, which is just about how old my son is now. To be completely honest, this scares me a lot. I could only have one child, and parenting him has been the best thing I've done. The thought of losing him in a crash is terrifying.
    

        Finally, there's the insurance factor. Most people know generally that it's quite expensive to add a teenager to their auto insurance policy, but teen boys cost more to insure than teen girls. That's because statistically, boys are more likely to be involved in accidents. They're also more likely to engage in risky behavior behind the wheel, including driving after drinking alcohol. I called my insurance provider to inquire about a quote and was told that adding my kid to the policy as a driver would double my rates.
    

        After researching all of this, I began to reconsider whether my kid being on the road is good for anyone — him, other drivers, or me, considering the worry and stress I would have every time he gets behind the wheel.
    

        Maybe Gen Z is smarter than I was at their age. Not long after I got my license, I took Mom's car to a friend's house to make signs for a football game the next night. My family lived in poverty, and my mom's Honda Civic was not well-maintained, including bald tires and a propensity to stall if you didn't give it enough gas. The combination of a dangerous vehicle and dark, rainy road conditions resulted in me crashing into a telephone pole that night, which slammed down onto the car and could have killed me and my passenger. Fortunately, but for a few bruises and me with two black eyes, we walked away unscathed, though the car was totaled.
    

        My son has also figured out that if he had access to a car, he would be required to chip in to help offset the costs, and he sees no upside to that. His grades are quite good, but his honors coursework is very challenging, and he has been frank about the fact that he thinks school is enough work. He doesn't want to spend his free time working every spare minute. 
    

        He has pointedly said my driving him everywhere is ""great"" for him and asked me why he would go through all the trouble (and my expense) of driving when what we've been doing works for him. With the cost and risk involved in making him a licensed and insured driver, I agree. 
    

        Yes, it's more of a pain in my ass to drive him everywhere, but it's saving me a lot of money and a lot of stress.

The Lincoln Nautilus is one of two Chinese-made vehicles sold in the US under a domestic brand.

        The third generation of the luxury SUV was an immediate hit when it launched in 2024 and is now Lincoln's best-selling model.
    

        Smart design touches, a comfortable interior complete with a panoramic screen, and relaxed driving made the midsize SUV one of the best I've tested — even at a pricey $67,000.

95,2025-02-10,"Starlink provides internet services through its network of low-Earth orbit satellites.
Elon Musk’s SpaceX has awarded a contract to Filtronic worth $20.9 million, sending shares of the British telecom-equipment firm soaring on Monday.
The Sedgefield-based company said it was confident that it would exceed market expectations for revenue and profit both this year and next as a result of winning the contract.
Filtronic’s stock jumped as much as 15% after the news emerged. The firm’s shares were already up more than 150% over the past year.
Last week, Filtronic said its results for the first half of the fiscal year had already been boosted by strong orders from SpaceX, lifting its revenue to £25.6 million ($31.7 million) from £8.5 million in the same period a year earlier.
The company swung to a profit of £6.7 million in the first half, from a loss of £0.5 million a year earlier.
SpaceX became Filtronic’s largest customer after the British engineering firm began supplying ground-based modules that amplify radio frequency signals for the Starlink constellation of satellites.
Starlink provides internet services through its network of low-Earth orbit satellites. As SpaceX launches more satellites to expand its constellation, the company has to expand its ground stations to ensure high speeds and low-latency within its network.
Filtronic signed a five-year strategic partnership with SpaceX in April last year, which included a provision to issue warrants for the U.S. space technology company to take a maximum 10% stake.
SpaceX, formally known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp., now dominates the launch business, sending satellites and payloads into space for NASA, the Pentagon and other clients.
Musk’s businesses have seen their valuations soar since the U.S. election in November. Investors are betting that his strong ties to President Donald Trump will result in more favorable regulations, subsidies or policies for Musk’s many ventures.
Filtronic was founded in 1977 as a spin-off from the University of Leeds. The company initially set out to design electronic components for Tornado aircraft. Filtronic went public on the London Stock Exchange in October 1994, and its market value peaked at around £1.5 billion during the dotcom era. At the close of trading on Monday, the company was valued at £203 million.

96,2025-02-10,"Tesla’s famously sky-high market valuation is based in part on the premise that it is not actually a car company at all, but an AI and robotics company. Selling a $25,000 electric car that can transition the world to a sustainable future is no longer the goal but rather creating AI software that can make cars drive themselves and robots that can replace human labor.
If it was not already clear, however, autonomy is being solved by multiple companies. Besides Waymoâwhich already serves customers with its fully autonomous taxis and is aggressively expanding across the United Statesâ companies in China have been pushing full-steam ahead on automotive autonomy technology of their own. And what is more, they are packaging it in electric cars that are already dramatically cheaper than anything from Tesla. Take the BYD Seagull, a car priced at just $9,500. The Chinese automaker, which has overtaken Tesla in sales there, announced on Monday that it will soon package its “God’s Eye” intelligent driving features in the car.
Business Insider earlier reported on the news, which was announced during a BYD event. Previously, BYD had limited its driver assistance features to higher-end models that cost more than $28,000, according to BYD CEO Wang Chuanfu. In expanding the technology to the Seagull and other cars for no extra charge, Chuanfu said “good technology should be available to everyone.” Other BYD vehicles getting the addition of the technology including cars from its Ocean, Han, Song, and Yuan lineups, as well as its hybrid vehicles.
âGodâs Eye was developed in-house by BYD and will equip the automakerâs mass-market models with features commonly only found on upscale EVs such as remote parking via smartphones and autonomous overtaking on roads,” the company said.
BYD says the level of autonomy present in each car will vary depending on which sensors are equipped in the cars. Some of its pricier cars, for instance, include LiDAR sensors like those found in Waymos, which can offer faster and more precise object detection than cameras alone, particularly in low-light conditions or when a roadway is obstructed by rain or fog. Tesla’s Elon Musk has argued that camera data alone is sufficient when trained against billions of hours of driving from vehicles already on the roads today. Musk has claimed Tesla will launch a limited version of an autonomous taxicab service sometime in 2025.
China’s government has heavily prioritized the transition to electric vehicles with strong incentives, and BYD has managed to turn a profit on its electric vehicles, a feat that has heretofore only been accomplished by Tesla. The importance to China is clear: As the world continues transitioning to EVs, the likes of BYD have been able to push into markets including Europe and South America as Western brands lose share. BYD sold more than 4 million cars in 2024, and has opened factories in markets including Brazil where it has been able to promote itself as creating jobs and contributing to the economies there. That is valuable soft power that China can wield in the future.
Hawks in the United States have said China should be punished for subsidizing industries like automotive in order to “flood” other countries with its products. The U.S. itself participates in similar practices to prop up various industries, however, and BYD, again, has managed to become self-sustainable making quality EVs, and is no longer in need of government support. Developing an entirely new platform for automotive requires significant upfront costs, and there is nothing inherently wrong with a government supporting that upfront if it helps achieve important policy objectives.
BYD started out making batteries for other companies. Being the most expensive and complicated part of an electric vehicle, BYD eventually realized it could enter the industry itself and manufacture cars of its own. It started with hybrid cars more than 15 years ago and is now one of the top automakers in China.
Videos out of China appear to show that the self-driving technology coming out of that country can rival Tesla’s Full-Self Driving (FSD), which has not been able to launch in China over the country’s strict rules prohibiting data from leaving the country. Reports indicate Tesla has been forced to train its autonomous technology on China’s complicated roadways by studying street-view images from the web. It hopes to launch FSD there in 2025, however. Of course, Tesla is notorious for not meeting its projected timelines.
Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk appears to be spending much of his time in Washington, D.C. focused on other priorities, like arguing over the Hitler salute and cutting inconsequential line items from U.S. spending. President Trump last week canceled the roll-out of funds for electric charging infrastructure, and it is expected that tax incentives given to buyers of EVs will be nixed as well. Western automakers are largely still committed to electrification but have slowed their deployment of capital as the growth rate of sales particularly in the United States has come down. The vehicles remain too pricey for many, and consumers feel that chargers are still not widely enough available. Tesla sales have fallen dramatically in key markets including California and Germany, suggesting his recent divisive political moves are having an impact.

97,2025-02-10,"An analyst at work. Investors tend to focus closely on earnings, but a company's balance sheet is ... [+] also of great importance.
“Winning isn’t everything. It’s the only thing,” said football coach Vince Lombardi years ago. Many investors feel the same way about earnings.
Excuse me, Lombardi disciples, but earnings aren’t the only thing. To withstand unexpected hardships or to seize timely opportunities, a company’s financial strength is also key.
Once a year in this column, I celebrate financially strong companies with my Balance Sheet Powerhouse list.
To make it, a company must:
I’ve compiled the list from 2001 through 2006, and from 2011 to the present. This year, 49 companies made the roster, the second-highest total ever.
Companies that make the list deserve praise, but their stocks aren’t necessarily buys. In many cases, the company’s excellence is well-known and the stock price is high relative to fundamentals. Each year, however, I find from one to five to recommend.
This year, I think five of the Balance Sheet Powerhouse companies deserve consideration as stock buys.
I’ve recommended Cal-Maine Foods Inc. (CALM), the largest U.S. egg producer, in this column several times. This is a risky pick in that the company is riding high now, with egg prices soaring. Still, I think this stock is worth holding through ups and downs. It often has a rich dividend yield.
First Solar Inc. (FSLR) is the largest American company in a field dominated by Chinese companies – the manufacture of solar panels. A trade war between the U.S. and China appears imminent. Tariffs on Chinese panels would presumably help First Solar.
Gentex Corp. (GNTX) makes self-dimming mirrors for cars. The stock sells for only 14 times earnings, a cheap multiple in today’s market. (The overall market multiple is about 24). Gentex has consistently grown its revenue about 7% a year. Earnings jumped 11% last year.
Mueller Industries Inc. (MLI), based in Collierville, Tennessee, makes pipes, rods, tubes, valves, refrigerator coils and a variety of other metal and plastic products. Its return on equity (a measure of profitability) has been above 15% seven years in a row. This is a repeat recommendation from last year.
NEXTracker Inc. (NXT) makes equipment that helps large solar installations follow the sun’s movements across the sky. On Wall Street, 28 analysts follow it, and 22 of them recommend it. That worries me a bit (as the performance record of analysts’ darlings is dubious) but I like the stock nonetheless.
Whether I recommend them or not, here are a few companies that should be honored for appearing on the Balance Sheet Powerhouse list nine times or more.
Dolby Laboratories Inc. (DLB), which makes audio equipment, has made the Balance Sheet Powerhouse roster 14 times, including nine in a row.
Gentex has done almost as well, gracing the list 13 times.
SEI Investments Co. (SEI) holds third place with 12 mentions on the list. It’s an investment consultant offering services to portfolio managers.
Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG) has made the roster 11 times. A pair of companies – Arista Networks Inc. (ANET) and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTSH) have achieved it nine times.
The Balance Sheet Powerhouse list is pleased to welcome a dozen new members this year. They include AAON Inc. (AAON), AppFolio Inc. (APPF), Badger Meter Inc. (BMI), Champion Homes Inc. (SKY), Concept Therapeutics Inc. (CORT), Duolingo Inc. (DUOL), FTI Consulting (FCN), and Hims & Hers Health Inc. (HIMS).
Also making their debut: Maplebear Inc. (CART), NEXTracker Inc. (NXT), Royal Gold Inc. (RGLD) and Synopsis Inc. (SNPS).
In 20 outings, my Balance Sheet Powerhouse picks have achieved an average one-year return of 14.1%, which compares favorably with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Total Return Index at 10.8%.
Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn’t be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn’t predict the future.
My recommendations have been profitable 13 times out of 20, and have beaten the index nine times.
A year ago, I recommended three Balance Sheet Powerhouse stocks: Mueller Industries, T. Rowe Price Group Inc. (TROW) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL). Mueller returned 62%, Alphabet 26% and T. Rowe Price 5%. In aggregate, my picks had a 30.9% return, versus 21.6% for the S&P 500. All figures include dividends.
Disclosure: I own Alphabet, Arista Networks, Cal-Maine Foods and Mueller Industries personally and for clients.

98,2025-02-10,"Samsung smartphones might soon fix the worst chink in their armor. According to the South Korean daily FN News, the company is mulling plans to fit next-gen silicon carbide batteries inside its upcoming Galaxy S26 series flagship smartphones. And it seems the Chaebol’s mobile division won’t be pulling any punches.
As per the report citing industry insiders, Samsung could offer a battery as large as 6,000-7,000 mAh in capacity with the upcoming Galaxy S26 series. For comparison, Samsung’s current top-tier offering, the Galaxy S25 Ultra, comes equipped with a 5,000mAh battery. The competition, however, is already offering batteries of up to 7,000mAh capacity at nearly half the sticker price of Samsung’s flagships.
The Korean electronics giant is reportedly keen on deriving benefits of the silicon carbide battery tech, which promises higher energy density, allowing brands to fit high-capacity batteries in smaller packages. Take for example the Red Magic 10 Pro, a phone that is nearly as big as the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but offers a 7,000 mAh battery with 100W fast charging chops.
Samsung, however, is concerned about the hit on battery longevity. To fix that conundrum, the company is reportedly planning to experiment with different material choices, and adjusting the percentage concentration of silicon in the battery anode to achieve a denser, longer-lasting battery.
Another advantage of silicon carbide batteries is that they don’t hamper the charging pace figures. For example, brands like OnePlus and Honor have already managed to fit massive batteries in their latest flagships while simultaneously offering charging rates north of 80W in wired mode.
To put that into perspective, Samsung’s current-gen phones only go up to 45W in wired mode, and far slower in wireless format. The OnePlus 13, on the other hand, allows 50W wireless charging, while Samsung’s best phones can only muster a peak top-up rate of 15W.
Now, the latest report emerging from Samsung’s home market isn’t a certainty that the Galaxy S26 series will finally put an end to arguably the weakest aspect of Samsung smartphones. The shift might take another year, or two, even. But it is definitely reassuring to see that Samsung is paying attention to practical innovations and might not remain a laggard for longer than it can afford to.
The company’s mobile division certainly appears to be chalking the right course lately. As per Counterpoint Research data, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra marked the first time since 2018 that a Samsung Galaxy device has entered the top ten list of the world’s highest-selling smartphones each year.
The new Galaxy S25 series is here and Samsung’s latest flagships come in various colors. Some of these colors are muted and designed for those who want a more traditional experience, while others are more vibrant and designed to help your new phone stand out.
Although most people use a case — and I recommend picking up one of the best Galaxy S25 cases for this year’s phones, you may want a colorful telephone that you can look at, especially if you plan to use a transparent case. However, with seven choices for the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus including the online exclusive colors, and six for the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which color is the best?
Budget smartphones tend to draw less charging power than their flagship counterparts, leading to a long charging time. However, the FCC confirmed that Samsung's upcoming affordable offer, the Samsung Galaxy A56, will charge a little bit faster than the Samsung Galaxy S25.
Per a report from GSMArena, the FCC confirmed in a leaked document that the Galaxy A56 will support 45-watt charging, which might help it charge a little quicker than the Galaxy S25. This comes from the ""status information"" screenshot showing that the budget Galaxy model is rated for 10 volts at 4.5 amps, directly translating it to 45W of battery charging power.
It has been five days since I started using the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and when I began I was very excited to see what the new Now Bar and Now Brief added to the Galaxy AI experience. While both features work, what happened when I started using them was a surprise, as it made me face an uncomfortable truth about my life.
I wondered, is my life just too empty to get much from the latest Galaxy AI features, and if so, am I the only one?
