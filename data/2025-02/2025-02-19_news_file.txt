Nvidia’s new RTX 5070 Ti graphics card is the most intriguing entry in the 50-series lineup so far, promising to outperform last-gen cards that were even more expensive. At $749, it comfortably beats AMD’s $899 RX 7900 XT, trades blows with the $999 RX 7900 XTX, and is closer than I was expecting to Nvidia’s own $999 RTX 5080. It’s a capable card for a relatively good price, and that makes the RTX 5070 Ti an ideal choice if you’re tempted to move to 4K gaming or want a card that can deliver high frame rates for 1440p. 
But like the rest of the 50-series cards, the RTX 5070 Ti is not as much of an upgrade as we’ve come to expect from Nvidia. The card is around 14 percent faster at 4K than the last-generation RTX 4070 Ti and 22 percent faster at 1440p. It’s nearly as fast as the RTX 4080 Super, which launched at $999, and it’s more than 80 percent faster at 4K than the two-generations-old RTX 3070 Ti. Those are decent numbers, but it’s mostly because the 40 series was such a big leap. 
All of this makes the RTX 5070 Ti a good deal at its $749 MSRP, but only if it stays there — and prices are already going up.
Editor’s note: We aren’t scoring the RTX 5070 Ti until the pricing situation is clear at launch on February 20th.

I’ve been testing MSI’s RTX 5070 Ti Ventus 3X OC edition, which looks almost identical to the RTX 4070 Ti Super I reviewed last year. MSI’s tried-and-true Ventus 3X OC cards use a triple-fan layout with a copper baseplate and heat pipes to cool the GPU and memory modules. 
For both my 4K and 1440p testing, I paired MSI’s RTX 5070 Ti with AMD’s latest Ryzen 9 9800X3D processor and Asus’ 32-inch 4K OLED PG32UCDP monitor. I also put the RTX 5070 Ti up against the $999 RTX 5080 — the next step up in the RTX 50 series — as well as the RTX 4080, RTX 4070 Ti, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and AMD’s Radeon RX 7900 XT.
The RTX 5070 Ti delivers what you’d expect from a modern GPU: playable frame rates at both 4K and 1440p with all the settings maxed out. While the hardware isn’t quite as sleek as Nvidia’s Founders Edition cards, MSI’s GPU will fit well into most gaming rigs.
Without DLSS or ray tracing enabled, the RTX 5070 Ti is nearly 13 percent faster than the RTX 4070 Ti Super at 4K and 1440p, enough to make it practically identical to the RTX 4080 at 4K and not far behind at 1440p. You could even overclock the RTX 5070 Ti with the click of a button in Nvidia’s app or by using MSI’s Afterburner utility and get slightly ahead of the RTX 4080 Super. 
The RTX 5070 Ti makes for a great 1440p experience and solid 4K gaming, especially if you’re willing to turn the settings down slightly or overclock the card to squeeze out a little more performance. The next step up in the RTX 50-series line, the $999 RTX 5080, is around 12 percent faster than the $749 RTX 5070 Ti at 1440p and around 15 percent faster at 4K resolution — but you have to pay an extra 33 percent in cash for not much more performance.
The RTX 5070 Ti, much like the RTX 5080, makes the most sense if you’re upgrading from the RTX 30-series models or earlier. At 4K without DLSS or ray tracing, the RTX 5070 Ti is nearly 84 percent faster than the RTX 3070 Ti. It will be a noticeable upgrade if you’re using an RTX 30-series card or older, and you’ll also get access to Nvidia’s Frame Generation technology.
Nvidia’s RTX 3070 Ti, which launched in 2021, was only suitable for very entry-level 4K gaming, in part because it shipped with just 8GB of VRAM. The limitations were especially noticeable in the Forza Motorsport benchmark, where the RTX 3070 Ti averaged a measly 33fps compared to the 109fps on the RTX 5070 Ti.
I’m hoping we won’t see those same limitations further down the line with the RTX 5070 Ti’s 16GB of VRAM. The original RTX 4070 Ti only had 12GB of VRAM, which Nvidia bumped up to 16GB with the RTX 4070 Ti Super. If there was a little more VRAM on the RTX 5070 Ti, then it would help avoid any video memory limits at 4K gaming in the future.
I’ve also been testing DLSS 4 and Nvidia’s new Multi Frame Generation technology with the RTX 5070 Ti. Multi Frame Gen uses the latest AI graphics models, powered by an updated transformer architecture, to generate up to three additional frames per traditionally rendered frame, pushing the RTX 5070’s frame rates beyond what it’s normally capable of at 4K and 1440p. 
Cyberpunk 2077 has been a great test title for DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Gen, demonstrating how Nvidia’s new technique can provide motion clarity improvements with higher frame rates. Without DLSS 4, Cyberpunk runs at an unplayable 15fps average with ultra settings and full ray tracing enabled on the RTX 5070 Ti at 4K resolution. I was able to push that all the way up to 110fps thanks to 4x Multi Frame Gen.
As I’ve argued in my previous RTX 50-series reviews, this still doesn’t feel like a real 110fps because it maintains the same input latency it has after DLSS Super Resolution is applied. Super Resolution renders the game at a lower resolution and then uses AI to upscale it — in this case, from 15fps to 33fps. Multi Frame Gen then creates the three extra frames to make the motion of gameplay look smoother, but it still feels like a sluggish 33fps, so it’s less reactive than a real 110fps when you hit a button or click to shoot.
DLSS Multi Frame Gen still makes the most sense at 1440p with the RTX 5070 Ti, simply because the base frame rates (once Super Resolution is applied) are high enough to make the input latency less of an issue.
While there still aren’t many games that support Multi Frame Gen and DLSS 4, you can force these techniques on with Nvidia’s new app. DLSS 4’s new transformer model even works on existing RTX cards, so you’ll get the benefits of improved image quality if you force DLSS 4 on in games before developers have patched them. 
Like the rest of the RTX 50 series, the RTX 5070 Ti is also a capable card if you want to do video editing or run AI workloads. I found that the RTX 5070 Ti was nearly 14 percent faster than the previous RTX 4070 Ti in PugetBench’s DaVinci Resolve test and Procyon’s AI XL (FP16) test.
Nvidia recommends a 750-watt power supply for the RTX 5070 Ti, which is only 50 watts more than for the RTX 4070 Ti and 4070 Ti Super. The 300W total graphics power is just 15 watts more than the 4070 Ti.
At 4K resolution, the RTX 5070 Ti averaged 271 watts across the nine games tested — a little more than the 245-watt average draw of the RTX 4070 Ti but less than the RTX 4080’s 282W average for almost identical performance.
I only noticed the RTX 5070 Ti hit its max power draw of 300 watts during the Metro Exodus extreme benchmark, and it also maintained the exact same max GPU temperature (68 degrees Celsius) of the RTX 4080 in my open bench testing. It’s great to see Nvidia hasn’t massively increased power or cooling requirements here. 
The RTX 5070 Ti continues the 50-series trend of modest generational improvements. At 1440p, the RTX 5070 Ti delivers a good deal more performance than the RTX 4070 Ti and 4070 Ti Super, but I was really hoping for more at 4K. That would have pushed this firmly past the RTX 4080 and 4080 Super to make 4K gaming even more affordable.
Whether the RTX 5070 Ti is a good value will come down to pricing and availability. Without a Founders Edition to put pressure on board partner pricing, I think it’s going to be very hard to find an RTX 5070 Ti at $749. Micro Center is already listing overclocked models at $999, the same price as the RTX 5080, and only a single card is listed at $749 out of the 12 available. Nvidia insisted that the MSI card we tested has an MSRP of $749, though it was listed as $909 at Micro Center just hours before this review went live. 
I suspect it will come down to availability, too. It looks like there’s a real shortage of GPUs in the market. The RTX 5090 was barely in stock, and restocks are rare right now. Even the RTX 5080 is sold out at most places, and one retailer in the UK says it won’t be getting more for at least six weeks, with some models even further out. 40-series Nvidia cards and AMD’s 7900 XT series also look thin on the ground.
AMD might help with keeping pricing under control, as long as it has stock available. It’s about to enter the market with two new GPUs that look like they’re going to compete directly with Nvidia’s RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070. Nvidia has even delayed the debut of its RTX 5070 until March, which suggests a GPU pricing battle is about to take place at this important part of the market. 
The RTX 5070 Ti is a good purchase if you can actually get one at $749, but it might be worth waiting a few weeks to see how AMD’s performance, price, and availability shape up against Nvidia’s latest GPU.

You would think using a portable solid-state drive would be as simple as plug it into your laptop, gaming console, or digital camera, and then let it do its thing. And while that’s true with many SSDs, there are tons of exceptions hiding out there, leaving you with the annoyance of having to reformat the drive yourself.
See at Amazon
You and your persnickety devices can both be satisfied by the Crucial X9 Pro SSD, one of the fastest and most broadly compatible drives we’ve found, which is just $120 (2TB) right now at Amazon. There’s also a Mac-specific version of the X9 Pro on sale at Amazon for $138 â 21% off â but the regular version also works seamlessly with Macs and the rest of the Apple ecosystem.
The Crucial X9 Pro has so many selling points based on its performance, size, and durability, and we’ll get to those. But the best part is the fact that it’s as close to universally compatible as any drive we’ve seen. The X9 Pro works with both Macs and PCs, which isn’t all that uncommon. But then you add in the fact it also works with Linux, and game consoles, and iPhones, and Android devices, and suddenly the X9 Pro gets a lot more sexy.
Then there’s the speed factor, and speed is always a factor when you’re shopping for a good SSD. The Crucial X9 Pro has a super-fast 1,050MB/s read/write speed, which places it in that upper echelon of SSDs that are fast enough for digital photographers and videographers to shoot directly to the drive and also be able to edit it without compromising quality. That speed comes in very handy when you’re using the Crucial X9 Pro as a game console backup, and also when you’re transferring huge files like 8K photos and videos via the USB-C 3.2 connection.
The Crucial X9 Pro is amazingly compact â just 2.56 x 1.97 inches and a scant 0.39 inches thick â and weighs a feathery 1.3 ounces. That’s ideal for a photographer or videographer’s go bag, or a briefcase if you’re bringing one along on a work trip. The anodized aluminum and rubber construction is not only durable, but also IP55 water- and dust-resistant.
The 2TB model of the Crucial X9 Pro has the quality, speed, and versatility to far outkick its $120 Amazon price point, and the Mac-specific model is a solid buy at just $120 while it’s 21% off for anyone who needs the speed and size of the Crucial X9 Pro but not that near-universal compatibility.

The struggling company has gone through many ups and downs, including allegations of fraud and the imprisonment of its former CEO.
by  Andrew J. Hawkins
Struggling electric truck company Nikola said it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Wednesday and would sell off its assets, effectively ending a challenging journey punctuated by rapid cash burn, allegations of fraud, and the incarceration of its first CEO and founder.
Nikola said it would seek an auction and sale process, pending court approval. The company said it had $47 million in cash on hand to fund its bankruptcy proceedings, implement the sale process, and exit Chapter 11. Nikola listed assets of between $500 million and $1 billion, and estimated its liabilities were between $1 billion and $10 billion, Reuters said citing a court filing.
“Like other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we have faced various market and macroeconomic factors that have impacted our ability to operate,” Steve Girsky, President and CEO of Nikola, said in a statement. “In recent months, we have taken numerous actions to raise capital, reduce our liabilities, clean up our balance sheet and preserve cash to sustain our operations. Unfortunately, our very best efforts have not been enough to overcome these significant challenges, and the Board has determined that Chapter 11 represents the best possible path forward under the circumstances for the Company and its stakeholders.”
“Like other companies in the electric vehicle industry, we have faced various market and macroeconomic factors that have impacted our ability to operate.”
The filing represents a fall from grace for the once buzzy company that aimed to transform the polluting heavy-truck industry into one based on zero emissions. Founded in 2015, Nikola pitched the idea of zero-emission big rigs using hydrogen fuel cell technology, and later said it would include battery-electric trucks as well. The company scored a huge win in 2020 when General Motors announced plans to would help Nikola engineer and manufacture its battery-electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, including the Badger pickup truck. In exchange, GM would acquire an 11 percent equity stake in the startup.
But less than a week later, short-selling firm Hindenburg Research published a bombshell report accusing Nikola of fraud, including the video showing the truck rolling down a hill to simulate driving. The report set off a chain reaction that resulted in founder Trevor Milton’s stepping down as board chair and CEO and his eventual arrest. Later, GM backed out of the equity deal.
In addition to staging the video, Milton was accused of falsely claiming to produce his own hydrogen fuels at below-market rates and obtaining “billions and billions and billions and billions” of dollars’ worth of committed truck orders. He was sentenced to four years in prison.
Nikola went public in 2020, and started shipping its first trucks less than a year later. It ramped up production in 2024, but was losing hundreds of thousands of dollars on every truck it sold. As of the third quarter of last year, the company had only produced 600 vehicles, many of which have been recalled due to defects, costing the automaker tens of millions of dollars.
Nikola was the latest high-profile EV company to go belly after failing to meet high expectations. Other EV startups that failed include Lordstown, Proterra, and Fisker. TuSimple, a self-driving truck company from China, pivoted to gaming tech.

Bosses are running low on empathy. Some want their workers back in the office more often and are becoming less interested in the demands of mental-health-conscious Gen Zers wanting work-life balance.

        They have a good enough reason: An era of revenge quitting may be on the horizon, but right now it's an employer's market.
    

        Meta, Microsoft, BP, and Boeing are just a few of the companies laying off staff in 2025.
    

        Some employers are also getting more creative about how they're letting low-performing staff go, engaging in tactics such as ""stealth firing,"" in which they implement strict return-to-office mandates to make employees' roles increasingly uncomfortable and less appealing.
    

        Others are cracking down on ""little sins,"" terminating workers for small indiscretions. Meta fired some workers who used food vouchers improperly, while some EY staff met the same fate for watching multiple training videos simultaneously.
    

        Joe Galvin, the chief research officer at the executive coaching platform Vistage, told Business Insider that bosses were under more pressure to ensure their employees are top performers.
    

        Workers, on the other hand, are wrestling with what pandemic-era flexibility they're prepared to give up.
    

        ""Maybe bosses are saying, 'I don't have to put up with this millennial or Gen Z stuff,'"" Galvin said. ""There's a common thread underneath it all, and that's the tension between the boss and the worker.""
    

        The power dynamic between employers and employees is a constant pendulum, and it can swing at any moment.
    

        ""When it's an employers' market, which it is right now, companies are much more picky than when it's an employees' market,"" Suzanne Lucas told BI. Lucas is a human-resources consultant and writer who became known for her blog, Evil HR Lady.
    

        Many highly skilled and experienced people have lost their jobs recently. Google has offered buyouts to 25,000 employees, and at least 65,000 federal workers have opted into President Donald Trump's deferred resignation program.
    

        The volume of talent entering the job-seeking pool means ""companies can be really choosy right now,"" Lucas said. ""If you're a slacker, I can find someone to replace you. In other words, employees better be working hard.""
    

        Meta fired about two dozen staff last year for using their $25 meal credits to buy things other than food, but Lucas said it was never really about the actual purchases.
    

        ""Once somebody breaks that barrier, then everybody else starts breaking that barrier,"" she said. ""It's really not a matter of punishing someone for buying toothpaste — it's a matter of making sure everybody knows that there is a line that you don't cross.""
    

        Mona Mourshed, the CEO of the employment nonprofit Generation, told BI workers could protect themselves in a turbulent environment by investing their time in new skills, particularly in learning about AI tools.
    

        ""What's very clear is that within every company, there are some people who are power users, and everyone else is dabbling or not really using it,"" she said. ""We all need to figure out how to make the most of it.""
    

        Mourshed also recommended getting exposure to different parts of the business with projects or teamwork.
    

        ""Do that because, essentially, it enables you to have cross-functional skills,"" she said. ""In your team, there might be some disruption, but maybe that creates an opportunity for you in a different team of the same organization, or potentially another one.""
    

        What's very clear, Mourshed said, is that ""doing the same thing for a decade is a pattern of the past.""
    

        Lucas said not all companies would fire workers for small indiscretions, but if an employer is looking to let people go, those making minor missteps could be first on the list.
    

        ""My advice to the employees is to realize that you need to be a good worker — it's called work for a reason,"" Lucas said. ""Maybe work harder. Maybe now isn't the time to be asking for extra benefits and extra flexibility.""

6,2025-02-19,"GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen took to X on Tuesday to blame wokeness and DEI for the retail chain’s impending exit from Canada and France. The company, which managed to survive the pandemic thanks to the infamous memestock frenzy, has closed more than 700 stores since 2020 as more game distribution moves digital.
In a release, GameStop said that “as part of an evaluation of its international assets,” the company, âintends to pursue a sale of its operations in France and Canada.â Shortly thereafter, Cohen took to X with his comments on “wokeness” and “DEI.”
âEmail M&[email protected] if youâre interested in buying GameStop Canada or Micromania France,” Cohen wrote. “High taxes, Liberalism, Socialism, Progressivism, Wokeness, and DEI included at no additional cost if you buy today.â
Gizmodo reached out to GameStop for comment on its decision to exit Canada and France. According to a recent filing, the company as of late 2024 had more than 200 stores in Canada and 647 stores in Europe.
GameStop’s revenue peaked all the way back in 2011 when it brought in $9.55 billion in sales. That compares to $4.33 billion in 2024, which itself was down 24% from 2023. The company has struggled to fight the broader forces of slowing growth in the game industry and a move to digital distributionâsomething not every gamer appreciates, but has become the reality as companies like Microsoft seek to package games into Netflix-like subscription bundles. Subscriptions means players do not own their games, but Microsoft and others can generate more consistent streams of recurring revenue as well as access a wider customer base.
Cohen with his post appears to be directly saying his company’s decline in physical footprint is not because of this reality, but rather due to worker-friendly regulations, wage requirements, paid paternity leave, or any other policies that do not allow GameStop to take advantage of employees.
Back in 2022, Cohen through his personal investment firm purchased a 9.8% stake in Bed Bath & Beyond and pushed for changes at that retailer; the company went bankrupt a year later. He also co-founded the online pet goods company Chewy.
DEI stands for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and refers to policies meant to support underrepresented demographics in the workplace. The practice has come under intense fire from President Trump and his new administration, which has sought to eliminate such policies from the federal government and the private sector.
Critics of DEI say that the programs unfairly disadvantage Caucasians in a way that is discriminatory, while supporters of the programs say they are a lawful means of ensuring that unconscious biases do not influence the workplace (people tend to hire others who are similar to themselves). Proponents of the programs also argue that business outcomes are better when an organization is diverse, as it can design products that appeal to more demographics.
In the wake of executive orders from President Trump seeking to reign in DEI, a host of companies from Meta to Google have walked back their policies to placate or curry favor in the new administration. Whether the policies were ever effective in the first place or just window dressing is up for debate, but the moves to kill them have been divisive internally. Research suggests tech employees tend to be much more liberal than their leaders. Other companies like Apple, Costco, and the NFL have kept their DEI policies in place.
GameStop nearly died during the pandemic, when foot traffic to stores plummeted and more people downloaded or streamed games instead. Individuals stuck at home saw that wealthy investors were betting the company would fail, and a combination of nostalgia for the once-beloved brand and resentment of elites caused individuals to pile into the stock. GameStop was able to issue new shares and generate billions of dollars in cash to keep itself afloat. It tried using the new capital to modernize itself with initiatives like an NFT platform. The company’s stock is down 67% from a high in 2021 but still appears inflated by social media attention.
Ultimately, GameStop has only managed to survive at this point by cutting costs, including by significantly reducing its retail footprint. The stores that remain today are full of collectibles like Funko Pops and are generally not pleasant places to visit. But maybe now that “woke” is being banned in the U.S., GameStop’s fortunes will turn around.

Apple has launched a new iPhone, but what was expected to be a new iPhone SE announcement this morning has turned into a completely new product line: the iPhone 16e. This isn't exactly a follow-up to the iPhone SE from three years ago, though it officially replaces it. Also gone is the iPhone 14, meaning Apple's iPhone lineup now consists of the iPhone 16e, iPhone 15, and iPhone 16 series. Apple announced the new device online without much fanfare.
The iPhone 16e is available for preorder starting on February 21 for $599, which effectively eliminates the option of a sub-$500 iPhone. Official sales kick off on February 28. Here's what's new with Apple's latest iPhone.
The new iPhone 16E, which is a spiritual successor to the iPhone SE, says goodbye to hallmarks like the Touch ID-infused home button and thick bezels around the display in favor of the modern look that's been headlining Apple's iPhones for the past few years. That means an all-screen front, now employing an OLED panel, with Face ID baked into the camera notch.
Unlike the current iPhone 16 lineup, this iPhone does not use the Dynamic Island system of a floating bar around the front-facing camera that shows live information from apps like Maps and Uber. Here, the camera notch is just a static void. The screen is 6.1 inches, the same size as the iPhone 16, a big leap from the 4.7-inch screen on the third-gen iPhone SE. This is not a tiny phone anymore, a blow to anyone hoping for another small iPhone—especially since Apple killed off the iPhone Mini series a few years ago.
Annoyingly, this iPhone is still stuck with a 60-Hz screen refresh rate even though most other smartphones at this price feature a 90- or 120-Hz refresh rate. A higher rate means a smoother experience using the phone with fluid animations. Apple calls this ProMotion, and it's still only available in the iPhone Pro series, though it's expected to arrive in the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Plus later this year for the first time.
Also notable is the switch from a Lightning charging port to a USB-C port. Apple first switched to the universal port on the iPhone 15 range in 2023, and this update means the entire iPhone lineup finally features USB-C. Unfortunately, like the iPhone 16, the port's data transfer speeds remain the same at 480 Mbps. For faster speeds, you'll need to buy the iPhone 16 Pro.
Apple stopped selling the 2022 model of the iPhone SE and other Lightning-based devices in the European Union in December 2024 to comply with regulations that required the universal USB-C port on devices like phones and tablets. The earlier-than-expected release of the iPhone 16e suggests Apple wanted to quickly fill in the gap and bring a low-cost iPhone back to that market.
Apple's A18 chipset sits inside with 8 GB of RAM, meaning you get the same power as the iPhone 16. Nearly. This chipset has one less GPU core than the A18 inside the iPhone 16, meaning there may be a slight hit to graphics performance when playing games. Naturally, the A18 chip brings access to Apple Intelligence. It's the most affordable iPhone with the suite of AI features, though it's not the cheapest way to access it. That would be the $499 iPad Mini.
While Apple has brought over the Action Button from the higher-end iPhones—this user-customizable button replaced the mute switch and debuted on the iPhone 15 Pro—the 16e is missing the Camera Control button found on those flagship devices.
Apple Intelligence: Speak to Siri with Chat GPT
Camera Control is the fifth physical button on the iPhone 16 lineup. It enables quick access to the camera and allows users to slide a finger on it to change shooting modes. Pressing and holding the button activates Apple’s Visual Intelligence, which lets Siri understand what it's looking at, provide context, and take action. Apple initially restricted the feature to the new iPhone 16 range which has the physical Camera Control button, even if the iPhone 15 Pro was capable of this computer vision trick. However, the iPhone 16e can now make use of Visual Intelligence through the Action Button. It's unclear yet if this functionality will make its way to the iPhone 15 Pro.
Speaking of the camera, it's been upgraded to a 48-megapixel sensor, and Apple touts that the higher megapixel count allows the camera to crop in and offer a 2X optical-like image quality—effectively giving you the experience of two camera lenses in one. The selfie camera is the same 12 megapixels as the rest of the iPhone 16 series.
The other big introduction is Apple's first in-house 5G modem, the C1. This new chip further reduces the company's dependence on external chip suppliers like Qualcomm. This modem won't allow the iPhone 16e to connect to millimeter-wave 5G—the superfast 5G speeds you'll find in certain locations, like dense urban areas, airports, or stadiums. This is a common omission on phones within this price range, which rely on the more widespread sub-6 GHz 5G spectrum.
Apple says the new C1 modem helps improve battery life. The iPhone 16e's battery can last 21 hours when streaming videos, which is 11 more hours than the iPhone SE, and it's even better than the 18-hour claim for the same-sized iPhone 16. Bizarrely, Apple did not add Qi2 and MagSafe functionality to this iPhone, gatekeeping its magnetic accessory system to pricier devices. The iPhone 16e still supports Qi wireless charging, which is slower and doesn't have the benefits of magnets.
What it does retain are the satellite communication features that debuted in the iPhone 14—when you're away from cellular coverage and Wi-Fi, you can message friends and family via satellite and also connect to emergency services and roadside assistance. You can also share your location via satellite through the Find My app. The iPhone 16e also includes Apple's Crash Detection, which can contact emergency services if the device detects you've been in a car crash.
The iPhone 16e makes the iPhone lineup a little confusing because Apple still sells the iPhone 15 ($699) and iPhone 15 Plus ($799), which are more expensive but have a weaker processor that lacks access to Apple Intelligence. Unless you really want an ultrawide camera, MagSafe, or the Dynamic Island, there doesn't seem to be much reason to buy them anymore.

Egg supply issues in the US amid a bird flu outbreak have pushed prices to record highs and made it difficult for stores to keep cartons stocked on shelves.

        In a survey conducted by Numerator, a market research firm, over half of shoppers said they'd seen shortages of eggs or found them out-of-stock at stores, including BJ's, Costco, Target, Trader Joe's, and Publix.
    

        I visited a Costco store in New York City to see firsthand how consumers navigate egg supply issues and price hikes. Here's a play-by-play of how I managed to get one of the last cartons in the store.

The ES90 will be based on Volvo’s Superset tech stack comprising “all modules and functionalities that we will use in our future product line-up.”
by  Andrew J. Hawkins
Volvo’s next electric vehicle, the ES90 midsized luxury sedan, sounds like its got some serious computing chops.
The new EV will come with a dual Nvidia Drive AGX Orin configuration, making it the “most powerful car Volvo ever created in terms of core computing capacity,” the company claims today. The new supercomputer is included as part of a single tech stack called Superset, which Volvo says will underpin all of its next-gen vehicles going forward.
The ES90 will be Volvo’s first vehicle to come with the Nvidia’s system-on-a-chip, enabling it to perform core functions at lightning fast speeds thanks to the computer’s abilities to perform 508 trillion operations per second (TOPS). This will come handy when managing functionalities such as “AI-based, state-of-the-art active safety features, car sensors and efficient battery management.”
508 trillion operations per second
Orin system also represents an “eightfold” improvement in processing speeds over the San Jose-based chipmaker’s Xavier computer that featured in the 2018 announcement of a team-up between Volvo and Nvidia on in-car hardware. The increased processing power to enable Volvo to gradually enhance its deep learning model and neural network “from 40 million to 200 million parameters,” the company says.
The ES90 will be built on Volvo’s SPA2 architecture and will be the second vehicle, after the EX90, to be based on its Superset tech stack. Superset is a modular engineering platform that the company says will be used to make safer cars, more efficiently, and to improve them over time through over-the-air software updates.
Tesla was the first company to introduce the idea of a connected vehicle with updateable software that could improve over timne. Now, the rest of the industry is scrambling to catch up by introducing their own upgradable vehicles. Volvo’s EX90 was intended to be the first major effort, but the electric SUV was delayed by software troubles, and when it eventually arrived it lacked many of its promised features.
Volvo says it envisions a future in which features such as driver assist technology and battery range are able to be improved over time thanks to this new tech stack. And improvements for the EX90 will be translatable to the ES90, and vice versa.
“The Volvo ES90 is one of the most technically advanced cars on the market today and is designed to be improved further with time,” says Anders Bell, Volvo’s chief engineering and technology officer, in a statement. “Built on our state-of-the-art Superset tech stack, the ES90 puts safety at the forefront.”

10,2025-02-19,"The rightwing president of Argentina, Javier Milei, is currently enduring the worst crisis of his presidency. It’s not over his economic policies, whichâdespite a very minor turnaround in recent weeksâhave largely expanded poverty, homelessness, and unemployment in the country. Instead, it’s over a memecoin scandal that has pissed off prominent American HODL-ers who had staked money in the project and are now badmouthing the foreign leader online.
A couple of days ago, Milei dumbly promoted a memecoin project online that, in short order, was accused of being a pump-and-dump scheme. The project in question, a cryptocurrency token called $LIBRA, rose in value by exponential degrees after Milei posted about it on Elon Musk’s platform X. Milei claimed that investing in the coin might be a novel way to “fund” small businesses. The asset climbed to a market capitalization of some $4 billion before ultimately crashing to Earth, thus evaporating tens of millions of dollars in value.
Now, a new report from CoinDesk claims that the creator behind the $LIBRA project, a crypto entrepreneur named Hayden Davis, has bragged about being able to “control” Milei. “I control that n—-,” Davis allegedly claimed in text messages with an unnamed person from mid-December that were viewed by CoinDesk. He apparently added: “I send $$ to his sister and he signs whatever I say and does what I want.” Davis, who runs a firm called Kelsier Ventures, has further claimed that he is Mileiâs adviser and that he has been âworking with him and his team on much bigger tokenization and really cool stuff in Argentina.â Milei’s government has previously disavowed Davis’ claims that he is connected to the administration in any official capacity.
CoinDesk breaks down the claims like this:
In text messages reviewed by CoinDesk, Hayden Davis, CEO of Kelsier Ventures, claimed he could “control” Milei because of payments he had been making to Karina Milei, a powerful figure in Milei’s government, not to mention the president’s sister…
Karina Milei’s office did not respond to a request for comment. Davis did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
It was unclear if any money was exchanged between Davis and Milei’s inner circle in advance of Libra’s launch.
Gizmodo reached out to Milei’s government, as well as to Kelsier Ventures, for comment.
If true, it’s unclear what kind of “payments” Davis might have been making to Milei’s sister or what they were for. However, the CoinDesk story notes that Davis and Kelsier Ventures were the “big winners” of Milei’s recent announcement, as crypto wallets “controlled by the entities netted over $100 million in Libra’s early hours, when it soared to $5 and then crashed over 95%, wiping out millions of dollars of speculative investments.” As a result of the incident, Milei is now being investigated by the government’s Anti-Corruption Office for allegations of fraud. Milei’s government has also announced an investigation into $LIBRA itself, and “all companies or persons involved in” its “operation,” according to a recent statement.
Milei is a favorite in rightwing circles (Elon Musk is notably a huge fan) due to his libertarian economic policies (he has referred to himself as an “anarcho-capitalist”), which have allowed wealthy foreign investors to swoop in and exploit the country. Among other things, Milei deregulated the housing market in Argentina, allowing landlords to jack up housing prices. Western outlets cheered this move, but poverty and homelessness have only skyrocketed since Milei began enacting his “shock treatment” policiesâa strategy he has referred to as taking a “chainsaw” to the nation’s government. Many of those policies have been influenced by a libertarian network based in the U.S., called Atlas.
It should be comforting then (*extreme sarcasm*) that our own president is currently being advised by the very same kind of peopleânamely, billionaire oligarch Elon Musk, who has promised the very same kind of destruction of the federal government that Milei promised in Argentina. Trump is also filling America’s financial institutions with pro-crypto zealots, who promise to pave the way for more DeFi in the economy which, as this incident would appear to demonstrate, doesn’t bode well for our economic future.

Even if you donât trade in an old device, getting the Galaxy Buds3 Pro for $250 is a super competitive price when you consider that’s the going rate for Apple’s AirPods Pro 2. But scoring a pair for just $100 borders on theft. These cutting-edge earbuds hit the market just four months ago to glowing reviews. They boast top-notch ambient sound and AI-powered active noise cancellation, making them one of the best options available. A recent redesign introduces impressive new features, such as real-time translation when connected to a compatible Galaxy phone.
Engineered for an immersive audio experience, the Galaxy Buds3 Pro deliver on all fronts. Each bud is equipped with dual amplifiers and enhanced two-way speakers that create a dynamic 360-degree soundstage. Whether you’re enjoying your favorite playlist or streaming a show, the sound quality is rich, deep, and incredibly lifelike.
Navigating controls is effortless with Intuitive Touch Control, eliminating the guesswork of managing playback, calls, and volume. You have the power to customize commands, ensuring that your Galaxy Buds3 Pro respond exactly the way you want them to.
Samsung has expertly packed advanced technology into a compact, comfortable design while ensuring durability. The Galaxy Buds3 Pro hold an IP57 rating for water and sweat resistance, meaning they can handle intense workouts and unexpected weather without missing a beat. The sturdy charging case is built to withstand daily wear and tear, protecting your earbuds wherever you go.





These earbuds donât just sound greatâthey make a striking visual statement. The sleek redesign features light strips on the back of each bud that illuminate when in use. While you may not see them yourself, they add a stylish flair that will catch the attention of those around you. And thanks to adaptive noise cancellation, you can still stay engaged in conversations when needed.
With or without the generous $150 instant trade-in credit from Samsung, upgrading to the Galaxy Buds3 Pro is an easy choice. Combining exceptional sound, smart features, and a sleek design, these earbuds are a must-have for anyone looking to elevate their listening experience, and if you have some expendable older devices lying around to get you to that $150 trade-in number, you’re making a real score.

12,2025-02-19,Planning for retirement could be tricky if you find yourself on the wrong side of these statistics.
13,2025-02-19,"by Calculated Risk on 2/19/2025 02:00:00 PM

From the Fed: Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, January 28–29, 2025.  Excerpt:With regard to the outlook for inflation, participants expected that, under appropriate monetary policy, inflation would continue to move toward 2 percent, although progress could remain uneven. Participants cited various factors as likely to put continuing downward pressure on inflation, including an easing in nominal wage growth, well-anchored longer-term inflation expectations, waning business pricing power, and the Committee's still-restrictive monetary policy stance. A few noted, however, that the current target range for the federal funds rate may not be far above its neutral level. Furthermore, some participants commented that with supply and demand in the labor market roughly in balance and in light of recent productivity gains, labor market conditions were unlikely to be a source of inflationary pressure in the near future. However, other factors were cited as having the potential to hinder the disinflation process, including the effects of potential changes in trade and immigration policy as well as strong consumer demand. Business contacts in a number of Districts had indicated that firms would attempt to pass on to consumers higher input costs arising from potential tariffs. In addition, some participants noted that some market- or survey-based measures of expected inflation had increased recently, although many participants emphasized that longer-term measures of expected inflation had remained well anchored. Some participants remarked that reported inflation at the beginning of the year was harder than usual to interpret because of the difficulties in fully removing seasonal effects, and a couple of participants commented that any increase in reported inflation in the first quarter due to such difficulties would imply a corresponding decrease in reported inflation in other quarters of the year.
...
In discussing the outlook for monetary policy, participants observed that the Committee was well positioned to take time to assess the evolving outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation, with the vast majority pointing to a still-restrictive policy stance. Participants indicated that, provided the economy remained near maximum employment, they would want to see further progress on inflation before making additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate. Participants noted that policy decisions were not on a preset course and were conditional on the evolution of the economy, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks.

If you're American, you'll likely find this strange; only 11% of us smoke cigarettes. In the rest of the world, however, smoking rates remain startlingly high. A company called Provape combed through data from the World Health Organization to see which European countries have the highest rates of smoking:
 
 
 
 
 
Fairly shocking. Scandinavian countries routinely rank as the happiest in the world, and they dominate the top ten.
 
The figures aren't much better in Asia. Japan is at 30.8%, China at 45.6%. South Korea is at 22.6%, but with a weird gender split: 39.7% of men smoke, but just 5.2% of women.
 
You might think America is doing pretty good at just 11%. But the UK has us beat, at just 5.1%.
 
The three countries with the lowest smoking rates are all in Africa: Ghana at 3.7%, Ethiopia at 4.6% and Nigeria at 4.8%.

Apple just announced the long-rumored iPhone 16E. With a starting price of $599 (up from the $429 SE), it’s now the most affordable smartphone in the iPhone lineup and offers the company’s latest A18 processor, Apple Intelligence software features, and a much better OLED display.
But if you’re mulling an upgrade from the now-discontinued iPhone SE or another smartphone, there are a few key points to consider — and some of them aren’t obvious.
Preorders for Apple’s iPhone 16E begin this Friday, and the phone’s release will follow a week later on February 28th. Check out our StoryStream for even more details, and keep your eyes peeled for The Verge’s full review in the coming days.

18,2025-02-19,"We now know what's different about the OnePlus Watch 3's version of Wear OS, when the OnePlus Watch 2 gets Wear OS 5, and how many updates to expect.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Every Wear OS brand besides Samsung and Google has had such a fraught, confusing history with updates that we had no idea what to expect from OnePlus. Would the OnePlus Watch 3 launch with Wear OS 5, or an older version like some TicWatches? And how quickly would the two promised version updates arrive on the OnePlus Watch 2?

My weekly column focuses on the state of Wear OS, from new developments and updates to the latest apps and features we want to highlight.
Thanks to the OnePlus Watch 3 and clarification from the OnePlus PR team, we have our answers. And I think it's set a precedent for what to expect from any Wear OS watch that doesn't have ""Galaxy"" or ""Pixel"" in the name.
My colleague Nick Sutrich got hands-on time with the OnePlus Watch 3 this past week, and he's highly positive about it so far. It's a major hardware upgrade over the OnePlus Watch 2 thanks to the active crown, fixed health tracking, eye-friendly display, smarter coprocessor, and larger battery capacity.
OnePlus promises a five-day battery life, and Nick's Watch 3 has surpassed this estimate so far. Some credit must go to the silicon-carbon battery, but we can also consider its switch to Wear OS 5: Google added some battery-saving background changes last year that'll pay off in subtle ways for OnePlus Watch 3 buyers.
We're still diving into the OnePlus Watch 3's software to try and flesh out what's new and different. But when we asked OnePlus, their answer was very illuminating:
Gmail supporting email sync, reply functionality, and folder management; Google Wallet supporting boarding passes, concert tickets, and membership cards; and Google Maps syncing and navigating more seamlessly. Google's website should also have a run-down of the upgrades between Wear OS 4 and 5 if you are interested in additional specifics.
Google app minutiae aside, that last portion is illuminating because OnePlus's rep was essentially saying to go to the ""Explore Wear OS 5 features"" page on Android Developers. Unlike Samsung's unique version of One UI 6 Watch or Mobvoi's specific update list for Wear OS 4, OnePlus largely put its software update in Google's hands.
This isn't to say that the OnePlus Watch 3 software is a Pixel Watch 3 clone. OnePlus has its UI quirks, video watch faces, and health features specific to the OHealth app, such as the 60-second health checkup tool.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android

I did note one unique feature: You can prop up your OnePlus 13 and then swipe through TikTok or YouTube Shorts videos using your watch display. I have no idea how many people would want to navigate their feeds with their phones propped up, but at least OnePlus tried something new!
But by and large, OnePlus is offering a ""stock"" Wear OS experience, and some of its ""new"" Wear OS 5 features are things that were missing from its version of Wear OS 4, like emergency SOS, camera controls, and the ability to transfer your watch to a new phone.
I'm perfectly fine with OnePlus focusing on hardware and health upgrades with the Watch 3. It seems to have paid off, and compared to other Wear OS watches that work best within their ecosystem, I think you can wear this with just about any Android phone brand without missing any features because of the ""stock"" Wear OS approach.

Now for the downsides: OnePlus says the Watch 3 will receive two OS updates — like the OnePlus Watch 2 — and two years of bi-monthly security updates through early 2027. OnePlus committed to three years of security updates for the Watch 2, so we're not sure why OnePlus has apparently decided to cut back one year of support.
As for the OnePlus Watch 2, the OnePlus rep said that ""Watch 2 users are expected to receive their OS 5 updates in Q3 of this year."" That July–September stretch is when we'd expect the Galaxy Watch 8 and Pixel Watch 4 to launch with Wear OS 6, meaning OnePlus will be a year behind them.
Up until this point, Wear OS brands like Xiaomi and Mobvoi have fallen a year behind Google and Samsung, only launching Wear OS 4 around Q3 2024. OnePlus obviously has a leg up by launching Wear OS 5 only half a year behind Samsung, but I'm not sure why the OnePlus Watch 2 — which has the same Snapdragon processor — would need another half a year or so.
At this point, I can only assume the year-long update gap between the Wear OS co-creators and third-party partners will never close. Samsung and Google had some trouble updating their watches to Wear OS 5, but nothing like what their partners have experienced.
General Wear OS trends aside, I'm not sure why the OnePlus Watch 3 will (presumably) stop receiving security updates well before it gets Wear OS 7 in late 2027. That seems a bit odd, and I'd like to think OnePlus will still provide some sporadic security support afterward, not just drop major changes and then ignore the Watch 3 entirely.
As it is, with Samsung and Google promising four and three years of support, respectively, OnePlus's two-year promise feels like the one potential blemish to an otherwise exciting OnePlus Watch 3 launch.


Long-lived where it counts
Wear OS updates aside, the OnePlus Watch 3 is an incredibly strong option out of the box thanks to its five-day battery life and blazingly fast charging speed, not to mention a bright, smooth 1.5-inch AMOLED display and a stylish titanium bezel. As long as you don't mind that it's on the large side, there's plenty to love with this Android smartwatch.

    Commentary: Apple's often neglected entry-level iPhone is getting a refresh just as new phone buyers could use one, despite a notable price increase from the iPhone SE.
  
The iPhone 16E has an Action button that can trigger a shortcut or start a Visual Intelligence search.
Apple's $599 iPhone 16E is the biggest refresh ever for the company's lower-cost phone, formerly called the iPhone SE, and it couldn't arrive at a better time. With generative AI requiring beefier specs, and US tariffs on imports from China possibly bringing an increase in costs, Apple's entry-level iPhone might provide enough new features to be worth the upgrade, even with its substantial $170 price bump over the $429 iPhone SE from 2022.
Economic considerations aside, the iPhone 16E represents the rare time when Apple rethinks its entry-level phone. The last iPhone SE refresh, in 2022, primarily added 5G connectivity and the processor of the iPhone 13. This allowed the iPhone SE to capably access faster cellular speeds and run most apps. But compared with similarly priced 2025 Android phones, Apple's iPhone SE was woefully behind. New Android phones costing $500 or less have large 120Hz refresh rate displays, 50-megapixel main cameras and support for wireless charging. Meanwhile, the iPhone SE languished, with a dated design that hearkened back to 2017's iPhone 8. And due to its Lightning port, the SE couldn't be sold in European Union countries now that phones there are required to support USB-C. 
This makes a new, 2025 entry-level iPhone not only welcome but also necessary for Apple's success this year. It should allow Apple to re-enter markets like the EU with a lower-priced iPhone option while providing a device that feels new enough for cost-conscious shoppers who want to get a longer-lasting smartphone before an inevitable creep in prices.
In Apple's iPhone 16E announcement video, the company shows the new phone using various Apple Intelligence features. Here, it's drawing on its ChatGPT integration to field a request for help in creating a dinner party.
Apple Intelligence, the company's set of AI features, appears to be driving Apple to refresh its entry-level devices with more-powerful hardware to increase adoption. This already includes the new $499 iPad Mini, which comes with an A17 Pro processor -- the same as the one in the iPhone 15 Pro -- and the relaunch of the Mac Mini desktop computer, with a $599 model that comes with 16GB of memory.
Apple adopted the same strategy with the iPhone 16E. It gave the phone an A18 processor that can run Apple Intelligence, and it pulled back other features to hit a lower cost, like going with a single rear 48-megapixel camera paired with a 12-megapixel selfie camera. Apple is forgoing the Dynamic Island, which features prominently in the rest of the company's current iPhone lineup, and it omitted faster MagSafe wireless charging and went with the slower 7.5 Qi wireless charging seen on the last iPhone SE (the 16E's USB-C port charges at 20-watt speeds). 
In exchange for those compromises, the iPhone 16E has an enhanced Siri assistant, Visual Intelligence, generative emoji, text editing tools and ChatGPT integration in Siri. And in a nice plus, the iPhone 16E includes the Action Button that can be customized for a number of shortcuts.
In European Union countries, the iPhone 16E will be the cheapest phone Apple sells, at 699 Euros (thanks to its use of USB-C). Currently the 849 Euro iPhone 15 is the most affordable phone Apple sells in the EU, because it's the first model to include a USB-C port.
The iPhone 16E features a single rear 48-megapixel camera and a 12-megapixel selfie camera.
Apple's refreshes of its entry-level iPhone have had a knack for arriving at turbulent economic moments. In April 2020, the company launched a refreshed, $399 iPhone SE during the early throes of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Counterpoint Research, that phone, alongside the iPhone 11, helped sustain Apple during a time when smartphone sales were expected to decline.
And now in 2025, a new 10% US tariff on goods from China could mean a corresponding increase in the cost of electronics. That tariff, along with other rising costs expected for groceries and other goods, may lead families to take a more conservative approach to their personal budgeting.
This makes for a particularly opportune launch of the iPhone 16E, as a more affordable phone option that will get years of iOS software updates. But with the iPhone 16E launched at a price that's well over $500, in some ways we're already seeing this price creep on the entry-level side of Apple's iPhone portfolio. The $429 iPhone SE, from 2022, is no longer for sale on Apple's website, meaning that $599 is now the lowest you can spend for a new iPhone. If you want an iPhone for less, your only options going forward are in the used and refurbished market. 
This also means that Apple's new iPhone 16E faces competition from Android phone rivals like the $650 Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, the $600 OnePlus 13R and the $499 Google Pixel 8A. All three of these reflect their manufacturer's own take on the same strategy Apple used with the iPhone 16E -- they offer access to just enough power for apps and AI, but certain hardware features have been scaled back to allow for a lower price. 
A graphic detailing various iPhone 16E features.
Apple's record of providing consistent options for budget-minded customers has been sporadic at best. Samsung, Motorola and Google release new lower-priced phone options every year, while Apple's multiyear approach takes its entry-level phones to the verge of stagnation.
The 2022 iPhone SE's lack of AI support and a USB-C port for the EU were likely driving factors for Apple releasing the iPhone 16E -- more than actually serving a market need. And by launching the 16E at a price well above $500, Apple certainly isn't aiming it at the truly price-conscious folks who want a new phone for the lowest-possible cost.
The name change from iPhone SE to iPhone 16E might indicate a willingness from Apple to iterate on its entry-level phone more often, but that isn't guaranteed. Way back in 2013, Apple's $549 iPhone 5C presented a similar lower-cost alternative to that year's iPhone 5S, but Apple didn't follow that up with annual refreshes. 
If Apple did iterate more consistently on the entry-level side of its iPhone lineup, it's quite possible the company could dominate the more affordable end of the market. Instead, Apple cedes this space to Samsung, whose $200 Galaxy A models often take a spot in Counterpoint Research's list of the top five best-selling phones overall in the US. For instance, in September 2024, the $200 Samsung Galaxy A15 5G places fifth, with the top four spots all occupied by iPhone models that cost $699 and up.
Whether Apple wanted to refresh its entry-level iPhone or simply needed to update it, the iPhone 16E could be the ideal option for people who ""just want an iPhone"" with modern features for hundreds less than Apple's current flagship models."

The smartphone market is notorious for its fast-paced development, high turnover, and unpredictability. It’s almost as if there’s no opportunity to settle down and catch your breath before the next big thing comes rushing in. On the one hand, it’s good that it keeps mobile technology innovation flowing and avoids stagnating. On the other hand, however, it can be a confusing and chaotic place for people looking for a reliable device they won’t regret buying for years.
That’s the kind of world that the new Vivo V50 is coming into. As the latest member of the brand’s accessible V-series phones, it needs to be able to set itself apart from the rest of the crowd, but it isn’t doing something flashy to accomplish that. In fact, it’s hardly doing anything new at all, so we just had to give this familiar face a test to see if it has what it takes to stand out and make it in this overpopulated market.
Designer: Vivo
It’s almost a tradition for smartphone makers to change their designs every year in an attempt to drum up interest and hype. It’s reminiscent of the old Nokia days when you’d see a weird new design a few times a year, making for a rather large museum gallery now that the mobile brand is dead. It’s great for making news but, when you’re not the only fish in the pond, it’s terrible for brand recognition.
The Vivo V50, fortunately, carries over much of its predecessor’s DNA, which is a good thing because the Vivo V40 and V40 Pro were quite stunning. This year’s model makes a few subtle changes but keeps the overall look the same, retaining the beautiful simplicity found in its graceful curves. That includes the same “Dual Ring Camera Module,” previously called the “Gemini Ring,” that gives it that unique “keyhole” look. It’s not a ground-breaking design by any stretch, but it creates a visual identity that Vivo has thankfully kept for at least one more generation.
Vivo V40 Pro
The subtle changes that Vivo did make include a slightly flatter screen and edges. The company calls it a Quad-Curve design, but it’s really how most flat phone displays look anyway, with a slight curve around the edges to help hide the bezels. The back, however, is still quite curved at the sides, giving a bit of a compromise to both camps in the eternal “curved versus flat” debate.






Vivo V40
Just like with the V40 series, Vivo made some interesting color choices this year. The Starry Blue employs a holographic design that brings the night sky to life on the back of your phone. Admittedly, the novelty will wear off quickly, but it’s still pretty to look at all the time. Our Ancora Red review unit isn’t that bad either, with an elegant luster that’s almost maroon in appearance, giving it a more luxurious character.
Unlike its predecessor, holding the Vivo V50 is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, the edges of the screen no longer run the risk of being accidentally activated because of its flatter design. On the other hand, some will feel that the flat edges conform poorly to their hand when holding the device. It isn’t uncomfortable, thankfully, since the back glass panel is still curved, so you are getting the best of both worlds in a way.
The phone isn’t too heavy, but it isn’t that light either at 189g. Given the very generous battery it’s hiding inside, you might actually be shocked to realize it isn’t heavier than it could have been. It’s a little top-heavy as well, which is to be expected, so triggering the under-display fingerprint scanner requires a little bit more care to not have it fall off your hand.

The design isn’t the only thing that’s the same with the Vivo V50. For better or worse, most of its internals have also remained the same as the V40 last year, with a few key differences. That wouldn’t have been so bad if not for one tiny detail: the V40 also kept the same specs as the V30 before it. Granted, both of those came out in 2024, so it’s not exactly that long ago, but it still doesn’t look good on paper. And as it turns out, not that good in practice either.

In a nutshell, the Vivo V50 runs on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7 Gen 3, a mid-range processor from late 2023, and uses LPDDR4X RAM and UFS 2.2 storage technology. The latter is a bit more problematic as it means slow data reading and writing. For reference, the latest storage technology is UFS 4.0 from 2022. In practice, however, the Vivo V50 does quite OK, with a few frame drops and stuttering when it comes to games. Don’t expect it to score high on synthetic benchmarks, of course, but it will do just fine for most uses outside of resource-hungry mobile games.






As for the differences, there’s some bad news and some good news. The bad news is that the 6.77-inch screen’s resolution has been downgraded from 2800×1260 to 2392×1080. It still fits the “FHD+” label, but that also means that it’s a little less sharp than last year’s Vivo V-series flagships. The good news is that, unless you’re actually particular about it, you might not even notice the difference and still enjoy a vibrant and colorful display.
The bigger difference, literally and figuratively, is the whopping 6,000mAh battery inside this thin device. That gives you at most a day’s worth of use, depending on your activities. It can even last two days if you’re a bit frugal. Charging the V50 doesn’t take that long either, with 90W charging that does meet the average of 40 minutes to charge from 20% to full. Needless to say, you won’t be stressed out from running out of juice in the middle of the day.

The Vivo V50’s theme of keeping what works continues in its camera system. Again, it might not sound great on paper that it’s practically using similar 50MP hardware for over a year, but in photography, even the smallest difference can make a huge impact. That’s definitely true in this case because the V50 impresses by doing more with less.
Unlike its peers, the Vivo V50 leans more towards more realistic color reproduction, though that often makes pictures look colder compared to the vibrant and over-saturated output of other brands. It errs on the side of trying to preserve as many details as it can and avoid over-processing. It doesn’t always work, though, and you can sometimes end up with more noise, especially in low-light situations.



Where the phone’s dual 50MP cameras do excel is in mimicking ZEISS lenses. Portrait photos come out quite nicely, pulling off accurate bokehs with pleasant blurring and accurate separation of foreground and background, even without a telephoto lens. The larger Aura Ring flash also gives a more natural glow to faces, though it doesn’t have much effect on scenes where brighter lighting is needed.

All in all, the Vivo V50 isn’t outstanding in its performance. In fact, it lags behind its rivals in the same segment who have upgraded to newer and better technologies. Those don’t come without costs, though, either in terms of stability or retail price. What the Vivo V50 brings to the table is a tried and tested formula that has proven to be reliable and functional, delivering stability and peace of mind without any hidden costs.
Like some of its more subtle changes, Vivo has also improved the V50 in ways that are, unfortunately, invisible to the naked eye. While its predecessors already met the standard for durability with an IP68 rating, this year’s V flagship takes it a step further with IP69 certification. Although the chances are less likely, it does mean that the phone is protected from a splash of hot water in case of an accident.
Vivo is also promising 3 years of major Android updates and four years of security updates. Unfortunately, the phone isn’t as future-proof as it sounds. If those upgrades bring more features that require not only more processing power but also faster data storage speeds, the Vivo V50 will clearly be at a disadvantage. This is one area where the seemingly harmless old hardware would become a liability instead.

The Vivo V50 is a strikingly elegant phone, one whose design has been verified by its immediate predecessor. Despite its year-old hardware, it can still keep up with most user demands outside of heavy gaming. Even then, all you need to do is tweak the settings to balance graphics with long battery life, creating an experience that is just as enjoyable as an expensive high-end phone.
Normally, we could leave it at that and give the V50 a big round of applause. Unfortunately, it doesn’t exist in isolation, which makes its value even harder to gauge. Its $470 price tag for the top-of-the-line 12GB memory and 512GB storage configuration is definitely tempting, but there are other phones on this tier that offer a lot more while not asking that much more in terms of price. It makes the Vivo V50 a harder sell than it should be, especially with what you’re getting for less.
Not everything that is old is bad. Wine, wood, leather, and brass, for example, can age gracefully and create unique characteristics that bring value to the design. Old can also mean stable, battle-tested, and reliable. It’s not flimsy and unpredictable, bringing a sense of calm and even peace.
The Vivo V50 is like this, confident in how it doesn’t have to tread uncharted territory to bring the value that consumers want at this price point. Its features are already proven, and with a few nudges here and there, it even improves the formula by building on its solid foundations. Unfortunately, it is also being outpaced and outperformed by some of its peers, and only time will tell how long Vivo keep on using the same design before it becomes obsolete.

Former SIE president Shuhei Yoshida blamed the closure of PlayStation's Japan Studio on market conditions, stating that the double-A market for games has disappeared.
By 
    Steven T. Wright
   on February 19, 2025 at 10:26AM PST
Former Sony Interactive Entertainment president Shuhei Yoshida has been speaking out about his time at PlayStation on podcasts, and he recently commented about the closure of PlayStation's Japan Studio. Specifically, he said that the disappearance of the ""double-A"" game market was a major reason for the downfall of the studio.
Speaking on the Sacred Symbols podcast, Yoshida stated that during his time with PlayStation, Japan Studio had ""great products,"" but didn't have many ""AAA-level successful products,"" other than Gran Turismo. ""That became more and more important as the big games became bigger. The indies filled the gap and the double-A market seems to have disappeared. Most of the IPs that Japan Studio had were in that smaller double-A sized group, and the market became really difficult for these kinds of games.""
He cited Gravity Rush 2 as an example, noting that its director Keiichiro Toyama pitched several ideas for a follow-up, but Japan Studio was not able to greenlight any of them due to market conditions. Yoshida noted that the closure of Japan Studio did allow Toyama to create his own studio, which eventually produced the 2024 release Slitterhead. Sony shut down Japan Studio back in April 2021. Some of the studio's best-known games include Ape Escape, the Knack series, and the Demon's Souls remake.
The remnants of Japan Studio can still be seen at Team Asobi, however. The studio, which spun off from Japan Studio, recently developed the acclaimed Astro Bot, which won The Game Awards' 2024 game of the year, among other accolades.

KFC is shifting its US headquarters from Kentucky to Texas.

        KFC's parent company, Yum Brands, said in a press release on Tuesday that the group would designate two brand headquarters in the US: one in Plano, Texas, and one in Irvine, California.
    

        The relocation is a shift from the fried-chicken chain's roots in Kentucky. Yum Brands' headquarters is in Louisville, Kentucky.
    

        The group said the move was designed to ""foster greater collaboration among brands and employees.""
    

        It said Yum Brands and the KFC Foundation would maintain corporate offices in Louisville.
    

        The company said it would also ask KFC's corporate office employees working in Louisville to relocate to Plano.
    

        It added that it would call about 90 remote US-based employees back to the office. It said they'd be relocated to ""the campus where their work happens.""
    

        ""The relocation of approximately 100 KFC US corporate roles will occur over the next six months, while the relocation of 90 remote positions will take place over the next 18 months,"" it said.
    

        Yum Brands is the parent company of four chains: KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and Habit Burger & Grill.
    

        KFC says it has 30,000 stories in more than 145 countries. About 4,100 of those stores are in the US.
    

        In its fourth-quarter earnings on February 6, the group reported 8% sales growth globally, with KFC's sales growing by 6%.
    

        Yum Brands' stock is up by about 10% from the start of the year.
    

        Representatives for KFC did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider sent outside regular business hours.

Renters have quietly enjoyed a nice run over the past two years. A historic wave of apartment construction has tamped down rents from their pandemic-era peak — last year developers finished the most units nationwide since 1974. With so many shiny high-rises hitting the market, landlords are fighting to fill their spaces, offering major discounts and perks to lure tenants. One housing economist even declared 2025 ""the year of the resident.""

        But as the cost of building has increased, the number of cranes on the horizon has dwindled. Formerly eager developers are cutting back on fresh construction plans, laying the groundwork for another apartment squeeze. In other words, the good times for renters are running out.
    

        Time's not up just yet. Developers are projected to deliver another half a million new apartments this year, down slightly from 2024, which should force property managers to focus on keeping their buildings full instead of jacking up rents. The outlook for renters, though, turns gloomier once you look at 2026 and beyond. Apartment supply boomed over the past few years, but demand kept pace — there's no glut of empty units. And the construction pipeline has slimmed down significantly since the glory days of cheap money, when it was easier for developers to secure loans for new projects. While plenty of rentals opened their doors in 2024, apartment builders broke ground on the fewest units in more than a decade.
    

        ""The available inventory of rental housing units may quickly tighten,"" says a recent report from RealPage, a software company that helps landlords set their rents. The real estate analytics firm Yardi Matrix has characterized 2025 as a ""year fraught with change.""
    

        Translation: Snag those apartment deals while you can. They probably won't last much longer.
    

        The past few years have been chaotic for apartment dwellers. Demand for apartments soared in 2021 as renters upgraded to bigger places, moved out of their parents' houses, or said goodbye to roommates in favor of solo living. This surge in ""household formation"" pushed up rents even as people decamped from crowded cities to single-family homes in the suburbs. Zillow found apartment rents rose by more than 20% nationally from 2020 through 2022. At the same time, though, developers were setting the stage for a reversal. At one point in 2022, more than a million new apartment units were under construction across the country. The rush of new builds came to fruition over the past two years: According to RealPage, developers opened a total of 440,000 units in 2023 and a record 588,900 last year, with another 500,000 expected to become available in 2025.
    

        All those new buildings have kept prices in check; as the rental-housing economist Jay Parsons puts it, they ""did what supply is supposed to do."" With lots of new units on the market, renters have more choices and are less likely to tolerate steep rent hikes. Yardi Matrix's data indicates year-over-year rent growth has stayed under 1% over the past 16 months, well below the double-digit jumps of 2022. Landlord concessions — the months of free rent, free parking, and gift cards used to attract and retain tenants — are back in fashion. At the end of 2024, almost 13% of units nationwide were offering concessions, pretty close to the all-time highs from the early months of the pandemic, when hardly anyone wanted to move.
    

        All kinds of renters — not just the high earners who can afford the latest and greatest in apartment construction — have benefited from this development boom. Landlords typically roll out concessions when they're trying to lease up new buildings, most of which are classified as ""luxury"" these days. But even long-standing buildings with cheaper apartments have been offering freebies to keep tenants from fleeing for greener pastures.
    

        ""It's just a simple supply-and-demand game,"" Carl Whitaker, the chief economist at RealPage, tells me. ""As more supply delivers, you have to draw more traffic to your property, and that comes with these incentives.""
    

        The trouble for renters is that property managers may soon find those efforts unnecessary. Developers rely heavily on debt to finance new projects, and the Federal Reserve's interest-rate hikes have made those loans much more expensive, prompting a downturn in construction plans. Builders have been further deterred by the wave of new supply coming to market and the prospect of weaker rent growth at their properties. By doing so, they've laid the groundwork for another apartment shortage — and for rents to start climbing again.
    

        ""The pendulum is swinging dramatically,"" Parsons tells me. ""Unfortunately, apartment construction has a tendency to be way too cyclical, and I don't think that's a great thing for renters or investors.""
    

        Predicting the economy's twists and turns may be hard, but forecasting new-apartment supply is pretty straightforward. If you know how many units are under construction today, you can reasonably estimate the new supply in a few years. These numbers point to a seismic shift in the rental landscape. Apartment construction starts dropped last year to the lowest level since 2013, per RealPage. This slowdown will soon start showing up in the number of new apartments coming to the market. Yardi Matrix expects 524,000 deliveries in 2025, but then only 414,000 in 2026 and 341,000 the year after. RealPage anticipates an even steeper drop-off, from 470,000 new units this year to 265,000 in 2026, with another decline the following year. Christopher Bruen, an economist at the National Multifamily Housing Council, wrote last year that this retreat was ""likely to exacerbate our nation's housing shortage over the longer term.""
    

        US cities won't feel the effects of this pullback equally. Most of the apartments built during this construction renaissance are in the lower half of the country — Austin, Atlanta, Phoenix, and Houston, among others. Some metros in the mountain region, such as Denver and Salt Lake City, have also welcomed a lot of new apartments. Rents in these markets may be slower to rise again, but housing demand in these areas has also been higher than in other places around the country, so the relative relief may be short-lived. As for major coastal markets like New York, Boston, Seattle, and San Francisco, where land availability and permitting hurdles already make it harder to build apartments, it could be even tougher for renters. In a recent earnings call with investors, an executive at Equity Residential, one of the nation's largest apartment owners, described the reduction in supply as ""even more dramatic"" in these markets, where starts were down by 30% in 2023 and by nearly 60% in 2024.
    

        ""With 2025 starts projected to be down again, we anticipate one of the best supply-demand balances in our coastal markets that we have seen in a very long time,"" Alexander Brackenridge, the company's chief investment officer, said.
    

        One complicating factor is construction delays. Doug Ressler, the manager of business intelligence at Yardi Matrix, says completions projected for 2025 may bleed into 2026 and even 2027 because of supply-chain snags or labor shortages, easing the pain for renters. The company expects rents to rise by a modest 1.5% this year, by 1.1% in 2026, and then by 3.3% in 2027. Parsons anticipates even bigger year-over-year growth, in the ""mid-single digits,"" starting in 2026. That kind of increase is a far cry from the pandemic-era rent hikes, but it would still mean the end of this concession-laden era for renters.
    

        If demand for apartments really picks up — if, say, people feel better about their economic prospects or decide that renting will get them more bang for their buck than buying — rent growth could climb even higher. Whitaker tells me it's still too early in the year to tell how many renters will seek out new units during the peak summer months, but there are already signs that this year could be hotter than last. In both November and December, leasing traffic — the number of prospective renters checking out new apartments — increased from a year prior. That may sound ho-hum, but it was the first time since early 2022 that leasing traffic notched two straight months of year-over-year growth.
    

        ""My interpretation is that we are going to see quite a bit of demand this summer,"" Whitaker tells me.
    

        Are we doomed to repeat these cycles, waiting for any bit of housing relief to be revealed as a mirage? Parsons doesn't think so. He points to a national construction fund — which could provide cheaper debt for developers so they're less likely to pull back when interest rates rise — as a bipartisan solution that could smooth out this rental roller coaster. Absent that, though, renters are staring down yet another bumpy ride.
    

        ""It took a perfect storm of factors to drive this massive construction boom,"" Parsons tells me. ""And now a lot of those factors have just gone away.""

Apple’s update of its budget phone brings some new features and drops some old ones.
by  Verge Staff
Apple has launched its new iPhone 16E with an updated design, additional features — and no home button or MagSafe charging. This revamped version of the company’s budget phone will be going for $599 and will include a USB-C port, a notch, a customizable Action Button, a fast A18 chip, and lots of extras. So what does that do for those who might have been looking forward to a smaller phone? Is the new Action Button a good thing? Will you miss MagSafe?
We asked the staff of The Verge for their first impressions of the iPhone 16E. Of course, we will be running a full review of the phone, which will ship on February 28th. But meanwhile, here are some of the feelings that the news has generated in some of our iPhone users.
Look, I’m just as much a fan of physical home buttons as anyone, but maybe it’s time we say our goodbyes for good. The swipe-up gestures for unlocking, returning to the homescreen, or managing apps feels natural and fluid now. I sure don’t miss the excessive bezels, and I appreciate the reclaimed screen real estate to enjoy every dot of edge-to-edge OLED goodness I can. And you know what? As much as I hate the notch, it adds more to the overall aesthetic and user experience than it detracts from it, so I’m fine with that tradeoff, too. – Quentyn Kennemer, commerce writer
I love that Apple brought the Action Button to its new affordable iPhone 16E. It’s one of the better hardware features Apple introduced in recent years. It launched on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max and was included on all iPhone 16 models in 2024. I have mine set to launch a flashlight (and use it all the time), but you can set it to launch other apps, too, like Apple Translate, the camera app, shortcuts, and more. I’m sort of surprised Apple included it since previous iPhone SE mid-year launches usually included a newer processor but in a body a few years old. – Todd Haselton, deputy editor, reviews and commerce
That’s a no for me. Not so much for MagSafe charge speed — wired is always faster anyway — but because the magnetic ring is so handy. You can always add a magnetic case, though, so if the camera is decent enough, I guess it’s not the end of the world. – Nathan Edwards, senior reviews editor
As someone who currently wields a 6.7-inch brick of a phone, I’ve started to long for my iPhone 6S days. At 6.06 inches, the iPhone 16E’s screen size seems like the perfect medium between too big and too small. It’s bigger than the iPhone SE released in 2022 but roughly the same as the standard 6.1-inch iPhone 16 (though it’s also 0.1mm narrower and 0.7mm shorter). That will hopefully be a plus for those of us who want to put our phones in our pockets.
And while the iPhone 16E may be (slightly) smaller and cheaper than the iPhone 16, Apple isn’t skimping out on quality: unlike the last iPhone SE, the iPhone 16E comes with an OLED display panel. It’s nice to see Apple bringing some of its premium features to its budget-friendly devices. – Emma Roth, news writer
I’m slightly relieved to see the new iPhone 16E uses the current A18 processor found in the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus. Previous iPhone SE models also borrowed the latest chips from the pricier iPhones of their time, but there was a part of me that wondered if Apple might surprise us with something like a last-gen A17. (Remember when the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus got year-old holdovers from the 14 Pro?) 
The A18 in the 16E does have one fewer GPU core (four instead of five), but I doubt anyone’s really going to feel that difference. Maybe if you do some side-by-side comparisons with high-end games like Resident Evil 4, but nobody buying an iPhone 16E is going to do that (and apparently nobody’s really buying those games anyway).
Having the latest-gen processor means the iPhone 16E should see years of support, which is one of the benefits of buying an iPhone. And it’s arguably more important these days now that some Android manufacturers have gotten their act together and promised up to seven years of software updates on some of their latest models. – Antonio G. Di Benedetto, reviewer
I love my iPhone 12 Mini, but I’ve also been thinking about upgrading because I want an iPhone with a USB-C port. I probably don’t actually need most of the fancier features on the main iPhone 16 lineup, so the new iPhone 16E seems like it could serve me well for many years.
But do I really want to pay $599 mostly for a USB-C port? My iPhone 12 Mini still works well, especially after I replaced the battery last year. My Lightning cables still work fine for charging, as does my Lightning-equipped MagSafe Duo. I don’t really need a USB-C port for any other reason except convenience.
I think I’m just going to hang on to my iPhone 12 Mini and see what’s in store for the iPhone 17 lineup. But I don’t think I’ll wait much longer to get a USB-C iPhone. – Jay Peters, news editor
At this point, switching between phones is actually pretty simple. Both Android and iOS have made upgrades easy, and you can even switch between operating systems with a cable and a couple of hours. But every time I switch to a device without Face ID or a similar gaze-based authentication system, my muscle memory collapses. Whether I’m paying for stuff, accessing passwords, or trying to lock myself out of social media apps, I use the biometric system more than I realize — and face unlock is faster, more reliable, and just easier. I love the tactility and smashability of a home button, but I’ll happily trade it for that instantaneous, my phone is already unlocked feeling you get from Face ID. – David Pierce, editor-at-large
This design change means the SE finally feels like a modern take on an affordable phone: extremely powerful, packed with AI (for better or worse), and with a full-screen design that doesn’t stick out like a sore thumb.
The notch isn’t exactly Apple’s bleeding edge — I guess we’ll have to wait a few more years for the Dynamic Island to work its way down to the SE line — but it brings with it both Face ID and a lot more screen real estate. It is the end of an era, though: there’s no longer any iPhone on the market that has an uninterrupted display. – Dominic Preston, news editor
It isn’t remotely surprising to me that the iPhone 16E only provides one rear camera. Not only does that mirror the 2022 iPhone SE (which sported a 12-megapixel sensor, compared to the iPhone 16E’s beefier 48-megapixel sensor), but cameras also tend to have a noticeable correlation with phone price. This is an ideal choice for people who don’t need all the fancy camera hardware provided on powerful, more expensive flagship phones.
Photography-driven creative folk typically splurge on the latest Pro or standard iPhone model anyway or use a dedicated camera. The design and performance of the iPhone 16E have already been modernized in line with most of Apple’s current generational lineup — any more and it might as well just be an iPhone 16. – Jess Weatherbed, news writer
It’s been a long time since Apple offered an “affordable” iPhone that doesn’t require making massive feature tradeoffs for the price. That seems to be changing in the new $599 iPhone 16E, and it’s about time. The Android ecosystem has had some really nice options around $500 for the past few years from Google, Samsung, and OnePlus — all with big, modern screens, plenty of storage, and night mode in the camera app. That’s just not a combination you could get from a new iPhone for under $800 over the last three years. 
Some folks might be disappointed by losing the home button or having to switch to USB-C (one of us… one of us…), but I think bringing a modern feature set to the iPhone SE and keeping the price relatively affordable more than makes up for the loss. I’d love for it to be a bit cheaper, and not offering MagSafe is a weird choice. But this might be the phone that finally gets my husband to upgrade from his XR, and for that, I am grateful. – Allison Johnson, reviews writer

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Update (Feb. 19, 3:20 p.m. ET): Added statement from Qualcomm spokesperson.
Apple today announced the iPhone 16e, a $599 spiritual successor to the iPhone SE with a 6.1-inch screen and an A18 chip. There's a lot to like about this midrange smartphone, and it has the potential to shake up the market — potentially disrupting phones like the Google Pixel 8a and the OnePlus 13R. However, Android users should only be worried about one iPhone 16e specification, and that's the Apple C1 modem.
5G modems are one of the rare mobile device components that only a few companies on the planet have created with success. Qualcomm, MediaTek, Samsung, and Huawei are a few of them, and that's basically the end of the list. The iPhone 16e represents a breakthrough for Apple because it's the first device to use an Apple-designed modem, called the C1.
Just like how Apple developed its own in-house silicon and phased out Intel for its Mac processors, you can expect future iPhones to eventually use Apple C-series modems exclusively. The company told Reuters that Apple will roll out its own modems across all of its products, though the exact timeline for that rollout is unclear.
The iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro lineups use Qualcomm modems, which have, to date, been faster and more reliable than anything Apple has been able to develop on its own. For $1 billion, the company bought ""the majority"" of Intel's modem business in 2019. It wanted to make its own modems, but as of 2023, a Wall Street Journal report detailed Apple's struggles — and thus we got iPhones with Qualcomm modems for two more years.
Now, it seems the company is finally on the right track to ditch Qualcomm in favor of its own 5G hardware. The Apple C1 chip features a baseband modem fabricated using the 4-nanometer process and a 7nm transceiver, per Reuters. It lacks millimeter-wave 5G support, but Apple says it offers ""industry-leading efficiency"" that leads to better battery life.
Meanwhile, Qualcomm believes it's still the industry leader in cellular technologies.

""The best commercial smartphones currently feature our leading 5G-Advanced modem-RF system, which uses AI to optimize for the fastest and highest-capacity networks in every country,"" a Qualcomm spokesperson told Android Central. ""We'll soon be unveiling the future of connectivity at MWC Barcelona.""
Apple has no plans to sell C-series modems externally, and that's unlikely to change. So, why should Android fans care? The iPhone 16e and the C1 modem matter because they outline the blueprint for large Android OEMs to ditch Qualcomm themselves for their own in-house chips. Following the precedent Apple just set, it's possible that one day we could see Samsung use Exynos chips for both mobile processors and modems, which would be huge for the Android market.

Apple's reasons for using its own C-series modems are quite clear. For one, they're likely cheaper. Apple spent a billion dollars buying part of Intel's 5G business and maybe more on research and development, but it also pays a fortune to Qualcomm for the licensing of its technologies and the use of its modems. Based on napkin math and build-of-materials estimates from WCCF Tech, Apple could pay Qualcomm over $2.5 billion dollars if it meets its sales targets for the iPhone 16 lineup.
Aside from cash considerations, in-house modems allow Apple to tightly integrate its modems, processors, and software for greater efficiency.
The good news? There's absolutely no reason why Android phones from Samsung or Google couldn't also benefit from a lower build-of-materials cost and greater efficiency. If one of those companies managed to build an SoC and modem good enough, it could leave Qualcomm behind once and for all — result in Android phones with better battery life and potentially a lower price tag.
Android phones are a bit trickier than iPhones, because modems are typically integrated at the SoC level. For instance, because the Samsung Galaxy S25 uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, it also uses a Qualcomm modem. Apple and Samsung would both love to use their own in-house modems, but they're working in reverse. Apple made its processors first, then worked on modems. By comparison, Samsung already has the Exynos Modem 5400 ready — it's inside the Google Pixel 9 series — but it can't quite get its Exynos processors up to par.
Apple's strategy is simple. Start with cheaper, lower-stakes phones to iron out any potential issues with the Apple C1 modem without tweaking flagship iPhones before its 5G technology is ready for primetime. And in a way, Samsung is already employing this strategy. Plenty of Samsung devices already use Exynos processors and modems as the company desperately tries to ramp up its chipmaking quality.
All that's left is for Samsung to make an Exynos chip that can go toe-to-toe with Qualcomm's best. When it does, Samsung will be able to leave Qualcomm behind, having near complete control over the processors, modems, and software in its devices for peak efficiency.
Apple is officially proof that it's possible. However, if recent yield estimates for Exynos chips are any indication, Samsung has a long way to go.

29,2025-02-19,"AMD's RDNA 4 graphics cards are expected to be revealed on February 28, and there are a lot of questions that need answering.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The wait for AMD's new RDNA 4 graphics cards is nearly over. David McAfee, Corporate VP and GM at AMD, recently stated on X (formerly Twitter) that his team is busy preparing the official reveal of new Radeon RX 9000 Series GPUs; it's expected to happen on February 28 at 8 AM EST. Furthermore, McAfee reaffirmed that the Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 are expected to officially launch in ""early March.""
The wait is almost over. Join us on February 28 at 8 AM EST for the reveal of the next-gen @AMD Radeon RX 9000 Series. Get ready to make it yours when it hits shelves in early March. RSVP by subscribing to the AMD YouTube channel: https://t.co/4rkVxeoDIaFebruary 13, 2025
After weeks of delays — the RDNA 4 reveal was originally supposed to happen at CES 2025 but was pulled for reasons related to timing and NVIDIA's own RTX 5000 reveal — it seems like AMD is finally ready to give gamers another option when it comes to high-end desktop graphics.
The reveal really can't come soon enough. NVIDIA hasn't had an easy go with its ""Blackwell"" GPU launch. Minimal availability had scalpers already listing insane prices before the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 even launched. Raw performance gains weren't nearly as impressive as expected, with the new NVIDIA GPUs relying heavily on DLSS 4 to boost performance with what many are calling fake frames — aka those that are rendered using AI.
Slightly more serious is an issue involving faulty drivers released alongside the RTX 5000 cards, causing black screens and unrecognizable hardware. The most damning, though, is the tendency for NVIDIA's most power-hungry card, the RTX 5090, to draw so much power that it's melting power cables, PSUs, and the GPUs themselves.
AMD has the perfect opportunity to claw back a significant chunk of the GPU market with its upcoming RDNA 4 hardware. Gamers and enthusiasts are eager to upgrade, but that doesn't mean that AMD can't release a sub-par product. I'm a longtime AMD user and am generally satisfied with its products (especially its gaming CPUs like the Ryzen 7 9800X3D we reviewed), but Team Red has a bit of a reputation for unsatisfying product launches.
I sincerely hope the RDNA 4 reveal on February 28 goes off without a hitch. NVIDIA needs strong competition in the GPU market to keep it honest. However, I'm imagining five ways AMD can fumble the RDNA 4 GPU launch.

The last thing the GPU market needs is more opportunities for scalpers to take advantage of limited stock. If AMD can't come out of the gate with high numbers at major retailers, the rest of this list is effectively moot, as no one will be able to get the hardware anyway.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
Good news. Rumors have it that AMD has been busy bolstering its stock since early January, when the original RDNA 4 reveal was supposed to happen. That gives it roughly two months of production and shipping as a head start, which should translate into plenty of options on launch day.
I'm still expecting to see most retailers sell out on launch day or shortly after. That's the reality when new GPUs are in such high demand. The RTX 5000 series won't be out of stock forever, so AMD needs to capitalize early with a steady supply of restock shipments if it hopes to compete.

A bit part of AMD's RDNA 4 mystery is pricing, but some recent leaks and rumors have given me an idea of what the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 will cost at launch. Videocardz picked up a leak from X user momomo_us, in which XFX Swift Radeon RX 9000 GPUs were briefly listed at Amazon.
https://t.co/qvqVjmZhf8February 15, 2025
Nothing is confirmed as being true, but it looks like the Radeon RX 9070 could start as low as $649, with the RX 9070 XT coming in at $100 more than its sibling. These are, of course, XFX's Swift, Mercury, and Quicksilver prices, so they don't exactly represent MSRP.
In another leak found by Videocardz originating from the AnandTech forums and user Tomasz Gawroński, Canada Computers listed a bunch of RDNA 4 GPUs from PowerColor and XFX. With the CAD to USD exchange rate undoubtedly adding some wonk, it appears that the non-XT RX 9070 will start at around $586, with the XT version starting at about $697.
It's expected that the Radeon RX 9070 XT will align with the RTX 5070 Ti ($749 MSRP), while the RX 9070 will align with the RTX 5070 ($549 MSRP). It's important to point out that the MSRP is only for the Founders Edition of the GPUs, with custom cards from third-party builders coming in at higher prices.
Nevertheless, it looks like AMD's pricing could be higher than NVIDIA's. That's a situation I've seen play out before, and I hope AMD doesn't make the same mistake with RDNA 4.

AMD's ray tracing capabilities have never been on par with NVIDIA's, with Team Red playing catch-up for years. But with modern games relying more and more on ray tracing to illuminate games, it's no longer a problem that AMD can ignore. Not having strong ray tracing abilities will undoubtedly hamper AMD's success.
I'm not asking for any miracles here. RDNA 4 ray tracing should be better than RDNA 3, but by how much remains to be seen. If AMD is truly hoping to launch its GPUs with a higher price than NVIDIA, it had better have some notable improvements to better compete with Team Green.
AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) is akin to NVIDIA's DLSS; both are upscaling techniques that provide more frames than the raw hardware could produce on its own. FSR 3.1 is the latest standard, relying on advanced spatial upscaling algorithms to perform its magic.
That's expected to change with FSR 4, which AMD now says is based on machine learning. That's a big step toward truly competing with NVIDIA's DLSS, which has so far proven to be the superior technology and will only get better as Multi Frame Generation reaches its full potential.
Not a lot is known yet about FSR 4, but Hardware Unboxed has a great video looking at the differences. From the brief analysis, it looks like FSR 4 has solved some of FSR 3.1's issues rendering smaller high-quality details in fast-moving scenes.
If AMD can wow us with FSR 4 at its February 28 reveal, I know it will seal the deal for plenty of potential customers.
Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a stellar game, but its launch highlighted a growing issue for GPUs. NVIDIA's RTX 4060, with 8GB of VRAM, notably struggles to run the game at a high framerate. It's even bested by the older RTX 3060, and its 12GB of VRAM.
NVIDIA claims that it's solved some of the VRAM problems with DLSS 4, which relies less on VRAM and more on Tensor cores to achieve desirable frame rates. However, 12GB and 16GB of VRAM for the RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti, respectively, continue to not sit well with everyone.
Judging by some of the leaks I've already mentioned, it appears that both the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT have 16GB of VRAM. That's a good sign, and I hope it to be true. The 16GB of VRAM in my RX 6800 has treated me well over the years, and I don't want to buy a GPU with less for the next generation.
Many of my most pressing questions will, hopefully, be answered on February 28 when AMD finally hosts an official reveal of its RDNA 4 GPUs. Whether you're a fan of Team Green or Team Red, I think we can all agree that there needs to be more competition in the GPU market to keep everyone honest.
I'm certain I missed a point or two on how AMD can screw up its RDNA 4 GPU launch, and I'd love to hear in the comments section what you think about the upcoming reveal.

Finding cheap eggs in New York City now feels like a full-time job.
Prices vary widely and are changing by the day amid an ongoing bird flu outbreak that has wiped out more than 23 million chickens this year alone. A dozen Mitlitsky large white eggs were selling for $9.29 at the Key Food on Avenue A in Manhattan. At Trader Joe’s, a mile-and-a-half away in SoHo, the house brand cage-free eggs were going for just $3.49 a dozen.
Shopper Jessica Lee was recently at that location, waiting for the egg section to be restocked.
“It’s just very difficult to get eggs at the moment,” she said. “It’s kind of crazy.”
A Trader Joe’s spokesperson said in a statement that the chain works to keep prices consistent for the same product across all of its locations and only changes prices when its own costs change. The company is one of several that’s been limiting customers’ egg purchases amid surging demand for affordable options.
At Key Food, a retail cooperative where each store is independently owned and operated, prices spotted on Monday varied widely between neighborhoods. A location in Kensington, Brooklyn, had a dozen eggs for $7.49. The Park Slope location was selling a dozen for $10.29. And the store in Port Richmond on Staten Island was selling a dozen for $8.99.
Roy Diaz, a manager at the Key Food in the Bronx's Mount Hope neighborhood, where an 18-pack of eggs sold for $6.49, said this is the most volatile situation he’s seen over 25 years in business.
“It’s such a mess,” Diaz said. “At this point we take any brand, any egg we can get a hold of.”
The reasons for the huge price swings are as varied as the prices themselves — including simple supply and demand, how much leeway suppliers and retailers have to set prices, whether stores get their eggs from big suppliers or smaller local operations, and how much stock stores had on hand before prices surged.
We're collecting info on prices around New York City. Tell us how much one dozen large grade A eggs cost by you using this form.
At the Yonkers location of Stew Leonard’s, a supermarket chain with eight locations around the tristate area, an 18-pack of conventional eggs went for $12.99 on Friday, while premium organic eggs were less than half that price, at $5.99 for an 18-pack.
That’s because the outbreak has largely affected the conventional “caged” egg Pennsylvania farms that supply them, according to store director Andrew Hollis, grandson of founder Stew Leonard Sr.
Three-quarters of the egg-laying chickens lost to the outbreak in 2025 have been conventional “caged” production chickens, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
“The cage-free and pasture-raised organic eggs, they’re not having that issue,” Hollis said. “Essentially it’s better eggs for a lot cheaper.”
And high-end retailers, paradoxically, may sometimes have cheaper eggs than other stores nearby. At Luna Brothers Fruit Plaza, a low-cost grocery stand inside the Lower East Side’s Essex Market, a dozen Nelms jumbo white eggs went for $11.49 over the weekend, while at Union Market a few blocks away, Fingerlakes Farms extra-large brown eggs sold for $4.69 a dozen.
A spokesperson for Union Market said the upscale chain, which has six locations in Brooklyn and Manhattan, was able to maintain low prices in recent weeks because it purchased a large stock of eggs before the current shortage spiked wholesale prices. Smaller bodegas and stands without warehouse space need to purchase their eggs more often, and are more exposed to rapidly changing wholesale prices, industry experts say.
Union Market prices its eggs at a consistent markup over what it pays to purchase them, the spokesperson said, adding that the sticker price might soon increase. The price that retailers in New York pay for a dozen large, Grade A white eggs has jumped 38% since the beginning of the year, according to USDA data.
Like many stores around the city, Union Market has begun limiting purchases to supply as many customers as possible. On Tuesday morning, the grocer’s Lower East Side location was cleaned out of its usual inventory and selling only Brey’s Egg Farm extra-large white eggs for $10.69 a dozen.
Daniel Brey, a third-generation farmer whose operation outside Bethel, New York, produces 228,000 eggs a day, said he’s been fielding multiple calls about egg prices every day, from both long-term customers as well as new buyers like Union Market.
“Everybody’s price-shopping,” Brey said. “They don’t want to jump the gun if they can get a better deal.”
Sullivan County was one of the nation's top egg suppliers when Brey’s father ran the farm in the 1970s, but regional production has largely moved to Pennsylvania, Brey said, calling his operation “the only egg farm left from here to New York City.”
Geography is one reason his farm has ridden out the current storm, Brey said – he’s largely outside the path of the migratory snow geese that are one of the primary vectors for the current outbreak.
“We’re somewhat fortunate so far,” Brey said. “You got to be really really careful who comes and goes on the farm, make sure everything is safe.”
Jada Thompson, an associate professor at the University of Arkansas who specializes in the economics of the poultry industry, said that while bird flu can affect chickens anywhere, that migratory bird pattern has hit the Midwest especially hard.
Pennsylvania, which supplies much of the Mid-Atlantic, has lost some 2.3 million birds in the last 30 days, according to the USDA. Thompson said that can affect regional prices.
The United States lost some 40 million birds when the current outbreak started in 2020, Thompson said. With more than 23 million birds lost this year already, “it’s going to be a pretty substantial year,” she said.
Replacing lost birds takes time, Thompson said – about six months to go from “I need a new chicken” to that chicken laying an egg.
Andrew Hollis of Stew Leonard’s said that tracks with what he’s heard from his suppliers, who are seeking to rebuild their flocks.
For now, New Yorkers can get a little bit of a leg up by knowing their local retailers’ patterns. Hollis said his store receives its egg delivery on Wednesdays, and that shoppers who want to catch the best prices should come in between then and the weekend, when the cheaper options start to sell out until the next shipment.
“Basically ‘just buckle your seatbelt’ is what we’ve been told,” Hollis said. “It’s going to be several months before prices start coming back to reality.”

    The increase on the company's line of laptops will likely be seen by US shoppers in March.
  
Acer's CEO Jason Chen calls the price increase a ""very straightforward"" response to US tariffs.
The effects of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on China will soon be felt by US computer shoppers: Acer says it will raise prices of laptops by 10%.
Jason Chen, CEO of the Taiwan-based electronics-maker, told The Telegraph that Acer will implement the pricing change across the board in direct response to the tariffs. ""We will have to adjust the end user price to reflect the tariff,"" Chen said. ""We think 10 (percent) probably will be the default price increase because of the import tax. It's very straightforward.""
Depending on which analysis you go by, Acer is typically ranked in the top five laptop manufacturers in the US in terms of sales and market share, alongside companies such as Dell, Lenovo and Apple. Prices are expected to increase by at least 10% on goods from electronics-makers, including smartphones and appliances.
In January, the Consumer Technology Association predicted US consumers could take a $90-$143 billion hit on spending power due to tariffs. Since then, tariffs on China have been enacted, but tariffs that were planned against Mexico and Canada have been paused. However, China's dominance in electronics manufacturing will have a larger impact on tech products such as gaming consoles, phones and TVs.

Chen also said that Acer is considering shifting its supply chains and is even open to doing some of its manufacturing in the US. Consumers may still be able to find Acer laptops that aren't subject to the 10% increase; the tariff upcharge won't apply to computers that shipped out of China before February. 
Although the tariffs are expected to affect a wide range of electronics products, Acer is one of the first major tech companies to specify what that cost increase will be. 
Josh Goldman, a CNET managing editor who oversees PC and laptop reviews, said, ""Few, if any, of the major PC manufacturers make better affordable laptops than Acer.
""Given the current situation, it's not surprising that the tariffs will increase prices, but it will hurt average consumers like you and me, as well as education and commercial buyers who are already dealing with inflation and tight budgets,"" he said."

Oracle stock (NASDAQ:ORCL) has been riding high on growing adoption of its cloud services, driven by successful implementation of generative AI capabilities. The company’s management forecasts a doubling of revenue within five years as customers increasingly migrate their on-premises databases to cloud platforms.
We think that Oracle stock looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy at its current price of around $180. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with ORCL stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is very high.
 We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of ORCL stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Oracle along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below.

Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, ORCL stock looks expensive compared to the broader market.
• Oracle has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 8.6 vs. a figure of 3.1 for the S&P 500
 • Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 27.4 compared to 24.4 for S&P 500

[+] on a smartphone screen in front of a stock chart showcasing Applied Materials' financial performance, semiconductor industry trends, material engineering innovations, and global business activity on February 10, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images)
Applied Materials stock dropped by around 8% in Friday’s trading, despite having gained about 3% since the start of 2025. In contrast, Texas Instruments stock, a competitor in the semiconductor sector, has declined by 2% this year. What factors have contributed to Applied Materials’ recent stock movement? Separately, see Motorola Solutions Stock Up 37%. What’s Next?
Applied reported better-than-anticipated Q1 FY’25 results, with revenue increasing by 7% and adjusted earnings growing 12% year-over-year to $2.38 per share. However, the company’s Q2 revenue forecast of $7.1 billion, while reflecting growth over FY’24, still fell short of expectations. Applied attributed this to challenges in its export business stemming from trade restrictions. The U.S. government has tightened regulations on selling advanced chipmaking equipment to Chinese companies, leading Applied to estimate a $400 million revenue loss for the current fiscal year. Additionally, approximately half of this impact is expected in its services segment, which provides equipment maintenance and calibration. Besides regulatory hurdles, demand from Chinese memory manufacturers has weakened in 2025. Applied’s significant exposure to China has been an ongoing concern, with the Chinese market contributing 31% of total revenue in Q1 FY’25, a decline from 45% in Q1 FY’24.
Despite these challenges, Applied could mitigate some of these setbacks through increased demand for high-end equipment used in AI-driven applications and advanced semiconductor process technologies. The growth of generative AI has fueled demand for semiconductors due to the need for greater computational power, enhanced memory capacity, and increasingly complex chip designs. AI also relies on high-bandwidth memory and sophisticated chip packaging. Applied is well-positioned across the semiconductor manufacturing value chain, offering tools and services in materials engineering, process control, and integration. With AI adoption accelerating, the semiconductor industry is shifting toward advanced technologies such as gate-all-around transistors and backside power delivery, which enhance chip efficiency—especially for AI applications. Applied, having invested early in these innovations, may capture market share as AI demand expands. This trend has also benefited Applied’s profitability, with gross margins increasing by 100 basis points year-over-year to 48.9% in Q1 FY’25.
AMAT stock’s performance over the past four years has been highly volatile, significantly fluctuating compared to the S&P 500. The stock returned 84% in 2021, declined 38% in 2022, surged 68% in 2023, and gained just 1% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has exhibited considerably lower volatility while outperforming the S&P 500 over the same period.
Why is that? Stocks in the HQ Portfolio have delivered stronger returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, as evidenced by HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current economic uncertainty surrounding interest rate cuts and geopolitical conflicts, could AMAT stock mirror its underperformance in 2022 and 2024 over the next year, or will it experience a substantial rebound?

It's no secret that we're big fans of Motorola's contributions to the foldable phone space, but one thing we haven't done is gather all of the best Razr Plus (2024) deals into one guide. Well, that changes today. I've scoured every corner of the web to find the best discounts on the beloved flip phone, so if you're ready to buy, you've come to the right place.
I'm talking about offers that knock the price of the Razr Plus (2024) down to just $5.99 per month at AT&T, no trade-in required, or this no-strings Amazon deal that carves a whopping 42% off the unlocked phone.
Easily one of the best flip phones on the market today, the Motorola Razr Plus (2024) boasts a powerful Snapdragon chipset with a bright and spacious cover display, excellent camera tech, and a vegan leather finish that's nothing short of luxurious. The battle of the Galaxy Z Flip 6 vs. Razr Plus (2024) is sure to rage on for a while yet, but if you've decided to pick up Motorola's latest foldable, this is the place to be. 
Patrick Farmer (he/him) is a no-nonsense deal hunter who uses his 10+ years of experience to find the best prices and offer practical shopping advice to our readers. Whether you need a new smartphone, TV, streaming service, or phone carrier, if Patrick recommends a deal, you know it's worth your attention.

The Razr Plus doesn't get quite as many software updates as Samsung's 2024 flip phone, but that's a small price to pay when you consider how many deals are regularly available for the device. After all, there's a reason we called it the ""perfect flip phone"" in our 4.5/5-star review.

Although we don't have any official information just yet, a number of rumors and leaks have suggested that we should be getting a new Motorola Razr Plus at some point this year. 
This 2025 is expected to retain its vegan leather finish and large cover display, with the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that powers the Galaxy S25 series and OnePlus 13 under the hood. You can also expect the phone to sport some new and improved AI features. If we're lucky, Motorola will keep the $999 price tag for the 2025 phone, but there's a chance it'll go up a bit, à la Google's latest offerings.

    Benedict Bridgerton meets a dazzling lady in silver at a masked ball. Can you say, ""Cinderella story""?
  
Yerin Ha as Sophie Beckett and Luke Thompson as Benedict Bridgerton will play major roles in season 4 of Bridgerton.
Longing to slip back into the romantic world of Lady Whistledown and the breathtaking gowns, jewels and hairdos of Netflix's Bridgerton? Season 4 is in production, and Netflix released a sneak peek to tantalize fans of life in the 'Ton.
The sneak peek doesn't spoil any major plotlines, but the scenes of the masquerade ball show off beautiful gowns and tantalizing masks.
The series is based on Julia Quinn's best-selling novel series, where each of the eight Bridgerton children eventually get their chance in the romantic spotlight. Season 4 focuses on bohemian second son Benedict, played by Luke Thompson. He's not looking to settle down, until he meets a charming lady in silver at his mother's masquerade ball. Yerin Ha plays Sophie Baek/Beckett, the Cinderella of this storyline. And -- horrors! -- she's a maid, which will help the show blend the worlds of the waited-on class and those who wait on them.
Golda Rosheuvel is seen as Bridgerton's Queen Charlotte, with Hugh Sachs as Brimsley in the background, in a scene from Bridgerton's fourth season.

While this is the show's fourth season, the plotline comes from Quinn's third book, An Offer from a Gentleman. There's no announced release date yet for the fourth season, though it seems that late 2025 is the earliest fans can hope for. Season 4 will include eight episodes, Netflix's Tudum blog reports.
Many familiar faces are returning -- and one voice, as the legendary Julie Andrews will be back as the voice of Lady Whistledown. Anthony, Kate, Penelope, Violet, Hyacinth, Eloise, Gregory, Colin, Francesca, John and Michaela will all be back, but Simon and Daphne, stars of the first season, won't be in this season.
""What's striking about Season 4,"" Thompson tells Tudum, ""is that it's the struggle between a proper old-school fairy tale -- the romance of it -- and the actual reality of the world. ... You have to hold both of them --  the romance and the reality -- in your hand. In its best version, 'true love' happens in the middle of that.""
You're going to need Netflix, but that's not bad -- it's our reviewers' top choice in a crowded streaming market. Depending on the plan you choose, Netflix costs between $8 and $25 per month. But the pricier package allows you to watch up to four screens at once and create different user profiles. 
And Netflix also offers other hits, such as Stranger Things and Squid Game, so you'll have some solid shows to choose from. And if you want more from the Bridgerton world, in addition to the first three seasons, you can tune in to Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, a prequel showing the powerful queen's rise to power."

    Apple's newest phone is less a successor to the iPhone SE and more a budget iPhone 16, offering value but not as much affordability.
  
The rumors were true: Apple has released a new lower-cost phone… but it's a bit more complicated than a simple follow-up to its more affordable iPhone SE line. The iPhone 16E, as it's called, trims some of the features off the iPhone 16 for a cheaper premium device, but is notably pricier than the budget iPhone SE series. So, who is the iPhone 16E for?
The $600 starting price of the iPhone 16E puts it out of reach for many budget iPhone fans (by comparison, the 2022 iPhone SE was priced at around $430). Instead, Apple has added an option below its premium lineup, much like Android phone makers have done with the $650 Samsung Galaxy S24 FE and the $500 Google Pixel 8A. Perhaps most importantly, the iPhone 16E is now the cheapest device with Apple Intelligence -- and connects to Apple's Emergency SOS satellite texting service.
Even priced out of the budget market, there are a handful of ideal customers for the new iPhone. The most obvious are consumers who want Apple's clean phone and OS design, but are tired of the decade-old screen and home button tech in the iPhone SE line. The iPhone 16E has a full-front 6.1-inch XDR OLED display design with modern features like a 48-megapixel main rear camera, starting 128GB of storage and a USB-C port. It's a current phone with just enough neat specs to not feel dated when you buy it.
The next category of buyers are those who rightly feel the sting in the wallet when paying $800 or more for an iPhone 16. At $200 cheaper, the iPhone 16E keeps the same A18 chip and storage options as its pricier iPhone 16 sibling while trimming some features like the 12-megapixel ultrawide rear camera, Dynamic Island, faster 25-watt wireless charging with MagSafe (iPhone 16E has a paltry 7.5 watt and no magnetic capability) a few video modes like spatial video and connectivity like mmWave 5G, Wi-Fi 7 and Ultra Wideband. But overall, those are nice-to-have perks that are easily lost for a 25% discount. 
This cheaper price could also lure back some former iPhone owners who felt Apple's premium phones got too pricey, while also feeling stiffed by the dated design in the iPhone SE line. 
Sadly, the iPhone 16E is also probably the best choice for buyers deliberately looking for the newest version of an iPhone SE -- and finding no other options in the Apple store. In a blow to budget iPhone fans, Apple has removed the iPhone SE (2022) from its online store (and likely retail stores to follow), meaning they'll have to pick up their next low-cost iOS device at a third-party retailer or get a refurbished one. Folks who wander into an Apple store or go online looking for new affordable phones will have no choice but to pick up the iPhone 16E.
Lastly, there may be some out there who are Apple Intelligence-curious but don't want to spend $800 or more to get in on the new tech. With the A18 chip, the iPhone 16E can run Apple's generative AI features, and will presumably have access to all the features in and coming to the company's pricier premium phones. 
Overall, the iPhone 16E represents a seismic shift for Apple in modernizing its lowest-priced phone, but its higher price leaves behind more budget-conscious buyers. If this is an evolution of the iPhone SE line, it's also losing what made that phone series great: dependable phones with decent specs that could last half a decade or longer for half the price of Apple's basic premium handsets. "
38,2025-02-19,"The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 have soaked up all the oxygen for the big 50-series launch, but for gamers who can’t spend $2,000 on a graphics card, the $550 5070 and $750 5070 Ti remain the more enticing buys. After testing the 5070 Ti, I can already tell this is one of those GPUs that sets a new waterline for a 4K, 60 FPS experience on Nvidia’s GPUs. With few compromises, you can get stable framerates in some of the most demanding games on the highest settings. To take the experience above and beyond to max out that 4K monitor you just bought, multi-frame gen takes care of the rest.
After all, Nvidia promised RTX 4090 performance from a 5070 at less than half the price. After tests, the $750 MSRP card is closer to RTX 4080 Super performance without AI frame trickery. That kind of promotion doesnât sound as catchy, but who cares? Getting new graphics for less than last yearâs second-best GPU sounds like an excellent deal. Unfortunately, itâs not since pernicious pricing has upset Nvidiaâs ecosystem, and PC gamers are getting the short end of the stick.
For review, Nvidia sent Gizmodo the Asus Prime RTX 5070 Ti. Itâs the first time Nvidia has decided to unleash its âTitaniumâ edition GPUs alongside the baseline graphics cards. Itâs like Nvidia is trying to create a new tier in its lineup. If the 5090 is ultra-premium and the 5080 premium, the 5070 Ti should be âsub-premium,â a step above the $550 RTX 5070, even though Nvidia calls the two cards âa family.â Nvidia claims the Ti performs at least 500 more TOPS of AI over the base 5070. It has 4 GB more VRAM, 2816 more CUDA cores, and 896 GB/sec memory bandwidth compared to 672.
Still, thatâs more than you can say for last yearâs $800 RTX 4070 Ti Super from 2024. If you compare the cards based on raw year-over-year performance, the 5070 Ti is only a few percentage points superior to the card from last year. In some cases, that performance boost is enough. The Blackwell architecture helps you achieve higher framerates in games with more ray tracing capabilities, like Alan Wake II, and it can make the difference between getting above 60 FPS or below it, such as in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2.
At 4K, the 5070 Ti can barely hit 60 FPS at ultra settings in most games I tested. Honestly, thatâs beastly, and if you like the idea of multi-frame gen, thatâs all you need for premium gaming performance without dropping even more cash to join the Blackwell generation. Anybody on an RTX 20- or 30-gen card holding out hope for Nvidiaâs cheaper cards can breathe a sigh of relief. Now suck in a breath because thereâs a wrench in the works.
All the latest cards in Nvidiaâs Blackwell are getting more expensive due to a muddy mix of low supply, high demand, Trump tariffs, and goodÂ old-fashionedÂ greed from scalpers. With stock being so tenuous, things will get worse before they get better. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is set to launch on Feb. 20 at 9 a.m. ET, and we suggest you donât bother buying this card at the cost of anÂ RTX 5080.
The Asus Prime RTX 5070 Ti is a 2.5-slot, three-fan GPU with a sleek, relatively minimalist design that wonât turn eyeballs from a casual PC gamer. The brushed steel underside will be what you see most once you have it seated in your case. A sloped side runs down to the fans, bearing the GeForce RTX logo, though thereâs no RGB to see. The card also has a physical switch to launch the card in either quiet or performance BIOS modes, though the GPU is quiet enough at peak I canât imagine you would ever have a need to turn on quiet fans. Why else did you get this GPU if not to get as much performance from it as possible?
This is a non-overclocked card with 16 GB of VRAM (compared to the upcoming RTX 5070âs 12 GB). There are three DisplayPort 2.1 and one HDMI. The extra benefit of this card is that it will switch off fans when it recognizes that internal temperatures are below 50 degrees Celsius. If you have a case that produces cavernous echoes, the Asus Prime may be a better choice. That being said, it wasnât exactly an easy card to seat. My 12VHPWR connector was an incredibly tight fit, more than on an MSI-brand 4070 Ti and 4080 Super or the RTX 5080 and 5090 FEs. It took a concerning amount of force to get my power cable slotted in correctly.
The PC I used for testing remains consistent across the new RTX 50-series. The desktop includes an Intel Core Ultra 285K CPU and 32 GB of LDDR5X RAM. For cooling, it uses an iCUE H150i Elite liquid cooler, and for power, thereâs a 1,000 W Corsair RM1000e Plus Gold power supply. The RTX 5070 Ti FE and the Asus Prime require a 750W PSU minimum. The previous 4070 Ti and Ti Super required a 700W PSU. Thatâs not a major jump, especially compared to the RTX 4090 to 5090 (850 W compared to 1,000 W).
The Olympic-level leap in synthetic benchmark performance between the RTX 5080 and 5090 was staggering. The jump from the RTX 5070 Ti to the 5080 is still significant but less dramatic. In 3D Mark Speed Way, the RTX 5080 scores 8,692, while the 5070 Ti does 7,761. I found a 1,435-point difference in 3D Mark Steel Nomad and a 1,700-point difference in Time Spy Extreme.
Compared to the RTX 4070 Ti Super, the 5070 Ti managed 13,615 in Time Spy Extreme compared to 11,625 on the older card. In Port Royal, a superior test for real-time ray tracing capabilities, the 5070 Ti scored 4,027 points over its older brother. Thatâs a wider gulf between the RTX 4080 Super and the 5080. Better yet, those point values are near-equivalent to the 4080 Super.
In-game benchmarks were less dramatic. The sub-premium Nvidia GPU, which I found, was the absolute minimum for getting a set 60 FPS at 4K in many games. However, in some of the more intensive titles, youâll still need to compromise on some ray tracing settings to get the necessary 60 FPS. Sure, thatâs the base standard these days for gameplay, but itâs also what you need to get the most out of Nvidiaâs multi-frame gen.
In Cyberpunk 2077, with Ultra settings, balanced DLSS mode, and no path tracing, you can reach about 60 FPS. With path tracing enabled, the game hit closer to 48 in benchmarks. When you enable 4x frame gen on those settings, youâll hit closer to 100 FPS. But this isnât a magic trick for turning lead into gold. Actually, playing under those settings doesnât feel as responsive as those frame numbers suggest they should. You need to hit 60 first before enabling frame gen.
The generation-on-generation leap wasnât dramatic at all in some games. For Horizon Zero Dawn: Remastered, I benchmarked 117 FPS on the RTX 5070 Ti and 114 FPS on the 4070 Ti Super. In Alan Wake II, the newer GPU averaged around 45 FPS without enabling path tracing effects and DLSS on balanced settings. Thatâs better than the average of 35 FPS on the 4070 Ti Super. You can finagle some settings to hit the necessary 60 FPS. Add in 4x frame gen, and that game can technically hit close to 160 FPS on an RTX 5070 Ti.
I wanted to know if the RTX 5070 Ti was the right card to play some recent big-hit games from last year and today. InÂ Dragon Age: The Veilguard, I managed, on average, 77 FPS on balanced DLSS and max settings, practically the same as what I saw on the RTX 4080 Super. It was similarÂ toÂ Marvelâs Spider-Man 2, though with more dips in framerate, depending on what happens on screen. I did just below 60 FPS with âvery highâ ray tracing settings. For a stable framerate, you need to shift the needle higher for routinely smooth gameplay and for frame gen to be most effective.
Beyond the most demanding games from the last few years, I wanted to know if the RTX 5070 Ti is a good card for those who may not be coming from the RTX 40 series but from the RTX 20- or 30-series GPUs. When I popped on with Kingdom Come II: Deliverance, a game that isnât yet propped up with multi-frame gen, I could hit 110 FPS in the beginning battle portion of the game with DLSS on balanced mode. The RTX 4070 Ti Super could average, on average, five to 10 frames less in those same scenarios.
I have yet to try overlocking on this card or the RTX 5080. There is reportedly enough headroom for players to get even more from their cards, possibly pushing the 5070 Ti to the edge of the âbest bang for your buckâ category. Unfortunately, I simply donât know if youâll be able to get one close to the $750 mark. Best Buy currently lists the Asus Prime at $900.Â Micro Center has it listed for $750 just before the launch date of Feb. 20. I can pray that stocks and prices will remain consistent, but I doubt any deity is listening.
I would have an easier time recommending it if it didnât cost $150 more than Nvidiaâs minimum MSRP. Asus has jumped the price of its Blackwell 50-series prices by nearly 20% since the RTX 5090 launch. Whoâs to blame? Nvidia, Asus, scalpers, President Donald Trumpâs tariffs? The cards cost what they cost, and it’s a lose-lose situation for consumers. I want to recommend it for gamers who finally want to upgrade their setup to a 4K standard, but I canât if the card costs between 16 and 20% more than it should.
Those with older 20- or 30-series RTX cards in their machines stand to gain a great deal from the RTX 5070 Ti. Itâs an excellent uplift that does what it needs to for $750 and makes a case for itself among the broadening Blackwell lineup. Pay attention to prices, and if you canât get it for below the cost of an RTX 5080, hum a tune, watch the clouds, and pretend you can be patient for a few months more.

          Nvidia pushed the $550 RTX 5070 release back to March, giving AMD time to reveal its Radeon RX 9070 GPUs.
        

          The Nvidia RTX 5090 and 5080 are near-sold out, but Zotac is simply selling directly to consumers through Discord.
        

          CES 2025 brought us tons of fun gadgets, but January also offered new Samsung Galaxy S25 phones and Nvidia RTX 50-series GPUs.
        

          As Nvidia RTX 5090 GPU is in such hot demand many stores are already sold out, but we suggest you don't get fooled by both the scalpers or anti-scalpers on eBay.
        

          Some gamers are already camping out during one of the coldest times in the year to get their hands on a $2,000 graphics card.
        

          Nvidiaâs RTX 5090 Founders Edition is a two-fan GPU thatâs seriously hefty, though somehow smaller and more menacing than the RTX 4090.

App Store regulation continues
Brazilian regulator CADE is holding a public hearing on February 19 to discuss Apple and Google and their competitive digital market ecosystems. An antitrust complaint was filed against Apple in 2022 by Brazilian regulator Conselho Administrativo de Defesa Economica, or CADE. After an investigation and a bad ruling for Apple, an unreasonable implementation timeline was proposed and quickly overturned.While the regulator waits for its next official court date, it has set up a public hearing to discuss matters around regulating Apple and Google's digital marketplaces. The notice was initially reported by MacMagazine and shared by 9to5Mac.The hearing is set for Wednesday, February 19, at 2 p.m. local time. Participation is open to the public, but registration for contributions to the hearing ended on February 12.The hearing is titled ""Competitive Aspects of Mobile Operating Systems Digital Ecosystems,"" and representatives from Apple and Google will be in attendance. Epic Games, Match Group, the Coalition for App Fairness, and others will also make statements.Apple has already implemented changes to the App Store in the United States to remove anti-steering rules as a result of the Epic vs. Apple trial. The Brazilian regulator will likely seek similar changes, but the back and forth will likely continue for some time.The initial ruling finding Apple guilty of anti-steering practices still holds, but the expected implementation timeline and fines were overturned by the judge while Apple appeals. The initial expectation was that Apple would have to implement changes within 20 days or face fines of up to $43,000 per day.There is no news around when the next hearing will be where Apple will appeal the charges. There's a chance appeals and hearings will continue for months to come before Apple is ultimately forced to comply in some way or another.

41,2025-02-19,"A surprise player in the electric vehicle market topped January's leaderboard for sales in the United States.
According to Electrek, the Honda Prologue led the pack with 3,744 cars sold, continuing its unexpected upward trend. It was released in March 2024 and became the seventh-highest-selling EV in the country last year at just over 33,000.
The Ford Mustang Mach-E finished second behind the Prologue last month, posting its best-ever January with 3,529 units sold — a 173% spike from January 2024.
That surge propelled the automaker to a January record of 5,666 total EVs sold and made up for the decrease in sales of both the F-150 Lightning and the E-Transit van. Despite the former's 15% drop from December into January, the electric truck still finished fourth overall, with 1,907 models sold.
Hyundai's Ioniq 5 slotted in at third, increasing its sales by 54% for a total of 2,250 models sold. Its Ioniq 6 also recorded an increase in sales but finished eighth at 871 units sold.
Meanwhile, Kia sold 1,542 EV6s and 1,232 EV9s in January, finishing fifth and sixth in the nation, respectively. The Subaru Solterra was close behind at seventh, with 1,052 models sold.
Though the list is not exhaustive — neither Tesla nor GM announces its monthly sales — Honda, Hyundai, Ford, and Kia all reported higher EV sales to start 2025 following a strong end to 2024.
Electrek wrote that U.S. consumers bought nearly 133,000 EVs last December, accounting for a record-breaking 8.8% of all new cars sold. It also cited data from Cox Automotive's Kelley Blue Book, which relayed that this flourish capped off a year-over-year improvement of 7.3% for the industry, with 1.3 million EVs purchased in 2024.
The Trump administration's plan to reverse EV tax credits as part of the Inflation Reduction Act has likely fueled demand from those looking to take advantage of the benefits while they're still around.

46,2025-02-19,"NVIDIA's RTX 5070 Ti arrives on February 20, but how does the RTX 5070 Ti compare against its siblings at MSRP?

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

NVIDIA's RTX 5070 Ti graphics card launches on February 20 at 9 AM EST, and it's expected to involve similar stock shortages and high prices that I saw with the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 launch just a few weeks ago.
NVIDIA isn't releasing a Founders Edition for the RTX 5070 Ti. Instead, it's all up to NVIDIA's hardware partners to release custom versions, which vary in price and performance. So far, I've seen listings from ASUS, Gainward, Gigabyte, MSI, Palit, PNY, and Zotac at US and UK retailers, and there should be more options coming down the line in the future.
I'm warning you now: the RTX 5070 Ti launch is likely to be just as rocky as the launch of its more powerful siblings, with most cards selling out nearly instantly. I've put together this guide to help you find RTX 5070 Ti stock, and I've also taken a look at reviews to see whether or not it's actually worth buying the RTX 5070 Ti at MSRP or beyond.

The RTX 5070 Ti's $749 MSRP doesn't mean that's what you'll be paying for the new GPU. It's all well and good that NVIDIA set a price for the mid-range card, but it doesn't plan on releasing a Founders Edition at that price.
In fact, it's not releasing a Founders Edition at all. You'll have to wait for the RTX 5070's delayed March 5 launch for another FE graphics card.
Instead, third-party builders are supplying the new RTX 5070 Ti GPUs, and they aren't required to stick to the planned MSRP. The cheapest RTX 5070 Ti that I spotted in the US, for example, is the $750 MSI Shadow listed at Newegg. That's great to see, but it'll undoubtedly be one of the first options to sell out.
On the other hand, the most expensive — so far — is the ASUS TUF Gaming OC Edition for about $1,000 at Best Buy. Considering ASUS TUF Gaming is usually one of the cheaper brands, it doesn't look good for heavy hitters like the ASUS ROG Strix.
Pricing is still mostly hidden at the retailers stocking the cards, so expect higher prices when they're revealed on launch day.
Newegg's Shuffle hardware lottery was last seen during NVIDIA's RTX 30-series launch, and it's been resurrected to help handle the overwhelming demand for the RTX 5070 Ti.
Even if you plan on attempting to buy a card directly at launch time, it might be worth signing up for the Shuffle draw.
You must be a Newegg member (sign-up is free), and you must put your name in for the draw as soon as the program opens. If you win, you'll receive a notification and will be able to purchase the GPU within a limited time frame.

The NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti review embargo was lifted on February 19, a day ahead of the official launch. Opinions seem to vary quite a bit. We, unfortunately, didn't receive our own RTX 5070 Ti to test as we did for our RTX 5080 review and RTX 5090 review, but there are plenty of opinions to check out around the web.
Due to the lack of a Founders Edition card — which is usually what's sent out for initial reviews — our friends at Tom's Hardware and PC Gamer each reviewed different versions of the RTX 5070 Ti. I'll start with these (mostly) positive reviews before getting into some of the more critical impressions.
It's important to note that the reviewers emphasize pricing and MSRP in these reviews, ultimately coming to the conclusion that the scores hinge heavily on the $749 MSRP set by NVIDIA.
In PC Gamer's case, it's noted that 20% should be deducted from the score if MSI's Ventus 3X version of the 5070 Ti costs more than $900. That would drop the review score to 66%. Not great.
Gamers Nexus, my go-to for honest and critical PC hardware video reviews, dives deeper into the RTX 5070 Ti's pricing issues in its review. The video, titled ""Do Not Buy: NVIDIA RTX 5070 Ti GPU Absurdity,"" should give you an idea of GN Editor-in-Chief Steve Burke's opinion of the ASUS Prime RTX 5070 Ti he reviewed.
The full review is worth watching for the in-depth testing results and explanations, but I pulled this snippet from near the start of the video:
""The TL;DW upfront is that the 5080 is about 12% to 16% better than this [RTX 5070 Ti] in some of the 4K gaming scenarios we tested. The 5070 Ti is about 28% to 35% ahead, at best, of the 4070 Ti, again in those 4K scenarios. But it comes down into the 20% to 28% range when you're at 1440p. Additionally, the lead over the 4070 Ti Super — which is really the one that's easy to lose track of, but is important because it's the closest sort of price analog from the most recent generation — is only 7.8% to 20% in a lot of 4K situations but were commonly 12% to 16%. And the worst case one we saw was an impressively bad 3.9% better for the 5070 Ti versus the 4070 Ti Super. So, again, based on the pricing we're expecting for launch and also kind of just the MSRP, we don't think you should buy this video card.""
Hardware Unboxed is another excellent source for hardware video reviews, and it has its own RTX 5070 Ti review to check out. HU has both the Gigabyte Aero ($980 at Best Buy) and the MSI Ventus 3X to test, and I pulled this conclusive quote from the end of the review:
""If sold at the $750 US MSRP, the 5070 Ti would be a reasonable buy, at least in the current market. [...] When compared to the 4070 Ti Super at 4K, the 5070 Ti is on average 11% faster, with margins seen as high as 24% in our testing, though margins of 20% or larger were quite rare as that 11% average would suggest. [...] Typically speaking, the 5070 Ti is going to end up less than 15% faster than the 4070 Ti Super.""

Whether or not you should buy — or, in this case, attempt to buy — the RTX 5070 Ti ultimately comes down to what sort of hardware you're currently using in your PC.
Judging by the reviews and benchmark results, you can expect minimal performance gains compared to the RTX 4070 Ti Super (which had an $800 MSRP when it launched) and roughly 15% worse performance compared to the RTX 5080.
Considering I'm already seeing RTX 5070 Ti launch prices that match (or exceed) the RTX 5080's MSRP, the wide-angle market view isn't looking too good. That, of course, ignores the fact that it's nigh impossible to find an RTX 5080 at MSRP.
With that in mind, I don't suggest you buy an RTX 5070 Ti if you already have one of the upper-mid-range RTX 40-series GPUs, like the RTX 4070 Ti or the RTX 4070 Ti Super. Needless to say, if you're the owner of an RTX 4080 or RTX 4090, you should be very happy to hold onto the hardware you already have in your PC.
If, however, you're coming from an RTX 30-series (or older) GPU, the performance gains are going to be a lot more pronounced. I'm still working with an AMD Radeon RX 6800, and it's about time it's replaced with something newer. I just don't know if the RTX 5070 Ti is the right choice with its inflated pricing.
My opinion on the matter is echoed in the Tom's Hardware RTX 5070 Ti review:
""So, who is Nvidia targeting with the RTX 5070 Ti? People with an RTX 3070 to 3080 (or lower) GPU who want to upgrade will find plenty to like. It will be about 50% faster in raw performance, and the new features can make it feel like more of a step up than that. At least there are no glaring flaws with the product other than concerns with availability and the possibility of scalpers spoiling the party. But if you already have an RTX 40-series GPU, you should give this generation a pass until something truly compelling comes out.""
Furthermore, the Hardware Unboxed RTX 5070 Ti video review also contains similar advice:
""For those of you still using an older GPU such as the RTX 3070, for example, the 5070 Ti is offering on average 103% greater performance at 1440p and 155% greater performance at 4K. So, a massive upgrade there, though the MSRP has increased by 50% (or rather 22% if we adjust for inflation). You're also getting twice as much VRAM, which is a big one, given the RTX 3070's 8GB buffer is regularly run over these days.""

It's also important to keep in mind that AMD is about to officially reveal its RDNA 4 Radeon 9000-series GPUs on February 28. AMD's new cards were delayed for weeks, assumed, at least in part, due to letting NVIDIA reveal its new hardware before setting expectations and prices, but they're now expected to launch in early March following the reveal.
Following NVIDIA's CES 2025 presentation, I was sure that the RTX 5070 would be my next GPU. However, as more information leaked out from AMD's side, the Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT — which were rebranded to better compare to NVIDIA's RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti — have become a lot more tempting.
AMD could still screw this up by setting prices too high for the performance and features on offer, but it's great to see some much-needed competition for NVIDIA arriving soon. If you don't manage to land an RTX 5070 Ti on launch day or in the days and weeks following, AMD's new RDNA 4 GPUs could be an enticing alternative.
NVIDIA's RTX 5070 Ti launches on February 20 at 9 AM EST. Some retailers already have stock listings, but many prices remain to be seen. If you're eager to get a 5070 Ti on launch day, you'll want to be at your PC and ready to click right at the time of release.
NVIDIA has confirmed a delay for its RTX 5070, which was originally expected to launch alongside its RTX 5070 Ti sibling. The new launch date is March 5, 2025, about a week after AMD reveals its RDNA 4 hardware.
NVIDIA is having a hard time with RTX 5000 availability, so it makes sense to delay the launch and allow retailers to build up more stock. Furthermore, it allows NVIDIA some wiggle room of its own after AMD's RDNA delays. Whether or not anything meaningful arises from NVIDIA's delay remains to be seen.

47,2025-02-19,"WeRide shares have soared since the China-headquartered company went public on the Nasdaq last year.
Nasdaq-traded shares in WeRide, a China-headquartered autonomous vehicle technology supplier, soared by another 28% on Tuesday, closing at $40.40, following word at the end of last week that AI-chip supplier Nvidia had bought stock in the company.
Tuesday’s gain followed an 83% rise on Friday after a SEC filing showed Nvidia’s purchase of 1.7 million shares. Combined, WeRide’s stock has more than doubled in two sessions, giving it a market capitalization of $11 billion. The U.S. stock market was closed on Monday.
WeRide, which holds autonomous driving licenses in China, the UAE, Singapore and the U.S., went public on the Nasdaq on Oct. 28 at $15.50 per American depository share. The IPO and a concurrent private placement were expected to raise $458 million. Investors include Zhengzhou Yutong Group, a supplier of electric buses, Qiming Venture Partners, a Shanghai-headquartered investment company, and Alliance Ventures, whose three shareholders are Renault, Nissan Motor and Mitsubishi Motors. Board members include Qiming’s Duane Kuang, a past member of the Forbes Midas List.
Headquartered in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, WeRide was formed in 2017. Founder and CEO Tony Han, who controls a 7.6% stake, worked as an associate professor of the electrical and computer engineering department at the University of Missouri from 2007 to 2017. He was the chief scientist of autonomous driving unit at Chinese search heavyweight Baidu Inc. from 2014 to 2017. Han holds a bachelor’s degree in electrical and computer engineering from Beijing Jiaotong University, master’s degree in computer engineering from the University of Rhode Island, and Ph.D. in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
Though WeChat’s shares have soared, the company financials have been in the red. WeChat lost $121 million in the six months to June last year, on revenue of $20.7 million.

Welcome to the latest edition of Food52 Founder Amanda Hesser’s weekly newsletter, Hey There, It’s Amanda, packed with food, travel, and shopping tips, Food52 doings, and other matters that catch her eye. Get inspired—sign up here for her emails.
Apologies: I didn’t quite finish my homework on pizza ovens, so my findings will make their way into a newsletter in the coming weeks. Today features a different follow-up: your NYC cultural recommendations (see below).
And on Saturday (Thursday for previous Dansk purchasers!), we’re coming out with these perfectly sculpted Dansk salad servers. Do they remind me of melon ballers or snowball throwers? Can’t decide. Either way they are awesome and I want them. Get in line…behind me!
We’ve got loads of new content coming your way, including a flurry of Instagram series in the coming weeks; follow us here. Last week, we debuted It’s Fine, a show from the soaring Toronto-based creator and fellow messer-upper Tess Gigone. On her show, Tess fumbles and charms as she makes famous dishes for the first time—the first episode captures her tackling crème brûlée. We did a fun interview with her here.
We also featured Lord’s chef Ed Szymanski on Yes, Chef—he made his celebrated quail toast!
I like a winter salad that embraces the season and doesn’t try to act like it’s summer. When it’s cold out, give me bitter greens, anchovy, and garlic to hover over!
When I recently made a Vietnamese dish that required a lot of bowls, I was reminded how much I love this handy set of nesters. The ubiquitous Duralex set is practical, but these are finer, made of a thinner (but just as sturdy) glass, and feature little beak-like pour spouts. They’re perfectly sized for prep work. Bonus: They’re made of borosilicate so you can put them in the microwave.
I asked you for ideas of things to do in NYC (part of a New Year’s resolution to get out and enjoy the city I live in)—and thought you’d like a short list of some non-obvious treats, shared by friends and fellow readers:
• Speakeasy Magick: A mix of magic experiences.
• The Wooster Group: Theater productions.
• Municipal Arts Society: Weekend walking tours with themes like Lower Broadway, 1850s, and Subway Art.
• The Bowery Boys: A Gilded-Age-mansions downtown walking tour.
From a longtime community member: “There’s some great classic architecture in lower Manhattan, e.g., the NY Supreme Court building and the Federal Courthouse (my old haunting grounds for work years ago, and awe-inspiring every time you enter), the Revolutionary War era churches, and the stock exchange, etc. I have a special place in my heart for the Stock Exchange building because it was built on land once owned by my sons’ 10 times great-grandfather, who came with the Dutch to New Holland in 1662—before he crossed the East River with some other brave souls to found Bushwick, which they called ‘Boswijck,’ which means ‘little town in the woods.’”
Hawksmoor: Go for their English Sunday roast with Yorkshire pudding and all the fixings.
The Four Horsemen: Just get in, that’s the hardest part; the rest is a pleasure!
Aska: Precise cooking, dramatic lighting, exceptional wine pairings!
Quarters: On the second floor of a nondescript building in Tribeca is the most civilized cocktail lounge, and you get to sip a pretty drink amidst lighting and furnishings by In Common With.
And now I’m back in Portland on a photo shoot that was so cold, I stood on the heat registers to keep warm. Send in the woolens!

And so you'll forgive me for sort of re-using a headline here – but this situation is much more akin to the Hindenburg disaster from which the phrase originates.
This is harsh. And some people won't like that – notably, the investors in Humane. But don't feel too badly for them, they can afford the zero dollars they'll be getting back here. And actually, a few might get some of that $116M – depending how much debt was on the books to pay off.3 Certainly not getting any money out of this deal are the employees of Humane. The company had raised something to the tune of $240M, so the purchase price wouldn't nearly clear the rest of the preference stack even if it could clear the debt. So feel badly for them. At least Humane was able to find a home that will ensure they all have jobs, if they want them. Kudos for that.4
Yes, Humane was a startup and startups are hard. Still, they clearly made it harder on themselves and there are some lessons to take away from that...
First and foremost, the PR strategy was an obvious disaster from the get-go. This is  easy to say in hindsight, but many people were saying it in real time. From their grandiose but nebulous introduction video to their first product tease on stage at TED, it was seemingly less a sound strategy than a vignette of cliches. I don't know the founders Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, but from most accounts you hear, they absolutely wanted to leverage their Apple backgrounds and lay out a bold vision to try to make that proverbial dent in the universe. But as a startup, you obviously shouldn't do that.5 You shouldn't do that first and foremost because it's expensive and cash is king when you're a startup. But you also shouldn't do that because it paints just a massive target on your back.
And the Apple pedigree will actually just make that target even larger. I'm guessing there was some degree of ""let's lean into it, not shy away from it, and play it up"" but again, that's just a bad strategy. It just sets expectations way, way, way too high. And even in the case of product perfection – which will never happen with a first product, just ask, um, Apple – you're setting the company up for a let down.
And the let down came in a major way with those first reviews of the Ai Pin. That's a nice way of putting it. It was more like a beat down. But again, this was set up by that initial PR strategy for the company. So what could have been a ""stealth startup tackling a new space with a big vision launches first product"" morphs into ""hyped-up, massively-funded product from team that helped make the iPhone, sucks"". And that sucks for everyone involved, but again, namely the employees who obviously put a ton of work into bringing this product to market. They were all teed up for the takedown by the roll-out strategy.
That included a $699 price point which was obviously never going to work for this product. And on top of that, a monthly subscription fee. Yes, these may have been the prices needed so as not to just completely bleed out (money) right out of the gate, but that itself just speaks to the product roadmap failure here. 
If the above was easier said in hindsight, this absolutely is, but it's still no less true: the first version of the Ai Pin should have been a much simpler, and thus, far less expensive product. They obviously thought about this, but perhaps wanted to ""go for it"" with a complete, iPhone-like product from day one. Again, you're a startup. You have to start far smaller than, say, a laser-projected screen. Make a pin that does one thing well, not four or five things ranging from just okay to poor.
Perhaps a second version does two things well. Maybe it adds a camera. Probably still not the laser-projector. Probably never the laser-projector, but I digress...
This leads to something they undoubtedly couldn't have fixed without that benefit of hindsight: timing. Humane started building in a world before ChatGPT kicked off the true AI revolution. Had they launched afterwards, I think it would have been obvious to create a simple pin where all it does is act as a wearable ChatGPT communicator. That's it. That's the product. Sort of like Siri, but with an AI that is infinitely better. And no screen. It would have to tether to your smartphone, but still, I think a lot of people would have been compelled into buying this just to try out. Especially if the price was right. Say, $199?
Why do I say this is obvious? Because many other startups have been trying to work on and launch this in recent months. Yes, even after the failure of the Ai Pin (and Rabbit, etc). Because again, they're learning from what not to do here. And their timing is better. But they also lack one key ingredient which Humane would have had: Sam Altman was not just an investor, he was their largest shareholder.
I mean, my god, what a timing miss here. Sure, that undoubtedly would not have stopped OpenAI itself from working on their own hardware and perhaps eventually competing, but well, it's 2025 and there's no sign of any immediate ChatGPT wearable. Had Humane have had better timing, they could have had a product which would have made a compelling case. Alas...
Anyway, it's basically impossible to time a market, but Humane simply didn't give themselves enough flexibility and optionality to be able to get in a better position to be right place/right time. They burned far too much money making far too complicated and expensive of a product and then painted a giant target on their backs to jack up the difficulty mode for no obvious reason other than hubris. Presumably someone around the table knew that the Ai Pin wouldn't be received well in the market, but either no one spoke up or the company had no choice given all the time and money burned getting to that point. And so they shipped.
That is something that many startups also fail to do – and certainly many hardware startups. But to question Alfred Lord Tennyson, tis better to have shipped and lost than never to have shipped at all? Hard to say here given all of the self-owns. Hopefully HP's printers benefit from the lessons...
1 Aka, the Mac McClung showcase.

2 Kudos to John Gruber for correcting calling an HP acquisition here. Sometimes, snark pays off. 

3 Given this was a hardware startup, this amount may simply be used to pay off any outstanding debt, would be my guess.

4 In my experience, in such unfortunate situations, there are often other offers -- yes, even for a company as problematic as Humane as they undoubtedly have interesting patents, if nothing else. So perhaps there were other offers giving them slightly better terms, but wouldn't have found homes for those employees. Just a guess, but again, I'm glad they found landing spots.

5 This feels related to an issue you see come up a lot with many (not all, but a lot) of startups that launch from people who come out of long-time work at Apple: a startup is almost the opposite of Apple. You can't -- and shouldn't -- aspire to build the perfect product that millions will use out of the box after years of building in secret. And you shouldn't launch it on stage as if that's going to be the case. Obviously you want to dream big, but you have to be realistic too. Start smaller -- as Apple itself did -- and grow into that. That should be the aspiration. Put in the early, messy work to get to the point where you can become the next Apple and can ship products the way in which they do one day. One day far away.

[+] smartphone screen in front of a stock chart showcasing Barrick Gold's financial performance, mining industry trends, gold market activity, and global business developments on February 9, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images)
Barrick Gold stock (NYSE: GOLD) posted strong Q4 2024 and full-year results, fueled by increased production, reduced costs, and improved cash flow. Net earnings for 2024 jumped 69% year-over-year to $2.14 billion. Operating cash flow grew 20% to $4.5 billion, while free cash flow more than doubled to $1.3 billion. Following the results announcement, the stock saw a slight uptick. As an aside, with earnings approaching, see How Copart Stock Might React To Upcoming Earnings.
Gold production rose by 15% in Q4, bringing the full-year total to 3.91 million ounces. Copper production saw a 33% increase in Q4, reaching 195,000 tonnes in 2024. The company met its annual production targets, with growth in key operations, particularly in North America and Africa. The gold cost of sales declined 3%, and total cash costs fell 5%, bolstering profit margins. Higher gold and copper prices in 2024 contributed to revenue and margin growth. Copper prices benefited from global supply constraints and rising demand for renewable energy and electrification. The company reported record-high EBITDA and free cash flow, enhancing its financial strength. EBITDA climbed 30% to $5.19 billion, the highest level in over a decade.
 For investors seeking a less volatile alternative to individual stocks, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and generated over 91% returns since inception.
Over the past four years, GOLD stock has seen significant volatility. The stock delivered returns of -13% in 2021, -6% in 2022, 8% in 2023, and -12% in 2024.
 The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, a group of 30 stocks, has shown less volatility while outperforming the S&P 500 over the same period. Why? HQ Portfolio stocks have provided stronger returns with lower risk than the benchmark index, as reflected in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. With ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty related to interest rate policies and geopolitical tensions, will GOLD stock follow its past trends from 2021, 2023, and 2024 and lag behind the S&P over the next year, or is a strong rally ahead? Separately, see How Are Export Restrictions Impacting Applied Materials Stock? 
Barrick Gold’s robust production growth, cost efficiencies, favorable commodity prices, and disciplined capital allocation drove record results in 2024. While operational risks and geopolitical challenges persist, the company is in a strong position heading into 2025. Barrick forecasts gold production between 3.15 – 3.5 million ounces and expects copper output to increase to 200,000 – 230,000 tonnes, supported by expansion at the Lumwana mine. Additionally, the company plans a 35-day shutdown at the Pueblo Viejo mine in Q1 2025 for upgrades. While our Barrick Gold valuation suggests a 16% upside from current levels, external factors such as gold price movements, Federal Reserve policy shifts, and geopolitical developments will likely be key influences on the stock’s trajectory.

52,2025-02-19,"The U.S. used electric vehicle market is experiencing an evolution driven by the increasing availability of vehicles, shifts in consumer behavior, and the ongoing maturing of the transportation electrification ecosystem. Following a steady climb in late 2024, the volume of used EVs has already reached an all-time high.
That’s the view from Recurrent Auto’s Q1 2025 Used Electric Car Prices & Market Report, which offers a comprehensive look into used EV trends, highlighting the shifts in market dynamics, consumer preferences, and lingering adoption barriers. From the report, it’s clear used EVs are accelerating in adoption, driven by key factors like the growing variety of EVs available in the marketplace and the ongoing surge of lease returns. So, what’s in store for this year?
More people are buying used EVs than ever before.
The sheer variety of used EVs entering the market is among the most compelling findings from Recurrent’s report. A few years ago, Tesla was the dominant player, but today, that landscape is shifting—major brands like Ford, Chevrolet, Hyundai, and Nissan are emerging with a growing presence and offering a range of vehicle types to meet diverse consumer needs.
“One of the biggest trends we’re seeing is that used EV shoppers now have options,” said Liz Najman, Director of Market Insights at Recurrent. “Consumers are no longer restricted to a single make or model when looking for a used EV. Instead, the broader selection they have to choose from is helping increase overall adoption and interest in the market.”
Among the most sought-after models, the 2023 Nissan Ariya stands out, receiving accolades as the Best Used EV of 2025. With up to 300 miles of range and a technology-forward design, the Ariya is setting a high standard for what buyers expect from an EV, whether pre-owned or new.
States across the U.S. are also seeing a rapid rise in used EV adoption. California remains the epicenter of EV adoption, but states like Texas and Florida are now major players, with the three states collectively representing 45% of the used EV market. New York, Illinois, Georgia, Oregon, and Washington follow closely behind, signaling that the appeal of used EVs is spreading well beyond traditional EV strongholds.
Despite the impressive growth of the used EV market, several key barriers that prevent broader adoption remain. Battery life is top-of-mind for many, making potential buyers wary of the long-term viability of used EVs.
“A counterpoint to confront any myths about battery longevity is that we have not yet seen widespread battery degradation and failure,” said Najman. “The EV batteries we’re tracking today are lasting even longer than most experts expected.”
To date, only 2.5% of EV batteries have been replaced, with less than 1% of vehicles from model year 2016 and newer needing replacement. Well-maintained, used EVs offer a promising lifespan—putting to rest many concerns about battery degradation.
Also, the lack of consumer awareness about how to buy a used EV poses a challenge. Many still lack confidence in navigating the used EV market, especially when it comes to understanding factors like battery health, electric range, and potential incentives. Education, transparency, and reliable data will be crucial to help build consumer confidence moving forward.
As more EVs make their way into the used car market through organic pathways like lease returns and trade-ins, the supply of affordable EVs will continue to grow in 2025. It’s worth noting that the pre-owned market is quite predictable and less impacted by changes in policy or production compared to new car sales. Recurrent predicts that more than 100,000 leased EVs will funnel into the used car market in 2025, with that number jumping to 650,000 by 2027. With prices for used EVs remaining attractive, particularly as 57% of used EVs are priced under $30,000, there is a unique opportunity for consumers to get into an EV at a fraction of the cost of a new one.
“Now is the time,” Najman advises. For those considering switching to an EV, there’s no better time to take the plunge. The key to the future success of the used EV market will be consumer education and continued improvements in battery technology. As awareness grows, more buyers will recognize the long-term value and sustainability these vehicles offer."

The iPhone 11 from 2019
Apple's iPhone 16e marketing and trade-in pricing is designed specifically to get iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 users to upgrade. It's not as if Apple will turn any buyer away, but it is very clearly setting out its stall that the iPhone 16e is for people who last bought an iPhone in 2019 or 2020. Six years on from the iPhone 11 and five years on from the iPhone, this is the best iPhone to upgrade to and Apple is aiming to sweeten the deal.The first clue of the market Apple is aiming for with the new iPhone comes in the comparisons. ""iPhone 16e has the best battery life ever on a 6.1-inch iPhone,"" says Apple's press release, ""lasting up to six hours longer than iPhone 11 and up to 12 hours longer than all generations of iPhone SE.""Apple then compares the A18 processor in the iPhone 16e to the A13 Bionic processor in the iPhone 11. Unsurprisingly, the new processor is faster than the old, but Apple didn't just search for the comparison that makes the A18 look the best.Instead, Apple wants users of the A13 Bionic processor to know how much faster the new iPhone will feel. Given that iPhone batteries from 2019 or 2020 will be degrading by now, it also wants to present the new iPhone as having a miraculously longer-life charge.If Apple hooks iPhone 11 or iPhone 12 users in with these features, it then works to seal the deal with the pricing. Whether users choose to trade in their old iPhones through Apple or through their carrier, Apple is promoting how much money they will save on the new model.The new iPhone 16e starts at $599, which is significantly more than the $429 of the iPhone SE that it replaces. Where the old iPhone SE's strongest selling point was that it was much lower cost than any other iPhone, the iPhone 16e is now only $200 less than the iPhone 16.That's still low enough make it a bargain, given what features it provides, but it's also high enough to be a barrier. Except Apple itself is offering to take an old iPhone 11 for up to $120 in trade-in value, or up to $170 for an iPhone 12.Those trade-ins make the iPhone 16e more affordable, but Apple doesn't stop with its own offers. For once, it lists specific carrier offers, which in this case start with $400 for an iPhone 11 —  or $599 for an iPhone 12.So people who have held on to their iPhone 11 since 2019 can get the new iPhone 16e from $199. And iPhone 12 users can get it for free.Way back in 2013, Apple's Phil Schiller said that the company would never make a cheap iPhone. But that doesn't mean it can't arrange its pricing cleverly when it wants to target certain buyers.

I want to keep hold of that small form factor for as long as I possible can. I am going to be so annoyed when I’m finally pushed into buying a bigger iPhone.


No MagSafe, a poorer camera, and a disturbingly high price, for starters.If they were aiming at this iPhone 11 owner, they missed badly.

55,2025-02-19,"The RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 have dominated the spotlight for Nvidia’s 50-series launch, but for gamers unwilling to drop over $1,000 on a GPU, the RTX 5070 Ti stands out as a more appealing option. Positioned as a high-performance midrange option, the latest GPU is said to offer a significant upgrade over the previous generation and is more or less a cut-down version of the RTX 5080.
But how does it stack up against the RTX 4080 Super? Can it offer a better performance package at a lower price point? We break down the key differences to help you decide which one is right for you.
The RTX 5070 Ti will be available for purchase starting February 20 and comes with a suggested retail price of $750. Considering the launch pricing and limited availability of the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080, the RTX 5070 Ti will likely see inflated prices at release, with limited stock making it harder to find. At the time of writing, the cheapest RTX 5070 Ti that we could spot was on Best Buy retailing at $900.
Meanwhile, the RTX 4080 Super launched in January 2024 with a starting price of $999. After one whole year of its launch, the GPU is nowhere to be seen with limited stock and prices going upwards of $1,500.
The new RTX 5070 Ti sits right under the RTX 4080 Super in terms of specifications. It has 13.3% less CUDA cores, RT cores and Tensor cores. It also comes with slower 2.45GHz boost clock speeds compared to 2.55GHz on the RTX 4080 Super. Notably, the RTX 5070 Ti comes with similar 16GB of VRAM, although it is upgraded to GDDR7, with faster memory speed and wider bandwidth. It also consumes 20W less than the RTX 4080 Super, which is all thanks to the efficiency of Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture.
Granted that the 5070 Ti comes with lesser CUDA, RT and Tensor cores compared to the 4080 Super, but it should make up for that with its faster and wider memory. On top of that, the new RTX-50 series GPUs benefit from DLSS 4 with multi frame generation and improved ray tracing with neural rendering.
We are currently in the process of testing the RTX 5070 Ti which means we don’t have a comprehensive comparison between the two GPUs. What we can tell you is that gaming performance is marginally slower compared to the RTX 4080 Super and in some cases offers similar framerate. Even in some of the synthetic benchmarks that we ran, both the cards offer similar looking scores.
This doesn’t come as a surprise as the RTX 5080 was only marginally faster than the 4080 Super. With future driver updates we could see a slight improvement in numbers, although that might not translate into a visible difference in terms of real world performance. Another point to consider is that the RTX 5070 Ti is able to deliver almost similar performance as the 4080 Super at a much lower power consumption. It may not be a huge victory, but it is an important one.
Like the RTX 5080, the new RTX 5070 Ti is not going to offer a huge uplift over its previous generation counterparts. It may be slightly better than the RTX 4070 Ti, but it is going to struggle to keep up with the RTX 4080 Super.
This is quite concerning especially since Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang claimed during the launch of the RTX 50-series that the non-Ti RTX 5070 would match the performance of an RTX 4090. At this moment, it is clear that one should steer away from what Nvidia wants you to believe. On top of that, stocks for the GPU are expected to be limited with prices going way beyond the suggested retail price of $750.
If you currently have an RTX 30-series card or older and are willing to pay close to $1,000, the RTX 5070 Ti should offer really good 1440p performance with improved ray tracing. If you are willing to switch sides, AMD is expected to launch its new Radeon RX 9070 series next month. By the looks of it, the company might just undercut Nvidia with its pricing, provided it offers enough stocks.
Despite not being a flagship graphics card, AMD's RX 9070 XT could be one of the most exciting graphics cards launches of the year. That's not hyperbole either. Following the disappointing results of the RTX 5080, and lack of availability of both RTX 50 and RTX 40-series graphics cards, there is serious hype around AMD's upcoming RX 9000 series.
But as excited as we are, that hype can only last as long as the card performs well. That's how well it performs in isolation, and against competitor cards like the RTX 5070 Ti -- another card riding the CES hype train ahead of its release.
 
The Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti is the next big graphics card launch for this new-generation of Blackwell GPUs. But despite early hyperbolic claims from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang about the new 50-series cards, disappointing results from the RTX 5080 suggest the 5070 Ti could fall well behind expectations.
The Nvidia RTX 5080 didn't blow the doors off our test rig when we put it through its paces, but it did show itself to be a very fast, modern GPU with a range of exciting features. But how much faster is it than its last-generation counterpart? And is it worth upgrading to if you're a generation behind?
If you'd rather just buy the best graphics card right now, we have a guide for that. But if you're curious how the RTX 5080 and 4080 Super match up, here's how.

58,2025-02-19,"There's a vast world of excellent apps outside of the Play Store. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.


Beyond the Alphabet is a weekly column that focuses on the tech world both inside and out of the confines of Mountain View.
Okay, the headline might be a little harsh, but I feel like the Play Store has evolved (or devolved) into one of those massive indoor flea markets with every square inch packed to the point that it's spilled out into the parking lot with people setting up tables.
To continue this random but apt analogy, you'll head over and see the same stores that have been there for years. You'll also see a few newcomers who are trying to fit in while offering a bunch of goodies for cheap. Then, there are those who don't fully understand the concept of a ""flea market"" and are there for all of the wrong reasons.
This is pretty much how the Play Store shakes out, with many of the usual suspects holding ground in the ""Top Charts."" Occasionally, a new app or game will slowly (or quickly) arrive with a lot of excitement before nestling in with the rest and bumping others out. Then, we have the nefarious apps. The ones that have a nice coat of paint, but are only there to either drain your Play Store balance or worse.
Thankfully, there are a few trusted Play Store alternatives that I've been enjoying to help make finding apps exciting again.

My first problem comes with actually finding apps. As of early February 2025, 42matters claims there are almost 2.1 million apps on the Play Store. Apparently, more than 1,100 new apps are published every day, with an average of almost 42,000 apps arriving every month. This brings me to my first issue with the Play Store — search.
How is it that a search engine can be so bad at search? Sure, it works fine if you know the name of the app that you're looking for. But try to search for ""KWGT"" or ""icon packs."" You'll get plenty of results, but there's no rhyme or reason for how the options are displayed. And it's not like you can just sort by ""recently updated"" or by the highest rating.
Of course, this problem really only surfaces when searching for more broad terms, but it's still something that drives me crazy. It also drives me crazy that, with some app listings, it's practically impossible to see the last time that it was updated.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android

Speaking of which, I can't tell you how many times I've gone to open and use an app, only to have to wait for it to be updated, despite the fact that it should have been updated overnight while my phone was charging and while I was asleep. No, it's not some game-breaking problem, but if I check the box for an app or my phone to do something, I expect it to be done.
Oh, and don't even get me started on games. One of the biggest reasons why I'm still subscribed to Play Pass is that it surfaces games that aren't just looking for ways to extract as much patience and money from me as possible. Which is exactly what most of the ""Top Charts"" consist of anymore. It's not entirely Google's fault, but both Apple and Google are a bit to blame here.

Wouldn't ya know, for the 2.1 million apps on the Play Store, there's a whole world of apps that are available. Many of which are FOSS or ""free and open source software,"" and are just a few taps away.
F-Droid is probably something you've heard of before, as it's essentially the Play Store for FOSS apps. The only ""catch"" is that you first need to sideload the F-Droid app or one of the clients like Neo Store and Droid-ify. And honestly, you'll probably want to try out Neo Store or Droid-ify because the F-Droid app itself looks rather archaic.

This is where my anti-Play Store journey began, as there really are a lot of fantastic open-source apps that don't get the recognition they deserve. Yes, there's a lot more digging and nuance involved, but in the end, it's well worth it.
But what if you're like me and have a curated list of open-source apps that you want to download and keep updated? Well, that's where Obtainium comes in.

I first learned about Obtainium early last year, as I was expanding my knowledge of retro gaming on Android handhelds. See, there are a decent number of recommended and reliable emulators on the Play Store, but there are even more that aren't. At the time, this was before Nintendo wrecked Switch emulation, so Obtainium made it easy to keep Yuzu and its forks updated.
With Obtainium, you're able to bypass F-Droid or the Play Store and get apps and updates directly from the source. However, there are ""over a dozen source websites, including GitHub, GitLab, and F-Droid.""
The process of adding apps can still be tedious, especially if the majority of them come from GitHub and you end up bumping up against the rate limit. That can be solved by signing up for a GitHub and/or GitLab account and generating a Personal Access Token that is added to Obtainium.
However, there's also a solution to being able to keep the list of apps across devices, without needing to manually add them every time. Obtainium lets you export the list of apps that you've curated, complete with any specific information that you've added such as the name or category. So as long as you keep the exported JSON file backed up, you can just download Obtainium and import the list when you get a new Android device.

The fun doesn't stop there, however, as you can also add things and set them to ""Track-Only."" With this, you'll be notified when there's a new release, but it's not actually an app that can be downloaded. I use this to keep track of when new drivers are released, along with tracking multiple forks of the same app.
Because I've been getting more and more open-source apps, and not just the ones on Android, I've also started using GitHub more and more. So, when I learned that I could create a repo and upload my exported list of apps, I got pretty excited.
This way, I don't have to try to remember what cloud storage service I uploaded it to while keeping my ""open source world"" tied together quite nicely. Plus, there are a bunch of ""crowdsourced app configurations"" that can be added with just a couple of taps.
Look, I know that this isn't a path that many will venture down, and it's okay if you don't really have issues with the Play Store. But if you're like me and want something better, and that gives you more control, definitely check out Obtainium.

EXCLUSIVE: With cozy crime still red hot, French drama Curious By Nature is launching internationally.

	The series follows Fred, a seasoned war reporter with a fiery temper, played by César Award-nominated Florence Pernel (Three Colours: Blue).

	Fred is now working in local news. When her assignments lead her to uncover criminal cases that have been swept under the rug, she is compelled to dig deeper. Accompanied by her clumsy cameraman Manu (Jean-Baptiste Shelmerdine), colorful investigations ensue.

France TV Distribution is giving the series, which runs to three 90-minute instalments, a MIP London launch. In France it is known as Enquête Parallèle and plays on pubcaster France Télévisions’ France 3 channel.

	The cast also includes Jessyrielle Massengo, Macha Méril and Frédérique Tirmont. Stéphanie Pillonca and Christophe Paturange direct from Armelle Patron and Emmanuel Patron’s scripts. Brain Productions makes the series.

Curious By Nature will be part of France TV Distribution’s slate as it readies for the London Screenings and MIP London, alongside shows including Annwyn, The Otherworld and Sea Shadows. The sales house will have a presence at the inaugural MIP event in the English capital, as well as the city’s TV Screenings, during which it will host a presentation at the Charlotte Street Hotel.

Curious By Nature rolls out as demand for crime programming remains robust. France has a strong pedigree in the cozy crime sub-genre, which is often referred to as “light crime” by the French distributors. Series such as Tom and Lola and HPI have proved popular. The latter has been adapted for U.S. TV, with High Potential airing on the ABC network.

60,2025-02-19,"In recent years, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) has become a key focus for global corporations.
However, as societal and political pressures intensify under President Donald Trump, companies including Walmart, McDonald’s, and others are reevaluating their DEI strategies. While some, such as Costco, are holding firm, Google, Meta, and Zoom (ZM-0.25%), for example, are scaling back. This presents both challenges and opportunities as Corporate America tries to adapt to evolving market and regulatory realities.
“DEI is in the crosshairs because of poor execution and identity politics,” said TaChelle Lawson, founder  of Fig Strategy & Consulting. “However, it is evolving.” Lawson believes that companies are either overcommitting or retreating altogether – both of which are problematic.
After the murder of George Floyd in 2020, many companies made sweeping DEI commitments. For example, Target (TGT+0.43%) promised a 20% increase in its Black workforce over three years. However, Target recently scrapped its DEI goals and stopped reporting to external groups such as the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index. The company also ended its program to stock more products from Black or minority-owned businesses. Earlier this month, Target’s shareholders sued the company, accusing it of deceiving investors by not disclosing risks associated with its diversity program.
This undoing of DEI programs comes amid broader corporate and political shifts, particularly following the Supreme Court’s ruling against affirmative action and increased scrutiny of corporate diversity efforts. The pressure increased with Trump’s executive order to challenge federal-level DEI programs. 
It seems the legal battle over DEI has begun. In a recent lawsuit filed by Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey against Starbucks, the company is accused of prioritizing the hiring of women and people of color over qualifications. “Starbucks (SBUX-0.46%)’ U.S. workforce was 70.9% women and 28.4% men [...] In other words, since 2020, Starbucks’ [workforce] has become more female and less white,” reads page 29 of the lawsuit.
Noa Gafni, a faculty member at Columbia University, told Quartz in an interview that, while these efforts were well-intentioned, companies lacked the strategies needed to create lasting change. “DEI [became] a priority over night,” she said. “But the lack of comprehensive plans led to frustration.” 
Five years later, Gafni suggests companies now have an opportunity to re-think their DEI efforts in a more sustainable way. She recommends aligning DEI initiatives with core business goals, driving cultural change through middle management, and building cross-country partnerships to tackle systemic issues. “A diverse workforce that is engaged and heard will lead to innovation and growth,” Gafni added. 
As companies upend their DEI programs, Lawson from Fig believes metrics  will shift to avoid legal and reputational risks. “Hiring quotas will be eliminated, ERGs will be scaled back, and diversity training will become less mandatory,” she predicted. The focus will move way from visible diversity metrics toward internal assessments of culture and inclusion. 
Despite these shifts, DEI remains a top priority for many employees and consumers. According to data from market research firm Reputation Leaders, 63% of Americans consider DEI policies important for U.S. companies in 2025, reinforcing its continued significance. 
“The key is always planning ahead and thinking about how changes will be received,” said Gafni. She stresses the importance of anticipating backlash from stakeholders, whether that’s shareholders, employees, or external political groups. 
“Transparent communications are key to a healthy, diverse corporate culture,” Gafni explained.” Companies that thoughtfully approach DEI will be better positioned to lead in the years ahead.

61,2025-02-19,"Trump’s 10% tariff on all imports from China – payable in addition to any existing duties – is now in effect, and is starting to be reflected in US prices.
The tariff is paid by US businesses and consumers when goods arrive from China, with companies forced to choose between passing it on to consumers in the form of higher prices, or absorbing the costs and taking a hit to their profit margin … 
The Telegraph (via Engadget) notes that Acer is one of the first companies to announce its decision, choosing to pass on the tariff to customers.
The boss of one of the world’s biggest computer makers has said he is putting prices up by 10pc as a direct result of Donald Trump’s tariffs. Jason Chen, the chief executive and chairman of Acer, said the US price increase on laptops made in China would happen “by default” and apply from next month […]
“We will have to adjust the end user price to reflect the tariff,” Mr Chen said. “We think 10pc probably will be the default price increase because of the import tax. It’s very straightforward.”
During the campaign, Trump claimed that prices would not be affected by the tariff, but following his election admitted that prices “could go up.”
If you’re planning a sizeable purchase of anything made in China, now could be a good time to buy. While the tariffs are now in effect, many companies will still have US stock imported last month which they can sell at existing prices without impacting their bottom-line.
The paper reports that almost 80% of laptops sold in the US are made in China, with the trade body for consumer electronics goods predicting an expensive hit.
The Consumer Technology Association (CTA), the trade body for the electronics industry, has said that tariffs could cost American consumers up to $143bn and lead to a slump in sales.
Apple is a Core Member of the CTA.
Acer says it’s considering moving some production out of China, but the hurdles to doing this are substantial. The company also mentioned the possibility of doing some manufacturing in the US, but that’s likely merely a diplomatic murmuring given that a separate Trump tariff would impose an import tax on components of up to 100%.
Apple has so far left its prices unchanged, but it too will have to choose between raising US prices or accepting a reduced profit margin on US sales.

We’ve talked about LG’s fancy StanbyME monitor beforeâthe battery powered display that you can easily take around with you anywhere in your home. Well, LG also has a portable version you can take around with you anywhereÂ outside of your home. The LG StanbyME Go is a 27-inch portable smart touch screen that folds up into a briefcase. It feels like something out of a sci-fi movie made before tablets became a thing. Right now, it’s part of a limited time deal which has cut a chunky 42% off the price. It’s normally going for $1,197, but after that discount, you’ll only pay $697. That amounts to a savings of $500.
See at Amazon
I’m kind of in awe at this thing’s existence. It only has about three hours of battery lifeâenough to watch one long movie or maybe a few episodes of a show. Though maybe that’s all you need. Most tablets can grant you way more watch time than that, but the quality of the LG StanbyME is nothing to sneeze at.
The LG StandbyME Go is a full 27-inches in size which is significantly larger than any tablet you’ll find on the market. The screen is 1080p, plus it supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos for extraordinary color, contrast, and brightness and powerful sound. It’s like your own personal cinema inside of a briefcase.
The portable monitor is Wi-Fi enabled and runs on a proprietary LG webOS with its touch interface. Through it, you’ll be able to access over 300 LG channels along with all your favorite streaming apps like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney Plus, and Apple TV.
The screen is adjustable as the attachment to the briefcase can be maneuvered into place for optimal viewing. It can even be rotated to portrait so you can watch vertical videos.
It goes without mentioning how portable this thing it. It literally folds up into a briefcase. It is worth highlighting the hard case and padded interior. Your screen is more than protected when inside of the the case which is 26.4 inches across, 17 inches tall, and 4.6 inches thick. Also inside of the case, you’ll find the remote for volume and channel controls along with navigating the main interface.
For a limited time, the LG 27-Inch StanbyME Go portable touchscreen has been discounted down by $500. This 42% discount will let you own this cinema in a briefcase for the low price of just $797.

AWS, AMD, and Google lose wafer share.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Over the past few years, we have seen a lot of AI-market-related metrics, starting from petaflops of performance and going all the way up to gigawatts of power consumption. A rather unexpected metric is perhaps the one from Morgan Stanley (via @Jukanlosreve) that counts the wafer consumption of AI processors. There are no surprises, though: Nvidia controls the lion's share of wafers designated for AI and is set to increase its domination in 2025 as it chews through up to 77% of the world's supply of wafers destined for AI applications. 
While Nvidia is operating at an unprecedented scale and continues ramping up production dramatically, AMD's share of AI wafer usage will actually decline next year. The figures also cover other industry heavyweights like AWS, Google, Tesla, Microsoft, and Chinese vendors.
Morgan Stanley’s analysis is the best in the industry. It’s data you won’t find anywhere else… pic.twitter.com/FhGwaf2Ux6February 8, 2025
If you expand the above tweet, you can see that Morgan Stanley predicts that  Nvidia will dominate AI semiconductor wafer consumption in 2025, increasing its share from 51% in 2024 to 77% in 2025 while consuming 535,000 300-mm wafers. 
AI-specific processors, such as Google TPU v6 and AWS Trainium, are gaining traction but remain far behind Nvidia's GPUs. As such, AWS's share is set to fall from 10% to 7%, while Google's share is projected to fall from 19% to 10%. Google allocates 85,000 wafers to TPU v6, while AWS dedicates 30,000 to Trainium 2 and 16,000 to Trainium 3, according to Morgan Stanley's projections. 
As for AMD, its share is expected to drop from 9% to 3% as its MI300, MI325, and MI355 GPUs — the company's main offerings —  have wafer allocations ranging from 5,000 to 25,000 wafers. Notably, this doesn't mean that AMD will consume fewer wafers next year, just that its percentage of the overall share will decline.  
Intel's Gaudi 3 processors (named Habana in the graph) will remain around 1%. 
Tesla, Microsoft, and Chinese vendors hold minimal shares. This may not be a problem, though. Tesla's Dojo and FSD processors have limited wafer demand, which reflects their niche role in AI computing. Microsoft's Maia 200 and its enhanced version have similarly small wafer allocations because these chips remain secondary for the company as it continues to use Nvidia's GPUs for training and inference.

What the published graph does not indicate is whether Nvidia's dominance stems from the massive demand expected in 2025 or the fact that the company booked more TSMC logic and TSMC CoWoS capacity than everyone else. 
The total AI market is projected to reach 688,000 wafers, and the estimated value is said to be $14.57 billion. This projection could be an underestimation, though. TSMC earned $64.93 billion in 2024, and 51% (over $32 billion) of it came from segments that the foundry calls high-performance computing (HPC). Technically, HPC includes everything from AI GPUs to processors for client PCs (smartphones are another category, and it accounted for 35% of TSMC's revenue in 2024) to game consoles. However, AI GPUs and data center CPUs account for a lion's share of that HPC revenue of $32 billion. 
The largest contributor to the growth of the wafers consumed by AI processors is Nvidia's B200 GPU, which is expected to require 220,000 wafers, generating $5.84 billion in revenue, according to Morgan Stanley projections. Other Nvidia GPUs for AI, including the H100, H200, and B300, add to its dominance. All of these products use TSMC's 4nm-class process technologies, and their compute die sizes range from 814 mm^2 to 850 mm^2, which explains the vast wafer demand.

	The scores for Italian horror films, from giallos to zombie movies, have in recent years become a cornerstone of the vinyl reissue market. Not a month goes by when collectors can’t acquire a new copy of the soundtrack to “Suspiria,” “Zombi 2,” “Nightmare City” or dozens of other terrifying titles. The music for Italian comedies, meanwhile, largely continues to languish in obscurity — at least until now.

	Writer-director Eli Roth, lover of genre films (and their soundtracks), has partnered with CAM Sugar, one of Italy’s most storied record labels, on a compilation of cues from from the heyday of the “commedia sexy all’italiana,” or sexy Italian comedy. Due March 21, “Eli Roth’s Red Light Disco: Dancefloor Seduction From Italian Sexploitation Cinema” features 20 tracks handpicked by Roth from the label’s expansive 2,000-title deep library of film music. Assembled on vinyl, CD and via digital platforms, the release marks the first time many of these tracks have even been heard outside of their respective films.

	“When I first heard the music of the Italian genre films of the 1970s, these tracks were impossible to find outside of the films themselves,” says Roth in the set’s liner notes. “When CAM Sugar Music asked me to curate this collection, it was not only a thrill for me as a film fan, it was a dream as a director too, because they opened the archive to thousands and thousands of previously unreleased tracks.”




			Popular on Variety		






	Although the films may not be readily familiar even to dedicated genre fans, the composers of their music certainly will be: tracks appear by the likes of Stelvio Cipriani, Bruno Nicolai, Riz Ortolani, Franco Campanino, Gianni Ferrio, Nico Fidenco and Daniele Patucchi. To provide vital context for the selected music, Roth wrote extensive essays and conducted interviews, including with European genre legend Edwige Fenech (“The Case of the Bloody Iris”) and the granddaughter of Bombolo, one of the male superstars of the “commedia sexy all’italiana” films, and Campanino, composer of the music to “To Be Twenty,” one of Roth’s favorite Italian films.

	“Eli Roth’s Red Light Disco” will be released in multiple formats: a standard version on either 2LP black vinyl or CD, and a deluxe limited deluxe edition pressed on red vinyl featuring a special mirrored cover and a bonus a 7” single with two rare cuts, one unreleased and one previously unissued on vinyl, along with a poster and a set of postcards with previously unseen photographs from Italian sexy comedy film sets. All versions of the album include the 28-page booklet featuring “Eli Roth’s Guide to Italian Red Light Cinema.” All of the audio has been restored and remastered from the original sources, to meet the presentation standards of contemporary audiophiles.

	










	Although CAM Sugar has licensed its music for reissues in the past — notably Decca’s compilation “Paura: A Collection of Italian Horror Sounds From the CAM Sugar Archives” — this set curated by Roth marks a new partnership with the label to uncover and re-release more music from its library. It encompasses a catalog that began in 1959 when the label was founded, and extends to today.

69,2025-02-19,"Apple CEO Tim Cook has confirmed that Apple will launch a new product today, Wednesday, February 19. The most likely release is the much-anticipated iPhone SE 4, but there are a few other possibilities. Here’s everything you need to know.
The iPhone SE 4 has been rumored for over two years, and it’s going to be a massive upgrade to Apple’s most affordable iPhone model. The revamp will include an all-new design inspired by the iPhone 14, along with major internal performance improvements and an upgraded camera.
According to Bloomberg, the iPhone SE 4 is almost certainly the product Apple will announce on Wednesday. I’m pretty excited to see this thing actually hit the market, and I think it has a shot at being a big success if Apple gets the pricing right.
The M4 MacBook Air will offer a handful of upgrades over the M3 version. The big change, of course, will be the faster performance and better efficiency offered by the M4 chip. Perhaps most notably, this should lead to an increase in battery life as well. 
The M4 chip will also unlock a higher top RAM configuration of 32GB for the MacBook Air. For comparison, the M3 MacBook Air tops out at 24GB. 
Another big change: the M4 MacBook Air will support two external displays even when its lid is open. Currently, the M3 MacBook Air only supports two external displays when its lid is closed. 
The M4 MacBook Air is expected to launch soon, with supply dwindling at Apple retail stores. Whether or not that happens this week or later this spring remains to be seen.
Apple is working on two updates to the iPad lineup. First, there’s the iPad 11, a new model of its most affordable iPad. The iPad 11 will feature faster performance with Apple’s A17 Pro chip paired with 8GB of RAM. That’s a significant boost from the iPad 10, which is powered by the A14 Bionic chip and 4GB of RAM. These upgrades will enable Apple Intelligence support on Apple’s cheapest iPad. 
Additionally, Apple is working on a new version of the iPad Air. This will just be a basic spec bump update, with a performance boost from the M2 chip to the M3 chip.
There’s a brand new product expected to join Apple’s lineup this year. As 9to5Mac reported last September, Apple is working on a new smart home command center with a square display and an A18 chip for Apple Intelligence support. 
Bloomberg has also extensively reported on this product. According to Mark Gurman, the device will feature a 7-inch display and be “about the size of two iPhones side by side, with a thick edge around the display.” 
The device’s design is centered around being attached to a wall and will be available in silver and black color options. Bloomberg also reports that there will be “bases with additional speakers that can be placed in the kitchen, on a nightstand or on a desk.” 
While Apple was initially targeting a March release for the new smart display product, more recent reporting suggests the device will ship later than anticipated. 
Last but not least, we’re still waiting for Apple to release the next round of software betas for all of its platforms. iOS 18.4 is expected to bring multiple new Apple Intelligence features, including Siri with personal context, on-screen awareness, and in-app actions.
Bloomberg reports that the first iOS 18.4 beta will be released as soon as sometime this week. In addition to iOS 18.4, Apple will likely release iPadOS 18.4, macOS 15.4, tvOS 18.4, and watchOS 11.4.
I’d bet on this week focusing on the new iPhone SE 4. This is a hotly-anticipated addition to Apple’s product lineup that will put Apple Intelligence at a much lower price point. Most 9to5Mac readers who care about the latest and greatest hardware might think it’s a boring announcement, but it’s a key market for Apple.
Based on last year’s schedule, we’re overdue for the release of the first iOS 18.4 beta. Whether or not that materializes this week remains to be seen.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

It just wouldn't be a day in the games industry without some dispiriting news about layoffs, would it? This time the company cutting back on staff is Liquid Swords, the studio founded by Christofer Sundberg, formerly Chief Creative Officer at Avalanche Studios and creator of the Just Cause series.
In a statement (via Game Developer), Sundberg explained that Liquid Swords was founded in 2020 with the intent ""to build a studio redefining game development with a small, expert-driven team and a sustainable work model."" Yet while he claims the company achieved ""much"" of this goal, ""shifting market conditions prevented us from succeeding in our timeframe."" Consequently, Liquid Swords has made the ""incredibly difficult"" decision to ""part ways with talented individuals who have been instrumental in our journey.""
If you aren't familiar with Liquid Swords, that's likely because the studio's first game is still in development. At the time the studio's creation was announced, it explained it would be ""focused on open world action, explosions, shareable experiences and memorable game moments"". Its website pronounces the studio ""prioritises creativity over crunch"", and that its current project is a ""narrative-driven, open-world, hardboiled AAA revenge story"" made in Unreal Engine 5. This project will apparently continue despite the layoffs, with Sundberg stating it will remain ""committed to our vision and will continue to work on our IP.""
While layoffs are sadly rife in the games industry at present, the downsizing of Liquid Swords is a little surprising. In 2022, NetEase games invested an undisclosed amount into the studio, with Liquid Swords planning to build up its studio to 100 employees by early 2024.
Christofer Sundberg spent more than a decade with Avalanche before founding Liquid Swords, working on the Just Cause games as well as 2015's underrated Mad Max tie-in. Last year, Sundberg came out swinging in Mad Max's defence after the game was criticised by the series' creator George Miller, describing Miller's comments as ""complete arrogance"" and stating Warner Bros ""did everything they could they could to make this a complete linear game after having signed up with a developer of open world games."" Moreover, he claimed Avalanche was ""forced to release"" the game on the same day as Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain and that Warner Bros ""blamed us for the bad sales and canceled a bunch of awesome DLC.""

    At a surprising time, Apple unveiled a new phone with Apple Intelligence and Apple's first in-house 5G modem. Here are the main features and specs.
  
A new iPhone in February?! Apple launched the iPhone 16E on its site Wednesday, expanding the iPhone 16 line while also bringing a much-needed overhaul to the 2022 iPhone SE with an all-new name, design, processor and Apple Intelligence features.
The iPhone 16E starts at $599 (£599, AU$999), which is $170 more than the previous SE's $429 starting price. By contrast, the regular iPhone 16 starts at $799. The price puts the phone towards the higher end of the affordable phone market, between rivals like the $499 Google Pixel 8A and Samsung's Galaxy S24 FE, which starts at $650.
At a time when phone-makers have bet their success on implementing custom artificial intelligence features into their devices faster than their rivals, Apple makes it clear that its AI isn't limited to its expensive flagship devices. Powering the iPhone 16E is Apple's A18 chip (the same one found in the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus) so it can run Apple Intelligence. This makes the new Apple phone a rarity: a sub-$600 device that can run the same AI features as its more expensive siblings.
Otherwise, the iPhone 16E has a curious value proposition. On paper it seems like an upgrade in nearly every way to the iPhone SE. But it lacks the iPhone SE's main appeals: a low price and a small design. That's not to say that the iPhone 16E isn't worth its $600 starting price, which will no doubt be lower with carrier deals and discounts at launch. But like the old iPhone SE, you have to wonder how long will this phone be relevant for? 
The iPhone 16E will be available to preorder this Friday, Feb. 21, and will go on sale on Friday, Feb. 28.
The iPhone 16E has an Action button that can trigger a shortcut or start a Visual Intelligence search.
The iPhone 16E's design is based on the iPhone 14's aluminum body. The back glass is matte, which should help keep fingerprints from accumulating. In lieu of a mute switch, there's an Action button for activating a shortcut. Since the iPhone 16E lacks a Camera Control button, you'll be able to trigger Visual Intelligence searches with the Action button. The phone has a USB-C port for charging (instead of the iPhone 14's Lightning port).
The iPhone 16E marks the end of Apple selling a phone with a home button, which defined the first decade of iPhone designs, dating back to the original one. The iPhone 16E also has a 6.1-inch screen, which means that Apple no longer sells a truly small iPhone option. But the screen, locked at a 60Hz refresh rate, seems like a miss by Apple when the majority of budget Android handsets sport high refresh-rate displays starting at 90Hz. Also, note that the iPhone 16E has a screen notch and lacks a Dynamic Island cutout. 
Oddly the iPhone 16E doesn't come in a color: only black or white.
The original iPhone SE launched in 2016 and its design was based on the iPhone 5S. SE stood for ""special edition,"" though over the years some of us have referred to it as ""small edition."" In 2020, Apple launched the second-generation iPhone SE with a design based on the iPhone 8 but with the A13 Bionic processor from the iPhone 11 series. In 2022, the third-generation iPhone SE launched. Its design was largely similar to the 2020 version but had the A15 Bionic chip from the iPhone 13 series.
The iPhone 16E supports Apple Intelligence, including fun features like GenMoji.
The iPhone 16E also has something no other iPhone has: an Apple-designed 5G modem. It's called the C1 chip, and in a launch video on Apple's site, the company claims that it is the ""most power-efficient modem ever in an iPhone.""
The C1 modem supports 5G, but not the fast millimeter-wave 5G found in places like stadiums. It will be interesting testing phone calls and data speeds once we get our hands on the iPhone 16E.
Apple also says that the combination of the A18 and C1 chip raises the efficiency and adds up to a longer battery life. There are two ways for a phone-maker to gain customers: lower a phone's price and lengthen its battery life. While Apple didn't give us a lower price than the SE, its battery life might be the best feature. Again, I look forward to testing the 16E.
The new iPhone also lacks support for MagSafe charging and accessories. No MagSafe is a bit of a bummer, since that means you can't use magnetic accessories and can only wirelessly charge the phone at a slow 7.5-watt speed. (It can charge wired at 20 watts, though.)
The rear has a single 48-megapixel camera.
The iPhone 16E sports a single rear camera with a 48-megapixel sensor. While you don't get even an ultrawide option, the main camera has a high enough resolution to do sensor cropping to offer a 2x magnification – not quite the same as having a second camera, but possibly close.
Around the front is a 12-megapixel camera that supports Face ID and has autofocus for selfies.
In one sense the iPhone 16E carries the mantle of the SE series and how Apple uses parts of old iPhones to create an affordable one. But that name change also represents a symbolic change from Apple having a cheap phone to Apple having an affordable iPhone 16 -- much like how Samsung has its Galaxy FE models.
With the name change to iPhone 16E, it will be curious to see how Apple handles upgrades. As opposed to the multiple years between iPhone SE releases, will this be a phone that Apple updates yearly? Will there be an iPhone 17E? All this remains to be seen. I am excited to test the iPhone 16E, so keep an eye out for more coverage on the phone at CNET and our review coming soon."

From the MBA: Mortgage Applications Decrease in Latest MBA Weekly SurveyMortgage applications decreased 6.6 percent from one 
week earlier, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) Weekly Mortgage 
Applications Survey for the week ending February 14, 2025.

The Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, decreased 6.6 percent on 
a seasonally adjusted basis from one week earlier. On an unadjusted basis, the Index decreased 4
percent compared with the previous week. The Refinance Index decreased 7 percent from the previous 
week and was 39 percent higher than the same week one year ago. The seasonally adjusted Purchase 
Index decreased 6 percent from one week earlier. The unadjusted Purchase Index decreased 1 percent
compared with the previous week and was 7 percent higher than the same week one year ago.

“Mortgage rates decreased on average over the week, as markets brushed off unexpectedly strong 
inflation data. Despite mortgage rates declining, with the 30-year fixed mortgage rate dropping to 6.93 
percent, mortgage applications decreased to their slowest pace since the beginning of the year,” said Joel 
Kan, MBA’s Vice President and Deputy Chief Economist. “Purchase applications were down for the week, 
as buyers remained on the fence, although loosening inventory may help support activity in the coming 
months. Refinance applications had been rising in previous weeks but dipped as rates remained close to 
7 percent.”
...
The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances 
($766,550 or less) decreased to 6.93 percent from 6.95 percent, with points increasing to 0.66 from 0.64
(including the origination fee) for 80 percent loan-to-value ratio (LTV) loans.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Two years after the Sony WF-C700N were released, and topped our list of the best budget wireless earbuds at the time, the electronics manufacturer looks set to do it again.
The Walkman Blog has obtained leaked photos of the WF-C710N earbuds, alongside a host of specifications and guidance on price and a release window, seemingly provided by “a well trusted source”.
This follows a previous design leak via a Taiwanese certification body in January, but there are plenty more details this time around.
The earbuds are shown in four different colors – black, white, pink, and a pleasingly retro transparent blue that shows the bud’s inner workings – alongside a companion charging case.
The WF-C710N earbuds share its predecessor’s 5mm drivers, IPX4 water resistance, and support for ANC, with a couple of notable changes.
For one, there’s now a dual microphone setup for more advanced noise cancellation, and a proximity sensor hopefully means they'll offer wear detection, which the previous model lacked. Bluetooth 5.3 is also included, up from Bluetooth 5.2 in the last model.
Battery life will be slightly changed too, with the buds reaching 8.5 hours with ANC activated and 12 hours total through the charging case, rather than the 7.5 hours from the buds and 15 hours total through the charging case of the previous model. That's an improvement in one direction, but a step back in the other – perhaps we'll be pleasantly surprised and will find out the total battery life is better than it looks.
Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.
The Walkman Blog predicts a late May release window, at an RRP of $110-120, around the same price as the previous model.

In our WF-C700N review, TechRadar’s Audio Editor Becky Scarrott wrote that “Sony has taken everything I loved about its more expensive earbuds and squirrelled it into smaller earbuds, at a lower price. You don't get lossless LDAC or the firm's top-tier DSEE upscaler, but for this money, the audio quality cannot currently be beaten.”
While there are better headphones out there, this line of earbuds are pretty much perfect for their near-$100 price, and it’s exciting to see Sony build on that success with a new model. It does seem like an iterative upgrade, rather than a transformative change, but if it keeps the WF-C710N earbuds affordable, we’ve got little to complain about.
Let’s just hope we get some of the more interesting colors of the WF-C700N, like lavender or sage green, down the line.

Overwatch 2's Season 16 began last night, and with it came a load of new features like perks and loot boxes, changes to the UI, and a rank reset. It's a big update for the start of the season, but one that was very much needed thanks to the new competition that Marvel Rivals has brought.
""We're obviously in a new competitive landscape that I think, for Overwatch, we've never really been in before, to this extent where there's another game that's so similar to the one that we've created,"" game director Aaron Keller says in an interview with GamesRadar.
""There's actually something kind of exciting about this for a few reasons."" Keller goes on to explain that this new competitive ecosystem is actually the kick up the butt that the Overwatch 2 team needed: ""This is no longer about playing it safe. And I really think that seasons 15 and 16 are us not playing it safe. But really, it's a forcing function to execute—and for a team of super passionate craftspeople, that's like music to their ears.""
Watching the Overwatch 2 Spotlight, I was pleasantly surprised to see just how much the developers had in store for the game, but I was even more astounded to see that perks, one of the biggest fundamental changes to the game we've seen since Overwatch 2's launch, were going to be added straight away into casual and competitive play. Usually, whenever the developers have a new idea, feature, or hero, it'll get tested over a weekend or in an arcade mode before it gets placed into the main game, but not this time. For perks, the developers are diving headfirst into it.
""There's a little bit of letting go of the fine balance that we've been chasing and see how it all plays out to some degree,"" lead gameplay designer Alec Dawson said during a roundtable interview. ""We should be a little scared of what we're putting out there in terms of how it might affect the game. Within reason, of course."" It's nice to see Overwatch 2 loosen up a bit when it comes to new features, especially since Marvel Rivals has been so flexible with adding new heroes and abilities to the game.
""I look at what happens in a game of Overwatch, and a lot of times, when you get enough hours in the game, it almost feels like you can be going through the motions,"" Keller says. ""What we want to be able to do is to inject a bit of freshness into the game, but not just for variety's sake. We want to increase the depth of play.""
Perks have definitely shaken things up a bit—I was excited to start the competitive season alongside these new features, and while the change isn't astronomical, it's just the right amount to make fights a little more interesting and change heroes up a bit.
Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.
During the first 10 competitive matches of the new season, I got to see pretty much everything that these perks have to offer, and while most of the new features are quite moderate, there were a few surprises. There were some nightmare moments in which a hero I was fighting against pulled something truly outrageous out of thin air, like Reaper's new Dire Triggers perk that lets him fire a long-range shot from his shotguns, or Pharah's Drift Thrusters perk that lets her move while using her ultimate. The last thing I shouted before getting a face full of mini-rockets was, ""She can move?!""

Like most new seasons, there's also a meta emerging early on, but this time, it's influenced more by perks than buffs or nerfs. I've seen a lot of Orisa's so far, as her Fleeting Bulwark perk grants her an additional 100 overhealth, and her Protective Barrier switches out the Javelin Spin ability for her old energy shield, meaning she's now a very powerful defensive tank. Reaper is also a lot more lethal thanks to his perks, which grant him extra health and better range on his shotgun, making him a serious close combat threat and now fairly competent at longer-range fights.
Blizzard will definitely need to make some tweaks to perks post-launch, but I'm very happy to make the trade-off of having slightly busted heroes for a short while so we can have such a great new feature so quickly.
There's also a new UI overhaul, which has cleaned up players' profiles, and made the Play page nicer to look at, as well as adding loot boxes, which you can snag in the premium battle pass or get for free by completing challenges or just in the weekly rewards. There's a lot to appreciate at the start of this new season, and while Overwatch 2 may have been very slow off the mark to institute substantial changes like this and the upcoming Stadium mode, I'm not holding it against them—I'm just happy these changes are here.

78,2025-02-19,"Wintermute, one of the largest liquidity providers in the cryptocurrency market, is expanding into the U.S. with the opening of a new office in New York and the introduction of over-the-counter (OTC) trading products in the country.
Wintermute has plans for a “new added focus on the U.S.,” CEO Evgeny Gaevoy told Bloomberg during Consensus Hong Kong 2025.
“We are looking to expand in the U.S. with our OTC offering, and we are looking to expand in the U.S. with derivatives offering as well on the OTC side,” Gaevoy said.
The company, which has offices in London and Singapore and employs more than 100 people, is being driven by optimism on potential regulatory changes in the U.S. under the administration of President Donald Trump. 
It's not alone. Other crypto firms now considering U.S. expansion or shares sales to the public include Blockchain.com, Circle, Kraken, Gemini Ripple and BitGo. Bullish Global, the parent of CoinDesk, is also said to be considering an IPO.
The New York office is set to open later this year, with an initial team of between five and 10 employees. Gaevoy said Wintermute won’t be conducting trading activities out of the new office.

79,2025-02-19," By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:  
     Section 1.  Policy and Purpose.  The Constitution vests all executive power in the President and charges him with faithfully executing the laws.  Since it would be impossible for the President to single-handedly perform all the executive business of the Federal Government, the Constitution also provides for subordinate officers to assist the President in his executive duties.  In the exercise of their often-considerable authority, these executive branch officials remain subject to the President’s ongoing supervision and control.  The President in turn is regularly elected by and accountable to the American people.  This is one of the structural safeguards, along with the separation of powers between the executive and legislative branches, regular elections for the Congress, and an independent judiciary whose judges are appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, by which the Framers created a Government accountable to the American people.   
     However, previous administrations have allowed so-called “independent regulatory agencies” to operate with minimal Presidential supervision.  These regulatory agencies currently exercise substantial executive authority without sufficient accountability to the President, and through him, to the American people.  Moreover, these regulatory agencies have been permitted to promulgate significant regulations without review by the President.  
     These practices undermine such regulatory agencies’ accountability to the American people and prevent a unified and coherent execution of Federal law.  For the Federal Government to be truly accountable to the American people, officials who wield vast executive power must be supervised and controlled by the people’s elected President.   
     Therefore, in order to improve the administration of the executive branch and to increase regulatory officials’ accountability to the American people, it shall be the policy of the executive branch to ensure Presidential supervision and control of the entire executive branch.  Moreover, all executive departments and agencies, including so-called independent agencies, shall submit for review all proposed and final significant regulatory actions to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Executive Office of the President before publication in the Federal Register. 
     Sec. 2.  Definitions.  For the purposes of this order:
     (a)  The term “employees” shall have the meaning given that term in section 2105 of title 5, United States Code.   
     (b)  The term “independent regulatory agency” shall have the meaning given that term in section 3502(5) of title 44, United States Code.  This order shall not apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to the Federal Open Market Committee in its conduct of monetary policy.  This order shall apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System only in connection with its conduct and authorities directly related to its supervision and regulation of financial institutions.  
     (c)  The term “independent regulatory agency chairman” shall mean, with regard to a multi-member independent regulatory agency, the chairman of such agency, and shall mean, with regard to a single-headed independent regulatory agency, such agency’s chairman, director, or other presiding officer.    
     (d)  The term “head” of an independent regulatory agency shall mean those appointed to supervise independent regulatory agencies and in whom the agencies’ authorities are generally vested, encompassing the chairman, director, or other presiding officer, and, as applicable, other members, commissioners, or similar such officials with responsibility for supervising such agencies.   
     Sec. 3.  OIRA Review of Agency Regulations.  (a)  Section 3(b) of Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1993 (“Regulatory Planning and Review”), as amended, is hereby amended to read as follows:   
     “(b)  “Agency,” unless otherwise indicated, means any authority of the United States that is an “agency” under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1), and shall also include the Federal Election Commission.  This order shall not apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or to the Federal Open Market Committee in its conduct of monetary policy.  This order shall apply to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System only in connection with its conduct and authorities directly related to its supervision and regulation of financial institutions.”.
     (b)  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall provide guidance on implementation of this order to the heads of executive departments and agencies newly submitting regulatory actions under section 3(b) of Executive Order 12866.  Agency submissions by independent regulatory agencies under such section shall commence within the earlier of 60 days from the date of this order, or completion of such implementation guidance.  
     Sec. 4.  Performance Standards and Management Objectives.  The Director of OMB shall establish performance standards and management objectives for independent agency heads, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, and report periodically to the President on their performance and efficiency in attaining such standards and objectives. 
     Sec. 5.  Apportionments for Independent Regulatory Agencies.  The Director of OMB shall, on an ongoing basis:   
     (a)  review independent regulatory agencies’ obligations for consistency with the President’s policies and priorities; and   
     (b)  consult with independent regulatory agency chairmen and adjust such agencies’ apportionments by activity, function, project, or object, as necessary and appropriate, to advance the President’s policies and priorities.  Such adjustments to apportionments may prohibit independent regulatory agencies from expending appropriations on particular activities, functions, projects, or objects, so long as such restrictions are consistent with law. 
     Sec. 6.  Additional Consultation with the Executive Office of the President.  (a)  Subject to subsection (b), independent regulatory agency chairmen shall regularly consult with and coordinate policies and priorities with the directors of OMB, the White House Domestic Policy Council, and the White House National Economic Council.  
     (b)  The heads of independent regulatory agencies shall establish a position of White House Liaison in their respective agencies.  Such position shall be in grade 15 of the General Schedule and shall be placed in Schedule C of the excepted service.  
     (c)  Independent regulatory agency chairmen shall submit agency strategic plans developed pursuant to the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 to the Director of OMB for clearance prior to finalization. 
      Sec. 7.  Rules of Conduct Guiding Federal Employees’ Interpretation of the Law. The President and the Attorney General, subject to the President’s supervision and control, shall provide authoritative interpretations of law for the executive branch.  The President and the Attorney General’s opinions on questions of law are controlling on all employees in the conduct of their official duties.  No employee of the executive branch acting in their official capacity may advance an interpretation of the law as the position of the United States that contravenes the President or the Attorney General’s opinion on a matter of law, including but not limited to the issuance of regulations, guidance, and positions advanced in litigation, unless authorized to do so by the President or in writing by the Attorney General. 
      Sec. 8.  General Provisions.  (a)  If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.  
     (b)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:  
     (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or 
     (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.  
     (c)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.  
     (d)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.  "

While a UK regulator continues to say iPhone browser rules are anticompetitive, Apple's detailed response says these findings are wrong and unlawful, plus proposed remedies will create the problems they are supposed to solve. In November 2024, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) released a preliminary report asserting that Apple's rules about web browsers on iPhone were limiting app developers' ability to innovate. Alongside Apple's filing, the CMA has now also published its own summary of Apple's position, following a meeting with the company in December 2024.Where the CMA wants to impose remedies, similar to the EU's Digital Markets Act, on what it sees as anticompetitive issues, Apple says that there are no such issues. Apple also repeatedly questions the legality of the CMA's intention to impose remedies —  and says these remedies will themselves cause harm to developers and consumers.""The CMA cannot simply speculate that market features 'may' have such an effect, nor is it sufficient for the CMA to hypothesize that certain conduct could theoretically be optimized to allow for more competition,"" says Apple in its filing. ""The CMA... has given undue weight to unsupported and outdated complaints, and little to no weight to the interests of consumers in having a user-friendly, stable and secure platform.""""To conclude that there is an [Adverse Effect on Competition] AEC, the CMA must demonstrate the conduct in question results in the purported harm to consumers,"" it continues. ""In fact, the CMA's proposed remedies threaten to degrade the robust iOS security and privacy protections and performance enhancements that Apple has created.""Apple claims that there is already sufficient competition in mobile browsers on iOS. It says that both developers and users are satisfied with the current situation.What happens nextThe CMA has now published its summary of Apple's position, plus Apple's filings, and also similar ones from Google, which also question the legality of the regulator's findings.

It's not clear yet what will happen immediately after this, because in certain investigations, the CMA can extend its consultation period.Apple's arguments that everything should be left as it appears reasonable. Its longstanding claim that harm to security and privacy will come from remedies such as allowing third-party app stores as the EU, are true.Nonetheless, the UK could ultimately see third-party stores being required if the CMA chooses not to recognize the arguments against it.

82,2025-02-19,"Following its announcement at CES 2025 earlier this year, the Lenovo Legion Tab has been dropping in and out of availability, but the company has once again opened up orders for the small Android tablet with this latest wave of stock shipping in March.
The Legion Tab is Lenovo’s first small Android tablet for gaming to be released in the United States. The $499 tablet has an 8.8-inch display, 12GB of RAM, and a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor. It also includes a free case, screen protector, and charger in the box.
Within less than 2 days, though, the Lenovo Legion Tab had fully sold out. Two weeks later, Lenovo re-stocked the tablet with orders to ship in mid-February, but that only lasted a few days, with stock again drying up.
As of February 19, the Lenovo Legion Tab is once again “in stock” and available to order. 
Lenovo is taking orders for the tablet via its online store – still the only place to buy it for now – with estimated deliveries as soon as March 10, though varying depending on your location.
Technically, interested buyers can also get the tablet’s China variant imported to the US, including in a white color variant not sold Stateside, but that comes with headaches as far as the Google Play Store is concerned.

85,2025-02-19,"
Following yesterday’s breakdown of digital camera shipments from 2007 through 2024, it’s time to look at CIPA’s interchangeable lens data. 
The same caveats apply when discussing lenses as when looking at camera data. CIPA only tracks the production of Japanese manufacturers. While this includes the major players, like Canon, Fujifilm, Nikon, Sigma, Sony, and more, it omits some well-known companies. Further, production and shipment numbers do not necessarily align perfectly with sales. However, they will be very close — plenty close enough to discuss the numbers and emerging broad trends. 
While CIPA’s data on digital camera shipments is available back to 2007, lens data goes back even further to 1999. However, it was not until 2011 that CIPA split lens data into full-frame (and larger) and APS-C and smaller categories, which is what this article looks at. Photographers interested in digging into how many leaf-shutter lenses were manufactured in Japan in 2003, or how many medium and large-format lenses were made in 2005, CIPA’s archives are a treasure trove. 
With that housekeeping out of the way, it’s time to pore over 13 years of lens manufacturing data. 
Looking first at total lens manufacturing numbers from 2011 through 2024, the decrease in APS-C and smaller lens production is much more dramatic than the dip in the full-frame (and bigger) space. This aligns with the chart PetaPixel looked at yesterday that broke down digital camera shipments by camera type. The decrease in shipments for cameras with built-in lenses trends with the fall in APS-C and smaller lenses. 
The immediate response is: “Well, sure, but the camera dip was for cameras without lenses altogether.” Yes, but the lens data reflects a shrinking “consumer” photography market, which is broadly reflected across the digital photography landscape. While the people who bought fewer compact cameras are not the same people who bought fewer APS-C and smaller interchangeable lenses, they occupy a similar market segment — people whose photographic needs have been increasingly satisfied by smartphones. 
It is also worth hammering home how stable the full-frame and larger lens space has been, even as the digital camera industry went into freefall. In some crucial ways, this speaks to the health of the core photography market. While the once-dominant entry-level photography space is now the playground of smartphones, photographers have never stopped buying lenses.  
Something important that CIPA’s data omits is which companies are manufacturing which lenses. While Canon and Nikon’s DSLR era is long gone, both companies produced many APS-C DSLRs and lenses in the 2010s. Photographers couldn’t step foot in a Best Buy without tripping over a bunch of $500-ish DSLR kits. The continual reduction in the number of manufactured APS-C lenses speaks to the death of this camera class. 
However, one should not view the shrinking red bar as an indictment of APS-C and Micro Four Thirds camera systems — many professionals use each. Based on this data, it is impossible to speak to the health of something like the Fujifilm X Series, for example. However, based on conversations with numerous industry insiders over the past few years and with the aid of real-world evidence, Fujifilm’s APS-C X Series cameras and lenses are extremely popular. 
The sub-full-frame segment is relatively smaller than a decade ago, but there is reason to believe that the companies that have remained there are financially strong. Sub-full-frame lens manufacturing has stabilized over the past five years, and there’s ample evidence to suggest Fujifilm is an utterly dominant force there, while the similarly-sized full-frame market is being split in three primary ways.

87,2025-02-19,"AI is driving efficiencies across the entire supply chain.
With the help of AI, supply chain operations is becoming smarter and more efficient. What used to be a fraught with inefficiencies, delays, and unpredictability, now is becoming more streamlined. AI is helping supply chains become more efficient, driving down costs, and predicting potential impacts before they become an issue. Automation and AI tools are also helping more effectively forecasting supply and demand, reroute goods in real time, and avoid potentially costly delays.
From optimized inventory management to predictive maintenance and real-time logistics tracking, AI is giving businesses the power to make better, faster decisions. The result? A supply chain that’s not just reactive but proactive and runs on data-driven decisions from start to end.
For product-driven organizations having improper amounts of inventory can have a negative impact on their bottom line. AI systems have proven to be both fast and accurate when looking at large amounts of data. These AI solutions improve demand forecasting accuracy by analyzing historical sales data, market trends, and external factors like weather or economic conditions to predict demand fluctuations, helping companies optimize their levels of inventory.
Previously, inventory management was something that was both a science and an art. Now, AI is helping analyze data in real-time to ensure stores have optimal stock levels. AI tools can predict when stock will need replenishment, helping to prevent overstock and understock of various goods. Because, at the end of the day, companies want to make sure products are available when and where they’re needed. An added bonus is improving overall customer satisfaction as product-driven organizations have more of the demanded supplies in stock.
Additionally, AI enables demand-driven production by looking at data to better predict consumer demand and adjust manufacturing schedules accordingly. This reduces waste, optimizes production resources, and ensures that products are manufactured in the right quantities at the right time, leading to more efficient and responsive supply chains.
When it comes to the supply chain, delays or disruptions can create widespread challenges throughout the entire system. AI is being used to enhance supply chain optimization by analyzing data from various sources to streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve efficiency. AI tools are able to analyze a variety of different factors such as transportation costs, delivery times, and supplier performance to optimize the entire supply chain process.
A critical part of the supply chain is managing risk when it comes to various suppliers. AI helps assess and manage supplier risk by analyzing data related to supplier performance, geopolitical factors, and market conditions. AI-driven platforms can predict disruptions in the supply chain and suggest alternative suppliers or strategies to mitigate risks, ensuring continuity of supply.
Additionally, AI-enabled systems allow companies to respond much quicker to changes in buying behavior by understanding what’s on the shelf and what’s running out. For large scale retailers in particular who have a robust and complex supply chain, this helps provide real-time data and optimize inventory.
To keep supply chain operations running smoothly, that also means machinery and equipment need to be working as expected. After all, if machinery to make the goods or vehicles to deliver the goods at any part of the supply chain are not working as expected or are broken, this has a negative ripple effect on the entire supply chain. AI-driven predictive maintenance is being used to monitor the performance of machinery and equipment in real-time. AI can help predict when maintenance should be performed to avoid unexpected failures reducing downtime and maintenance costs.
If goods can’t get into the hands of consumers, then businesses lose revenue and customer satisfaction plummets. Because of this, warehouse operations are also critically important. AI powers warehouse automation by controlling robots and automated systems that handle tasks like picking, packing, and sorting goods. AI-driven robots enhance warehouse efficiency, reduce labor costs, increase warehouse safety, and improve order accuracy.
Once goods are in warehouses, they need to make their way into the hands of consumers. This “last mile of delivery” is the final step in the delivery process, when an item is transported from a distribution center or store to the customer's doorstep. Last mile of delivery presents unique challenges that make it complex and costly. AI is improving the transportation and logistics of moving goods by analyzing data to determine the most efficient routes, which also helps to reduce fuel consumption, and minimize delivery times.
With the power of AI, companies are better navigating supply chain complexities with greater agility. From optimizing logistics and inventory management to predicting maintenance needs and mitigating supplier risks, AI is transforming the supply chain from beginning to end. And, as AI tools continue to advance, companies that embrace AI-driven solutions will be better positioned to meet the demands of their consumers, better navigate disruptions, and optimize efficiency."

92,2025-02-19,"After having massive success with off-brand weight-loss drugs, the millennial-focused telehealth company Hims & Hers (HIMS+17.24%) is now expanding its offerings to include at-home blood tests.
The company announced today that it has acquired Sigmund NJ, marketed as Trybe Labs, allowing Hims & Hers to offer affordable, at-home blood draws. The company will be using  blood lancets, small medical tools used to prick skin to obtain drops of blood, for its tests. Through the new tests, customers will be able to get lab work done on a variety of health concerns including hormone levels, cardiac risk, stress markers, cholesterol, liver function, thyroid function, and prostate health. 
Healthcare providers on the Hims & Hers platform will then be able to use those tests results to help develop a personalized treatment plan for patients. Additionally, Hims & Hers said it plans to use de-identified data from the tests to accelerate the development of  its AI efforts including  MedMatch, a tool that recommends users personalized treatments. 
 “Access to richer data allows us to deepen the insights that providers can use on our platform to guide their clinical decisions for each individual patient,” said Hims & Hers chief medical officer Dr. Patrick Carroll in a press release. “At-home lab testing is one more exciting step towards elevating the personal, comprehensive care customers in this country should expect.”
Hims & Hers said the transaction is complete and was funded through cash, but it did not disclose how much it paid to acquire Sigmund NJ. The company plans to roll out its new blood tests to customers over the next year.
Hims & Hers stock rose over 16% on Wednesday morning following the news. The company’s stock has skyrocketed in the past year soaring over 500% in the past 12 months. 
Hims & Hers was founded in 2017, known as just “Hims” at the time, as a platform for men to get prescriptions online for erectile dysfunction and hair loss medications. Since then, it has expanded to offer treatments for men and women to address skin care, anxiety, and overall sexual health.
Last May, Hims & Hers began offering customers compounded semaglutide — the active ingredient in the popular weight-loss treatments Ozempic (NVO+1.15%) and Wegovy  — for just $199 a month. That’s hundreds of dollars cheaper than Ozempic’s nearly $1,000 list price and Wegovy’s $1,349 price tag.

93,2025-02-19,"The crypto ecosystem has come a long way since the implosion of Sam Bankman Fried's FTX destroyed billions in investor wealth in 2023. However, the industry as a whole needs to more to become bulletproof, said TradFi experts at the ""Views From Wall Street to Crypto"" event held at Consensus Hong Kong on Wednesday.
""You have traditional players who have come into the space now, especially for us, most of our trading happens of exchange settlement, where you actually keep your assets on custodians while you are able to trade on exchanges,"" Gautam Sharma, CEO and CIO of Brevan Howard Digital said. ""So the technology has come far ahead in terms of the last 18 months since then, [but] there's more work to do.""
Sharma stressed the need for 24/7 risk management, including market, counterparty, and credit risks.
Counterparty risk refers to the possibility of one party involved in a transaction failing to meet its obligation, resulting in a loss to the other party. This type of risk is higher in crypto than in traditional finance, given the absence of intermediaries such as banks or clearing houses that ensure trust and settlements, and it is a cause of concern for both directional and non-directional arbitration players.
""When we do arbitrage, the counterparty risk is the most important one,"" Fabio Frontini, founder of Abraxas Capital Management, said, adding that credit risk is also very important.
Frontini stressed the importance of simulating stress testing scenarios, referring to the perpetual futures market where users can lose the margin when stopped out on a trade, which is not the case in traditional markets. ""It [stress testing] can be very rewarding, when done properly,"" Frontini added.
Mike Kuehnel, CEO of the market-making firm Flow Traders, highlighted the need to make innovation transparent to win over investor confidence and ensure ""availability of data and moving liquidity without fragmentation around it.""
""Getting the best price and giving you the possibility to transact whenever you want to is a key ingredient,"" Kuehnel added.
Liquidity, or the ability of the market to absorb large orders at stable prices, emerged as a significant concern following the collapse of FTX and its sister concern, Alameda. While the order book depth has surely improved for major coins, fragmentation or distribution of liquidity across multiple DeFi platforms, blockchains and networks, remains a concern.
CORRECTION (Feb. 19, 10:30 UTC): Corrects Sharma's first name to Gautam in first bullet point, company affiliation to Brevan Howard Digital throughout. An earlier version said he held his positions at the parent, Brevan Howard.

Virgin Atlantic has announced a new codeshare partnership with WestJet to support its London to Toronto route, aiming to simplify travel for passengers and expand its customer base. The partnership is strategically important for Virgin as it targets India's large diaspora in Canada, which significantly influences travel demand. While the partnership is set to enhance travel options between Canada and the UK, further developments, particularly related to Indian routes, are pending regulatory approvals.
Ahead of its return to Canada next month, Virgin Atlantic is laying the groundwork with a new commercial agreement. 
Earlier this week, the British carrier announced an enhanced partnership with Calgary-based WestJet. The codeshare deal will start on March 30 to coincide with the launch of Virgin’s new London to Toronto route. 
A codeshare allows airlines to sell seats on a flight operated by the other with each company using their own flight number. For passengers, it means a more streamlined journey with single-ticket itineraries and more efficient baggage handling. For airlines, it broadens the pool of potential customers and should boost sales.
While the deal is an important step towards making Virgin’s new route a commercial success, there’s an even bigger prize in the airline’s sights. In a media release issued on Monday, India was mentioned on four separate occasions. No other countries – aside from Canada and the United Kingdom – were directly referenced. So what’s going on?
Canada’s large Indian diaspora is a key factor. According to India’s Ministry of External Affairs, there are almost 1.7 million ""overseas Indians"" in Canada. India is Canada’s top source country for permanent residents, accounting for around a quarter of overall admissions in recent years. It is also a top source country for temporary foreign workers and international students.
The growing Indian population in Canada fuels demand for business and leisure travel between the two countries. Air Canada and Air India serve Delhi nonstop from Toronto, however, there are no year-round nonstop flights to Mumbai. 
Indian routes from other Canadian cities typically make a tech stop in London, adding to overall journey times. Connecting options via the Middle East are limited compared to those from European or U.S. cities.
With all of this in mind, Virgin is hoping that it can tap its existing Indian network to funnel WestJet passengers through Toronto and Heathrow. 
The Branson-backed carrier has been serving India for almost 25 years and flies to Delhi, Mumbai, and the southern city of Bengaluru from London. Its five daily flights offer more than a million seats to and from India annually, which Virgin calls “a key strategic market.” 
Juha Jarvinen, Chief Commercial Officer at Virgin Atlantic recently described India as “a huge opportunity” for the airline, adding that the company is “anticipating a huge growth in demand for international travel from the region.” 
Based on current schedules, the Indian Subcontinent is Virgin Atlantic’s third-largest overseas market. 
The agreement brings new options for 13 Canadian cities to and from London Heathrow via Toronto. The two carriers will be based at Terminal 3 at Toronto Pearson International Airport to improve transit times. Virgin is also partnering with stakeholders including the Greater Toronto Airports Authority and Canada Border Services Agency, “to support customer connections onwards via eligible cities.”
Unfortunately for Virgin Atlantic, this week’s WestJet deal doesn’t (yet) extend to Indian flights. Describing the agreement as a “first phase,” the British carrier confirmed to Skift that such itineraries are still pending regulatory approvals. A WestJet spokesperson also told Skift that work is continuing to secure the relevant permissions needed to add its code to other Virgin Atlantic services. 
If – or when – realized, the rewards could be significant. For example, a passenger from Edmonton could fly on a WestJet aircraft to Toronto, before connecting to Virgin’s network to London and India.
In a statement, John Weatherill, Chief Commercial Officer at WestJet, hinted that further developments will follow, noting that the airlines “look forward to building closer ties in the months ahead, providing more options to connect Canada with the world."" 
The deal marks the latest stage in a deepening partnership between the carriers. Notably, Virgin Atlantic lacks a member of its SkyTeam alliance in Canada. As a workaround, in recent years it has struck a series of agreements with WestJet. 
The Canadian airline does not belong to any of the big three airline alliances, meaning it can make ad-hoc partnerships with a range of global carriers. These include big-name brands such as Delta, Cathay Pacific, Qantas, and Emirates. Loyalty partnership program benefits across both Virgin Atlantic Flying Club and WestJet Rewards are also expected to roll out before the end of 2025.
The Skift India Forum returns to Delhi-NCR on March 17-18, 2025. Speakers include Air India CEO, Campbell Wilson, and Pieter Elbers, CEO of IndiGo. Click here for more information and to book your ticket.

95,2025-02-19,"Brad and Byam Lovell in their Ford Bronco Raptor. 
Considered one of the most grueling off-road races in the world, the annual King of the Hammers event combines desert racing and rock crawling. The Johnson Valley, Nevada-based event attracts its share of veteran off-roaders and new adventurers who want to tackle the annual challenge in a variety of tough vehicles. This year, Off-Road Hall of Famer and multi-time champion Brad Lovell scrabbled his way to a Desert Challenge win. Driving in the Stock OEM class with his son Adam in the navigator seat, the Lovells cruised to victory in a Ford Bronco.
Ford Performance swept the podium in the 4600 Stock Class of the Every Man Challenge, marking the fourth consecutive year of Bronco wins. Lovell, who has been driving Broncos for many years, is a fan from both a personal and professional standpoint.
“Broncos have been absolutely dominant,"" Lovell says. “Jeeps are very durable and more simple and they have been competitive, but the advancements in the Bronco proves Ford is head and shoulders above.”
The race-prepared Bronco was built with Lovell’s guidance by the Geiser Brothers team in Arizona. It’s powered by a production-based 2.7-liter EcoBoost engine, 10-speed automatic transmission, a high-strength steel chassis, off-road-ready 2.5-inch Fox shocks, Dana axles, and knobby 35-inch BFGoodrich tires. The SUV had to withstand some gnarly conditions and it took a beating, emerging at the finish line safely with the elated father-son team up front.

Brad Lovell entered his first rock-crawling competition in 2004 and has been at it ever since. The drive has notched wins at Ultra 4, short-course, and off-road desert racing, winning nine season championships and over 35 race victories. Lovell came by his passion for off-roading through his dad, who took his two boys out in his old Ford Bronco in their Colorado hometown. By the time he was 16, Lovell was competing in rock-crawling events.
After completing college, Lovell took a job in the engineering field. He earned enough money to buy a Ford Ranger and turned it into a racing truck, using the skills he learned in his dad’s garage. Alongside his brother Roger, Lovell won four events in his debut season. Then something magical happened: Lovell and his wife became the proud parents to twin boys. On the day they were born, Lovell says, he quit his engineering job and jumped into racing full time. That’s a lot of stress in one week for a typical young family, and Lovell gives his wife credit for encouraging and supporting him all the way.
“There were some slim times, for sure,” Lovell remembers.

The slim times are behind them now, and the Lovells are all in. Racing for more than two decades requires a lot of travel, and Lovell’s family members are intentional about maintaining their close bonds. In the long term, Lovell says, racing is a very intense career path, with the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. Those twin boys—Adam and Byam—are 18 now, and they’re part of the Lovell racing dynasty now too. They were raised in the garage with their dad, learning how to wrench at a young age.
“It’s important to me to present as a father, so we’ve always had the shop at the house,” Lovell says with pride. “If I’m gone racing, I can’t be gone at the shop away from home, too. The boys have always had access to tools, spare parts, and the opportunity to get in the shop.”
These days, you’ll find the Lovells all working and racing together.
“We’re enthusiasts,” Lovell says. “When we’re home, we’re going to the mountains to go off-roading or we’re working on our cars.”
How many of those are of the Ford Bronco persuasion? Quite a few; Lovell estimates he has about 15 vehicles and he’s always been a Ford fan. As he continues to rack up more wins for Ford Performance, it won’t be any surprise if amasses a few more.
