People didn't buy windows phones because they sucked.
Microsoft trying to make a tiny kernel version of windows wasn't going to help even if they managed to pull it off.  Windows wasn't never intended or designed to run on small systems or in pseudo real time.  Windows NT was the first Windows with any form of real multi tasking/threading worth talking about and that shit wasn't going to squeeze down from the data center where it was intended to be used to a dinky phone.
And even let's assume that yeah sure t

What're you talking about?!  They all had that neat little hole on the back that you could stick a paper clip in to reset them every six hours when they locked up.  Super convenient.
It's the usual path for selling a book about your life, career and legacy.

I agree, the OS didn't implement many system calls, essentially making it a ""the light is on but nobody home"" operating system. Ir did just return a value saying that it was ok, but the expected result didn't show up.
No wonder that app makers gave up on creating for that os.
Everything that Microsoft got nailed to the wall for with their antitrust problems is known as ""business as usual"" for Apple and Google.  Both platforms come with the OS preloaded on their hardware, both bundle their own first party browser, and they even go a bit further than Microsoft ever did by restricting user root access to the OS itself.  Don't even get me started on app signing and locked bootloaders.
The smartphone market turned into absolutely everything we feared Microsoft would do to the PC indus 
Everything that Microsoft got nailed to the wall for with their antitrust problems is known as ""business as usual"" for Apple and Google.Sorry I don't remember Apple or Google threatening Intel not to release a Java compiler for x86 because they feared Java. I don't remember either of them then releasing an incompatible version of Java just to screw over Sun.  I don't remember either of them kindly remind OEMs that if they did business with Netscape and didn't preinstall Internet Explorer, they might lose their favored Windows OEM pricing. As much as Google and Apple does, you seem to forget what MS did back in the day.

Windows CE was not really bloated. The original XBox ran it and smart phones are as powerful as the original XBox.
Early Android was basically a blackberry clone with touch screen ability tacked on.  It lagged and stuttered tremendously.  Google ""solved"" that by beefing up hardware power over the years, but it's still not really as pixel perfect smooth or responsive as iOS, which was designed with touch control as the priority.
I don't think that's correct. Most original XBOX games used the DirectX API that Microsoft provided, and integrated into the OS e.g. to allow you to copy your own music to the HDD and replace the in-game stuff, or to use XBOX Live.
The issue with emulation is that the GeForce NV2A chip in it has some quirks to the way to renders stuff.
That's not the kind of miss Microsoft would normally make. As you might imagine because they did that their phones were relegated to a filing cabinet in a basement behind a sign that said beware of leopard.During the early 2000-s, Microsoft had very real mobile OS: WinCE. It had a nice programming API, basically a cut-down version of Win32. I can see a world where Microsoft iterated on WinCE and pre-empted Apple by several years. Microsoft was even pushing tablet computing long before iPad. 
Their main problem indeed was a total lack of focus. I think Joel Spolsky told stories about how the Microsoft Word team was allergic to pen input (on tablets). Or Pocket Excel not being able to read the real Excel files

The problem was the ""windows"" branding...
Buyers expected compatibility with the versions of windows they were already familiar with, but there was none. You couldn't run your existing apps.The xbox was not windows branded, and was a lot more successful. Apple also differentiated ios from macos so that users didn't expect any type of compatibility between the two.
For others the windows name already had a bad taste. They might have been stuck with it on desktop computers due to existing lock-in, but they were 
The problem was the ""windows"" branding...That and the fact that the UI was an absolute disaster for usability on a phone-sized device.Microsoft did okay with the Xbox because they had a template to copy from the other established console manufacturers, and they resisted whatever urges they might've had to just make it a box that runs Windows on your TV.  The fact that it ran an embedded version of Windows under the hood didn't matter because the end user never saw it.

Dude mobile OS's were going nowhere with the point and click paradigm.
Was never going to fly on smartphones without some heavy duty antitrust law violations. And I think they just had a little too much attention on them at the time.

The idea with embedded/mobile versions of Windows was that developers could use a familiar API to bring apps to the platform. The problem with that is that mobile apps need a really good touch interface, and it encouraged developers to stick with desktop style interfaces. They tried to mitigate it with bad hardware like a stylus and tiny keyboard.
Many early attempts at touchscreen portables running desktop Windows had the same problem.
It could have easily been foreseen too, because it happened multiple time

Why is he gaslighting us into thinking Windows Phone didn't exist?
Or the Nokia acquisition.
The market didn't want what he was selling.
If you want to point fingers, it was Blackberry and BES - corporate learned that phones didn't need to be a Microsoft product.
Because you didn't even finish reading TFS

He never said he didn't do it. He said he didn't do it well enough.
Well, he's right about that. If he could only be as honest about his impact on computing as about that, maybe I wouldn't hate his guts.
The early Windows phones (all of the wince ones) were bad technically, but they were also bad in other ways. Most had bad hardware to go with the bad software.
I know a far more important guy who keeps turning up in photos with Epstein. When asked about releasing the files he said it would be problematic for some people.
Or the Nokia acquisition. The market didn't want what he was selling.That was long after Bill Gates stepped away from Microsoft entirely in 2008.

 ... this unadulterated good thing ... Gates took free code, improved the UI, then sold it.  That wasn't enough so he then added vendor lock-in.  When he added forced bundling of software, the government got upset.  The government got upset again, when Microsoft tried to buy competing software.  Gates, the poster-boy of not-free software, knew the ""good"" didn't survive in the world of profit. ... $100 billion he has donated ...I guess Gates gave-up one dream, owning the world.  But that's a common mind-set in the USA.  It'll be interesting to see what this decade's billionaires do

What free code did he take? The only thing I can think of is early versions of Windows used the BSD network stack, but it was quickly replaced.
He allegedly stole code for an open-source draft version of BASIC for x86 and tweaked it.
Microsoft almost had the smartphone OS market?  Can we get Vin Diesel  [youtube.com] to explain to Bill how far from reality that statement is?
The unwashed masses were never going to accept Windows CE on their phones.  It was a clunky, difficult-to-use OS, bringing all the worst design paradigms of Windows to a device too small and underpowered for anything even remotely resembling a decent user experience.  People only suffered through using those devices because they were tech enthusiasts living on the bleeding edge, or

His claim is that MS was positioned to have the entire smartphone market- and lost it.In order to be positioned to take something it first has to be within your capabilities to grasp it in the first place.  Microsoft's corporate culture was simply antithetical to them ever winning over the smartphone market.  They would've had to have been willing to flush Windows CE down the toilet much earlier in the game and Microsoft has never been an innovative company - embrace, extend, extinguish was how they've always competed.

Microsoft was so firmly intrenched in their when the only tool you have is a hammer belief that the only way they'd have captured the smartphone market was if the general public actually had a different opinion of Windows CE.

Microsoft can re-enter the phone market at any time they wish. The only tangible difference between a Windows on ARM gaming handheld and a Windows phone is the dialer app.
Windows 10 Mobile morphs into an XBox phone with a simple recompile, it's all the latest iteration of Windows NT under the covers. Don't forget they implemented, then abandoned, an Android compatibility layer for Windows 11.
Just don't market it as a phone. Sell it as an XBox, that makes calls.
Microsoft can re-enter the phone market at any time they wish.The problem is that they're not really in a position to extract profit from the phone market.  The hardware side of things is cutthroat.  The OS side their two major competitors give their OS away for free.  That leaves trying to make money off the app developers by taking a cut of their revenue, and whoops, big chicken-and-egg problem there since nobody is going to develop for a platform that has few users.Microsoft could certainly re-enter the mobile landscape if they wanted to just set money on fire, but

Like I suggested, they would not making a phone, they'd be making a handheld XBox that happens to make phone calls.
The revenue would come from games.

By the time Microsoft finally got serious about designing a mobile OS where usability was a consideration, it was far too late.  Android and iOS already had established their duopoly and Microsoft was relegated to being an also-ran with abysmal third party app support.Add that MS cannot really do usability. (Or reliability or security...) They just scrape by on barely usable and that only works with a monopoly. Seems to get worse (again) at this time as well. Their crap wastes to much time that anybody that has alternatives stays away.

I still can't decide if gates is just a savvy businessman or a supervillan.
His business behaviour in the 90's was grotesque and it's the reason the majority of the business world has to essentially pay a tax to Gates for his operating system and his office software.I much would have preferred open source won the business eyeballs battle, but gates was always a step ahead where it mattered.- He had Visual Basic (and Borland Turbo Pascal on windows). I know the /. community loves to scoff at VB & VB6, but allowed semi skilled programmers to write line of business applications that otherwise wouldn't have been written.- He had active directory which was a game changer in managing large IT systems.- He had a unified registry which was easier to navigate compared to Unix/Linux hundreds of config files.- He had .NET/C# which made professional software development easy.So really, I think MS was always a step ahead of the open source community, and when employee time can be hundreds per hour, his solutions become cheap compared to the alternative.
I still think there something deeply dark about the man though.

Actually, I took it as a threat of physical violence in response to a hyperbolic suggestion that ""people who do stupid thing X should be shot"".

True for large companies, but there are a lot of SME's who don't have the same security requirements.They want to, convert some CAD data for a machine, or write a test program for a circuit board, or create an aged inventory report for a bean counter, or have a dash board for staff on site today.

Despite all appearances, your boss is a thinking, feeling, human being."
1,2025-02-09,"With so many cheap oscilloscopes out there, the market for old units isn’t what it used to be. But if you have a really old scope, like the Heathkit O-10 that [Ken] found in his basement, there is vintage cred to having one. [Ken’s] didn’t work, so a repair session ensued. You can see the results in the video below.
You can tell this is in an old scope — probably from the mid 1950s — because of its round tube with no graticle. Like many period scopes, the test probe input was just 5-way binding posts. The O-10 was the first Heathkit “O-series” scope that used printed circuit boards.
The device looked pretty good inside, except for a few dents. Of course, the box has tubes in it, so every power up test involves waiting for the tubes to warm up. [Ken] was very excited when he finally got a single green dot on the screen. That did, however, require a new CRT.
It wasn’t long after that he was able to put a waveform in and the scope did a good job of reproducing it. The unit would look good in an old movie, but might not be the most practical bench instrument these days.
These Heathkit scopes and their cousins were very popular in their day. The $70 price tag sounds cheap, but in the mid-1950s, that was about a month’s rent in a four-room house. While primitive by today’s standards, scopes had come a long way in 9 or 10 years.


Used to see those Heathkit units at the larger flea markets, rather often.
 I think some of them were eventually tossed by the dumpster on Sunday and then someone else just grabbed it for the next weekend. Ad infinitum. Thus I probably wasn’t seeing as many as I first thought. People wanting 50~80 dollars for them.
Sometimes crusty/ashy, looked like they had been stored in an idled poultry barn or leaky trailer. Gotta love those Craigslist/Flea market guys that will scrub anything with “purple/green cleaner” and then spray it with tire & wheel shine.
I’ve got one I scored from a hamfest, a bit older than the one here but a 10mhz Heathkit. Came with free cobwebs and dead spiders!
I have one sitting on my shelf. I have opened the case to look at the wiring and tubes. it needs a cleaning and there is at least one wire which needs to be replaced. It runs through the whole device and is very very corroded.
I rescued one of these from the trash. The great thing about them is that their calibration is as good today as it was when they were new.

3,2025-02-09,"Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has said there are ""no excuses"" to not build the 1.5 million new homes Labour promised in its election manifesto.
The government has said it will meet the house-building target in England by 2029, before the next general election.
BBC analysis shows the number of new homes in England continued to fall during the first six months Labour was in power.
Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Rayner said Labour knew hitting the target ""was going to be really difficult"", given housebuilding trends before it entered government - but said she was determined to meet it.
The housing, communities and local government secretary said that within a month of taking office, she was asked if she wanted to review Labour's housing target.
""I wasn't going to give up on the target,"" she said.
She said she was personally ""determined to meet that 1.5 million target"" and said policies such as reforming the planning system would ""take time"" to have an impact.
She added: ""There are no excuses to not build those homes that people desperately need.
""And we mean business on this, because far too many people are not getting these homes.""
Gillian Keegan, a former Conservative MP and education secretary, told the programme the pace of housebuilding was ""too slow"".
She said the Conservatives had also promised to build more than 1.5 million new homes in its 2024 election manifesto, adding that the party had made ""a lot of progress"" when in government ""but the reality is, it's still too slow"".
""The highest number we got to was about 249,000 in one year,"" she said.
""Now obviously we had to navigate Brexit, Covid and a war in Europe at the time.
""But that shows you the size of the challenge.""
Labour hopes building more homes will reduce house prices and make buying and renting homes more affordable, especially for younger people.
Its target means building an average of 300,000 new homes a year - a number not achieved since the 1970s.
In recent years, the number of new homes built annually has been considerably below that figure.
The housing industry has expressed doubts about Labour's housing target and whether it can be reached by 2029.
The construction industry has warned it is dealing with a chronic shortage of skilled workers.
There are also concerns about the availability of basic building materials, including bricks and timber.
And many housing experts are unsure whether private housebuilders are able or willing to deliver enough new homes each year.
It comes as Rayner's department set out plans to speed up the house-buying process and give more power to leaseholders.
The government said it plans to cut transaction times by bringing in digital identity services and date-sharing.
At the moment, it can take months for paperwork relating to the sale of a home to be exchanged and checked by mortgage companies and others involved in the process.
The government said under a fully digitalised home-buying and selling process, ""the information key parties need – from mortgage companies to surveyors – will be within reach immediately, with the necessary identity checks carried out once"".
The housing department said it was working with the property market and the Land Registry to agree rules on data-sharing and digital ID verification services.
There are also plans to empower leaseholders to take control of their buildings more easily, through right-to-manage.
Right-to-manage lets some leasehold home owners take over management of the building - even without the agreement of the landlord - and gives them control over how their service charges are spent.
The government said it would introduce changes to the Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act 2024 on Monday.
Housing and Planning Minister Matthew Pennycook said the reforms build on the government's plan to deliver ""1.5 million safe and decent homes in this Parliament, and our ongoing efforts to protect leaseholders suffering from unfair and unreasonable practices"".
Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has spoken to the BBC about the decision to demolish Grenfell Tower.
The deputy PM tells the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg that she doesn't feel she was ""aggressive"" during the meeting.
A blizzard of statistics show just how tough it is to buy a home if you can theoretically afford it, writes Laura Kuenssberg.
Angela Rayner says the tower block will be dismantled - an announcement which has had a mixed reaction.
Angela Rayner says the reorganisation marks a generational power shift but the Tories say it is a ""worrying day"".

4,2025-02-09,"Amanda Hope dreads to think how much she has spent on her collection of Jellycat soft toys but reckons it's more than £3,000.
""They are just so cute and cuddly,"" the 36-year-old software specialist from Surrey says. ""There is something so irresistible about their happy little faces!""
Amanda is one of a rising number of adults buying toys for themselves. 
And it's not just Jellycats, it's also the likes of Lego plastic bricks and Sonny Angels dolls filling up TikTok feeds as people post videos of their latest purchases.
One in five toys and games is now bought by over-18s for themselves, according to toy industry research group Circana.
The research found buying collectibles had positive mental health benefits that helped adults cope with turmoil.
From eggs with faces to smiley coffee cups, the Jellycat craze has made a big impact on the toy industry and a TikTok trend for unboxing Sonny Angels has put the tiny dolls in high demand.
These toys don't necessarily come cheap though. Jellycats range in price from £11 to over £700, while Lego gift sets for adults can cost as much as £730.
So why are so many adults spending their disposable income on toys?
""The popularity of Sonny Angel and Jellycat illustrates the growing kidult trend,"" says Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, who has covered the retail sector for many years.
""Although globally toy sales saw a small 0.6% decline overall in 2024, collectible toys saw record sales.""
Sonny Angels are sold in blind boxes so customers never know what they will get and therefore may buy more.
Ms Streeter thinks ""a desire to be part of a fandom universe"" is fuelling sales and the need for nostalgia ""amid the stresses of adulthood"".
Elle Lynn, 23, estimates she's spent £2,300 on her Jellycat collection and around £500 collecting Lego.
She thinks the building aspect of Lego can help adults switch off from their hectic lives.
""I find it quite therapeutic to build. It helps me switch off from a busy high-stress day,"" says Elle, who works as a project co-ordinator.
""And it's fun to have some of your favourite characters.""
Elle says she would probably have more Lego if it weren't for the cost.
""For some of the larger Lego sets they do tend to come at a larger price so they aren't as easily attainable,"" she says.
As well as just selling the toys, Jellycats has started putting on pop-up ""experiences"". Currently at London's Selfridges you can buy exclusive fish and chips soft toys, sold to you by an assistant pretending to fry and put salt and vinegar on your selected teddies.
Amanda visited the pop-up twice, once for herself and once to get a present for a friend.
Videos of such experiences have millions of views online, with fans essentially advertising to each other - the same applies to the Sonny Angel unboxing trend.
Melissa Symonds, executive director of toys at analysts Circana, thinks social media is playing a big role in toy advertising and sales.
""Millions of people are watching social media,"" she says.
""They're rediscovering old favourites and even brands that are becoming involved in the current trends are starting to drive footfall through awareness on social media.""
Twenty-two-year-old Jessica buys Jellycats frequently and has built up a collection worth over £1,000, which she posts about on TikTok.
""On payday I treat myself to one or two, and a few more through the month,"" says the sales assistant from Ipswich.
""When I've had a bad day and I know a Jellycat is on its way, I look forward to seeing it in real life and adding it to my overflowing shelf.""
She likens the soft toys to Ty Beanie Babies, one of the biggest toy trends of the 1990s.
""I feel like the fun of collecting and displaying the two are similar.""
Both Jellycats and Sonny Angels often sell out quickly with retailers.
""This in turn pushes up the prices which can be charged in private resales,"" says Susannah Streeter.
This is something Jessica experienced when she wanted to buy the peach Jellycat that went viral last year but couldn't find it in stock anywhere.
She ended up paying double the price for it on Vinted, and thinks you shouldn't be allowed to resell toys online for sky-high prices.
According to Melissa Symonds from Circana, the kidult trend is showing no signs of slowing down.
While she thinks that Jellycat stands out for managing ""to hit that sweet spot of getting collectibles across all ages but also appealing to adults and at a fairly premium pricing"", she says there are other brands snapping at its heels.
She points to Ty, Aurora and Posh Paws as the ones to watch for upcoming plush toys.
Ipswich Borough Assets says it has had many queries from people wanting to buy the sign. 
An ""unsettled economy"" is blamed for falling sales of toys for the third consecutive year.
Bob Brechin sells more than 100 items from the Action Man and Star Wars ranges at auction.
Star Wars, Tiny Tears and Action Man rarities are among Bob Brechin's collection being sold.
This year's annual charity ""present pick"" sees 418 children go home with a gift of their choice.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Enbridge's shares on or after the 14th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 1st of March.
The company's next dividend payment will be CA$0.9425 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of CA$3.66 per share. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Enbridge stock has a trailing yield of around 5.9% on the current share price of CA$63.51. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.
 See our latest analysis for Enbridge 
Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Enbridge distributed an unsustainably high 123% of its profit as dividends to shareholders last year. Without more sustainable payment behaviour, the dividend looks precarious. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Enbridge paid out more free cash flow than it generated - 116%, to be precise - last year, which we think is concerningly high. It's hard to consistently pay out more cash than you generate without either borrowing or using company cash, so we'd wonder how the company justifies this payout level.
Cash is slightly more important than profit from a dividend perspective, but given Enbridge's payouts were not well covered by either earnings or cash flow, we would be concerned about the sustainability of this dividend.

Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Fortunately for readers, Enbridge's earnings per share have been growing at 15% a year for the past five years. Earnings are growing pretty quickly, which is great, but it's uncomfortably to see the company paying out 123% of earnings. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, we feel this is a clear concern around the sustainability of the dividend.
Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years, Enbridge has increased its dividend at approximately 10% a year on average. It's great to see earnings per share growing rapidly over several years, and dividends per share growing right along with it.
From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Enbridge? While it's nice to see earnings per share growing, we're curious about how Enbridge intends to continue growing, or maintain the dividend in a downturn given that it's paying out such a high percentage of its earnings and cashflow. It's not an attractive combination from a dividend perspective, and we're inclined to pass on this one for the time being.
Although, if you're still interested in Enbridge and want to know more, you'll find it very useful to know what risks this stock faces. For example - Enbridge has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.

over the past 3 years. Not a single interview. It's fuckin' weird. Twenty years in the industry. I've had recruiters, headhunters, etc, all look at my resume and tell me that they can't find any problem with it or red flags, it just seems like the industry is filled with former FAANG (or whatever the current acronym is) to fill the jobs that are posted.

Writing as a second-tier programmer in my best days, though several of my projects did live long after me. But I worked with and for a number of first-tier programmers and they rarely failed to amaze me with their insights and code productivity. (Metric of my age that at least two of them have already passed away?) I loved the differences, but eventually I concluded I was never going to get to that tier and I moved on to other stuff. (And got more money? Go figure... Must be that Ricardo guy again.)
  why would any employer want second-rate code from an in-house programmer when they can cheaply copy the first-rate stuff? 
I've been a professional programmer for decades and have been trying to work AI into my workflow for a while now.
The thing is almost every time I ask AI to do something, what I get is not that first rate stuff you are talking about.  It's often stuff that is incomplete or doesn't even work at all without modification.  And yes, coding is not at all immune from hallucination as it will als

It's also important to note that the Amish aren't all uniform in what they use or don't use. The only generality in things is they believe in hard work over play. Most Amish communities also banish their kids for a couple of years once they turn 18 - this is to let them experience the world as a whole, and to let them choose - they can either return back to the community to the lifestyle they knew, or they could have the freedom to enter the modern world.

You have a certain level of skill and productivity; its up to the capitalist employer to determine if they will choose to hire you and pay your salary.

Tell me again what's left?War, of course. Trump and his elite of billionaires are tuning the old-school 3 minutes of hate all the way up to 24/7/365. Conservative sources, for instance, are commemorating how the recently approved demonizing and persecution of powerless minorities have been already resulting in increased recruitment rates.That build-up won't be for nothing. As any autocrat knows, nothing fixes social unrest like directing that unrest at imaginary internal and external enemies.

Tell me again what's left?Plenty of jobs.  The catch is, they probably don't pay enough to cover your living expenses.One of my friends has been trying to find a new job because the company he presently works for has cut out on-call pay while still expecting 24/7 availability as part of his existing salary.  They've also been laying his co-workers off and he's afraid that they'll eventually do the same for him.  He's had no luck finding a similar position at another company without taking a massive pay cut.At least according to him, the reason isn't AI but just the usual economic ""right sizing"" efforts of the company.  Trim off the excess fat and the company's financials superficially look better, that's how the game is played.

There will always be a need for plumbers.

For repairs. 
But if inflation/unemployment hit hard enough, new construction will slow, and plumbers will experience higher unemployment numbers.
If you go into a trade and you're doing bad they tell you you should have gone to college. If you go to college and you're not doing all that well they tell you you should have gone into a trade.The usual right-wing talking point is that you shouldn't have majored in underwater multi-cultural gender studies or something along those lines.  Most people who have achieved college degrees and find themselves disappointed with their job prospects tend to regret their choice of major, not the decision to attend college.  Trade work is rough on your body and the pay is highly market dependent.

I'm hoping I can find a place with a former-employee discount, you know, kind of a start as an employee, end as a client sort of thing.
The explosion of outsourced call centers, support centers, and cloud services in the last 10 years have cut heavily into the need for domestic employees in IT. The ease of getting H1B visas for technology work have compounded the problem, as has overseas ownership of technology companies.
Job losses in tech can be attributed in part to the influence of AI, according to Victor Janulaitis,Part?...well how much?  10%? 1%? 0.001%?  AI is not really proving itself to be useful enough to replace an employee.  Sure, AI vendors make promises, but I think this has more mundane explanations.  Interest rates were so low that borrowing money was nearly free...so every company began talent hoarding....interest rates rose and thus borrowing money is not free...so now companies are hiring more sensibly.  The big tech firms used to perceptually hire as many sharp minds as they could and figure out what to do with them later... well...now that capital is not so freely flowing, they're doing more conventional practices, like identifying a need then hiring for it.  They've gone from gluttonous appetites for spending and growth to more sensible strategies like a normal business.   
So yeah, if Google, Facebook, Apple, MS, etc were all hiring 10-25% more engineers than they actually needed...with the hope that their divisions would grow into needing them in the near future...and suddenly stopped, that hits our industry really hard.   
AI is making people less ambitious about hiring extra talent, but I don't believe it's at the point where it actually reduces existing needs.  I work with it daily...All the major vendors produce mostly garbage.  It's ""kinda cool""...but at this point, I can't tell if I am spending more time fixing AI bugs from IntelliJ and CoPilot than it would have taken me to write the code without AI assistance.  Both products mostly produce code that not only doesn't work or solve the problem, but often doesn't even compile.  At best, it's an upgrade to StackOverflow for me.    I haven't fully given up and keep trying, but realistically, it's like a roomba...fun to play with...not useless...but...no one fired their maid after buying a roomba and no one will anytime soon.  No hotel replaced part of their cleaning staff with roombas.  Most believe a roomba is more trouble than they're worth.  Unless these LLMs improve drastically, I think something similar will happen with programmers.  No one will completely dismiss Generative AI and will want their programmers to use it for potential productivity gains, but I don't think they're good enough you can cut headcount (unless you over hired in the first place).

>> mostly produce code that not only doesn't work or solve the problem, but often doesn't even compile
I share your concerns but I think these things are rapidly improving.
As an experiment, today I told a coding assistant (I use Windsurf) to write an Android app that would scan for available WiFi access points and list them when a button is pushed. It constructed the project directory structure and wrote the code in under a minute. Sure enough, it wouldn't compile. But I asked it to fix the specific co 
Yes, but.
Grand-grandparent is underestimating the fact that it took all his (human) experience to figure out how to get from a buggy AI-generated code, to a workable product. Put someone who has never done any programming and ask him to ""write an Android app that would scan for available WiFi access points and list them when a button is pushed"". Pretty sure the app will never happen, even if AI generates a preliminary code version.
We have been trained, we know what bugs look like, we know how to correct them (or to steer the AI towards the correction). We have the intuition of the cause of the problem when a problem occurs. This is what makes us experienced.
It's the good old $10000 ""hitting the machine with a hammer to repair it"" story all over again. CEO will complain why you're asking $10000 for something which took a few minutes. AI generation costs $1. Expertise to use it costs $9999.
The long-term issue I think is that we will become lazy, ask the AI to do more and more stuff for us, and eventually lose our experience, just like after a few years of using the GPS, we lose our sense of orienteering. This is why I try to steer clear from AI (and GPS) as much as I can.
>> took all his (human) experience to figure out how to get from a buggy AI-generated code, to a workable product
It did, no doubt, but I am very rusty with phone apps. It would have taken me far longer to research the API for the networking, look at code examples on the internet, type in the code and get the syntax right, etc. In this case it took me about 45 minutes to go from zero to something that compiled, installed, and ran correctly. This is a significant cost savings that may partially explain why IT unemployment is rising.
My next step was to ask for an enhancement whereby I could select a WiFi access point from the list and connect to it. Oddly, the coding assistant claimed that the app already did this and displayed some code that presumably accomplished it. But that code was nowhere to be found in the app. I stated that fact and it politely agreed, and then added the new code. So clearly there is a lot of room for improvement but this is already far more than it could do 8 months ago.

It's the anticipation of AI making jobs obsolete that is causing CEOs to refuse to fill these positions, despite their obvious needs. That, and trying to fill senior level positions with inexperienced overseas junior developers (which has been going on forever).
The thing they miss, of course, is that AI can only answer questions. It really can't proactively figure out business needs. Further, most AI has only limited input prompts. Meaning, whatever its original output is (even if correct), must be understood by humans for further modifications to be made. There also still remains a large quality gap in what it produces. Much like what junior coders from overseas diploma mills churn out, the quality of AI code always needs to be double-checked by people capable of doing so.
But customers (meaning CEOs of technology companies) never get what they actually need, only what they think they want. So we are where we are until they learn another harsh lesson.
It's the anticipation of AI making jobs obsolete that is causing CEOs to refuse to fill these positions, despite their obvious needs. That, and trying to fill senior level positions with inexperienced overseas junior developers (which has been going on forever).I think this is closer to the mark though their reasoning is more rational than you imply.LLMs are the start of a big disruption, we've seen the ChatGPT assistant, but we haven't really seen what it looks like to have the LLM integrated into a specially designed application.So the CEOs are doing one of two things (possibly both):1) Getting some folks working on LLM apps internally so see if they can create one of those next gen LLM apps.2) Keeping their power dry by downsizing ahead of time. Make sure you have a lot of cash on hand when you know what to hire for and the kind of dev you need to hire.

Companies are laying off everywhere, but we still keep bringing in indentured servants. Positions go to the person willing to work cheapest, capable of offering the least push-back.
Maybe AI is causing layoffs.  But probably not.  As James Carville might say, ""It's the pandemic, stupid!""  Overhiring during the pandemic is now being corrected.  It didn't make sense to hire like crazy during the pandemic, and we're seeing the consequences of that hiring binge.  Once that correction is finished, then we'll see what type of effect AI is having.  But right now, the pandemic correction far outweighs the effects of AI.
We're a ways off before anyone replaces productive works with AI and still turns a profit.
IT job market waxes and wanes in tesponse to our industry's poor business planning combined with a bursts of easy capital from foolish investors into moronic startup ideas.
I'm waiting for companies to grow a little more sane. I think I speak for a lot of programmers that we don't want to spend our time shoving AI shit into every product because the CEO or stakeholders think it's a good idea.

There are reportedly many factors that figure to shape the trade market for Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Cooper Kupp this offseason.
According to Dianna Russini of The Athletic, Kupp's market is ""complicated"" because of his age, injury history and contract.
Kupp, who will turn 32 in June, announced last week on X that the Rams informed him they intend to trade him during the offseason:
I was informed that the team will be seeking a trade immediately and will be working with me and my family to find the right place to continue competing for championships. I don't agree with the decision and always believed it was going to begin and end in LA. <br><br>Still, if there's… <a href=""https://t.co/XWmbGVscGy"">pic.twitter.com/XWmbGVscGy</a>
Originally a third-round pick out of Eastern Washington in 2017, Kupp has spent his entire eight-year NFL career with the Rams, and he ranks third in franchise history in receptions (634), fourth in receiving yardage (7,776) and third in receiving touchdowns (57).
Kupp is best remembered for his legendary 2021 season when he was named Offensive Player of the Year and won the receiving Triple Crown with 145 catches for 1,947 yards and 16 touchdowns.
He topped off arguably the greatest season by a wideout in NFL history by winning Super Bowl MVP honors in the Rams' Super Bowl win over the Cincinnati Bengals.
However, since then, Kupp has missed a total of 18 games over the past three seasons due to injury, and he has averaged 67 catches for 753 yards and six touchdowns per year.
Had he stayed healthy, Kupp likely would have eclipsed 1,000 yards or at least come close to it in each season, but durability is undoubtedly a concern considering his advancing age.
Also worth considering is the fact that Kupp is signed for two more seasons at a salary cap hit of $29.78 million in 2025 and $27.33 million in 2026.
Per ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, $15 million of the $20 million Kupp is due in 2025 is guaranteed via a roster bonus as well.
Despite the numerous concerns, Russini reported that the Rams have already received calls on Kupp and things could move quickly with a deal likely to be struck at some point before March 14.
Fowler reported that the Rams are expected to eat at least some of Kupp's contract, which could make him easier to move and improve the draft capital L.A. can get in return.
For all the risks that come along with Kupp, he remains one of the best route runners and more sure-handed receivers in the game, and he could be a true difference-maker for any team that acquires him if he is able to largely stay healthy in 2025."

        Days after President Trump signed executive orders to shake up the federal workforce, DOGE was asking some federal workers which colleagues could be fired, targeting DEI, and encouraging employees who took the payout to move to the private sector.
    

        The effort to remake the federal workforce has faced backlash, including a slew of lawsuits that has put some early actions in limbo. Amid the shifting patchwork of directives, pushback, and official guidance, federal employees are left scrambling.
    

Inside the first 17 days.


        First came the self-starters. Then there were disruptors. Now, Silicon Valley has a new favorite buzzy term: high agency.
    

        Over the past year, high agency has become the aspirational trait of enterprising tech workers. The analytics site Brandwatch found a 500% jump in usage of the phrase across X, Reddit, and other social media sites. It's no coincidence being high agency is in right now, with Elon Musk bringing tech philosophies to the federal government.
    

But is it really different than its predecessors?


        Over the course of its 16-year existence, the Beast earned a reputation for its scrappy reporting — but it wasn't profitable. In 2024, longtime media executives Joanna Coles and Ben Sherwood were hired as co-owners.
    

        After taking over, Sherwood told staff the media outlet was on track to lose $9 million that year. Since ""Boanna,"" the media outlet is now profitable for the first time in its history. Its content has also been lighter on the hard-hitting journalism it was once known for, though its new leaders say they plan to do more investigative work.
    

Our reporters take you inside the ups and downs of the turnaround effort.


        Employers like Amazon, AT&T, and even the federal government are herding employees back to their desks with RTO mandates, causing chaos in the housing market. Some workers have to ditch the houses they bought during the peak of remote work.
    

        It's also not an ideal time to sell a house, thanks to high mortgage rates and weaker demand, especially in the South. Many would-be sellers are becoming ""accidental landlords"" instead and renting out their properties.
    

Being a landlord isn't easy, either.


This week's quote:


        ""The sports gambling industry has cultivated an entirely new market. And we're just beginning to see the social effects.""

13,2025-02-09,"Nathan Lowe (left) was recalled to Stoke City from his loan at Walsall after Leicester did the same to Tom Cannon
For a stark reminder of the fragilities of operating in the loan market you need only look at how decisions made at Portman Road on deadline day resonated from the Premier League down through the divisions into the National League.
The money Ipswich Town spent on West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper Alex Palmer led the Baggies to recall Josh Griffiths from his loan at Bristol Rovers and, in turn, forced the League One club to bring Jed Ward back prematurely from his temporary stay at Forest Green Rovers.
Three clubs lost their starting goalkeeper, all among their standout individuals of the season, with little room to manoeuvre and pivot to something else, because of one transfer at the top of the food chain.
It maybe should not come as a surprise but does highlight a pretty significant fault line when working in such a market, albeit one where the English Football League and non-league clubs simply have no choice given the financial pressures and the comparative low cost to high return of loaning a player in - even with the sporting risks.
The chain reaction of the Palmer deal was right at the end of the window - in the weeks leading up to that there were other such examples of regrettable recalls which could prove to have undeniable impact on those at the wrong end of it. 
Not falling in love with a loan player has never been easier.
Leicester City's decision to recall Tom Cannon from Stoke City was different in that there was never any indication he was going start for the Foxes in the Premier League and his return to the King Power Stadium proved a brief one as he was sold to Sheffield United to aid PSR concerns.
Stoke, now a striker short and having paid a significant fee and wage contribution to loan Cannon in the first place, turned to one of their own to fill the void in Nathan Lowe, who had found the target 15 times in 22 games for League Two leaders Walsall, bringing the 19-year-old back early from Bescot Stadium.
In League One, Stockport County have been undoubted beneficiaries of Louie Barry's talents, scoring 25 goals in 47 appearances over two spells on hire from Aston Villa.
But with his star rising, the Premier League club elected to exercise their clause and place him in the Championship at Hull City.
In League Two, Cardiff City's Joel Colwill was Cheltenham Town's joint top scorer, finding the target six times as the Robins stablished themselves in mid-table for a second half of the season tilt towards the play-offs. 
Such an ambition may have to be slightly tempered as the 20-year-old was called back to Wales before being placed a division higher at Exeter City.
Cardiff's Joel Colwill scored six goals and added three assists in 22 appearances for Cheltenham
As was the case for struggling Accrington Stanley, with Burnley electing to move Dara Costelloe from a relegation battle in the fourth tier to one a level up at Northampton Town.
""There's no loyalty,"" Cheltenham director of football Gary Johnson tells BBC Sport with a knowing smirk.
During his near 40-year career in the dugout with Cambridge United, Yeovil Town and Bristol City he struggles to calculate how many players he's loaned, but an estimate would be comfortably into triple figures.
""It's tricky and you'll win some, and lose some,"" he said. 
""We got Colwill games, played him every week when he was available, and he did very well and we were sorry to lose him but Cardiff decided to bring him back and send him to Exeter.
""We're just pleased we were able to help Cardiff show he was a decent player - he helped up get a lot of points, some good wins and helped put us in a position where we're not having to panic at this stage of the season.""
As Johnson well knows, there is something far more calculated to the entire process now; every Premier League club has a loans manager or at least a committee whose job is to ensure academy talent or senior players not playing can be relocated to either aid their development or help ease numbers in the first team.
Whereas recalls previously tended to happen, and the vast majority still do, when a player isn't receiving sufficient game time, the very specific plan around each individual is such that the clubs who take them on essentially become victims of their own success.
""It's changed a lot. It's gone from getting players out who aren't playing for certain periods of time - one month, three months, six months - to something more strategic,"" said Rob Newman, the former head of recruitment at West Ham who also spent 12 years in Manchester City's international scouting department.
""If they're playing well in the under-21s and they're 18, 19, you come to the conclusion that they need men's football. Is it suitable for the lad to go out? 
""Because if he's going to crumble under it, then it's pointless, so you're looking at putting him into an environment where he's going to adapt well, so clubs are naturally careful.
""Clubs, say, in League One and League Two, will come in with presentations to showcase how they're going to play, how they'd fit a player into that, what they want him to do etc.
""Don't get me wrong, there are still some out there who may have personal connections at Premier League clubs and will ring to ask, 'have you got a striker?' just to get a body in. 
""But, for the most part, there's quite an extensive due diligence process from both the loaning club and those receiving the player.""
Louie Barry starred for Stockport in League One and League Two and is now on loan at Hull City in the Championship
Beyond the concept of player development there is also a financial consideration as loans departments have financial goals, which drives such moves as Cannon and George Edmundson's Middlesbrough move, with Leicester and Ipswich ultimately able to make profits on players not part of the first-team picture.
""A player will accrue more value playing in the Championship, League One or League Two than they will in the under-21s â that's just a fact,"" Newman adds.
In the cases of Barry and Colwill, the decision to move them up does seem to be rooted in challenging them at higher levels and answering a question for their parent clubs - can they cut it? 
Should Barry perform in the Championship, he starts to enter the first-team conversation at Villa or, next-best case scenario, becomes more an appealing asset in the summer transfer market.
It's not solely the clubs driving it, though, as Johnson adds: ""If you've got a good relationship with the club, they know they're being looked after, getting good training, good advice, good welfare, you've put them in a nice place to live and they're happy, there's every chance they will stay.
""But then you get the other part, with the agent, and they might want him to move on because he's doing well and they start contacting other clubs with January coming up.
""This is the difference - the agents now have a big say whether they want the player to go to a certain club or not. It's changed a little bit who decides.""
Portsmouth have been afforded consistency in terms of midfielder Freddie Potts, who has started 24 league games since signing from West Ham and will finish the campaign at Fratton Park.
""We'd have been disappointed if West Ham had turned around late in the day and said, 'we are going to recall Freddie' but we have a really good relationship with them and spoke to them about the likelihood of that,"" manager John Mousinho said.
""You can't properly plan for it. You do have to take a view. 
""We're looking constantly at how a player's doing and whether they're going to be recalled for a number of factors; some of them do take you by surprise.
""We would actually only ever plan for a player to be here until January and then have some contingency under that but once the deadline passes you plan for the rest of the year.""
Freddie Potts (right) has made two senior appearances for West Ham
Despite the pitfalls and the inability to plan sufficiently beyond January, EFL clubs have little option but to continue to mine the loan market and play the game. Ultimately, not doing so makes life so much harder.
There is also a wider picture to consider, sometimes a loan of a player can be a stepping stone to an even better one further down the line, should trust be sufficiently built.
Money still talks in many ways, when it comes to the Championship attracting the best Premier League Under-21 talent with the need to pay a substantial loan fee, but so do previous relationships.
For Walsall, who since Lowe left have won just one of five games, there is an understandable licking of wounds but ultimately he helped put them in the position they now occupy and long-term has helped create and enhance boss Mat Sadler and the club's reputation as somewhere clubs can send their players for development.
As has been proven with Manchester United sending striker Ethan Wheatley to Bescot Stadium, and Stoke loaning them a second player in midfielder Darius Lipsiuc.
""In any shape or form, that was a fantastic loan for us; 30 games, and the productivity of that was brilliant,"" Sadler said of Lowe.
""Now we have to find the next one â that's football, that's life. I've got no problem with that. I love the fact that we have a part of Nathan's journey and, as a football club, that's how we work and operate.
""What we'll try to do now is be a place where people want to send their players, which I don't think has been the case always.
""I don't see it as an evil, I see it as brilliant â he's done well, now we have to get on with the next one.""

I've tested just about every high-end blow dryer and styling tool on the market, hoping to accomplish a salon-worthy blowout at home, but my results always seem to fall flat (literally). I have thin hair that just never holds a DIY bounce.
With this in mind, I was skeptical that the Bondi Boost Infrared Bounce Brush would do much for my flat yet frizzy mane, but my results speak for themselves. 
This brush gives me the bounciest, smoothest style I've ever achieved at home—all while causing less heat damage to the hair than traditional hot tools.
After selling out twice since the initial launch, the Infrared Bounce Brush is finally back in stock. Keep reading to learn why you need to secure this brush for your hairstyling arsenal before it's sold out again.
Bondi Boost Infrared Bounce Brush
It's important to note that the Bondi Boost Infrared Bounce Brush is not a blow dryer but rather a styler for dry hair. Instead of releasing hot air, the brush uses infrared heat to warm strands and lock in your style.
This infrared technology is paired with the brand's signature aloe-infused bristles, which add shine and reduce frizz without depositing product on your strands. That means every pass through your hair with the 42-mm barrel adds instant sheen and volume while also locking a bouncy curl.
Just as sleek as my final look, the tool also keeps settings to a minimum. It has a main power button and two additional smaller buttons to increase or decrease the temperature. 
I'm not embellishing when I say this Bounce Brush gives me the post-salon look that I've chased after for years. The first time I used it, I received countless compliments from friends who were sure I'd come straight from a hair appointment. 
When I style my hair with the hot tool, my results mimic a sleek blowout perfectly but take less than 10 minutes. And if you haven't caught on—I'm not a hair pro.
In fact, I'd argue this $98 brush is the perfect investment for beginners. Styling with it is almost foolproof, and there's even a cool tip to prevent you from burning your hand (a common casualty with my curling iron).
Plus, the brush turns off automatically after 60 minutes. I've definitely relied on this fail-safe on busy mornings when I'm convinced that I forgot to turn it off.
Of course, I also love knowing that infrared technology causes less damage to my hair. With that in mind, I know any heat can cause damage—so I always use the brand's protectant spray.
On the topic of heat damage, Bondi Boost claims the device doesn't cause any—but the reality is a little more complex.
Although a ""more gentle way for heat application,"" per Stephanie Angelone, master stylist at RPZL in NYC, infrared technology still does use heat. No matter which way you break it down, there are going to be side effects from heat application to your hair—but the tech does come with other benefits.
Angelone previously told mindbodygreen that the more even distribution and deeper penetration of infrared heat results in less frizz. Trichologist Kerry Yates, founder of Colour Collective, adds that infrared hot tools tend to style the hair faster, which means less damage to your strands.
What's more, trichologist Bridgette Hill has personally seen results with clients who use entry-level red light tools at home, adding that this technology can be beneficial for respecting the integrity of the hair fiber and the scalp's microbiome.
RELATED: Love a Sleek Blow-Dry but Don't Want Heat Damage? This May Be the Antidote
Again, this brush is designed for dry hair. Once you've turned it on and toggled to your desired temperature, you'll want to go over your hair in sections.
For a sleek, bouncy style, simply wrap your hair around the brush and slowly glide it down, curling inward at the ends. For more volume, you'll just place the brush under your hair at the rules and hold it there for 10 to 15 seconds, again slowly gliding down to the ends.
You can even use the brush to achieve a wavy look, by wrapping your hair around it, holding for 10 to 15 seconds, and then twisting your hair into loose waves. When testing the brush, I opted for a smooth style with bouncy waves at the end.
Maybe one day there will be a styling tool that uses no heat whatsoever, but until then, this infrared brush certainly seems like a worthy stand-in. There's not much I'd change about its design (and nothing I'd change about my results).
One small annoyance is that the power button is located in a place where my thumb seems to constantly press it while using the brush. Fortunately, there's an auto-lock feature that stops the brush from turning off—so this doesn't interfere with my styling.
Bondi Boost Infrared Bounce Brush
This $98 brush costs less than most professional styling services (at least for us New York City residents)—and the results are just as good, if not better. 
Plus, the infrared technology puts far less damage on your hair than other at-home tools. I'm willing to bet the brand's most recent restock won't last long, so I wouldn't wait to place your order.

17,2025-02-09,"Business Insider Edition 
Some people using GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic for weight loss have a problem: Eggs are suddenly expensive and hard to find.

Eggs aren't just big with fitness fans and Gaston from ""Beauty and the Beast."" They're a logical protein option for people taking Ozempic, Wegovy, or similar medications, said Amanda Oren, vice president of industry strategy for grocery in North America at Relex, a supply-chain platform. Moreover, they naturally contain little fat, salt, or sugar — good for weight loss plans.
    

        They're one of the foods that GLP-1 users buy more of than people not on the medication, according to a December report by market research provider Circana. The report found GLP-1 takers buy fewer fatty proteins — think big, greasy burgers, for instance, and less alcohol and salty snacks.
    

        Many users — 49% — said in December that their households spent less on food after they started taking the drug, according to a survey conducted by Purdue University. Users generally have lower appetites and eat less.
    

        When they are buying food, ""it's eggs, and it's the meat and seafood departments that have seen the bump"" in sales, Oren said.
    

        But egg fans — whether on weigh-loss meds or not — are taking a big financial hit right now, thanks to the spread of avian influenza among egg-laying chickens in the US. The disease has led farms to cull their flocks and cut back production. In January, the US had 8% fewer egg-laying hens than it did three years earlier, a CoBank report published on Thursday found.
    

        While avian flu has been hitting egg production in the US for a few years, prices have spiked recently. As of January 30 the cost of a dozen Midwest large eggs was $7.08, according to the US Department of Agriculture. That's up from $1.65 three years earlier.
    

        Retailers and restaurants have reacted. Diner chain Waffle House cited avian flu on Monday as it added a 50-cent surcharge to each egg it sells. Grocery store Aldi has limited customers to buying two dozen eggs at once at some stores.
    

        Another factor: Two laws, one in Colorado and another in Michigan, took effect on January 1 and require all eggs sold in the states to be from cage-free farms. Some suppliers weren't ready for the switch, which has contributed to shortages, Oren said.
    

        ""All of these different factors of increasing demand, and then multiple factors decreasing supply, has led to what I would call a perfect storm,"" she said.
    

        High egg prices are likely to stick around, according to CoBank. A solution to avian flu isn't obvious. Demand, meanwhile, is about to take a seasonal step up, with Easter falling on April 20. Projections from the US Department of Agriculture suggest that prices could start falling in the second quarter of 2025, however.
    

        Fortunately, people taking GLP-1s have other protein choices, Relex's Oren said.
    

        Besides meat options — think chicken breasts — the number of lean, meat-free protein options has multiplied in recent years, she said. The options vary from long-established options like tofu to Just Egg, a mung bean-based egg substitute that previously advertised itself as avian flu-proof.
    

        ""There are a lot more alternatives today than there used to be,"" Oren said.
    

        US consumers have another option, said Joseph Balagtas, director of the Center for Food Demand at Purdue University: They can keep eating eggs — and eat the price increases.
    

        Even for GLP-1 users, eggs make up a small amount of shoppers' total grocery budgets. That, plus the fact that there are fewer good substitutes for some uses of eggs, such as in baking, means that many people are likely to continue buying.
    

        ""Many Americans are lucky enough to earn enough where it hurts, but not very much,"" Balagtas said. ""So I don't reduce my consumption very much.""

Spring training officially begins today when the Chicago Cubs open their camp at Mesa, Ariz.
Yet there are still some recognizable hitters on the free agent market, a list goes beyond Alex Bregman, the best player remaining.
Bregman is still in play more three months after filing for free agency and a year after being the American League Gold Glove third baseman. Bregman has spent his entire nine-year career with the Astros and Houston is still reportedly in the running to re-sign him after offering him a six-year, $156-million contract in November.
Other teams linked to Bregman include the Boston Red Sox, Chicago Cubs, Detroit Tigers and Toronto Blue Jays.
Bregman had a 4.1-bWAR season in 2024, his lowest mark since 2021. In addition to the Gold Glove, the 30-year-old hit .260/.315/.453 with 26 home runs in 145 games. His career slash line is .272/.366/.483 in 4,832 plate appearances.
Beyond Bregman, the free-agent hitting market includes three players who appeared in last year’s World Series – first baseman Anthony Rizzo and outfielder Alex Verdugo with the New York Yankees and utility player Kike Hernandez with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Infielder Jose Iglesias is unsigned despite being a key player and spiritual leader for the New York Mets last season when they reached the National League Championship Series before losing to the Dodgers.
Rizzo and Verdugo are coming off down years, which is why the Yankees signed Paul Goldschmidt as a free agent to replace Rizzo and are going with rookie Jasson Dominguez in left field to take Verdugo’s place.
Rizzo, 35, will almost certainly have to take a big pay cut from his 2024 salary of $17 million. He hit .228/.301/.335 in 92 games with eight home runs and 0.2 bWAR.
Verdugo, 28, struggled in his lone season with the Yankees as he batted .233/.291/.356 with 13 homers in 149 games. His 0.8 bWAR was the lowest in a full season during his eight-year career.
Rizzo went 8 for 30 (.267) with a double in postseason play last year, including 2 for 16 in the World Series. Verdugo hit .208 (10 for 48) in the playoffs with one home run.
Hernandez, 33, helped the Dodgers win it all a year ago when he slashed .229/.281/.373 over 126 regular-season games with 12 homers and 1.3 bWAR. In the postseason, he was 15 for 51 (.294) with two longballs,
Versatility adds to Hernandez’s attractiveness. He played every position but catcher and right fielder last year while making four appearances as a relief pitcher.
Iglesias was one of the biggest surprises in the major leagues last season when he shined for the Mets after spending all of 2024 in the minor leagues. Called up from Triple-A on May 31, Iglesias had a .337/.381/.448 slash line with four home runs in 118 games.
His 3.1 bWAR was second on the team to the 6.9 of shortstop Francisco Lindor, who was the runner-up in NL MVP voting.
However, Iglesias might most be remembered for his hit song OMG – recorded under his stage name of Candelita – becoming the Mets’ rally cry.

19,2025-02-09,"OnePlus has a lot of different things in the oven right now, and a newly-leaked roadmap suggests there could be a new device in April, May, October, and November. The leak comes via Oneline Technology on Weibo and seems to confirm several expected launches, including the OnePlus 13 Mini as the OnePlus 13T.
The post lists the four devices as the OnePlus 13T, the Ace 5S, the OnePlus 14, and the OnePlus Ace 6 and Ace 6 Pro. The tipster says the products are “temporarily” named and are likely to change, so the exact names aren’t yet confirmed. If the company does go with the 13T naming scheme, it will be the first time since the OnePlus 10T released in 2022.
As a side note, the OnePlus Open 2 isn’t listed as one of the upcoming releases (though most estimates place the launch sometime around May.)
That doesn’t mean the OnePlus Open 2 isn’t launching. The list covers phones expected to launch in China this year, and the OnePlus Open 2 is thought to the global variant of the Oppo Find N5. As a result, OnePlus wouldn’t include it here; the OnePlus Open 2 would be the name given the device on the global stage, not in the Chinese market.
The post also provides a few details about the devices. It suggests OnePlus will make a change to the physical three-stage button, converting into something like the Action Button found on modern iPhones.
As always, take this information with a grain of salt. Oneline Technology has a reliable history with insider knowledge, but until OnePlus makes an official statement, the names and information could (and is likely to) change.
Merely days after releasing a major software update for its latest flagship, OnePlus has begun the rollout of another incremental patch for its new flagship phone. The OxygenOS 15.0.0.405 build, which is now headed to OnePlus 13 users in all major markets, brings a bunch of practical AI upgrades, among other feature tweaks.
The focus of these AI upgrades is mostly on refining the translation experience. For example, the phone will show the live-translated speech in real time on the screen. Taking a leaf out of Samsung’s Galaxy AI book, the latest update also brings a “face-to-face translation feature.”
The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is going to be my primary smartphone for at least the next few weeks, and I’m coming to it from the OnePlus 13. I first put my SIM card in the OnePlus 13 three months ago, and no one has been able to wrestle it from my hands since. For me, this is an astonishingly long time to use an Android phone, and it speaks volumes about what a superb phone it is.
I'll be using the Galaxy S25 Ultra for the next few weeks, but I'm going to miss the OnePlus 13. Here's why.
Why so long?
The OnePlus Open 2 promises to be an incredibly slender device, perhaps even the thinnest phone ever made. Leaks earlier in the year suggested a thickness of just 9.2mm, and now an image shared by Oppo executive Billy Zhang gives us a look at just how slim the phone actually is.
The Oppo Find N5 — believed to have a virtually identical design to the OnePlus Open 2 — is smaller than the iPad Pro, a device that is 5.3mm thick. While folded, the OnePlus Open 2 is said to be less than 9.2mm, and somewhere under five when unfolded with a weight of less than 219 grams.

	Two months after the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson sent shockwaves through the much-reviled U.S. health insurance industry, the company’s parent, UnitedHealth Group, is making aggressive moves to protect its image.

	Responding to a slew of attacks online, often coupled with the glorification of Luigi Mangione (who was charged with Thompson’s murder outside a Midtown Manhattan hotel in December, and allegedly wrote a short manifesto calling health insurers “parasites”), the company has hired a law firm that specializes in defamation cases. Clare Locke, the Virginia-based practice, previously represented Dominion Voting Systems in a bombshell defamation suit that saw Fox News pay a settlement of $787.5 million for airing false allegations about the company’s supposed role in voter fraud during the 2020 election.

	UnitedHealth appears eager to make a similar example of Elisabeth Potter, an Austin, Texas, plastic surgeon, and is accusing the doctor of “using her social media following to perpetuate inaccuracies, which is irresponsible, unethical and dangerous.” On Jan. 7, Potter posted a video on Instagram sharing her frustration with the U.S. insurance system, explaining in a text caption that during a procedure, “I was interrupted by a call from United Healthcare — while the patient was already asleep on the operating table. They demanded information about her diagnosis and inpatient stay justification. I had to scrub out mid-surgery to call United, only to find that the person on the line didn’t even have access to the patient’s full medical information, despite the procedure already being pre-approved.” 

	










	“It’s beyond frustrating and, frankly, unacceptable,” Potter continued. “We should be focused on care, not bureaucracy.” The comments were rife with fury at UniteHealthcare and for-profit health insurance more broadly. “Luigi for President,” wrote one person, while another put in, “One day these health insurance companies will be dead.”

	Days later, according to reporting from Bloomberg, Potter’s attorney received a letter from Clare Locke instructing her to amend the post, apologize, and disavow threats of violence that UnitedHealth claimed had stemmed from the video. But Potter’s legal counsel, Jessica Underwood, has said that there is nothing inaccurate in the video that needs correcting. “Dr. Potter will not be silenced by UnitedHealthcare’s attempts to threaten and harass her,” Underwood has said. The company, meanwhile, has argued that “Dr. Potter’s claims that she was called out of surgery are false.” Potter’s Instagram video remains up on the platform, where it has received more than 350,000 likes.

	










	Elsewhere, UnitedHealth took measures to prevent the dissemination of internal data about its denials of customer claims. (UnitedHealth Group’s individual market plans are known to have one of the highest denial rates among all U.S. insurers, a fact that received much media attention in the wake of Thompson’s death.) As The Lever reported, a day after President Donald Trump‘s inauguration in January, UnitedHealth submitted a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission asking for approval to block a shareholder proposal that it use a third-party auditor to assess “previous customer denial claims, particularly where a death was involved, to determine if denial letters included factually incorrect and insensitive information.” In cases where this outside analyst determined that a coverage claim should not have been denied, the proposal says, those individuals and family members affected are to be sent an apology letter hand-signed by both a UnitedHealth executive and a member of the company’s board of directors.

	UnitedHealth’s rationale for refusing a vote on such a policy, as its legal team wrote in the letter, is that the proposal was not submitted before “the applicable deadline.”

	Then, on Jan. 31, the insurer sent a second letter to the SEC, seeking to prevent a shareholder vote on another proposal related to its claim denials. This proposal, if passed by investors, would recommend that UnitedHealth “evaluate how company practices impact access to health care and patient outcomes, including analyses of how often prior authorization requirements or denials of coverage lead to delay or abandonment of medical treatment and serious adverse events for patients.” The report produced through this review is also intended to encompass “the public health-related costs and macroeconomic risks created by the company’s practices that limit or delay access to health care.”

	In their letter, UniteHealth rejected the notion of putting this proposal to a shareholder vote because it is “vague and indefinite,” and, it argued, an attempt to “impermissibly micromanage” the company.

	The insurance giant’s attempts to police social media chatter about its business practices and its overtures to Trump’s SEC dovetailed earlier this week when hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman shared his opinion of the company’s future. “If I still shorted stocks, I would short United Healthcare,” he posted to X on Tuesday, adding that the SEC “should do a thorough investigation of the company.” He further mused, “I would not be surprised to find that the company’s profitability is massively overstated due to its denial of medically necessary procedures and patient care.” 



	Ackman later deleted the speculation, but UnitedHealth flagged his comments to the SEC for potential investigation. The company’s stock price dipped the following day, and ended the week about 2.7 percent lower than it was on Tuesday. “Health insurance has long been subject to significant regulatory oversight and earnings caps,” UnitedHealth said in a statement responding to the outspoken investor, one of many ultra-wealthy figures to back Trump in 2024 and post prolifically on social media about how only the MAGA movement could save the country. “Any claims that health insurers, which typically have low- to mid-single digit margins, can somehow over-earn are grossly uninformed about the structure and strong regulatory oversight of the sector,” the company noted.

	










	All told, UnitedHealth is mounting a far stronger defense of its reputation than it two months ago, when Thompson’s slaying unleashed a flood of hostility that caught it somewhat off-guard. Now, the company looks like it’s prepared to grind it out as Mangione’s parallel state and federal trials get underway, with heated rhetoric likely to flare up once again.

When Google announced that it would be replacing the Assistant with Gemini, I braced for what I assumed would be the inevitable: a feature-rich experience marred by a frustrating transition period. Almost exactly one year later, however, the transition has actually gone smoother than I expected. Setting reminders and controlling smart home devices now work, and I haven’t found myself completely lost without the old Google Assistant. But while Gemini hasn’t been the disaster I feared, I can’t say it’s a clear upgrade either.
For all of Google’s promises about deeper reasoning and higher-quality responses, I feel like there’s very little that Gemini can do that Assistant couldn’t. So when I learned that AI startup Perplexity was stepping up to offer an alternative, I was immediately curious to see how it compared to Google’s old and new assistants. And after a week of use, I can confidently say that I won’t be returning to Gemini anytime soon.
As I mentioned earlier, Gemini’s numerous extensions mean that it can now control my smart home and take notes. However, it fails just as miserably at answering questions as the outgoing Google Assistant. My main gripe with Gemini stems from how much it relies on the underlying large language model (and its personal knowledge) to answer my queries instead of using its built-in search engine.
Case in point, I routinely ask Gemini for stock prices and get variable results that frustrate me to no end. A prompt like “How is Apple’s stock price doing?” once yielded a vague response about the company’s financial performance over the past few months, but crucially, didn’t deliver a price quote at all.
It wasn’t until I specifically asked “What is Apple’s stock price?” that Gemini finally gave me a definitive answer. And even then, it linked me to three other websites and lectured me on the volatility of stock prices.
Perplexity, meanwhile, responds to such queries with a rich information box that even contains an interactive chart. Take a look for yourself.
This isn’t a one-off, I’ve run into the same problem when trying to convert currencies on multiple occasions. Ask Gemini how much 100 USD is in Euros, and you’re more likely to get a disclaimer about exchange rate fluctuations than an actual number. If the stars align, you might get an answer but it might just be faster to use Google Search instead.
Perplexity, on the other hand, does exactly what I want from an assistant: it pulls real-time exchange rates from multiple sources and clearly presents them, albeit without the pretty charts this time. More importantly, though, it performs this task consistently every single time.
Next, I asked both assistants, “Where can I watch the re-release of Interstellar this weekend?” Here, Gemini did exactly what I’d expect the decade-old Google Assistant to do: it flat out refused to look for an answer. It’s quite an embarrassing result, to say the least.
Meanwhile, Perplexity performed a quick search and analyzed eight sources to offer a release date and recommendations on how to book tickets. From here, I simply used Google’s Circle to Search and navigated to one of the booking websites myself. Is Perplexity’s response perfect? Not at all, but it’s a big step up over Gemini.
While most competing digital assistants on Android stop at answering questions, that’s not the case with Perplexity. Like Gemini, you can ask it to perform a handful of phone-related tasks like send a text message or email, call a contact, and open an app. It can also play music via Spotify and set reminders.
Impressively, Perplexity can understand vague instructions like “Remind me to watch the next season of The White Lotus when it releases.” Here, you’d expect the assistant to look for the show’s release date first and set a reminder accordingly and that’s exactly what Perplexity does.
When I tried the same prompt with Gemini, I was horrified to find that it simply set up a task with the entire text instead of following the instructions at the end. This is the kind of inconsistency that makes Google’s AI experience so frustrating to live with and potentially dangerous if you rely on it for anything important.
Perplexity can also perform multiple tasks at once, similar to Gemini’s multi-extension functionality that Samsung showcased at the recent Galaxy S25 launch event. For example, it can find nearby Thai restaurants and set a reminder to book a table at one later.
On that note, Perplexity has a couple of cool tricks up its sleeve. For one, you can ask it to book a table and it will bring you to the restaurant’s OpenTable page to set up a reservation. Likewise, you can book an Uber ride using just your voice — I tested it with the prompt “Get me a ride to the airport” and it worked as expected. Perplexity has a surprisingly good handle at localized suggestions too. It managed to give me directions to the nearest coffee shop (a non-chain location at that) and booking a cab to the spot was just another voice command away.
Finally, Perplexity can also read the contents of your screen when required. This means you can instruct it to do things like summarize the contents of your screen and then send the result as an email to a friend. Or as I tend to use it the most, translate a foreign language. Gemini has offered this feature for a while now, so I’m glad I didn’t lose it when I switched to Perplexity Assistant.
Perplexity may have the upper hand in some areas, but it’s not exactly equal to Gemini yet either. Unlike Perplexity, Google’s assistant can read your emails, access files from Drive, and integrate more seamlessly with services like Tasks and Assistant Routines. The closest Perplexity can get to reading your inbox is summarizing your notifications, which is helpful but nowhere near as powerful.
Another key difference is how you invoke each assistant. Gemini supports a wake word for hands-free activation, whereas Perplexity requires holding down the power button or using a diagonal swipe gesture. I personally don’t mind this since I’m usually holding my phone when I need assistance, but it’s a notable limitation nonetheless. Perplexity also lacks any smart home controls at the moment — though that might not be a dealbreaker if you already own smart speakers.
The one missing piece that might be harder to ignore is calendar integration. As of now, Perplexity can’t link to a calendar, meaning you can’t check or add events. This is an easily solved problem over time, though, as plenty of other apps allow you to link your Google account for calendar and Drive access.
With these downsides then, should you switch to Perplexity? It comes down to what you need from your phone’s digital assistant. If your priority is getting answers to questions reliably, no matter how vaguely worded, Perplexity is the superior choice without a doubt. But if you need your assistant to interface directly with your digital life, Gemini holds the edge for the time being.
For now, I’ve made my switch, and I don’t regret it. Gemini could appreciably improve in the future, but Perplexity does everything I need and then some. More than anything, I’m just glad there’s real competition in this space. After all, it was only a few years ago that the stagnating Google Assistant was the only viable option."

Apple always promotes the HomePod as a powerful music player
Eight months after it was first announced, Apple's first HomePods began shipping on February 9, 2018 —  and started a peculiar journey of life, death, and resurrection. There's been a subtle but fundamental change about the HomePod since it was first launched, and especially since it was first rumored. But it isn't a technical change, it's an alteration in how we've come round to thinking of it the way Apple always wanted us to.Today, the HomePod sits in a range of Apple audio devices that includes the later HomePod mini, but also the whole AirPods range. The HomePod is a speaker, and if Apple doesn't make the absolute finest and greatest audio equipment, it certainly makes the most.Flash back to the launch in June 2017, though, and a little further to the rumors that began around 2014, and HomePod wasn't a music speaker. It was a smart speaker, it was Apple's answer to Amazon's Alexa.We expected a Siri Speaker, and Apple was falling behind.The first rumorsThe Amazon Echo, the first Amazon speaker to feature the Alexa voice assistant, had been launched in 2014. Originally released to just Amazon Prime subscribers, by 2015 it seemed to be everywhere, and so Apple seemed to be nowhere.Apple had acquired Siri and included it in the iPhone 4s back in 2011. Yet despite leading the way with digital assistants, in just those first few years, Siri was already being seen as eclipsed by its rivals.In 2014, the rumors were starting that something was going to be done about this, and specifically that Apple would enter the smart home space. When WWDC 2014 came in June that year, it was true, Apple launched HomeKit and a push into the smart home —  but not a speaker.But then just shortly afterwards in August 2014, Apple acquired Beats. At $3 billion, it was and remains Apple's largest ever acquisition of another company, and you don't spend that money on an audio company without a plan. Beats Pill+ was Apple's first speaker after acquiring BeatsIt just didn't seem as if a Siri Speaker were part of it. In 2015, though, Apple launched its first Bluetooth speaker under the Beats brand. Called the Beats Pill+, this $230 portable speaker introduced charging via Lightning —  and did not introduce Siri.Instead, while the launch seemed to confirm rumors that there would be a Beats-branded Siri Speaker soon, Apple and Beats concentrated on audio quality.""When you obsess about sound the way that we do at Beats, portable Bluetooth speakers can be very tricky,"" said Beats President Luke Wood at the time. ""We spent countless days, weeks, months testing for that perfect combination of form and function - small enough to travel but still big enough to feel the emotion of the music. That's what you get with Pill+.""Apple isn't interestedThen as now, Apple will not budge on its secrecy. But also then as now, Apple does find a way to make its position known —  and it does have to comply with regulatory filings.So in 2017, Apple was letting the world know that it wouldn't be making a smart speaker, or at least not one that looked like the hit Amazon Echo. Early in the year, it was specifically reported that Apple had ""no apparent interest"" in making an Alexa-like device.It was said that instead Apple wanted to make Siri an ""omnipresent AI assistant across devices,"" instead of having it in a speaker as some kind of central hub. All these years ago, Apple was already talking about AI —  and not only with unnamed executives briefing journalists about smart speakers. ""Look at the core technologies that make up the smartphone today and look at the ones that will be dominant in smartphones of the future —  like AI,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook had said in an interview in August 2016 discussing artificial intelligence company Acquisitions. ""AI will make this product even more essential to you.""And then there was Phil Schiller, who was asked directly in May 2017 what he thought about smart speakers. By then, not only was Amazon topping the sales charts with Alexa devices, but there was also Google Home, so Apple was being beaten to smart speakers twice over.""My mother used to have a saying that if you don't have something nice to say, say nothing at all,"" responded Schiller —  before going on to discuss smart speakers in general. HomePod mini (left) and full-size HomePod""[We] think it's important to —  that there are times when it's convenient to simply use your voice when you are not able to use the screen,"" Schiller said. ""For example, if you're driving [and] you want Siri to work for you without having to look at the screen, that's the best thing.""""Or maybe you're across the room, and you want to ask Siri to change the song you were listening to —  you don't have to walk over and back,"" he continued.That sounded like Apple was surely going to make a Siri speaker, but then Schiller came as close to saying no as any Apple executive ever would.""So there's many moments where a voice assistant is really beneficial, but that doesn't mean you'd never want a screen,"" he said. ""So the idea of not having a screen, I don't think suits many situations.""""And so I think voice assistants are incredibly powerful, their intelligence is going to grow, they're gonna do more for us,"" he continued, ""but the role of the screen is gonna remain very important to all of this.""And that was that. Until a few days later when analyst Ming-Chi Kuo kicked off rumors that Apple would make a Siri speaker with some kind of touch panel. Others said that there was going to be a Siri speaker that resembled the then current Mac Pro.In retrospect, they were all right. The Mac Pro at that time was a small cylinder, and when the HomePod finally shipped, it had a touch panel at the top.And also in early 2017, the rumors were saying that Apple was finalizing its Amazon Echo rival. Ming-Chi Kuo even laid odds, saying there was more than a 50% chance that there would be a Siri Speaker announced at WWDC 2017.Apple announces the HomePod""Now, we've got one last thing to talk to you about,"" said Tim Cook in the WWDC 2017 keynote. ""Let's turn our attention to music.""""Music has always been a part of Apple's DNA,"" he continued. ""We first revolutionized the music industry with iTunes... then we forever changed the way people listen to music on the go with the iPod.""Cook stressed how the iPhone and Apple Music meant you had 40 million songs in your pocket. He stressed how AirPods meant Apple made ""absolutely magical"" wireless audio headphones.""But what about our homes? We think we can do a lot to make this experience much better. Just like we did with portable music, we want to reinvent home music.""Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeAfter really hammering home that Apple was focused on music, Cook then handed over to Phil Schiller who married that to the idea of a smart speaker. Schiller basically dissed all existing portable speakers, saying either they were smart with poor audio, or they had okay audio but weren't smart.""Our team has been hard at work for many years now on a breakthrough home speaker,"" he said.Schiller claimed that HomePod would ""rock the house,"" with music. That it had spatial awareness to adjust its output to suit different environments.Then he said that it would be released later that year. And that was the only thing he was wrong about.We all presumed that by the end of year really meant absolutely late December, and that does seem to have been the plan. During the long months between June's WWDC and that expected release date in time for Christmas, all we had were some aha moments as patent filings revealed details of the HomePod.Delayed HomePod launchesApple does make excellent audio devices, but it also seems to have trouble making them on time. Just as with the AirPods the year before in 2016, Apple aimed for Christmas with the HomePod and didn't make it.AirPods technically did, as small-scale shipping began in late December 2016, but it was into 2017 before those were truly available. With the HomePods, December just came and went.Or at least, December came and went without a HomePod shipping, but there was news. It was in this month that stories began circulating about the HomePod's origins.Reportedly, the HomePod was started as a side project by Apple's Mac audio engineers. And we learned that Schiller hadn't been exaggerating when he said the project had been worked on for many years.It was revealed that HomePod had gone from being this side project to an actual, official endeavour back in 2014. That was before the Amazon Echo was released, but despite feeling ""blindsided"" by that smart speaker, the Apple team didn't think its audio was good enough.And that was always key. Even in 2014, what would become the HomePod was to be about music and high-quality audio. Siri was always going to be part of it, but not an important part.Specifically, Amazon had introduced the idea of ""skills"" —  really just another word for apps —  that could be added to the Echo. HomePod would not do that.What it would do was play music, and we learned that by 2016 it was being tested across Apple. So in 2016, Apple's audio engineers were using it, and apparently retail workers were recruited to test it out.For the rest of us, we didn't hear a word until mid-2017 —  and then we wouldn't hear a word until ""early 2018.""But others, including AppleInsider staff, did get to hear much more than a word. Apple spent the months between announcement and shipping, showing off the HomePod's music quality in private briefings.""I was able to listen to a prototype of Apple's new HomePod audio device, both playing on its own and in concert with a second HomePod unit,"" wrote Daniel Eran Dilger at the time.  ""Rather than sounding like a home speaker, HomePod made me feel like I was sitting in a luxury automobile surrounded by rich, engaging audio reproduction without an obvious source.""Later, on the eve of when Apple was supposed to ship the HomePod, Daniel Eran Dilger summarized the HomePod for AppleInsider. And once more, the point was that HomePod was not about Siri, it  was about ""the future of home audio.""Finally, a HomePodThere were and always will be audiophiles who did not and do not like HomePods. But overall, it's fair to say that the HomePod was very well received for its audio quality.No question, it blew Amazon Echo away. And no question, that was what Apple wanted. High quality audio was indeed always what Apple had aimed at.But then there was something else that Apple always does, and it concerned the price. A HomePod originally cost $349 —  seven times more than an Amazon Echo.We will never know how many HomePods Apple sold, but by 2020 it was looking like the answer was not many. By late 2020 specifically, the rumors were that Apple was not going to make a HomePod 2.But the same rumors were claiming that Apple would make a HomePod mini. For once, a rumor was right factually, and even right about the name.On October 13, 2020, Apple launched the HomePod mini. And on November 6, 2020, it began taking pre-orders for the tiny device. The price was smaller, too. HomePod mini launched at $99 —  and was as well-received as the original HomePod, despite clear differences between the two.Apple does seem to be fundamentally opposed to competing on price, and even at $99, the HomePod mini was twice the price of a base Amazon Echo. But it was a low enough price that if it weren't exactly a casual purchase, it was a lot easier to buy a HomePod mini than the full-size original. HomePod mini was less than half the price of a full-size HomePod, and came in many different colors tooAnd so while again it will never be revealed how many HomePod mini devices Apple has sold, there was a big clue that it was a higher number than for the original HomePod.For in March 2021, Apple called it. The HomePod was dead, long live the HomePod mini.""HomePod mini has been a hit since its debut last fall, offering customers amazing sound, an intelligent assistant, and smart home control all for just $99,"" said Apple in a statement. ""We are focusing our efforts on HomePod mini.""""We are discontinuing the original HomePod, it will continue to be available while supplies last through the Apple Online Store, Apple Retail Stores, and Apple Authorized Resellers,"" it continued. ""Apple will provide HomePod customers with software updates and service and support through Apple Care.""The end of the HomePod was exaggeratedThere was a scramble to buy the remaining HomePods before they went out of stock. But out of stock they went, and while you could still pick some up on eBay, the original HomePod was practically erased from history.Or so it was outside Apple. Inside Apple, something was happening and yet again, we will never know exactly what. It's possible that the success of the HomePod mini was such that Apple began thinking it could do more, that it had begun a market it could now sell more into.Whatever it was, in January 2023 there was that rarest of rare things —  an Apple product announcement that no one saw coming. The full-size HomePod was coming back. The reborn HomePod""Leveraging our audio expertise and innovations, the new HomePod delivers rich, deep bass, natural mid-range, and clear, detailed highs,"" Greg Joswiak, Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, said at the time.  ""With the popularity of HomePod mini, we've seen growing interest in even more powerful acoustics achievable in a larger HomePod.""The new HomePod would look mostly the same —  the top screen is now inset rather than gently rising like a small dome. It would be considerably different on the inside.But the most visible change was the price. The reborn HomePod retailed for $299, a saving of only $50 on the original, but also bringing it below $300.HomePod was back —  but the market was now different and maybe even diffident. In its review of the new model, AppleInsider concluded that it was ""a great speaker"" —  but ""doesn't do much to justify its $300 price tag.""What happens nextOn the seventh anniversary of the original HomePod finally shipping, the home audio market is very different. At the higher music quality end, Sonos has severely stumbled, for instance.Then at the lower smart speaker part of the market, Microsoft's Cortana came and went. Amazon's Alexa seemed to become practically abandoned, although there have been regular rumors of it being revamped with AI.But perhaps the most telling thing for the HomePod is that while we finally, and unexpectedly, got a HomePod 2, there hasn't been a HomePod 3. At least, not yet.It's now just over two years since the full-size HomePod came back, and Apple simply doesn't mention it any more.That said, though, the HomePod mini hasn't exactly changed a lot since its launch in 2021. There have been new colors from time to time, though.And in 2023, we saw an update that brought something surprising to both the HomePod mini and the resurrected full-size HomePod. Both models turned out to have temperature and humidity sensors, built right in.Quite startlingly, what we learned was that the HomePod mini had always had this sensor. It just wasn't used, wasn't mentioned, wasn't enabled for the first two years that the HomePod mini was on sale. It wasn't until January 2023 that a software update turned on these sensors.Apple must have had plans to use these sensors and —  as ever —  we'll doubtlessly never know why it took so long.But the result is that on the anniversary of the original HomePod's launch, there are signs that Apple has long term plans. Yet with the years going by between updates, there are signs that those plans are not working out.Apple is unlikely to cancel the HomePod again, not unless its sales are dramatically poor. And it does appear that the HomePod mini is at least a steady seller, if not an Amazon Echo-level one.So the HomePod range is here to stay, and the HomePod range is very good for listening to music on at home. But maybe Apple has moved on from the HomePod range and what we've got now is all we're going to get.At least until Siri is revamped with Apple Intelligence —  and Apple launches the expected Home Hub.Most recent rumors have painted a picture of the Home Hub as an iPad-like screen. But at various times, it's sounded like it could be more like a regular HomePod with a screen attached.Perhaps that is what Phil Schiller was picturing, way back in 2017 when he chose not say anything unkind about the then-current smart speakers.
There's been a subtle but fundamental change about the HomePod since it was first launched, and especially since it was first rumored. But it isn't a technical change, it's an alteration in how we've come round to thinking of it the way Apple always wanted us to.
Today, the HomePod sits in a range of Apple audio devices that includes the later HomePod mini, but also the whole AirPods range. The HomePod is a speaker, and if Apple doesn't make the absolute finest and greatest audio equipment, it certainly makes the most.
Flash back to the launch in June 2017, though, and a little further to the rumors that began around 2014, and HomePod wasn't a music speaker. It was a smart speaker, it was Apple's answer to Amazon's Alexa.
We expected a Siri Speaker, and Apple was falling behind.
The Amazon Echo, the first Amazon speaker to feature the Alexa voice assistant, had been launched in 2014. Originally released to just Amazon Prime subscribers, by 2015 it seemed to be everywhere, and so Apple seemed to be nowhere.
Apple had acquired Siri and included it in the iPhone 4s back in 2011. Yet despite leading the way with digital assistants, in just those first few years, Siri was already being seen as eclipsed by its rivals.
In 2014, the rumors were starting that something was going to be done about this, and specifically that Apple would enter the smart home space. When WWDC 2014 came in June that year, it was true, Apple launched HomeKit and a push into the smart home —  but not a speaker.
But then just shortly afterwards in August 2014, Apple acquired Beats. At $3 billion, it was and remains Apple's largest ever acquisition of another company, and you don't spend that money on an audio company without a plan.
It just didn't seem as if a Siri Speaker were part of it. In 2015, though, Apple launched its first Bluetooth speaker under the Beats brand. Called the Beats Pill+, this $230 portable speaker introduced charging via Lightning —  and did not introduce Siri.
Instead, while the launch seemed to confirm rumors that there would be a Beats-branded Siri Speaker soon, Apple and Beats concentrated on audio quality.
""When you obsess about sound the way that we do at Beats, portable Bluetooth speakers can be very tricky,"" said Beats President Luke Wood at the time. ""We spent countless days, weeks, months testing for that perfect combination of form and function - small enough to travel but still big enough to feel the emotion of the music. That's what you get with Pill+.""
Then as now, Apple will not budge on its secrecy. But also then as now, Apple does find a way to make its position known —  and it does have to comply with regulatory filings.
So in 2017, Apple was letting the world know that it wouldn't be making a smart speaker, or at least not one that looked like the hit Amazon Echo. Early in the year, it was specifically reported that Apple had ""no apparent interest"" in making an Alexa-like device.
It was said that instead Apple wanted to make Siri an ""omnipresent AI assistant across devices,"" instead of having it in a speaker as some kind of central hub. 
All these years ago, Apple was already talking about AI —  and not only with unnamed executives briefing journalists about smart speakers. 
""Look at the core technologies that make up the smartphone today and look at the ones that will be dominant in smartphones of the future —  like AI,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook had said in an interview in August 2016 discussing artificial intelligence company Acquisitions. ""AI will make this product even more essential to you.""
And then there was Phil Schiller, who was asked directly in May 2017 what he thought about smart speakers. By then, not only was Amazon topping the sales charts with Alexa devices, but there was also Google Home, so Apple was being beaten to smart speakers twice over.
""My mother used to have a saying that if you don't have something nice to say, say nothing at all,"" responded Schiller —  before going on to discuss smart speakers in general.
""[We] think it's important to —  that there are times when it's convenient to simply use your voice when you are not able to use the screen,"" Schiller said. ""For example, if you're driving [and] you want Siri to work for you without having to look at the screen, that's the best thing.""
""Or maybe you're across the room, and you want to ask Siri to change the song you were listening to —  you don't have to walk over and back,"" he continued.
That sounded like Apple was surely going to make a Siri speaker, but then Schiller came as close to saying no as any Apple executive ever would.
""So there's many moments where a voice assistant is really beneficial, but that doesn't mean you'd never want a screen,"" he said. ""So the idea of not having a screen, I don't think suits many situations.""
""And so I think voice assistants are incredibly powerful, their intelligence is going to grow, they're gonna do more for us,"" he continued, ""but the role of the screen is gonna remain very important to all of this.""
And that was that. Until a few days later when analyst Ming-Chi Kuo kicked off rumors that Apple would make a Siri speaker with some kind of touch panel. Others said that there was going to be a Siri speaker that resembled the then current Mac Pro.
In retrospect, they were all right. The Mac Pro at that time was a small cylinder, and when the HomePod finally shipped, it had a touch panel at the top.
And also in early 2017, the rumors were saying that Apple was finalizing its Amazon Echo rival. Ming-Chi Kuo even laid odds, saying there was more than a 50% chance that there would be a Siri Speaker announced at WWDC 2017.
""Now, we've got one last thing to talk to you about,"" said Tim Cook in the WWDC 2017 keynote. ""Let's turn our attention to music.""
""Music has always been a part of Apple's DNA,"" he continued. ""We first revolutionized the music industry with iTunes... then we forever changed the way people listen to music on the go with the iPod.""
Cook stressed how the iPhone and Apple Music meant you had 40 million songs in your pocket. He stressed how AirPods meant Apple made ""absolutely magical"" wireless audio headphones.
""But what about our homes? We think we can do a lot to make this experience much better. Just like we did with portable music, we want to reinvent home music.""
After really hammering home that Apple was focused on music, Cook then handed over to Phil Schiller who married that to the idea of a smart speaker. Schiller basically dissed all existing portable speakers, saying either they were smart with poor audio, or they had okay audio but weren't smart.
""Our team has been hard at work for many years now on a breakthrough home speaker,"" he said.
Schiller claimed that HomePod would ""rock the house,"" with music. That it had spatial awareness to adjust its output to suit different environments.
Then he said that it would be released later that year. And that was the only thing he was wrong about.
We all presumed that by the end of year really meant absolutely late December, and that does seem to have been the plan. During the long months between June's WWDC and that expected release date in time for Christmas, all we had were some aha moments as patent filings revealed details of the HomePod.
Apple does make excellent audio devices, but it also seems to have trouble making them on time. Just as with the AirPods the year before in 2016, Apple aimed for Christmas with the HomePod and didn't make it.
AirPods technically did, as small-scale shipping began in late December 2016, but it was into 2017 before those were truly available. With the HomePods, December just came and went.
Or at least, December came and went without a HomePod shipping, but there was news. It was in this month that stories began circulating about the HomePod's origins.
Reportedly, the HomePod was started as a side project by Apple's Mac audio engineers. And we learned that Schiller hadn't been exaggerating when he said the project had been worked on for many years.
It was revealed that HomePod had gone from being this side project to an actual, official endeavour back in 2014. That was before the Amazon Echo was released, but despite feeling ""blindsided"" by that smart speaker, the Apple team didn't think its audio was good enough.
And that was always key. Even in 2014, what would become the HomePod was to be about music and high-quality audio. Siri was always going to be part of it, but not an important part.
Specifically, Amazon had introduced the idea of ""skills"" —  really just another word for apps —  that could be added to the Echo. HomePod would not do that.
What it would do was play music, and we learned that by 2016 it was being tested across Apple. So in 2016, Apple's audio engineers were using it, and apparently retail workers were recruited to test it out.
For the rest of us, we didn't hear a word until mid-2017 —  and then we wouldn't hear a word until ""early 2018.""
But others, including AppleInsider staff, did get to hear much more than a word. Apple spent the months between announcement and shipping, showing off the HomePod's music quality in private briefings.
""I was able to listen to a prototype of Apple's new HomePod audio device, both playing on its own and in concert with a second HomePod unit,"" wrote Daniel Eran Dilger at the time.  ""Rather than sounding like a home speaker, HomePod made me feel like I was sitting in a luxury automobile surrounded by rich, engaging audio reproduction without an obvious source.""
Later, on the eve of when Apple was supposed to ship the HomePod, Daniel Eran Dilger summarized the HomePod for AppleInsider. And once more, the point was that HomePod was not about Siri, it  was about ""the future of home audio.""
There were and always will be audiophiles who did not and do not like HomePods. But overall, it's fair to say that the HomePod was very well received for its audio quality.
No question, it blew Amazon Echo away. And no question, that was what Apple wanted. High quality audio was indeed always what Apple had aimed at.
But then there was something else that Apple always does, and it concerned the price. A HomePod originally cost $349 —  seven times more than an Amazon Echo.
We will never know how many HomePods Apple sold, but by 2020 it was looking like the answer was not many. By late 2020 specifically, the rumors were that Apple was not going to make a HomePod 2.
But the same rumors were claiming that Apple would make a HomePod mini. For once, a rumor was right factually, and even right about the name.
On October 13, 2020, Apple launched the HomePod mini. And on November 6, 2020, it began taking pre-orders for the tiny device. 
The price was smaller, too. HomePod mini launched at $99 —  and was as well-received as the original HomePod, despite clear differences between the two.
Apple does seem to be fundamentally opposed to competing on price, and even at $99, the HomePod mini was twice the price of a base Amazon Echo. But it was a low enough price that if it weren't exactly a casual purchase, it was a lot easier to buy a HomePod mini than the full-size original.
And so while again it will never be revealed how many HomePod mini devices Apple has sold, there was a big clue that it was a higher number than for the original HomePod.
For in March 2021, Apple called it. The HomePod was dead, long live the HomePod mini.
""HomePod mini has been a hit since its debut last fall, offering customers amazing sound, an intelligent assistant, and smart home control all for just $99,"" said Apple in a statement. ""We are focusing our efforts on HomePod mini.""
""We are discontinuing the original HomePod, it will continue to be available while supplies last through the Apple Online Store, Apple Retail Stores, and Apple Authorized Resellers,"" it continued. ""Apple will provide HomePod customers with software updates and service and support through Apple Care.""
There was a scramble to buy the remaining HomePods before they went out of stock. But out of stock they went, and while you could still pick some up on eBay, the original HomePod was practically erased from history.
Or so it was outside Apple. 
Inside Apple, something was happening and yet again, we will never know exactly what. It's possible that the success of the HomePod mini was such that Apple began thinking it could do more, that it had begun a market it could now sell more into.
Whatever it was, in January 2023 there was that rarest of rare things —  an Apple product announcement that no one saw coming. The full-size HomePod was coming back.
""Leveraging our audio expertise and innovations, the new HomePod delivers rich, deep bass, natural mid-range, and clear, detailed highs,"" Greg Joswiak, Apple's senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, said at the time.  ""With the popularity of HomePod mini, we've seen growing interest in even more powerful acoustics achievable in a larger HomePod.""

I still have my first-gen, full-size HomePods -- two of them, used via my Apple TV box and television to play music and TV sound. They still work flawlessly and deliver great room-filling sound, but if a more sophisticated third-gen model is produced alongside Apple's plans for a smarter Siri, I'll finally have an excuse to replace them.

I still have my first-gen, full-size HomePods -- two of them, used via my Apple TV box and television to play music and TV sound. They still work flawlessly and deliver great room-filling sound, but if a more sophisticated third-gen model is produced alongside Apple's plans for a smarter Siri, I'll finally have an excuse to replace them.
I had the original full-size HomePod and I thought the sound it produced was wonderful. My original one had an audio anomaly during the warranty period and Apple replaced the whole unit after I turned in the broken one at the Apple Store and Apple shipped me the replacement. The replacement unit lasted a couple of years and it also died completely. Prior to the death of my second HomePod I received an Amazon Echo Studio as a gift so I switched over to that. In terms of my own listening experience the Echo Studio is not even close to the same sound quality as my first edition HomePod. The Echo Studio has more features, plenty of volume and bass, and a smarter voice control, but it has never matched up to what I learned to love about the HomePod. If the original HomePod sound quality was a 10 the Echo Studio is more like a 7-7.5. After I reluctantly switched over to the Echo Studio is when Apple went quiet with the full-size HomePod so I've put up with the Echo Studio ever since. I've known for a while that there is a second gen full-size HomePod available, but I held off a bit because my previous HomePod and now the Echo Studio live in my kitchen and I don't spend a lot of time in there. In the meantime got a HomePod mini for a different location. It sounded pretty good for its size, but no match for its older brother. To give the HomePod mini a better chance to redeem itself I got a second one and set up a stereo pair. The stereo pair significantly improved my satisfaction with the HomePod mini. I can see where the stereo pair of minis would be a great desktop setup with a Mac, but not in my kitchen. I encountered some initial growing pains with the minis but I believe they were mostly attributed to Apple's Home app which at the time was not so great to say then least. After a series of firmware and software updates to hardware and software the HomePod mini pair has been rock solid. The HomePod mini pair still impresses me with the quality and undistorted sound, even at higher volume level. I use them as an audio output from my Apple TV, music, and integral parts of Apple Home. Those little orange buggers can really push out some great sound. I can only imagine how well a stereo pair of the big boys would sound.Now I'm at the point where I've decided to re-home the Echo Studio. It was free, it works okay, but it just doesn't live up to the sound quality of my deceased HomePod. I'm missing my HomePod more than ever. Now with rumors swirling about a next gen HomePod being on the horizon I'm waiting until I see what card Apple decides to play in the next round of upgrades to this product line. For my particular use case, which is room filling background music at moderate volume when I'm cooking and eating, I do not need or want a hybrid audio-visual HomePod. I need to keep my eyes focused on what I'm doing. If Apple gives the full-size HomePad a pass on the next upgrade cycle I'll gladly settle on the current version, but I'm holding out for something that is surprisingly better even if it's only a smarter Siri with a little Apple Intelligence infusion. Please Apple, just don't mess with the sound quality.[Edit] Kudos to the Apple Insider team for the recent updates to your desktop and mobile web pages. I'm really enjoying the additional controls and I like seeing the comment number badges on the top level article listings. Thank you.

I have a pair of the original HomePods in my office room and listen to music during my work hours. I love them and was very upset when both of them stopped working a couple of years back.After months of searching for someone to service them (Apple India does not service HomePods. They will replace them if they are under warranty, but will not look into them if they are out of warranty - not even for a fee), I finally found someone who repaired both of them.Now I've taken the precaution of having them connected to a surge suppressor and they are working as good as new.

HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) — At dawn, 65-year-old Nelly Mutandwa swapped her pajamas for leggings, a T-shirt and sneakers. She grabbed a bottle of water before heading to an unconventional workout spot: a cemetery in Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare.
Surrounded by rows of graves, she joined other members of the Commandos Fitness Club in an hour-long session of squats, lunges and stretches as upbeat music blared. For Mutandwa, the daily routine is more than exercise. It’s her lifeline in managing diabetes.
“They are resting,” she said, pointing to the graves. “I just don’t want to join them yet. That means I have to do the hard work here.”
With limited fitness facilities such as gyms in their neighborhoods, older Zimbabweans are exercising wherever they can to combat Africa’s growing problem of non-communicable diseases like heart problems, high blood pressure and diabetes. Other groups exercise along highways or disused railway lines.
Globally, non-communicable diseases, which are conditions that cannot be directly passed from person to person, are the leading cause of death, responsible for 41 million, or 74%, of annual fatalities, according to the World Health Organization.
Non-communicable diseases currently account for about 40% of deaths annually in Zimbabwe, according to its ministry of health and child care.
In Zimbabwe and the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, non-communicable diseases are set to overtake communicable diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and cholera as the leading cause of death or illness by 2030, according to WHO.
Previously associated with older people, non-communicable diseases are increasingly spreading to children and young adults due to smoking, frequent alcohol use, unhealthy diets and lack of physical activity.
This has sparked huge concern among experts and governments on a continent that is experiencing the world’s fastest population growth and is home to its youngest population.
Dr. Johannes Marisa, a public health specialist in Harare and president of the Medical and Dental Private Practitioners of Zimbabwe Association, said doctors are witnessing “a rapid change” as more children and young people are diagnosed with NCDs.
He attributed it partly to sedentary lifestyles as many people spend much of their time glued to their smartphone screens at the expense of physical movement, as well as growing substance abuse and unhealthy diets.
While climate change-induced droughts have left many rural people in Zimbabwe scrounging for food, traders in urban areas are racing to get a piece of the fast food market that’s widely blamed for obesity.
In Harare and other urban areas, franchises such as KFC compete with a mushrooming number of cheaper local restaurants and informal roadside stalls, public markets and even homes where one can grab a fried piece of chicken, a burger or a fries-and-sausage combo for a dollar.
In response, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube in the 2025 national budget imposed a “modest” 0.5% tax on sales of doughnuts and other foods including tacos, pizza, hot dogs, shawarma, fries, chicken and burgers by retailers to encourage “healthier dietary choices” and mitigate the prevalence of non-communicable diseases.
Meanwhile, some older Zimbabweans are taking up physical exercise.
For Mutandwa and her Commandos Fitness Club crew, the surroundings of the cemetery suffice. Coached by Joseph Nekati, whose mother’s stroke in 2023 inspired him to help others, the free club has become a sanctuary for older fitness buffs. Eight of the club’s roughly 20 members are older people, Nekati said.
“I weighed 86 kilograms (189 pounds) and struggled to stand up. I would struggle to breathe just walking in my house. Now, I’m down to 76 kilograms (167 pounds) and I can walk long distances,” said Susan Gomo, a 64-year-old grandmother managing high blood pressure and arthritis.
The group exercise is also meant to encourage other older people to work out. “Some of my age mates are reluctant,” Gomo said. “They end up just eating and sitting at home. They might change their minds when they see me in great shape.”
Mutandwa said she picked up the habit of power walks when she visited her daughter in the United Kingdom in 2022. She decided to try it back home in Zimbabwe, but the roads in her township were potholed and crowded. She went for solo walks on a nearby hill, but she felt unsafe.
Last year, she noticed the fitness club in the cemetery, where a wide and well-maintained path provides a convenient workout spot. With three of her neighbors, she approached the coach, who happily took them in.
Now the cemetery has come to symbolize Mutandwa and others’ quest to live healthier and outpace death — one step at a time.
“It’s serene, it’s safe and we have a lot of space with minimal disturbances. Hopefully the (local) council can build proper facilities for us,” she said, preparing to stroll back home.

29,2025-02-09,"Cavalry FC forward Myer Bevan, right, celebrates a goal with teammate Daan Klomp during their 2024 ... [+] Concacaf Champions Cup match against MLS side Orlando City. Cavalry defeated Liga MX club Pumas UNAM 2-1 during the first leg of their 2025 CCC first round series on Wednesday.
Since Major League Soccer’s Canadian contingent expanded to three clubs in 2012, it’s tough to remember a time when preseason hopes for CF Montreal, Toronto FC and the Vancouver Whitecaps were so timid.
The Whitecaps parted with popular coach Vanni Sartini after last season and transferred midfielder Stuart Armstrong to the English second tier just months after his much-ballyhooed arrival, amid the backdrop of ownership putting the club up for sale.
Lorenzo Insigne and Federico Bernardeschi era are a year older at Toronto FC and going through preseason under a third manager after the previous two failed to succeed amid injuries and dysfunction.
And although CF Montreal exceeded expectations in Year 1 under Laurent Courtois, a May shakeup in the front office followed by a winter without any inspiring signings suggests the fringe of the playoff picture is still the club’s ceiling.
Enter Calgary-based Cavalry FC of the second-tier Canadian Premier League, which pulled off one of the most famous wins in eight-year-old league’s history on Wednesday night with it’s 2-1 triumph over Pumas UNAM of Liga MX.
Cavalry’s victory in Leg 1 of the teams’ first-round series in the Concacaf Champions Cup was remarkable for a few reasons. The Canadians came from a goal down against the Mexico City outfit. They hadn’t played a competitive match since Nov. 9 and won’t play another league fixture until the new season opens in early April.
If they could grind out a result in the return leg in Mexico City, it would complete one of the biggest upsets in competition history. And regardless of the Leg 2 outcome, hopefully their moment on the big stage will remind Canada’s MLS clubs they longer have the pro soccer market completely cornered.
Whatever you think of the closed system that guarantees MLS clubs permanent status in the North American top flight (compared with promotion and relegation elsewhere), it’s clear that Canadian clubs hold an even greater advantage over their lower-division counterparts than the now-27 American MLS clubs in terms of gaining exposure in their local markets and across the nation.
While Apple TV has worldwide streaming rights of all MLS matches, Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal get considerably more linear TV time than their American colleagues, with 41 combined regular season games broadcast by TSN and RDS.
The more diverse geography of MLS also allows those Canadian teams a considerably longer season than CPL sides, who complete their entire calendar between April and November because of harsh Canadian winters.
And there is also less competition with other major professional sports in local markets. Only Toronto – a city of roughly 3 million – has three teams in the North American Big Four leagues of the MLB, NBA, NFL and NHL. Vancouver and Montreal only have NHL franchises. (All three cities also host CFL teams.)
Those advantages should position the trio of clubs to be perennial MLS contenders. And yet only Toronto has competed at a consistently elite level in the trio’s combined MLS history.
Perhaps they’ve punched below their weight in part because of the larger picture in Canadian soccer, which has often felt like less than the sum of its parts. Despite a reasonable collection of talent, Canada failed to even come close to qualifying for the FIFA World Cup between its 1986 and 2022 appearances. The nation boasts one major continental honor in their history – the 2001 Concacaf Gold Cup title – and went 22 years without a true first division club until Toronto FC joined MLS at the start of the 2007 season.
Even now, as arguably the best generation of Canada national team talent in history prepares to play 2026 FIFA World Cup games on its own soil, Canada Soccer finds itself burdened by financial problems.
To be fair, MLS academies have played an enormous role in raising the level of play in the national team. And they have also provided rationale for the founding of the CPL in 2017, by proving that maybe the problem wasn’t lack of talent, but rather lack of a robust pro pipeline.
But as a pro league, the CPL hasn’t really waged war for local fans in the way the USL has done battle with American MLS clubs. Part of that is probably a lack of maturity of the league, and part of it an appreciation for how much the launch of Canadian MLS clubs helped change the soccer outlook north of the border.
But Cavalry’s performance may be proof of concept to some fans that, while the CPL is not on the same level as MLS or Liga MX, the product is strong enough to be worth supporting. Vancouver FC and York United provide fans in Vancouver and Toronto, respectively, local alternatives to their MLS sides. Montreal is not reported to be on the list of potential expansion sites for 2026, but perhaps it should be.
Cavalry can’t play their way into MLS to become direct competitors of the Whitecaps, TFC and CF Montreal. But hopefully they’ve played their way into fans’ consciousness and standards for what should be possible for Canadian club soccer, and will light a fire under those MLS organizations to more urgently try to realize that potential.

Apple looks set to launch the iPhone SE earlier than many expected, with a reveal of the mid-range handset expected within the next week. With the community coming to an agreement over the specifications of the fourth iteration of the iPhone SE, Apple's design decisions are clear. So are the consequences of those decisions.
One of the issues Tim Cook and his team are facing is the iPhone 16. Apple needs to balance out offering enough capability in the iPhone SE to make it attractive to the mid-range market while keeping enough technological distance from the iPhone 16 to allow for a meaningful upsell to the more expensive smartphone.
Update, Sunday Feb 9, 2025: The latest edition of Power On has Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman picking out the hardware changes in the iPhone SE, including some of the more minor yet still consequential upgrades that will impact how the iPhone SE fits in with the current style of smartphones.
One of the changes that impacts the display is removing the home key. Once a staple on every smartphone, it was slowly replaced by an on-screen software-based button and then with a simple swipe gesture. All these helped maximise the available space, eventually leading to our full frontal displays. For the first time, the iPhone SE will sport this expansive look.
The other change is to the connector. Every previous iPhone has sported a lightning connector at the base of the smartphone. Following the introduction of the Common Charger legislation in the European Union—where all small- and medium-sized portable devices must charge over USB-C—Apple withdrew 2022’s lightning port-equipped iPhone SE from sale. When the iPhone SE returns, it will return with a USB-C port, not just in the EU, but worldwide.
The competing manufacturers in this space do not need to hold themselves back from offering more features, more performance, and more potential in the way Apple has to. This has led to the proposed iPhone SE specifications falling behind the competition and with Apple's price premium potentially more expensive as well.
The iPhone SE has always been seen as a smaller handset than the main line. That's apparently not the case with the fourth generation of the SE. The reported 6.1-inch screen matches that of the iPhone 16, as does the slow refresh rate of 60Hz. While that might feel sufficient for a low-spec smartphone, the mid-range is not the place for low-spec smartphones.
Fast refreshing screens are commonplace at this price point. The smooth animations and the increased comfort are considered minimum stakes in the Android world. The option to have a variable rate, potentially all the way down to a battery saving 1Hz, can be seen on a small number of handsets, but the option is there.
The screen is the first point of contact for any smartphone. The first impression of the iPhone SE is weaker than the competition.
Flipping over the iPhone SE will reveal a single camera lens. Again this is in keeping with previous iPhone SE models. The dual lens on the iPhone 16 means a clear differentiation between SE and 16 is visible to Apple customers.
It's also a clear difference between the iPhone SE and almost every competitor's mid-range smartphone. Apple may talk about the advantages of the Neural Engine in capturing and editing the best shot possible, but there's only one lens. Other phones on the same shelf offer a telephoto, panoramic, ultrawide or even a macro lens.
The iPhone SE loses this most straightforward of comparisons.
While it is not visible on the phone, a glance at the main specs will show the iPhone SE's battery comes in at a reported 3,279 mAh. That's significantly lower than some of the key competing smartphones; the Google Pixel 8a sports 4,492 mAh, and both the Oppo Reno12 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy A55 have specs-busting 5,000 mAh.
No doubt Apple will follow many in the industry and go with how many hours of ""average daily use"" and ""streaming video"" hours its phone can achieve, but again, the raw numbers of the iPhone SE fall short of the competition.
It's worth circling back on the price of the iPhone SE. The current iPhone SE (launched in 2022) is priced at $429 for the entry-level 64 GB model. Given the move up to the latest A18 processor, the extra memory required for Apple Intelligence (and possibly additional storage as well to future-proof Apple Intelligence on the iPhone SE), a retail price of $479 is expected. It would not be a surprise to see Apple leverage the premium brand values of Apple and take the SE right up to $499, especially if the entry-level model sports 128 GB of storage.
That will match the price of the 128 GB Pixel 8a in the US, at which point the lower battery, weaker screen, and smaller camera will all play into a consumer’s purchasing decision.

The iPhone SE is a gateway into Apple's world. It needs to attract consumers to join Cupertino's world, yet the iPhone SE's first impressions are not attractive.
For Apple's dedicated community, these concerns will be easily put aside, partly due to the soft lock-in the Apple ecosystem offers and the knowledge of the benefits that the tight integration between hardware and software can make up for some of these shortfalls.
Can the iPhone SE deliver for both audiences?

31,2025-02-09,"Update, Sunday Feb 9, 2025: This article has been updated with details on Apple’s new 5G modem and potential pricing.

Apple’s eagerly awaited return to the ultra-competitive mid-range smartphone market with a new iPhone SE could happen in the next week.
Writing for Bloomberg, noted Apple reporter Mark Gurman offering a schedule for the release of the iPhone SE; and it’s faster than many anticipated: ""The company expects to announce the device as early as next week, ahead of it going on sale later in the month, according to people with knowledge of the matter.""
The launch of the fourth iPhone SE has been pencilled in for Q1 2025 by the community for nearly a year, although recent reporting has pointed to a late March release, possibly slipping into early April. This would happen close to the release of iOS 18.4 and the final steps in the first generation suite of AI tools awkwardly backronymed to Apple Intelligence.
Those plans look set to change, at least in part. Although Gurman reports a launch in the coming days, the actual release of the iPhone SE is a more nebulous “later in the month,” pushing deeper into Q1.
Update, Sunday Feb 9, 2025: Writing for Bloomberg’s Power On newsletter, noted Apple reporter Mark Gurman doubts-own on his prediction of an iPhone SE launch “this week.” With Apple planning to launch the new smartphone by press release, there’s nothing to stop that being delayed if circumstances warrant it.
Gurman also picks out features that Apple’s community will regard as new—removing a physical home button, adding facial recognition through Face ID, and replacing the Lightning port with a USB-C connector.
Perhaps the most surprising prediction, and one that will mark out the iPhone SE as an expensive handset in the mid-range, is the suggested price. Gurman indicates a cost of around $500. That suggests a move to 128 GB of storage for the entry-level model. Even then, it will be $20 more expensive than the previous 128 GB version.

Update, Saturday Feb 8, 2025: One interesting quirk of launching earlier is the feedback Apple will get from the iPhone SE’s 5G modem. 9to5Mac reports that the SE will debut Apple’s in-house modem rather than the Qualcomm chipset that has served countless iPhone models over the last decade. This will be Apple’s first modem following the purchase of Intel’s smartphone modem division for $1 billion in July 2019.
Apple will be keen to bring the modem stack under its complete control rather than following Qualcomm’s roadmap and timescales. The iPhone SE will be the first public step in this process. No doubt, a further step will be taken in Sept 2025, with at least one of the new iPhone 17 models coming with an Apple modem.
The early launch of the iPhone SE in late February, compared to potentially mid-April, which was previously discussed, will give Apple user data from the modem some six weeks earlier, which will give more than enough time to contribute to the final design of the iPhone 17 family.
There are some advantages for Tim Cook and his team if the decision is made to reveal the iPhone SE at this point in time.
First, launching a new iPhone will boost overall sales. While the iPhone 15 was the top-selling smartphone in global sales for 2024, Apple’s global share of the smartphone market fell in the last quarter of 2024, according to data from Counterpoint Research. This quarter includes the vast majority of sales of the current iPhone 16 family.
Then, there is the competitive nature of the mid-range market. Before Apple can sell the iPhone SE it has to stop consumers from buying a smartphone from another manufacturer. This year’s Mobile World Congress will take place on Monday, March 3, and a raft of new smartphones will be announced, many of which will directly compete with the iPhone SE.
While the die-hards in the Apple community will wait for the SE, the average consumer may not be as connected to the release dates. Launching and releasing before MWC will give the iPhone SE a clearer run to the market.
Finally, Apple can take better control of the story by launching early. In the MWC run-up, many smartphones set to launch in Barcelona will have their specs, details and unique features leaked. Manufacturers will hope this ties in with their marketing decisions, but that may not be the case. The same is true—perhaps more so— for any new iPhone release.
It has been three years since Apple launched a mid-range smartphone, and the market has changed. Cameras have multiple lenses and improved optics, chipsets are faster with more performance, storage and memory have grown closer to flagship levels, and generative AI has become a huge selling point in the last year.
Apple’s AI efforts are competent at best, the main camera is expected to offer just a single lens and the “iPhone price premium” could work against the hardware in such a competitive space. Apple's decision to get ahead of the story and set its own terms may be the most significant benefit of an early announcement.
With all that said, the iPhone SE could become one of the pivotal iPhones to come out of Cupertino in years.
Now read more about the potential specifications of the iPhone SE...

Once you completed your studies and got hired, your employer provided a clear pathway for advancement, sent you invites to training programs, offered opportunities for new roles, and provided long-term stability as long as you performed and stayed loyal.
But long-term job stability is disappearing. AI and automation are reshaping industries at an unprecedented pace, making skills obsolete faster than ever. As companies race to reskill their workforce, they will prioritize business needs—not your long-term career. Your real job security no longer comes from your employer; it depends on your ability to stay relevant in the job market. The responsibility for career development has decisively shifted from the company to the individual.
David Fano, CEO of Teal, argues that professionals need to take control of their careers and develop a sense of agency, even if they are salaried employees. In a podcast conversation, he explained: “It’s not waiting for the company to train you; you’ve got to train yourself. It’s not waiting for the company to say, ‘Hey, we're doing a comp review,’ and then hoping for a raise. You need to know your worth and go get paid more.”
This means thinking strategically about your skills, market value, and future opportunities—even if you have no intention of leaving your job. Because even if you’re happy with your job, your employer, and your career, change will come. Not a question of “if,” only of “when.” With career life cycles shortening due to the faster aging of knowledge and rapid redesign of work by technology, you’re unlikely to retire from the same job, employer, or perhaps even profession. That means you must take control of your professional development, continuously update your skills, stay aware of industry changes, and ensure your professional identity and capabilities remain relevant and valuable.
Many companies offer professional development content, platforms, and budgets. Yet many managers focus on daily work and fail to ensure their teams take advantage of these opportunities. As Fano observes: “People don’t even use the budgets. They're not willing to make the time.”
The first step? Make time for training—not for today’s job, but for tomorrow’s opportunities. And budget for it. If the skills that interest you aren’t aligned with your current role, or if your employer won’t fund a course, conference, or professional network membership, don’t forgo your own development. Standing still is the same as moving backward. Investing in courses, certifications, and learning—whether or not your company reimburses you—is the price of career longevity. The best professionals understand that upskilling isn’t a corporate perk; it’s a survival strategy.
Think of it this way—if the skills stay with you when you leave your employer, they define your professional identity. And that means you need to invest in them, even if your employer doesn’t.
The tools shaping the future of work aren’t just for tech professionals. AI-powered platforms, automation software, and data analytics tools are becoming essential across all industries. Waiting for your employer to mandate learning these tools is a surefire way to become obsolete.
Fano emphasizes that you’re not learning for your boss—you’re learning for yourself: “Every experience you get, those are your skills. Those belong with you. Those experiences, those belong to you. Those relationships, those belong to you.” Even if your day job doesn’t require these skills yet, you should proactively explore new technologies and trends so that you’re prepared for when they do become essential.
And beyond preparation, there’s opportunity. If you’re consistently updating your professional profile and showcasing your learning, others will recognize that you’re staying ahead of the curve. Soon enough, cutting-edge opportunities will start coming your way.
The biggest mindset shift for salaried employees is moving from “looking for a job” to being “always on”—constantly aware of how the job market is evolving and where your interests and capabilities align with emerging opportunities.
That’s why networking isn’t just for job seekers. The best time to build relationships is when you don’t need them. Whether it’s attending industry events, engaging in online communities, or connecting with peers on LinkedIn, the goal is to ensure that you understand what is changing and can adjust your career accordingly. This way, when you do need a new opportunity, your network is already in place.
Networking isn’t about actively searching for a new job—it’s about staying informed. And meeting people to discuss opportunities shouldn’t be seen as disloyal or awkward. Even full-time, highly successful employees should be thinking about ways to diversify their skills, projects, and professional circles. This could mean working on side projects, joining advisory boards, or simply staying informed about changes in your industry and adjacent career paths.
The corporate ladder is gone. The safety net of long-term employment has vanished. The only security left is the one you build for yourself. The real question isn’t whether you should take control of your career—it’s how much longer you can afford to wait.
This article includes insights from a conversation with David Fano, recorded as part of “The Future Of Less Work” podcast.

Apple CEO Tim Cook visits the Fifth Avenue Apple Store on September 16, 2022 in New York City. ... [+] (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images)
Apple looks set to launch the iPhone SE earlier than many expected, with a reveal of the mid-range handset expected within the next week. With the community coming to an agreement over the specifications of the fourth iteration of the iPhone SE, Apple's design decisions are clear. So are the consequences of those decisions.
One of the issues Tim Cook and his team are facing is the iPhone 16. Apple needs to balance out offering enough capability in the iPhone SE to make it attractive to the mid-range market while keeping enough technological distance from the iPhone 16 to allow for a meaningful upsell to the more expensive smartphone.
Update, Sunday Feb 9, 2025: The latest edition of Power On has Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman picking out the hardware changes in the iPhone SE, including some of the more minor yet still consequential upgrades that will impact how the iPhone SE fits in with the current style of smartphones.
One of the changes that impacts the display is removing the home key. Once a staple on every smartphone, it was slowly replaced by an on-screen software-based button and then with a simple swipe gesture. All these helped maximise the available space, eventually leading to our full frontal displays. For the first time, the iPhone SE will sport this expansive look.
The other change is to the connector. Every previous iPhone has sported a lightning connector at the base of the smartphone. Following the introduction of the Common Charger legislation in the European Union—where all small- and medium-sized portable devices must charge over USB-C—Apple withdrew 2022’s lightning port-equipped iPhone SE from sale. When the iPhone SE returns, it will return with a USB-C port, not just in the EU, but worldwide.
The competing manufacturers in this space do not need to hold themselves back from offering more features, more performance, and more potential in the way Apple has to. This has led to the proposed iPhone SE specifications falling behind the competition and with Apple's price premium potentially more expensive as well.
The iPhone SE has always been seen as a smaller handset than the main line. That's apparently not the case with the fourth generation of the SE. The reported 6.1-inch screen matches that of the iPhone 16, as does the slow refresh rate of 60Hz. While that might feel sufficient for a low-spec smartphone, the mid-range is not the place for low-spec smartphones.
Fast refreshing screens are commonplace at this price point. The smooth animations and the increased comfort are considered minimum stakes in the Android world. The option to have a variable rate, potentially all the way down to a battery saving 1Hz, can be seen on a small number of handsets, but the option is there.
The screen is the first point of contact for any smartphone. The first impression of the iPhone SE is weaker than the competition.
Flipping over the iPhone SE will reveal a single camera lens. Again this is in keeping with previous iPhone SE models. The dual lens on the iPhone 16 means a clear differentiation between SE and 16 is visible to Apple customers.
It's also a clear difference between the iPhone SE and almost every competitor's mid-range smartphone. Apple may talk about the advantages of the Neural Engine in capturing and editing the best shot possible, but there's only one lens. Other phones on the same shelf offer a telephoto, panoramic, ultrawide or even a macro lens.
The iPhone SE loses this most straightforward of comparisons.
While it is not visible on the phone, a glance at the main specs will show the iPhone SE's battery comes in at a reported 3,279 mAh. That's significantly lower than some of the key competing smartphones; the Google Pixel 8a sports 4,492 mAh, and both the Oppo Reno12 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy A55 have specs-busting 5,000 mAh.
No doubt Apple will follow many in the industry and go with how many hours of ""average daily use"" and ""streaming video"" hours its phone can achieve, but again, the raw numbers of the iPhone SE fall short of the competition.
It's worth circling back on the price of the iPhone SE. The current iPhone SE (launched in 2022) is priced at $429 for the entry-level 64 GB model. Given the move up to the latest A18 processor, the extra memory required for Apple Intelligence (and possibly additional storage as well to future-proof Apple Intelligence on the iPhone SE), a retail price of $479 is expected. It would not be a surprise to see Apple leverage the premium brand values of Apple and take the SE right up to $499, especially if the entry-level model sports 128 GB of storage.
That will match the price of the 128 GB Pixel 8a in the US, at which point the lower battery, weaker screen, and smaller camera will all play into a consumer’s purchasing decision.

The iPhone SE is a gateway into Apple's world. It needs to attract consumers to join Cupertino's world, yet the iPhone SE's first impressions are not attractive.
For Apple's dedicated community, these concerns will be easily put aside, partly due to the soft lock-in the Apple ecosystem offers and the knowledge of the benefits that the tight integration between hardware and software can make up for some of these shortfalls.
Can the iPhone SE deliver for both audiences?

We recently compiled a list of the 13 Best Dividend Growth Stocks With 10%+ Yearly Increases. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) stands against the other dividend growth stocks.
Dividend stocks faced a tough year in 2024 as investor focus largely moved toward technology stocks. The Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks companies with a minimum of 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, gained just over 6% in 2024, falling well behind the broader market’s nearly 25% return. This lagging performance isn’t uncommon for dividend stocks, which often struggle to attract interest when more high-growth opportunities dominate the market. However, experienced investors may see the long-term value and stability that dividend stocks continue to offer.
Dividends have historically been a key component of total returns for US stocks, contributing nearly one-third of overall equity gains since 1926. Between 1980 and 2019, a period characterized by declining interest rates, dividends accounted for 75% of the broader market’s returns. In a low-rate environment, dividends become even more valuable by ensuring a steady income stream when fixed-income investments provide lower yields. Companies that introduce dividends rarely discontinue them and often increase payouts over time. In addition, offering a dividend can make a stock more attractive to investors, potentially driving up its market value.

A report by Franklin Templeton highlighted that over the past decade, dividends for the broader market index have consistently grown at an average annual rate of just over 7%. In strong market conditions, dividends have helped enhance total returns, while in difficult years—such as 2020 and 2022, when market returns were weak or negative—they played a crucial role in stabilizing returns and strengthening portfolio resilience.
Dividend-paying stocks offer more than just regular payouts—they often provide a defensive edge, making them valuable during periods when preserving wealth and maintaining steady income are priorities. A report by Eagle Asset Management examined instances where the broader market declined by at least 15% before recovering to its previous high. The study used three dividend-focused benchmarks to emphasize the importance of not only investing in dividend-yielding companies but also prioritizing those with a track record of consistently increasing payouts. The findings revealed that indexes composed of dividend-paying companies tend to outperform the broader market, particularly during prolonged downturns. This highlights the resilience and potential outperformance of dividend-focused investments during turbulent market conditions.
Dividends play a significant role in global equity markets, contributing approximately 34% of the MSCI World Index’s annual returns since February 1, 1970. Historically, holding shares in companies committed to dividend growth has provided several advantages, including strong absolute returns and superior risk-adjusted performance across full market cycles. These investments have also demonstrated lower volatility compared to the broader MSCI World Index, offering a level of capital preservation even in challenging market environments. In addition, they provide a diversified income stream with the potential for both steady income growth and capital appreciation.
Within the dividend space, companies that regularly raise their payouts are more favored among investors. Given this, we will take a look at some of the best dividend growth stocks with over 10% dividend growth rate.
Our Methodology:
For this list, we used a Finviz stock screener and picked dividend companies with positive dividend growth rates in the past five years. From that group, we picked 13 stocks that have raised their dividends at an annual average rate of over 10% in the past five years and ranked them according to their dividend growth rates. We also considered hedge fund sentiment around each stock in Insider Monkey’s database, as of the third quarter of 2024.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).

5-Year Average Annual Dividend Growth Rate: 16.39%
Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) is a North Carolina-based home improvement retailer that offers a wide range of related products and services including hardware, tools, appliances, building materials, paint, plumbing supplies, and garden equipment. The company benefits from three main factors that continue to work in its favor. These are the rise in home prices, personal income growth outpacing inflation, and the fact that the average age of homes in the US is at its highest point in history. These factors are expected to drive ongoing demand for the company’s products, as homeowners are likely to keep investing in home improvements and repairs over the long term.
In January, Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) revealed it is now accepting project nominations for Lowe’s Hometowns, a five-year program with a $100 million investment in community revitalization. This year, the company plans to grant $10 million for 100 renovation projects and support 1,700 more projects selected by its employees. In addition, the company pledged $2 million to help with relief and recovery efforts for the Southern California wildfires, further demonstrating its dedication to assisting communities before, during, and after disasters.
Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) has a five-year average payout ratio of only 32.6%, making it one of the best dividend stocks. This conservative payout ratio has allowed the company to increase its dividends for 59 consecutive years. Moreover, the company has raised its payouts at an annual average rate of over 16.3% over the past five years. It offers a quarterly dividend of $1.15 per share for a dividend yield of 1.83%, as of February 8.
Overall LOW ranks 1st on our list of the best dividend stocks with dividend growth rates. While we acknowledge the potential for LOW as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LOW but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is an American credit card company, headquartered in New York. The company offers a wide range of payment processing and related services to its consumers. The company has earned investor trust thanks to its strong growth, significant competitive advantage, and resilience in tough economic conditions.

In the fourth quarter of 2024, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) reported revenue of $7.5 billion, which showed a 14% growth from the same period last year.

UPDATED: As noted throughout the weekend, the big story coming from this international box office frame is the wild performance of Chinese blockbuster Ne Zha 2 and its record-breaking run as it became the first movie to ever gross $1B in a single market. Current Maoyan estimates have the title at RMB 8B ($1.1B) through today in China.

	Based on those figures, the sequel is already the No. 7 animated film ever worldwide. Maoyan has again increased its projection for the full run in China, now forecasting RMB 12B ($1.65B). These projections tend to fluctuate, but if Ne Zha 2 were to reach that number, it would propel the film to become the No. 2 animated movie ever globally and the No. 11 film overall. Recall, that would be without any input from markets outside China where Ne Zha 2 begins rollout this week, including in the U.S. Watch this space.

Okay, so Tubi garnered quite a lot of attention these days. With the upcoming Super Bowl LIX livestream, people are looking for ways not to miss it. Thankfully, Tubi broadcasts the event from start to end in Full HD and English commentary.
However, if you’re outside the US, you’ll find the streaming service inaccessible. It’ll either be a strange error message or you won’t be able to watch anything.Â So, is there a way to watch Tubi abroad? Yes!
In fact, people online have come up with a clever solution to access and use Tubi anywhere without limits. Best of all – the solution is free and you can enjoy Super Bowl 2025 without losing a cent!
Tubi is a US TV channel, which operates under strict rules.Â These “rules” are licensing agreements that allow the platform to work exclusively in the US. Go abroad and you’ll notice the error that appears each time you try to visit it.
In simple terms, the platform accepts visitors only from the US, and to determine if the user is located there, it needs an IP address.
Do you have a US IP address? In that case, you can use the website.
If the IP address is from anywhere else, the error is displayed and your access is forbidden. However, there’s a way to watch Tubi live outside the US by using a VPN. You saw it coming, did you?
Watch Tubi live with NordVPN
We wonât pretend this is our ideaâitâs not. People online have found that using NordVPN is the most popular option and has yielded excellent results for website unblocking. For your information, NordVPN has over 2,000 US servers, allowing users to get an IP address from this country.
How?Â By subscribing to the service and connecting to a US VPN server.
Their IP address would then be hidden and replaced with an American one, which would, in turn, provide access to Tubi abroad. Americans found this solution suitable for vacations and business trips outside the United States.
This meant they could still enjoy all the content available on the platform (live and on-demand), thousands of kilometers away from home. Now, we also mentioned that the workaround is free, despite NordVPN’s premium status.
Well, the VPN has an unconditional 30-day money-back guarantee, which allows each subscription to be refunded. As a result, users could enjoy NordVPN for a month for free and be reimbursed, not losing money in the end.
If you want to explore alternatives, we can also recommend checking out ExpressVPN or Private Internet Access. They also offer a 30-day money-back guarantee.
While the streaming service technically restricts access to foreign users due to licensing agreements, unblocking it overseas isnât illegal. That said, it is most likely against the platformâs terms of service. We do not encourage you to do so in any way; proceed at your own discretion.
That being said, millions of people use VPNs for streaming on different platforms. Some watch Netflix, some look for out-of-market NFL games, and so on.
Since you’re likely looking to stream the Super Bowl LIX live, it’s not a great time to be hesitant. Try out this popular workaround and enjoy the 4-hour show.
We’ll see how good the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles will be. Oh, and how well will Kendrick Lamar get the crowd hyped up during halftime show – that’s also important!

Executive leaders recently identified cyber and technology risk as primary threats to business growth, according to a survey from insurer Chubb. More than 40% of executive respondents noted that cyber threat monitoring is an essential function within their organization.
That percentage will likely rise as the cybersecurity landscape gets more complex. A World Economic Forum analysis cites several factors that are creating more complexity. They include hackers’ use of AI technology, rising geopolitical tensions and the increase in data protection regulations.
This fast-changing environment creates opportunities for the best cybersecurity stocks to thrive. Proven cybersecurity providers will become invaluable to their customers and gain pricing power as a result.
To benefit from these trends, consider adding targeted cybersecurity exposure to your portfolio. Read on to meet six cybersecurity stocks with growth potential in 2025 and beyond.
Identifying these best cybersecurity stock picks began with listing all holdings within WisdomTree Cybersecurity Fund (WCBR) and Global X Cybersecurity ETF (BUG). From that group, stocks with these qualities were removed from consideration:
The remaining nine cybersecurity stocks were ordered by free cash flow (FCF) per share—highest to lowest—and the bottom three were dropped. FCF was calculated from each company's most recent year-end financial releases as operating cash flow less capital expenditures or capex. Capex included purchases of property, plant and equipment and capitalized software costs.
The table below identifies six cybersecurity stocks poised for growth in 2025.
Read on to learn more about these cybersecurity companies and why they may be candidates for your portfolio. Bulleted metrics come from stockanalysis.com, except for the FCF per share, which was calculated from company financial releases.

Akamai Technologies provides cloud computing, content delivery and cybersecurity solutions. Application and API security, bot and abuse protection, infrastructure security and programs supporting a zero-trust strategy are part of the offering. A zero-trust security strategy assumes breach is possible within networks and verifies every transaction accordingly.
Akamai sells to financial companies, video streaming companies, healthcare providers, retailers, pharmaceuticals and the U.S. military.
Akamai has proven its ability to drive sales and earnings growth. Although the sales trajectory has been more linear than earnings, the company has the highest and most consistent operating margin among the stocks on this list.
Akamai is currently seeing momentum in security solutions and cloud computing. In its most recent earnings release, the company reported 17% quarter-over-quarter sales growth in these areas. Company-wide sales growth rose a more subdued 4%.
Going forward, analysts expect high-single-digit sales growth for Akamai through 2028, with annual EPS in the range of about $6.50 to nearly $10.
Zscaler operates a cloud security platform sold to customers on a subscription basis. Customers operate in various sectors, including household and personal products, banking, transportation, hospitality and biotech.
Zscaler says its inline security cloud platform is the world’s largest. The company launched in 2007 and has since produced impressive year-over-year sales growth. In the past three years, sales grew an average of 48% annually.
The profit side of the equation has been more challenging. Zscaler has not yet achieved GAAP earnings. However, the company does have strong cash flow and the second-highest FCF per share on this list. Cash flow production should continue, as the Zscaler team optimizes its already effective go-to-market and upsell strategies.
In the October 2024 quarter, Zscaler reported 26% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth on ""strong sales execution."" Operating cash flow was $291.9 million and 53% of revenue. The GAAP loss per share shrank to $30.7 million from $46.1 million in the prior year period.
Okta provides cloud-based workforce and customer identity solutions. The company is best known for its gateway service that allows authenticated users to access multiple applications with one login. Customers include more than half of Fortune 100 companies plus thousands of other organizations.
Okta has strong market positioning, good growth history and a solid customer list. Recently, the company has been focused on attracting more high-value contracts and innovating its offering to enhance upsell opportunities. For fiscal year 2025, the leadership team expects 15% sales growth and a FCF margin of 25%.
Admittedly, a 15% sales growth expectation doesn’t compare well to Okta's history. Annual sales growth from fiscal years 2019 to 2023 ranged from 40% to 55%. Fiscal 2024 sales growth was about 20%.
Data breaches have been a lingering problem for Okta. Incidents in 2022 and 2023 kept OKTA’s stock price low, as other tech stocks rebounded strongly from the 2022 tech sell-off. However, in a recent earnings call, the company said the 2023 breach was no longer affecting results quantifiably.
As a potential investor, you can assess Okta's breach history in two ways. You can assume Okta could repeat its mistakes, which would be bad for customers and shareholders. Or, you can interpret Okta's troubles as a possible buying opportunity for a company with some positives: Okta operates in a growing industry, produces more than $400 million annually in FCF and is nearing GAAP profitability.
Datadog sells technology monitoring and logging services. Customers use the platform to manage, troubleshoot and optimize their cloud-based IT infrastructure, including servers, applications and databases. The customer list includes Samsung, Shell, Deloitte, Comcast and Nasdaq.
In 2023, Grand View Research estimated the global cloud market value at $602.31 billion. The researcher also projected a CAGR of 21.2% between 2024 and 2030. That growth benefits Datadog, which has a strong market position in cloud security. The company’s platform also integrates with OpenAI so customers can track the usage and performance of their AI-based applications.
Stifel analysts recently downgraded DDOG due to uncertainty around the company’s potential in the AI monitoring space. However, Bank of America Securities analyst Koji Ikeda has a different view, as reported by Business Insider. Ikeda recently maintained a buy rating on DDOG stock and raised the price target—noting that the company's long-term prospects without AI are still promising.
For the September quarter, Datadog reported 26% higher sales quarter-over-quarter and strong growth in customers with annual recurring revenue of at least $100,000. The company also produced FCF of $204 million.
Elastic N.V. makes enterprise software that searches, analyzes, logs and visualizes data. The company is best known for its Elasticsearch application, used by popular apps like Uber, Instacart and Tinder. Elastic also offers an AI-powered security solution for detecting, investigating and responding to cybersecurity threats.
Analysts appreciate Elastic’s position in AI and cybersecurity, two fast-growing industries. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives has cited AI as the bigger growth engine for Elastic. Ives believes Elastic will see continued strong demand for its platform as the AI revolution continues.
Investors appreciate Elastic's habit of beating earnings expectations. In the first two quarters of fiscal 2025, Elastic outperformed the EPS consensus by 36% and 55%, respectively. Highlights from the second quarter include an 18% revenue gain, a 59% increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS and a 16% increase in the high-value customer count from the prior-year quarter. High-value customers are those with annual contract values over $100,000.
Rapid7 manages an AI-powered vulnerability management platform that can analyze network activity, proactively identify threats, test applications for security holes, monitor cloud resources and third-party integrations and respond to threats.
Rapid7 generates more than $820 million in annual recurring revenue and services more than 11,000 customers. While the company’s revenue growth has slowed recently, Rapid7 has also recently achieved GAAP profitability—a milestone in the cybersecurity space. After producing a GAAP net loss of $149 million in 2023, the company has delivered GAAP net income of $46.9 million over the last 12 months.
However, analyst Adam Borg of Stifel Nicolaus is cautious about Rapid7’s growth prospects. Borg says the vulnerability management niche within cybersecurity may not provide the growth investors want to see from Rapid7. Despite Borg's opinion, the average analyst earnings outlook for Rapid7 is positive. Estimates show steady EPS growth from $2.31 in 2024 to $4.02 in 2029.
In the third quarter 2024, Rapid7 grew sales 8% year-over-year, and produced FCF of $39 million.
Technology and geopolitical trends may create tailwinds for cybersecurity stocks in the coming years. The most effective providers will benefit the most. To add cybersecurity exposure to your portfolio, look for companies with strong growth records and improving profitability. You can alternatively opt for a cybersecurity ETF that spreads risk out over a few dozen securities.

We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Long-term Stocks to Invest in for High Returns. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) stands against the other stocks.
The global economy seems to be at a point where fiscal ambition intersects with market skepticism, says Oakglen Wealth. Donald Trump’s presidential election and the Republican takeover of the US Senate and retention of the House of Representatives resulted in a complicated mix of policy goals. Notably, the broader market’s initial reaction hints at positivity given Trump’s plans for growth, hinting at the continued outperformance of US assets in the year ahead.
Fidelity has an optimistic view of the financial sector, primarily because of steady economic growth for the broader US economy. Since the financial sector is cyclical, the sector’s performance is mainly a function of the strength of the broader economy. The US economy has been showing momentum and a path towards the desired “soft landing,” says Fidelity. Therefore, worries about a mild recession (which could have impacted the financial stocks) are alleviated. One significant difference in market dynamics entering 2025, in comparison to recent years, is the outlook on interest rates.
The H2 2024 began a new rate cycle, with the US Fed cutting rates for the first time since the initial days of the pandemic. Banks might benefit from higher interest rates due to higher NIMs. On the other hand, lower rates can help boost confidence and decrease the pressure on economic growth, which is expected to be beneficial for virtually all industries in this sector, opines Fidelity. Within equities, Franklin Templeton has an optimistic outlook on IT, health care, energy, consumer staples, and industrial sectors.

As per Russell Investments, the US economy is resilient as it enters 2025, but the road ahead is expected to be affected by shifting policy dynamics. On the positive side, tax cuts and deregulation can offer a meaningful growth boost, mainly to domestic and cyclical sectors. The investment firm believes that companies leveraging AI technologies to enhance productivity—mainly in industrials and healthcare— are expected to see material improvements to operating fundamentals.
Even though the mega-cap AI stocks have fueled the market returns over recent years, leadership has been shifting to companies leveraging AI to develop real-world efficiencies. Russell Investments believes that the Trump administration’s policies offer a delicate balancing act. It assumes that the new administration will not aggressively pursue policies that can create inflation risk.
Our Methodology

Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) is engaged in designing, manufacturing, testing, and marketing integrated circuits (ICs), software, and subsystems products. CFRA analyst Angelo Zino upgraded the company’s stock from 'Buy' to 'Strong Buy,' while maintaining a price objective of $250.00. As per the analyst, the new capacity additions are expected to drive long-term growth, together with industrial advancements in instrumentation, testing, and factory automation.
Notably, the automotive sector is expected to act as Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI)’s most significant growth opportunity, with its products in battery management systems, audio systems, and connectivity acting as potential drivers. The analyst also opines that stable pricing for Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI)’s products and a rebound can enable it to increase returns to investors.  The company continues to make strategic, long-term investments throughout engineering, manufacturing, and the end-to-end customer experience.
For Q1 2025, Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) projects revenue of $2.35 billion (+/- $100 million). At the midpoint of this revenue outlook, the company anticipates a reported operating margin of ~22.0% (+/- 130 bps), and an adjusted operating margin of ~40.0% (+/- 100 bps). Carillon Tower Advisers, an investment management company, released its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:
“Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) rebounded as management teams at several semiconductor companies in the analog space called the bottom, seeing improved conditions ahead. The analog semiconductor industry is a very cyclical business that has underperformed the broader semiconductor industry for several years.”
Overall ADI ranks 9th on our list of the best long-term stocks to invest in for high returns. While we acknowledge the potential of ADI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than ADI but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Most chairs are designed for the everyday act of sitting – at a desk, relaxing, or enjoying a meal.  But what about those who require a more dynamic and specialized seating experience?  Painters, for example, often work on vertical canvases, require a chair that offers mobility, support, and freedom of movement.  Industrial design student Teo Primo Frizzarin recognized this need and developed the “Leo” chair, a concept specifically designed for artists.
Designer: Teo Primo Frizzarin 






Frizzarin, studying at ECAL (University of Art and Design Lausanne), focused his efforts on creating a chair that caters to the unique demands of working with a vertical surface.  The Leo chair aims to provide painters with enhanced mobility and crucial arm support, essential for the creation of their masterpieces.  The name itself, “Leo,” likely evokes the legacy of Leonardo da Vinci, hinting at the chair’s artistic purpose. The Leo chair draws inspiration from the form and function of a horse saddle. This design provides a stable seat while simultaneously granting the user greater freedom of movement compared to a traditional chair. 

You get a conventional looking backrest but it also appears to be an arm support, which is probably what’s needed more. This support is not only adjustable in height but also in position, accommodating the varied postures and angles painters adopt while working.  This adaptability is key, as artists often shift their positions and reach across the canvas as their work progresses. The prototype of the Leo chair showcases its mobility-enhancing features, including integrated wheels.  These wheels allow the artist to easily maneuver around their workspace, retrieving paints, brushes, solvents, or other materials without needing to stand up and disrupt their creative flow.  This thoughtful detail addresses the practical needs of painters who often require quick access to a variety of tools and supplies.






Frizzarin’s innovative design earned him a “Très Bien” mention for his diploma project, suggesting a promising future for the Leo chair.  This recognition underscores the potential market for specialized furniture that caters to the specific requirements of artists.  Currently, painters often rely on standard chairs, rolling chairs, or swivel chairs, none of which are perfectly optimized for the demands of their craft. The Leo chair offers a compelling alternative, potentially revolutionizing the way artists interact with their workspace. While still a concept, the Leo chair represents a significant step towards a more ergonomic and artist-centric approach to furniture design.  It raises the question:  will the Leo chair become the new standard for artists’ seating, or will it inspire further innovation in this often-overlooked area of design?

By buying an index fund, investors can approximate the average market return. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the Food Empire Holdings Limited (SGX:F03) share price is up 44% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 1.0% (not including dividends).
Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.
 View our latest analysis for Food Empire Holdings 
While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.
Food Empire Holdings was able to grow its EPS at 30% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. The average annual share price increase of 13% is actually lower than the EPS growth. Therefore, it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth, somewhat. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 7.12 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.
You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).
Dive deeper into Food Empire Holdings' key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Food Empire Holdings's earnings, revenue and cash flow.
As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Food Empire Holdings' TSR for the last 3 years was 71%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!
Investors in Food Empire Holdings had a tough year, with a total loss of 24% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 23%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 11% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Food Empire Holdings , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. Take, for example Metro Bank Holdings PLC (LON:MTRO). Its share price is already up an impressive 232% in the last twelve months. It's also good to see the share price up 24% over the last quarter. However, the stock hasn't done so well in the longer term, with the stock only up 1.0% in three years.
So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.
 Check out our latest analysis for Metro Bank Holdings 
Metro Bank Holdings isn't currently profitable, so most analysts would look to revenue growth to get an idea of how fast the underlying business is growing. Shareholders of unprofitable companies usually desire strong revenue growth. Some companies are willing to postpone profitability to grow revenue faster, but in that case one would hope for good top-line growth to make up for the lack of earnings.
Metro Bank Holdings grew its revenue by 5.6% last year. That's not a very high growth rate considering it doesn't make profits. In contrast, the share price took off during the year, gaining 232%. We're happy that investors have made money, though we wonder if the increase will be sustained. We're not so sure that revenue growth is driving the market optimism about the stock.
The company's revenue and earnings (over time) are depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).
It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. So we recommend checking out this free report showing consensus forecasts
It's nice to see that Metro Bank Holdings shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 232% over the last year. There's no doubt those recent returns are much better than the TSR loss of 8% per year over five years. This makes us a little wary, but the business might have turned around its fortunes. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Metro Bank Holdings better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  Metro Bank Holdings is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...
There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares. You probably do not want to miss this free list of undervalued small cap companies that insiders are buying.

The H2 2024 began a new rate cycle, with the US Fed cutting rates for the first time since the initial days of the pandemic. Banks might benefit from higher interest rates due to higher NIMs. On the other hand, lower rates can help boost confidence and decrease the pressure on economic growth, which is expected to be beneficial for virtually all industries in this sector, opines Fidelity. Within equities, Franklin Templeton has an optimistic outlook on IT, health care, energy, consumer staples, and industrial sectors.

As per Russell Investments, the US economy is resilient as it enters 2025, but the road ahead is expected to be affected by shifting policy dynamics. On the positive side, tax cuts and deregulation can offer a meaningful growth boost, mainly to domestic and cyclical sectors. The investment firm believes that companies leveraging AI technologies to enhance productivity—mainly in industrials and healthcare— are expected to see material improvements to operating fundamentals.
Even though the mega-cap AI stocks have fueled the market returns over recent years, leadership has been shifting to companies leveraging AI to develop real-world efficiencies. Russell Investments believes that the Trump administration’s policies offer a delicate balancing act. It assumes that the new administration will not aggressively pursue policies that can create inflation risk.
Our Methodology
To list the 12 Best Long-term Stocks to Invest in for High Returns, we sifted through several financial media reports related to the best long-term stocks to buy. After getting an initial list of 20 stocks, we chose the ones which analysts saw the most upside to. Finally, the stocks were ranked in ascending order of their average upside potential, as of February 6. We also mentioned the hedge fund sentiments around each stock, as of Q3 2024.
At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading designer of discrete graphics processing units that enhance the experience on computing platforms. Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley gave an “Overweight” rating on the company’s stock, providing a price target of $152. The analyst noted that China’s DeepSeek, an AI model matching its American rivals in performance and at a much cheaper cost, established some challenges for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) around export controls and longer-term investment. Despite these challenges, Moore opines that near-term checks remain strong for its Hopper platform. The analyst believes that Blackwell’s supply visibility has been building and that customers’ desire to spend remains clearly visible.
Elsewhere, Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial upped the company’s stock to “Strong Buy,” raising its price objective to $220. Even though DeepSeek's R1 AI model has been claiming competitive features at lower costs, Tigress Financial noted unknown capabilities and security concerns. The firm lauded NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s critical role in AI and data center growth and sees it as a long-term beneficiary of continued investments. Furthermore, lawmakers in the US have plans to ban DeepSeek.
The AI infrastructure build-out continues to act as a major tailwind for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Notably, cloud service providers, sovereign states, and consumer internet companies have been fueling demand for AI computing power. Fred Alger Management, an investment management company, released its Q4 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:
“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for a variety of end markets, such as gaming, PCs, data centers, virtual reality, and high-performance computing. The company is leading in most secular growth categories in computing, and especially artificial intelligence and super-computing parallel processing techniques for solving complex computational problems. In our view, Nvidia’s computational power is a critical enabler of AI and therefore essential to AI adoption. Shares contributed to performance during the quarter, driven by strong demand for its data center products, especially the Hopper H200 chips, which generated double-digit billions in revenue, marking the fastest product ramp in the company’s history. Management provided fiscal fourth-quarter revenue guidance above analyst estimates, along with resilient operating margins supported by robust demand and limited competition. In our view, Nvidia’s leadership in scaling AI infrastructure, including advancements in inference and test-time scaling (i.e., reasoning during inference), is driving adoption among enterprises and startups, providing continued demand for its high-performance chips and software solutions. As older-generation chips are repurposed for inference and new clusters are deployed, we believe Nvidia is well-positioned to capitalize on growing compute needs across AI applications.”
Overall NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best long-term stocks to invest in for high returns. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

55,2025-02-09,"Travelers looking for something a little off the beaten path have a new flight option to Italy's Puglia region, an area known for its proximity to the Adriatic Sea, delectable food and historic medieval architecture.
Neos, the airline owned by Italian travel company Alpitour, will launch what it says is the first-ever nonstop service between Bari Karol Wojtyła Airport (BRI) in the capital of Puglia and New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) on June 3. Initially, the flight will only depart New York on Tuesdays (Bari on Wednesdays) and operate through Oct. 15.
Neos will operate a Boeing 787-9 with 255 seats on the route. Its Dreamliners are configured with 28 ""premium"" seats similar to premium economy on other airlines, plus 327 economy seats, including 36 adults-only Economy Extra Plus seats and 18 Economy Extra seats, both of which offer extra legroom.

""New York-Bari is much more than an air link,"" Michele Emiliano, president of the Puglia region, said in a statement. ""It is an embrace between Puglia and the world, a bridge that unites traditions, affection, heritage and opportunity, especially as many Americans are proud of their families' roots in Puglia.""
While it might be far-flung for some travelers, Puglia was named one of The New York Times' 52 Places to Go in 2019. The newspaper highlighted the region's baroque architecture, culinary traditions and coastal Gargano National Park as some of its many reasons to visit.
Flights and seats to Bari, Puglia's main airport, grew by double digits — 21% and 31%, respectively — from 2019 to 2024, schedule data from aviation analytics firm Cirium shows. Ryanair drove much of that growth, adding over 2 million seats in the market during the period.
However, almost all of Bari's new flights are within Europe. In 2024, the airport's only intercontinental services were to the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Israel.

The new Neos flight stands to change that. If successful, the airline could add more flights in 2026. It could also signal to competitors like Delta Air Lines and United Airlines that Bari is a market Americans want to visit and prompt them to launch their own transatlantic nonstops.
Below are details of Neos' new Bari-New York nonstop:

U.S. markets were seeing volatility as technology earnings began to worry investors due to soft forecasts and mounting AI-related expenses. To offset volatility, long-term investors are expected to pile into quality dividend stocks. But which companies can help you achieve a diversified income stream? Let's turn to a case study for ideas.
This month, someone asked income investors living off their dividends to share their portfolio details on r/Dividends — a Reddit discussion board with more than 670,000 followers. Many investors shared interesting portfolios and income reports, but one comment caught our eye.

An investor said he was making about $4,300 per month, or $51,950 per year. His portfolio yield was around 6.6%.
""Supplements my social security income...have had this portfolio since retired 5 years now...dividends have been consistent and stable,"" the investor, 68, said.
Let's take a look at some of the key dividend stocks and funds in the investor's portfolio based on the details he shared publicly on the social media platform.
Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF
Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF (NASDAQ:QYLD)  was one of the stocks in the portfolio of the investor collecting about $4,300 a month in dividends. The investor revealed in a separate comment that the fund was in his IRA account and ""supplements"" his monthly income.
Trending: Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum. 
Global X Russell 2000 Covered Call ETF
Global X Russell 2000 Covered Call ETF (NYSE:RYLD) was another important dividend fund in the portfolio. RYLD generates income by selling call options on the small-cap-heavy Russell 2000 Index. The ETF yields about 12%. Being a covered call ETF, RYLD is also not risk-free and often posts losses during down markets. The ETF is now in the limelight as analysts believe small-cap stocks will be among the top beneficiaries of an easing monetary environment.
NEOS Nasdaq-100 Hedged Equity Income ETF 
The NEOS Nasdaq-100 Hedged Equity Income ETF (NASDAQ:NUSI) generates income by selling call options on the Nasdaq-100. The fund has a monthly distribution rate of 8.7%. NUSI is up 13% over the past year.
JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF 
JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSE:JEPI) makes money by investing in some of the most notable large-cap U.S. stocks and selling call options. JEPI is ideal for those looking for exposure to defensive stocks. JEPI usually underperforms during bull markets and protects investors against huge losses during bear markets since most of its portfolio consists of large, defensive equities like Trane Technologies PLC (NYSE:TT), Southern Co (NYSE:SO), Progressive Corp (NYSE:PGR), among many others.

The fund’s top holdings include AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), AT&T (NYSE:T),  Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED), Invesco (NYSE:IVZ), and Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN), among many others.
Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF
The investor earning about $4,300 in monthly dividends had Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE:SCHD) in his portfolio. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index and provides exposure to some of the top dividend stocks trading in the U.S., including AbbVie, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Since SCHD's holdings are mostly conservative dividend payers, it's suitable for investors close to retirement looking for consistent dividend income.

We recently published a list of 10 Firms That Soared Last Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Teladoc Health, Inc. (NYSE:TDOC) stands against other firms that soared last week.
Last week saw volatile trading in the stock market as investors scrambled to react from a series of positive and negative catalysts which sparked buying and selling positions across the board.
On Friday alone, Wall Street’s major indices fell into the red territory over renewed fears of growing trade tensions from some of the world’s largest economies, coupled with expectations of a higher inflation rate.
However, 10 firms defied a broader market slump, posting impressive gains in just a week’s trading.
To come up with last week’s biggest advancers, we considered only the stocks with at least $2 billion in market capitalization and $5 million in daily trading volume.

Shares of Teladoc Health, Inc. (NYSE:TDOC) jumped 27.46 percent week-on-week to end at $12.95 apiece on Friday as investor sentiment was boosted by an analyst’s bullish outlook for the company following its acquisition of Catapult Health.
In a recent report, Citron Research underscored TDOC’s potential following its buyout of Catapult Health for $65 million and its effective use of technology to enhance profitability and expand margins.
Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) acquired Catapult Health last week, in line with its efforts to improve early detection of health conditions, expand into at-home diagnostic testing, and deliver better health outcomes in care management that would complement its industry-leading suite of integrated solutions.
Subject to customary closing conditions, the transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025.

Everything was looking up for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Until it wasn't.
The Lakers made the biggest splash ahead of Thursday's NBA trade deadline when they acquired Luka Dončić from the Dallas Mavericks in a move that cost them Anthony Davis. While it set the Purple and Gold up with a star for the foreseeable future seeing how Dončić is just 25 years old, it also left them with a hole in the frontcourt.
It was a hole they appeared to fill by landing big man Mark Williams from the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for Dalton Knecht, Cam Reddish, a 2031 unprotected first-round pick and a 2030 pick swap.
However, ESPN's Shams Charania reported Saturday that the Williams trade was rescinded because the center failed his physical exam due to ""multiple issues.""
The question now is what do the Lakers do next with a thin frontcourt that might not be ready for a long playoff run, and the answers aren't that easy since the trade deadline has now passed. They will instead have to turn to the buyout market if they want to add depth beyond Jaxson Hayes.
With that in mind, here are some possible buyout targets.

There is a former Lakers big man who could catch lobs from Dončić who could be available to play a role off the bench.
JaVale McGee is playing in Puerto Rico and is someone who might be open to a return to Los Angeles. He suited up for the team for two seasons in 2018-19 and 2019-20 and even appeared in 14 playoff games during its 2020 championship run
That was the third title of McGee's career after he previously won two with the Golden State Warriors.
He is certainly playoff-tested with 74 postseason games on his resume and could provide energy in short spurts off the bench. He appeared in 46 games for the Sacramento Kings last season and shot 59.8 percent from the field.
It would be yet another stop for the veteran journeyman, but he is a familiar name for the Lakers, played in the postseason alongside James in the past, previously played with Dončić in Dallas and would provide some much-needed depth for the stretch run.

Mo Bamba is another option who could be a lob threat playing with Dončić.
Bamba is available after the Utah Jazz waived him earlier this season, and he would give the Lakers more athleticism and rim protection if they decided to add him. What's more, he is a familiar name since he played with the Purple and Gold during the 2022-23 season.
The No. 6 overall pick of the 2018 NBA draft has failed to live up to the lofty expectations that came with such a draft designation, but he is a solid rebounder and can block shots defensively.
He appeared in 28 games for the L.A. Clippers this season and averaged 4.6 points, 4.3 rebounds and 1.0 blocks in 12.6 minutes a night.
That type of production and the ability to catch lobs from Dončić would work well in short spurts off the bench for the Lakers.

If the Lakers want to go with the approach of adding the best player available and worry about team fit later, they could do much worse than veteran Daniel Theis.
Theis is available after the Oklahoma City Thunder waived him to create room on their roster, and he is someone who could provide valuable depth for Los Angeles down the stretch. He appeared in 38 games for the New Orleans Pelicans this season and averaged 4.3 points and 4.3 rebounds a night.
The 32-year-old is playoff tested with 41 postseason games on his resume and could stretch the floor if needed as a 32.6 percent shooter from deep in his career. Playing with LeBron James and Dončić leads to plenty of space, and he is someone who could take advantage of that.
Still, he also isn't the lob threat to play center in an offense with Dončić dominating the ball.
That is notable since ESPN's Dave McMenamin reported the five-time All-NBA selection met with Los Angeles' front office and ""impressed upon them his desire to have"" a big man who is mobile and can catch lobs before the Williams trade.
Theis isn't that, which means the team may look elsewhere."

The New York Jets' Aaron Rodgers experiment has been a disaster and could end in the offseason.
According to Fox Sports' Jay Glazer, Rodgers met with the Jets, who informed him that they plan to move in a different direction at quarterback.
Glazer believes that Rodgers' decision to discuss his future with the team indicates that he plans to play in 2025, despite rumblings that the 20-year veteran could hang up his cleats in retirement.
From the perspective of quarterback need, several teams may be interested in Rodgers, who threw for 3,897 yards, 28 touchdowns and 11 interceptions with a 63 percent completion rate this past season.
Let's take a look at five landing spots for Rodgers.

The Athletic's James Boyd expects the Indianapolis Colts to roll with Anthony Richardson as their starting quarterback in 2025. But remember, the team had a quick hook for him this past season, benching the second-year signal-caller for Joe Flacco midway through the campaign.
With Rodgers reportedly set to hit the free-agent market, the Colts may look for a proven quarterback.
General manager Chris Ballard and head coach Shane Steichen could be on the hot seat heading into the 2025 term.
In eight seasons under Ballard, Indianapolis has a 62-69-1 record. Steichen is 17-17 as the club's lead skipper in two terms.
In recent years, the Colts have signed quarterbacks in the latter stages of their careers, such as Philip Rivers and Matt Ryan. Rodgers could be next in line.
In Indianapolis, Rodgers would have a decent offensive line, an All-Pro running back in Jonathan Taylor, and a solid receiver group that includes Michael Pittman Jr., Josh Downs, Alec Pierce, and Adonai Mitchell. He could move the needle for a stagnant Colts squad.

The Las Vegas Raiders may be the least likely of the possible landing spots for Rodgers, but they have a need at the position and $92.5 million in cap space.
The Raiders have a new general manager, John Spytek, and head coach, Pete Carroll.
When Carroll became the Seattle Seahawks head coach in 2010, he had 35-year-old Matt Hasselbeck as his starting quarterback. Spytek was in Tampa Bay when Tom Brady, a minority stakeholder with the Raiders, signed with the Buccaneers at 42 years old.
So, the Raiders may not oppose bringing in Rodgers, even at his age, as an upgrade over Aidan O'Connell and Gardner Minshew.
That said, if Rodgers wants to bring Davante Adams along with him to his next destination, it may be a bit difficult to convince the three-time All-Pro receiver to return to Las Vegas after he requested a trade from the team back in October.
Rodgers would have star rookie tight end Brock Bowers, but he would have to be OK with the plan for a rebuilding offense under new play-caller Chip Kelly.

The New York Giants don't have a quarterback under contract in 2025. If they're interested in Rodgers, he could stay in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and be the clear-cut starter for Big Blue.
The Giants have the No. 3 overall pick in the draft, but they're behind two teams, the Tennessee Titans and Cleveland Browns, that may take quarterbacks.
The Titans watched Will Levis struggle through his second term. Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson has torn his Achilles twice since October.
The Giants can wait to see how the draft order shakes out or take a proactive approach to addressing the position during free agency.
Also, Rodgers told reporters he would be open to mentoring a young quarterback. Thus, the Giants can sign him as the bridge-gap signal-caller and still take a passer with the No. 3 overall pick to solidify their short- and long-term plans at the position.

The Pittsburgh Steelers are the best fit for Rodgers. At 41, he could play with a playoff team and bring two-time teammate Davante Adams for the ride.
The Steelers have question marks at quarterback and wide receiver.
Fox Sports analyst Jay Glazer doesn't believe Russell Wilson will be back in Pittsburgh. Barring an early extension, Justin Fields will be a free agent in March.
Steelers owner Art Rooney II has highlighted the wide receiver group as a position of need.
""I think we have positions in the wide receiver room we're going to have to address"" and ""I think the wide receiver room is an area we've got to look at improving,"" Rooney said to reporters.
The Steelers have the foundation to bring in a couple of star players, Rodgers and Adams, and make it work for the short term as they try to get over the one-and-done playoff hump.

The Tennessee Titans can address the quarterback position in many different ways. They have the No. 1 overall pick and $44 million in cap space.
While some expect the Titans to take a quarterback with the first pick, ESPN's Dan Graziano pumped the brakes on that thought.
""There is still a long way to go until April's draft and a lot of evaluations to make before then, but I've talked to multiple people who think the Titans could trade out of the top pick and look for their QB solution elsewhere,"" Graziano wrote.
When the dust settles, Tennessee will probably select Miami product Cam Ward, though the club may consider Rodgers if it feels that none of the quarterbacks in the class are ready to start as rookies.
With Rodgers in the fold, the Titans can take an old-school approach with their quarterback plan and sit a rookie for a year full year or two, or they can pass on this class and go with a bridge-gap option for the short term.

We recently published a list of 10 Best Human Resources Stocks To Invest In. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) stands against other best human resources stocks to invest in.
According to a report by Reuters on January 23, the number of citizens in the United States applying for unemployment benefits rose slightly during the week before the release of this report. The subtle change emphasized no decline in labor market conditions. In addition to that, the report highlighted that while layoffs were particularly low, the opportunities available to people finding new jobs remained scarce and limited.
The Labor Department reported that the jobless rolls surged to the highest level in over three years during early January. For the week ended January 18, claims for state unemployment benefits increased by 6,000 to reach 223,000. On the contrary, economists polled by Reuters were expecting claims to reach 220,00. The gap can be explained by a surge in claims after the wildfires occurred in Los Angeles, with undocumented claims being even higher.
More recently, on February 5, Reuters reported that job openings fell by the most in 14 months in December 2024 but the relatively stable hiring situation pointed towards a steady labor market. The Labor Department’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey suggested that for every unemployed person, there were 1.1 job openings available in December, down from 1.15 in November 2024. While this does put a serious question mark on the Fed’s easing cycle, it also raises concerns over the stability of the US economy and its future.
By the last day of December, job openings fell by 556,000 to reach 7.6 million, the largest decline since October 2023. The decline in job openings points towards uncertainty around the new administration’s policies and a general lack of confidence, especially with incoming decisions like mass deportations and broad tariffs, leaving businesses more cautious than ever. In addition to that, policymakers are also extremely cautious, given that they believe most policies are inflationary, reducing the chances of an easing cycle being continued as planned.
With the growing need for job opportunities, the demand for human resource companies and experts is at an all-time high.
To come up with the names with sifted through multiple rankings available on the internet, and compiled a list of stocks in the industry. We then selected the following human resources stocks based on the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock as of Q3 2024 and picked the most popular ones. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 49
Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) ranks third on our list of the best human resources stocks to invest in. ADP is a management service company that provides human resources management services, tax services, online payroll services, and tax solutions. The company provides recruiting and hiring services, talent management services, activation services, retirement plans, and workers’ compensation services. ADP has as its mission to optimize operations for businesses such that forecasting budgeting, and scheduling become extremely simple.
The company recently released results for its fiscal second quarter of 2025. By the end of the quarter, Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) had more than 1.1 million clients across 140 countries, managed by nearly 64,000 global ADP associates. The company also now delivers payroll for more than 42 million workers across the globe. During the quarter, ADP generated $19.2 billion in revenue, up from $15 billion in the fiscal year 2021.
As of now, the company’s total addressable market stands at $175 billion, and expects its market to grow by 5-6% in the fiscal year 2025 and beyond. This explains why hedge funds were bullish on the stock, given that 49 hedge funds held stakes in ADP at the close of Q3 2024.
Overall, ADP ranks 3rd on our list of best human resources stocks to invest in. While we acknowledge the potential of ADP to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than ADP but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

You might be wondering, “Which one should I take home?” The Saros 10R is the perfect companion for users with complex home layouts. The Saros 10, on the other hand, is the go-to choice if you’re prioritizing deep cleaning performance in larger homes.

65,2025-02-09,"Sunday morning. The sun is out, the birds are chirping, our alarm clocks are off, and even our cats seem to be taking a break from driving us crazy and enjoying the calmness of the moment. It's purrfect. Almost. Sunday morning would not be Funday morning if we didn't start it with a bunch of hissterical cat memes. It simply wouldn't. So, here we are, continuing a tradition that deserves to be continued - starting Sunday with a bunch of silly cat memes. 
It's important, as we all know, to start Sunday on the right paw. It's impurrtant to begin the day with a smile and a laugh so that we could stock up on as many good vibes as pawssible for the week to come. And funny cat memes are something that always makes us smile. Always - without fail. And since we already know you guys, we know that they have the same effect on you. We know that you will enjoy scrolling through these as much as we enjoyed putting them together. Have a great Sunday, y'all! 
And you know what? Troy is amazing for this. Troy is so happy and and safe and secure in his home that he never even thought about honing the correct instincts for this kind of moment. In Troy's mind, this flying thing is just another toy for him to play with an enjoy, not something that requires effort or anything. 
Honestly… you should have known this would happen. We learned very quickly that looking away from your cat when there is food around is a fatal mistake. Do it at your own risk. Every cat owner learns this. And yep, this person learned. The hard way, yes, but they learned.

        Almost 200 readers have now noticed long runtimes on their new Seagate hard disks. Reports from abroad are also increasing.
      

      (Image: Seagate)
    
Recently, many online retailers have sent out Seagate hard disks as new that have already been running somewhere for many, many hours. As yet unknown fraudsters had reset the SMART values of used drives and smuggled them back into distribution via equally unknown channels. Official Seagate dealers are also affected.
However, Seagate server hard disks also log their runtimes and other parameters elsewhere: The so-called FARM values cannot (yet?) be reset by the fraudsters (FARM stands for Field Accessible Reliability Metrics). These can also be read out with the smartmontools or the Seagate Seatools. According to the readers, the affected drives have been in operation for an average of around 25,000 hours.
However, not only German customers are affected. We have received reports from Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg, the UK, the Czech Republic and the USA. The online retailer East Digital from Hong Kong is also said to be sending out such drives. They have now sold out of the drives, but apparently they often have such “special offers” in their program. We have also seen forum entries from Australian East Digital customers who are now also experiencing long FARM runtimes.
We have also received reports from Japan that the case is being reported there. We are happy to receive further information by e-mail –. If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can do so via our anonymous mailbox.
Where the slabs came from and how they got to Germany is still unclear. However, many such used drives are said to be on sale in China at the moment. These could come from former computing farms for the cryptocurrency Chia, which are now being shut down as farming such coins is no longer profitable: The energy costs are now higher than the expected profit.
The available storage space in this network was initially only a few exabytes, but later rose sharply. Since the summer of 2024, the storage space in the Chia network has been decreasing, from around 34 exabytes at the time to around 19 exabytes now. The loss of around 15 exabytes corresponds to around one million hard disks with a gross capacity of 16 TByte. Not all of these will come from Seagate; however, the manufacturer currently has a share of more than 40 percent of the hard disk market. Roughly speaking, more than 400,000 used Seagate drives with 16 TByte could have been discarded from the Chia farms.
The message from an affected person in a forum fits in with this. When asked, Seagate stated that his hard disk was originally sold to a Chinese company from Mongolia. Seagate's German representative is not so forthcoming about the origin of the drives, citing data protection and assuring that the company is not involved in the scam.
Some of the disks still have a few months of warranty left, but most of them have long since expired. Many were sold as part of a larger system – and therefore as so-called OEM disks, for which the manufacturer provides no warranty. If they were sold in a Dell system, for example, then Dell is responsible for the warranty processing in this system, it is effectively no longer a Seagate disk.
Many of our readers have complained, even long before these cases of fraud, about the practice of dealers selling OEM disks without a manufacturer's warranty. We therefore recommend that you visit the warranty inquiries of the dealers immediately after receiving a drive and check the status (Seagate, Toshiba, Western Digital). The serial number is sometimes already noted on the invoice and can otherwise be read through the anti-static packaging before it is opened; this also allows the production date to be identified. If this is several years in the past, caution is advised and a return is at least worth considering.

We recently published a list of Was Jim Cramer Right About These 12 Stocks?. In this article, we are going to take a look at where McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 6 months ago during his show on July 29, 2024, and examine whether he was right or wrong about those stocks.
Back then, Cramer was talking about the “great broadening” which he described as the event where every stock was rallying except for the large cap stocks. He said:
“This market is not experiencing a small cap rally, it’s experiencing a rally in everything else but the tech titans.”
He also pointed out that many small-cap stocks were being bought indiscriminately through index funds like the Russell 2000, the S&P Small Cap 600, and the S&P Mid Cap 400.
“The big institutions don’t have time to examine all these different small-cap stocks, they just buy the index itself as an entity because it’s still historically cheap, even after this rally.”
That’s the essence of the broadening—some real treasures and some real trash getting scooped up together. He then explained:
“The treasure being companies that do better when interest rates go down like when the Fed starts cutting.”
Unlike the cash-rich tech giants that don’t need lower interest rates, small caps benefit tremendously from falling rates. That’s why investors were selling their big-tech winners from earlier in the year and cycling into cheaper small-cap stocks.
Jim Cramer was particularly enthusiastic about this narrative back then and said that investors should “celebrate the market’s good breadth”.
For this article, we compiled a list of 12 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on July 29, 2024. We then calculated their performance from July 29th, 2024, market close to February 4th, 2025, market close. We have also included the hedge fund sentiment for the stocks, which we sourced from Insider Monkey’s Q3 2024 database of over 900 hedge funds. The stocks are listed in the order that Cramer mentioned them.
Note: This article covers Jim Cramer’s commentary from July 29, 2024, and does not account for any changes in his opinions regarding the stocks mentioned. Therefore, the commentary should not be mistaken for his latest opinions on any of the stocks that are mentioned.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).
Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 60
McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD) had reported weak same-store sales back then, missing both revenue and earnings expectations. But instead of getting punished, the stock jumped nearly 4%. But Cramer wasn’t buying the optimism, saying:
“Frankly, nobody was truly disappointed by McDonald’s because everyone expected them to have bad numbers.”
The company had rolled out a $5 value meal plan to spark demand, but Cramer saw it as a desperation move:
“The fact that McDonald’s would kick out a plan to return to growth was enough to get everyone excited.”
However, the stock is up 11% since the episode aired in July, which shows that McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) growth has, in fact, been working so far.
Overall, MCD ranks 12th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discussed 6 months ago. While we acknowledge the potential of MCD as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MCD but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

74,2025-02-09,"The US president's tariffs on Chinese exports have some leaders concerned Thailand could be the next victim of his mercurial commerce policy, especially as the country has one of the largest trade surpluses with America
PUBLISHED : 10 Feb 2025 at 05:42
NEWSPAPER SECTION: Business
WRITER: 
                            Post Reporters
The stock market fluctuated, gold prices surged, and oil prices fell as global markets reacted to renewed trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, while the Thai bourse felt the ripple effects last week as it plunged.
While the US delayed tariff hikes on Canada and Mexico, President Donald Trump's decision to raise tariffs on China by 10% was met with an immediate retaliation from Beijing, which imposed equal tariffs on products from the US.
Local economists and business operators are bracing for a more critical impact to the Thai economy, which is dependent on the US and China.
Rak Vorrakitpokatorn, president of the Export-Import Bank of Thailand, said following the imposition of tariffs on China and indications the EU could be the next target, it is crucial to monitor any anti-dumping and countervailing duty measures on Thai products.
Thailand was hit with these trade penalties for solar panels, as China relocated its production base to Thailand to avoid US tariffs, he said.
""China maintains lower production costs and logistics expenses than many other countries, allowing it to absorb the impact of the additional US tariffs. Therefore, the assumption that Thai products could replace Chinese goods in the US market might be less feasible,"" said Mr Rak.
""However, if the US increases tariffs again on Chinese imports in the future, Thai exports may have a better opportunity to penetrate the market.""
He said Thailand remains a target for tariff hikes as it recorded a trade surplus of US$40.7 billion with the US in 2023.
To navigate risks this year, Mr Rak advised Thai businesses to focus on exploring new markets to act as a buffer against volatility from reliance on the US and China, the two main players in the ongoing trade war.
Alternative markets include India, which maintains a neutral stance with the US and China, and it has strong economic growth prospects. India also has a halal market, which has significant potential given the global Muslim population of around 2 billion, a quarter of the world's population, he said.
Uncertainty regarding global trade stemming from Trump's policies could lead to volatility in financial markets, increasing risks for exporters due to exchange rate fluctuations.
As a result, financial risk management tools such as forward contracts to hedge against currency fluctuations will remain essential for Thai exporters this year, said Mr Rak.
Businesses should also implement scenario planning to assess potential risks, analyse their impacts, and prepare response strategies proactively rather than reacting after issues arise, he said.
The global trade environment is highly uncertain this year, particularly because of Trump's sudden policy shifts, said Mr Rak. While some countries or industries may benefit from this situation, the overall impact is likely to weaken global trade and add uncertainty to both the global and Thai economic outlook, he said.
Pipat Luengnaruemitchai, chief economist at Kiatnakin Phatra Financial Group, warned Thailand faces higher risk from US trade policies, which could be used as a negotiation tool. This makes Thailand and Southeast Asia potential targets for US trade measures, which could significantly impact the Thai trade sector, he said.
Beyond the potential effects on exports, Thailand may also face pressure to grant greater market access to certain goods, including agricultural products, said Mr Pipat.
On the other hand, Thailand could benefit from multinational companies relocating their production bases. To navigate these challenges and secure the best possible outcomes, the country must be prepared, he said.
""Given Trump's negotiation strategy, the US is expected to begin trade talks with the European region first, followed by China and Asia's major economies,"" said Mr Pipat. ""After that, the US is likely to turn its attention to Southeast Asia, starting with Vietnam and then Thailand, in line with each country's trade surplus with the US.""
These negotiations could increase uncertainty and Thailand must monitor the implementation of US tariff policies. If the US negotiates with China, Asean and Thailand may benefit from production base relocations, he said.
Paradorn Tiaranapramote, first vice-president of Asia Plus Securities' research division, said Thailand contributes only 2% of the US's imports, less than Mexico (19%), China (17%) and Canada (17%), meaning Thailand is unlikely to be among the first targets of US tariffs.
Trump is negotiating with many countries over import tariffs. Most of these talks are with nations or regions that make up more than 10% of US imports, such as Mexico, China, Canada and the euro zone.
He said the Thai government will negotiate with the US to increase imports of US goods such as ethanol and agricultural goods, while improving its military relationship with the US in order to reduce tariff impacts.
Exports to the US make up 13% of China's total shipments, while the US accounts for 17% of Thailand's exports. If the US and China do not impose harsher tariffs or non-tariff measures and negotiate, the impact of the trade war would ease, said Mr Paradorn.
Kasem Prunratanamala, head of research at CGS International Securities (Thailand), said given Thailand's large trade surplus with the US, there should be concerns about potential tariff hikes on Thai exports.
The US Census Bureau ranks Thailand as having a substantial trade surplus with the US, he said.
Exports of electronics and electrical equipment formed more than half of total Thai exports to the US in 2024, and CGS believes these sectors could be hit by higher tariffs, said Mr Kasem.
The US was the largest export market for Thailand in 2024, with the Thai trade surplus with the US surging from $29 billion in 2023 to $35 billion last year. Thailand's trade surplus with the US increased from 5.5% of Thai GDP in 2023 to 6.6% in 2024.
China, Mexico, Vietnam, Ireland and Germany recorded the five largest trade surpluses with the US during the first 11 months of 2024, according to the US bureau.
The five most popular Thai sectors shipped to the US are: electronics; electrical appliances; rubber products; automobiles, auto parts and accessories; and machinery and parts.
Saharat Chudsuwan, managing director of Tisco Asset Management, said Vietnam has a higher trade surplus with the US than Thailand and is considered a proxy of China by some analysts, meaning it is at higher risk of a Trump import tariff.
However, Vietnam's economic growth is projected to be 6-7%, compared with less than 3% in Thailand, meaning Vietnam has a stronger economic buffer than we do, he said.
""We must not forget that during Trump's first term, a trade war existed, but there were no physical wars. Now there are actual wars going on, so all risks are higher for his second term,"" said Mr Saharat.
He said while Trump's policies pose high risks and volatility, his goal is to improve the US economy and domestic employment. As a consequence, countries doing business with the US should realise some benefits, said Mr Saharat.
An analysis by the Trade Policy and Strategy Office found 29 Thai product categories at risk of US tariff measures, including computers and components, mobile phones, precious jewellery and components, electrical machinery and agricultural products.
However, the Center for Economic and Business Forecasting at the University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce (UTCC) identified opportunities for Thailand to expand its market share in the US as China faces potential tariff increases, with machinery, electrical appliances, rubber and rubber goods, toys, games, and sports equipment all offering growth potential.
The US slapped tariffs on Chinese imports shortly after Trump took office, followed by a reciprocal move by Beijing.
Chaichan Charoensuk, chairman of the Thai National Shippers' Council, said the government should urgently set up a Trump 2.0 policy-focused war room and convene a meeting immediately after Commerce Minister Pichai Naripthaphan returns from the US.
He said a unified strategy between the public and private sectors is needed, with clarity on Thailand's position regarding negotiations following the US announcement of measures against Thailand.
Mr Chaichan said the auto parts sector has the potential to increase exports to the US after the announcement of tariffs on Mexico, which were quickly paused for a month. He said negotiations and adjustments to products may be necessary to meet auto parts market demand.
He said certain products require close attention, such as electronic parts, electrical appliances and rubber goods, as importers place orders in advance and they have been ramping up over the last three months, with a noticeable uptick in the volume of electronic parts.
Thanavath Phonvichai, president of the UTCC, said establishing a war room between the government and the private sector is essential because of Trump's background as a businessman, requiring ongoing communication and information exchange.
Mr Thanavath said Trump's actions are unpredictable, such as the recent tariff threats against Colombia, Mexico and Canada that are widely viewed as negotiation tactics. Contrary to Trump's bellicose speeches, a full-scale trade war does not seem imminent, he said.
Regarding the 10% tariff hike on Chinese imports, which is well below the threatened 60% rate, it is unlikely to have a significant effect on China as its products were already affordable, said Mr Thanavath.
While a full-blown trade war seems unlikely in the first half of this year, he said it could emerge later as the US grapples with persistent inflation of 2.9%. This inflation level hampers the Federal Reserve from lowering interest rates, and if prices rise further the Fed might have to raise rates instead, said Mr Thanavath.
Trump's measures appear to be more focused on reinforcing fiscal policies, he said.
Mr Thanavath said the commerce minister's trip to the US for preliminary negotiations could include talks with senior US executives, providing valuable insights into the American perspective on Thailand.
""Thailand is prepared to collaborate with the US to promote a balanced trade relationship. Trump has not mentioned Thailand, so we will have to wait until April to see how things unfold,"" he said.
There are fears Trump's new tariff policy will make it more difficult for the government to control Chinese products flooding the Thai market and affecting local manufacturers, said Kriengkrai Thiennukul, chairman of the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI).
In addition to a hotter trade war, the tariffs have the FTI concerned over the indirect impact on Thai industries.
Chinese companies may opt to export more products to Southeast Asia, including Thailand, which is struggling to deal with the influx of low-cost Chinese goods, said Mr Kriengkrai. Cheap Chinese imports began to flow into the Thai market starting in 2020, then continued annually, causing a negative impact last year, he said.
Up to 23 industries have been affected by the Chinese product influx, with the FTI predicting the number of industries will rise to 30 this year, including steel, textiles and garments, and consumer products.
""If China faces obstacles to exporting to the US, its goods may flood Thailand and other trading partners, heating up price competition,"" said Mr Kriengkrai.
He said he wants strong government measures to regulate Chinese imports and promotion of more Thai products in the domestic market.
The Customs Department already imposed a 7% value-added tax on imports valued at less than 1,500 baht to slow their sales, and the Thai Industrial Standards Institute is conducting more frequent inspections of products listed on online platforms.
The Joint Standing Committee on Commerce, Industry and Banking asked the government to strengthen measures, using the 1999 Anti-Dumping Act and the 2007 Safeguard Measures on Increased Imports Act to better deal with the problem.
In terms of using more locally made products in state projects, Mr Kriengkrai said the ""Houses for Thais"" scheme should have at least 90% of the project's value comprised of Thai products.

We recently published a list of 10 AI News Updates You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI news updates you should not miss.
Europe is putting itself on the artificial map with France and the United Arab Emirates having agreed to a framework accord for a 1 gigawatt data center dedicated to artificial intelligence. The French presidency said in a statement that the center will be the core of a new AI “campus” and will have up to 1 gigawatt of capacity, “which represents investments of 30 to 50 billion euros”.

The move is said to be a part of a larger AI agreement signed between French President Emmanuel Macron and his UAE counterpart Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Paris. President Emmanuel Macron hosted his Emirati counterpart on Thursday.
“The two leaders expressed their desire to create a strategic partnership in the field of AI and committed to exploring collaborations on projects and investments supporting the development of the AI ​​value chain”.
According to the leaders, the investments would go into both French and Emirati AI and would include buying advanced chips, building data centers, talent development, and establishing virtual data embassies to secure AI and cloud systems in both countries.
France is also going to be hosting the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Summit at the Grand Palais on February 10-11, 2025. The country has deemed the summit a “wake-up call” for Europe in the global race for AI.
“The summit comes at exactly the right time for this wake-up call for France and Europe, and to show we are in position” to take advantage of the technology, an official in Macron’s office told reporters.
Attendees at the summit will include Sam Altman, head of OpenAI, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Nobel Prize winner Demis Hassabis, who leads the company’s DeepMind AI research unit, amongst many other industry leaders, government officials, and similar figures from around the world.
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).
Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 193
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services. On February 7, Timothy Arcuri from UBS maintained a “Buy” rating on the stock with a price target of $185.00. Besides UBS, analyst Joseph Moore at Morgan Stanley is also bullish on the stock and calls Nvidia a “top pick”. On February 6th, Moore reiterated an “Overweight” rating on the stock with a $152 price target. He said investors should buy in the DeepSeek dip.
“While sentiment has worsened around potential longer term risks, near term business continues to firm, Blackwell supply visibility continues to build [and] customer desire to spend is clearly on display. We remain very optimistic on how the balance of the year plays out.”
Amongst other things, Moore believes the biggest long-term catalyst for Nvidia goes beyond AI training and into the company’s leadership in the inference market. Inference is a process where trained AI models apply its knowledge to new data and then making predictions or decisions based on that data.
“We remain convinced that Nvidia is the biggest beneficiary of long inference workloads.”
Overall, NVDA ranks 4th on our list of AI news updates you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In 2023, 16,806 Americans aged 60 and older reported falling victim to scams, losing a staggering $1.6 billion. The common thread? Cryptocurrencies. Digital currency scams accounted for over 69,000 complaints and $5.6 billion in losses across all age groups.
Unfortunately, crypto scams are easy to execute due to the complexity of digital currencies and growing interest in new investments. For older adults, losing money to such scams could jeopardize their retirement savings.
Accredited investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger — and benefit from regular distributions without lifting a finger. Here’s how
Car insurance in America now costs a stunning $2,329/year on average — but here’s how 2 minutes can save you more than $600 in 2025
Lock in juicy quarterly income through this $1B private real estate fund — even if you’re not a millionaire. Here’s how to get started with as little as $10
Crypto scams take many forms, but there are ways you can insulate yourself from the thousands that take place every day.
Financial advisors are trained to recognize legitimate investment opportunities and can help you steer clear of suspicious or overly risky ventures, including those involving digital currencies.
WiserAdvisor is a free matching service that helps you find an advisor who can help you reach your financial goals by matching you with a pre-screened financial advisor from their database of thousands.
All it takes is a few minutes to answer some questions about yourself, and WiserAdvisor will provide you with a personalized match of two to three advisors. From there, you can book a free, no-obligation consultation to confirm if your match is right for you.
Outside of professional help, another great defense against scammers is education. An FBI report showed that fraudulent investments (which caused over $3.96 billion in losses among all victims) and phishing or spoofing scams (an estimated $9.6 million in financial loss) were most likely to fool victims in the 60+ age group. Phishing and spoofing schemes trick individuals into sharing personal or financial information, believing they are interacting with legitimate companies. Learning how to spot these scams is critical to protecting your wealth.
Common scams include fake initial coin offerings (ICOs), which entice victims to purchase worthless currencies, and fake digital wallets, where victims unknowingly provide private keys to criminals.

You can avoid cryptocurrency scams entirely by steering clear of this market.
Most older adults and pre-retirees should exercise caution in their investments due to their shorter timelines. Putting money you may need to use soon into such a volatile asset is risky, even if the coin is legitimate.
Instead of risking your investment, consider tried-and-true options like precious metals, real estate, or the stock market, all of which are more accessible than ever and allow for the potential for steady growth over time.
Many investors prize gold as a potential hedge against inflation and a solid store of wealth.
One way to invest in precious metals that also provides significant tax advantages is with a gold IRA from Thor Metals. This retirement account can help stabilize your finances by allowing you to invest directly in physical precious metals rather than stocks and bonds.
Thor Metals offers expert guidance and secure storage of your precious metals assets in partnership with top-tier, IRS-approved depositories. If you want to learn more, you can get Thor Metals' free gold and silver information guide.
Another option for investors looking for an alternative to crypto’s volatility and scam potential is real estate. This tangible, stable asset class has a proven track record of long-term growth. And thanks to new platforms like Arrived, you no longer need to break the bank just to get in.
Backed by world-class investors like Jeff Bezos, Arrived’s easy-to-use platform offers SEC-qualified investments such as rental homes and vacation rentals for as little as $100.
Start by browsing a curated selection of homes, vetted for their appreciation and income potential. Once you find a property you like, simply choose the number of shares you want to buy.
Accredited investors with $50,000 at their disposal can put their capital into larger-scale, necessity-based commercial real estate through First National Realty Partners (FNRP).
FNRP is a private equity real estate investment firm that specializes in acquiring and managing grocery-anchored commercial properties across the U.S. These properties often feature large, well-known retailers like Kroger, Walmart, and Whole Foods, which have the potential to provide steady, reliable income streams.
Investors can research FNRP’s offerings at their convenience, request and execute investment documents and then track and manage the progress of their investments through their personalized investor portal account.
Companies offering in-depth market research or reliable trading platforms will probably go a little further in helping you prioritize stability and informed decision-making over crypto investments.
Moby, founded by former hedge fund analysts, offers an investment research platform that provides expert stock picks, presenting a safer alternative to the unpredictability of cryptocurrency. Their analysts dedicate hours each week to analyzing financial data and trends to deliver top-tier stock reports.
Over four years, Moby's nearly 400 stock recommendations have outperformed the S&P 500 by an impressive 12% on average. With user-friendly formats and a 30-day money-back guarantee, Moby gives you the opportunity to become a wiser investor in just five minutes.

PETALING JAYA: There is no need to panic as the Health Ministry has an adequate supply of flu vaccines in its healthcare facilities, says Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad (pic).
The Health Minister said although the country has run out of certain types of flu vaccine, the new stock is expected to arrive by March.
Speaking to The Star on Sunday (Feb 9), Dzulkefly said this situation was confirmed by the pharmaceutical and healthcare company handling flu vaccines in Malaysia.
""There was a high uptake globally. They informed me that they have run out of stock, but it will be restocked in early March.
""They are, however, planning to switch to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIV) come September this year,"" said Dzulkefly.
(TIV protects against three different Influenza viruses, while Sanofi flu shots protect against influenza A and B strains.)
“The influenza vaccine supply situation in Malaysia highlights some challenges in ensuring the stability of product availability, particularly for quadrivalent vaccines.
“There are four registered influenza vaccine brands, but currently, only two are actively available on the market - namely Vaxigrip Tetra (Sanofi) and Influvac Tetra (Abbott) – which is supplied under the contract with the Health Ministry.
“Fluarix Tetra (GSK) is no longer marketed, and SKYCellflu (Pharmaniaga Marketing, SK Bioscience Korea) has no stock in the country.
“Currently, there is an unexpected surge in demand for influenza vaccines, affecting the supply of the two remaining products.
“Sanofi is working to secure supplies from Thailand and France to meet demand in the private sector, while Abbott, although still having stock, has commitments tied to its contract with the Health Ministry.
“The Pharmacy Services Programme is closely monitoring the vaccine supply in Health Ministry facilities, and the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency is also in communication with the product registration holders to ensure a smooth supply.
“These proactive measures are crucial to ensure that the influenza vaccines meet the current demand, especially in efforts to strengthen public health protection during the flu season,” said Dzulkefly.
The Star reported that Federation of Private Medical Practitioners Associations Malaysia president Dr.Shanmuganathan TV Ganeson had said some vaccines are out of stock.
General practitioners are reported to be seeing a spike in demand following the death of Taiwanese actress Barbie Hsu, from a flu in Japan recently.
""There is currently no stock. None in Sanofi, Zuellig or third-party drug reseller companies.
""The new batch of vaccines, both Fluarix and Vaxigrip, may be available by early March,"" said Dr Shanmuganathan.

We recently published a list of the 12 Best Hair Care Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA) stands against other best hair care stocks to buy right now.
According to a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global hair care industry is valued at $93.89 billion as of 2025. It is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3.4% between 2025 and 2030 and reach $110.97 billion by 2030. The Asia-Pacific region is the largest market for the hair care industry worldwide. However, South America takes the top spot as the fastest growing.
The steady growth in the global hair care industry can be attributed to various factors, including consumers’ evolving preferences and increasing technological advancements. In addition, macro trends such as a growing focus on personal wellness, inclination towards top luxury and premium hair care brands, and growing disposable incomes are further supporting growth in the global hair care industry. The demand for eco-friendly and sustainable solutions is also growing, as consumers are inclined towards organic, natural, and vegan hair care solutions and products.
Another prominent driver of market growth in the global hair care industry is the rising prevalence of hair concerns. These include hair fall, dandruff, heat damage from styling tools, and other conditions. Around 50 million men and 30 million women in the United States were affected by androgenetic alopecia in 2023 alone. Androgenetic alopecia is commonly known as male-pattern baldness in men and female-pattern hair loss in women. The rise of such concerns is ballooning the demand for specialized hair care products. The hair loss treatment segment is thus anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.6% between 2024 and 2029.
Another report by Mordor Intelligence shows similar trends in the hair care products market. It has a size of $94.10 billion as of 2025 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3.39% between 2025 and 2030. This translates to an anticipated market size of around $111.16 billion by 2030. Specialized concerns such as hair and scalp problems are driving this growth. In addition, consumers are inclined towards hair care products recommended by professionals, further driving the market.

American consumers are rightfully skeptical about the future, wondering if President Donald Trump’s tariffs could lead to a trade war. Trump said he would impose 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican goods and 10% on imported goods from China. He also signaled that potential tariffs on items imported from the European Union may be next. According to CNBC, Trump agreed to halt tariffs against Mexico for a month and delay those against Canada for at least 30 days. However, China has already responded with additional tariffs of up to 15% on goods imported from the United States.
American consumers expect these tariffs to directly impact their wallets. A recent consumer survey conducted by BOE on the potential effects of tariffs on consumers found that nearly 86% of Americans believed their wallets would be affected by the scenario. 12% are already stockpiling items, with a majority of others changing their shopping habits to accommodate the effects of these tariffs on their bank accounts.
Economists corroborate this view and say that many businesses will likely pass down the additional expenses to customers, indirectly or directly. This is why tariffs typically trigger increased prices for consumers. Higher tariffs on items traded between the US and China may result in inflated prices on appliances, apparel, electronics, and toys. Similarly, tariffs against Canada and Mexico may increase the already existing pressure on grocery prices.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, grocery prices are up 28% over the last five years. These conditions are materializing when consumer spending is already stretched, with many households feeling financial strain. The US economy has noted steady progress overall in bringing inflation down. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the consumer price index, a significant inflation measure, increased 2.9% in December 2024 compared to a year earlier, down from a June 2022 pandemic-era high of 9.1%. However, most cases show a slowing in price increases instead of a significant fall.
We sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 25 hair care stocks. We then selected the top 12 most popular stocks among elite hedge funds as of Q3 2024. We sourced the hedge fund sentiment data from Insider Monkey’s database. The list is sorted in ascending order of hedge fund sentiment.
Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the consumer price index, a significant inflation measure, increased 2.9% in December 2024 compared to a year earlier, down from a June 2022 pandemic-era high of 9.1%. However, most cases show a slowing in price increases instead of a significant fall.

Nearly 135 years ago, the first electric vehicle drove around the streets of Des Moines, Iowa. It carried an impressive six passengers but could only go 14 miles per hour – we’ve come a long way since then.
In 2024 EVs grew to 8% of all cars sold in the United States and are expected to reach 10% this year – a remarkable acceleration since 2015 when EVs were less than 1% of total sales.
Globally, EV sales jumped 21% in 2024 compared to the year before, while gas car sales slumped again for the seventh straight year.
The U.S. has also emerged as the global leader in international automotive sector investment, particularly EV manufacturing. Since 2021, the U.S. share of global EV investments more than tripled and the U.S. received more private EV manufacturing investments than any other region in the world, reversing China’s years of dominance.
Through September 2024, private companies announced $209 billion in investments in U.S. EV and battery manufacturing, which are expected to create more than 240,000 manufacturing jobs. More than three-quarters of these investments are either under construction or operational as of October 2024.
U.S. policymakers can keep EV sales in the fast lane by sustaining support for the domestic EV market so America’s market and production-base can rival global leaders like China.
The global EV transition continued at a remarkable pace in 2024, setting new records with nearly 17 million EVs sold worldwide (including plug-in hybrids) an increase from 14 million in 2023. EVs also accounted for 21% of all passenger vehicle sales, up from 18% the previous year.
Light passenger vehicles include cars, SUVs, and light pickup trucks. 2024 sales are estimated based ... [+] on data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance data for EVs and S&P Global for total vehicle sales.
Meanwhile, conventional gas-powered car sales have fallen dramatically from a peak of 90 million in 2017 to just 62 million in 2024.
Light passenger vehicles include cars, SUVs, and light pickup trucks. 2024 sales are estimated based ... [+] on data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance data for EVs and S&P Global for total vehicle sales.
China led the increase in global EV sales last year. Its EV market share, including plug-in-hybrids, climbed to 49% for light-duty vehicles. Meanwhile, EVs market share in Europe stood at 21% in 2024 with sales declining slightly from the previous year because Germany and a few other nations repealed consumer incentive repeals.
Several factors support continued EV expansion in the U.S. To start, Cox Automotive expects automakers will introduce 15 new EV models to the American market. In 2024, GM’s launch of lower-cost models propelled its EV sales to 114,000 units, an 50% increase over the year before, driving Investor’s Business Daily to note “EV Sales Surge for Auto Giants Not Named Tesla.” Strong domestic manufacturing growth and expanding charging infrastructure also increase the prospects for U.S. EV sales.
Automobile manufacturing and sales are two of the largest segments of the U.S. and global economies, and the International Energy Administration forecasts EV sales will hit 50% of all cars sold globally by 2035, making EVs the undeniable future of transportation. Falling behind in EV adoption risks forfeiting access to international markets and economic opportunities for years to come. The international competition is fierce, and retreating from next-generation vehicle leadership would have profound economic consequences.
When factoring in fuel and maintenance savings, EVs already cost less in many situations, and EVs are cheaper to charge than filling up a gas-powered car everywhere across the U.S. Within a few years, EVs are expected to become the more affordable option across the board.
Today, the standard EV sticker price is $7,000 more than an average gas-powered car without incentives. For now, federal and state policies play a vital role bridging this gap, but the need for consumer incentives is time-limited, not an open-ended commitment. Within a few years, EVs will have a distinct upfront cost advantage, creating self-propelling momentum.
Maintaining EV purchase incentives ensures consumers can access this inflation-fighting technology while manufacturers scale production and achieve economies of scale. Rolling back incentives, pollution standards, or other supportive measures would threaten consumer savings and compromise America’s economic competition in global markets.
Battery-electric vehicles overwhelmingly dominate the next generation light-duty vehicle segment, which includes cars, SUVs, and small trucks. In the U.S., just 332 hydrogen-fueled light-duty vehicles were sold in the first half of 2024, down 82% from the year before.
BEVs are also the preferred choice for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. Globally, BEVs outsell hydrogen vehicles by a ratio of 10-to-1 in these larger vehicle categories. In 2024, the U.S. market alone offered 187 different battery-electric medium- and heavy-duty trucks compared to just 20 hydrogen-fueled models.
BEVs also have a substantial lead in charging infrastructure, further strengthening their practicality and market position. By 2024, the U.S. had only 54 publicly accessible hydrogen fueling stations, compared to 20,000 charging locations for light-duty vehicles and 11,600 for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. This disparity makes BEVs far more accessible and scalable for both consumers and fleet operators.
In addition to infrastructure dominance, EVs offer inherent advantages in efficiency and performance compared to hydrogen-powered alternatives. Battery range, charging speed, and energy density improvements continue to make EVs increasingly competitive across all use cases.
EVs are on a clear trajectory to becoming the world’s most affordable transportation option, but strategic policies are essential to America remaining competitive in the next-generation motor vehicle market. This includes technology-neutral incentives for consumers and businesses, loan support, targeted investments in domestic supply chains and charging infrastructure, and vehicle pollution standards.

The Trump administration says it will repeal consumer EV incentives, but this risks stalling America’s vehicle electrification progress. While EVs already save consumers money through lower fuel and maintenance costs, most car buyers focus on upfront purchase price rather than long-term affordability. Until manufacturing scales further and sticker prices decline, consumer incentives remain a crucial bridge to a fully competitive EV market.
Fortunately, supporting America’s EV industry has bipartisan support. Ohio Senator Bernie Moreno, who owns a network of car dealerships, has indicated “he is open to a gradual phaseout of the EV tax credit — a nod to dealers’ and automakers’ concerns.” That’s a step in the right direction.
Strategic EV policies also align directly with many of the new administration’s energy priorities: strengthening domestic manufacturing, lowering costs for American consumers, and enhancing energy security. Hundreds of billions of dollars in investments committed and quality jobs being created nationwide—especially in states like Georgia, Michigan, and South Carolina—create significant economic and political momentum for these efforts.
Timely and decisive interventions can cement the foundation for a cheaper, more secure, and cleaner American transportation system. A well-crafted policy framework will strengthen domestic markets while building resilient supply chains through American innovation. This is an economic and strategic imperative—an opportunity to ensure U.S. leadership in a global industry poised to define the 21st century.

We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 11 Stocks & President Trump. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.
Jim Cramer’s latest appearance on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street saw him continue to comment on the semiconductor industry. While chip stocks, primarily those geared towards data center AI computing, were the biggest winners of the AI revolution, things took a sharp turn last month following the DeepSeek selloff. Now, investors are continuously wondering whether the billions of dollars earmarked for data centers will actually materialize.
However, while the selloff occurred in 2025, Cramer’s co-host Carl Quintanilla pointed out that chip stocks were range bound since the latter half of 2024. In response, Cramer shared that investing in these stocks had “been very very difficult, because frankly, they’re one of the segments that you don’t want to be in.” This is because he believes that “There seems like there’s too much competition” amongst the companies. This includes the firm responsible for the Snapdragon processors “going against” the British design house owned by Softbank. Other examples shared by Cramer include the design house going against Dr. Lisa Su’s chip company and America’s largest and only integrated chip maker simply “flailing,” with Wall Street’s favorite AI GPU stock lately coming “under attack.”
This turmoil leads the CNBC host to conclude that “you’ve got a group David, that is frankly verklempt is the word I was searching for.”
Cramer also commented on research papers and industry participants pointing at the continually dropping AI training costs. Commenting specifically on a Stanford paper saying researchers training a cloud model for 5o bucks, he sardonically remarked “I think by the end these guys are going to make it so that, they pay you to take it. I mean there’s a little absurdity going on here.”
Another topic he discussed in quite detail during the show was the auto industry. Elon Musk’s car company and the firm that makes the F-150 truck fell as trading opened on the back of factors such as weaker demand in Europe and auto demand in America. Cramer believes that the latter firm’s CEO “Jim Farley is a great spokesman for the auto industry. He just said look, it’s a disaster what it is. Obviously, it’s going to hurt them.” Discussing President Trump’s sanctions against Mexico, Cramer pointed out that they would be particularly painful for Farley’s company due to its Mexican production base. Cramer added that a new direction in the tariff debate might see the President take aim on Japan and South Korea.
According to him:
“He [Farley] did. . .at one point say and I thought it was very important for the American people, said, we are having this conversation, well Honda is importing six hundred thousand units in the US with no incremental tariff. Why is Toyota able to import point five million vehicles in the US with no incremental tariff? I mean there are millions of vehicles coming into this country that are not being applied. Now I think that’s what I would go to the President and say.”
Cramer also shared his take on Mexican President Claudia Scheinbaum. “Claudia Scheinbaum’s ratings, I was looking at hers yesterday, the President of Mexico,” he shared. “Through the roof, in the eighties. Because they feel that she offered a credible solution, which is to sit down and talk with the President,” he added.
To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired on February 6th.
For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).

Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) is a luxury apparel company whose shares gained more than 79% in 2024. The stock soared amidst troubles in the broader retail industry as the firm’s wealthy customers bucked inflationary trends. Cramer’s previous comments about the firm have commented on the market cheering former FTC head Lina Khan blocking Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR)’s Capri acquisition. His latest remarks surrounded a broader recovery in the apparel sector:
“Peloton is rather amazing. But apparel Tapestry, that surprised me. That’s Coach. So there are some, I’ve been seeing some life in that group which I hadn’t because they’re so often connected with department stores. But Ralph Lauren’s really cleaned up the outlets.”
Overall, TPR ranks 4th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of TPR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than TPR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

    After a week of using DeepSeek's R1 reasoning model, I'm highly impressed, even if some questions are off-limits.
  
If you ever wondered what it would look like to see someone's stream of consciousness in real time, DeepSeek R1 might be the closest you'll get. 
When DeepSeek R1 landed on the internet in late January, it caught the AI industry off guard. Suddenly, there was a freely available and open-source ""reasoning"" AI model that could rival the equivalent $200 per month offering from OpenAI, creator of ChatGPT. Almost immediately, tech stocks plummeted. Investors wondered why they were throwing billions of dollars at OpenAI, Google and Microsoft when a scrappy team out of China was seemingly able to do just as much with significantly fewer resources. Nvidia, the company making the chips powering AI development, saw the single largest market value drop in US history, losing more than $600 billion in a day. 
Reasoning AI models can handle more-complex questions and do so by breaking problems down step-by-step, whereas the free version of ChatGPT tries to predict the next best word in a sentence.
Essentially, DeepSeek R1 commodified reasoning-level AI models overnight — imagine Toyota suddenly producing Ferrari-level engines en masse. 
I spoke with AI experts, and the most interesting or amusing characteristic of DeepSeek R1 is being able to see its chain of thought. If you ask DeepSeek to tell you a bedtime story about a tenacious kitten, say, you're able to see all the considerations it's making while it's processing your request. Basically, you can see DeepSeek think. And it's fascinating.
DeepSeek will literally sometimes say, ""hmm,"" which is both quirky and bewildering. OpenAI doesn't let users see ChatGPT's train of thought, so that it doesn't give away its secrets (though now it's showing small snippets). DeepSeek R1 is also open source, meaning any company can use its AI model, which is a major threat to OpenAI.
An example of DeepSeek R1's train of thought.
I've been using DeepSeek on desktop for the past week. For security reasons, I opted not to install the app on my phone. Experts advise against installing the app on your personal device, given DeepSeek's Chinese roots and the extensive data collection mentioned in its terms of service. (It would've been nice if word about that had gotten out before the DeepSeek app shot to the top of the App Store.) 
While using DeepSeek, I've been asking more-general and abstract questions, not uploading any sensitive data, or asking questions that could put me, or CNET, in a compromising position. 
Journalism is largely a job of synthesizing information from multiple sources and distilling it for a lay audience. In the past this required me to go to Google Scholar, skim through research papers and email professors to ultimately collect relevant quotes to include in an article. AI has changed that process significantly. Now I can ask an AI model specific research questions and it can scrub the internet and give me an answer, usually with sourcing. I continue to interview professors, of course, and I do have to go back and double-check the information the AI serves up, because AI bots can sometimes hallucinate and present something false as correct. Despite that, using AI is often still faster than if I had to tackle research papers manually. 
For a feature story I'm working on, I asked DeepSeek to help me find information about TikTok's moderation policies and how they've been applied both correctly and incorrectly in the past. I also asked it to help me consider some unforeseen circumstances of overly strong social media moderation policies. This type of search isn't entirely novel — older versions of ChatGPT could also handle these sorts of queries. But I was impressed by DeepSeek's overall accuracy and synthesis of multiple articles. Where ChatGPT-4o felt like a really advanced version of autocomplete, DeepSeek R1 actually seems to be parsing through information and coming to conclusions. 
It's not that ChatGPT-4o's responses are majorly worse. But reasoning models like DeepSeek R1 are much better in terms of quality and more-extensive text output, sourcing and nuance. It really does feel like DeepSeek is ""thinking"" more.
That's not to say DeepSeek is perfect. Given its Chinese roots, some questions are off-limits. A commonly cited example in the media are queries regarding the 1989 massacre in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. You can see DeepSeek trying to begin answering before it cancels out and tells you to ask something else. I tried asking it, very broadly, to give me background information about the Uyghur minority in China over the last few years. I saw it generating paragraphs of thought before totally canceling itself out. But if I asked about issues in America or other parts of the world, DeepSeek had little problem returning results. 
Example of DeekSeek R1's train of thought on China's past human rights abuses.
An example of DeepSeek R1 cancelling out a response the Chinese government wouldn't like.
The release of AI chatbots, starting with OpenAI's ChatGPT in late 2022, is changing how humans gather information online. Instead of you having to read multiple articles and synthesize information in your head, AI can do the connection-making for you. Reasoning AIs are an evolution of that. Using one feels much closer to having an expert inside your house. In the past, if I found myself stuck on a problem, I'd ask my friends or post a thread on Reddit for answers. This is obviously still an option, but it requires me having to bother others and hope they respond. 
DeepSeek R1 and ChatGPT o1 essentially relieve me of that social anxiety. Plus, it takes seconds to get an answer, versus whatever the other person's schedule allows for. Knowing if the output is correct, however, is another problem entirely. "

Mobile gaming has reached a point where smartphones can handle graphically demanding, console-quality games, yet touchscreen controls continue to be a weak link. The lack of precision forces players to deal with frustrating input delays, limiting the experience. While many controllers attempt to fix this, most introduce bulky designs, awkward mounting systems, and storage challenges that diminish the convenience of gaming on the go.
The OhSnap MCON, introduced at CES 2025, changes the equation. Designed to be the most compact and portable mobile controller ever, it magnetically attaches to the back of a phone and stays out of the way until needed.
Designer: Josh King & Dave Echem
Click Here to Buy Now: $119 $149 (20% off). Hurry, only 4/2855 left! Raised over $1.5 million. Less than 72-hours to go.

Most mobile controllers need to be detached and stored when not in use, making them impractical for everyday carry. The MCON solves this by magnetically snapping to the back of a phone, ensuring it’s always within reach. Measuring just 5.67 inches long and under three-quarters of an inch thick, it maintains a low profile without compromising functionality.

“OhSnap MCON eliminates the bulk and hassle of traditional controllers, making it a must-have for every mobile gamer,” said OhSnap CEO Dale Backus. Unlike conventional designs that require clamping mechanisms or wired connections, the MCON stays attached at all times, turning a smartphone into a handheld gaming device without extra baggage.
Rather than relying on cumbersome clamps or expandable frames, the MCON features foldable grips that lock into place for comfort, along with a quick-sliding mechanism for instant access. Press both Quick Launch Buttons, and the controller deploys automatically, shifting the phone into an angled position while extending ergonomic grips that lock into place. This seamless transition allows players to go from checking messages to full gameplay in seconds. When a text or call interrupts gameplay, the controller slides shut, instantly returning the phone to its original form without the hassle of detaching or reconnecting anything.

Despite its compact design, the MCON delivers console-quality precision. Many mobile controllers rely on standard analog sticks that are prone to drift, but the MCON features full-sized Hall Effect joysticks. These use magnetic sensors instead of physical contacts, eliminating drift and ensuring long-lasting durability with consistent responsiveness over time.

The button layout is designed for intuitive control. Unlike traditional mechanical switches that produce loud, clicky sounds, the MCON’s silent tactile buttons allow for smooth, discreet gameplay. Whether gaming in a shared space, on a late-night flight, or during a break at work, these buttons provide instant feedback without drawing attention.
Bumper-style triggers further enhance responsiveness, making them ideal for fast-paced games that require split-second inputs. Every design decision in the MCON is centered around a fluid gaming experience without unnecessary bulk.

The MCON works with nearly any modern smartphone, regardless of brand or model. iPhone users benefit from native MagSafe compatibility, allowing the controller to attach magnetically without additional hardware.
For Android users and older iPhones, OhSnap includes a Magnetic Adapter Puck, a thin adhesive-backed disc that replicates the MagSafe attachment system. This ensures seamless integration without the need for clamps, brackets, or extra accessories.
With smartphones varying in size and shape, the MCON’s modular spacer system accounts for different camera bump heights. If a phone has a large camera module, stacking two pucks creates a level attachment. Smaller devices may only need a single puck or none at all, ensuring a stable fit.
Support for foldable phones is also in development, with OhSnap confirming that future updates will introduce mounting solutions for devices like the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip and Motorola Razr.

To keep things simple, the MCON connects wirelessly via Bluetooth, allowing for unrestricted movement without cable clutter. Unlike controllers that require a direct USB-C or Lightning connection, MCON’s wireless setup works across all major mobile platforms.
Despite being Bluetooth-powered, battery life is not a concern—a 30-minute charge lasts for weeks, making it one of the most efficient controllers available.

Most controllers are built as sealed units, making repairs impossible. OhSnap designed the MCON with longevity in mind, using high-grade materials to ensure durability while allowing users to maintain and modify their controllers as needed. The entire device can be disassembled with a Torx screwdriver, enabling joystick replacements, button swaps, and even aesthetic upgrades.
Customization is just as important as repairability. The MCON supports interchangeable top plates, adjustable grips, and modular joystick options, allowing players to tailor it to their preferences. This design approach extends the controller’s lifespan while reducing electronic waste, aligning with the growing Right to Repair movement.

What started as a basement project by 19-year-old Josh King evolved into a breakthrough in mobile gaming. King developed the first prototype using a 3D printer in his parents’ basement, determined to create a controller that made sense for smartphones.
After partnering with OhSnap CEO Dale Backus, the MCON evolved into a refined, market-ready product. The response was overwhelming—within just eight days, its Kickstarter campaign raised over $1 million, proving that gamers are eager for a controller that blends function and form.

The OhSnap MCON redefines mobile gaming with Hall Effect joysticks, silent tactile buttons, and an innovative sliding design. It delivers console-level precision in a form factor built for portability. Its MagSafe attachment, instant deployment, and repairable design ensure seamless integration into any gaming setup.
Jump into an online match or explore an open world—MCON keeps your smartphone ready to play. OhSnap best sums it up: “Play Now.”

Those following along with Foresight Group Holdings Limited (LON:FSG) will no doubt be intrigued by the recent purchase of shares by Bernard Fairman, Co-Founder & Executive Chairman of the company, who spent a stonking UK£1.6m on stock at an average price of UK£4.00. While that only increased their holding size by 1.2%, it is still a big swing by our standards.
 Check out our latest analysis for Foresight Group Holdings 
In fact, the recent purchase by Bernard Fairman was the biggest purchase of Foresight Group Holdings shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. That means that even when the share price was higher than UK£3.71 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.
While Foresight Group Holdings insiders bought shares during the last year, they didn't sell. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!
There are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. If investing in lesser known companies is your style, you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).
For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Foresight Group Holdings insiders own about UK£145m worth of shares (which is 34% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.
It's certainly positive to see the recent insider purchases. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Foresight Group Holdings insiders are well aligned, and quite possibly think the share price is too low. Nice! While it's good to be aware of what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. While conducting our analysis, we found that Foresight Group Holdings has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore this.
Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.
For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.

In order to get people back in the habit of going to movie theaters, the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO, no kidding) has several promotions planned for 2025. The first was Bring Your Own Bucket Day, meaning popcorn bucket. You could fill your own container with popcorn for just $5, as long as the container would fit through the theater door and would not block anyone from seeing the movie. It was a win-win promotion, since you could fill a bathtub with movie popcorn and that $5 would still be almost all profit. People showed up with an outrageous range of containers. Several people came into Cinemark theaters with stock pots or actual five-gallon buckets. A backpack or a pair of jeans will hold a lot of popcorn, but do you really want to eat out of them? One guy wheeled in a piece of furniture- a nightstand, to hold a movie's worth of popcorn. Read about Bring Your Own Bucket Day and see the clever containers people brought in at Foodbeast.

Institutions' substantial holdings in Ceres Power Holdings implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price
The top 8 shareholders own 52% of the company
 Insiders have been buying lately 
To get a sense of who is truly in control of Ceres Power Holdings plc (LON:CWR), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 46% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).
Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.
Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Ceres Power Holdings.
 View our latest analysis for Ceres Power Holdings 
Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.
We can see that Ceres Power Holdings does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Ceres Power Holdings, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.
We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Ceres Power Holdings. Weichai Power Co., Ltd. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 20% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 17% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 3.0% by the third-largest shareholder.
On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 8 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.
While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.
The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.
I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.
Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Ceres Power Holdings plc in their own names. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. It has a market capitalization of just UK£281m, and the board has only UK£923k worth of shares in their own names. Many investors in smaller companies prefer to see the board more heavily invested. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. 
The general public-- including retail investors -- own 16% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.
We can see that Private Companies own 18%, of the shares on issue. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.
It appears to us that public companies own 20% of Ceres Power Holdings. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.
While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that  Ceres Power Holdings is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...

We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Dominating Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR) stands against other AI stocks dominating Wall Street.
Representatives from around the world are going to be attending the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Summit at the Grand Palais on 10–11 February 2025. The summit will focus on harnessing the power of AI systems as well as the risks posed by them. From heads of state and government and leaders of international organizations to business leaders, as well as representatives from academia, civil society, and the arts, it would seem everyone related to the artificial intelligence world is to attend. However, that’s not quite true.

Reuters has recently reported that the U.S. delegation to the AI Summit will not include technical staff from the country’s AI Safety Institute. Vice President JD Vance is leading the U.S. contingent to France, with attendees including members of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy: Principal Deputy Director Lynne Parker and Senior Policy Advisor for Artificial Intelligence Sriram Krishnan. However, Homeland Security and Commerce Department officials are not going to be there, particularly the representatives of the U.S. AI Safety Institute trips have been canceled.
The AI Safety Institute, created under former President Joe Biden, was created to mitigate certain risks from AI, having signed agreements with U.S. startups OpenAI and Anthropic for safety testing. The absence of these representatives implies that the Commerce Department, in which the Safety Institute resides, is still in the transition phase after Trump’s inauguration.
Regarding the discussion on AI, Prof Gina Neff from the Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy said that there is currently “a vacuum for global leadership on AI”.
Another professor from Southampton University seems to agree:
“DeepSeek made everybody realize that China is a force to be reckoned with,” says the computer scientist. We don’t have to just go along with what the big companies on the West Coast are saying. We need global dialogue.”
For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), offers AI-powered enterprise analytics software and services. It is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin and the world’s first Bitcoin Treasury Company. On February 6th, Mark Palmer from Benchmark Co. reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $650.00. Palmer’s buy rating stems from Strategy’s strategic focus and financial performance. The company has recently rebranded its name to “Strategy”, implying an increased focus on Bitcoin and artificial intelligence as the two main transformative technologies of the industry. The firm noted that the rebranding particularly reflects a commitment to aggressively acquiring Bitcoin, noted by the increased BTC Yield target for 2025. The introduction of new key performance indicators, namely BTC Gain and BTC $ Gain, reflects the value generated from MicroStrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR)’s bitcoin treasury operations. Even though there is a projected decrease in the BTC $ Gain target for 2025 compared to 2024, Strategy’s focus on bitcoin acquisition remains intact.
Overall, MSTR ranks 8th on our list of AI stocks dominating Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of MSTR as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSTR but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The S&P 500 is up 69% since bottoming in 2022, but the stocks of some industry-leading companies are still trading in the bargain bin.

The S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has performed remarkably well in recent years, soaring by around 23% in 2024 alone and by more than 80% over the past five years.
