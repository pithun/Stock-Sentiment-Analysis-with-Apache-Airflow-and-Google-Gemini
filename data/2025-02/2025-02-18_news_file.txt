Hereâs a peek of how it works pic.twitter.com/OWG8HFGYYD

Protector lets the user book armed guards on demand. Right now itâs only available in NYC and LA. According to its marketing, every guard is either âactive duty or retired law enforcement and military.â Every booking comes with a motorcade and users get to select the number of Escalades thatâll be joining them as well as the uniforms their hired goons will wear.
Protector is currently â#7 in Travelâ on Appleâs App Store. Itâs not available for people who use Android devices. Sorry Google phone fans, if you want your own armed goons youâll have to resort to more traditional methods of goon employment.
The marketing for Protector, which lives on its X account, is surreal. A series of robust and barrel-chested men in ill-fitting black suits deliver their credentials to the camera while sitting in front of a black background. Theyâre all operators. They describe careers in SWAT teams and being deployed to war zones. They show vanity shots of themselves kitted out in operator gear. All of them have a red lapel pin bearing the symbol of Protector.

Who is this for, you might ask? A video posted on January 6, 2025, that runs just over two minutes gives the game away. It opens with a photo of assassinated UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. âWeâre going to run through a scenario to demonstrate, where if a Protector had been present, crisis could have been averted,â the Protector says in the video. He then runs through several fantasy versions of the assassination where a Protector is on hand to prevent the assassin from killing the CEO.

— Protector (@bookprotectors) January 6, 2025

In the first scenario, the self-described âoperatorâ stops the would-be assassin from getting close enough to do any damage. He turns the shooter away and nothing happens. In the second scenario, the Protector shoots the assassin in the stomach as he draws his weapon. In the third, the assassin gets a shot off but the Protector is able to shoot the assassin in the chest. Then he rolls him over on the wound and ties his hand behind his back.
Protector is something of a pivot for its parent company Protector Security Solutions. The whole thing is the brainchild of founder Nick Sarath, who worked as a product designer at Meta for a year before founding his own company in 2020. That was Poparazzi, an Instagram competitor that burned bright and then died.
He founded Protector Security Solutions in October 2024 and started putting together two apps: Protector and Patrol. Patrol is marketed in the same way and with the same people. Scared suburban neighbors pool their resources to hire private security for their neighborhood. Add more money to unlock more tiers, more cars, more drones, and more guards.

Two days after Thompson was gunned down on the streets of Manhattan, Sarath put out a press release that promised to rush Protector to market. âMy deepest condolences are with the family and friends of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson,â Sarath said in the release. âWe rely on law enforcement to keep us safe, but they cannot be everywhere at once. Protector is designed to support the goals of law enforcement and will provide an accessible way for people to protect themselves and their loved ones.â
âOur trained and highly experienced team is ready to help provide enhanced security to all citizens as soon as we launch,â he continued. âWe are here to help law enforcement and ultimately we are here to help you.â

Attention, Samsung fans: Mint Mobile is finally selling the Galaxy S25 series, and once again, the deals on display are no joke. You can now buy any of the three phones included in the flagship series and score $200 off alongside a year of the Unlimited plan for the discounted price of $15 per month. 
In other words, this Mint Mobile promotion could get you a great 2025 smartphone and a full 12 months of T-Mobile-powered coverage for as little as $780, or $65 per month if you pay using affirm. Considering that most of the best Galaxy S25 deals on the web are trade-in opportunities or gift card incentives, this Mint Mobile offer stands apart as something quite special. Plus, just imagine not paying your phone bill again until March 2026. Yeah, it's that good. 
Samsung Galaxy S25 128GB: $800 $600, plus 12 months of Unlimited for $15/month at Mint Mobile
Purchase the new Samsung Galaxy S25 alongside a year of the Unlimited plan at Mint Mobile and you'll get a straight $200 carved off the phone, plus the price of wireless will drop to only $180 ($15 per month). Both the Galaxy S25 Plus and S25 Ultra are getting the same deal as the base model S25, so you can choose the version that's right for you. 
✅Recommended if: you want the latest Samsung phone at the best price possible without a trade-in; you'd like to save money on your phone bill in 2025. 
❌Skip this deal if: you don't want to commit to one wireless carrier for a full year; you're looking for a trade-in opportunity. 
This deal also comes in the wake of Mint Mobile's confirmation that it will soon be removing the data cap from its Unlimited plan. Although the Unlimited tier already ranked among the best unlimited plans in the business, the 40GB cap meant that heavy data users couldn't get the most out of their Mint Mobile service. Thanks to this update, however, the plan will soon get you truly unlimited talk, text, and data on T-Mobile's vast 5G network, along with a free mobile hotspot, free calls to Mexico and Canada, and Wi-Fi calling support. 
The phones you're getting out of the deal are no slouch, either. All three devices in the Galaxy S25 lineup are powered by the custom Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, plus you get a suite of new Galaxy AI software features, a sophisticated Gorilla Glass Victus 2 construction, and seven years of OS/security updates guaranteed.

A flip-disc display is used to provide the ""pixels."" 
 
Motion trackers concealed within the frame read the user's motions, allowing them to play the games using gestures.

For me it's a bridge too far, but in creating these pieces, Breakfast is trying to make a statement about how videogames have gone from humble curiosities to generating billions of dollars in revenue. To that end, these pieces are apparently connected to the internet and track the stock market in real time; when the market goes up, the difficulty level of the games is increased. ""The higher the value, the faster and more challenging the gameplay,"" the firm explains.
 
These are being released as limited edition art pieces, with just 8 units made for each of the three games.

3,2025-02-18,"We are in quite an era of smartphones, aren’t we? We’ve got overseas manufacturing giants claiming to make the thinnest folding phone on the planet, and brands like Motorola are getting Paris Hilton onboard to help market its foldable. Then there’s Samsung, the smartphone giant that arguably made foldables cool again is considering dialing down the price of its Z Flip foldable to make this burgeoning device category more accessible.
How much more accessible? I don’t know yet; it’s just a rumor. The Android blogs have picked up a random Turkish firmware listing from Twitter/X. It’s a screenshot of what is likely a Samsung folding device that will eventually hit the European market. The model number in reference is “SM-F761B,” which follows suit in the current numbering scheme, leading some sleuths to believe that it isn’t the Galaxy Z Flip 7 referenced here, but a Galaxy Z Flip FE, or Fan Edition, as Samsung is wont to do.
Samsung’s “fan edition” models are typically dialed-down versions of one of its most popular selling models. There hasn’t been a folding smartphone yet, which seems like a lost opportunity as more brands launch folding devices to compete against Samsung’s existing kin. Motorola hit a lower price point with the Razr last year, which started at $700. It had concessions, sure, like subpar camera performance, but it made a flip-phone smartphone possible for users in that bracket.
The rumor of a cheaper Samsung flip phone has percolated since last year, so we’re willing to roll with this super slim rumor that is still only making the rounds among niche nerds like us. Ross Young, our favorite display analyst who always spills the manufacturing tea, says the Z Flip FE will use the Galaxy Z Flip 6‘s 6.7-inch display panel. It’s one way it can cut down the cost.
When would Samsung launch something like a cost-efficient fan edition foldable? I would bet on later this year, right before the big refresh of the folding flagships. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 7 are expected to debut this summer in the Northern Hemisphere. If it’s anything like the last couple of years, an event in New York City will precede it.

          The Samsung Galaxy S25 may look like an iPhone, but its AI assistant reminds me how the world is being separated into AI haves and have-nots.
        

          Another phone ended up being the ""one more thing"" at Galaxy Unpacked, but we know nothing about it other than it's thin.

Florida may be the Sunshine State, but Palm Beach is having a moment in the spotlight. Some brokers say President Donald Trump could be the reason.

        Take 1980 South Ocean Boulevard, a 2-acre vacant lot five minutes from the Trump-owned Mar-a-Lago on Palm Beach's ""Billionaire's Row.""
    

        Its owner — a lawyer and real estate investor named Nathan Royce Silverstein with ties to New Jersey — tried to sell it before, asking $150 million in 2022. This week, he relisted it for $200 million.
    

        Sure, there are renderings for a 20,000-square-foot-plus residence that are ready to show Palm Beach's Architectural Review Commission, and the two-parcel lot has frontage on both the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway.
    

        Still, a key difference between 2022 and 2025 is that now Trump is president.
    

        Agents — including Margit Brandt, who represented the buyer in Palm Beach's most expensive sale of 2024, a man-made island that traded hands for $150 million — call it a ""Trump bump.""
    

        ""In the postelection era, like, Q1 of 2025, we're seeing a lot of these high-priced listings, but at the same time, a lot of action in the market,"" Brandt, Premier Estate Properties, told Business Insider. ""These are not like hypothetical asking prices. We're seeing a lot of actual movement within the high end here.""
    

        ""Palm Beach is a small island with big people,"" she added.
    

        According to Douglas Elliman, the number of signed contracts for homes from $5 million to $9.99 million increased 157% — or from seven homes to 18 — from January 2024 to January 2025. And sales for homes $10 million or more increased by an even larger margin: Three homes were sold in January 2024, while 13 were sold the same month in 2025.
    

        We're tracking the Palm Beach real estate boom as it happens. Below are some key properties and deals.

Tesla is amping up its recruitment efforts in India just days after the country's prime minister, Narendra Modi, met with Elon Musk.

        Tesla listed 13 roles based in Mumbai on its careers page. The positions were also advertised on the company's LinkedIn page on Monday.
    

        The roles range across three categories — vehicle service, sales and customer support, and operations and business support.
    

        All the listings show that the jobs, which are a mix of full time and part time roles, are based out of suburban Mumbai.
    

        The listings also hinted at the opening of a Tesla store and a delivery center in India. For instance, the ""Store Manager"" listing says the new hire will be ""responsible for overseeing and driving sales and sales operations.""
    

        Tesla is also hiring people for delivery operations work. Staff under this designation are expected to ""oversee and coordinate administrative responsibilities at the delivery center.""
    

        Musk met with Modi in Washington on Thursday. The Indian premier also met with President Donald Trump during his two-day visit to the US.
    

        It is unclear if Modi and Musk discussed Tesla's entry into the Indian market during their meeting. Modi wrote in an X post on Thursday that he had a ""very good meeting"" with the Tesla CEO.
    

        ""We discussed various issues, including those he is passionate about such as space, mobility, technology and innovation,"" Modi added.
    

        Trump told reporters on Thursday that while he wasn't sure why Musk had met Modi, he assumed it was because Musk ""wants to do business in India.""
    

        Representatives for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
    

        Tesla has been planning to enter the Indian market for close to a decade. In April 2016, the company started accepting pre-orders for its vehicles.
    

        Then, in January 2021, Tesla registered a company in India, just weeks after the country's transport minister, Nitin Gadkari, said Tesla would launch its operations there in early 2021. India is the world's third-largest auto market.
    

        But those plans were put on hold. Musk said in July 2021 it was difficult for Tesla to break into the Indian market because the country's ""import duties are the highest in the world by far of any large country.""
    

        ""Still working through a lot of challenges with the government,"" Musk wrote in an X post in January 2022 when asked if Tesla was still planning to launch in India.
    

        In March, India lowered its import taxes on EVs made by companies that commit to invest at least $500 million and start making cars in the country within three years.
    

        Musk was scheduled to visit India in April and announce Tesla's entry into the country. However, the trip was postponed at the last minute.
    

        ""Unfortunately, very heavy Tesla obligations require that the visit to India be delayed, but I do very much look forward to visiting later this year,"" Musk wrote in an X post in April.

The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) reported the housing market index (HMI) was at 42, down from 47 last month.  Any number below 50 indicates that more builders view sales conditions as poor than good.

From the NAHB: Builder Confidence Falls on Tariff and Housing Cost Concerns
Builder sentiment fell sharply in February over concerns on tariffs, elevated mortgage rates and high housing costs.

Builder confidence in the market for newly built single-family homes was 42 in February, down five points from January and the lowest level in five months, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index (HMI) released today.

“While builders hold out hope for pro-development policies, particularly for regulatory reform, policy uncertainty and cost factors created a reset for 2025 expectations in the most recent HMI,” said NAHB Chairman Carl Harris, a custom home builder from Wichita, Kan. “Uncertainty on the tariff front helped push builders’ expectations for future sales volume down to the lowest level since December 2023. Incentive use may also be weakening as a sales strategy as elevated interest rates reduce the pool of eligible home buyers.”

“With 32% of appliances and 30% of softwood lumber coming from international trade, uncertainty over the scale and scope of tariffs has builders further concerned about costs,” said NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. “Reflecting this outlook, builder responses collected prior to a pause for the proposed tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico yielded a lower HMI reading of 38, while those collected after the announced one-month pause produced a score of 44. Addressing the elevated pace of shelter inflation requires bending the housing cost curve to enable adding more attainable housing.

The latest HMI survey also revealed that 26% of builders cut home prices in February, down from 30% in January and the lowest share since May 2024. Meanwhile, the average price reduction was 5% in February, the same rate as the previous month. The use of sales incentives was 59% in February, down from 61% in January. 
...
All three of the major HMI indices posted losses in February. The HMI index gauging current sales conditions fell four points to 46, the component measuring sales expectations in the next six months plunged 13 points to 46, and the gauge charting traffic of prospective buyers posted a three-point decline to 29.

Looking at the three-month moving averages for regional HMI scores, the Northeast fell three points in February to 57, the Midwest moved two points lower to 45, the West edged one-point lower to 39 and the South held steady at 46.

A recent memo underscores the new direction at the FTC, which has previously taken on bias in AI.
by  Lauren Feiner
Newly appointed Federal Trade Commission Chair Andrew Ferguson praised his former boss, the conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, as “the most important judge of the last 100 years,” in a memo to agency staff honoring Black History Month. The message, obtained by The Verge and confirmed by the FTC, sheds light on how Ferguson may align himself with Thomas — one of the court’s foremost critics of tech’s legal liability shield Section 230 and a skeptic of diversity measures — especially as the FTC chair is tasked with taking on consumer protection cases, which in the past have included considering the role of racial bias in technology.
In the February 7th email, Ferguson took the opportunity to share his thoughts on Thomas, whom he clerked for and calls a friend. Thomas overcame “a difficult upbringing” and later had his views on the law “pilloried by American elites,” according to Ferguson. Rather than “hold grudges against America” for his experience of poverty and segregation, Ferguson says, Thomas pulled himself up by his bootstraps and proved that “any American can overcome the hardships of the past and achieve greatness.” More recently, that success has granted Thomas the opportunity to go on luxury vacations funded by billionaire Republican megadonor Harlan Crow, as ProPublica has reported. He later admitted that he “inadvertently omitted” their disclosure in his past public financial filings. 
While it’s difficult to draw a direct line to how Ferguson will implement these ideas in policy, it’s the latest indication of how the FTC chair will likely steer the agency in a far different direction from that of his predecessor, Lina Khan. He’s already declared that “DEI is over at the FTC,” claiming that any diversity, equity, and inclusion initiative “denies to all Americans the Constitution’s promise of equality before the law.” In pitching himself for the job, Ferguson promised to “fight wokeness,” and “hold big tech accountable and stop censorship,” according to a document obtained by Punchbowl News. On Friday, Ferguson notified FTC staff that the agency would no longer let its political appointees participate in American Bar Association events or leadership, claiming the group has a “long history of leftist advocacy.”
Thomas’ influence on Ferguson could be instructive for the direction of the agency, depending on how closely their views align. Thomas has long opposed affirmative action before getting the opportunity to scuttle it, and expressed heavy skepticism in oral arguments over race-conscious admissions about the virtues of creating a diverse educational environment. He’s gone out of his way to state publicly that the court should narrow Section 230 protections that shield tech platforms from being held responsible for their users’ posts, or moderating content. Ferguson, like Thomas, has expressed the opinion that tech companies have exercised too much power over speech, with too little restraint. Ultimately, Thomas could weigh in on tech cases brought by the FTC in the coming years, including antitrust cases against Meta and Amazon kicked off under prior administrations (in Meta’s case, during Trump’s first term), providing an opportunity to check their market power.

Under Khan, who was appointed chair by former President Joe Biden, the FTC commonly discussed the role of racial bias and discrimination in enforcement actions and reports, and posited diverse hiring as a potential solution to such problems. The FTC under Khan joined other agencies in asserting authority to tackle bias and discrimination in AI-automated systems, for example. In a 2022 report to Congress, FTC staff discussed the role of unconscious bias in contributing to biased outcomes from AI, and suggested dealing directly with “the lack of diversity in the AI field.” Shortly before Inauguration Day, the agency finalized a settlement order with facial recognition company IntelliVision, after accusing it of making “false, misleading, or unsubstantiated claims that its AI-powered facial recognition software was free of gender or racial bias.”
Ferguson’s recent memos to staff indicate he’s already taking a much different approach from Khan. The pullback from the ABA means that, among other things, antitrust defense lawyers will likely not hear directly from FTC officials as they usually do at a massive conference hosted by the association in DC each year. Lawyers, including those who represent Big Tech firms, often attend the conference to learn about the direction of the agency’s enforcement priorities. Ferguson’s declaration came just a few days after the ABA issued a scathing statement condemning Trump administration officials’ statements that appeared to downplay courts’ role, alluding to Vice President JD Vance’s assertion that “Judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.” The FTC chair lambasted the association as “beholden to the interests of Big Tech,” citing its Antitrust Law Section’s critiques of a bill that sought to rein in the industry’s power.
Here’s the full letter Ferguson sent to staff for Black History Month:
Dear Colleagues,
Last Friday, President Trump issued a Presidential Proclamation recognizing February 2025 as National Black History Month, and “call[ed] upon public officials … and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.” In his Proclamation, President Trump correctly noted that “black Americans have been among our country’s most consequential leaders, shaping the cultural and political destiny of our Nation in profound ways,” and identified as “Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Thomas Sowell, and Justice Clarence Thomas” as “American heroes.”
President Trump is right. Justice Thomas is an American hero. He is the most important judge of the last 100 years. He is a good and honorable man, and my friend. Because the President has called upon us to celebrate the achievements of men and women like Justice Thomas during Black History Month, I want to take this occasion to share a little about him.
I encourage anyone who wants to learn about Justice Thomas’s incredible journey to watch the stirring 2020 documentary Created Equal: Clarence Thomas in His Own Words. Descended from West African slaves, Justice Thomas grew up in punishing poverty. He also grew up under a government that denied black citizens equality under the law. He could not walk through certain public parks, enter certain public libraries, or attend certain public schools because of the color of his skin. Justice Thomas thus would have more cause than most to level grievances and hold grudges against America.
But he did the opposite. He believed in the promises of America’s founding, and he climbed to the highest heights of American government and society. One of the things that makes Americans distinct from the rest of the world is our belief that our past is not necessarily our destiny. With hard work, determination, and talent, any American can overcome the hardships of the past and achieve greatness. Justice Thomas is the living embodiment of that American spirit.
He has overcome more than just a difficult upbringing. His views on the law—which he once articulated in lone dissents but which now command a majority of the Court—were pilloried by American elites for years. He was, and is, the target of slurs and calumnies from progressive opponents. Many of these attacks have been explicitly racist. But he is uncowed. The same indominable spirit with which he overcame Jim Crow empowered Justice Thomas to reject elite naysayers and chart his own path in the law—a path that the Supreme Court now follows.
Of course, he did not do this alone. Justice Thomas’s family helped push him to these heights. Justice Thomas’s grandfather, Myers Anderson, a hardworking small-business owner in Savannah, spurred Justice Thomas to excellence. His wife Ginni is an American patriot who has bravely and unapologetically supported her husband throughout his public career, even when his opponents resorted to shocking lies and smears. And Justice Thomas has long identified his deep Catholic faith as a source of strength and courage.
I clerked for Justice Thomas. I came to know him as not just a great man, but also a good and decent person. He loves his law clerks like members of his family. And he knows and cares about the types of people that the average DC titan would pass right by—custodians, assistants, tour guides, and police officers. He remembers their birthdays, their children, and their health struggles.
I can think of no better summary of Justice Thomas’s greatness, and no better defense of America’s promise, than the closing lines of his concurrence in Students for Fair Admission v. Harvard, in which the Supreme Court adopted Justice Thomas’s long-held view that race-conscious admissions policies violate the Constitution’s promise of colorblind equality:
“While I am painfully aware of the social and economic ravages which have befallen my race and all who suffer discrimination, I hold out enduring hope that this country will live up to its principles so clearly enunciated in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States: that all men are created equal, are equal citizens, and must be treated equally before the law.”
I wish you all a happy Black History Month.

15,2025-02-18,"[Michael Wessel] found some of his old DOS 3D graphics software and tried to run it on an 8088 PC. The tale of adding an 8087 co-processor to speed up the rendering was anything but straightforward, resulting in a useful little project.
There was a point around the end of the 1980s when the world of PCs had moved on to the 386, but the humble 8086 and 8088 hung around at the consumer end of the market. For Europeans that meant a variety of non-standard machines with brand names such as Amstrad and Schneider, and even surprisingly, later on Sinclair and Commodore too.
Of these the Schneider Euro PC was an all-in-one design reminiscent of an Amiga or Atari ST, packing a serviceable 8088 PC with a single 3.5″ floppy drive. A cheap machine like this was never thought to need an 8087, and lacked the usual socket on the motherboard, so he made a small PCB daughter board for the 8088 socket with space for both chips.
It’s a surprisingly simple circuit, as obviously the two chips were meant to exist together. It certainly had the desired effect on his frame rate, though we’re not sure how many other Euro PC users will need it. It does make us curious though, as to how quickly a modern microcontroller could emulate an 8087 for an even faster render time. Meanwhile if you’re curious about the 8087, of course [Ken Shirriff] has taken a look at it.
Iirc that’s how 8087 (and 80287) upgrades were frequently sold, as a daughter board that occupied the original CPU socket, and you moved the CPU to the daughter board.
I love to see that these little “Euro PCs” are still out there working. I have mine in a closet with a few tracks burned by the battery fluid :( I hope one day I will have the time and patience (and eyesight) to resurrect it.
A fpga could be used to merge both chips into one.  Couldn’t it?
I worked at Amstrad, and had a totally upgraded PC1512 (RAM, HDs, VGA, Transputer, and anything else that went through R&D) with coprocessor, and a V30 so I could compile CP/M stuff on it natively for the Z80 machines.
It did not have or need a fan. Sir Allan made a press statement (slightly censored here) Along the lines of “If they want a fan on it, we’ll put a fan on it. If they want pink spots on it, we’ll put …ing pink spots on it.”
My machine promptly aquired a folded paper fan, and a quantity of stick-on pink spots.
He referred to me fondly as “that …ing hairy hippie on the 6th floor.” Well, referred anyway.
🤣 thanks for sharing – you gotta love Lord Sugar, such a “sweet” man. I will forever be grateful to him, Roland Perry, and Mark-Eric Jones – for bringing us the Amstrad CPC, my first 8bit home computer (rebuffed as Schneider CPC in Germany).
Should read “rebranded as Schneider CPC”
I bought an Amstrad pc1512 from someone selling them at my university. He had flyers up in the hallways that I noticed. Had just taken my first programming class and was hooked. Took out a $1000 loan, and went to this person’s house where he was selling them off the dining room table.
I too added the v30, and a ridiculously slow 30MB HDD stretched from 20MB using RLL.
Great machine. I graduated and 38 years later still programming.
Love the comment! Reading this brings back fond memories of my teenage years. I, 8088 and also ran 2 Atari 800xl’s and a 10MB MFM hard drive using a mail order external interface.
More than 50 years of labor went into the design/implementation of the 8087, I was told by the designer.
Pohlman, was it?
So, fully burdened, call it $10M development in present-day dollars.  Not at all crazy for a development program.
Roughly speaking, they’d need to have sold 100k of them to call the project a success.  I wonder how many were actually made/sold?
I would say they sold a lot more than 100k. In the early 90’s it was very common to find a few 8087s floating around in the desk drawers of many IT technicians (that was still a time when IT departments were kitted out with EEPROM programmers, UV erasers, logic analyzers, oscilloscopes, etc). Even then they were considered as scrap, and only kept around in case an old XT crept out of the woodwork. In hindsight, I really wish I kept many of those old chips.
Has a similar XT+ I built from a blank pcb. Mostly discrete hand soldered. Only cpu, ram, and boot rom were socketed. Reprogrammed the addressing prom to support the ‘full’ 640K in 4 banks too!
When  “building a PC” was al little more involved.
And what you have in the picture is another interesting twist. The NEC V20 was an Intel 8088 clone with a faster clock speed.
Yep! It doesn’t do miracles, but ~20 % or so are possible for some apps.
No decoupling caps?
On a different not, have you seen the price of 8087 chips on digikey?
Worth their weight in gold.
Well, these prices are obviously nuts… mine are from eBay, ~ 20 $ for a 8087-2, about 35 $ for a 8087-1 (10 MHz certified). Decoupling caps are overrated, and the main CPU socket itself already has one ;-)
Skipping on decoupling caps is like not putting your seatbelt on.
The risk of a crash may be low, but the cost is high.
Dealing with intermittently failure is not fun.
Just like putting your seatbelt on, sticking decoupling caps on everything makes good habits.
“sticking decoupling caps on everything makes good habits.”
Within reason, and with sensible engineering guidance.
I have a device that is powered by a buck regulator with some capacitance in it.  Running off a 13.8 V battery it works fine.  Running directly off the 14.4 V charger is fine.  Turning it on when the battery is being charged is fine.  But plugging the charger into the board while it is powered by the battery promptly resets it, but only sometimes.
When that connection is made there’s enough ringing between the charger output cap and the buck regulator input cap that the voltage excursion is enough to cause a reset. (or RFI generated or regulator not keeping up with the fast transition, or maybe something else)
Sprinkling caps around without consideration of how the ringing will get damped can ALSO lead to hard-to-diagnose intermittent failures.
I need to figure out the least invasive way to suppress the ringing.  It might be as simple as a small resistor in series in the charger power line, or perhaps a NTC inrush limiter or a diode.  It’s hard to reproduce reliably, so one of those PITA things to fix.
Maybe you should remove a cap instead?
Usually,  I add them to me PCBs. Forgot them this time.
Back then I wrote a Mandelbrot graphics program that performed all the calculations on the 8087. I wrote the code in assembler so that all the calculations were “in stack”. The resulting performance allowed me to zoom in and explore Mandelbrot space displayed on a 1024 x 768 resolution screen. Without the 8087, rendering would have taken over a week for one screen.
Nice! Would love to try it… do you have the code somewhere? AFAIK, Fractint is doing without 8087, but I am sure there must be other programs around that rely heavily on the 8087, like yours does. Would love to get some more number crunching software for the machine.
Seeing how fast a modern microcontroller would emulate an 8088 or 8087 or both in drop-in form would indeed be interesting.  There’s some Amiga upgrades now that do this, it drops into the Motorola 680×0 socket and is (as I recall) using the cpu emulator from uae (unix amiga emulator) and i guess code so it frobs the right pins on the 68k socket.  My recollection is since the Amiga already had a ‘weird’ setup with chip ram and slow ram (something like that… my pre-pc use was with Atari 8-bits…) that it could use system ram while also presenting the free ram on the Raspberry Pi or whatever as additional RAM for the Amiga’s use.

16,2025-02-18,"Intel (INTC-5.91%) stock was rising sharply on Tuesday morning as investors weighed the benefits of reported plans that could see rivals acquire parts of its business.
One plan could see Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which is already responsible for about 90% of the world’s advanced semiconductors, acquire Intel’s manufacturing business, The New York Times reported. It could also take a majority stake in the business alongside a group of private equity and tech companies. 
That idea has been pushed by President Donald Trump’s administration and Howard Lutnick, his nominee to be Commerce Secretary. Frank Yeary, Intel’s interim executive chair, has met with both TSMC (TSM-0.93%) and Trump administration officials about the deal, The Times reported. 
While the Trump administration asked TSMC to explore the idea, the White House is unlikely to support a deal that would let a foreign entity operate Intel’s factories, the Wall Street Journal reported. 
Broadcom (AVGO-0.56%) has also been examining Intel’s chip design and manufacturing business, The Journal reported,  citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. The deal, which Broadcom executives have only informally discussed, would hinge on finding a partner to take over Intel’s manufacturing business, The Journal reported. Nothing has been submitted to Intel yet.
Qualcomm (QCOM+0.68%) has also been interested in buying some of Intel’s chip design units. Yeary has left the door open for other companies interested in buying Intel’s product business, including Qualcomm, The Times reported. 
Intel stock surged 10% in Tuesday morning trading. The stock has rallied to start the year.
The potential deals come a few months after Intel ousted its former CEO, who failed to help modernize and stabilize the tech giant, which has struggled to compete with rivals such as Nvidia (NVDA-0.20%) and TSMC. The company has also hired help to fend off potential activist investors.
In August, Intel announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025 through measures including a 15% reduction of its workforce. The following month, the company said it would further separate its chip-manufacturing and design operations, and pause factory projects in Germany, Poland, and Malaysia.
Despite its issues, Intel said last month that it expects to report break-even profit for the first quarter of 2025, after reporting declining revenue for three periods in a row. In November, the company was awarded a $7.86 billion grant by then-President Joe Biden’s administration to build semiconductors in the U.S. The Trump administration is expected to rely on Intel to make domestic chips, at least as long as TSMC declines to move operations to the U.S.

17,2025-02-18,"Chances are you’ve used a clunky PayPal (PYPL-0.34%) button to buy something online, especially if you’re over 40.
PayPal has been a pioneer of e-commerce since its early days, and the company continues to deliver strong earnings. But shareholders have been sending the stock slumping recently as fears grow over its ability — or inability —to compete at a basic level: consumer check-out. Rivals including Apple (AAPL+0.23%), Google (GOOGL+0.63%), Shopify (SHOP-1.83%), and scrappy upstarts such as Bolt have been chipping away at PayPal’s check-out dominance. 
The stock, which was down slightly on Tuesday afternoon, has fallen almost 10% so far this year and 13% over the last month.
Business owners who depend on online check-out generally agreed in interviews that PayPal is in need of some refreshing. Lou Haverty, the owner of Skid Retailer, which sells industrial equipment online, said PayPal is cumbersome and expensive.
“I can tell you from experience in my store that the vast majority of my customers use Shopify Shop Pay to check out,” Haverty said, adding that only about 15% to 20% of customers use PayPal.
“Most customers will go with the option that requires the least clicks,” Haverty said. “When selling on a Shopify store like I do, the Shop Pay checkout is the easiest with the least clicks.”
Brian Lim, owner and founder of online brands iHeartRaves and Into the AM, and a former contestant on ABC’s (DIS+1.61%) Shark Tank, said PayPal has to reclaim its roots as a checkout option.
“Transactions today are all about two things — speed and seamlessness,” Lim said. “While PayPal has a strong reputation, using the service often feels like an added step instead of a natural part of the process.” Lim pointed to competing buttons like Apple Pay, which integrates directly into devices, and Shopify’s Shop Pay, which is focused on e-commerce merchants.
 “Those buttons — Shopify and Apple Pay — feel tailored and frictionless,” Lim said.
Lim said PayPal has shown signs of drifting off course by not adapting its usability to consumers’ evolving expectations.
“PayPal needs to improve on its native integrations, employ quicker methods of authentication such as streamlined biometrics, and provide better rewards for loyalty,” Lim said, adding that the market is shifting toward non-intrusive payments like one-click transactions and automatic backend billing systems that do not disrupt the user experience.
“PayPal needs to focus on where consumers already are,” Lim said, “be it mobile-first environments or voice-commanded payments, while eliminating everything that feels outdated.”

19,2025-02-18,The Dow Jones was lower on the stock market today after U.S.-Russia talks. A new Warren Buffett stock popped. Nvidia rallied but Meta slid.
20,2025-02-18,"Canadian start-up Edison Motors may not seem like much at first glance — consisting of fewer than two dozen people in a large tent — but their idea of bringing series hybrid technology to semi-trucks may just have wheels. The concept and Edison Motors’ progress is explained in a recent video by The Drive on Youtube, starting off with the point that diesel-electric technology is an obvious fit for large trucks like this. After all, it works for trains.
In a series hybrid, there are two motors: a diesel generator and an electric motor (diesel-electric). This was first used in ships in the 1900s and would see increasing use in railway locomotives starting in the early 20th century. In the case of Edison Motors’ current prototype design there is a 9.0 liter Scania diesel engine which is used solely as a generator at a fixed RPM. This is a smaller engine than the ~15 liter engine in a conventional configuration and also doesn’t need a gearbox.
Compared to a battery-electric semi-truck, like the Tesla Semi, it weighs far less. And unlike a hydrogen-fuel cell semi-truck it actually exists and doesn’t require new technologies to be invented. Instead a relatively small battery is kept charged by the diesel generator and power fed back into the battery from regenerative braking. This increases efficiency in many ways, especially in start-stop traffic, while not suffering a weight penalty from a heavy battery pack and being able to use existing service stations, and jerry cans of diesel.
In addition to full semi-trucks Edison Motors also works on conversion kits for existing semi-trucks, pick-up trucks and more. Considering how much of the North American rolling stock  on its rail systems is diesel-electric, it’s more amazing that it would have taken so long for the same shift to series hybrid on its road. Even locomotives occasionally used direct-drive diesel, but the benefits of diesel-electric hybrids quickly made that approach obsolete.


I don’t know why but hybrid trucks were a big thing in the EU about 10 years ago, but it looks like the manufacturers stopped producing them. The Volvo FE Hybrid for example was a great truck, but they aren’t for sale anymore. There are now full electric versions for shorter distances but the long distance trucks are still all diesel. Scania also stopped producing hybrid trucks. I know local emission laws can be a bit troublesome, especially when there are so many countries in such a small area with different laws and regulations. Even within countries it can be a problem. Different cities can have different rules and hybrid diesels are often just regulated the same way as regular diesels, even if they can drive a short distance using full electric. It seems like the best vehicle to make hybrid. The title of the video is a bit bad though but the truck looks great.
Manufacturers respond to regulations, not reason. And the regulations are not based on reason, they are mostly capricious labyrinthine things written up by people without any real domain knowledge who could only hold down a job as a career bureaucrat

  but the long distance trucks are still all diesel

That’s because the benefits of a hybrid drivetrain mostly vanish in long distance driving where the engine can operate at optimum speeds and loads for the vast majority of the time without starting and stopping very often, while the downsides like the extra cost and the multiple failure points of a more complicated system, and the lower efficiency of a generator-motor setup start to dominate the calculation.
Trains use diesel-electric systems because the mechanical gearbox of a diesel locomotive is a very complicated thing and gets more complicated or impossible to build when you’re trying to drive multiple wheels in multiple cars at the same time. Trucks operating on the motorways aren’t that complicated, so they don’t really gain anything from a series-hybrid configuration.
I see a lot of hybrid buses here in Tallinn (Estonia) made by Volvo. On the other note, my Nissan XTrail e-4orce SUV is using exactly the same concept I can drive in city (stop and go) with petrol consumtion as low as 5 liters/100km and countryside depending on speed is similar.
I’ve been following these guys a while, mostly through DeBoss Garage, who are making a light-duty hybrid truck conversion kit based on Edison’s same technology. I really appreciate Edison’s no-nonsense way of tackling problems that should have been solved years ago using existing technology. Full EV technology is the ‘sexy’ way to solve transportation problems these days, and I think at this point it’s all fluff (marketing, politics, lobbying…). Burning hydrocarbons are just so much more energy dense than using a battery full time. It’s a real shame that a plug-in hybrid truck isn’t available for those of us that need them and only have a 40 minute round-trip commute.
… and doesn’t cost upwards of 100K plus, and/or loaded down with all the luxury features that add complexity and cost to the vehicle.
:: points finger of death at the Hummer EV, Rivian, and the F150 Lightning ::
But then, I’ve ranted about my perfect EV before, so I’ll shut up. :)
Was hoping that this would have occurred throughout the transportation sector.  I have 2 gasoline hybrid cars.  They’re great.  But I always wondered when the series hybrid would make an appearance on all vehicles.  Great application for a hybrid or a PHEV.  As battery technology advances full electric may be attainable, but we got a long way to go and should do everything we can to become cleaner and more efficient.
Hope they’re successful.  Wonder if they’ll consider going public.  I’d invest.
They’ve had some investor rounds, but I think its limited in the US at this time
They already exist as a few models cars – e.g. BMW i3 and Nissan ‘e-drive’ cars such as the Note. Not sure why it hasn’t spread further.
Nissan did it because it was cheaper to implement and less mechanically complicated than a traditional hybrid setup. It is less efficient than a traditional active hybrid where the engine can directly drive the wheels at highway speed. Fine in the city though. The i3 was more of an EV with a range extender than a series hybrid though. Especially since you could get it as a pure EV with the same battery.
That’s how the Chevy Volt worked, no?

Anything is better than Tesla.
It’s really funny how quickly people will turn on the largest electric car manufacturer who basically single-handedly revived the electric car because of ideology. I thought the climate was important?
Why are people turning on BYD?
What did they do?
Is it just anti-china hatred driving this?
In 2024, BYD produced more electric vehicles than Tesla for the first time. BYD made 1,777,965 vehicles, while Tesla produced 1,773,443.
There is this place called “not the US”. They actually also buy cars.
Nissan was the biggest seller for years.
Tesla led for only about 2 years, because they were the cheapest new EV on the market, and had a production surplus, so you could get one.
BYD makes multiple kinds of cars that we want to buy: cars, pickups, suvs, ev, phev. They have high technical credibility.
Tesla makes a single type of somewhat impractical novelty car that would not be the first choice of a most people, given a price and availabilty competitor.
Now Tesla is also starting to get negative catchet and a reputation for repair problems, parts gouging, shady business practices, outright fraud, deaths.
But offering what people actually want is the biggy. Tesla’s product appeals to a smallish novelty segment – and novelty is not a lasting quality.
I had never heard of BYD before — perhaps they don’t sell in my market?  Choice is a great thing when it actually exists.
@asheets: BYD vehicles seem to be everywhere on Australian roads at the moment. According to Amnesty International they recently scored the lowest ranking on Human Rights over their battery materials mining.
It hasn’t been that quck, its taken years for Musk to wear down the good-will that their car was granted for making a production electric car. ‘Largest electric manufacturer’ hasn’t to date been much of a bar to get over since close to no corporations were producing them. It was all small producers.  Now the actual largest car manufacturers are coming online with better specced, higher quality, and cheaper models while also having the production capacity to overtake Tesla.
 Shown in the numbers by Tesla sales being down 30% while EV sales in general are up %15 year on year.
The climate is important. But das leader is working hard to destroy the environment and institutions put in place to regulate environmental damage. While his one environmental positive product is largely focused at the luxury market reducing its penetration,  and has been totally overtaken by other options that do less harm overall.
Good reply
I think that the Cybertruk it’s a blunder because it’s totally impractical. An Electric Ford Transit van base model costs £45000+VAT, and a plumber or a carpenter is going to buy that. For around £40000 you can get either a base Tesla Model 3 or a base Ford Explorer EV, and other manufacturers are selling EV with similar prices.
The problem with Ford and other carmaker is that they don’t make a small car like the Fiesta: actually they stopped making the petrol Fiesta in 2023.

  who basically single-handedly revived the electric car because of ideology.

If we forget Nissan, which started selling EVs in 2009 and sold more units than any Tesla globally until Tesla finally overtook it in 2018.
And Tesla could only do that because of the massive $10B influx of cash from investors.  Who are getting (even more) rich now offloading their stock to everyman mom & pop retail investors who will be left holding the bag.
The same thing is going to happen with Starlink, but even worse because of  the ongoing constellation maintenance expense ($100M per week by some estimates).
Also, Nissan was the first company to put lithium batteries in EVs, and they did so in 1996.
Tesla wasn’t even first in coming up with the idea of using consumer grade standard cells to reduce cost, because Nissan and Sony did it over a decade earlier.
The only thing that Tesla did and how they were successful was to collect investor money on future promises and then burn the money away for more than a decade until the researchers in the field managed to improve the lithium-ion cells’ energy density and lower the manufacturing cost enough to be profitable. That work was done by Panasonic, LG, and others, not Tesla who simply bought the technology off the shelf.
Climate IS important, but having Elon Musk ravage the backend of our government is not something that I will forgive in the name of pushing battery electric vehicles.
It’s just amazing to see how quickly he’s burned through the public approval he had just a few years ago.
Had or hadn’t. Not everyone bought the hype – a lot of people saw through the whole charade and warned you about Musk years ago.
Producing a minimal amount of premium sedans surely saved the environment
Yes, it actually DID, because it was the kick in the ass that the rest of the industry needed.
Not really.
In 2023,
GM turned out ~6.2M cars
Hyundai group dropped  7.3M
VW Group moved 9.3M.
Toyota pushed over 11.5M
Tesla only managed to produce ~1.9M in 2023.
Their total company LIFETIME production doesnt even meet Hyundais 2023 figure.
Tesla wasnt the motivator. Theyre barely a blip. Theyre not a serious contender in the AutoSpace. Theyre a virtue signaling luxury brand whose CEO is rapidly diminishing their overinflated prestige and valuation.
Lead acid and NIHM batteries werent good enough in the 90s and lithium ion batteries were too expensive.
Increased global lithium production reducing battery price, coupled with increased environmental regulations and political pressure to reduce gasoline and diesel consumption played a much greater role in motivating Big Auto than some billionaires limited line of rich boy toys.
GM actually scaled BACK its EV production goals due to a lack of demand. Range anxiety and price (of batteries) are still holding back the market.
“unlike a hydrogen-fuel cell semi-truck it actually exists and doesn’t require new technologies to be invented.”
There are currently 48 Hyundai XCIENT Fuel Cell trucks in operation, deployed across logistics, distribution, and retail fleet operators; these trucks have collectively driven over 10 million kilometers
As of Q3 last year Nikola had delievered 235 of their hydrogen fuel cell semis to customers.
They actually exist. What new technologies need to be invented?
Technology is not the choke point for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The slow proliferation of fueling stations is all that stands in this technologies way.
Technology ‘existing’ in this context also means the technology to produce the things at scale and the infrastructure to widely support them. Those don’t exist in the context of hydrogen-fuel cell technology. We can make small numbers of a lot of things that aren’t practical to solve problems at the scale we need them.
the statement was “require new technologies to be invented.” not infrastructure to support.  This is false, Fuel cell technology works. The only thing slowing its adoption and scaling is the demand which has been limited by a lack of fuel delivery infrastructure.
PEM fuel cells running on compressed or liquid hydrogen is what “works” right now, but the energy density of hydrogen is very poor and you can’t run much power for very long between re-fueling. The safety aspect is also a bit… not there really. If you start scaling up the hydrogen delivery infrastructure and the number of hydrogen cars beyond a few enthusiast adopters, you’re going to get a lot of explosions and fires. Fuel cell cars are nice toys and technology demos, but not ready for productive use.
The technology that needs to be invented is: 1) how to burn other stuff than pure hydrogen to get more hydrogen to fit in the fuel tank in a safer form, 2) what is that stuff and how are you going to distribute it, 3) how to make it all cheap and durable.
SOFCs are a candidate for making hydrogen fuel cell cars basically universal by being able to burn just about any liquid or gaseous fuel that contains hydrogen, but the cost and durability are not there yet. The technology to make hydrogen economically out of something other than natural gas is also pretty much not present. You can run expensive electrolysers with subsidized electricity to make it happen, but that’s just hiding the cost of it – it’s not commercially viable business yet.
Yeah technology is probably not the right word here. I’d say it’s even worse though; hydrogen fuel cells require some new economy to be invented.
A hydrogen car is only appealing if there are hydrogen stations blanketing the country. But building tens of thousands of hydrogen fuel stations is only appealing if there are millions of hydrogen cars already on the road. Chicken and egg.
Battery cars avoid this catch 22 since they can be refilled anywhere there is electrical service. My 2013 electric car was fueled by a 120v outlet in my garage for many years.
Hybrid cars avoid the catch 22 since they can be refilled at existing fuel stations.
You can also build hydrogen stations with electrolysis. All you need is water and electricity. The issue is that now you are losing half the efficiency of a battery electric vehicle. The only real upside is energy density. Even then though, solid state batteries will most likely solve this in a few years. Far too few to build out hydrogen infrastructure first.
The real efficiency of a battery EV isn’t actually that great. That’s because a lithium battery costs a lot of energy to make: equivalent to 200-400 full cycles of the battery, while the total energy throughput over the lifespan of the battery/car is on the order of 500-1000 cycles. We’re talking about Energy Stored over Energy Invested (ESOEI) which depends on the fundamental technology and how you use the technology. The embedded energy cost to build the battery is around a quarter to a half of the energy you end up using to drive the car anyways.
In other words, if you have a long range EV that’s driven relatively little over the years, the true energy efficiency may not be much better or even worse than a gasoline ICE vehicle. To get the efficiency, you need to put cycles through the battery, which means you either have a tiny battery or you drive way more than the average person – like a million miles more.
That’s also a major reason why electric cars failed in the 90’s. The ESOEI of lead-acid and NiMH batteries is so bad that their real efficiency was far worse than that of gasoline powered vehicles. They wouldn’t have solved anything.
I’ve never understood why trucks are as aerodynamic as a brick. Considering the mileage covered, every single aero mod would be hugely beneficial.
I think Edison is aimed more at logging trucks and other heavy haul trucks that dont benefit much from aerodynamics
The Edison Motors trucks are meant for logging up in Canada, not long distance, not high speed. Truly just high torque and weight capacity, hence why the tesla semi is more sleek and aerodynamic
There’s not much you can do to a vehicle that size anyhow, without attaching some crazy Concorde type nose to it. You can round the front a little bit, but it’s still going to be about as aerodynamic as a barn door.
For a while I remember seeing panels on the back of trailers that could be unfolded to make the rear more teardrop shaped, then folded back up when it was time to back into a loading dock.  Haven’t seen any in a long time, though.
I mean, do a google image search for “18 wheeler” and note that most of them are actually pretty aerodynamic considering the design constraints. The constraints I can think of are that the payload is containerized (a standardized rectangular box) so it has to have a specific hight and width. And the there is an engine that requires a lot of airflow cooling, and a driver who requires visibility. So you make a wedge shape with some vertical surfaces for windows and air intake. Even the Tesla Semi looks the same, minus the air intake.
There are some companies that make caps or fins that go on the rear of the truck to reduce tailwind vortices. But the impact is marginal and they take effort to operate.
The truly brick-shaped trucks are things like dump trucks that are not made for highway travel so aerodynamics are unnecessary.

  I’ve never understood why trucks are as aerodynamic as a brick.
   

Because of EU-wide regulations specifying maximum vehicle size, and truck manufacturers optimizing their vehicles for the highest possible amount of goods transported within given dimmensions. Efficiency comes second.
You could make a very aerodynamic truck, but what’s the point if can only haul like 5 tons of cargo? Or you could make a very aerodynamic truck that’s able to haul 40 tons of cargo, but on every single ride you’d have to obtain permission for special transport (like they do nowdays with trucks carrying military tanks or large excavators) and hire a pilot.
Over the year we found a good enough compromise between wasting some fuel on air resistance and being able to haul useful load within existing road infrastructure.
No, it is because shipping containers are standardized boxes and there are overall length restrictions on truck with road design also being affected by those length restrictions.
Regulations puts an upper limit on how long you can make a truck. Which is why you see so many flat nose trucks in Europe. Those cab-over engine trucks couldn’t be any more like a brick.
Dog nose trucks are slightly more aerodynamic, and there are some pretty wild designs around that that reduce the cab space dramatically but provide better aerodynamics. For long haul drivers that live out of their cab, those tiny cabs aren’t practical either.
Better aerodynamics of the box trailer is probably the least effort for the most benefit. And it doesn’t depend on the truck. It slightly reduces the volume of the trailer, but in many cases it’s the weight limit that is hit first.
Transport efficiency doesn’t happen on rubber wheels. While on the road every % gained has a huge advertisement echo, the real savings are done on iron wheels and rails. There is an order of magnitude between them in energy consumption, think about it.
If the added complexity significantly reduces the mean time to failure then it is simply not worth it.
This sounds like a good idea, but the article doesn’t mention: have they made measurable efficiency gains over traditional traction? Do they have a goal in mind?
Here it is, from their website FAQ:
“Fuel savings largely depends on the application the truck is used for.  Over the road trucking shows the least amount of fuel savings 5-10%.  Logging and city vocational operations show the largest fuel savings at 70-100% fuel reduction.  Basically the more starting and stopping done the better the savings, the harder you work the truck and the steeper your terrain the better your fuel savings.  These trucks are engineered to work as hard as possible and due their best performance when used that way.”
Makes sense that a regenerative braking system would do worst in a long-haul application
Not just that but effectively having infinite gears with instant shifts. The engine can always run at optimum speed with no lugging.
Well, not always. Once the battery is full, you have to throttle down to the actual load of the motor, or start/stop the engine repeatedly and grind the battery to bits.
It has to have some long range advantages considering Audi RS Q e-tron series Hybrid took Dakar win in 2024.
I don’t think that a fuel savings of 100% has ever been achieved.
electric dump trucks  sometimes run greater than 100% fuel savings. Their regenerative braking coming down the mountain to the processing plant fully loaded can produce so much energy they sometimes not only dump their load, but also dump a portion of their battery charge before heading back up to the mine.
I’m surprised no one mentioned the Mazda rotary-electric hybrids.
While it is not the same, the ideas overlap: rotary internal combustion engines aren’t simple to use with a “normal” drive train, so what they did try was to hook it up to a small generator, the engine would then spin up to “optimal” range and drive the generator – this can be then used to charge/power an electric vehicle drive-train.
I’m not sure what Mazda is doing with that (if at all) nowadays, but the nice thing is that it allows for a normally fully electric vehicle with quick “charging”/fueling in case you don’t have access to charger infrastructure or don’t have the time to wait for the batteries to charge up.
I’m not sure what is not simple about use with a normal drive train – that’s what they were developed for in the first place.  The biggest advantage of Wankel rotaries is a very high power to volume and power to weight ratios, which I would think would make them close to ideal for hybrid vehicles, which have a bunch of high-volume components.
Pyramid scheme.
The biggest problem with electric trucks is weight.  The weight of the battery systems reduces the cargo carrying capacity of the truck and containers are loaded with an eye to the weight limits of diesel semi trucks.  If your truck was electric you would most likely be overweight with a fully laden container.  Secondly recharge times are an issue because many truck in the US operate with team drivers and are moving almost 24/7.  Route planning would have to take into account large charging stations availability.  Lastly if you try to avoid the charging issue by going hybrid, you now have the weight and complexity of the diesel power package in addition to the battery/motor combination weight.
The most energy efficient way to make use of this technology already exists.  You transport by rail to the nearest terminal and then truck the cargo the rest of the way to the destination.
Rail is a trillion dollar solution and is outside of the ability of most startups and non-government funded change. While it is a great solution the USA is way behind and it would take decades to get any motion.
If you haven’t already check out https://www.edisonmotors.ca/ You are correct that a full electric conversion is not possible without swappable batteries (and all of the issues that presents) there are paths forward which are in motion.
Why has no one mentioned the RAM Ramcharger? For a light truck with the driving character of electric (instant torque, quiet operation) and for a contractor you can use AC power from the battery and on board inverter to run your jobsite needs. The proven V6 engine can be run at the highest efficiency possible then shut down. In the city you can plug it into the grid for full charge when you leave home base and in the country or mountains you can fill the gas tank and still get better mpg than a regular full size truck. What is not to like?
For OTR it would have the same benefits: more efficient and clean burning with a much smaller and lighter diesel engine, but more torque and horsepower from the electric drivetrain. You could have a smaller /lighter fuel tank and still have all day range for long haul routes. Additional benefits are regenerative braking for a fully loaded truck would be safer and far quieter than an exhaust brake. For the driver, you could have almost unlimited AC/DC and HVAC available when parked either for a rest break or at a customer and large truck serviced facilities are now required to account for and limit the environmental impact of the diesel trucks on site.
For refrigerated carriers, you could have a power connection from the truck’s hybrid system to the trailer refrigeration unit and only need to maintain one diesel for the two units, and with an all electric reefer, you can put a plug in system in place and have zero emissions when parked on your yard or at a warehouse. If the power is connected both direction, you could have solar panels on the entire roof of the trailer for considerable additional power input. You could have your parked units always charged up, and with bidirectional connections to your building the panels could be reducing your grid draw.
Bottom line is that I have always wondered why series diesel electric is not the default setup for commercial vehicles.

One of President Donald Trump's top health-related nominees has had a unique income source over the past two years: posting on social media.

Jay Bhattacharya, Trump's nominee for director of the National Institutes of Health, made $11,995 last year as part of X's content-creator revenue program, according to a financial disclosure filed this month.
    

        Under that program, which Elon Musk instituted after he took over the social media platform and renamed it, users with a premium account can receive payouts based on engagement from other premium users.
    

        Before Trump announced his nomination in late November, Bhattacharya was a frequent poster on X, where he boasts more than 680,000 followers. He joined the creator revenue program in 2023. His ethics agreement says Bhattacharya has ""ceased creating content for compensation"" and has ""ceased sharing in revenue for content creation for X.""
    

        Bhattacharya rose to prominence in 2020 as a critic of COVID-19 lockdowns and was a coauthor of the ""Great Barrington Declaration,"" which promoted a ""herd immunity"" strategy against the virus. In a statement, a White House spokesman, Kush Desai, argued that Americans had ""lost confidence in the medical apparatus that let us down during the COVID pandemic"" and touted Bhattacharya as the ""perfect pick"" for the role.
    

        ""Dr. Jay Bhattacharya has been a leading voice in support of greater transparency and efficacy in our healthcare bodies, and that's exactly why he is the perfect pick to lead the NIH and help deliver on President Trump's resounding mandate to Make America Healthy Again by restoring confidence, competence, and accountability in health care,"" Desai said. ""We look forward to his swift confirmation by the Senate.""
    

        Bhattacharya's main occupation isn't posting on X: He earned $457,743 last year as a professor at Stanford University.
    

        He also made thousands of dollars from paid speeches: $20,000 from the conservative Bradley Impact Fund in October, $3,500 from the Global Liberty Institute in July, and $2,272 from Hillsdale College in October.
    

        Bhattacharya also owns thousands of dollars' worth of stock in Walmart, Nvidia, and Taiwan Semiconductor, which he has agreed to divest if confirmed.
    

        Bhattacharya did not respond to a request for comment.
    

        Trump's nominees are required to file public financial disclosures describing how they made money in recent years. Recent filings include those from Pam Bondi, the attorney general; Kash Patel, the nominee for FBI director; Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence; and Pete Hegseth, the secretary of defense.

Argentine President Javier Milei is facing a legal investigation and impeachment calls after he promoted a cryptocurrency that quickly collapsed.

        Milei endorsed the $libra meme coin Friday in social media posts. He said it would boost the country's economy by funding small businesses and entrepreneurs.
    

        His endorsement sent the token soaring from almost nothing to above $4 — before it fell to less than $0.50 just hours later after the posts were deleted, Reuters reported.
    

        Observatorio del Derecho a la Ciudad, a nongovernmental organization in Argentina, said some 40,000 people had been affected, with losses above $4 billion.
    

        Argentina's main stock index closed more than 5% lower on Monday.
    

Meme coins are sometimes based on internet jokes and fads, such as doge. Personalities have also jumped on the bandwagon to launch their own tokens, including the boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. — and even President Donald Trump and Melania Trump, the first lady.
    

        The launch of the $Trump and $Melania coins last month sparked anger in the crypto world, with some commentators saying the Trumps were making a mockery of the industry.
    

        Lawyers in Argentina filed fraud complaints in criminal court over the weekend. Some have speculated that the case against Milei could be classified as a ""rug pull,"" when promoters of a coin attract buyers but then stop trading before it crashes, which allows them to pocket some of the proceeds.
    

        Jonatan Baldiviezo, one of the plaintiffs, told The Associated Press that the president's actions meant a ""crime of fraud was committed.""
    

        A judge was assigned on Monday to investigate the case.
    

        Argentina's main opposition coalition said it would move forward with its push to impeach Milei, writing in an X post that his involvement in the coin was an ""unprecedented scandal.""
    

        Milei's office said Sunday in a statement on X that the president ""shared a post on his personal accounts announcing the launch of the KIP Protocol project, just as he does daily with many entrepreneurs who want to launch a project in Argentina to create jobs and get investments.""
    

        It added: ""Not having been part of any stage of the development of the cryptocurrency, after the repercussions that the launch of the project had and to avoid any speculation and not give it further dissemination, he decided to delete the post.""
    

        KIP Protocol said on X it was involved with distributing project funds to businesses in Argentina and did not have any role with the coin itself.
    

        Ben Chow, a cofounder of Meteora, the platform behind $libra, has stepped down following the controversy, a statement on X from Meow said Tuesday.
    

        Meow cofounded Meteora and is behind Jupiter, which calls itself ""one of the largest decentralized trading platforms and one of the most active governance communities in crypto.""
    

        The statement said Chow had ""shown a lack of judgment and care about some of the core aspects of the project (given its current size and reputation) over the past couple of months"" and had ""chosen to resign.""
    

        Meow also said in the statement: ""No one at Jupiter or Meteora committed any insider trading or financial wrongdoing, or received any tokens inappropriately.""
    

        The law firm Fenwick & West has been hired to investigate and plans to independently publish a report, Meow added.
    

        It's unclear why Meow uses a pseudonym. He was seen in a video interview in February 2024 on the YouTube crypto channel The Defiant.
    

        On his website, Meow calls himself a ""Cat @ Jupiter,"" adding: ""Previously, lead adviser at Instadapp, Fluid, Kyber and Blockfolio. I was one of the founding contributors to Handshake. Also started Meteora, home to the best liquidity protocols and LP army.""

24,2025-02-18,"Another strong look at the potential future of Google's next budget Pixel.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The leaks keep coming as another report claims to have revealed the specs of Google's upcoming budget Pixel.
The company's affordable Pixel 9a reportedly had its specifications leaked by WinFuture (German). The publication cites ""available technical data,"" stating the Pixel 9a could hit the market with a 6.3-inch OLED display with a max 120Hz refresh rate. The panel allegedly supports HDR10 Plus, as well. The post includes a rumored look at the device in four colors; however, the highlight is this screen's bezels.
A glance suggests the Pixel 9a will have slightly thicker bezels compared to the flagship Pixel 9 series. The phone's leaked renders show a completely flat screen and sides alongside rounded corners — which stays within Google's theme.
The back is another area where we could see change as rumors continue to claim there's a dual-camera array in our future. Of course, this is similar to the base Pixel 9; however, the Pixel 9a could see a 48MP primary lens with OIS (optical image stabilization) and a 13MP ultrawide lens. These lenses contrast the vanilla Pixel 9's 50MP and 48MP alternatives.
What's more, the housing array is in focus as Google may drop the thick, protruding camera visor on the Pixel 9a. The renderings claim the array will be minimal and flush to the back panel for a near-flat surface.
Rumors add the phone may debut with a 5,100mAh battery, as well as a 128GB and a 256GB storage option with 8GB RAM across both. Google's Tensor G4, which is packed into the flagship Pixel 9 series, is expected to power the Pixel 9a. Once again, the post reiterates colors we've seen before, like Obsidian, Porcelain, Peony, and Iris.
Lastly, the publication suggests the Pixel 9a could see a starting price of €499 in Europe (~$520).

The alleged specs of the Pixel 9a have been surfacing since December, which is when we first got a glimpse of its potential contents. The current rumors double down on several aspects such as its 6.3-inch display, color options, usage of the Tensor G4, and primary camera strength. Curiously, the leaked pricing from last year claims the U.S. could see the same price tag as what's rumored for Europe: $499 for its base model. A rumored price hike was stated for the larger 256GB option.
Regarding the renders, we've seen similar aesthetics and designs leaked before and those have remained consistent through the latest ones.
Google typically unveils the current series' A-series phone the following year (toward the spring) and recent rumors state that could happen again. Speculation claims Google is preparing for a March 26 debut for the Pixel 9a with pre-orders opening one week beforehand (around March 19).

Baidu reported Q4 2024 financial results after the close in Hong Kong and before US markets opened this morning. Expectations going into the release were muted, especially following Founder and CEO Robin Li’s absence from President Xi’s historic private economy symposium attended by internet and technology entrepreneurs. In Li’s defense, the event timing could not have been worse with today’s financial release and the preparation around it. People often ask us about Baidu as the stock has struggled lately despite its AI focus. Tuesday’s results provide one indication that financial metrics shrank year-over-year (YoY).
The company’s search business depends on advertisers, whose budgets have yet to fully recover from the pandemic, and, more recently, real estate’s effect on consumption and increased competition in app ecosystems. In the company’s defense, it receives no credit from investors for its AI Cloud, ERNIE large language model (LMM), or Apollo Go program, Baidu’s autonomous ride-hailing service, which provided 1.1 million rides in Q4. As of 8:30 a.m., management has not mentioned pursuing a Hong Kong dual share class, which would allow for Southbound Stock Connect flows.
Asian equities were largely higher overnight despite the U.S. dollar strengthening overnight. Hong Kong led the push higher on very high volumes, the Philippines and Pakistan outperformed, while Mainland China underperformed after afternoon profit-taking.
President Xi’s meeting with technology entrepreneurs Monday was still the talk of the town as Xi rarely meets with such executives. It indicates the economy’s need for private enterprises while lowering regulatory risks. Xinhua’s article only noted several attendees explicitly stating “Huawei's Ren Zhengfei, BYD's Wang Chuanfu, New Hope's Liu Yonghao, Will Semiconductor's Yu Renrong, Unitree Robotics' Wang Xingxing, and Xiaomi's Lei Jun put forward their opinions and advice on the development of the private sector.” The photos show that Alibaba’s Jack Ma and Tencent’s Pony Ma were there. The private sector focus raises expectations for next month's dual sessions, the government's big legislative meetings that set the budget and expenditures.
Although it was not widely broadcasted or discussed, the National People's Congress (NStanding Committee will meet in Beijing on February 24t and 25t, in advance of the Dual Sessions, to “review the draft law on the promotion of private economy.”
The visual of internet CEOs standing in the same room as Xi led to a strong move overnight. As a result, Hong Kong’s most heavily traded stocks by value were Tencent, up +2.01%; Alibaba, up +3.36%; Xiaomi, up +7.2%; Meituan, up +2.37%, and Kuaishou, up +9.61%.
Hong Kong volumes were elevated, at 235% of the 1-year average, as Tencent’s value of volume traded was 6X higher than the previous record (5X for Alibaba 5X, 3X for Xiaomi, 2X for Meituan, and 2X for Kuaishou).
Southbound Stock Connect volumes were very high, with Mainland investors buying $2.88 billion of Hong Kong stocks, and Alibaba and the HK Tracker ETF were very large net buys.
Tuesday was the fourth largest net buy day ever for Southbound Stock Connect. On Monday, Mainland investors bought a net $1.4 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs via Southbound Stock Connect. Year-to-date, Mainland investors have bought nearly $24 billion worth of Hong Kong stocks and ETFs, versus $103 billion total in 2024. There have only been 17 days of +$2 billion since Connect started in November 2014.
Goldman Sachs’s well-respected portfolio strategist upgraded Hong Kong and Mainland Chins stocks on artificial intelligence momentum, emphasizing Internet stocks.
The disparity between Hong Kong and Mainland China’s equities is now nearly 15% YTD as Mainland investors continue to feel animal spirits. AI, growth, semiconductors, and technology plays were hit with profit-taking after news that Elon Musk’s xAI is updating its Grok 3 LMM. Mega-capitalization bank and energy stocks had a strong day, while the National Team’s favorite ETFs had near-average volumes, indicating there might have been some dip in buying from entities related to sovereign wealth.
Electric vehicle stocks, including CATL and BYD, which were up +0.51% and +2.22%, respectively, were another bright spot on the Mainland, as their CEOs attended the Xi meeting on an otherwise disappointing day. Ultimately, Mainland investors want to see significant policy stimulus, especially geared toward real estate. This can’t be done without a Trump trade deal. Let’s get it done.
I like to start my week with Renaissance Macro’s weekend podcast (also available on YouTube). I’ve never met Jeff De Graaf, Chairman and Head of Technical Analysis, though I followed his work during his Lehman Brothers tenure. The half-hour podcast is a concise look at the week prior and the week ahead through the facets of politics, economics, and market dynamics/technicals by De Graaf and his colleagues, economist Neil Dutta and D.C. policy expert Steve Pavlick. The Renaissance Macro team re-reiterated their positive view of Hong Kong stocks on both an absolute and relative basis. In my opinion, the podcast is a worthwhile listen.
The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes gained +1.59% and +2.54%, respectively, on volume that declined -15% from yesterday, which is 235% of the 1-year average. 251 stocks advanced, while 233 stocks declined. Main Board short turnover increased by +11.94% from yesterday, which is 288% of the 1-year average, as 19% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). The growth factor and large capitalization stocks gained more than value and small capitalization stocks. The top-performing sectors were Information Technology, up +4.67%; Communication Services, up +2.3%; and Consumer Discretionary, up +2.29%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Real Estate, which fell -0.38% and Energy, which fell -0.41%. The top-performing subsectors were technology hardware, media & entertainment, and consumer staples distribution. Meanwhile, commercial & professional services and steel were among the worst-performing subsectors. Southbound Stock Connect volumes reached 3.5x pre-stimulus levels, as Mainland investors bought a net $2.9 billion worth of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs, led by the Hong Kong Tracker ETF and Alibaba, which were large net buys, Xiaomi, which was a moderate net buy, Tencent, Semiconductor Manufacturing, and Kuaishou, which small net buys. Meanwhile, Meituan, was a moderate net sell.
Shanghai, Shenzhen, and the STAR Board fell -0.93%, -2.02%, and -2.52%, respectively, on volume down -7.36% from yesterday, which is 160% of the 1-year average. 695 stocks advanced, while 4,409 declined. Growth and large capitalization stocks “outperformed”, i.e. fell less than the value factor and small capitalization stocks. Utilities were the only positive sector, up +0.11%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Communication Services, which fell -3%; Information Technology, which fell -2.63 %; and Real Estate, which fell -2.38%. The top-performing subsectors were banking and highways. Meanwhile, education, leisure products, and web services were among the worst-performing subsectors. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were well above average. CNY and the Asia Dollar Index both fell versus the U.S. dollar. Treasury bonds fell. Copper fell while steel rose.

26,2025-02-18,"Apple is expected to announce the fourth-generation iPhone SE as soon as tomorrow, potentially with improved long-term value retention, according to analysis by SellCell.
Despite its lower price point, the ‌iPhone SE‌ has historically struggled with resale value compared to Apple's higher end smartphones. According to SellCell's depreciation analysis, previous SE models have seen significantly faster value loss than standard iPhones. The third-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ lost 42.6% of its value within the first month and 57.8% after six months, compared to the iPhone 15 lineup, which saw a decline of 28.8% in the first month and 27.8% after six months.
A similar pattern was seen with the second-generation ‌iPhone SE‌, which experienced a 50.8% drop in value within six months, whereas the iPhone 14 series saw a 31.1% decrease over the same period. This is likely due to the ‌iPhone SE‌'s lower starting price, use of older designs, and lower overall demand in the second-hand market.
However, it is worth noting that some smaller and lower-cost iPhones have managed to retain their value more effectively. For example, the ‌iPhone‌ 13 mini held its value significantly better than the SE models. The device lost only 19.2% of its value in the first month, compared to 42.6% for the third-generation SE, and after 12 months, it had depreciated by 46.1%, compared to 64.4% for the third-generation SE. Even at 24 months, the ‌iPhone‌ 13 mini had lost just 53% of its original value, positioning it closer to flagship models than to SE devices.
As the new ‌iPhone SE‌ is expected to adopt a more modern design with significantly upgraded specifications, it could potentially alter the depreciation trend that has defined previous ‌iPhone SE‌ models. The shift to an ‌iPhone‌ 14-style design could improve long-term demand, and if Apple equips it with a considerably more high-end chipset and camera system as expected, as well as Apple Intelligence support, it may retain value more effectively than its predecessors because it will remain competitive in the lineup for longer.
Like other devices, the ‌iPhone SE‌ sees continued depreciation following the launch of a successor. The second-generation SE saw an additional 4% drop in value within 12 weeks of the third-generation SE's release. They tend to see accelerated depreciation after their initial launch window, meaning those looking to upgrade should do so quickly after launch to maximize resale value.
Pricing will also be a key factor in determining the fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌'s long-term value retention. Reports suggest the device may start at up to $499 in the United States, marking a slight increase from the current model's $429 price. While this could keep the new ‌iPhone SE‌ a compelling option for budget-conscious customers, it also raises expectations for hardware improvements that justify the price increase.
Apple's decision to delay the launch of the fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ beyond its usual two-year upgrade cycle has also created a larger gap in its lineup, leaving fewer affordable options with up-to-date hardware. This may result in increased demand for the new ‌iPhone SE‌ when it launches, particularly if it offers substantial upgrades over previous models as expected.

Bill Gates says that if he were young again, he'd be afraid of more than just the atom bomb.

        ""There's, you know, about four or five things that are very scary, and the only one that I really understood and worried about a lot when I was young was nuclear war,"" Gates said in an interview with Patrick Collison.
    

        Gates, the founder of Microsoft and chair of the Gates Foundation, shared his perspective on the evolving risks facing society.
    

        ""Today I think we'd add climate change, bioterrorism/pandemic, and keeping control of AI in some form,"" Gates said. ""So, you know, now we have four footnotes."" 
    

        Gates also described social polarization as a problem, later adding, ""The younger generation has to be very afraid of those things.""
    

        This isn't the first time Gates has identified these areas of concern. In a blog post in 2023, Gates said that as his family grew, so did his desire to better the world.
    

        ""A grandchild does make you think about how we make sure the future is better — politics, health, climate, etc.,"" he wrote.
    

        Gates argued that society is suffering from a dearth of intelligence. But he believes AI could present a solution rather than a problem. Though some have warned of AI's cataclysmic potential, Gates thinks it could be harnessed productively.
    

        ""We don't have as many medical experts, you know, people who can stay on top of everything, or people who can do math tutoring in the inner city,"" Gates said. ""And we have a shortage of intelligence, and so we use this market system to kind of allocate it. AI, over time — and people can argue about the time frames — will make intelligence essentially free.""
    

        Despite the challenges, Gates said he still expects the citizens of the future to be largely better off — if they address the risks.
    

        ""Absent not solving some of these big problems, things are going to be so much better off,"" Gates said. ""Alzheimer's, obesity, you know, we'll have a cure for HIV, we will have gotten rid of polio, measles, malaria. The pace of innovation is greater today than ever.""
    

        While fear can often act as a paralytic, Gates believes it could be a galvanizing force for younger generations.
    

        ""They'll actually, to some degree, exaggerate the likelihood and maybe the impact of some of those things in order to activate people to make sure we steer clear of those things,"" he said.

31,2025-02-18,"The Trump administration is planning to lay off at least 40% of the Federal Housing Administration’s (FHA) workers, according to a Bloomberg report. 
The FHA is just the latest target of the Trump administration’s  Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
The FHA provides mortgage insurance on loans for people who otherwise wouldn’t qualify for one because of low credit scores or insufficient income. The cuts could have ripple effects for homebuyers hoping to jump into an already soft real estate market, according to experts.
Levi Rodgers, owner of the VA Loan Network, which specializes in loans for veterans, thinks the purge could put a chill on an already frosty market. Interest rates hovering near 7 percent in recent months have dampened demand among buyers.
“Layoffs of this scale could trigger automatic processing delays, and FHA closing times and applications could take longer,” Rodgers says.  Conventional loans could benefit because sellers could begin choosing conventional financing for its faster turnaround.
But a hollowed-out FHA could impact marginal borrowers the most, Rodgers says.
“With fewer underwriters, more stringent lending requirements also are on the table, and marginal-qualified consumers could be required to have higher credit ratings or more savings for approval,” Rodgers says.
In addition to impacting marginal borrowers,  Rodgers says, newer FHA products such as down payment subsidies or simplified refinancing could take more time to implement, leaving some future homeowners with more costly alternatives.
“This staff reduction brings a degree of uncertainty into the mix and could complicate securing FHA-backed financing for those relying on the program,” Rodgers says.
Luke Siegel, founder and CEO of residential door company Raydoor, fears the impact on demand will be significant.
“I could see these delays heavily impacting demand, specifically for entry-level homes,” Siegel says, adding that if FHA loans take longer to process or become more difficult to obtain, many buyers are going to be forced to explore alternative financing.
“On top of that, sellers relying on FHA-backed buyers may face prolonged closing timelines, potentially leading to pricing adjustments or increased competition from buyers with conventional financing,” Siegel says, noting that it’s too early to assess the full impact.
“Homebuyers should absolutely be prepared for slowdowns in the process and I would recommend them to work closely with lenders to explore financing options,” Siegel says.

Value stocks have had a difficult time over the last few years, but things could be looking up, especially for investors who seek out lesser-known names.
In recent interviews with me, Jim Zimmerman, Abigail Zimmerman, and Ara Laterovian with Lowell Capital, and Ted Rosenthal with TMR Capital each shared their two top under-the-radar stock picks. Lowell Capital chose Macfarlane Group and Academy Sports and Outdoors, while Rosenthal selected REV Group and Celestica.
Macfarlane Group is the leading specialist distributor of protective packaging materials in the U.K. It operates in the U.K., Ireland, the Netherlands and Germany, providing industrial and retail customers with a wide range of protective packaging materials.
The Lowell Capital team was initially drawn to Macfarlane Group’s “highly cash-generative business model, ‘Ft. Knox’ balance sheet, sustainable and resilient business model, entrenched customer relationships, high ROIC business model, non-capital intensive business, disciplined management team, and long-term growth path.”
The Lowell team highlighted Macfarlane’s resilient business model, reporting that it consistently passes along raw material pricing changes to customers. As a result, management focuses more on gross profits than top-line revenues. They believe it’s largely due to high switching costs among customers.
Macfarlane Group has also gone through a successful turnaround and growth strategy under CEO Peter Atkinson.
“We believe MACF can drive sales growth through accretive acquisitions alongside modest organic growth,” the Lowell team said. “We believe MACF’s highly cash-generative and high-ROIC business model can grow adjusted EBITDA from £36 million in 2023 to £45 million by 2027 with zero net debt and trade for 8x adjusted EBITDA for a market cap and enterprise value of £360 million.”
They estimate that Macfarlane Group could be worth £2.25 per share, versus its current price of around £1.12 a share. Additionally, the Lowell Capital team believes the company could be an attractive M&A target.
Academy and Sports Outdoors is a sporting and outdoor recreational retailer in the U.S., operating 282 stores across 18 states. The company is the second-largest sporting goods retailer in the country.
The Lowell team was initially drawn to Academy and Sports Outdoors for its high cash generation, low cash flow multiple, strong balance sheet and strong growth prospects. They highlighted several characteristics that they like, including a highly resilient business model, a cash-generative business, and a strong focus on value-added services.
The Lowell team also likes its attractive valuation at less than 5x adjusted EBITDA and high single-digit free cash flow yield, its record of strong sales and profit growth, its disciplined management plan and “Ft. Knox” balance sheet with net debt of about $100 million, its long-term strategy to grow sales to $10 billion and net income margin to 10% by 2028, and its high-ROIC business model with limited capital requirements.
REV Group designs, manufactures and distributes specialty vehicles like fire and emergency vehicles, commercial vehicles, RVs, and related aftermarket parts and services. The company is the result of several bolt-on acquisitions between 2006 and 2020 and was founded by private equity firm American Industrial Partners.
Rosenthal was initially drawn to REV Group as a short position because he suspected it might be overearning. However, he switched his thesis from short to long because record backlog growth quickly drove large price increases that haven’t yet appeared in the company’s financials.
“As throughput and margins normalize in Specialty Vehicles, and as business rebounds in RVs (from depressed levels), EBITDA margins should expand to 11% by 2026,” Rosenthal explained. “Ten times normalized 2026 EBITDA results in 144% upside for a 49% IRR.”
He added that REV Group enjoys a high and growing market share in an attractive oligopoly industry for its Specialty Vehicles segment, while Fire and Emergency demand tends to be stable because it’s driven by replacement cycles. Prices in F&E have risen 3% over the last few decades with no down years, and the industry has consolidated, leading to record-high backlogs and improved pricing power.
“Business quality is also decent,” Rosenthal pointed out. “There is a lot of customization/ value add, variable cost structure, low maintenance capex, structural ability to drive attractive levels of return on invested capital, and strong revenue visibility in certain product categories with longer backlogs.
Celestica is a leading electronics manufacturing services (EMS) and outsourced manufacturer that manages global networks capable of delivering customized supply chain solutions. Rosenthal was initially drawn to the stock because he was seeking a value-oriented way to gain exposure to artificial intelligence.
He feels Celestica is an underappreciated AI play, noting that it’s trading at around 20x P/E. He estimates 12x 2026 EBITDA for 83% upside and a 22% investment rate on return.
“CLS has historically been a decent business but always traded at a low valuation multiple because of its low margins and difficulty in predicting the business’ financials,” Rosenthal explained. “EMS businesses operate in a competitive industry (more so with consumer electronics, where CLS has minimal exposure) with very thin operating margins, are subject to the performance of their end markets, and there is very little visibility beyond the next quarter.”
Market breadth increased toward the end of 2024, giving many value stocks a boost versus their growth counterparts. However, according to BlackRock, many investors have had limited exposure to value because it’s just a small portion of the market indexes.
As a result, it might take a bit of a deeper dive to gain access to this segment of the market, either through value indexes like the SPDR S&P 500 Value ETF or similar actively managed funds. However, investors who are prepared for value to make a comeback will be better positioned for when it happens, like during late 2024.
It’s anyone’s guess whether value will continue to hold on in 2025, but so far, things are looking up. The SPDR Value ETF is holding its own against the growth-oriented S&P 500, with both up more than 3% year to date. At this point, it looks like we’re in a holding pattern between growth and value, making it a good time to hold exposures to both."
33,2025-02-18,"Nvidia (NVDA-0.20%) stock extended its rally into a third day, rising more than 1% on Tuesday. The AI chipmaker’s shares have now regained about 90% of the ground they lost in panic-selling last month triggered by Chinese startup DeepSeek. At about $140 per share, Nvidia stock is still below its 2025 peak of $153.13, set on Jan. 7.
Despite DeepSeek’s claims of lower costs to develop AI, new spending plans have since been unveiled worldwide, MarketWatch (NWSA+1.37%) reports, citing Bank of America Securities (BAC-1.12%) analyst Vivek Arya. These include a European Commission plan to mobilize €200 billion for investment, including a €20 billion fund for AI gigafactories.
South Korea will buy 10,000 high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) this year, including Nvidia’s H100 and H200 models, to accelerate the launch of a national AI computing center, Yonhap reported Monday, citing Acting President Choi Sang-mok.
And given strong demand, pricing for Nvidia’s existing chips may remain resilient despite the company’s transition to its new Blackwell technology, Barron’s reports, citing a note from UBS (UBS-1.53%) analyst Timothy Arcuri.
Nvidia stock fell by more than 17% in just one trading day in January amid a global sell-off of tech stocks sparked by the release of China’s DeepSeek-R1 reasoning models last week. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang saw his net worth plunge by $18 billion as a result of the stock rout. The selloff was so pronounced that Nvidia did unusual damage control.
“DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling,” a company spokesperson said in a statement at the time. “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.”

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Claire Georges, CEO of Butterfly Bakery, a seed-to-shelf natural foods producer in Vermont. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.

        I started Butterfly Bakery in 2003 as a tiny natural foods bakery with just me baking in the middle of the night while I had a full time job.
    

        For the last 10 years, we've been selling hot sauce made with locally sourced ingredients.
    

        We even started developing a really great relationship with Heatonist, who went on to manage ""Hot Ones"" and their sauces. Then the pandemic happened, and hot sauce just really exploded.
    

        Now hot sauce is the majority of what we do.
    

        80% of our ingredients by weight are sourced directly from small farms. The ingredients that aren't are things like vinegar and salt.
    

        We call it seed to shelf.
    

        We're about as local as a business can get, but we still operate and live in this global society and global marketplace. We get our heating fuel from Canada, and a majority of our glass comes from China.
    

        There are two primary manufacturers of our main five-ounce hot sauce bottle: one in China and one in New Jersey.
    

        When I first heard that there was a New Jersey option, I was like, ""Oh, fantastic! That fits in with everything we do in terms of sourcing.""
    

        It's more expensive, but so are our chili peppers.
    

        We started buying them, and, unfortunately, the quality was really awful. Part of the issue was that they would explode in my staff's hands. They were not tempered properly, so when we would fill it with something hot, the glass would explode.
    

        It would make a huge mess and the entire production had to stop to make sure there's no glass getting in the product. We'd have to throw out sauce that was nearby and start over again.
    

        Not only was that really frustrating, but these US bottles were about 10 to 20 cents more expensive, which is a lot when you're talking about Chinese ones that cost about 35 cents each.
    

        We now use the bottles from China, and back in November we did a whole truckload so that we could stock up to get ahead of any new tariffs.
    

        Fitting in that truckload was an adventure. We were moving things out of every nook and cranny, and everybody just got really cozy with all the glass bottles for a little while, until we got through most of them.
    

        It quickly became clear that if these tariffs were going to last four years, we definitely can't buy four years' worth of worth of glass because there's nowhere to put it.
    

        We've been in business for 20 years now, and you just kind of take your lumps, keep going, and figure it out.
    

        I'm paying about 35 cents for a bottle, and that's varied widely. A 10% tariff means I pay about three to four cents more.
    

        That doesn't sound like a lot on a $9 bottle of hot sauce, but we're usually buying up to $30,000 worth of glass at a time. Now that $30,000 order becomes a $33,000 order — what else as a business could we do with that $3,000?
    

        More than the tariffs on Chinese goods, I'm most apprehensive about potentially higher costs of fuel from Canada.
    

        We're paying between $4,000 and $6,000 in fuel costs for heating and running our equipment, so that's an extra $400 to $600 every single month that we would need to pay.
    

        During the pandemic, I felt like government leaders were trying to help small businesses out. These tariffs feel like the opposite of that.
    

        I don't think tariffs as a whole are bad. I think they just need to have a reason and a benefit.
    

        I am committed to local for the good that it does, but I'm not an isolationist.
    

        For example, there was a store near here that attempted to survive for a couple of years, and they were hyper-hyperlocal — literally everything had to either be made locally or grown locally, with no exceptions.
    

        What it meant was that their deli sandwiches had no mayonnaise on them, because nobody made mayonnaise locally — mayonnaise has oil in it, and nobody was locally growing oil crops.
    

        As a result, nobody wanted to buy the sandwiches, because people want mayonnaise on their sandwiches.
    

        In other words, even local businesses can still benefit from the global economy.
    

        I don't think closing out other people benefits anybody.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Regina Lawless, author of ""Do You."" It has been edited for length and clarity.

        I was in corporate America for 20 years, and for about the past decade, my work was focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion. I worked for many global firms, but my most prestigious role was as the DEI lead for Instagram, from 2020 until 2023.
    

        Since I was the first DEI leader at the company, my first goal was to establish some goals. I really delved into Instagram's demographic makeup so we could understand how that compares to the demographic makeup of the general population. We collected data on any demographic you can imagine, including gender, race, ethnic background, and age. That way, we knew which groups were overrepresented or underrepresented.
    

        With that data, I could see that women were underrepresented, especially in leadership at Instagram. Women make up about half the country's population, so you'd expect them to make up half of leadership, but only about 30% of leadership at the company was female. We made some progress on that during the tenure, using mentorship programs and other tools.
    

People get quite a bit wrong about DEI. But the most fundamental misunderstanding is the idea that DEI programs put people who aren't qualified into positions. That's a huge mischaracterization.
    

        DEI work means ensuring that everyone who is qualified has a fair shot at a role. We know that's often not the case. Opening the door to more people often means reexamining the hiring process. If you hire internally, but your team is mostly men, you're more likely to hire a man. If you ask for referrals, you only find people with connections. If you screen for candidates with Ivy League educations, you leave other perfectly qualified people out.
    

        Another misconception is that DEI takes jobs away from qualified people. That couldn't be further from the truth. Instead, it's about opening up job opportunities to more people who have worked just as hard — maybe harder — but don't yet have a foot in the door.
    

        Despite the current environment, I think DEI is here to stay. Fundamentally, teams are more creative and innovative when they're composed of people from varied backgrounds and experiences. That's better for business.
    

        As Gen Z and eventually Gen Alpha enter the workforce, I think inclusion will be the natural way we do business. We might not call it DEI or assign one person the impossible job of ensuring equity, but there will be a culture of honoring people's differences and the strengths they bring.
    

        In 2021, I lost my husband unexpectedly to a heart attack. I was 40, and he was only 45. His death caused me to fundamentally rethink my outlook on life. My corporate work didn't feel as fulfilling. It didn't give me the freedom and flexibility I needed, especially now that I was a single mom to our son, who was 15.
    

        Leaving Instagram was scary. I was making multiple six-figures and regularly received stock options that vested quarterly. I had recently bought a home and still had a mortgage. I had a good income but didn't have the type of wealth that meant I could retire.
    

        I worked with my financial planner to bolster savings and diversify my investments. She advised me to keep working a while longer, but ultimately, I left sooner than she thought I should. I had to follow my heart.
    

        Now, I'm an author, content creator, and coach. In my first year of self-employment, I made about a quarter of what I was making in my corporate role. I had to adjust to getting paid monthly or less often rather than every two weeks. My cash flow was very different from what I was used to.
    

        Since then, I've grown my business. I haven't yet matched what I made in my corporate role, but I'm confident I will soon. The creative freedom and creativity in my work today feel priceless — well worth the sacrifice of a title and salary.
    

        Throughout the past five years, I've realized that success means knowing who you are and living in alignment with that. I've done that through five steps. I reconnected with my heart, finding my desire for more creativity; I restored my body through yoga; reframed my beliefs and ditched self-limiting stories; renewed my spirit by finding joy again; and reinvented routines, making sure all this personal growth sticks.

39,2025-02-18,"Looking for to take your astrophotography to the next level? Save up to $800 on the Nikon Z8, a powerhouse of a mirrorless camera just in time to capture March's lunar eclipse.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Are you a pro photographer or an enthusiastic amateur looking to take your camera work to the next level? Then now's the time to take the plunge, because this Nikon Z8, an absolute powerhouse of a mirrorless camera, is up to $800 off.
You can get the Nikon Z8 and 24-120mm f/4 lens bundle on sale right now at B&H Photo for $4297 or the Nikon Z8 body only for $3397 at Amazon.
The Nikon Z8 camera is a top-tier camera, designed for pros, and it's an absolute steal at $800 off with a lens or $700 off without. We think it's the best mirrorless camera on the market and the best mirrorless camera for astrophotography, making it ideal for capturing spectacular images of the lunar eclipse in March.
This is the cheapest the camera has ever been, too, beating even its Black Friday and holiday season prices. But you'll have to move fast, stock of the body-only Nikon Z8 is seriously limited.
Save $603 on the Nikon Z8, the best mirrorless camera on the market and the best mirrorless camera for astrophotography. This is a pro-level camera that should be with you for years and this is the cheapest it's ever been. You'll need to provide your own lens and while stock is limited at Amazon it's also the same price at Adorama and B+H Photo.

Alternatively, save $800 on the Nikon Z8 with a Nikkor 24-120mm f/4 lens, the perfect pairing. We awarded it a massive five stars in our Nikon Z8 review and, again, this beats even Black Friday's price. 
Whether you're a serious photographer, shooting for business, or just an enthusiastic amateur, this Nikon Z8 is an absolute steal at $800 off with a lens or $700 without. You're actually saving more on the bundle too, since the Nikkor 24-120mm f/4 lens, a seriously capable lens, often sells for $1,000 on its own.
This is a camera that will stay with you for years. In our Nikon Z8 review, we awarded it a massive 5 out of 5 stars. It boasts super noise handling, fantastically detailed photos and videos (including 60FPS 8K video), an astonishing 120fps burst speed and superb autofocus detection.
Despite all that functionality, it's easy enough to use. Its buttons are sensibly placed and once you get to grips with it, you'll never want to put it down. Our only real criticism was the price tag, but at $800 this deal is hard to beat. If it does sell out at Amazon, the body-only Nikon Z8 is also the same price at Adorama and B+H Photo.
Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!
Key features: Full-frame 45.7MP sensor, Nikon Z lens mount, ISO range of 64-25,600 (expandable to 102,400), video at 8K 60p 12-bit, single SD UHS-II and single CFexpress/XQD memory card slots

Price history: The body and lens bundle was reduced by $700 last Black Friday but this is an even bigger saving. Both the Z8 and the Z8 with lens are the same price at Adorama, Amazon and B&H Photo.
Bundle price comparison: Amazon: $4,297 | B&H Photo: $4,297 | Adorama: $4,297
Reviews consensus: In our Nikon Z8 review we awarded it 5 out of 5 stars, stating that it was ""..the go-to camera for professionals and enthusiastic amateurs with the budget."" We think it's the best mirrorless camera on the market and the best mirrorless camera for astrophotograph and its Amazon reviews are every bit as effusive.

41,2025-02-18,"Super Micro Computer  (SMCI+5.44%) continued its strong rally a week after reporting impressive earnings, even as U.S. stocks remained relatively stable overall on Tuesday following the long weekend. 
Shares of the AI hardware company surged 13% on Tuesday, trading at $53 a piece. The sustained momentum comes as Super Micro’s latest earnings report reassured investors about its delayed annual filing and outlined an ambitious growth target for 2026.
Super Micro is working to avoid delisting by Nasdaq, with a deadline of February 25 to submit its delayed annual report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). CEO Charles Liang seemed confident that it would be submitted on time. 
Since last week, investors have been bullish about SMCI’s performance. In its earnings report, the company expects to reach $40 billion in revenue by fiscal 2026, while analysts anticipated $30 billion for that period.
Last week, banking giant JPMorgan (JPM-0.01%) analysts raised the SMCI stock price target to $35 from $23 while keeping an ‘underweight’ rating. SMCI stock has risen 80% year-to-date.
Super Micro makes hardware that supports AI applications. Last year, the San-Jose-based company went through many ups and downs.
The SMCI stock thrived for much of 2024 and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498 as part of a frenzy over AI and related tools.
As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA-0.20%) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates the technology into its servers to support AI workloads. Super Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship.
Super Micro Computer went through a rough phase in September 2024 when a short seller, Hindenburg Research, published a scathing report accusing the company of accounting red flags and questionable business dealings, including alleged sanctions evasion from exports to Russian and Chinese firms. Following that, its auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned, citing disagreement over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence.

But a flurry of innovation from cybercrime groups in China is breathing new life into the carding industry, by turning phished card data into mobile wallets that can be used online and at main street stores.
An image from one Chinese phishing group’s Telegram channel shows various toll road phish kits available.
If you own a mobile phone, the chances are excellent that at some point in the past two years it has received at least one phishing message that spoofs the U.S. Postal Service to supposedly collect some outstanding delivery fee, or an SMS that pretends to be a local toll road operator warning of a delinquent toll fee.
These messages are being sent through sophisticated phishing kits sold by several cybercriminals based in mainland China. And they are not traditional SMS phishing or “smishing” messages, as they bypass the mobile networks entirely. Rather, the missives are sent through the Apple iMessage service and through RCS, the functionally equivalent technology on Google phones.
People who enter their payment card data at one of these sites will be told their financial institution needs to verify the small transaction by sending a one-time passcode to the customer’s mobile device. In reality, that code will be sent by the victim’s financial institution to verify that the user indeed wishes to link their card information to a mobile wallet.
If the victim then provides that one-time code, the phishers will link the card data to a new mobile wallet from Apple or Google, loading the wallet onto a mobile phone that the scammers control.
Ford Merrill works in security research at SecAlliance, a CSIS Security Group company. Merrill has been studying the evolution of several China-based smishing gangs, and found that most of them feature helpful and informative video tutorials in their sales accounts on Telegram. Those videos show the thieves are loading multiple stolen digital wallets on a single mobile device, and then selling those phones in bulk for hundreds of dollars apiece.
“Who says carding is dead?,” said Merrill, who presented about his findings at the M3AAWG security conference in Lisbon earlier today. “This is the best mag stripe cloning device ever. This threat actor is saying you need to buy at least 10 phones, and they’ll air ship them to you.”
One promotional video shows stacks of milk crates stuffed full of phones for sale. A closer inspection reveals that each phone is affixed with a handwritten notation that typically references the date its mobile wallets were added, the number of wallets on the device, and the initials of the seller.
An image from the Telegram channel for a popular Chinese smishing kit vendor shows 10 mobile phones for sale, each loaded with 4-6 digital wallets from different UK financial institutions.
Merrill said one common way criminal groups in China are cashing out with these stolen mobile wallets involves setting up fake e-commerce businesses on Stripe or Zelle and running transactions through those entities — often for amounts totaling between $100 and $500.
Merrill said that when these phishing groups first began operating in earnest two years ago, they would wait between 60 to 90 days before selling the phones or using them for fraud. But these days that waiting period is more like just seven to ten days, he said.
“When they first installed this, the actors were very patient,” he said. “Nowadays, they only wait like 10 days before [the wallets] are hit hard and fast.”
Criminals also can cash out mobile wallets by obtaining real point-of-sale terminals and using tap-to-pay on phone after phone. But they also offer a more cutting-edge mobile fraud technology: Merrill found that at least one of the Chinese phishing groups sells an Android app called “ZNFC” that can relay a valid NFC transaction to anywhere in the world. The user simply waves their phone at a local payment terminal that accepts Apple or Google pay, and the app relays an NFC transaction over the Internet from a phone in China.
“The software can work from anywhere in the world,” Merrill said. “These guys provide the software for $500 a month, and it can relay both NFC enabled tap-to-pay as well as any digital wallet. The even have 24-hour support.”
The rise of so-called “ghost tap” mobile software was first documented in November 2024 by security experts at ThreatFabric. Andy Chandler, the company’s chief commercial officer, said their researchers have since identified a number of criminal groups from different regions of the world latching on to this scheme.
Chandler said those include organized crime gangs in Europe that are using similar mobile wallet and NFC attacks to take money out of ATMs made to work with smartphones.
“No one is talking about it, but we’re now seeing ten different methodologies using the same modus operandi, and none of them are doing it the same,” Chandler said. “This is much bigger than the banks are prepared to say.”
A November 2024 story in the Singapore daily The Straits Times reported authorities there arrested three foreign men who were recruited in their home countries via social messaging platforms, and given ghost tap apps with which to purchase expensive items from retailers, including mobile phones, jewelry, and gold bars.
“Since Nov 4, at least 10 victims who had fallen for e-commerce scams have reported unauthorised transactions totaling more than $100,000 on their credit cards for purchases such as electronic products, like iPhones and chargers, and jewelry in Singapore,” The Straits Times wrote, noting that in another case with a similar modus operandi, the police arrested a Malaysian man and woman on Nov 8.

According to Merrill, the phishing pages that spoof the USPS and various toll road operators are powered by several innovations designed to maximize the extraction of victim data.
For example, a would-be smishing victim might enter their personal and financial information, but then decide the whole thing is scam before actually submitting the data. In this case, anything typed into the data fields of the phishing page will be captured in real time, regardless of whether the visitor actually clicks the “submit” button.
Merrill said people who submit payment card data to these phishing sites often are then told their card can’t be processed, and urged to use a different card. This technique, he said, sometimes allows the phishers to steal more than one mobile wallet per victim.
Many phishing websites expose victim data by storing the stolen information directly on the phishing domain. But Merrill said these Chinese phishing kits will forward all victim data to a back-end database operated by the phishing kit vendors. That way, even when the smishing sites get taken down for fraud, the stolen data is still safe and secure.
Another important innovation is the use of mass-created Apple and Google user accounts through which these phishers send their spam messages. One of the Chinese phishing groups posted images on their Telegram sales channels showing how these robot Apple and Google accounts are loaded onto Apple and Google phones, and arranged snugly next to each other in an expansive, multi-tiered rack that sits directly in front of the phishing service operator.
The ashtray says: You’ve been phishing all night.
In other words, the smishing websites are powered by real human operators as long as new messages are being sent. Merrill said the criminals appear to send only a few dozen messages at a time, likely because completing the scam takes manual work by the human operators in China. After all, most one-time codes used for mobile wallet provisioning are generally only good for a few minutes before they expire.
Notably, none of the phishing sites spoofing the toll operators or postal services will load in a regular Web browser; they will only render if they detect that a visitor is coming from a mobile device.
“One of the reasons they want you to be on a mobile device is they want you to be on the same device that is going to receive the one-time code,” Merrill said. “They also want to minimize the chances you will leave. And if they want to get that mobile tokenization and grab your one-time code, they need a live operator.”
Merrill found the Chinese phishing kits feature another innovation that makes it simple for customers to turn stolen card details into a mobile wallet: They programmatically take the card data supplied by the phishing victim and convert it into a digital image of a real payment card that matches that victim’s financial institution. That way, attempting to enroll a stolen card into Apple Pay, for example, becomes as easy as scanning the fabricated card image with an iPhone.

“The phone isn’t smart enough to know whether it’s a real card or just an image,” Merrill said. “So it scans the card into Apple Pay, which says okay we need to verify that you’re the owner of the card by sending a one-time code.”
How profitable are these mobile phishing kits? The best guess so far comes from data gathered by other security researchers who’ve been tracking these advanced Chinese phishing vendors.
In August 2023, the security firm Resecurity discovered a vulnerability in one popular Chinese phish kit vendor’s platform that exposed the personal and financial data of phishing victims. Resecurity dubbed the group the Smishing Triad, and found the gang had harvested 108,044 payment cards across 31 phishing domains (3,485 cards per domain).
In August 2024, security researcher Grant Smith gave a presentation at the DEFCON security conference about tracking down the Smishing Triad after scammers spoofing the U.S. Postal Service duped his wife. By identifying a different vulnerability in the gang’s phishing kit, Smith said he was able to see that people entered 438,669 unique credit cards in 1,133 phishing domains (387 cards per domain).
Based on his research, Merrill said it’s reasonable to expect between $100 and $500 in losses on each card that is turned into a mobile wallet. Merrill said they observed nearly 33,000 unique domains tied to these Chinese smishing groups during the year between the publication of Resecurity’s research and Smith’s DEFCON talk.
Using a median number of 1,935 cards per domain and a conservative loss of $250 per card, that comes out to about $15 billion in fraudulent charges over a year.
Merrill was reluctant to say whether he’d identified additional security vulnerabilities in any of the phishing kits sold by the Chinese groups, noting that the phishers quickly fixed the vulnerabilities that were detailed publicly by Resecurity and Smith.
Adoption of touchless payments took off in the United States after the Coronavirus pandemic emerged, and many financial institutions in the United States were eager to make it simple for customers to link payment cards to mobile wallets. Thus, the authentication requirement for doing so defaulted to sending the customer a one-time code via SMS.
Experts say the continued reliance on one-time codes for onboarding mobile wallets has fostered this new wave of carding. KrebsOnSecurity interviewed a security executive from a large European financial institution who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.
That expert said the lag between the phishing of victim card data and its eventual use for fraud has left many financial institutions struggling to correlate the causes of their losses.
“That’s part of why the industry as a whole has been caught by surprise,” the expert said. “A lot of people are asking, how this is possible now that we’ve tokenized a plaintext process. We’ve never seen the volume of sending and people responding that we’re seeing with these phishers.”
To improve the security of digital wallet provisioning, some banks in Europe and Asia require customers to log in to the bank’s mobile app before they can link a digital wallet to their device.
Addressing the ghost tap threat may require updates to contactless payment terminals, to better identify NFC transactions that are being relayed from another device. But experts say it’s unrealistic to expect retailers will be eager to replace existing payment terminals before their expected lifespans expire.
And of course Apple and Google have an increased role to play as well, given that their accounts are being created en masse and used to blast out these smishing messages. Both companies could easily tell which of their devices suddenly have 7-10 different mobile wallets added from 7-10 different people around the world. They could also recommend that financial institutions use more secure authentication methods for mobile wallet provisioning.
Neither Apple nor Google responded to requests for comment on this story.

Sounds like if person has no digital wallet = safe from this scam.
I suspect they can make wallets as a victim with just a card by setting up a new phone account as them. :/
I didn’t get that from the article.  The attacker is the one setting up the wallet and linking it to the card.  They are triggering 2-factor and the victim gets a message and provides the 2nd factor for the attacker to link the card to the attacker’s wallet.
Not so much – the bad guys will still go after your CC details to use in card not present fraud transactions.  This is no different than other scams that have been around forever going for CNP fraud.  The wallet stuffing is brilliant and their preferred outcome, but they’ll take anything they can get and monetize it.
One more reason I’m glad I only use a basic “flip phone”. Someday, I may get the rotary dial one!
Least base r/dumbphone user.
Nice touch with the Wilco reference:)
I’m glad someone got that!
Great article and good insights on how this is being done, and what people should look out for. However, I don’t get why the obvious smear campaign against Telegram (mentioned *5 times* in this article and captions), it’s just a great tool bad folks are abusing. But you paint it to your readers as if Telegram is somehow complicit in this fraud. Not cool.
Because they are complicit. Telegram is the biggest trash fire on earth. It enables so much criminal behavior and everyone with common sense knows it. Just because you can use it for non-crime stuff doesn’t mean it excuses the terrible and illegal abhorrent behavior on the platform. The reason they arrested Durov was because he didn’t co-operate with authorities, but I guess the threat of prison and bunking with Bubba changes your mind.
Gotta agree with Dave, here. Telegram is a cesspool. Best phrase I’ve heard is it’s like having the dark web in your pocket. But you would have to be insane as a security person and install Telegram on any mobile device you care about. You don’t have to go looking for trouble on Telegram, because it will find you just fine.
Hang on, Brian. Are you saying that even installing Telegram on your smartphone is bad. Can you explain?
In one way, financial institutions brought this onto themselves.  They KNEW that SMS isn’t sufficiently secure.  But they don’t care.  My banks – Capital One and Citi –  both provide no way to add either a hardware or software authenticator.  Only SMS verification.  Nothing is totally foolproof, but linking a card to one’s phone would be much more secure if authenticator codes are used – rather than SMS codes.
Wouldn’t it help to just change the SMS text to something like this:
“You are about to link your Citi bank account with Apple Pay. Use code 149382 to continue.”
I know many companies don’t get that right (I’ve gotten so many OTP codes without any context information in the SMS text). And it also won’t provide full protection since quite some users just copy the code without reading the text – but at least it gives users another chance to detect the phishing and would make it less likely to succeed.
We saw this trend about 1-2 months ago, reported it up to our card vendor and started looking in to ways to reduce the risk, engaged our digital banking provider, etc..  Key as we see it is that we need to tie both the tokenization of the card AND the step up MFA method to the device that is requesting the tokenization, via as many means capable (geolocation, IMEI, etc..).   Oh, and convincing the industry players this needs to be a requirement.  IMHO it is a break in the PCI protection model, enough of a process is granted to “produce a card” but the boundary of protection to produce a card is extended way too far.  Imagine if the process of instant issue is extended to any card printer on the planet, instead of the one in a locked and controlled area with a HSM server and etc..  This is effectively what is currently being permitted.  Really needs to be buttoned down.
I appreciated the Wilco lyric quote, and the article. Thanks!
Several of the “innovations” listed in this article are decades-old techniques. 
Multiple decades old: mass-creation of accounts, storing web data in a “back-end” database, sending form input as it is typed. 
At least a decade old: Using a large rack of mobile devices to commit fraud.
Using a generated image of a credit card to make it easier to scan with a wallet app I guess could count as an innovation, but not a very impressive one.
What is also semi-recent is the ability to e.g. share your wallet with friends and family.  Thus the ability to spread the card as desired, once in the wallet.
I was seeing fraud purchases with synthesised card (and ID) images 15 years ago. The only novel thing here is the NFC relaying.
Thank you , Brian for posting this. The video was a shocker to me. It answered the question which I was looking for last 2 years. Contactless transaction from two countries located in different continents with in short time !!
It appears at least one of the phishing kits did not require mobile; after several minutes of trying to convince family member this was not from USPS (along with discussing how much USPS really cares ? 🙂 and/or even knows your cell number ), logged into urlscan.io with the link, saw a very convincing USPS webpage [I was not on a mobile device although I guess sometimes Chromebooks present as Android ? ]

Why So Many Top Hackers Hail from Russia"

46,2025-02-18,"Tesla (TSLA+1.52%) has begun hiring staff in India after CEO Elon Musk met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, potentially putting an end to the company’s delayed entry into the market. 
Although just 13 jobs were posted on Tesla’s LinkedIn, each of which is located in Mumbai’s metropolitan region, the development is enough to raise investors’ hopes. “The Tesla community has been waiting years for the company to enter India, and now it’s finally happening,” wrote prominent Tesla influencer Sawyer Merritt on X. 
Musk had talked about entering India as far back as 2019, promising on multiple occasions to try and get into the market. In 2021, Tesla incorporated an affiliate — Tesla India Motors and Energy — but plans to sell its electric vehicles in India were put on hold a year later.
One of the major reasons behind that delay was India’s protectionist tariffs on imports of foreign electric vehicles, Musk has said. India levies taxes of 70% or even 100% on imported EVs, depending on their value. 
 Despite Tesla’s lobbying efforts, local manufacturers opposed changes for years, although India’s federal government in 2024 announced that some companies would be able to pay lower rates under certain conditions. Firms that commit to investing at least $500 million and begin domestic manufacturing within three years are able to import up to 8,000 EVs each year at a 15% tax rate. 
About a month after India announced the new rates, Musk was supposed to meet with Modi in the country, before canceling and heading to China instead. Their meeting last week — where they discussed space exploration, artificial intelligence, and emerging technologies — was the first since 2023, when Musk said he was confident Tesla would enter India “as soon as humanly possible.”
Musk’s SpaceX has also been interested in entering India, where it is currently not legally allowed to operate its Starlink service and has a license application under review. The CEO has wanted to enter the market since 2021, but was halted by regulatory issues.

47,2025-02-18,"The cryptocurrency market has fundamentally transformed our perception of money. Is crypto a currency, like the dollar? A commodity, like gold? Or an asset, like stocks? Its unique characteristics blur traditional classifications, making it a versatile financial instrument.
Thanks to its adaptability, cryptocurrency has reshaped the global financial landscape, offering a wide range of use cases. Let’s explore them.
2 / 7
In today’s digital world, cross-border transactions are common but often come with challenges such as slow processing, high fees, and a lack of transparency. Payments typically rely on banks, remittance centers, and credit card networks, adding complexity and delays.
Blockchain technology simplifies this process, enabling businesses and individuals to transfer funds faster and at lower costs. Transactions are nearly instant and unrestricted by bank holidays, weekends, or business hours, allowing seamless global payments.
3 / 7
Blockchain functions as a distributed ledger, recording transactions in a verifiable and traceable manner. Everyone in the network can access transaction details and history, enhancing transparency and accountability. This powerful feature has revolutionized the financial world, fostering greater trust and openness in financial transactions.
4 / 7
Cryptocurrency has fundamentally reshaped our understanding of money and its management, operating outside the control of traditional authorities like governments and central banks. Unlike fiat currencies, where monetary policy is regulated through mechanisms such as increasing or decreasing the money supply through interest rates, crypto follows a decentralized approach to managing its circulation.
One key method is token burning, where a portion of cryptocurrency is permanently removed from circulation by sending it to an inaccessible or untraceable wallet. This reduction in supply can create scarcity, potentially increasing the asset’s value over time. By leveraging such mechanisms, cryptocurrencies establish their own economic models independent of centralized financial institutions.
5 / 7
Despite the global presence of banks, a significant portion of the population remains unbanked, lacking access to even a basic savings account. As of 2023, the World Bank estimates that 1.4 billion people worldwide are unbanked, meaning they do not hold an account with a traditional financial institution.
In such circumstances, cryptocurrencies offer a viable digital alternative, enabling individuals to access financial services without dependence on banks or government-backed systems. For example, in Africa, the digital payment platform BitPesa leverages Bitcoin to streamline cross-border payments, showcasing the potential of crypto to drive financial inclusion. This growing adoption has fueled Africa’s cryptocurrency market, which has expanded by billions of dollars, according to the World Economic Forum.

One of the standout features of blockchain technology is its ability to securely record data that cannot be altered. This immutability proves invaluable in supply-chain management. As businesses expand globally, ensuring transparency from the source to the end consumer becomes increasingly crucial. Blockchain enables manufacturers to create and maintain reliable, traceable records of material movements throughout the supply chain.
Retail giant Walmart, for example, leverages blockchain technology to address food supply-chain challenges. This allows the company to efficiently track products and streamline its management, ensuring greater accountability and trust.
Similarly, shipping giant FedEx (FDX) says it utilizes blockchain technology to enhance its delivery services.

48,2025-02-18,"A British homeowner recently claimed that his £6 million ($7.57 million) has sat on the market for over a decade, because former tenant and global superstar Adele once implied that the property was haunted.
“The first tenant, Adele, stayed for six months and blighted the property by saying it is haunted,” homeowner Nicholas Sutton, wrote in court documents, first obtained by the British newspaper The Times. “This comment negatively impacted future marketing efforts and continues to affect the property’s reputation to this day.”
The saga began in 2012, shortly after Adele was catapulted into international fame, with her hit song “Rolling in the Deep.” The pop star invited Anderson Cooper to Sutton’s property – named Lock House – for a “60 Minutes (PARA)” interview.
“This bit’s all quite scary, really. It was a convent for a little while,” she told Cooper, but stopped short of describing Lock House as haunted. In the ensuing years, however, tabloids often made reference to Adele’s haunted home. One tabloid even reported that she hired a bodyguard specifically to protect her from any errant spirits.
She allegedly told an anonymous friend, “I’m not rattling around here on my own. It gives me the creeps,” according to Page 6 (NWS).
Whether or not Adele truly lived in fear of paranormal roommates, the fact remains that Sutton has been unable to sell Lock House for the last 14 years. The homeowner did extensive renovations on the Edwardian property, which includes formal gardens, a tennis court, a helipad, and indoor and outdoor swimming pools.
Sutton claimed in court documents that the property is “consistently marketed by top agents,” to no avail. Now the homeowner is requesting permission from the local council, to rezone the historic property as three houses and a cottage. This follows a previous attempt to have the mansion converted into five apartments.
“This proposal provides the optimum viable use of Lock House, preserving its historical significance while delivering much-needed housing,” Sutton said of his new plan in the court documents. 
“It offers a balanced, sensitive, and sustainable solution that aligns with both heritage protection and housing policies, ensuring the long-term preservation and vitality of this important historical asset.”

Dogecoin is making headlines again as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially acknowledged asset management firm Grayscale’s filings for spot Dogecoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This marks the beginning of a review process that could potentially bring these crypto funds to market.
While the leading memecoin has cleared its first regulatory hurdle, SEC approval is far from certain. However, the news could influence Dogecoin’s price in the short term.
As of now, Dogecoin is trading at $0.25, down 4% over the past week.

Solana is one of the fastest-growing major cryptocurrencies. It competes with Ethereum in terms of speed and has emerged as a strong platform for hosting hundreds of decentralized applications (dApps). Additionally, several popular memecoins are developed on the Solana blockchain, which has further expanded Solana’s use cases.
Following the successful launch of Bitcoin and Ether ETFs, there are strong indications that Solana ETFs may be launched soon. Several asset management companies have already submitted applications for them.
Currently, Solana is trading at $169, representing a fall of 15% in a week.

Just like Grayscale’s filings for XRP and Dogecoin, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has acknowledged Canary Capital’s application for a spot Litecoin (LTC) exchange-traded fund (ETF) within two weeks of its initial filing. This news has led to a significant price surge fueled by speculation about increasing institutional interest. Due to Litecoin’s functional similarities to Bitcoin, some analysts believe that the SEC may be more inclined to approve the ETF soon.
Currently, Litecoin (LTC) is trading at $126, reflecting a 0.9% fall in a week.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping has signaled that he's ready for business again in a high-profile meeting featuring the country's top tech bosses.

        On Monday, Xi presided over a meeting with China's private sector leaders — including a beaming Jack Ma clad in a black Mao suit.
    

        At the meeting, Xi urged the executives to ""show their talent"" and messaged support for private businesses. His audience included gaming giant Tencent CEO Pony Ma, electric vehicle maker BYD CEO Wang Chuanfu, and Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei.
    

        ""It is necessary to resolutely remove all kinds of obstacles to the equal use of production factors and fair participation in market competition, Xi said, according to Xinhua state news agency.
    

        Beijing should continue to promote the fair opening of the competitive field of infrastructure to all kinds of business entities, and continue to make great efforts to solve the problem of difficult and expensive financing for private enterprises, Xi told the business leaders.
    

        On Tuesday, Chinese tech shares rallied on the positive signal that Beijing recognizes the importance of the private sector's contribution to its challenged economy.


        Xi's encouraging stance toward the private sector on Monday is a stark contrast to Beijing's scrutiny of the broader private sector over the last few years. The government has cracked down on private companies across various sectors, including those in online gaming and tutoring.


        Hong Kong's Hang Seng Tech Index closed 2.5% higher near a three-year high on Tuesday, bringing gains this year to 26%. The broader Hang Seng Index closed 1.6% higher.
    

        To be sure, Chinese tech shares have already been posting strong gains in the last few weeks following the meteoric rise of startup DeepSeek's latest flagship AI model.
    

        ""For the past few years, the Chinese authorities had prioritized national security over private sector profit-making priorities,"" Tai Wei Lim, a professor of business at Japan's Soka University, told Business Insider.
    

        Meanwhile, e-commerce giant Alibaba closed 3.2% higher in Hong Kong on Jack Ma's seeming return to favor.
    

        In late 2020, he angered Beijing with public criticism of China's financial regulators. An outspoken and high-profile Alibaba cofounder, he largely disappeared from public view after Beijing cracked down on his tech empire. It also cost Ant Group, which he founded, its initial public offering.
    

        Jack Ma's appearance at Xi's meeting with business is particularly striking because it signals that ""tech leaders seeking profit-making commercial research and products are welcomed"" once again, said Lim, who specializes in the political economy of East Asia.
    

        Xi's personal endorsement of China's tech titans on Monday further boosts sentiment amid intensifying geopolitical rivalry and a trade war with the US in President Donald Trump's second term.
    

        Against this backdrop, the rise of DeepSeek — which triggered an AI-related sell-off on Wall Street last month — highlights the importance of the private sector in China's economic ecosystem, Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis, told BI.
    

        DeepSeek's stunning breakthrough is a trigger showing ""China cannot compete with the US without equal treatment and regulatory flexibility given to private firms,"" Ng said.
    

        Despite Xi's personal stamp of approval, analysts say Beijing still needs to do more to support a broad economic recovery.
    

        ""The move can boost investors' sentiment as more capital bet on the growth in China's AI ability, but the impact on economic growth will depend on whether there is a real policy change,"" said Ng, referring to a friendly regulatory environment that provides a level playing field for all companies.
    

        But Xi's personal appearance with private sector business leaders is a big deal on its own and a sign of state support in China's high-context political culture, said Lim.
    

        ""Given Xi is the most powerful leader since Mao and he is the designated 'Core Leader,' his personal appearance at the meeting with the tech business leaders — China's version of the 'tech bros' —is all-important,"" said Lim.

Panasonic Automotive Systems, a division of Panasonic specializing in developing and manufacturing automotive equipment, is showcasing a potential expansion into the camping and mobile lifestyle market. At the Tokyo Auto Salon held in early January in Chiba City, the company introduced a cutting-edge mobility concept called the Well Cabin OFFMO.
This versatile space is designed to be easily transportable and can be set up anywhere to function as a mobile beauty salon, home office, power nap room, entertainment area, or any other purpose you may need it for. The Well Cabin OFFMO concept features a sleek, modern design with a metal exterior reminiscent of the popular travel trailers by Airstream.
Designer: Panasonic Automotive Systems







The Well Cabin OFFMO is designed and tailored specifically for companies and brands. It is intended to be a versatile trailer that can be configured in multiple ways and styles, to meet the diverse needs and requirements of people. It is founded on a single-axle trailer, and equipped with a pretty compact form that supports easy and efficient towability. It provides off-grid mobility and can be adapted in three different configurations. Each configuration has a different theme and functionality – well-being and entertainment included.
The trailer could be utilized as a “Beauty/Refreshment Charge Room,” which serves as a mobile beauty salon offering self-care and beauty treatments in a private setting anywhere. It is intended to be an ideal option for professional concierge services. Panasonic also suggests that businesses might use it as a “Healthy Power Nap Room,” providing employees with a space to take short naps to combat daytime fatigue. And, finally, the Well Cabin OFFMO can be imagined as a “Private Entertainment Room,” featuring an advanced sound system designed to immerse you in calming sounds for mental and physical relaxation.







All three models will be equipped with advanced technology to showcase how mobile automotive solutions can deliver distinctive branded experiences. The interior of the beauty salon will feature Panasonic’s innovative water-based clean ion nanoe generator to purify the air, while the entertainment room will include an Activation Seat. This seat is described by the company as a “chair that utilizes new technology combining sound and vibration to deliver a sound experience that resonates with both the mind and body.”
Depending on their intended use, the trailers can also be outfitted with massage chairs, aroma diffusers, smart mirrors, sophisticated lighting systems, and other Panasonic-developed products. Currently, the Well Cabin OFFMO is just a concept, but if it eventually enters the market, it promises to offer an immersive experience from virtually any location. Through initiatives like this, Panasonic aims to contribute to the development of a fully mobile society.

NetEase is reportedly pulling back on game development.
By 
    George Yang
   on February 19, 2025 at 4:39AM PST
Several Marvel Rivals developers at NetEase Games have been laid off, according to the game's director, Thaddeus Sasser.
Over on LinkedIn, Sasser said, ""My stellar, talented team just helped deliver an incredibly successful new franchise in Marvel Rivals for NetEase Games...and were just laid off!"" All six of Marvel Rivals' America-based devs were reportedly let go, two of whom were level designers.
These layoffs in particular come as a surprise given that Marvel Rivals has been incredibly successful and popular since its launch in December. During its first 72 hours on the market, Marvel Rivals hit 10 million players worldwide. The number doubled the following week to 20 million players.
Marvel Rivals is among the top five games in the United States across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox Series X|S. It's also one of the very few live-service games that has broken through the oversaturated genre, so the layoffs are puzzling. GameSpot contacted NetEase for comment on the decision and received the following statement:
""We recently made the difficult decision to adjust Marvel Rivals’ development team structure for organizational reasons and to optimize development efficiency for the game. This resulted in a reduction of a design team based in Seattle that is part of a larger global design function in support of Marvel Rivals. We appreciate the hard work and dedication of those affected and will be treating them confidentially and respectfully with recognition for their individual contributions.
We want to reassure our fanbase that the core development team for Marvel Rivals, which continues to be led by Lead Producer Weicong Wu and Game Creative Director Guangyun Chen in Guangzhou, China, remains fully committed to delivering an exceptional experience. We are investing more, not less, into the evolution and growth of this game. We’re excited to deliver new super hero characters, maps, features, and content to ensure an engaging live-service experience for our worldwide player-base.""
While NetEase Games isn't closing entirely and Marvel Rivals is continuing to add new playable characters, NetEase is reportedly massively scaling back on video games, especially single-player ones. The timing is especially egregious since NetEase recently revealed that the other two Fantastic Four characters, The Human Torch and The Thing, are joining the roster later this week.
The Swedish studio Liquid Swords also laid off developers this week due to prioritizing ""long-term sustainability."" The studio was founded by former Avalanche Studios CCO Chistofer Sundberg in 2020, and has yet to release its first title.

56,2025-02-18,"This GPS dog tracker is more than just that. It also adds health-tracking features and two-way comms.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.


Join Namerah Saud Fatmi as she explores the cool, quirky, and sometimes downright odd world of smartphone accessories, gadgets, and other nerdy toys every week.
Our furry companions are more than just pets; they're family. Don't you find yourself wishing you could call and check on your dog sometimes? Say you're at work or school and wondering whether your puppy is missing you. Enabot created a clever pet tracker with two-way communications embedded into it, turning this dream into reality for all of us.
The Enabot ROLA PetTracker has other merits as well, including GPS positioning, health tracking, and more. I found the $99 retail price tag very compelling after running tests on this handy pet camera slash tracker.
Right off the bat, I'll say this, though: while it's advertised for both cats and dogs, the Enabot ROLA PetTracker is simply too big for most kitties.

If you aren't already familiar with the brand, Enabot's specialty is making smart vacuum-inspired pet robots like the EBO X and RolaPet PetPal. Having mastered just the right set of skills needed for tracking and communicating with pets at home, the brand ported those features over to a more compact and mobile form factor with the ROLA PetTracker.
In essence, the ROLA PetTracker is like any other GPS tracker for your dog. There's a SIM slot for a data SIM, which enables you to track your pet in real-time, and there's a companion app where you can manage all this. But the similarities between commonplace GPS dog trackers and the ROLA PetTracker end there.
Enabot added mics and a speaker to the ROLA PetTracker so you can talk to your fur baby at any given point of the day. Both the speaker and mic can be enabled or disabled via the Rola app for Android or iOS.
However, the more impressive feat achieved by this tracker isn't its quadruple positioning system or two-way comms. It's the humble 480p camera and clever additions like a flashlight, an SOS button, and splash-proofing that make this tracker innovative.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android

For the purposes of this trial, I enlisted the help of five-month-old Rosa, a mid-sized German Shepherd mix who loves to live her best life unapologetically, every single day. This adorable menace served as the perfect test subject for the ROLA PetTracker.
The purpose of my testing was twofold. Firstly, I wanted to see whether the ROLA PetTracker can actually do the tasks advertised in the wild. And secondly, I aimed to gauge whether it's really worth investing in.
Enabot includes a harness with one mount each for both cats and dogs in the box. There's also a really small silicone collar included in there, which can't possibly fit any canine's neck without strangling it.
The idea behind the harness was good, and it was comfy as well, but it was executed poorly. The harness' flawed design lacks buckles to secure the adjusted straps in place, which caused the harness to keep slipping off of poor Rosa during our walk.
During the walk, the Enabot ROLA PetTracker slipped off and fell into puddles quite a few times. Thanks to its splash-proofing, I was able to rinse the camera off and it was good as new later.
The fickle nature of the harness caused a lot of trouble for both Rosa and me during our excursion. She kept entangling herself between the leash and the harness. It's such a shame because I was really looking forward to capturing her shenanigans from her POV in the harness-mounted videos.

I also used this opportunity outdoors to test the comms system, which worked seamlessly. Initially, Rosa was quite shocked when I used the mic and speaker to talk to her. She got used to it pretty quickly, though, and listened diligently to any commands issued.
The SOS button functions as it should and in case the battery on the tracker dies, there's a QR code printed on the ROLA PetTracker that can be scanned by others. Although the 480p camera isn't of the best quality and lacks night vision, the flashlight mitigates some of those issues.
Enabot also incorporated health-tracking metrics into the ROLA PetTracker. Not only can you log your pet's steps and record how much exercise they're getting, but you can also track individual walks using the GPS to see where you walked, when, for how long, and how many steps were taken by your pet in that duration. It's superb, really!
On top of that, the tracker leverages the camera, GPS, and two-way audio by enabling you to set up a virtual fence for your dog. Any time it ventures beyond your customized radius, you get an alert on your phone, and if you want, so does the dog via sound notification. The virtual fence with sound prompts is an awesomely humane way to train dogs not to stray too far away from home.

Knowing where your dog was when you took it for a walk has several benefits. In the event that you lose your furry friend, drop its toy somewhere, or suspect it ate something funny, being able to retrace its footsteps could save your dog's life!
All in all, the ROLA PetTracker delivers fantastic value. You get a very good price for something this feature-rich, plus it goes on sale regularly, dropping the price from an amicable $99 to a budget-friendly $79. It's a comprehensive tool that's excellent for pet health management and monitoring health metrics such as your dog's weight, steps, and exercise.
The water-repellent design can survive a good few splashes but not submersion. Dogs are messy, so I fear it won't do as well against mud and dirtier elements. However, just having splash-proofing is a bonus for a product like this.
Perhaps the only thing that I'd want to be done better — apart from the harness and tight collar — would be battery longevity. You recharge the Enabot ROLA PetTracker using a USB-C cable and charger, which is incredibly convenient, but the battery doesn't last more than a few days. So, you need to remember to charge it frequently.
There's really no other pet tracker on the market that's this lightweight and compact, this cheap, and this useful. If you like keeping a close watch on your beloved pups, I highly recommend it.


Always be with your pet
Enabot's ROLA PetTracker is the smartest GPS pet tracker available. Equipped with tools like a camera, a flashlight, an SOS button, and splash-proofing, this pet tracker is entirely unique and is yet to meet its match as an equal.

Avatar: The Last Airbender and its sequel series The Legend of Korra are both colored by their wonderful minor characters. From suave, eccentric entrepreneur Varrick and badass bounty hunter June to the Cabbage Guy and the Boulder, every corner of the Avatar-verse is packed with magnetic secondary characters who could most definitely hold a story of their own. Some get full arcs, while others only get a few moments to shine.
And my very favorite minor, one-episode character is finally getting her due in a full novel. That’s Jin, the cute girl who asks Zuko on a date in “The Tales of Ba Sing Se,” a date where he freaks out and after doing something adorable for her, vanishes into the night. In my heart, Zuko returned to Ba Sing Se and they reunited and honestly, nothing in the canon contradicts that.
Titled City of Echoes, the upcoming book comes from author Judy I. Lin (A Magic Steeped in Poison and A Venom Dark and Sweet). The official synopsis is as follows:
There is no war outside of these walls.
This is what the citizens of Ba Sing Se are told to believe, but Jin knows better. As a refugee whose parents were killed by the Fire Nation, she is haunted by her past. Now, she does her best to keep her head down in the Lower Ring, caring for her ailing grandfather and balancing school with survival. Her one bright spot is her best friend Susu, whose family treats Jin like one of their own, and whose bakery she helps make deliveries for.
Her world shatters when Susu’s father gambles away the bakery and Susu is forced to take a contract in the Upper Ring to pay off the family’s debt. Jin vows to help her friend—no matter what it takes. A chain of events fueled by her desperate promise leads Jin to Xuan, an arrogant boy from the Middle Ring with ties to the Silver Fangs, a major player in the city’s black market. The deeper Jin delves into her double life, the more she learns about Susu’s own entanglement in a conspiracy darker and more dangerous than she could have imagined.
As whispers swirl of the Avatar’s presence within the city’s walls, the Fire Nation creeps ever closer. With Ba Sing Se teetering on the brink of revolution, Jin must defy the powerful forces that control her city and risk everything for the friend she’s determined to save.
City of Echoes will kick off a new series from Abrams Books called Avatar Legends, which will dive into the lives of different “unsung heroes” of Avatar and Korra. This is not to be confused with Avatar Legends: The Roleplaying Game, which is a tabletop role-playing game. Other Avatar book spinoffs include the Chronicles of the Avatar, a book series which dove into the lives of previous Avatars like Kyoshi, Yangchen, and Roku. I’m thrilled Jin is getting her due, and I’m excited to see which other characters might be featured in the series down the line.
City of Echoes is available for pre-order now and will hit shelves on July 22.

Sony's latest live-service game is in the works from Jade Raymond's Haven Studios and is all about eating the rich.
By 
    Eddie Makuch
   on February 18, 2025 at 8:03AM PST
Sony's big push into the live-service market has been hit and miss, and the company is continuing to invest in the space with the next game from former Assassin's Creed boss Jade Raymond. Her team at the PlayStation-owned Haven Studios is making a heist-themed competitive game for PS5 and PC called Fairgame$--and yes, it's really styled that way.
Described as a ""fresh, modern take on the heist genre,"" Fairgame$ aims to be a competitive heist game where people steal from the rich to ""rebalance the scales"" in a society where billionaires hold an increasingly large share of the wealth. While the game was conceived of years ago, this setup is certainly something that remains topical today.
Not much has been said or shown of the game, but there have been some details released so far, which we're compiling together in this post.
 
Fairgame$ was announced in 2023 but was not given a release date, or window, at the time or since then. Recently, however, Jeff Grubb of GameSpot sister site Giant Bomb reported that the game slipped internally and is now tentatively set for release in 2026.
Fairgame$ is the debut title from Haven Studios. As for Raymond, she's had a turbulent career after leaving Ubisoft. She joined Google in 2019 to head up a new internal game team, but in 2021, Google closed its game studios and Raymond departed. In 2021, she founded Haven. Sony bought the company in 2022.
Fairgame$ is not yet available to preorder. In fact, we don't even know if it's going to be paid game at all.
The debut trailer for Fairgame$ was striking and impressive, but it didn't have any gameplay footage. Instead, the CG trailer was focused on setting the mood and tone for the game, which involves stealing from the rich as part of a heist-themed multiplayer experience. Check out the trailer below.

Fairgame$ is coming to PS5 and PC. Sony doesn't bring its single-player games to PC simulataneously with PS5, but it does do that for live-service games. As such, Fairgame$ would be expected to launch at the same time across PS5 and PC.
Creative director Mathieu Leduc said in a blog post that Haven was founded with the goal of making games that its staffers wanted to play, and that's why the team chose a competitive multiplayer game.
""Fairgame$ came from a desire to create a new type of PvP game with emergent sandbox gameplay. We want to deliver a fresh multiplayer experience that rewards creativity and mastery and delivers surprising stories each and every time you play,"" Leduc said.
""In a nutshell, this is a thrilling competitive heist game where you join an underground movement to rob the ultra-rich and rebalance the scales,"" Leduc said.
As you can see in the announcement trailer, Fairgame$ has players going after billionaires who have ""too much money and too much power."" In the trailer, we see a squad of players infiltrating some kind of compound, working together to take down security guards with the apparent aim of sticking it to the man.
""Fairgame$ will give you an opportunity to break the rules as a modern-day Robin Hood, a thrill seeker, or just someone who wants to collect cool loot,"" Leduc said. ""Trespass inside forbidden locations around the world, fill your pockets like a kid in a candy store and unravel the nefarious plans of untouchable billionaires.""
Back when Fairgame$ was announced in 2023, Sony was in the midst of a huge push and investment into the live-service market. At one point in time, Sony wanted to release 12 live-service games over the coming years (alongside its commitment to single-player games). However, in May 2023, Sony announced that it was halving its planned live-service game output, with management stressing it wanted to focus on quality over quantity. After this announcement, Naughty Dog's The Last of Us multiplayer game was canceled in December 2023.
At the beginning of 2024, though, Sony found its biggest success to date in the live-service market with Helldivers 2--the game went on to smash sales records and become the No. 3 overall best-selling game of 2024 in the US.
In July 2024, Sony's Destiny developer Bungie announced mass layoffs and major structural changes. A month later, Sony launched the multiplayer game Concord. It had such a dismal performance out of the gate that Sony quickly took the game offline and refunded all players. Its developer, Firewalk, was later closed.
At the end of 2024, Sony confirmed that it canceled multiple projects, including a live-service God of War and another live-service title from Bend.
It was reported in 2023 that PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, who left Sony in 2024, had a mandate that Sony's teams should make more games-as-a-service titles. A number of PlayStation developers were reportedly upset with this, and the blame was said to have fallen not on Ryan but Connie Booth, one of the most important and veteran PlayStation developers, leading to her eventual departure.
Another former PlayStation boss, Shuhei Yoshida, recently said the chance of finding success in the competitive live-service market was ""small,"" but his replacement, Hermen Hulst, was given the resources to fund both single-player games and live-service titles at the same time. However, had Yoshida stayed in that role, he said he would have ""tried to resist"" the push into the live-service market. He joked, ""That's one of the reasons they removed me.""

59,2025-02-18,"Apple (AAPL+0.23%) is releasing a new product on Wednesday — and it could be a new version of its lower-cost iPhone.
Apple chief executive Tim Cook last week teased a launch for “the newest member of the family” — which some are speculating to be an updated iPhone SE. Apple introduced the smaller iPhone model in 2016, and released a 5G version of it in 2022. 
The new version of the iPhone SE is expected to use the same A18 chip that is in the iPhone 16, have a full-screen OLED display, and include Apple Intelligence capabilities, according to reports by Bloomberg and other news outlets. The model, which is the only iPhone without Face ID, will reportedly lose its home button and look similar to the iPhone 14.
Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that iPhone SE, 14, and 14 Pro inventory at Apple stores was running low — possible signs that an upgrade is coming.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In January, analysts at Jefferies (JEF-3.53%) downgraded Apple stock to “Underperform,” citing concerns including “limited traction” for the rumored iPhone. While the new iPhone SE is expected to have one rear camera, the older iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro both have three cameras. That could make them more attractive options — especially if they have a lower price tag — despite the iPhone SE’s artificial intelligence features, Jefferies said.
An iPhone SE currently starts at $429 — hundreds of dollars less than the iPhone 16, which starts at $799. 
Meanwhile, Apple is partnering with Chinese firm Alibaba (BABA-0.91%) to support its rollout of Apple Intelligence in the country. The collaboration could help the iPhone maker gain back smartphone market share in China, which it has lost to local competitors including Huawei and Vivo. 
“They talked to a number of companies in China. In the end they chose to do business with us,” Alibaba Group chairman Joe Tsai said at the World Government Summit in Dubai, according to Reuters. “They want to use our AI to power their phones. We feel extremely honored to do business with a great company like Apple.”
Despite being the company’s “best quarter ever,” Apple missed iPhone revenue expectations for the first fiscal quarter. The tech giant reported $69.1 billion in net sales for the iPhone, while analysts had expected $70.7 billion, according to FactSet (FDS+1.14%). The company’s greater China revenue for the first quarter was down by 11% year over year.
On the company’s earnings call, Cook noted that Apple had better results in markets where it has rolled out Apple Intelligence compared to markets that don’t yet have the AI features.

To say that Samsung Electronics shareholders are unhappy would be an understatement. The company's stock has significantly underperformed its rivals like SK Hynix. It's down nearly 23% over the past year despite the company's efforts to support the share price through buybacks. 
Samsung is now cancelling some of the stock that it had bought back to further boost support for the stock. The company has been buying back billions of dollars worth of its stock over the past few years amid growing calls from its shareholders for better returns.
Samsung Electronics confirmed today that it's retiring $2.08 billion worth of treasury shares it had previously acquired to increase shareholder value. It also announced a plan to purchase another $2.08 billion worth of shares. 
The repurchases will be made on the open-market via the Korea Exchange from February 19th to May 16, 2025. It's acquiring 48,149,247 common shares and 6,636,988 preferred shares from existing shareholders. 
The idea here is simple, reduce the number of shares outstanding to hopefully increase the value of the ones left. Samsung Electronics' stock is up over 1.5% on the news of this cancellation and buyback.

Some of the shares that it acquires will be used for its employee stock compensation program while others will continue to be held in the treasury for future stabilization of the stock price.
The stock price hit a 4-year low as recently as November 2024 while SK Hynix's stock price was up nearly 30% that same year. While these corporate actions will help, investors will focus more on signs of improved fortunes for its semiconductor division and other business units before we see any significant run up to new highs.

That being said, searching for a new job while working in another is no picnic. Not only is it extremely time-consuming and mentally draining, but you are also treading a very thin line. You have to be extremely discreet while job hunting, so no one in your current job finds out. That means doing job interviews from home (or hiding in the office's supply closet, if you have no other option), avoiding conversations with your boss as much as possible, and generally keeping your head down.
Even if you do all that successfully, there is still a chance your boss will find out about your intentions of leaving the company, which happened to the employee in the story down below. Keep scrolling to read how that happened.

The Eufy security SoloCam S220 is part of a limited time deal over at Amazon.Â You can set yourself up with this wireless Eufy security camera along for the reduced price of $66, which is 49% off.Â Typically, this security camera goes for $130 which means right now you can get it for nearly half off. The Eufy SoloCam S220 is capable of a resolution up to 2K. Many security cams on the market only go up to 720p. That beyond full HD improvement could be the difference between being able to read an unwelcomed vehicleâs license plate or not.
See at Amazon
The cameras are weather resistant and waterproof, with a rating of IP67. Once you set them up, youâll never have to worry about a storm or the elements upending them from working properly. This means you can rely on them year round. Additionally, they are designed to work at nighttime. When the sun goes down, the camera can record in an exceptionally clear black and white night vision mode thanks to the f/1.6 aperture.
This Eufy S220 security camera can be set up anywhere around your property without the concern of needing them placed near a power source because it’s solar powered. Just three hours of sunlight daily can keep them running all day and all night. Installation is super easy. In just five minutes, you can attach the mount anywhere on your property thanks to the wire-free design and then click the camera into place. Presto, youâre done.
Real-time response is supported thanks to the built-in two-way audio. If someone you do or do not know approaches the door, you can speak with them without having to come to the door. The system integrates seamlessly with Amazon Alexa so you can maintain control over your surveillance via other smart devices anywhere in your home. And with the help of AI facial recognition, your Eufy SoloCam S220 can spot whoâs coming from any angle, differentiating between those who live at the house or frequently stop by versus strangers.
All videos are stored locally, but can be accessed anytime via a secure 256-bit encrypted connection. Eufy takes your privacy seriously. Local storage can fit up to three months worth of recordings via the 8 GB eMMC.
Normally, youâd be shelling out $130 for the Eufy SoloCam S220 home security system, but right now you can save 49% and get it for the low price of only $66.

Tons of home goods, appliances, electronics, and gadgets are are seeing huge discounts for President’s Day, with some particularly good options for PC parts. If youâre just trying to treat yourself to some new parts for your PC gaming rigâweâve got you covered. The Samsung 990 Pro SSD heavily discounted at the moment over at Samsung. The savings range from $60 to $145 offÂ depending on the exact version you get, be it 1TB, 2TB, or 4TB. Additionally, the variant with a heatsink is also discounted, varying from $65 to $160 off.
Say goodbye to long load times in the games you play. The Samsung 990 Pro Gen 4 SSD is designed for superior performance with fast speeds while maintaining power efficiency. It has read speeds of up to 7,450 MB/s and write speeds of up to 6,900 MB/s. This generation 4 SSD from Samsung will help you achieve this high performance while using less power overall. Compared to the 980 Pro, the 990 Pro is capable of up to 50% improved performance per watt.

See at Amazon
The Samsung Magician software will help you get the most out of your SSD, offering advanced tools that are intuitive to understands for monitoring your drive’s health, protecting your valuable data, and receiving important updates for the 990 Pro.
Gaming consoles need the extra space just as much as gaming PCs do. The original PlayStation 5 comes with only 825 GB of internal storage. With the ballooning size of AAA games on the market, youâll be lucky if you can have more than three games downloaded onto your system at a time.
We have good news. The PS5âs storage can be expanded by installing a compatible M.2 solid state drive. The Samsung 990 is compatible, but with a catch. Youâre going to want the heatsink option to prevent overheating. The heatsink also has futuristic RGB LED lights because of course it does. Right now, you can get the 1TB version of the 990 Pro with a heatsink for $130. The 2TB version goes for $180 while the 4TB version goes for $320.
Thatâs just for the console players though. If you yourself or the loved one youâre buying for is gaming on PC, then the non-heatsink version will work out just fine.Â Get the Samsung 990 Pro startingÂ at $100 for the 1TB versionÂ ($60 off),Â $170 for the 2TB versionÂ ($80 off), or $270 for the 4TB versionÂ ($195 off).

64,2025-02-18,"A 27-inch 5K monitor for just €650?

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

French startup JapanNext has introduced one of the most affordable true 5K monitors on the market.
Priced at €650 (approximately $680), the snappily named JN-IPS275K-HSPC9 (originally in French) business monitor supports Picture-in-Picture (PIP) and Picture-by-Picture (PBP) modes, allowing users to view content from multiple sources at the same time.
""It is truly a pride to release this type of monitor exclusively in Europe,"" said Victor HUON, Japannext Europe's Chief Marketing Officer in a translation from French. ""It is a real alternative to all those looking for a 5K monitor offered by other brands at much higher prices.""
The monitor features a 27-inch IPS panel with a 5120 x 2880 resolution, while supporting 100% sRGB and DCI-P3 color coverage, along with 178-degree viewing angles, minimizing color distortion.
A 2000:1 contrast ratio, 350 nits brightness, a matte finish, support for 1.07 billion colors, and HDR compatibility enhance contrast and color depth. And to get that perfect angle, the monitor features height adjustment (110mm), tilt (-5° to 20°), rotation (15° dual), and pivot (90°).
It features multiple ports, including DisplayPort 1.4 and USB-C 3.1, both capable of delivering 5K resolution at 60Hz. An HDMI 2.0 port is also available, though it's limited to outputting 5K at 30Hz. USB-A and USB-B ports are included for peripherals, along with audio output and built-in 3W speakers.
It's also VESA-compatible (100x100mm), allowing users to mount it on a stand or wall.

65,2025-02-18,"Something to look forward to: It's been a tough slog for white-collar professionals in the job market over the last few years. However, it appears that this environment is beginning to shift as companies grow more confident about the economy. 
The past few years have been particularly challenging for white-collar professionals. Despite initial prosperity during the early stages of the pandemic, the industry has faced considerable upheaval. A staggering one in four U.S. workers who lost their jobs last year were white-collar professionals, potentially indicating strain from high interest rates and the impact of technological advancements.
Another telling statistic comes from S&P Global, which reports that professional and business services jobs accounted for more than 3.7 million of the nearly 14.9 million layoffs and discharges in the U.S. through the first nine months of 2024.
The hunt for jobs has been no less painful. Another survey by the American Staffing Association and The Harris Poll found that 40 percent of applicants failed to secure even a single interview throughout 2024. This frustrating job search experience, coupled with a reduction in benefits and flexibility, has led to a phenomenon Gallup refers to as the ""Great Detachment,"" characterized by feelings of stagnation and disengagement among white-collar workers.
Now, though, new trends suggest that this landscape may be on the cusp of significant change.

""I don't think that the plight of the high end, mid-level professional is ever going to go away, but we do see green shoots on the horizon,"" Mike DiStefano, who leads professional search and interim placements at Korn Ferry, told Fortune, adding that ""change is afoot on the job market.""
DiStefano reports an uptick in search activity across various functions and industries over the past couple of months, humorously noting that he's ""seen more activity in the past 30 days than the past 30 months.""
Several factors are contributing to this potential shift, including pent-up demand following anxiety about an official recession, gradual reduction of interest rates, a high-performing stock market, and anticipated changes in federal investment with a new administration. While it's too early to predict the full impact of these factors, they collectively suggest a more optimistic outlook for white-collar professionals.
However, as the job market evolves, white-collar workers must adapt to remain competitive, DiStefano advises. ""Korn Ferry's recommendation to anybody, regardless of where they are in their career, is, you've always got to be one step ahead."" This involves making sure skills align with emerging job demands and staying current in one's field.
Skills that are particularly sought after for white-collar positions include AI and big data proficiency, networks, cybersecurity, and technological literacy in general. Analytical thinking is the most sought-after soft skill among employers, with 70 percent of companies considering it essential.
For middle-aged adults in the white-collar workforce, DiStefano suggests focusing on networking, maintaining contingency plans, and continuously updating skills. He emphasizes that the current market demands specialists rather than generalists.
While the immediate future may not bring a massive surge in demand for mid-level professional talent, DiStefano anticipates ""a steady stream of turnover and new additions driven by prolonged postponements and pent-up growth initiatives slowly being implemented.""

eBay is running some killer deals right now with unbeatable prices on refurbished laptops, like this Chromebook for just over a hundred bucks. But if you prefer Windows, you can get an equally amazing deal from Acer, whose official eBay account is selling an AMD-powered touchscreen laptop with 16GB of RAM for just $275.99.
The Acer Aspire 3 offers a 15.6-inch 1080p touchscreen, a mid-range AMD Ryzen 5 7520U quad-core processor, 16GB of RAM (which is as low as I would go for Windows 11 these days), and a roomy 1TB SSD. Those specs are hard to find on any Windows laptop under $500 right now, but Acer is selling a refurbished one for darn near half that price.
PCWorld reviewed a similar model of this laptop back in 2023. That model’s specs were different, but appears to be the same chassis. It was already a good pick at that $330 price, and that was with less RAM and storage and lacking a touchscreen. You can read the full review here.
While this one on sale is a refurbished model, Acer did the refurbishing and even bundles the laptop with a two-year Allstate warranty. That’s about as good as it gets for consumer electronics in less-than-new condition, and it’s kibble for the penny-pincher. I’ll also point out that this model can be upgraded with even more RAM and storage if you’re so inclined (which isn’t a given with laptops these days).
Acer has already sold nearly 2,000 of these refurbished laptops during this sale. There’s no telling how long the stock will hold out. If you’re in the market for a fantastic deal on a budget laptop, I’d snag one of these ASAP.

68,2025-02-18,"People take pictures of the newly unveiled all-electric battery-powered Tesla's Cybertruck with ...

BROWN/AFP via Getty Images)
People touting the inevitability of the energy transition to net zero emissions, electrification, renewables and so forth often point to the rollout of mandates and bans around the world, from electric vehicle (EV) dominance in China and Norway to mandated market shares, from Korea to Laos. Global EV Policy Explorer – Data Tools - IEA Many insist that EVs are already superior to conventional vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICE), yet also worry that reduced government support will hurt sales.
But EV proponents tend to be disingenuous if not downright dishonest. Many advocates treat EV shortcomings as a non-issue, making numerous rationalizations and contortions to explain them away. The prime example: claiming that range anxiety is not a real concern. Pointing to new models with ranges allegedly reaching 300, 400 and 500 miles ignores the fact that, first, the longest ranges are usually for either very small light-weight models or very expensive, luxury models. Second, official estimates of ranges tend to be exaggerated. Third, it’s not only range limits that cause anxiety but the difficulty of finding a charger. And finally, range fluctuates enormously depending on driving conditions such as speed and ambient temperature.
One story described a study refuting that problem. “[Range anxiety is] the fear that these vehicles will run out of electricity before reaching a destination or recharging point, leaving the driver stranded by the road-side on a long journey,” says Dr Bunce.
“But research I’ve been part of reveals that this fear is greatly unjustified. With a little planning, people rarely, if ever, find themselves stranded.” (LMnews) Expert drives policy on electric cars - London Metropolitan University
Interestingly, that research was done in 2013 (apparently it was not published but delivered as a poster), when the median range of EVs in the U.S. was 82 miles, versus 2022 when it has risen to 257 miles. FOTW #1290, May 15, 2023: In Model Year 2022, the Longest-Range EV Reached 520 Miles on a Single Charge | Department of Energy Which might explain why some are skeptical of pro-EV claims. Indeed, the movie “Who Killed the Electric Car?” about GM’s EV1 leaves the viewer thinking the technology was poised to dominate the automotive industry. Yet as the table below shows, the EV-1 was far inferior to the early Tesla Model 3s.
Advances in EV Technology (Lynch and Sandrea 2021)
Source: The Pandemic and the End of Oil? The Pandemic, Peak Oil Demand, and the Oil Industry – By Michael Lynch and Ivan Sandrea – EPRINC
First, the actual range of EVs must be addressed. The EPA fuel efficiency estimates of gasoline powered cars were overstated but are much less so now. Consumer Reports found 57% of ICE cars delivered lower than expected fuel efficiency, but found that 80% of those were within 1 mpg of the official estimate, meaning range is overstated by 10-20 miles, or a fraction of the discrepancy for many EVs. How Accurate are EPA’s Fuel Economy Labels?
Estimates of EV efficiency and range are much worse. For example, one group found that the WLTP[1] estimate of a Kia Nio’s range was 288 miles, but they described the real world range as 235 miles. All you need to know about electric vehicle range | DriveElectric Further, even the advocates at GreenCars.com admit that the full 100% of battery capacity should not be relied on. “It is best to never charge your EV battery over 80 percent. Charging happens in such a way as to put stress on the battery pack the closer you are to a 100 percent charge. Adding that final 20 percent will tax the battery. New EVs allow you to set a charging maximum to help you preserve battery life.
“Likewise, never let your battery discharge all the way down to zero percent of charge. That is equally distressing to the battery and components. Most EVs have a ‘limp home mode’ that will allow low speed driving to get you back to your home charger.” EV Battery Maintenance Best Practices | GreenCars
Other factors reduce EV range. In cold weather, the Department of Energy estimates that EV range drops 41% versus 10-20% for conventional vehicles in city driving. Fuel Economy in Cold Weather | Department of Energy (Driver behavior, such as speeding and rapid acceleration affects both types of vehicles.) But essentially, the effective range for EVs is generally significantly less than for conventional vehicles, at least 30% below official estimates, and also highly uncertain.
Advocates explain that there are many things drivers can do to cope with the problem. For example, one writer suggests tinted windows eliminate range anxiety, by reducing heating and air conditioning needs and thus adding 10% to EV range. How Window Tint Can Eliminate Range Anxiety | Tint View Another suggests EVs can be ‘hypermiled’ by not putting roof racks on the car, emptying the junk out of the trunk, buying low-resistance windshield wipers and tires, with proper inflation and wheel alignment, as well as turning off unneeded accessories like air conditioning. How to Hypermile with an Electric Car - autoevolution Others suggest EV refueling isn’t inconvenient, as you can simply get lunch while the vehicle charges, or as one writer notes, you can always swap your EV with a friend with a conventional car for long trips. EV road trip - Can you drive long distances with an EV? | Virta
Or you could just buy a smaller ICE vehicle and get the same emissions reductions will paying less. So, yes, electric vehicles have become cheaper (but not cheap), more capable (but not as capable as conventional cars) and making great inroads in many markets (where heavily subsidized).

Chinese DRAM manufacturers CXMT and Fujian Jinhua have usurped Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix by undercutting prices.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Leading DRAM makers — Micron, Samsung, and SK hynix — may cease production of DDR3 and DDR4 memory by the end of the year. The decision is due to low prices caused by dumping (by Chinese makers) and declining demand, reports DigiTimes. This may potentially cause shortages of DDR4 memory that is still used in entry-level PCs and consumer electronics.
Chinese DRAM manufacturers Changxin Memory Technology (CXMT) and Fujian Jinhua have been ramping up production of DDR4 while aggressively lowering prices. Late last year their DDR4 chips were priced at half the cost of similar products from South Korean competitors. In some cases, Chinese DDR4 memory ICs were even 5% cheaper than refurbished chips. As a result, leading DRAM producers may no longer earn profit by selling DDR4, which is why they may have to phase out this type of memory while focusing on more profitable DDR5 (well, until Chinese companies start to produce it in volumes and dump on the global market) and HBM.
However, there is a catch, as demand for DDR4 is quite strong, and Chinese makers may not meet it. Thus, as soon as Micron, Samsung, and SK hynix cease to make DDR3 and DDR4 memory for the spot market, DDR4 supply constraints could emerge after mid-2025, according to DigiTimes analysts.
Taiwanese producers may step in to bridge the gap, but both Nanya Technology and Winbond Electronics only produce specialized types of DRAM, which means relatively low volumes and high prices. Yet, some industrial customers are unlikely to adopt China-made DRAMs and are more likely to adopt specialized memory from Nanya and Winbond instead.
Nanya Technology predicts the market will reach its lowest point in early 2025, followed by a recovery in the second quarter. This rebound will be fueled by stronger demand, better stock management, and economic stimulus. AI-related cloud computing is expected to remain a major driver, while general consumer demand is projected to see only a slight improvement.
Winbond Electronics, facing weakening demand for older DDR versions, is moving to a more advanced 16nm process in late 2025. This upgrade from 20nm will allow the company to produce higher-capacity 8Gb DDR chips.

Activision wants your feedback.
By 
    Eddie Makuch
   on February 18, 2025 at 12:12PM PST
Activision has announced Call of Duty: Recon Squad--but it's not the next entry in the series. Recon Squad is a new community feedback program that Activision is launching to gather thoughts and opinions from fans about the state of the game. Activision is debuting this as online sentiment around the state of Call of Duty is wavering, with many saying Activision is not doing enough to support the game.
In a blog post, Activision said Black Ops 6 and Warzone players may receive an invitation to join Recon Squad via an invitation from the market research company Fuel Cycle.
""You'll have opportunities to provide feedback through surveys, online community discussion boards, and potentially even invited to focus groups,"" Activision said.
Players in the Recon Squad program can earn points by submitting feedback that can then be redeemed for in-game content for Black Ops 6 and/or Warzone. To begin with, Fuel Cycle surveys will focus on recently released content for Black Ops 6 and Warzone, along with ""many other topics related to Call of Duty.""
The feedback program is available by invitation only. Activision said it's looking for feedback from ""all types of players,"" including those who play Call of Duty a lot and those who do not. Players will be informed of an invitation to the program by way of the email they have connected to their Activision ID.
In recent weeks and months, some Call of Duty players have complained about the state of the game in Black Ops 6 and Warzone, especially in the area of cheating. Players have also expressed opinions about Activision simply not giving players enough compelling reasons to come back to Call of Duty.
In other news, Activision just announced a lot of new maps, modes, features, and more coming to Black Ops 6 and Warzone in the Season 2 Reloaded update, including the long-awaited TMNT crossover. The update arrives February 20.

                Employees at the National Institutes of Health are among those at several health agencies who received termination letters this past weekend as part of the Trump administration's push to cut federal employees.

Termination letters landed in the mailboxes of hundreds of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health over the weekend, as the Trump administration moved ahead with firings announced verbally Friday.
That's according to more than half a dozen current staffers who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly and feared repercussions.
The number of employees who lost their jobs at the NIH and CDC was lower than initially expected. At CDC, current staff members say they haven't been told why and still fear that more cuts could be coming.
Among staff who were caught up in the first wave of layoffs: Ph.D.-trained scientists tasked with helping local and state officials respond to outbreaks; employees who ensure that medical devices for patients with cancer and diabetes are safe; and a public health worker stationed at an international airport who enforces regulations to prevent animals carrying rabies and other infectious diseases from entering the U.S.
Altogether, about 750 CDC employees received termination letters over the weekend, according to a current CDC staffer who was on a call with agency leadership and another who reviewed an internal memo.
On Friday, CDC leadership told staff that 10% of the agency's workforce — about 1,300 employees — would be notified they'd be losing their jobs.
""I'm going to work tomorrow and I don't know who's employed,"" said one of the CDC staffers, who had yet to receive any official notification about exactly which employees in their division had lost their jobs.
At the National Institutes of Health, between 1,000 and 1,200 employees received notification Saturday night that they were being cut, two staffers with knowledge of the situation told NPR. This is a few hundred fewer than was expected.
Officials were able to save some jobs because certain positions were deemed essential, such as people who work at the NIH's clinical center, one person said. 
Cuts at the FDA hit people who do research and approvals on the medical device side of the agency, according to fired FDA employees who were fearful of the consequences of speaking out. 
Staffers who work on drug approvals were temporarily spared, a current FDA employee told NPR.
HHS, CDC, FDA and NIH did not respond to NPR's request for comment.
NPR reviewed termination letters sent to staff at the CDC, NIH and FDA.
All of them used similar language and cited inadequate performance as the reason for their firing — yet the employees NPR spoke with had records of stellar work.
""Unfortunately, the Agency finds you are not fit for continued employment because your ability, knowledge and skills do not fit the Agency's current needs, and your performance has not been adequate to justify further employment at the Agency,"" the letters from the Office of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services states.
The letters set a termination date effective March 14, 2025.
At all three agencies, most who lost their jobs were staff in their probationary periods — a prolonged trial of one to two years for new employees or those who have moved to new positions within the agency — who have fewer worker protections.
Dr. Steve Monroe, a former senior CDC official, called the decision ""extremely shortsighted,"" because it swept up people ""regardless of whether they were filling an important role in the organization or how well they were performing.""
Some employees were left on edge and confused about their job status and what to expect in the coming days.
For example, some who had been explicitly told they'd be terminated have yet to receive a letter, including fellows in the CDC's high-profile Epidemic Intelligence Service, a premier training program for what are called ""disease detectives,"" staff who are dispatched to respond to outbreaks.
A current CDC staffer said they would love to know that cohort had been spared at the last minute, but they weren't necessarily ""optimistic,"" given the mass firings over the weekend.
The job cuts dealt blows to some essential functions of the federal health agencies.
NPR heard from several FDA staff, who spoke anonymously because they fear retribution for speaking up, who worked on reviews for devices that do things like detect cancer and help people with diabetes. They say they have kept devices that don't work or are dangerous off the market and fear that downsizing their ranks could be dangerous to consumers.
At NIH, offices involved in reviewing and administering grants to researchers outside the agency, such as at universities and medical centers, were hit hard, one staffer with knowledge of the situation said. The NIH spends most of the agency's $48 billion annual budget on this kind of ""extramural"" research to find new cures for cancer, heart disease and other diseases.
""Our nation cannot afford to hollow out our research and public health assets,"" Mary Woolley, president and CEO of Research!America, an advocacy group, said in a statement. ""Patients are waiting; lives are at stake.""
At CDC, fellows who respond to disease outbreaks from at least two celebrated CDC training programs were cut. Twenty fellows in the Laboratory Leadership Service received termination letters on Saturday. They ""help develop the tests for new and emerging diseases,"" one fellow explains. Those in the program have doctoral degrees and are often co-deployed with fellows in the Epidemic Intelligence Service for outbreak responses.
Every person in the lab fellowship cohort had received a letter and a performance review a few weeks ago attesting to the high quality of their work, the fellow said: ""We included that letter in the response email to show good standing and more than adequate performance.""
Monroe, the former CDC official, worries these cuts could ""hobble"" the nation's ability to respond to outbreaks. ""Losing them today means that there's less capacity to assist states tomorrow if there's a need for an outbreak investigation,"" he says. 
In the longer term, the cuts may result in fewer people getting trained or choosing to work in public health. ""A year from now, there won't be the people that have a year and a half of experience because we cut them loose,"" he says.
The ranks of the Public Health Associate Program were also decimated by the layoffs. The fellowship embeds recent college- and masters-level graduates in state and local health departments and serves as a pathway for careers in public health, says a current CDC staffer familiar with the program.
A CDC employee who was charged with preventing the introduction of zoonotic diseases (those that jump from animals to humans) had assumed they'd be safe from layoffs because their work involved national security and border control. They'd recently received a CDC award of excellence.
It's also not clear how the firings will save the government money, says Patti Zettler, a law professor at Ohio State University who served as deputy general counsel to HHS, covering the FDA, until January.
For instance, FDA user fees, paid by drug and device-makers, began in the 1990s to speed up things like drug and device approvals. In exchange for the fees, the agency commits to hiring more staff and reviewing applications for new products more quickly.
""When we think about all of the layoffs across HHS, none of them are going to save the taxpayer money in the long run,"" she says. ""It is especially clear that laying off FDA staff who are funded by user fees will not save the taxpayers any money. The taxpayers are not paying for these employees.""
In response to a request for comment on the cuts when word of them came out Friday: Andrew Nixon, director of communications at HHS, wrote in an email to NPR: ""HHS is following the Administration's guidance and taking action to support the President's broader efforts to restructure and streamline the federal government. This is to ensure that HHS better serves the American people at the highest and most efficient standard.""

Construction for the world’s largest data center has been given the go-ahead in South Korea, and is predicted to bring in an initial revenue of $3.5 billion - with an initial project size of $10 billion and the potential to reach $35 billion.
The data center will be built in the Jeollanam-do province, and will have a 3GW capacity - marking a huge advancement in Korea’s tech leadership, reportedly being able to, ‘triple' the capacity of current hyper-scale facilities operated by the likes of Microsoft, Google, and Amazon.
The project was co-founded by LG Electronics heir Brian Koo and Dr. Amin Badr-El-Din in partnership with Stock Farm Road, who have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Governor Kim of the Jeollanam-do province.
The center is set to complete construction by 2028, by which time the worldwide market is projected to grow to $438.70 billion.
Despite the significant challenges data center development faces, such as a dramatic increase in energy and water consumption, as well as consistent needs for infrastructure upgrades to keep up with, Koo noted the project could, ‘elevate Korea and the region to a new level of technological advancement and economic prosperity’.
Countries across the globe are developing their data center infrastructure, with Meta committing to spending $10 billion dollars to build a new project in the US - although this is only expected to generate 500 direct jobs once completed.
“This is more than just a technological milestone; it's a strategic leap forward for Korea's global technological leadership,” said co-founder Dr. Amin Badr-El-Din.

78,2025-02-18,"Kevin Gordon, Director and Senior Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab (SCHW), spoke with Quartz for the latest installment of our “Smart Investing” video series.
Watch the interview above and check out the transcript below. The transcript of this conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
ANDY MILLS (AM): The Wall Street Journal published an article about a survey showing that investors haven’t been this pessimistic about stocks since 2023. Are you seeing this data over at Schwab?
KEVIN GORDON (KG): So not reflected to the extent that that survey from the American Association of Individual Investors is showing. That is mostly, I think, reflective of what’s going on geopolitically from a trade war, tariff war perspective, and maybe to some extent from an immigration perspective. And we’ve seen a little bit of a rolling back in ETF flows specifically in the equity market, which is what I cover, but not to the extreme in terms of the spike in bearishness that that particular survey is citing. I will say what’s been really interesting in this post-pandemic era is the swings in attitudinal sentiment are much wider and much more skittish than what you would see on the behavioral side of things. So since the bear market ended in 2022, we really haven’t seen this massive shift in equity market positioning. If anything, the exposures kind of crept higher over time. In some metrics, we’re at the most exposed in terms of American investors most exposed to equities that we’ve ever been, so it’s not necessarily being reflected in some of the surveys that you cite, but I think to some extent if you do start to see, or at least continue to see a pickup in bearishness, and if there is a more sustained level of bearishness, then you could probably start to see that at some point being reflected in equity market positioning. I think the bigger story is kind of being told at the sector level and how much of that is more rotation versus pulling out of equities altogether. There’s been a much more interesting shift at play where there’s been more outflows from tech and tech-related areas, like communication services, to some extent consumer discretionary, and more going into areas like financials and more cyclical-dominated areas in parts of the market.
AM: Tech had a huge year last year and now things  appear to be evening out. How are you preparing investors and clients that you work with?
KG: Yeah, at the sector level, in terms of our ratings and rankings, we still have two outperform right now for financials and communication services. Tech is labeled as a market perform for us, so kind of in that neutral category. The one underperform we have is consumer discretionary. And the reasoning is a mix of, you know, you’ve got heavy concentration from the two largest members in that index, which is Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla. But apart from that, there are still some pressures in that sector, especially for areas like home builders. If you think about facing that double whammy of potentially higher input costs for materials via tariffs or a little bit more of a strain on the labor force. If you are to see more of a carrying out of either deportations and or more of a curbing of immigration, there’s a little bit more of a struggle for that sector, at least from a margin standpoint. But from a positioning perspective overall broadly for the market, especially as it relates to a lot of these policy cross-currents that we’re facing, it’s more about managing expectations around volatility and understanding that these swings that we could see based on day-to-day tariff developments or based on day-to-day labor market developments or eventually tax policy that’s likely to persist. The kinds of swings and excitement you get when tariffs are delayed, but then that pessimism that starts to creep back in when there seems to be more aggressive action being taken for tariffs. That, to us, is what’s going to make this year very different from last year. Because last year, pretty remarkable in terms of low volatility at the index level, the max drawdown for the S&P 500 was 8.5%. That’s a pretty great year for the market. This year we just expect more swings and wider swings in both directions.
AM: Interesting. So you’ve mentioned some emotionality driving like investor sentiment, but the behaviors aren’t changing. Is there a thing that investors should look for in the news or with Trump or tariffs where they should behave differently?
KG: I think that once you start to get more details and so-called meat on the bones with tariffs or immigration, ‘cause we really view those as the two big policy spheres or discussions for this year, maybe for the next several years. But if there’s more details and if you actually start to see tariffs enacted, that’s a very different scenario than what we’ve seen so far because what we’ve seen so far, excluding the 10% rate that has been applied to imports from China, there really has been just kind of discussion and talk. We’ve had these minor trade disputes, whether it was the very brief trade dispute with Colombia or the also very brief trade dispute with Canada and Mexico. Those tariffs have been delayed, not canceled. But if those start to go on and then you actually start to see more material increases in price levels, but also subsequently potentially a hit to business confidence or potentially a hit to business CapEx, that’s where we would focus the most attention in terms of the eventual hit to the equity market. So it’s tough right now because this does change day-to-day in terms of what tariffs are going on, which country it’ll be applied to, how long they’re going to last. So until you get that material action of tariffs or if we ever get there, that’s when we start to put more context around what this actually means. But it’s tough now because it’s mostly speculation because nobody knows what’s gonna happen, you know, three days from now or three hours from now.
AM: Awesome. Thanks a lot, Kevin.

82,2025-02-18,"After its unveiling at the EICMA 2024 expo last November, Aprilia's brought its twin-cylinder Tuono 457 naked streetfighter to the market. It's arrived first in India, where it's being manufactured alongside its faired twin, the RS 457.
Built with A2 license holders in mind, this mean little machine maxes out at 47.6 hp at 9,400 RPM. That's not a lot, but given that this power will be delivered by a twin-cylinder mill in a featherweight 350 lb (159 kg) package, you can expect it to be fairly quick and fun on the road.
Unlike Aprilia's other Tuonos, this one is stripped of a fairing to reveal a segment-first aluminum frame (instead of the steel that's used more often in this class) that helps keep the weight down.
You've got preload-adjustable suspension in the front and rear. That includes upside-down 41-mm forks with 120 mm of travel, and a monoshock with 130 mm at the back. Aprilia says it's fitted slim-ish tires on both 17-inch wheels to allow for agile handling, at the cost of a bit of road presence.
Brembo's budget ByBre braking equipment delivers stopping power through a 320-mm disc in front and a 220-mm one at the rear, with dual-mode switchable ABS.
With its low 31.5-in (800-mm) seat height, flat handlebars, and mid-set footpegs, the Tuono 457 will have you in a fairly sporty riding triangle. You won't be tucked in like on an RS 457 with clip-ons, but you'll be leaned forward a fair bit for an engaging ride.
Now, on to the tech. The Tuono gets three riding modes that switch up engine mapping and traction control, the aforementioned switchable ABS, and Bluetooth connectivity on the dash. You can navigate it all via backlit switchcubes, and view your settings on a 5-inch full-color TFT display.
Lastly, you can choose between Piranha Red and Puma Gray colorways. There's also a host of accessories to bolt on, including tire pressure sensors, a bi-directional quickshifter, alternative seats, bar-end mirrors and luggage.
The Tuono 457 is priced at 395,000 INR in India, which works out to US$4,546. You can expect it to cost a bit more in the US and other markets when it goes on sale globally.
It'll go up against KTM's Duke 390 and Royal Enfield's Guerilla 450, which offer similar power figures and lower price points, but higher curb weights. So while you might pay more for Aprilia's streetfighter, you'll get a lighter machine that should feel more nimble around corners.

n 2024, crypto finally went mainstream. The approval of a dozen spot bitcoin ETFs triggered a flood of institutional capital, transforming what had been a market dominated by retail speculators into one gaining broader acceptance on Wall Street. Then came Donald Trump's election victory, which sent digital assets soaring on hopes that his administration would usher in a golden age for crypto. By December, bitcoin had shattered the $100,000 mark.
Trump’s pro-crypto stance became clear early, marked by key appointments and orders: entrepreneur and venture capitalist David Sacks was named AI and Crypto Czar, Scott Bessent took over at Treasury, and former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins was nominated to lead the regulatory agency. Trump also signed an executive order titled “Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology,” which, among other initiatives, called for the assessment of a “national digital asset stockpile.”
In this climate, firms like Figure, Securitize, and Fireblocks thrived, riding some of the industry's most prominent trends.
Take tokenized real-world assets (RWAs)—a concept that has evolved from buzzword to billion-dollar business. Case in point: Figure, cofounded by former SoFi CEO Mike Cagney, is applying blockchain technology to traditional lending, having tokenized more than $13 billion in home equity lines of credit. Securitize, meanwhile, partnered with BlackRock to launch BUIDL, a tokenized U.S. treasury product that has already attracted $640 million in investments.
Then there’s Fireblocks, a leader in crypto infrastructure. Having secured over $6 trillion in digital asset transactions, the company isn’t slowing down. It recently introduced a state-regulated custody platform and AI-driven trading optimization tools designed to meet the growing needs of institutional clients.
Here are the three fintech companies that made the Fintech 50 in 2025:
Headquarters: New York, New York.
Cofounded by former SoFi CEO Mike Cagney, Figure uses technology to speed up the process of getting a home equity line of credit (HELOC). It also has a customized blockchain platform that tokenizes (i.e., securitizes) and sells HELOCs to yield-hungry investors through its own private credit marketplace. Figure’s revenue grew by more than 50% in 2024 to $321 million, up from $196 million in 2023, with a 55% gross profit margin. Some 70% of its 150,000 clients have come through its more than 200 fintech and mortgage banking partners, including real estate platforms such as RATE (formerly Guaranteed Rate) and Intuit’s Credit Karma. In April, Michael Tannenbaum, a former Brex executive, became CEO and Cagney became executive chair.
Funding: $500 million from Apollo, Morgan Creek and Ribbit, among others.
Latest valuation: $3.2 billion.
Date of last valuation: May 2021.
Bona fides: Its software has been used to originate more than $13 billion of HELOCs.
Cofounders: Executive chair Mike Cagney, 53; June Ou, 59, previously president and now an advisor.
CEO: Michael Tannenbaum, who previously held roles as chief revenue officer at SoFi and chief operating officer at Brex before joining Figure in 2024.
Headquarters: New York, New York.
Its software helps investors, as well as institutions like Worldpay, Revolut, BNP Paribas and BNY Mellon, hold cryptocurrencies securely. The company, which was unprofitable in 2024 despite booking $124 million in revenue, is spending big on new initiatives to support the digital asset activities of everyone from banks to startups. Notable product launches over the past year include a New York state regulated limited-purpose trust company designed to offer bank-grade custody to clients and an artificial intelligence tool that helps clients be more responsive to market events with their trading activity.
Funding: $1 billion from Spark Capital, Cyberstarts and Coatue, among others.
Latest valuation: $8 billion.
Date of last valuation: January 2022.
Bona fides: Since founding, its infrastructure has supported more than $6 trillion in trades.
Cofounders: CEO Michael Shaulov, 42, who previously founded cyber security startup Lacoon Mobile Security; chief technology officer Pavel Berengoltz, 48; chief product officer Idan Ofrat, 43.
Headquarters: Miami, Florida.
Securitize puts real world assets like Treasuries or private equity shares on blockchains to make them easy for investors to buy and sell. Its flagship product is BUIDL, a tokenized treasury product launched in March 2024 in partnership with BlackRock, which has $11 trillion in assets under management. BUIDL currently holds $640 million in assets. In October 2024, Securitize launched an expanded suite of fund administration services.
Funding: $170 million from BlackRock, Blockchain Capital and Morgan Stanley, among others.
Latest valuation: $479 million.
Date of last valuation: July 2022.
Bona fides: It has tokenized more than $1 billion in total assets with partners including BlackRock, Hamilton Lane and KKR.
Cofounders: CEO Carlos Domingo, 54; president Jamie Finn, 47.

Consequently, employers (and business clients if you’re a freelancer) will highly prize and prioritize candidates and professionals who are well-versed in AI, can analyze data, and can adapt, innovate, and contribute meaningfully to the modern workplace.
Coursera, the online education platform, just released its annual Job Skills Report for 2025, and as always, it highlighted the top 10 skills trending in high demand overall. Coursera analysts arrived at their conclusions by comparing skills data for over 1,000 skills in their database and analyzing what courses are increasing in demand on their enterprise learning platform among job seekers, working professionals, and students.
Their analysis revealed the following top 10 skills for 2025, which were categorized into AI, business, and tech skills:
What makes these skills so critical in 2025? And when and where should you incorporate them into your resume?
Take generative AI, for example. This is a skill that is applicable across all industries, roles, and levels. Approximately 62% of employers will expect you to have a decent level of AI fluency when you join their workforce, so it's essential to have this covered.
The next set of tech skills employers are looking for this year centers around preventing and managing threats to their technical infrastructure. This includes SIEM, threat management and modeling, risk mitigation, and network planning and design. Of course, most of this will only be relevant to you if your role is more IT-focused. However, cybersecurity (guarding against cyber-attacks) is a responsibility that all professionals must shoulder, regardless of one’s role. This is especially the case if you work remotely or at least hybrid remotely.
As technology expands, HR has several opportunities for use cases that enable performance management, learning and development, and recruitment functions to be more efficient. So, if you’re an HR professional, it’s critical to highlight your use of AI-powered people management tools and keep yourself updated on the latest trends in HR technology.
Finally…did you notice in Coursera’s list that of all the skills listed, the three commonly known as “soft” skills (today referred to as power skills) are all about communication?
Business communication, assertiveness, and stakeholder communications are critical not only to organizational success and business growth but also to your personal career growth. The need for this is further exasperated by remote and hybrid working models, which see workers collaborating across multiple time zones and cultures. Skills like active listening and empathy, emotional intelligence, promptness, clarity, and confidence are necessary to have exceptional communication skills--whether engaging with your boss, with a co-worker, presenting to a client, or leading a partnership meeting.
Not all of these skills will apply to your current job. For example, if you work in marketing, having a solid grasp of people management technology is not only not required but also irrelevant. It will make you look like you lack focus in your career and are too much of a generalist (unless you are making a career pivot into HR). So, it’s up to you to determine which of these 10 skills are most needed in your role and incorporate them into your resume. The best way to attempt this is to include examples and reference times in your job history where these specific skills have been called for, how you used them, and, most importantly, what the results were.
Finally, highlight certifications and ongoing training, including industry-recognized qualifications and in-house training you participated in. And, of course, regardless of your role or industry, communication skills are non-negotiable. Find creative ways to incorporate examples of your strong stakeholder communication skills—whether for reports, presentations, chairing meetings, or resolving conflict—to enable project success.
AI, business communication, and technical risk management and security are the skillsets most needed ... [+] in 2025
Acquiring these skills will not only boost your chances of successfully landing your dream job, but it will also help you become more confident in your role, be in higher demand, and boost your earning potential."

or private financial technology companies, last year was a quiet one for fundraising. Fintechs raised $34 billion in 2024, down from $42 billion in 2023 and an all-time high of $144 billion in 2021, reports CB Insights.
Yet a large group of young companies, some founded as much as a decade ago, started to hit their stride in 2024, showing impressive innovation and fast growth. On our 2025 Fintech 50 list, 18 of the 50 winners had never before made the cut.
The Payments category claimed the most first-timers, with six. DailyPay, led by former marketing executive Stacy Greiner, who became CEO last year, lets employees access their wages right after they’ve earned them. The 10-year-old company counts more than 1,000 businesses, including Hilton and Kroger, as customers, and last year it expanded to become available to more than five million employees.
San Francisco-based Highnote, another newcomer, makes software that lets businesses issue customizable debit and credit cards, and it more recently launched a product that helps businesses accept online credit and debit payments, putting it in competition with companies like Stripe. It raised $90 million in new funding at a valuation of more than $750 million in January 2025. Squire, a New York company led by former lawyer Songe LaRon, helps barbershops do everything from schedule appointments to accept payments; last year it processed $740 million in transactions, up from $590 million in 2023.
In our Business to Business Banking category, which had three-first timers, Arc is a commercial bank specializing in private credit. It has a lending platform that uses AI to convert raw data into credit metrics and provides cash management and treasury products to businesses. In 2024, it processed $4 billion in loan applications and more than doubled its cash management account customers to 2,500. Parafin is a small business lender founded by three former Robinhood data scientists. It uses data from marketplaces like Walmart, DoorDash and Amazon to underwrite loans, instead of relying on credit scores or personal guarantees from the owners. In 2024, Parafin reached 25,000 borrowers, and its revenue more than doubled to $75 million.
Our Wall Street and Enterprise category also had three companies making their debut on the Fintech 50. Brico, founded by former consultant and fintech product manager Snigdha Kumar, helps fintechs and other nonbank financial players automate the cumbersome state-by-state licensing process and other regulatory requirements. It has landed customers like card issuer Marqeta and Bilt, a consumer credit card startup that also made its debut on our list this year (in the personal finance category).
Another first-timer, fraud prevention firm DataVisor, was cofounded by Chinese immigrants Yinglian Xie and Fang Yu, both with U.S. PhDs in computer science. It uses patented machine learning algorithms to flag fraudulent payments and grew its revenue 67% in 2024, reaching $50 million. Zip makes software that organizes and orchestrates the complex processes of procurement, visualizing the steps necessary for a business to complete a purchase. Just four years after its founding, Zip reached a $2.2 billion valuation last fall, and its customers include OpenAI, Snowflake and Prudential.
Real estate was our smallest category on the list this year, with just two companies making the cut overall. Yet even with high interest rates creating a tough environment for real estate, one was a first-timer. Newcomer Aven issues home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) that can be tapped via a credit card. With consumers’ homes as collateral, the company’s cards offer a lower interest rate than on normal, unsecured credit cards, while its data and tech shrink the normal HELOC approval time. The billion-dollar company launched in 2020 after CEO Sadi Khan spent 18 months developing the product. It has more than 30,000 customers and hit $200 million in revenue on an annualized basis in 2024.
Across all categories, lending businesses seem to be making a comeback from years ago, when they were often maligned by industry investors and CEOs. Among our 18 first-timers, six are lenders, including Arc, Aven, Bilt, Figure, Imprint and Parafin.
Headquarters: San Francisco, California.
Arc is a neo-commercial bank specializing in private credit and relies on artificial intelligence instead of traditional analysts. It offers two core services: commercial banking, which provides cash management and treasury solutions, and a capital markets platform that uses AI to convert raw data into credit metrics. These metrics are shared with a network of lenders, including private credit funds and banks. With its more efficient, AI-reliant model, Arc charges about 1% for debt offerings, compared to the 3% to 5% charged by traditional banks. In 2024, Arc processed over $4 billion in loan applications; its largest deal was $200 million and average loans were in the tens of millions.

87,2025-02-18,"Phones with foldable displays are becoming increasingly common these days. But laptops? That’s not really a thing for now. However, Lenovo could be getting ready to change our perception. According to a post on X by tipster Evan Blass (protected account), Lenovo might launch a new laptop with a foldable display at MWC 2025.
The laptop in question is rumored to be known as the Lenovo ThinkBook Flip AI PC. This is a laptop that looks like a regular laptop, except that it has a foldable display. When the display is fully unfolded, it will be twice as tall as a regular laptop display. Users will also have the option of folding the display behind the primary display.
This will allow users to stow the second half of the display when it’s not in use. Alternatively, they can use it as a secondary display so that someone else can see what’s on their screen. This could be useful for more intimate presentations or just screen sharing in general. We’re not sure if Lenovo is introducing software features that allows the second half of the display to mirror the primary display, so we’ll have to wait and see.
What’s interesting is that Lenovo seems to be going all-in with flexible display technologies on their computers. At CES 2025, the company showed off a laptop with a rollable display. This laptop will be hitting the market in the summer of 2025, but we’re not sure if this foldable laptop from Lenovo will launch alongside it or go on sale at a later date.

Headphones are great for ensuring the privacy of our listening experience and blocking out the world from ruining it. They’re also great for avoiding inconveniencing or annoying other people by saving them from having to hear music or audio shows they never subscribed to. Unfortunately, headphones also isolate us and prevent us from sharing our joys with like-minded people.
Portable speakers are almost the complete opposite, broadcasting your tunes to anyone within range and sharing them with whoever might be willing to listen. It turns music into a social activity, one that can help create and strengthen bonds. This speaker concept is almost a tongue-in-cheek jab at headphones by applying their standard silhouette to a speaker and giving a unique industrial aesthetic.
Designers: Sihyun Choi, Seongyeop Jeon














Most portable wireless speakers use a single-body design to bring around in a bag or vehicle. They aren’t always the easiest to carry around, however, though some designs are now adding carrying straps for that very purpose. This design concept, in contrast, is all about being carried in your hand, and it takes inspiration from that more portable audio equipment many carry around all the time.



At first glance, you almost think you’re seeing an extra large pair of headphones because of the conventional design of having two speakers joined by some arching structure. In this case, however, those speakers are oddly blocky and the arch is more of an angled bar. The large size is, of course, due to the fact that these are actually wireless speakers with dual drivers, and it isn’t shy about announcing that to the world.



The W-YZ portable speaker adopts an aesthetic that is reminiscent of the style of teenage engineering, blending industrial style with minimalism to great success. It utilizes clean lines and sharp edges to draw a striking figure, while surfaces are mostly barren except for essential labels. The handle is a simple metal tube bent at right angles, and carrying this design is almost similar to how people used to carry portable speakers in the 80s.

Unlike those old speakers, however, W-YZ’s two drivers are truly independent, and you can turn them around any which way to send the music in the exact direction you want. It’s definitely an intriguing design, one that defies conventions in the portable speaker market. Whether it’s a practical design as far as portability goes is still an open question, but it will definitely be quite the head-turner if you bring it in public spaces.

""Was an enormous pleasure to work with my American coworkers who join me in this sad culling,"" wrote former level designer Jack Burrows on Tuesday. ""Just couldn't dodge that big boot I guess, no matter how big the success of the gig.""
Marvel Rivals has been developed and maintained by development teams across the U.S. and China. The exact scale of the layoffs today are unclear at the moment, but the Chinese side of the development team will presumably be handling the entirety of the game's support moving forward.
Marvel Rivals first launched as a free-to-play title in December 2024, with the game rapidly becoming one of the top five most played titles in the U.S. across Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam, per Circana executive director Mat Piscatella. The game is currently in the middle of its first season, which is introducing the Fantastic Four as playable characters. The success of Marvel Rivals has also brought serious competition for Blizzard Entertainment's Overwatch 2, with Blizzard implementing a number of upcoming changes to try and regain momentum.
This also comes as NetEase Games has been pulling out of funding a number of North American game development teams that it was previously backing, including Humanoid Origin and Worlds Untold, teams founded by BioWare veterans Casey Hudson and Mac Walters, respectively.
Just a short while ago, I opined that it was great to see Marvel Rivals be a huge success, given the current state of the gaming industry. The fact that a new live service game could break in and capture a slice of the market was exciting, especially after the unfortunate failure of a number of titles over the last couple of years.
It's hard (if not downright laughable) to imagine the game isn't hitting some imaginary targets for success. I'm confident that the revenue from some of the skins for Invisible Woman and Psylocke outgrossed many entire games from last year.

Looking at this, it's tough to watch unfold, and even more confusing to try and make and kind of sense of it. As always, my thoughts are with those affected.

92,2025-02-18,"David Fortunato has worked at Wealthfront for 16 years and was named CEO in 2021.
T
he stock market has never been higher, but that doesn’t mean it’s an easy time to start a fintech aimed at investors.
In an industry saturated with legacy players like Vanguard, Fidelity, BlackRock and Charles Schwab that offer easy access to funds for retail investors with minuscule management fees, it’s difficult to scale fast enough to offer a product to retail investors at a competitive price.
It wasn’t always so. Forbes put Robinhood on our very first Fintech 50 list in 2015. Back then, the startup was catalyzing the race to the bottom in fees by offering commission-free trading. (Its business instead relies on the controversial practice of payment for order flow from the market makers who execute its clients’ trades.) The now-public Robinhood had a phenomenal year. Its stock has quadrupled since the start of 2024, fueled by three consecutive quarters with a net profit of at least $150 million. Its assets under custody at the end of November were $195 billion, up 106% year-over-year.
We’re still searching for the next Robinhood. Just two firms were selected for this year’s Fintech 50 in the investing category, making way for more up-and-comers in other areas like payments and personal finance. That meant dropping a few multi-time list members like iCapital, a longtime mainstay which partners with financial advisors to expand access to alternative investments and crossed $200 billion in assets invested through its platform last year, but with a growth rate now more indicative of a maturing business than an early-stage rocket ship.
One exception to the rule, Wealthfront, which was founded in 2008, made the first Fintech 50 list in 2015 and then dropped off until 2024. It’s been growing too fast to ignore. With $80 billion in assets under management, up from $55 billion a year ago, it has left every other new-age robo-advisor in the dust. Its revenue grew 46% last year and has soared 260% in a two-year span, from $80 million in 2022 to $289 million in 2024. It charges a 0.25% management fee and also earns some interest on customers’ cash deposits and loans it extends.
The lone other investing startup on the list, Capitalize, is appearing for the second straight year after raising a $19 million Series B round in August. Capitalize simplifies the task of tracking down and rolling over old 401(k) accounts, a useful service given the growing prevalence of workplace retirement savings accounts, even if job-hopping has slowed from its frenzied pace in 2022. Capitalize is free for individual users and generates revenue by charging IRA providers like Robinhood, SoFi or Schwab for facilitating asset transfers onto their platforms.
Headquarters: New York, New York.
Capitalize helps users track down and combine old 401(k) accounts—the company estimates there’s $1.65 trillion in unclaimed retirement assets out there—into a rollover IRA at one of its partners, which include Schwab, SoFi and Betterment. It replaces the tedious process of phone calls and paperwork with a simple online experience and also serves financial institutions, which can integrate Capitalize’s software to handle rollovers for their clients. In 2024, the company added Ellevest and M1 to its roster of rollover IRA partners and raised $19 million in Series B funding.
Funding: $35 million from RRE, Canapi and Walkabout, among others.
Bona fides: Increased annualized rollover volume on the platform in 2024 to $3 billion from $750 million the year before.
Cofounders: CEO Gaurav Sharma, 40, a veteran of hedge fund Greenlight Capital, JPMorgan’s Highbridge and UBS; CTO Christopher Phillips, 49, who was CTO for IAC’s Applications Group.
Headquarters: Palo Alto, California.
Wealthfront is a profitable robo-advisor with $80 billion in assets under management in prepackaged stock and bond portfolios and cash accounts currently yielding 4% interest. Its $289 million in revenue comes from the 0.25% management fee it charges, interest on customers’ cash deposits it earns from partner banks and interest from loans it makes, among other business lines. In May 2024, it introduced an automated bond ladder for users offering a portfolio of U.S. Treasuries, which are exempt from state income taxes, with bonds maturing at different dates to provide steady income. That product now yields over 4.1%, net of the management fee.
Funding: $230 million from Tiger Global Management, Index Ventures and Spark Capital, among others.
Latest valuation: $1.4 billion.
Date of last valuation: September 2022.
Bona fides: Revenue grew 46% in 2024 to $289 million; user base increased to 1.1 million from 750,000.
Cofounders: Chairman Andy Rachleff, 66, who also cofounded venture capital firm Benchmark; chief strategy officer Dan Carroll, 43.
CEO: David Fortunato, 39, an Amherst College alum who was Wealthfront’s CTO for a decade and took over from Rachleff in 2021.

UK retailer GAME appears to have dropped its widely-criticised delivery fee for in-demand Pokémon Prismatic Evolutions card sets, which saw £11 tins cost £31 to get delivered.


Exasperated GAME staff told Eurogamer last week that the chain's inflated postage pricing was a deliberate move, rather than a simple mistake. Employees also told us they were tired of Pokémon card stock being kept back to sell for more money via GAME's website, rather than to customers visiting to try and buy the cards in-store.


The story spread online, and Eurogamer heard yesterday from a source close to the chain that GAME's ""Oversized Delivery"" fee was being reconsidered, or potentially relabelled. Today, Eurogamer has spotted that the Pokemon TCG: Scarlet & Violet Prismatic Evolutions Mini Tin no longer has its previous £19.99 ""Oversized Delivery"" option. 


That's not to say that GAME's regular options are cheap - the chain's Standard Delivery is £4.99, or you can pay the same amount just for GAME to hold the item for you in store. Alternatively, you can pay £11.99 to get the cards via Next Day Delivery by DPD, or £9.99 to chance it with Next Day Delivery by Evri. 


But these are, at least, now GAME's usual rates.


Eurogamer previously contacted GAME to ask why a small tin of Pokémon cards no bigger than a mobile phone required a £19.99 ""Oversized Delivery"" option, when a PlayStation 5 Pro console did not. Eurogamer is still waiting for a response.


Last year, Eurogamer reported on GAME's various ongoing issues as it is further integrated into Sports Direct's Fraser Group, and suffers store closures, redundancies, and stock problems.

96,2025-02-18,"The Trump administration’s push to have TSMC buy Intel’s chipmaking operations faces a major barrier: The Taiwanese firm isn’t actually interested, and even the threat of tariffs probably won’t be enough to force a deal.
“TSMC (TSM-0.93%) has stated very clearly that it has no interest in taking a stake in Intel (INTC-5.91%), and running Intel’s fabs alone or in a [joint venture] would be equally unenticing,” Tim Culpan, founder of the media outlet Culpium and a long-time journalist tracking the chip industry from Taiwan, told Quartz.
Intel stock surged 16% Tuesday on reports that TSMC and Broadcom (AVGO-0.56%) could each buy different parts of the company. The stock has rallied to start 2025.
But TSMC’s leadership is a product of its culture, which probably wouldn’t mesh well with Intel’s, Culpan said.
“Intel didn’t fall behind because of a lack of funds or equipment,” he said. “It fell behind because of successive internal failures related to its approach to technological and business development.”
TSMC is a foundry that makes semiconductors designed by its clients, not its own chips. So it likes to be neutral, both politically and among its clients and its suppliers. That would be more difficult if it ran the operations of a chip-design firm like Intel.
Additionally, a joint venture with Intel would focus on advanced semiconductor technology, so TSMC’s advantage could be jeopardized by leaks, the Taipei Times reported last week, citing Liu Pei-chen, a researcher at the Taiwan Industry Economics Database of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research.
President Donald Trump’s commitment to prioritizing U.S. interests may also put the firm at a disadvantage, Liu told the newspaper. He said the combined risks from a potential deal are great enough that TSMC would do better to accept American tariffs. Its technological edge gives it enough bargaining power to allow it to pass the added costs along to buyers.
“It feels like the Trump administration is being poorly advised by people pushing their own agenda, not necessarily what’s best for the U.S.,” Culpan said. 
It’s a similar approach to President Joe Biden’s but more forceful — and could jeopardize American access to the world’s best chips.
“The best solution for everyone,” Culpan said, “would be for TSMC to announce an expansion in Arizona, agree to make more chips for Intel and other U.S. companies, and boost cooperation in packaging, which is crucial to AI.”
Any eventual resolution between TSMC and the U.S government can be expected “to involve mutual concessions, ensuring that TSMC derives some strategic or economic benefit,” said Moon Surana, a portfolio manager at Harding Loevner, which owns the stock in its global equity strategy.
“Historically, the company has prioritized long-term customer relationships and sustainable value creation over the pursuit of monopolistic pricing power,” she told Quartz. “A similarly balanced outcome is anticipated in this case.”

Huawei Android Tablets Headphones Smart wearables

Today is the day that the Huawei Mate XT Ultimate goes global with a launch event in Kuala Lumpur. Also in attendance are the 2025 refresh of the MatePad Pro 13.2, plus two new accessories – Huawei’s first hooked earbuds and its latest smart band.
Huawei is crushing the competition in China’s foldable market and now its most advanced product is ready to expand to new markets. The Mate XT Ultimate is the thinnest foldable yet (measuring 3.6mm in its unfolded state, not counting the camera island). And it’s the largest foldable that compacts down to smartphone size – its 10.2” display is covered with 322cm² of ultra-thin glass (UTG).



Huawei Mate XT Ultimate
The phone borrows its 50MP main camera from the Pura 70 Pro – it has a variable aperture that can be adjusted in 10 steps from f/1.4 to f/4.0. Also on board are a 125mm periscope (12MP sensor) and a 12MP ultra-wide. Check out our hands-on review for more details on the Huawei Mate XT Ultimate.



Huawei Mate XT Ultimate
Huawei is developing other aspects of display technology too – the Huawei MatePad Pro 13.2 (2025), introduced in China back in November, has a 13.2” OLED PaperMatte Display. PaperMatte is a nano-level etching technology that creates an anti-glare layer on the glass, which reduces light interference by 97%.



Huawei MatePad Pro 13.2 (2025)
The display can hit 1,000 nits, but with the reduced glare, it won’t need to go that high as often as a typical tablet. The MatePad can optionally be paired with the Smart Magnetic Keyboard for a laptop-like experience. The software includes Huawei Notes and the advanced drawing app GoPaint. The 10,100mAh battery supports Huawei’s SuperCharge tech and can be fully recharged in 65 minutes.



Huawei MatePad Pro 13.2 (2025)
The Huawei FreeArc are the company’s first open-ear buds with ear hooks. These are designed for comfort and stability, even during exercise. They are also suitable for outdoor sports with an IP57 rating, which is more than enough to survive rain.
The buds feature 17 x 12mm drivers, a symmetrical acoustic structure and a dynamic bass algorithm.



Huawei FreeArc
Finally, the Huawei Band 10 focuses on two key features: the Enhanced Sleep Health Assistant and the Emotional Wellbeing Assistant. The former tracks your sleep, shows you a summary of your sleep patterns (including heart rate variability data) and offers suggestions on how to improve the quality of your sleep. The latter monitors physiological changes by collecting real-time health data.
The global price of Huawei Mate XT Ultimate is set at €3,499, and it will come with 16 GB RAM and 1 TB storage. Details on the availability and pricing of the tablet, and the new smart band will be announced soon, while the FreeArc are set at £99/€119.
