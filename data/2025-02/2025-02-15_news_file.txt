The virtual courtside seats are available to NBA League Pass subscribers only.

The NBA has introduced a new AR feature for its Vision Pro app this week called Tabletop, which places a floating render of a basketball court in your space during “select” live games, according to an NBA help page describing the feature. On the court, digital avatars mirror the game’s actual players as they move, pass, and shoot — but only for live games that you can watch or listen to with NBA League Pass.
The feature even works for local market games that are otherwise unavailable to stream video of in the app. It was about 45 seconds behind the announcer audio during a local game I tested it with, but Vision Pro owner Justin Ryan reported about a half-second delay after using a toolbar option to sync with the live feed. The feature wasn’t available for any out-of-market games when I tested, so I only had an audio feed to compare with.
Each player has the same avatar (shown as either a robot or with a cell-shaded cartoon style), but you can still differentiate by the color of their jerseys and the names and numbers emblazoned on them. Their name is also placed above their head when they have the ball. The NBA didn’t immediately respond when I asked whether the feature will be available for this weekend’s NBA All-Star events. Here’s a screen recording of the feature from my own Vision Pro, followed by a timestamped link to the same moment from a highlights reel the NBA posted after the game:
The feature is reminiscent of what the Lapz Vision Pro app did for Formula 1 races before it was shut down by F1 itself. If you subscribe to NBA League Pass and have a Vision Pro, look for a new Tabletop button next to the usual “Watch Live” and “Multiview” buttons in the NBA app.
Tabletop was surprisingly polished for an alpha feature when I tried it out. The NBA has shown off mixed reality tech it’s experimenting with in the past, such as the above presentation from NBA commissioner Adam Silver in which he demonstrates using a 3D scan of sports commentator Ahmad Rashad to replace a player in an in-game clip.

2,2025-02-15,"Linda Koistinen and her husband Dale stood outside a Tesla dealership in Berkeley, California, on Saturday, protesting.
They were not there to take aim at the company's electric vehicles, but the person behind Tesla - Elon Musk - and join with others who are upset at the world's richest man's work to disrupt and take apart large portions of the US government.
""It's a place where we can make a visible stand against him personally,"" Ms Koistinen   told the BBC. ""He should not be deciding the fate of our democracy by disassembling our government piece by piece. It's not right.""
As part of an effort organizers dubbed #TeslaTakeover, clutches of protesters across the country gathered outside the company's showrooms, having largely planned when to meet and where on the social media platform Bluesky, an upstart competitor to Musk-owned X, formerly Twitter.
In some places, those protests barely numbered a dozen, with people in Washington DC, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh and Lyndhurst, Ohio, stamping their feet to stay warm amid snow and cold weather. Some held signs that read ""Say no to Doge"" and ""Deport Musk"".
The protest in Berkeley - a top California city for electric car ownership - numbered 200.
As part of his White House-backed effort called Doge, for Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has been sending teams into government agencies to comb through data and pushing for massive spending cuts as well as ""clawbacks"" of money already spent. 
President Donald Trump, who received an historic amount of campaign donations from Musk, is on the same page, freezing hiring as well as laying off thousands of federal employees.
Musk says he has uncovered wasteful spending and his work is aimed at making the government operate more smoothly. But to many, he is stopping the government from functioning while making decisions that should be left to elected leaders and accessing private information.
""It's just really grinding on the mind,""  said Dale Koistinen. ""I'm 84 years old. This is unbelievable. This is a takeover of our government.""
Along with X, Musk also is the primary owner SpaceX, Neuralink and the Boring Company. But it is Tesla he is most known for and Tesla is where people unhappy with his Doge work are taking out their anger.
For days, concerned Americans have been asking fellow citizens to dump their Tesla stock and sell their Tesla vehicles.
Singer-songwriter Sheryl Crow posted a video to Instagram that showed her Tesla being towed away.
""There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with,"" she wrote in the caption. ""So long Tesla.""
Crow added that she was donating proceeds from the car's sale to National Public Radio in the U.S., a frequent target of Musk's ire.
Tesla stock surged following Donald Trump's election in November. Musk contributed a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump's re-election effort, and hit the trail on Trump's behalf in the final days of the campaign.
But after touching an all-time high in December, the company's shares have shed 30% of their value with a pronounced selloff since Trump was inaugurated last month.
Saturday's protests were promoted by prominent disinformation researcher Joan Donovan and the actor Alex Winter, who played Bill in the 80s movie ""Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure."" 
Teah Jackson, though, noticed the Berkeley protest during an outing with her girlfriend, and stopped to show her support.
""It's hopeful,"" Jackson told the BBC. ""It's an acknowledgement that people aren't going to go down without a fight and that they're going to continue to push for what they believe in.""
The billionaire boss of X (formerly Twitter), Tesla and SpaceX is a controversial figure.
Safety regulators launched the investigation after reports of crashes involving the feature, which allows drivers to summon parked cars. 
Officials still do not know why a US Army soldier drove the Tesla more than 800 miles from Colorado to Las Vegas.
The BBC's Lily Jamali reports from outside the Trump International Hotel where the explosion took place.
Tesla's ranking as the world's top electric vehicle seller is threatened after sales fell last year.

On TeslaTakedown.com, citizens are planning protests at Tesla locations across the country (and world) in hopes of tying negative sentiment about CEO Elon Musk’s DOGE activities to the company’s stock price.

BY Adele Peters5 minute readShare
Last Monday, inspired by reading about a small protest of Elon Musk and DOGE that happened at a Tesla charging station in Maine, Joan Donovan decided to make a digital flyer inviting people to join her at a protest this weekend at a Tesla showroom in Boston. Days later, the idea has grown organically into more than three dozen protests at Tesla showrooms across the country.
“It struck me that there are Tesla dealerships and charging stations across the nation, and this is a point of leverage that many people can access, rather than having to go to your state capital,” says Donovan, a professor at Boston University who says she is acting in her capacity as a citizen. “This is a place in which we can make a difference.”
Through DOGE, or the “Department of Government Efficiency”—which is not an official government agency—Musk gave his team access to private taxpayer data and classified information. He’s forced the virtual shutdown of the U.S. Agency for International Development, freezing lifesaving programs that were delivering HIV drugs, oxygen, and other medical aid to various communities around the world. He’s actively dismantling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency that would have regulated his plans to set up a new payment service at X. He’s pushed federal workers out of their jobs. Much or all of the work is likely illegal, and multiple court cases are underway.
A website, TeslaTakedown, lets anyone set up a local DOGE protest, many of which will happen on February 15. (It also calls for anyone who owns Tesla stock or cars to sell.) 
|
“Often, with these types of initiatives, it takes weeks to plan,” says Alex Winter, a documentarian known for making The Panama Papers and other films, who happened to know Donovan and helped amplify the idea. “In this case, we did it in a week. At the end of the day, the central organizer on this is the public—we’re giving them a place to organize. These are individuals across the country who are protesting en masse at these showrooms.” When we spoke on Friday afternoon, 39 events were planned, and the number was growing.
A handful of other protests have already happened at Tesla locations, from Manhattan to Seattle. The efforts might seem, at first, to be small. But in theory, the pressure on Tesla could succeed. “It is possible to get results this way,” says Edward Niedermeyer, author of Ludicrous: The Unvarnished Story of Tesla Motors. “There’s a path to putting a considerable amount of pressure on Musk, personally.”
Tesla car sales are already struggling. In 2024, Tesla sales were essentially flat, dropping 1.1% from the year before after years of growth, despite the fact that the company slashed prices. In China, with a vast array of newer, arguably more innovative options for electric vehicles, fewer consumers are buying Teslas. Sales have also fallen in Europe, driven in part by Musk’s unpopularity.
In the U.K., where Musk has argued that the prime minister should be jailed and America should “liberate” the British people from their “tyrannical” government, one survey found that 60% of likely EV buyers no longer want a Tesla because of Musk’s politics. In Germany, Musk’s support for the far-right Alternative for Germany party, and the fact that he appeared to use a Nazi salute during Trump’s inauguration, presumably contributed to a 59% drop in year-over-year sales in January. Tesla sales also fell in France, Sweden, and Norway last month. Some Tesla owners, both in Europe and the U.S., are either selling their cars or adding apology bumper stickers.
Musk, and Tesla investors, say that the real value of the company is in its future promise of full self-driving tech. But Musk has been teasing its imminent release for years. The only real business that Tesla has now is its EV business, and with more competitors in the space, it’s not doing well. The Cybertruck, Tesla’s first all-new vehicle since 2017, is “the biggest flop in the auto industry,” Niedermeyer says.
That creates an opening for a Tesla boycott in the U.S. “The unique opportunity that American consumers have is if we can collectively affect a dramatic reduction in sales here, that pushes volume down, that pushes margin down,” Niedermeyer says. “At this tipping point, the core business that generates 90% of revenue could turn into a negative-margin business, which means that no matter how many sales they do, they lose money on every car.”
Eventually, it’s possible that the psychology around the company’s arguably overinflated stock price could shift. With a bubble stock, “as long as people prop it up, it’s great,” he says. “The problem is once the psychology shifts from greed to fear and people start selling.” Musk’s cash loans are secured by Tesla stock, so at some point, he’ll have to sell stock to cover margin calls—which is likely to convince many more people to sell and create a downward spiral, Niedermeyer says.
There’s no evidence yet that Musk is worried about what’s happening at Tesla. But employees and many investors are concerned, according to a Washington Post story. Musk “has inflicted a massive amount of damage on the perception of that company,” Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, told the Post, saying that she donated most of her Tesla stock to charity in 2024. (Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment.)
It’s not clear how quickly pressure against Tesla could make a difference—or exactly how much harm Musk can inflict on the government while lawsuits make their way through the courts. But in addition to impacts on Tesla, the protests can help raise awareness of what’s happening now in D.C. 
“DOGE has done so much damage already to government agencies, particularly ones that were investigating Musk’s companies for wrongdoing,” says Donovan, the university professor organizing a Tesla protest in Boston. “And so if the government’s not going to call attention to these conflicts of interest, then hopefully the people will.” She says the protests are also a way to show support for federal workers who are being pushed to leave their jobs.
Winter, the documentarian, says he has multiple motivations for protesting. “There is an end-game desire to devalue the stock and end up with a vote of no confidence [on] Musk from the shareholders, which would absolutely impact him in a meaningful way,” he says. “An enormous amount of his value is tied up in his stake of Tesla.”
In addition, Winter says, “There’s an enormous need for greater literacy and understanding in the country and the world about these tech oligarchs. It’s something I’ve been working on for decades, which is to demystify this notion that they’re invulnerable and all-powerful.”
Protests “are extremely effective, and educating oneself is extremely effective,” he says. “And, I would argue, [these efforts] minimize hopelessness. Because the more specifics you understand about Musk and his wealth—and the vulnerability of his wealth—and the more you understand about what powers people do and don’t have, the more you realize there’s a path forward.”

5,2025-02-15,"The U.S. government is looking to shift from TSMC as a major supplier of the nation’s technological components to relying on parts made by American companies.
The company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd is one of the premier component suppliers in the world. It particularly partners with many U.S. brands, using its ever-advancing manufacturing processes to build the semiconductors that power many of the electronics that we use today, from brands such as Apple. However, the Trump Administration is adamant about pushing forward a “Made In USA” ethos when it comes to developing products moving forward.
DIGITIMES: Three proposals the United States has presented to TSMC.
1. TSMC would build an advanced packaging facility in the US, offering integrated services from wafer manufacturing to backend processing locally.2. Under a joint venture (JV) proposed by the US government,…
&mdash; Jukanlosreve (@Jukanlosreve) February 13, 2025
Tech informant, @Jukanlosreve detailed; referencing the Taiwanese publication DigiTimes, that the U.S. government has given TSMC three alternatives to retain business within the country. Ultimately, the plan would meld TSMC from an international corporation to one with the U.S. as its domestic home base, in addition to assisting the U.S.-founded Intel Foundry in gaining traction in the industry.
The first option proposes that TSMC establish a packaging facility stateside. This would be a major step toward the U.S.’ aim of not having to rely on international resources. However, TSMC has already been slow to consider this option due to “labor shortages and low-profit margins,” Jukanlosreve noted.
The second option proposes a joint venture between TSMC and Intel Foundry, in which TSMC and other companies would invest in Intel financially, and there could be a potential technology transfer of TSMC’s company and intellectual property. The Taiwanese manufacturer is strongly against this option as it could take TSMC out of the semiconductor market, potentially to put Intel Foundry in its place. Wccftech noted that TSMC and Intel use different manufacturing technologies, suggesting a refreshed Intel would need to develop a new manufacturing process.
The third option proposes that Intel Foundry move forward as the main supplier for all U.S. partners. Once again, this option puts TSMC at risk of losing, not only its customers but its mainstay in the industry.
This news among various reports sent Intel stock up in recent days, with shares trading at 29.2% on Thursday and seeing a four-day positive streak, according to Dow Jones Market Data.
The spike came after Vice President J.D. Vance spoke at an artificial intelligence summit in Paris earlier this week, about bringing semiconductor manufacturing to the U.S. being an important goal of the new administration. He noted that Intel stood to benefit from any plans the government has given it is the country’s largest chip manufacturer, according to Market Watch.
Also noting the speculation of the government proposing a joint venture between TSMC and Intel’s foundry business, some analysts believe the Trump administration will continue to promote the U.S. Chips Act so it can get its plans of funding and building U.S.-based chip plants in action.
They add that Intel Foundry has positives and negatives. Once part of Intel’s hardware business, it was eventually separated into its own entity. While it has yet to sign on any major customers, it is one of the only U.S. semiconductor manufacturers that produces chips domestically, according to TechInsights vice chair, G. Dan Hutcheson.
The industry has heard speculations of the government’s plans; however, it is also privy to both Intel and TSMC’s upcoming manufacturing processes; with Intel’s being the 18a and TSMC the 2nm, or two-nanometer process. Analysts including TechInsight’s, Scotten Jones have compared the two processes and determined that Intel’s 18a performed better.
While all the reports remain speculative, the spotlight will certainly now be on both Intel and TSMC. Outside of any government plans, reports indicate that both companies are working on releasing their next-generation technologies within the next year. Intel’s 18a process is expected to become available for mass production starting in mid-2025 when the brand starts manufacturing it’s Core Ultra 3-series ‘Panther Lake’ processors. Meanwhile, TSMC’s 2nm process is expected to enter mass production by mid-2026.
Intel may be making some major changes to the architecture of its upcoming Meteor Lake chips, industry sources say. This could potentially give Intel an edge over competitors such as Apple.
According to a new report from DigiTimes, Intel may switch from using its own 7nm process node to TSMC's 5nm.
A Chinese national was recently caught entering China with 160 Intel processors strapped to his body, an act that customs officials amount to smuggling. The China Customs office stated that it had found Intel's 11th Gen and the latest 12th Gen Alder Lake models strapped to the man's abdomen, waist, and legs.
Since none of the items were declared, the smuggling could be part of a tax-evasion scheme to avoid import tariffs on computer components.
Intel has announced its fourth-quarter earnings report for 2021, confirming that despite a chip shortage and supply constraints, Team Blue experienced its best financial year ever.
Revenue during the fourth quarter totaled $19.5 billion, which represents Intel’s highest financial quarter in the company’s history and a year-over-year increase of 4%. It also exceeded analysts’ expectations of $18.3 billion.

6,2025-02-15,"For the final 15km (9.3 miles) of the journey from Toulouse to the hamlet of Les Pequiès, you travel on narrow winding roads through hilly, dense woodlands. Without a reliable GPS system you can get lost very quickly, especially at night.
I expected the home of Andrew and Dawn Searle, the British couple found dead earlier this month, to be remote. That's the suggestion from the photos of the crime scene I had seen. But I was surprised when I arrived to find it well within shouting distance of several homes.
It's an important detail because Dawn's partly naked body was discovered outside the front of the house on Thursday morning last week. The prosecutor in charge of the case, Nicolas Rigot-Muller, said she had severe head wounds caused by a blunt weapon. Any screams would have been heard very clearly by neighbours.
Her husband's body was found hanging inside the back of the house. The prosecutor says no weapon has been found, that there's no obvious sign of a burglary nor evidence that Andrew put up a fight, nor of a sex crime.
A friend discovered Dawn's body when she came around to the house with her dog. The couple had two big dogs of their own, and they often walked with the friend or several other dog owners I talked to in the quiet hamlet.
One woman, Bénédicte, said the couple were ""absolutely adorable, we would often meet like this simply walking our dogs around the village"".
""We are very shocked, of course we are,"" she said.
Lydie, a butcher, sells her produce at local markets with her husband. Their property overlooks the Searle's home, just a fallow field separates them.
""They were a great couple who smiled a lot and since I once lived in England I was able to talk to them in English,"" she told me. ""They were well integrated and every year invited everyone over for a party.""
But not everyone I approached wanted to talk. Their looks give away that this is a very difficult moment for this rural community in the glare of a criminal investigation.
The railroad crossing next to the village doesn't have safety barriers, just a stop sign, which tells you how little traffic there is here normally. Now, you can feel the presence of the Gendarmerie, the branch of the French military which is leading the investigation.
While I was providing live coverage for BBC Scotland a large car with tinted windows drove past me slowly, inside four stony-faced officers from the Toulouse homicide and organised crime branch.
There is no question locals are scared. Several officers from the Gendarmerie photographed our car and asked to see our ID cards and urged us to be discreet. They said the residents were frightened and that their presence was partly to reassure them.
There is bright yellow Gendarmerie tape strapped to the front gate of the Searle's home. The dogs are gone and their swimming pool has a cover over it. Two large candles have been lit in the driveway and a leaflet taped to the gate has a phone number for anyone who feels they need psychological counselling or moral support, provided by local social services. The same leaflet has been taped to a community board in the centre of the hamlet.
The Searle couple retired to this region five years ago, and other mailboxes in the hamlet indicate they are not the only expatriates in the region. This isn't surprising: there are no official statistics but in the time I have been based in Toulouse, Foreign Office staff have told me at various times they believe around 30,000 Brits live full-time in the south west, making it the biggest British expat population in France outside of Paris.
On top of that tens of thousands more have holiday homes in this region, called Occitanie, which is one of the fastest growing areas of France, attracting people from not just the UK but Belgium, the Netherlands and Paris.
What attracts them here is the quality of life, wide open spaces, relatively cheap property and achingly beautiful countryside and architecture. 
The nearby town of Villefranche-de-Rouergue has one of the most beautiful medieval stone arcade-lined central squares in a region teeming with them. In summer, an open-air market in the square is crammed with holiday makers, including many Brits, carrying woven baskets filled with local produce.
Various conspiracy theories circulate about how the couple died – I've been asked about them by countless French national TV and radio media outlets. But all we know for sure is that the prosecutor and his team are still trying to determine, as he reiterated to me on Wednesday night, ""whether the tragedy resulted from a domestic crime followed by suicide or involved a third party"".
Ever since the deaths I've been speaking to the prosecutor leading the case, who revealed to me late this week that he was handing over the investigation to a senior judge in Montpellier with more resources available.
I asked him if that means he was leaning towards the idea that the Searle couple were both murdered.
He replied that he was not ruling anything out. He added that if they were murdered, and it goes to trial, he would lead the prosecution.
Dr Remy Sevigne, the psychologist who answers the counselling hotline from the leaflets, told me that so far around a dozen people had called him for some sort of support. They were all local, he said, and all knew the couple personally.
They were all either frightened or in shock, he said.

The Dating Apps Reporting Project is an 18-month investigation. It was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Centerâs AI Accountability Network and The Markup, now a part of CalMatters, and copublished with The Guardian and The 19th.Â 
When a young woman in Denver met up with a smiling cardiologist she matched with on the dating app Hinge, she had no way of knowing that the company behind the app had already received reports from two other women who accused him of rape.
She met the 34-year-old doctor with green eyes and thinning hair at Highland Tap & Burger, a sports bar in a trendy neighborhood. It went well enough that she accepted an invitation to go back to his apartment. As she emerged from his bathroom, he handed her a tequila soda.
What transpired over the next 24 hours, according to court testimony, reads like every personâs dating app nightmare.
After sipping the drink, the woman started to lose control. Her memory blurred. She fell to the ground, and the man started to film her. He put her in a headlock, kissing her forehead; she struggled to free herself but managed to grab her things and leave. He followed her out the door, holding her shoes and trying to force her back inside, but she was able to call an Uber, vomiting in the car on the way home.
She woke up at home, soaking wet on her bathroom floor, the key to her house still in her door. She continued vomiting for hours. When she came to, she reported the assault to Hinge.
Hinge is one of more than a dozen dating apps owned by Match Group. The $8.5 billion global conglomerate also owns brands like Tinder (the worldâs most popular dating app), OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish. Match Group controls half of the worldâs online dating market, operates in 190 countries, and facilitates meetups for millions of people.
Match Groupâs official safety policy states that when a user is reported for assault, âall accounts found that are associated with that user will be banned from our platforms.â
So why, on the night of Jan. 25, 2023, was Stephen Matthews still on the app? Just four days before, Match Group had been alerted when another woman reported him for rape. A little more than a week later, he was reported for rape again. This time, the survivor went to the police.
None of these women knew that the company had known about his violent behavior for years. He was first reported on Sept. 28, 2020. By then, Match Groupâs safety policy was already in place.
Even after a police report, it took nearly two months for Matthews to be arrested â the only thing that got him off the apps. By then, at least 15 women would eventually report that Matthews had raped or drugged them. Nearly every one of them had met him on dating apps run by Match Group.
On Oct. 25, 2024, a Denver judge sentenced Matthews to 158 years to life in prison after a jury convicted him of 35 counts related to drugging and sexually assaulting eight women, drugging two women, and assaulting one more for a total of 11 women. Attorneys for the women said much of that violence could have been prevented.
“It is shocking that for years after receiving reports of sexual assault, Hinge continued to allow Stephen Matthews access to its platforms and actively facilitated his abuse,â said Laura Wolf, the attorney representing the woman whose police report led to the arrest. Following best practices forÂ reporting on sexual assault, the Dating Apps Reporting Project is honoring survivorsâ requests for anonymity.Â Matthewsâ attorney, Douglas Cohen, declined to comment. A letter that The Dating Apps Reporting Project sent directly to Matthews in jail went unanswered.
Match Groupâs reach is so massive â its mission is âto spark meaningful connections for every single person worldwideâ â that people are more likely to meet through its apps than out at the bars, at church, or through friends.
But Matthews’ case shows that even as these apps have made it easier for us to connect with a seemingly endless pool of potential lovers, they have also made it easier for people who commit sexual abuse to reach a seemingly endless number of potential targets.
In 2022, a team of researchers at Brigham Young University published an analysis of hundreds of sexual assaults in Utah. They found attacks facilitated by dating apps happened faster and were more violent than when the perpetrator met the victim through other means. They also found that perpetrators who use dating apps are more likely to target vulnerable people. Almost 60 percent of sexual assault survivors self-reported a mental illness.
Match Group has known for years which users have been reported for drugging, assaulting, or raping their dates since at least 2016, according to internal company documents. Since 2019, Match Groupâs central database has recorded every user reported for rape and assault across its entire suite of apps; by 2022, the system, known as Sentinel, was collecting hundreds of troubling incidents every week, company insiders say.
Match Group promised in 2020 that it would release whatâs known as a transparency report â a public document that would reveal data on harm occurring on and off its platforms. If the public were aware of the scale of rape and assault on Match Group apps, they would be able to accurately assess their risk. As of February 2025, the report has not been released.
Instead, as people continued to get hurt, the company dithered over what damning information should be hidden. âDo we only publish where we are required by law?â reads a slide in a 2021 presentation shown multiple times to Match Group employees as well as external safety partners. âDo we push back on how much we are required to reveal, or do we try to go beyond what is required?â
No online space is risk-free. But while Match Group has long possessed the tools, financial resources, and investigative procedures necessary to make it harder for bad actors to resurface, internal documents show the company has resisted efforts to spread them across its apps, in part because safety protocols could stall corporate growth.
âThe obsession with metrics and having to stick with them is frustrating and potentially dangerous,â one employee wrote in 2021 after the company learned that the investigative news nonprofit ProPublica was planning a story. âThis is not the way we were meant to work and peopleâs lives are at risk.â
The same person asked their superiors: ââHow much would you personally pay to stop just one person being sexually assaulted by a date, one child being trafficked or one vulnerable person being driven to suicide by a predator?â I feel that if I asked members of our staff that question individually, they would put a high value of their own money on it – But as a group nobody is ready to hear that yet.”
Since 2021, Match Group has publicly promised to improve the safety of their products and share data, but company insiders say safety has not improved. A brief hiring spree sparked by congressional and media scrutiny has been largely scaled back, according to former employees. In 2024, the remaining employees from the central trust-and-safety team Match Group set up in response to increased scrutiny were let go and their jobs outsourced to overseas contractors. Facing pressure from Wall Street, Match Group removed CEO Bernard Kim in early February 2025 as he struggled to cut costs and end the steady decline in subscribers to Match Groupâs most powerful app, Tinder.
Members of Congress have repeatedly requested data from Match Group on sexual harm. In February 2020, 11 members of Congress wrote to then-CEO Shar Dubey asking for details on how the company responds to reports of sexual violence. In July 2023, two Democrats, then-Rep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire and Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois followed up after we inquired on the status of their efforts. The company has still not provided the data.
In September 2024, the House of Representatives passed a bill that requires consumers to be notified if they have interacted with a user on a dating app who has been banned for defrauding consumers of money or personal financial information. But the bill stopped short of addressing the issue of sexual assault on the apps, and it died in the Senate.
Our review of hundreds of pages of internal company documents, along with thousands of pages of court records, securities filings, and analyst reports, coupled with dozens of interviews with current and former employees and survivors of sexual violence found women who report being raped get no traction, while accused rapists like Stephen Matthews keep swiping â and assaulting.
Our own testing on Match Group apps shows that as of February 2025, not much has changed. Banned Tinder users, including those reported for sexual assault, can easily rejoin or move to another Match Group dating app, all while keeping most of their key personal information exactly the same.
The Dating Apps Reporting Project sent Match Group a four-page letter detailing our findings. The company responded with a short statement. The statement did not dispute that Match Group has carefully documented the extent of harm on company apps for years without sharing that information with the public. It also defended the companyâs efforts to make platforms safe.
âWe recognize our role in fostering safer communities and promoting authentic and respectful connections worldwide,â the statement provided by Kayla Whaling, senior director of communications, read. âWe will always work to invest in and improve our systems, and search for ways to help our users stay safe, both online and when they connect in real life.â
The company said it vigorously combats violence.Â âWe take every report of misconduct seriously, and vigilantly remove and block accounts that have violated our rules regarding this behavior,â its statement read. Our own testing found otherwise.
Starting in April 2024, The Dating Apps Reporting Project created a series of Tinder accounts that we subsequently reported for sexual assault. Soon after, Tinder banned the accounts, and we started investigating how easy it would be for a banned user to create new accounts.
Repeatedly, we found that users, soon after being banned, could create new Tinder accounts with the exact same name, birthday, and profile photos used on their banned accounts. Users banned from Tinder were also able to sign up for Hinge, OkCupid, and Plenty of Fish without changing those personal details.
To get around the Tinder ban, we used techniques commonly suggested by online guides and forums that donât require lots of technical knowledge to understand. We were able to verify three techniques that allowed banned Match Group users to repeatedly bypass being flagged when creating new accounts.
In its statement, Match Group cast itself as an industry leader in deploying technology to promote safety, including âharassment-preventing AI tools, ID verification for profiles, and a portal that helps us better support and communicate with law enforcement investigating crimes. â¦ Every person deserves safe and respectful experiences. We are committed to doing the work to make dating safer on our platforms and beyond,â the statement said.
Sept. 28, 2020 â the date Denver cardiologist Stephen Matthews raped a woman who reported him to Hinge â is also the date Tracey Breeden was brought on as Match Group’s head of safety and social advocacy.
Breeden was a flashy hire. âWith Tracey coming on board, we are reaffirming our commitment not just to be safety leaders in the dating space, but across the entire tech sector,â then-CEO Shar Dubey said.
Sporting a trademark black leather jacket and short, slick-backed hair, Breeden went by the nickname âTornadoâ during her 15-year career in law enforcement. What made her attractive to Match Group was her most recent job at Uber. She helped the global ride-hailing company revive its reputation after a series of scandals â from persistent reports of harassment of women employees to allegations that it was ignoring sexual assault that occurred during Uber rides.
Breeden spearheaded a safety report in 2019 that told the public what Uber knew about nearly every problem, including nationwide reports of intoxicated drivers, traffic fatalities, and incidents of sexual violence. The report became a key metric of success for the company.
In hiring Breeden, Match Group hoped to replicate this success across its portfolio of apps. “Corporations,â she said in a press release announcing her arrival, âhave a responsibility to help ensure safe experiences for their users.â
Breedenâs team garnered public attention for its new safety measures, including partnerships with NGOs, optional AI-assisted photo verification, and a law enforcement portal where police and prosecutors can request data.
She also fostered a partnership with Garbo, a startup that offered low-cost background checks. It launched on Tinder in 2022. Experts point out that background checks are not always reliable as they pull from outdated databases, and research suggests that most people who commit sexual abuse do not encounter the criminal justice system. For example, Matthews had no criminal record.
During this time, Match Group invested $100 million into safety as a recurring cost, the company said, and boasted about Breedenâs âcentral safety team.â
Her team of veteran safety professionals referred to themselves as âThe Avengers,â even donning superhero costumes at company events.
But Michael Lawrie called this âsafety theater.â
Lawrie worked for Match Group for nearly a decade, shaping and leading a safety team for one of the companyâs smaller brands, OkCupid. Sometimes working 80-hour weeks, he spent hours, even days, sniffing out savvy users who tried to thwart bans by creating multiple accounts.
Over a 30-year career in content moderation, Lawrie said, he saw many users like Stephen Matthews. âYou’re dealing with one repeat offender. I’ve dealt with god knows how many repeat offenders,â he said.
A yellow Post-it note on the side of Lawrieâs computer listed out some of his responsibilities: âRape flags. â¦ Investigate miscreants.â
These days, Lawrie is trying to start an advocacy organization for content moderators and other front-line safety workers. But, he said, heâs done with dating apps.
âI donât think theyâre safe enough at the moment,â he said. âTheyâre gonna get worse. â¦Iâm hoping dating sites vanish.â
Lawrie said he was initially excited about Breedenâs hire. He said she spent her first few months on the job talking to each brandâs safety team, and told him that she was âvery impressedâ by the work OkCupid was doing.
Each of Match Groupâs biggest apps provided their self-described strengths and weaknesses to Breedenâs team, according to an internal spreadsheet. At Hinge, these weaknesses included a âvery rudimentary warning system with no targeted comms and no follow throughâ and âno way to findâ the original profile âof a bad actor who has created multiple profiles.â
Breeden was confronted with an existential problem. âOur current ban categories wonât allow us to answer the publicâs biggest question: Am I likely to be harmed on my date?â reads a slide in a presentation drafted by her team in April 2021. While each of Match Groupâs apps had a system of reporting and banning violent users, the information was disorganized, and none of the apps talked to each other.
Lawrie hoped Breeden would improve safety at the company. But he quickly grew frustrated that neither she nor Match Group leadership listened to his pleas for what they really needed to make platforms safer: To hire trained â and expensive â investigators and integrate powerful moderation tools across all the apps.
OkCupid already had those tools. Lawrie was using them every day. One of those was the Sentinel system, which had been up and running across Match Groupâs apps for at least five years before Breeden arrived. It works like this: When a user is banned for something serious â like sexual assault â a case is created in Sentinel with the phone number and email address associated with their account. In interviews, multiple current and former employees described how those reports circulate through each of Match Groupâs apps. The system is designed to ban anyone who uses that information. It also grabs the original profileâs IP addresses, photos, and birthdate.
Such a system seems robust at first glance â but none of the Match Groupâs apps require users to provide photo identification (the kind needed to buy alcohol or board an airplane), so once a person is kicked out, they can easily start a new account with different contact information. A quick search yields scores of online forums with clear steps and suggestions for how to rejoin the apps. In addition, internal company documents show information on IP addresses, photos, and birthdate were not used to ban a user if they appear on another Match dating app.
Lawrieâs team at OkCupid knew Sentinel could only do so much.
So his team deployed other tools to fix its shortcomings, including one that could automatically ban a profile that was linked to a phone number, photo, or URL that had been previously banned â even if the user made an account with a different email or IP address. This tool was designed to be proactive rather than reactive, so that the profiles of alleged perpetrators like Matthews would not resurface after they had been reported.
Internal company documents from 2019 and 2020 show thousands of reports of âserious physical assault,â abuse, or violence on OkCupid that were deemed serious enough to get users banned from all of Match Groupâs apps. This is among the information the company kept from the public.
Breeden and Match Group leadership praised Lawrie and his team at OkCupid, he said, for their thorough investigative work and for handling some of the companyâs most difficult cases. Yet, he said, Match Group never built out a skilled, experienced investigative unit at other brands like the one he headed up at OkCupid. Under Breedenâs leadership, he said, they faced pressure to speed up investigations and train outsourced labor to use complicated moderation tools.
A week after a damning article in 2021 revealed that content moderators with little training were asked to rapidly deal with violent sexual content across Match Groupâs brands, then-CEO Dubey sent out an all-staff email addressing the controversy. She CCâd Breeden, acknowledging that the brandâs safety teams were not all on equal footing.
As Match Group prepared internally for the story to break, Lawrie was asked to write a report for Breeden outlining his teamâs accomplishments âto make sure when Tracey describes and acknowledges what you are doing individually to celebrate the good work that you are doing.â
Lawrie used that report to protest.
âMost professionals arenât judged on how many cases they can hurry through in an hour,â he wrote. The way Match Group expects its trust-and-safety and support teams to work âbasically diminishes their skills and makes them production-line workers.â Breeden declined to comment for this story, citing a nondisclosure agreement.
Lawrie left the company in 2022 and said most of his small team that was ferreting out malicious users also left due to a negative workplace environment. He said much of their work was outsourced to contractors with little training and severe quotas.
He now cautions anyone using a dating app to understand that theyâre not in the business of protecting users.
âYou’re on your own pretty much,â he said.
As Lawrie was getting pushed out of Match Group, Matthews kept appearing on the companyâs apps.
One crisp fall evening in 2022, one of the Denver cardiologistâs old medical school classmates was on Hinge when her phone screen filled up with a familiar face.
Matthews was being promoted on the app as a Standout, a popular profile that Hingeâs algorithm thinks youâll like. To match with a Standout, users must send the person a rose. They get one free rose a week, but they cost $3.99 a pop after that. His classmate did not send Matthews a rose.
By this point, Matthews had already been reported for rape at least once to Hinge. Court documents show that he had already allegedly sexually assaulted nine women and drugged 10. Not only did the apps allow him back on, they featured Matthewsâ profile.
As the COVID-19 pandemic dragged on, people got tired of forking money over for dating apps. Match Group still made a hefty profit, but its growth flatlined. Its stock cratered, losing nearly half its value between October 2021 and April 2022. That month, an analyst from J.P. Morgan wrote that the firm had received more messages about âthe underperformance of MTCH shares in recent weeks than any other topic.â
In May 2022, Match ousted Dubey and installed Bernard Kim as CEO, a former executive at the gaming company Zynga that popularized viral games like âFarmVille.â
While Dubey spoke frequently about trust and safety and worked closely with Breeden, Kim hardly mentioned safety when he began his time at Match Group, instead emphasizing the need for continued rapid expansion to drive long-term shareholder value.
Lawrie said that Kim, with his background in gaming rather than dating apps, had no interest in love. âHe just wants to make money. Heâs just there to increase profits,â Lawrie said. âIf he’s looking at a bottom line, then it’s easier to have a lawsuit than it is to provide safety. I know which one he’s gonna pick.â Match Group declined to make Bernard Kim available for an interview. Messages sent to Kim directly went unreturned.
While the tension between growth and safety exists across the tech sector, it is especially high at dating apps companies where executives have to worry about constant churn â users leaving the apps when they are no longer looking for dates. Every time Match Group delivers on its promise, it also loses customers.
In February 2024, six dating app users filed what they hope will be certified as a class action lawsuit. They argue Match Group uses âaddictiveâ features to encourage compulsive use while not leading to any real increase in off-app relationships. âThe app is designed specifically to hook them, and to keep them paying subscription fees â not to help them find love,â attorney Ryan Clarkson said. Match Group filed to dismiss the lawsuit in September, noting in its quarterly report that it âwill defend vigorouslyâ against the allegations.
Despite Kimâs efforts, Match Groupâs stock price continued to drop, and during that time, so did any mention of trust and safety. In over a year of quarterly investor calls, Kim only referenced safety efforts once.
Employees who pushed for these initiatives were forced out or laid off, including Breeden â a leader who was so convinced of her own invincibility that she showed up to an event wielding a Captain America shield.
Match Group fired its power hire in October 2022. Layoffs hit her team over the next several months. In February 2024, the remainingÂ critical investigators and law enforcement liaisons on Breedenâs central safety team were shown the door.
Lawrie said group chats of former Match Group employees have been gossipping about the cutbacks.
âYou’re not gonna see them taking safety seriously ever again,â he said, adding that the only thing that he thinks might change that is legislation.
Four months before Matthews was arrested, a post on a Facebook group in Denver blew up, right around Christmas.
Over and over again, women furiously detailed negative experiences they or their friends had with Matthews.
Some women described him as âsketchy.â Others called him âterribleâ and ânot safe.â Multiple women told a similar, dark story: that they were offered drinks, blacked out, and sexually assaulted.
The thread reached 150 comments. Two women wrote the same thing: that they had been waiting for someone to post about the cardiologist.
The flood of Facebook comments mirrored details in the police reports released the following year. Nearly all of the 16 women included in the district attorneyâs initial complaints were offered tequila. Eight recalled playing Jenga. Six mentioned a hot tub.
As these stories circulated in this small corner of the internet in December 2022, the Denver cardiologist stayed on Match Group apps.
Those fortunate enough to know about the Facebook group â and who had the foresight to check for Matthews on it â would be saved from a bad date or worse. But the fact that he could still log into Tinder and Hinge left him with a pool of thousands of unsuspecting women whom he could â and would â continue to match with.
The Dating Apps Reporting Project is aware of four additional women who have accused Matthews of drugging and/or raping them who were not part of the criminal complaint. Each of these women met Matthews on a Match Group app during a single year between the summers of 2020 and 2021.
During the years Matthews was on their apps, Match Group hired and fired Breeden. It made loud promises on sexual violence, announced initiatives and product lines, and promised a transparency report. But it was not straight with the public, which meant the women matching with Matthews on Match Group apps were not aware of the risk they faced.
Match Groupâs partnership with Garbo, the background check company, also fell apart in the summer of 2023. âItâs become clear that most online platforms arenât legitimately committed to trust and safety for their users,â Garbo wrote in a searing blog post.
After spending so much energy talking about monetization, gamification, and growth, Kim began to publicly acknowledge this problem. Speaking at the Citibank conference in the fall of 2023, he said the company was investing in new features to make sure âwomen have a good experience while they’re in the product. They feel safe. They feel secure. Etc.â
The âetc.â does not seem to include increased transparency about safety. Instead, in May 2023, Tinder released a âfemale-focused package,â a curated list of âhigh-quality profiles.â It is unclear how Tinder determines these high-quality matches. Hingeâs Standout feature, which is similar, had previously promoted Matthews.
In fact, under Kimâs leadership, all mentions of a transparency report disappeared from the companyâs annual impact report. Ironically, this was around the same time that new legislation in Europe required tech companies to disclose reports of ânon-consensual behaviorâ and other issues. Match Group will be required to submit a transparency report to the European Union on the scope of harm on their platforms later this month. Lawmakers in India and Australia are also demanding transparency.
This is exactly the situation Breeden and her team pondered three years ago. âWhat if publishing in one jurisdiction sparks a requirement in another?â read a slide in the same internal presentation where Match Groupâs trust-and-safety leaders wondered whether they should âpush back on how much [they] are required to reveal.â
After Match Group published a disappointing earnings report in February 2025 that fell below analystsâ expectations, it also announced that Kim would be replaced by former Zillow CEO Spencer Rascoff. Tinderâs revenue, sales, and subscribers had all gone down.
As Match Group struggles to reverse its decline, itâs also aware that its reputation is in the spotlight. Earnings calls and shareholder letters over the first three quarters of 2024 indicate that the company knows it is a business imperative to make women feel safer on its platforms. Match Group brought in a new vice president to head trust and safety whose job partly focuses on complying with increased global transparency requirements. The company is experimenting with requiring faces in photos and rolled out a âShare My Dateâ feature so you can be tracked while meeting up with an online stranger. On Tinder, it orchestrated a âmajor ecosystem cleanupâ geared toward identifying fake profiles and getting scammers off the app.
But neither the cleanup nor tracking a date from your phone would have stopped Matthews â a man who never sought to hide his identity, who assaulted his dates in his own home â from finding and harming women.
Four years after Matthewsâ first documented assault, he walked into a wood-paneled courtroom in Denver and was sentenced to 158 years to life in prison. âI will sentence. I cannot heal,â Judge Eric Johnson told the room filled with survivors and family members.
âCountless women have suffered and will continue to suffer,â said Laura Wolf, an attorney who represented the woman whose police report triggered Matthewsâ arrest. âHinge and other dating platforms have taken no steps to ensure the safety of the product they are selling, matching unsuspecting women to known predators without pause or concern.â
Match Group didnât make it easy for the Denver prosecutors to convict Matthews. A search warrant was issued to Hinge in July 2023. Two months later, prosecutors were still empty-handed â with the judge in the case asking at a hearing if he needed to start âdragging people in to get stuff done.â It wasnât until February 2024 that the Denver District Attorneyâs Office said they finally received documents returned by Match Group.
Matthews will likely never leave prison. Match Group executives currently face no charges. But the company knew about Matthews, and it knows about thousands of other abusive users. It has the data that could help users avoid dangerous situations, but it hasnât shared it, leaving millions of people in the dark.
Lawmakers around the world are starting to ask for answers from the most powerful force in modern dating. In June, Colorado passed a law, triggered by the Matthews case, that forces dating app companies to tell the state attorney general what safety measures they are taking to protect users. Although the law leaves room for the possibility of additional transparency in the future, it does not currently require the company to tell the state, or the public, how many people are raped or assaulted after using its platform. In the U.S., weâve just scratched the surface. In most states, thereâs little that requires Match Group to share information with you â or with Congress.
The reality is that if Stephen Matthews were released today, he could get right back on a dating app. Match Group knows this â and now so do you.

11,2025-02-15,"Business Insider Edition 
Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said the company's latest update to ChatGPT 4o makes it the ""best search product on the web.""

        ChatGPT 4o is ""pretty good"" and is ""soon going to get much better,"" Altman said in a post on X on Saturday. He retweeted posts complimenting the chatbot's writing skills as ""unbelievably good"" and ""human like.""
    

        The GPT-4o model (with an ""o"" that stands for omni) was initially released in May and impressed users with its ability to handle text, audio, and images as inputs and outputs.
    

        OpenAI recently touted GPT 4o's ""smarter model"" that offers ""more relevant, current, and contextually accurate responses, especially for questions involving cultural and social trends.""
    

        It wasn't immediately clear if Altman was referring to a new ChatGPT 4o update or the one outlined by the company on January 29. OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
    

        Altman's comments about GPT 4o's search capabilities came during a cheeky exchange with Aravind Srinivas, the founder and CEO of Perplexity, a search-focused AI startup.
    

        Srinivas, who previously worked at OpenAI, replied to Altman's post about a GPT 4o update, saying, ""sorry what's the update?""
    

        Altman responded that ""among many other things, it's the best search product on the web"" and suggested Srinivas ""check it out.""
    

        Srinivas replied that his company had just released a deep research agent.
    

        In Altman's response, he told Srinivas to ""keep cooking out there,"" and that he was ""proud.""
    

ChatGPT's search market share rose from June to November 2024, challenging Google's dominance in the lucrative space, according to research from Evercore ISI.

12,2025-02-15,"It has been more than a decade since James Howells' hard drive - containing Bitcoin now worth hundreds of millions of pounds - ended up on a landfill site. 
But despite facing numerous setbacks, he is determined to continue on his mission to retrieve it.
""This is my job, if you will. My 9 to 5,"" he said, adding he would ""absolutely not"" give up.
The value of the cryptocurrency has dramatically increased in recent months, and with the hard drive currently worth about £620m, Mr Howells said ""it makes sense for me to focus my energy on this"" - although he does do some other work with crypto currencies. 
Mr Howells, from Newport, claimed his ex-partner mistakenly threw out the hard drive, containing 8,000 bitcoins, in 2013, with it ending up in a tip owned by Newport City Council. 
Last month, a High Court judge threw out his efforts to access the landfill or get £495m in compensation, saying there were no ""reasonable grounds"" for bringing the claim and ""no realistic prospect"" of succeeding at a full trial.
He is now planning a case – representing himself using artificial intelligence to support his claim – at the Court of Appeal. He has also expressed interested in buying the site after the council said it planned to close it in the 2025-26 financial year. 
Newport council said it was making no further comment on the matter.
Mr Howells was an early adopter of cryptocurrencies, mining the Bitcoin in 2009 when it was a small fraction of its current value.
He has said that his former partner accidentally dumped the hard drive – about the size of a mobile phone – containing a Bitcoin wallet in 2013. As its value soared, he organised a team of experts to attempt to locate and recover it.
He repeatedly asked permission from the council for access to the site, offering it a share of the missing Bitcoin if it was successfully recovered.
After Mr Howells launched legal proceedings, the council applied for a High Court hearing to ask a judge to dismiss the claim before going to trial – which the judge did last month.
The council argued its environmental permits would forbid any attempt to excavate the site for the search and previously said such work ""would have a huge negative environmental impact on the surrounding area"".
Unwilling to give up, Mr Howells now believes he has two options open to him to retrieve the digital wallet – launch a case at the Court of Appeal, or work with investors to try to buy the landfill site from the council, after it announced the site is ""coming to the end of its life"" and it plans to close it within the next two years.
Mr Howells told BBC News he was pleased with the work his legal team had done in the High Court trial, but that he would now be representing himself in a case filed with the Court of Appeal – using an ""artificial intelligence agent"" to assist his claim.
He described AI as ""an absolutely amazing technology"" that had helped him better understand court processes and the law, and that he believed he had about seven ""solid grounds in law"" for his case, which he hopes to be able to present in-person to the Court of Appeal.
One of the arguments in his case will centre on the council's plans to close the site, something he argued should have been revealed during the High Court trial.
""That is material information that should have been made [at the trial] – the judge should have been aware of that, as well as myself,"" he said.
Mr Howells also said buying and fully excavating the site would save the council what he argued were significant maintenance costs once the site closes.
""Every single piece would be extracted or recycled, and at the end of the process we would have a hard drive in our hands - and we would also have an empty landfill,"" he said.
In the High Court trial, the council also argued that the hard drive became its property as soon as it entered the landfill site, but Mr Howells said this failed to take into account the fact it was his ex-partner who threw it out.
""It was taken without my permission or consent,"" he said.
Mr Howells said he was also exploring the option of buying the site from the council, adding he had ""preliminary agreements"" with investors – including those in the Middle East and the United States – who could make funding available if he had permission to buy the site.
""They're not just going to put millions of quid in my back pocket... but if the council show a willingness to sell the site, then the funding will be available,"" he said.
The council has made no indication it is interested in selling the site and, as part of its closure, has secured planning permission for a solar farm on part of the land.
Having spent many years pursuing it, including opening legal cases, Mr Howells said he was certain the hard drive remained on the landfill, which holds more than 1.4 million tonnes of waste.
He said he had done his ""due diligence and research"", having spoken to a site manager at the landfill.
""Anything that was put into that site is still there. So, where else could it be?""
Asked if he would ever give up his mission to retrieve it, he said: ""Absolutely not. This is like the final battle in Braveheart.""
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a virtual or digital currency that has no physical form.
Bitcoins can be split into smaller units, with a satoshi being the smallest monetary unit. 
Satoshis are named after Bitcoin's inventor Satoshi Nakamoto – believed to be a pseudonym – who wrote a key document about the currency in 2008.
Those investing in the product around this time, like Mr Howells, were part of a ""very small"" crypto community known as Cypherpunks, said Billy Bambrough, author of the CryptoCodex newsletter.
Bitcoin was not the first cryptocurrency to be invented, but it did gain considerable attention with early adherents being ""very quickly enamoured with it"", Mr Bambrough said.
Prices began to rise in about 2016 and 2017, and again in 2020 during the Covid pandemic when ""stock markets, cryptocurrencies and meme coins went up hugely"".
""A lot of people got very rich, but a lot of people also lost money,"" Mr Bambrough said.
The cryptocurrency also saw rapid increases in late 2024, shortly after Donald Trump's victory in the US general election, with his administration being seen as far friendlier towards cryptocurrencies than the Biden White House.
""A lot of people in the crypto and Bitcoin worlds say the price has gone up so much in such a short amount of time, they claim it could go higher and higher,"" Mr Bambrough said.
""So I can understand why James [Howells] is keen to find his Bitcoin.""

13,2025-02-15,"For those who’ve never bitten the Apple, the PowerMac G4 was a blue-tinted desktop Macintosh offered from 1999 to 2004. At the time, the machines were plenty fast — being advertised as the first “personal supercomputer” when they hit the market. But Father Time is particularly harsh on silicon, so they’re properly archaic by modern standards.
As such, the rear panel of one of these machines is hardly where you’d expect to run into a functional USB-C port. But thanks to the efforts of [Dandu], old has officially met new. Critics will note that it’s not real USB-C, and instead uses USB 2.0 with the more modern connector. That’s true, but considering how many commercial devices we run into that are still using the same trick, we’ll give it a pass.

So in theory, all it should take to make this possible is a USB 2.0 PCI card and some clever wiring going into the back of a bulkhead USB-C connector. Which if you zoom out far enough, is exactly what [Dandu] did. But when your dealing with a 20+ year old computer, everything is easier said than done.
For one thing, it look awhile to find a PCI USB card that would actually work under the two operating systems the computer runs (OS X Tiger and Mac OS 9). For those taking notes, a card using the Ali M5273 chip ended up being the solution, although it can only hit USB 1.1 speeds under OS 9. He also needed to find card that had an internal header connector to wire the USB-C port to, which wasn’t always a given.
[Dandu] provides some screen shots and benchmarks to show how the new port works in both versions of Mac OS, but the  most important feature is that he can casually plug his phone into the back of the machine.

  being advertised as the first “personal supercomputer” when they hit the market.
   

Apple M1 😜
“Archaic”.. Yeah, that sounds so great.
But meanwhile Snow Leopard has just been ported to G4/G5 PPC by the community last year, by the way.
It runs on real 10.6 kernal, with files borrowed from other versions.
It’s even being possible to re-compile existing 10.6 projects freshly for PPC and stuff the resulting PPC binary together with the intel binary (universal binary).
https://lowendmac.com/2024/mac-os-x-snow-leopard-10-6-10-6-8-for-powerpc/
That is amazing! It is sad to see so much hardware “obsoleted”, when it still handles most of the workload of the average user.
True. I hope this fresh release will renew interest in porting a modern browser back to Snowy, for example.
Now that both PPC and Intel Macs can run it, I mean..
That’s really interesting! My Mac mini G4 is stuck at Leopard.
You could also just run the latest NetBSD. Maybe other BSDs too. Probably some linux or other as well, but linux is typically more of a pain in the ass.
they make a cable for that
I’m quite surprised Dandu had difficulty finding a working USB card. Basically any OHCI-compatible chip should work, I usually chose ones from NEC. You do have to faff around with extensions on 9.2, because there’s a regression where add-in USB ports do not work. 9.1 doesn’t have this problem.
Many card on the market today use Via chipset (with UHCI) and the main problem is the header. Many old PCI card d’ont have the 9 pins header.

14,2025-02-15,"While recent developments have introduced some uncertainty, the fundamental drivers of Nvidia's ... [+] growth remain robust.
As the world’s largest semiconductor company prepares to release its fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 (ending January 31, 2025) results post-market close on February 26, 2025, all eyes are on Nvidia Corporation (NVDA). With a staggering market capitalization of $3.4 trillion, the Santa Clara-based tech giant has become synonymous with the AI revolution, transforming from a gaming-focused GPU maker into a full-stack computing powerhouse reshaping global industries.
The upcoming earnings report comes at a crucial time for Nvidia, as investors seek clarity on whether the company can maintain its extraordinary growth trajectory amid emerging competition and evolving market dynamics. This analysis explores what investors should know before this pivotal earnings announcement.
The artificial intelligence landscape witnessed significant shifts in early 2025, marked by the emergence of new players and technological breakthroughs. One of the most notable developments has been the rise of the Chinese research lab DeepSeek, which demonstrated the ability to train competitive AI models at a fraction of the traditional computing power requirements, challenging conventional assumptions about AI infrastructure needs.
Despite these disruptions, major tech companies have doubled their AI investments. Industry giants like Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) have announced record-breaking capital expenditure plans for 2025, with Meta planning to spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure (up from $39.2 billion last year), Alphabet projecting $75 billion in capital expenditures. Amazon potentially exceeds $100 billion in AI-related investments
Nvidia’s stock has demonstrated remarkable strength, surging 136.7% over the past 52 weeks and significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Index's 25% gain and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's 17.9% return. However, the stock trades approximately 11% below its early January 2025 record high, following concerns about DeepSeek's technological breakthrough.
The company's financial performance has been equally impressive, with its most recent quarterly results showcasing the tremendous demand for AI computing solutions. In fiscal Q3 2025, Nvidia reported record Data Center revenue of $30.8 billion, representing a 112% year-over-year increase. Total revenues reached an all-time high of $35.1 billion, up 93.6% from the previous year, while net income grew by 108.9% to $19.3 billion.
Current market sentiment remains decisively positive, with 36 out of 43 analysts maintaining ""Strong Buy"" ratings on the stock. The mean price target of $176.55 suggests a potential 25.4% upside from current levels, reflecting continued optimism about Nvidia’s growth prospects.
The primary catalyst driving Nvidia's outlook continues to be the unprecedented demand for AI computing infrastructure. The company's latest Blackwell architecture, particularly the GB200 NVL72 system, offers performance capabilities that are 30 times faster than previous generations for AI inference tasks, positioning Nvidia to maintain its market leadership.
The company's dominant position in the data center GPU market, where it captured an astounding 98% market share in 2023, provides a strong foundation for continued growth. The H100 GPU was the hottest AI data center chip globally in 2023, later superseded by the H200 and now by the entirely new generation of GPUs based on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture.
CEO Jensen Huang's recent comment about ""insane"" demand following Blackwell's broad release at the end of 2024 suggests a strong market reception, with sales reportedly meeting high expectations. Major customers' aggressive infrastructure expansion plans further support the outlook for sustained demand growth.
Analysts expect NVIDIA to report EPS of $0.79 for the upcoming quarter, reflecting a 61.2% year-over-year increase from last year’s $0.49. The consensus revenue forecast of $38.1 billion exceeds management's guidance of $37.5 billion, signaling market confidence in NVIDIA's ability to outperform expectations.
The company has consistently delivered earnings surprises, beating estimates by:
Looking ahead to fiscal 2026, analysts project 43.2% year-over-year EPS growth, with earnings expected to reach $3.98 per share, up from $2.77 in fiscal 2025. Longer-term forecasts see EPS climbing to $4.92 in 2027 and $6.26 in 2028, reflecting continued momentum in AI-driven growth.
Wall Street focuses on the company's guidance for fiscal 2026's first quarter, with analysts forecasting nearly $42 billion in revenue. If management's guidance tops this number, it could help alleviate concerns about the DeepSeek development's impact on demand.
Key factors could significantly influence Nvidia's upcoming earnings report and market reaction. Each element warrants careful consideration as investors position themselves ahead of the announcement.
The global semiconductor supply chain remains critical to Nvidia's ability to meet the surging demand for its products. While the company has successfully navigated previous supply constraints, its ability to secure sufficient manufacturing capacity and maintain efficient distribution channels will be crucial for meeting the ambitious growth expectations set by Wall Street.
The company's relationships with key manufacturing partners and supply chain management strategies will be particularly important as it ramps production of its new Blackwell-based products while maintaining a supply of existing high-demand components.
DeepSeek's recent announcement that it successfully trained competitive AI models for just $5.6 million, using older-generation GPUs, has raised questions about the necessity of cutting-edge hardware for AI development. However, major customer commentary suggests that any training workload reduction could be offset by increasing inference demands, particularly as newer AI models require more computational power for operation.
Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that inference workloads are now consuming increasing computing power as newer AI models spend more time ""thinking"" (test-time scaling). This perspective from one of Nvidia's largest customers helps contextualize the evolving nature of AI infrastructure requirements.
While AI and data center applications have dominated recent discussions, Nvidia's gaming business remains significant. The gaming market's health and potential cryptocurrency mining demand could impact overall results. However, these factors have become less important given the overwhelming significance of data center revenue, which accounts for approximately 88% of total revenue.
Nvidia's stock presents several compelling opportunities for investors. The company's current valuation metrics, including a P/E ratio of 51.1, represent a 13% discount to its 10-year average P/E ratio 59.2. Based on forward earnings expectations for fiscal 2026 of $4.44 per share, the stock trades at an even more attractive forward P/E of 29.2.
This valuation gap suggests significant potential upside, as the stock would need to appreciate by 102% just to trade in line with its historical average P/E ratio, assuming current earnings forecasts prove accurate.
Major tech companies' massive capital expenditure commitments suggest sustained strong demand for Nvidia's products through 2025 and beyond. This provides a clear pathway for continued revenue growth and potential market share expansion in the AI infrastructure market.
Despite the positive outlook, investors should consider several risk factors. The emergence of efficient training methods demonstrated by DeepSeek could potentially impact demand for high-end GPUs, particularly if similar approaches gain widespread adoption.
The stock's high valuation, even at current discounted levels, leaves little room for execution missteps. Any indication of slowing growth or margin pressure could lead to significant price volatility, as evidenced by the 7% decline following the company's Q3 earnings release in November 2024, despite strong results.
Competition in the AI chip market is intensifying, with both established players and startups working to develop alternative solutions. While Nvidia's market position remains strong, maintaining its current market share may become increasingly challenging.
Bottom Line
Nvidia's upcoming earnings report represents a crucial moment for the company and the broader AI industry. While recent developments have introduced some uncertainty, the fundamental drivers of Nvidia's growth remain robust. Strong customer commitments, continuous innovation, and attractive valuation metrics suggest the company is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in AI computing infrastructure. As the February 26 earnings announcement approaches, investors should focus on management's forward guidance and commentary about evolving market dynamics, which will likely provide valuable insights into Nvidia's trajectory for the remainder of 2025 and beyond.

If it feels like everyone you know is going to Japan right now — sort of how it felt like everyone was going to Iceland back in the 2010s — that's because they are.

        The iconic images of Iceland's Blue Lagoon and black sand beaches that dominated social media feeds have given way to pastel-colored images of Mount Fuji and adorable videos of snow monkeys soaking in hot springs in Japan's Jigokudani Monkey Park.
    

        ""It's become 'the destination,' especially with younger clients,"" Katherine Flynn, a travel planner for the New York-based travel agency Fora, told Business Insider of Japan. ""This is one of the few destinations I'll have clients include TikTok links when they submit their 'must-do activities' in my inquiry form.""
    

        In 2024, the number of visitors to Japan reached a record high of nearly 37 million, a 47% increase from 2023 and a 15% increase from 2019, before the pandemic. The number of Americans alone who visited Japan in December grew more than 30% year-over-year, according to preliminary data compiled by the Japanese government.
    

        The travel boom has been driven in part by Japan's weak currency, making a destination previously considered expensive to visit much more affordable. Lauren Joory, another Fora advisor, said the US dollar's strong position against the yen as well as Japan's closed borders for a couple years after the pandemic have fueled Americans' interest in the country.
    

        Similarly, Iceland's tourism boom came in the wake of an economic crisis — and also helped pull the island nation out of it. But while tourists can be a welcome sight to a struggling economy, they can also bring with them a host of problems associated with overtourism, as some destinations in Japan are already experiencing.
    

        Though the two countries are different in some key ways, sustainable tourism advocates say there are lessons for Japan to learn from Iceland, as well as other destinations that have undergone rapid tourism growth in a relatively short amount of time.
    

        After the financial crisis of 2008, the value of the Icelandic krona tanked, along with the Iceland Stock Exchange. Thousands lost their homes and unemployment skyrocketed. Two years later, the eruption of the Eyjafjallajkull volcano disrupted air travel to Europe and caused more problems for the already struggling country — but it also drew international awareness to Iceland.
    

        Travelers from around the world — drawn in by the weak krona and creative marketing by budget airlines promoting Iceland as a desirable stopover between Europe and the Americas — started rolling in. Iceland's annual visitor numbers grew by 328% between 2010 and 2019.
    

        ""Tourism was extremely important to get us back on our feet after the crash, and it grew into our biggest export industry,"" Sigrur Dgg Gumundsdttir, then the head of Visit Iceland, told ADP in 2022.
    

        Now Japan is facing economic challenges of its own, including a weak currency, high inflation, and shrinking GDP. Japan is also dealing with an aging population, low birth rate, and a labor shortage.
    

        ""Tourism's a quick win for many of these places,"" said Alan Fyall, the Visit Orlando endowed chair of tourism marketing at the University of Central Florida's Rosen College of Hospitality Management who studies sustainable tourism, said of countries with struggling economies.
    

        ""Tourism can be a very, very powerful economic and social force for good. There's no question. However, it's like everything — it's how you do it,"" he said.
    

        As the travel industry news site Skift put it in 2019, Iceland became ""the poster child for the positive and negative effects of the overtourism phenomenon"" as tourism evolved into the country's biggest industry in a relatively short number of years. The impacts of the tourism boom included crowding at hot spots, disrespectful tourist behavior, stress on infrastructure and natural areas, and higher prices for locals and visitors, as well as a potential over-reliance on tourism as an industry.
    

        Japan is much larger than Iceland — in size, population, and GDP — but the country is already facing some of the same overtourism problems.
    

        Masaru Takayama, chairperson at the Japan Alliance of Responsible Travel Agencies and an expert in sustainable travel, said Kyoto, where he is based, has become ""a capital of overtourism."" The central part of the city has been inundated with tourists who are consuming public resources and making it difficult for local residents to go about their daily lives.
    

        ""We have a lot of elders here who can ride buses and subway for free, but there's no seats available for them,"" he said.
    

        Takayama said local businesses have also changed to accommodate the tourists. He said his favorite restaurants are within walking distance but that it's difficult to actually go because tourists make reservations months in advance. The restaurants have also raised prices and switched up their menus to cater more to foreigners.
    

        ""We can literally see these places, but you cannot go,"" he said, adding, ""So we are really losing the authenticity of what it was, what was nice about Kyoto.""
    

        A rise in rental properties has also led to higher prices and taxes for locals, many of whom don't work in tourism-related industries and therefore are experiencing the downsides of tourism without much of the benefits, he said.
    

        Japan has already taken some measures to address issues with tourism. Last year officials in Kyoto banned tourists from certain alleyways in Gion, the popular geisha district, after complaints from locals about visitors' behavior.
    

        Fujikawaguchiko, a small town near Mount Fuji, said last year it was building a mesh barrier to block a popular photo spot for tourists after residents complained about disrespectful behavior. Japan also announced last year new regulations and a tourist tax for climbing Mount Fuji, a UNESCO World Heritage site, due to overcrowding.
    

        Still, the experts who spoke to BI said Japan should focus on a proactive approach to managing tourism that prioritizes the needs of the locals alongside the benefits of tourism.
    

        Fyall said Japan is relatively new to the tourism game, only emerging as a common destination for travelers in the past 10 to 15 years.He also said the country has been relatively cautious about promoting tourism and not quite as aggressive as other destinations. But now that the yen is weak, he said it's ""bonanza time"" for travelers from China and the West.
    

        Anna Abelson, an adjunct professor at New York University's Jonathan M. Tisch Center of Hospitality, said Iceland was not initially prepared for its tourism boom, but that the pandemic, while challenging for the tourism industry, allowed the country to shift its focus on fostering a sustainable travel industry.
    

        Iceland has adopted several measures to address overtourism, including a tourism tax, which is applied to hotel rooms, cruises, and campsites and is used to support sustainability efforts and mitigate the environmental impact of tourism. The country has also invested millions in improving infrastructure at popular tourist spots, building much-needed parking lots, restrooms, and designated trails, and encouraging visitors to travel to less-explored areas.
    

        Abelson said Japan should be proactive — rather than reactive — at addressing the problems with overtourism or risk getting to a point where locals take out their frustration on tourists. In Barcelona last summer, for instance, protesters sprayed visitors dining at restaurants in the city center with water guns during a demonstration against overtourism.
    

        Abelson said one thing Japan could do is appeal to tourists directly to encourage better behavior, like the Palau Pledge, in which visitors to the island nation are required to sign a pledge ""to act in an ecologically and culturally responsible way."" She said Japan could also focus on spreading tourists out, as Thailand has done by promoting lesser-known regions like Chang Mai and other islands, instead of the areas that are already experiencing overcrowding.
    

        Takayama said he thinks the Japanese government is still focusing on tourism quantity rather than quality, the latter of which he says is necessary for sustainable tourism. While there are sustainable tourism guidelines — set by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council, which Takayama is part of — he said implementation and action is another question.
    

        He agreed that Japan could encourage tourists to visit lesser-known places, but that the government would also have to ensure those destinations are prepared and could accommodate tourists in a sustainable way. He also said the government could do more to try and attract the right kinds of tourists who are interested in traveling responsibly.
    

        ""Japan is still a very good place to visit, and there are a lot of sanctuaries that people are not aware of, which they should explore,"" he said. ""We will love to have you as long as you obey the local rules.""

No two ways about it: This stock market is getting twitchy, and it’s (frankly beyond) time for all investors to take it seriously.
Trade wars. The possibility of spiking inflation. The Fed’s “will they or won’t they” act around rate cuts. And then there’s the ongoing doubt about whether AI will deliver on its big profit promises.
We’re all feeling it: The market heads higher, and every day it does, the voice in our head telling us that a fall is around the corner grows just a little bit louder.
So what are we going to do? We’re certainly not going to abandon stocks—or the stock focused closed-end funds (CEFs).
Because over the long run, stocks are still the No. 1 way to build wealth for pretty well all investors (and of course, we do not want to reduce our income stream from our stock holdings). But we are going to take the prudent step of bolstering our stock holdings with CEFs holding another asset that gives us reliable income, low volatility and a valuable tax shelter, too.
I’m talking about municipal bonds, which state and local governments issue to pay for infrastructure projects. As I’ll show you below, these so-called “boring” investments are anything but. Plus we get a package of “extra” benefits when we buy our “munis” through 7.5%-yielding CEFs.
Munis have long been a go-to for conservative income investors. They provide tax-free income, low default rates and a loyal investor base that tends to buy their munis and hang on to them forever, helping further reduce volatility.
Further helping reduce volatility is the fact that there are strict rules in place to ensure municipalities only borrow as much as they can afford. This lets us collect munis’ high yields with less stress than we might have with taxable bonds and stocks.
Since many munis’ dividends are federally tax-free (and some are even exempt from state and local taxes), they tend to appeal to wealthy investors, as well. Look at this:
Tax Equivalent Yields
As the chart above shows, if you’re in the highest tax bracket, a 5% yield from a muni bond (or a CEF holding munis) is equal to 8.3% from a taxable bond or stock (and the three muni-bond CEFs we’ll look at below yield a lot more than that!).
Muni-bond yields are higher than they’ve been in years, thanks to the Federal Reserve’s rate hikes, which allowed muni-bond CEFs to buy higher-yielding bonds. Now that rates are falling more slowly than originally expected, there’s still a large pool of higher-yielding munis available for our CEFs to buy.
And when the Fed goes back to cutting rates, likely later this year, those bonds should see price gains—particularly intermediate- and long-duration bonds—as they’ll have more appeal than newly issued bonds that yield less.
Moreover, with 2025 likely to show lower stock returns than 2023 and 2024, more stock investors should be looking to pick up munis, as well, adding to our buy case here.
With all that said, let’s look at three high-yielding muni-bond CEFs with attractive discounts: With over 7.6% dividends on average, these funds produce an incredible income stream equal to a 12.5% taxable yield.
3 Fund Table
Let’s start with the Invesco Value Municipal Income Trust (IIM). This fund, like all three of our muni-bond CEFs, focuses on undervalued muni bonds from across the US, which limits its geographic risk. As you can see above, it trades at a 6.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), which means we’re buying its holdings for a little over 93 cents on the dollar.
Like most CEFs, the fund uses leverage to boost returns—in the case of IIM, it has borrowed against about 32% of its portfolio. That’s reasonable for low-volatility assets like munis. Moreover, Invesco can borrow for much less than you and me—and its borrowing costs will fall as interest rates do.
Perhaps the best thing about IIM, though, is that the weighted average maturity of its portfolio is 18.8 years, incredibly long for a bond fund. This means IIM has locked in high yields that can be relied on for nearly two decades.
If interest rates start to fall fast, expect investors to pivot to funds like IIM to secure a higher income stream for longer, while bond CEFs with short durations will have to buy newer bonds that yield less.
The Invesco Quality Municipal Income Trust (IQI), for its part, locks in its portfolio’s income stream for even longer, with a weighted average maturity of 19.28 years. On top of that, its focus on higher-rated bonds (that’s what the “quality” in the name refers to) means it has a bit of extra insulation in a major selloff, while offering roughly the same yield as its sister fund, IIM.
IQI uses roughly the same amount of leverage as IIM, at 31.5%. But here again, it benefits from Invesco’s low borrowing costs (which, again, are likely to fall with rates).
Finally, the DWS Municipal Income Fund (KTF) provides safety in a different way: It has the longest history of our three muni-bond funds, having been launched back in 1988. Since then, it’s piled on a 678% total return, showing why it’s a strong long-term muni-bond holding for just about any investor’s portfolio.
In fact, KTF has been around so long that it predates the iShares National Muni Bond ETF (MUB), the benchmark for the muni-bond space, which was launched nearly 20 years after KTF, in 2007.
Since then, it’s nearly doubled MUB’s total return.
KTF yields 7.6%, roughly the same as the other two funds here. It also sports an effective maturity of 17.4 years, giving us extra assurance around the dividend. The fund’s 3.2% discount is lower than those of the other two, but still reasonable in light of its long history of outperformance.
That history comes down to its management team, which has shown it knows how to adjust the fund’s portfolio as interest rates shift.
These three funds offer strong yields and compelling discounts, making them attractive buys for any income investor or, really, anyone looking to diversify beyond stocks.
They’re just the beginning: There are over 100 publicly traded muni-bond CEFs, and many are better deals than these three. That lets us swing into (and out of) the best ones for the market moment, giving us high, stable yields and a level of safety we can’t get by investing in stocks alone.

Even in conversation, it’s easy to see why Shatara Michelle Ford is such a good director. The “Test Pattern” and “Dreams in Nightmares” filmmaker is clear, direct, goal-oriented, and focused. Asked by IndieWire their (Ford, who is nonbinary, uses they/them/she pronouns) hopes for this year’s Berlin Film Festival, where their sophomore feature will screen in the Panorama section and continue to seek distribution, Ford doesn’t fuss: “Buy my movie, give me a job.”
Those two things shouldn’t be tough for a film as good as “Dreams in Nightmares” and for a filmmaker as exciting as Ford, but Ford is well-aware of how tenuous the American independent film market is these days. Case in point: the film actually premiered at the BlackStar Film Festival on August 1, 2024. Berlin is only its second stop.

 








Related Stories ‘Mickey 17’ Review: Robert Pattinson and Robert Pattinson Star in Bong Joon Ho’s Best English-Language Film So Far 2025 ADG Lifetime Honorees Share Highlights from Their Storied Careers 
Ford’s “Dreams in Nightmares” follows four long-time friends, all queer Black women in their mid-thirties, as they embark on a road trip that’s also something of a thriller. Ford tucks major ideas and themes into the stunning feature, one that functions both as an intimate exploration of identity and a rallying cry for a new kind of world. While the potential for that sort of ambition could lead another filmmaker into academic, dry territory, Ford’s film is the opposite: alive, surprising, funny, shocking, and true.
Ford’s “Test Pattern,” a standout debut from 2019, also premiered at BlackStar. The film was distributed by Kino Lorber and went on to be nominated for three Gotham Awards, including Best Picture and three Independent Spirit Awards, including Best First Feature. Billed by this writer as a “perceptive look at sexual assault and relationships,” Ford’s film was one of the finest of the year, and it’s no surprise their follow-up is just as good.
But the road hasn’t been easy. Such is the life of an independent American filmmaker. Yet, over the course of a wide-ranging, hour-long interview, Ford often came back to that idea that it doesn’t have to be that way, that the system needs to change, can change, and they’ve got ideas as to how to make that happen.
In the days leading up to the film’s Berlinale premiere, Ford was characteristically open and thoughtful. Consider a basic question: how are you doing?

 









“I’m OK, I don’t know, it’s like, what is good, what is well in the context of what we’re sitting in this moment?,” Ford said. “But above all, I’m also just very, very, very tired, which I think is the way it goes when movies are made the way that I make them.”
The way Ford makes films is scrappy and deeply considered, emotionally taxing and edifying, on tight budgets, with close-knit cast and crew. It wasn’t always going to be that way. Well, not that exact way.
“I made ‘Test Pattern’ because I was trying to get another [film] made and [that was] the ‘right way’ within the system to do that, and I was just like, ‘This doesn’t make sense,'” Ford said. “I feel like I’m always straddling the two worlds of my own process and style that’s grown out of necessity, and the actual romantic dream of how I actually wanted to make movies and navigate the system. I’ve never been given the opportunity to do the other thing, but the work [I’ve made] is arguably more interesting and more alive.”
Initially, Ford said, they dreamed of a career like those of their heroes David Fincher, Steven Soderbergh, Robert Altman, and John Cassavetes. After they made “Test Pattern,” Ford said, they thought, “Oh, I’m about to get my ‘Panic Room.’ I’m like, ‘Where’s my “Insomnia”?’ I am looking for that mid-budget adult thing, with a level of thriller and action and great actors and I know I can do that, and that’s all I’ve ever wanted to do on one level. But the artist part of me emerged out of trying to figure out how to do that thing. So now I’m in this bifurcated space always.”

 









When Ford realized their “Panic Room” was not coming, they had to figure out how to make their own opportunities (again). Far easier said than done. In 2022, Ford said, they were “really, really, really fucking broke,” terrified of what was coming with the strikes, cognizant of the lack of sales out of other festivals, and constantly hearing conversations that hinged on one perpetual question: “Is independent film dead?”
They didn’t want it to be. More than anything, Ford wanted to make another movie, and was eager to find a way to do just that. “What can I do with what little resources that I have, the little juice that I got outside of ‘Test Pattern’? I have agents now, they’ve introduced me to a lot of people, a lot of people have said they want to work with me,” Ford said.
But the money people didn’t always jibe with Ford’s ideas, so they opted to pursue a somewhat wild idea. “I was looking at certain numbers and my producing partner Pin-Chun Liu and I were like, there’s a financial sweet spot that we can sit in in which we could probably get money from the financiers who already say they want to support me and try to make another film the same way we did it last time,” they said. “I just went to different financiers, and I was like, ‘Hey, you said you want to give me money. I have an idea for a movie. I’m never giving you a script, but I am up for you giving me whatever you feel like losing.’”

 









Wait, never give them a script? It was a three-pronged process, by Ford’s telling. “I was literally like, ‘I will only have three conversations with you: The first is, you have to agree that you’re going to give me money, it can be a dollar, but you must agree. The second is, I will tell you the idea, and I will tell you the kind of budget and approach. The third is, you’re going to tell me how much money you’re going to give me, and that’s it.’”
Ford put a timer on it. They had six weeks to respond. It worked. Before the strikes, the filmmaker said, they locked in four financiers. (The rest of the money? As they did with “Test Pattern,” Ford put it on their credit card.) And while Ford’s gamble paid off, it’s not something the filmmaker recommends for everyone. What they do, however, think is important is a general reevaluation of the way everything is done when it comes to independent filmmaking. 
“As we talk about the state of independent filmmaking in America, honestly, [we should] all just stop and say, ‘OK, there’s these things that are happening. It sounds like we need to take some time and energy to, instead of stressing and putting all of that work into trying to jam a film or jam an event that’s not sitting well anymore, we have to redraw the whole thing,’” Ford said.

 









That’s where the guidelines came from. Before Ford and Liu made “Dreams in Nightmares,” they codified and shared a list of “Production Community Guidelines” that, at the time, Ford told IndieWire, “came out of our reflections after making ‘Test Pattern.’ These guidelines are expectations and openings and reminders. They are re-framers. They also aren’t perfect… but no one and nothing is. All we can do each day is try to do better.”
“If I’m working with different cast, different crew, different conditions, those things will change,” Ford said today. “But the idea was like, these are the principles for us to work with to ensure that we are drawing a different shape for the film to be successful. I’ve worked on other film sets, big, expensive, professional ones, and you watch the same things happen over and over and over again. If we had just taken a step back and really considered everything that is in front of us, we can make nimble adjustments that makes it run as it should.”
Those other productions also had something Ford never does: money to throw at the problems, instead of actually fixing them. “They flow it with cash, and we know that we’re never going to have that, so it’s all in the planning ahead of time and the structure before,” the filmmaker said. “There’s always going to be trial and error because there’s things you’re not going to be able to see. And again, that’s why the guidelines were what they were, because we’re like, we need to account for the fact that there will be mistakes.”

 









To make the kind of films they want to make the way they want to make, Ford knows, could be limiting. “This might be the only thing I do, which I’m fine with,” they said. “It’ll always be hard, and I’m OK with that. Everyone makes compromises at different points, and I’m just making very specific ones that I think keep me from any element of comfort. Honestly, it’s all in the movie. The body I have, the very short, dark-skinned, femme, queer body that I’m in, it is always uncomfortable, always. And I’m so used to it. So I have to find peace where I can get it and take that space to reflect again on, OK, what are the proactive things that I need to be doing?”
One proactive thing: the choice to take “Dreams in Nightmares” to BlackStar, the Philadelphia-based festival that aims to be an “annual celebration of the visual and storytelling traditions of Black, Brown, and Indigenous people from around the world.” Two days after they finished the film, Ford said, they sent it to BlackStar. 
“There were a lot of convenient things for me in finishing a film in July and then giving it away in August, that releases a lot of tension and stress for me as I’m charting a path for the film,” Ford said. “You can chase festivals all fucking day, and every filmmaker has that strain and stress and pressure, especially when you’re at my level. That will kill you on its own. Therefore, you have no time to think about, wait, are there other moves that we can make to allow this film to be seen?”

 









And the film was seen. Ford does their own test screenings, so they knew it would work, that it would resonate, but the experience was still surprising. 
“That audience crossed age groups, not everyone was gay, not everyone was Black. But it was a very strange experience for me, as someone who’s watched the film a lot and tested it a lot, to hear responses,” they said. “It was never quiet. People were always responding to the movie, which also is a very Black thing, which I love about us. The energy, it was so palpable and strong, and I was overcome.”
Not in the audience? As Ford told it, “Not a single sales-related person was in that room to get any kind of sense of temperature on the audience that was there. That is dumb. It shows what priorities actually are in Hollywood, because that just should not have happened. I never believe people never when they’re like, ‘Oh, yeah, we want to tell more stories that include underrepresented voices,’ because you’re only doing the low-hanging fruit that’s in front of you, that’s convenient at the conferences that you go to because it’s a line item in your budget. Because to really prioritize that stuff, you have to do the stuff that’s uncomfortable, that’s unusual, that doesn’t feel sanctioned or validated. You will have to walk an unknown, dark path. You just will.”

 









That BlackStar is different than Berlin is a given. Example: Ford likes BlackStar, and they don’t really like film festivals.
“I don’t like film festivals. I want to be very clear on the record on it, because I don’t really understand their purpose,” Ford said. “Is it a place where we discover new work and new voices and new ideas? Or is it a marketplace? For my tastes and my enjoyment, I prefer the one where we’re watching movies and we’re celebrating each other. … This is a thing again about thinking about the structure and how it doesn’t necessarily work. When we talk about the market festivals, there’s this emphasis on the audience. Hold on, the audience is a whole bunch of people at the [festival] that are already in the business. We will never know how well a movie is going to do if we do not expose it to the ‘audience’ it’s for.”
And Ford knows there is an audience for their film, and they’d love for someone at Berlin (or wherever) to get hip to that. When Ford says they want someone to buy their movie, that comes with some deeper ideas: they want someone to buy it, because it’s good and deserves to be seen.
“What I expect is that my movie gets sold, I expect, hear me out, I expect it,” Ford said. “What I’m not going to take is that my movie is bad. I know it’s not. It’s not, so therefore, buy it. The end. It’s kind of simple. No one’s going to blame this on me. No one’s going to say, ‘Oh my God, the movie didn’t sell because the movie is bad.’ Nope. That is the answer. I want it to sell.”

 









Ford will not be personally traveling to Berlin for the festival, but they remain fiercely attuned to what’s happening there. And, yes, clear in their aims. “Buy my movie, give me a job. Easy, really simple,” Ford said of what they want out of Berlin. “I would like a job and I would like someone, with a real strategy, to buy my movie, someone who is open to doing things a little differently, who is open to considering the shape of the movie and then building something intentionally.”
And if the film doesn’t sell?
“If I don’t get sold, fine. But I mean, everyone is being silly, if they don’t [buy it],” Ford said with a smile. “I feel like self-distribution, whatever that means in 2025, has always been an under-explored concept. And that makes sense, because the system doesn’t want you to do [it]. To believe that relying on a very weak distribution landscape, a very weak exhibition landscape, is the only way that something gets done, is not recommended for an independent filmmaker.”
Maybe that’s Ford’s next frontier. When they say they’ll call up theaters and book the film themselves, we don’t doubt it. The film is good. It deserves to be seen. Ford will make that happen, but some help sure would be nice. 
“Maybe what we’re really talking about is things needing to be revamped and innovated and taking principles and ideas from each other,” Ford said. “Francis Ford Coppola wanted to make sure that ‘Megalopolis’ came out and what did he do? Soderbergh has experimented with his version of self-distribution, going as far as having a distribution company for a moment. These are all experiments, and they’re good, there’s lessons in them, and you run out of money, whatever, you get tired, whatever.”

 









Buy their movie. Give them a job. You will not be disappointed. 
You can watch an exclusive clip of “Dreams in Nightmares” below. The film will next screen at the 2025 Berlin International Film Festival, where it is seeking distribution, on Sunday, February 16.

22,2025-02-15,"Apple is in the middle of trickling out a variety of announcements including Powerbeats Pro 2 and an Apple TV+ app for Android phones this week, and based on a tease from Tim Cook it looks like there's at least one bigger announcement in store for next Wednesday.
While a new iPhone SE is the odds-on favorite for Wednesday's announcement, there are a few other products we're expecting to see launch in the relatively near future, so we'll have to hang tight to see just how Apple plans to roll them out. Read on below for all the details on this week's biggest stories!

In a bit of an unusual move, Apple CEO Tim Cook has teased an upcoming ""launch"" of some kind scheduled for Wednesday, February 19.
""Get ready to meet the newest member of the family,"" he said in a social media post, with an #AppleLaunch hashtag.
Cook did not provide an exact time for the launch, or share any other specific details, so his post is a bit of a mystery. However, Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes the post is a teaser for Apple announcing a new iPhone SE.

If next week's launch is indeed the next-generation iPhone SE, we're expecting a host of upgrades to modernize Apple's low-end iPhone, including Face ID, an A18 chip with Apple Intelligence support, and more.
Timing for a launch has been a bit unclear, with Bloomberg's Mark Gurman previously claiming it would be arriving this week and a generic listing for it popping up on a French reseller's website, but it now looks like things are lining up for a slightly later debut.

There continue to be signs of a new MacBook Air with an M4 chip, indicating that we could see the machine launch in the not too distant future. A reliable source this week shared the identifiers that the ‌MacBook Air‌ will use, and those identifiers correspond to the M4 chip.
Rumors have suggested that the M4 MacBook Air has been in production for months already, and Apple itself leaked references to it in macOS Sequoia 15.2 back in December, but Apple has yet to officially announce it.

Apple's Beats brand officially introduced the Powerbeats Pro 2 this week, bringing significant updates to the wireless earphones aimed at active users.
Among the upgrades for Powerbeats Pro 2 are Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) with Transparency mode, Personalized Spatial Audio, an H2 chip for improved power efficiency and Apple ecosystem integration, and for the first time in an Apple audio product, Heart Rate Monitoring.

Apple has debuted a new Android smartphone app on the Google Play store that will allow users on that platform to more easily subscribe to and watch Apple TV+ content, including MLS Season Pass.
Android users can access Apple TV+ and MLS Season Pass by signing into their Apple Account, or subscribe directly through Google Play's billing system.

Apple this week released iOS 18.3.1 and iPadOS 18.3.1, which offer bug fixes and security improvements including a fix for a vulnerability that ""may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.""
On devices that support Apple Intelligence, some users who previously turned off the feature have found it automatically turned back on after updating, so be sure to double check your settings if you don't wish to use Apple Intelligence.

Apple has yet to enter the foldable smartphone market, but other manufacturers continue to press forward with their efforts and push the boundaries of what's physically possible.
Oppo has confirmed it will debut its Find N5 or OnePlus Open 2 foldable phone on February 20, with the device reportedly measuring just 4mm thick when open.

23,2025-02-15,"Warren Buffett added one new stock to Berkshire Hathaway's publicly-traded equity portfolio, while ... [+] eliminating three holdings. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)
Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK/A, BRK/B) fourth-quarter 13F was filed after the market closed on Valentine’s Day, February 14. This regulatory filing gives us a quarterly opportunity to observe what Warren Buffett and his investment team of Todd Combs and Ted Weschler are doing within Berkshire’s publicly traded equity portfolio. Berkshire has a large stable of wholly-owned entities, but this report provides us with the details of the U.S. publicly traded stock portion of their investments. Berkshire’s fourth-quarter earnings report, containing Warren Buffett’s annual letter and information about the extensive portfolio of wholly-owned operating companies, is expected on Saturday, February 22.
Berkshire’s $267 billion investment portfolio consists of 38 companies, down two from last quarter. Berkshire was likely a net seller of publicly traded stocks during the quarter. The top five holdings, in order of the size of holding, are Apple (AAPL), American Express (AXP), Bank of America (BAC), Coca-Cola (KO), and Chevron (CVX). The top 5 holdings account for almost 71% of the total portfolio, down from 76% in the first quarter. The investment portfolio remains very concentrated, with nearly 90% of assets in the top ten holdings.
Percent Of Berkshire Hathaway's $267 Billion Portfolio: 38 Total Holdings
Notably, Berkshire stopped paring their Apple (AAPL) position in the fourth quarter. Before the sales in 2024, Apple stock comprised over 50% of its publicly traded portfolio, but it remains the most significant holding at around 28%. The Berkshire portfolio was overweight technology due to its massive Apple stake, but the selling in 2024 has taken technology to a slight underweight. Despite the trimming of Bank of America (BAC), Capital One Financial (COF), Citigroup (C), and Nu Holdings (NU), the financial sector is the most significant overweight in the portfolio at almost 40% of assets. Due to its top five holdings, plus Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Kraft Heinz (KHC), the portfolio remains considerably overweight in consumer staples and energy relative to the S&P 500. Berkshire controls 28% of the outstanding shares in Occidental, which, combined with Chevron, leads to a significant energy sector overweight. A deeper analysis of the probable reasons behind the Occidental purchase can be found here. Berkshire has only one small holding in the industrial sector and no real estate companies or utilities. However, Berkshire’s wholly-owned entities include a large railroad, Burlington Northern Santa Fe, and multiple regulated utilities and pipelines.
Holdings By Sector
Because the 13F does not include international stocks, Berkshire Hathaway initially announced the acquisition of about 5% of five Japanese trading companies at the end of August 2020. These holdings are Itochu Corp., Marubeni Corp., Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsui & Co. Ltd., and Sumitomo Corp. Buffett revealed in April 2023 that Berkshire increased its stakes in these companies to 7.4%. Buffett indicated that these were intended to be long-term holdings, and Berkshire may still increase its stake to 9.9%.
Berkshire added one new holding, Constellation Brands (STZ). At a value of over $1.2 billion and the nineteenth largest holding, it was a decent-sized addition to the portfolio, accounting for almost half a percent of assets. Constellation is best known for owning the rights to Corona and Modelo beers in the U.S., but it also owns some wine and spirits brands. Beer accounts for about 80% of their sales. In January, the company reported worse-than-expected quarterly earnings and lowered its outlook for the year. Potential tariffs on Mexico could negatively impact its Mexican beer earnings. In addition, there are fears that the GLP-1 diet drugs and a growing preference for cannabis could weigh on the long-term outlook of its alcohol brands. On the other hand, the stock is now selling for a multi-year low in valuation across several metrics.
Berkshire added to its positions in Domino’s Pizza (DPZ), Pool Corporation (POOL), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Verisign (VRSN), and Sirius XM Holdings (SIRI).
Ulta Beauty (ULTA) was eliminated from the portfolio in the quarter after being trimmed last quarter. Notably, Ulta Beauty was newly added to the portfolio in the second quarter of 2024. Minor holdings in the Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were also jettisoned.
Within financials, Berkshire trimmed its Citigroup (C), Capital One Financial (COF), Bank of America (BAC), and NU Holdings (NU). Warren Buffett is regarded as one of the greatest bank stock investors ever. Hence, the continued reduction in exposure to the banking sector is notable, but almost 40% of the stock portfolio remains in financial companies.
Berkshire also reduced its positions in T-Mobile (TMUS), Charter Communications (CHTR), Liberty Media—Formula One (FWONK), and Louisiana-Pacific (LPX).
This analysis looks at the Berkshire portfolio across a host of measures, including 12-month forward estimated: price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), return-on-equity (ROE), enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EV/EBITDA), price-to-book (P/B), dividend yield, current debt-to-EBITDA, current free cash flow yield, current operating margin, and long-term earnings-per-share growth consensus estimates.
Portfolio Valuation Metrics
Overall, the Berkshire portfolio analysis reflects a cheaper price-to-earnings valuation than the S&P 500 while having superior profitability as measured by return on equity and operating margin with similar debt levels. The long-term (next 3 to 5 years) consensus earnings-per-share growth rate is expected to be lower than the S&P 500. Buffett’s preference for high-quality companies that generate significant cash flows is evident from the better profitability metrics combined with a superior free cash flow yield.
Berkshire was likely a net seller of stocks in its portfolio for the ninth quarter in a row, with an estimated net sales of about $5 billion in publicly traded stocks. The exact value of stock moves will be disclosed with Saturday’s earnings release. Between the continued stock sales and Berkshire’s massive stockpile of cash, Buffett seems unable to find enough attractive acquisition targets in his circle of competence and at a valuation he is willing to pay.

27,2025-02-15,"Hanna Hickman, a now terminated CFPB worker, told ABC it's a ""scary"" moment.
Hanna Hickman, a now-terminated worker for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, told ABC News the last four days have been a roller coaster.
""It's scary,"" said Hickman, who was fired last Tuesday. ""I had a real moment -- I was at CVS the other day and ... it kind of came on me all at once that I might not have health insurance in a few weeks, and that really hits you. I think it underscores the fact that we're just regular, middle-class people, just like the people we're trying to serve.""
Hickman was senior litigation counsel for the Division of Enforcement at the CFPB in Washington, D.C. She is one of thousands of mostly new employees known as probationary workers laid off this week across the federal government. Those recent hires had joined the federal workforce within the last one to two years, depending on the agency, and have fewer protections.
Hickman was a probationary hire who had been at the CFPB just under two years until Tuesday around 9 p.m., when she saw a termination notice pop up on her phone.
""It was shocking, frankly -- not just to us but to our direct managers, who had not been told this would happen and received notice of the terminations at the same time we did because they were CC'd,"" Hickman told ABC News.
The mass layoffs have wreaked havoc on scores of federal employees, including at the Department of Education, the CFPB, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and other agencies. Hickman stressed that last Tuesday was surreal because CFPB employees had already been told last weekend that they could not show up to work in person. Her belongings are still inside the bureau.
""It's really a shock,"" she said, ""especially for a lawyer because we have professional obligations. I have a case that I'm currently litigating for the bureau, and all of a sudden, I'm cut off from our systems, and it's the equivalent of being escorted out of the building and fired. It's just, it's absolutely shocking, especially when there have been no concerns about my performance during my time at the bureau.""
Hickman hasn't been inside the CFPB in over a week since that Friday, Feb. 7, when Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency descended on the CFPB headquarters. That day, Musk posted on X: ""CFPB RIP.""
""We're under attack by billionaires, but I'm not a billionaire, so, you know, for me, the next steps are scary. I'm trying to stay focused working productively, but it's a scary moment,"" Hickman said.
Hickman said she believes Musk is attempting to ""destroy"" the agency started by Congress. But she and several of her former colleagues vowed to continue fighting, looking into all available legal options, because she said that's what civil servants do.
""Civil servants do this work to fight for regular Americans,"" she said. ""That's what the job is. That's why it's intended to be insulated from partisan swings. That's why it requires expert people skills and experience, and that's why there are these protections around the jobs. I mean, we are people who go to work every day to fight for regular people.""
CFPB employs the ""cops on the beat for the financial market,"" according to Hickman. She said her job was critical to safeguarding the public from financial market crashes, loan schemes and hiked interest rates.
""Donald Trump and Elon Musk can just call their lawyers,"" Hickman said. ""But regular people don't just have a lawyer they can call, and these agencies are intended to fill that gap and to keep people safe. … For me, this was, you know, a calling.
""It was something that I felt really passionate about doing in this next phase of my career,"" she added. ""I've been in private practice for 15 years before this, and this is just a whole different type of practice -- and one that was incredibly fulfilling for me before I was terminated.""


Earlier this week, ABC News spoke to several other federal government probationary employees who had been fired by receiving notices that said: ""The Agency finds, based on your performance, that you have not demonstrated that your further employment at the Agency would be in the public interest.""
Chelsea Milburn, a disabled veteran, said she was fired on Wednesday from the Department of Education via a memo that ""didn't give any specific reasons as to why"" she was let go.
""I was definitely upset,"" Milburn told ABC News. ""I've only ever gotten positive feedback from my team and leadership, so I was pretty surprised to get that email.""
A former Federal Student Aid probationary hire at the Department of Education received an unexpected call on Wednesday from a supervisor who was on the other line crying. The supervisor told the former probationary employee: ""I'm getting word that you've been terminated.""
The person, who spoke with ABC News on the condition of anonymity for fear of it affecting future employment opportunities, said it is ""devastating"" and they don't know where, or when, their next paycheck will come from.
""It was heartbreaking,"" the former employee said. ""When I went up to my computer, it was already locked down. I couldn't access anything. I'm still trying to reach out to HR to find out, do I get a severance package? What is my health insurance benefits? When does it end? Nobody knows anything.""

Legitimate model leakers may already have Nintendo Switch 2 before its release later this year.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The Chinese leaker who posted CAD images of the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 claims to have a functioning unit for sale. The mysterious seller (via Reddit) allegedly offers the unreleased next-generation console to an accessory manufacturer for about $39,800.
The design from the leaked CAD files seems to have been used by Dbrand and other pre-reveal Switch 2 accessory manufacturers. The leaker would seem to be the most legitimate source, as the console's final design in its reveal video perfectly matched the Dbrand-corroborated leak. Nonetheless, we still recommend treating the information with some salt.
The leaker, who uses the Xiaohongshu forums, told the interested buyer that he or she could experiment with the Switch 2 dock, joystick, and tablet. He also claimed that Pro controllers would become available next week, potentially Nintendo's follow-up to its official Switch Pro peripheral.
So, will he cough up the dough to access a complete pre-release Switch 2? It may depend on how much money he can make from the endeavor. Full early access to Nintendo Switch 2 hardware could help several cases and peripheral manufacturers— legitimate or otherwise— get an early crack at the hardware and make appropriate accessories for their purposes.
Of course, dealing with stacks of cash like this on the black market, it would seem likely that our CAD design leaker would also demand quite a healthy sum from any prospective Switch 2 flash cart (or other unofficial accessory) manufacturer for each session with such a high-value piece of hardware.
After all, there's no other reason for someone to want a pre-release Nintendo Switch 2. Games enhanced on Switch 2 will likely need Pro-console-esque patches to enable the functionality. Of course, no Switch 2 games will become available, even in physical form, until much closer to the release date. However, the console, especially if it will be shipping with the same out-of-box operating system, seems quite open to the potential of pre-release exploitation and development, considering the details of this story.
Hopefully, Nintendo will confirm a proper release date soon. However, it would be funny if that release date were so far in the future that this early buyer's purchase would be irrelevant.

31,2025-02-15,"On January 2nd, I made a bold prediction in Forbes that Airbnb would change the way we travel in 2025. And on Valentine’s Day Airbnb’s stock surged 14% in a single day. For a larger travel brand that’s an unusual jump in market capitalization.

Can AI allow consumers increased access to localize their journey? You bet. It can increase the total size of the travel pie and potentially enable consumers to shift more easily from one brand to another.
According to Kayak’s CEO Steve Hafner, 2025 is expected to witness a pivotal shift where the first successful commercial agreement between an AI engine and a major travel player could act like ""a dam breaking."" Disruptor brands have the potential to take share as the adoption of new technology increases access.
According to NerdWallet, Marriott is one of the best known loyalty brands in the world. I’ll confess I have been a heavy Marriott user and so are millions of Marriott loyalists. With over 210 Million members in the aggregate their size in numbers would approximate the country of Brazil which is the 7th largest country in the world. Brazil’s population and Marriott’s membership are similar.
But am I truly loyal? I stay at Marriott on probably 80% or more of my travel. I am paying for that with a company credit card or rebilling my clients. My stays are usually 1-3 nights and the brand nearly always delivers a great customer experience in a location that matters a lot at a price point that is less important. I don’t want to overspend but I have relatively high price elasticity.
What happens when I want to stay somewhere 4-7 nights and don’t require the restaurant and pool at the hotel?
I am paying for all of the overhead at the hotel I really like. If I’m staying longer and want to explore the local environment the location matters just as much but the price starts to become a bigger factor.

My thesis is a bit different than many on Airbnb.
As a strategy and innovation professional I like to look at brand permission.
A brief explanation on brand permission is “would consumers trust your brand and how far will that trust extend?” When you innovate on need states, use cases, palette states, dayparts or other factors specific to travel, brand permission becomes a critical factor.
For example, I may trust Nike to introduce a new running shoe or even apparel, but I may not consider Nike if they create a financial planning service. Nike’s brand permission is high and certainly allows them to move from athletic shoes to apparel and even to hard goods. But it doesn’t mean Nike can just open a bank, operate an airplane or buy a beer brand that their raving fans will trust.
In the case of a younger consumer, Gen Z often looks at the following factors related to travel and travel lodging:

 “AI can help travelers quickly sort through their preferences and seamlessly stitch together what has traditionally been a very siloed experience into a cohesive plan,” said Mindtrip CEO Andy Moss. “In 2025, this capability will be supercharged as we enter the early days of agentic booking and voice-to-voice interactions, making anything possible.”
I love brands that have the potential to create an unfair advantage. Think about brands that often create unfair advantage by building a more unique business model: Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, Chewy and others. Brands that have more indirect competitors and fewer direct competitors often fit the category of “unfair advantage.”
So while I’m open to the idea of couch surfing to save a lot on my lodging expense I haven’t pursued it in my decades of business and leisure travel. My alternatives are largely hotels, VRBO or Airbnb.
I think it would be super inexpensive to couch surf. I also absolutely relish a stay at a Ritz Carlton but would I stay for a week if the cost was materially different, I’m paying for it and the location was materially the same as the indirect alternatives?
In my view, Airbnb will create high value-added partnerships that are both innovative and align to the brands value proposition.
Imagine if Airbnb could help you:
Airbnb doesn’t have to build out all the technology, but they have to “localize” the brand and help the consumer achieve a better experience, save them a little time, put a few extra bucks in their pocket and have a more local and authentic experience.
""Airbnb has a unique opportunity in that their brand is ultimately 'controlled’ by more than 5 million hosts. This gives them the opportunity to win or lose based on how well they deliver on their brand promise and localize the experience. As we move into more shared brand models, this will become crucial."" Nancy A Shenker, Publisher of BleisureLiving.com.
“Our strong Q4 results are a testament to a ton of hard work from our teams,” remarked Dave Stephenson Airbnb Chief Business Officer. I think in addition to hard work Airbnb has built an unfair advantage that will appeal to discretionary, leisure travelers.
Time will tell but I’d bet on Airbnb’s ability to leverage their brand permission as well as localize the consumer journey. With the AI tail winds creating a bigger travel pie as well as increased access for tech savvy consumers, we may be hearing from Airbnb again.

32,2025-02-15,"Social media on display with Trade war
President Trump has been talking about tariffs since 1989, when he advocated for a 15% to 20% tax on imports from Japan because of unfair trade practices. This is how he describes Canada, China, Mexico and Europe today.
Trump has already imposed a 10% levy on Chinese imports. Meanwhile, Mexico and Canada have secured a 30-day reprieve from planned 25% tariffs, contingent upon their commitments to bolster border security and curb the flow of illicit drugs into the United States.
More tariffs are coming. Trump says he is willing to take the short-term pain for potential benefits.
We contrarians don’t have to grit our teeth and suffer with stocks that are suddenly tariff losers. We will continue to sidestep companies with supply chain risk as we load up on a backdoor bullish play: bonds.
The 10-year Treasury yield has traded lower since the initial tariff news. Here’s why—tariffs are a short-term headwind on growth. Contrary to popular belief that these levies are inflationary, a recent study shows otherwise. The Centre for Economic Policy Research found that tariffs do not boost inflation because rising prices depend on a hot economy—and a trade war does the opposite.
The Financial Times recently reached a similar conclusion. Yes, tariffs compress company margins due to upward wage pressure and higher costs. But these are typically absorbed by the firms—and their shareholders!
Bond investors agree. The 10-year yield has yet again hit its head just below the “5% ceiling.” If tariffs were really inflationary, wouldn’t the bond market have freaked out and demanded higher yields? The opposite has happened:
Rate Ceiling - 5%
In a steady-to-falling long rate environment, we are happy to own bonds and their proxies—such as preferred stocks and their fat payouts.
Preferreds are called “hybrid” investments because they share qualities of both common stock and bonds. For instance, we buy preferreds on a stock exchange (like common stocks), and they represent ownership in a company (like common stocks). But their dividends are fixed (like bonds), they’re extremely sensitive to interest rates (like bonds), and their price activity is much more similar to bonds.
And as a general rule, as bonds go, so go preferreds.
However, our best way to buy isn’t through individual preferreds, but closed-end funds (CEFs).
Preferred CEFs not only enable us to diversify across hundreds or thousands of preferred shares by purchasing a single fund—they also allow us to buy those preferreds at a discount to their net asset value (NAV). Plus, rather than doing the digging ourselves, we’re offloading the work to one or more expert managers. Not a bad deal!
For example, here are three preferred CEFs currently yielding between 6.9% and 10.5% that we can buy on the cheap.
Cohen & Steers Limited Duration Preferred and Income Fund (LDP)Distribution Rate: 7.5%Discount to NAV: 4.9%
I want to start with an oddity in the preferred space: the Cohen & Steers Limited Duration Preferred and Income Fund (LDP).
The view from 10,000 feet isn’t anything abnormal. LDP isn’t U.S.-centric, but a “global” preferred portfolio, split roughly 55/45 between domestic and international preferreds. It’s heavy in financials, which is par for the course. Credit quality is similar to a standard vanilla preferred fund.
Where things start to get weird is the “limited duration” objective. The average preferred stock is perpetual in nature. In other words, it doesn’t have an expiration date, so duration isn’t really part of the picture. But LDP owns preferreds that do have listed maturities, and it explicitly targets those preferred shares that have low duration, which should help reduce interest-rate risk.
Gauging that is a little difficult. This Cohen & Steers fund’s average modified duration is 4.5 years (an oversimplified explanation: a percentage-point hike in interest rates would clip LDP’s price by 4.5%). Well, many preferred funds don’t even list a duration, though for what it’s worth, the Morningstar category average for preferred-stock funds is nearly 6 years, and that’s riskier than LDP.
We also get a couple of other meaningful differences:
Historically, all of the above has led to a more turbulent chart than its ETF peers, but a bigger pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred Securities (FFC)Distribution Rate: 6.9%Discount to NAV: 6.8%
Flaherty & Crumrine Preferred Securities (FFC) is a pretty standard-issue preferred CEF. The financial sector is about 80% of assets, but 25% is wrapped up in insurance companies, which don’t have the same liquidity issues some banks can run across if customers decide to withdraw all at once.
It’s also a global fund—FFC has a larger U.S. allocation (70%), but there are still plenty of big foreign financials from developed countries represented here, including BNP Paribas (BNPQY), Banco Santander (SAN) and Societe Generale (SCGLY).
Overall credit quality is a little lower than DFP and most standard preferred ETFs, with about 5-10 percentage points less in investment-grade preferreds.
And management is downright aggressive with leverage, which is just south of 40% right now.
As one might imagine, lower credit quality and high leverage has historically led to a lot of wobble in this fund, but long-term, the wobble has been more than worth it.
FFC Total Returns
FFC’s pricing has been all over the place—its five-year average is just 1%, but it traded at a double-digit discount within the past year. It currently sits roughly in between right now, at about 93 cents on the dollar.
Nuveen Variable Rate Preferred & Income Fund (NPFD)Distribution Rate: 10.5%Discount to NAV: 4.9%
Preferreds offer high yield, but it’s still extremely rare to see a double-digit payout in the space. But that’s not the only reason Nuveen Variable Rate Preferred & Income Fund (NPFD) is so interesting.
While many preferred stocks pay a fixed dividend, some are issued with variable rates. NPFD homes in on these and other variable-rate income-producing securities. That said, the lion’s share of its assets aren’t in true floating-rate securities. Roughly three-quarters of assets are invested in “fixed-to-fixed rate securities,” which step from one rate to another based on a set schedule. Another 15% or so are in fixed-to-floating rate securities, which start with a fixed coupon that it pays for a few years before switching to a variable-rate coupon. Only about 4% of the fund is invested in pure variable-rate preferreds.
Past that, the portfolio is a 65/35 U.S./international blend of primarily financial stocks. Credit quality is quite high—nearly 75% of assets are investment-grade, including nearly 10% in A-rated preferreds. And it’s also happy to use plenty of debt (37% leverage at present) to double down on its investments and boost its monthly distribution.
Yet at first glance, it would appear that this Nuveen fund isn’t quite up to snuff with FFC and LDP.
NPFD Total Returns
But context is key. Remember: 2022-23 was brutal for preferreds as a whole! This CEF simply had the misfortune of coming to life on Dec. 15, 2021, just before the market for preferred stocks took a nosedive. In fact, it’s the only one of these three funds to sport a positive total return since NPFD’s inception date.
That said, Wall Street isn’t sleeping on NPFD anymore. Within the past year, shares could be bought for 85 cents on the dollar—but now that discount sits at a slimmer 5%.

According to the consumer price index, inflation rose higher than expected in January 2025, hitting 3% year-over-year instead of the expected 2.9%. While the Federal Reserve was originally expected to continue 2024's trend of lowering interest rates, rising inflation might continue to put a pause in rate drops.
Even with an uncertain financial future, there are still ways to keep earning interest on your cash meantime. High-yield savings accounts, checking accounts, and CDs from local financial institutions offer extremely high interest rates from 9% to 10% Annual Percentage Yield (APY). All of these accounts come with limitations, additional requirements, and drawbacks, but if you qualify for one, you'll earn a great interest rate.
The highest interest rate you can get on a deposit account right now is from the Community Financial Credit Union High Yield Savings Account, with an interest rate of up to 10.00% APY. This high-yield savings account also happens to have the least requirements to earn that rate of any of the institutions on our list.
The biggest hurdle to earning this rate is that you need to be a member of the credit union to open the account. To become a member, you need to live, work, attend school, or worship in Michigan. You can also join if your immediate family member is eligible to join or if you live in the same household as a current member. Businesses can join if they regularly conduct business in Michigan.
Once you've opened the account, you'll automatically earn a 10% annual percentage yield on the first $1,000 in the account. You don't need to meet any requirements to earn that rate, but you'll only earn 0.05% APY on amounts over $1,000 — that's significantly less than the average savings account rate.
You might not want to have it as your primary savings account, but the Community Financial Credit Union High Yield Savings Account's high interest rate makes it worthwhile as a low-risk way to earn a high rate on $1,000 for Michigan residents.

If you're interested in opening a fixed-rate account, the California Coast Credit Union Celebration Certificate offers one of the best CD rates you can find, with a rate of 9.50% APY. This CD has been around for several months.
To join the credit union, you'll need to live or work in San Diego, Riverside, Orange, Los Angeles, Ventura, Imperial, or San Bernadino counties in California. If you live in another county in California, you might prefer one of the other best banks and credit unions in California.
This 5-month CD comes with a significant number of requirements to open. Once you're a member, you'll need to open the account with at least $500 but no more than $3,000. You have to use new money, which is money that isn't currently in a California Coast Credit Union account, and you can only open one certificate per Social Security number.
You'll also have to have one of the following accounts with California Coast Credit Union:
Note that none of the listed deposit accounts have very high interest rates, so you'll dilute the interest rate you earn overall if you open one of the accounts with minimum balance requirements.
There is currently one high-yield checking account with a very high interest rate: the Farmers Savings Bank Star Checking account. You can earn up to up to 9.01% APY from this account, but you'll need to open it in person at a Farmers Savings Bank branch. You can find branches in the following Iowa cities: Arlington, Colesburg, Elgin, Elkport, Strawberry Point, and Wadena.
In order to earn the high interest rate, you'll need to make at least 15 debit card transactions each month (not including ATM transactions), have at least one direct deposit or automatic withdrawal each month, and turn on eStatements. You'll earn the top interest rate on the first $4,000 in the account if you meet those requirements. If you meet those requirements, balances over $4,000 will earn an APY of 0.32%; otherwise, your entire balance will only earn 0.05% APY.

If you don't qualify for any of these local accounts, you can still find high rates from the best banks and credit unions nationwide.
Right now, it's easier to find high interest rates from variable-rate accounts, like high-yield savings accounts and high-yield checking accounts, than fixed-rate accounts, like CDs, from nationwide banks and credit unions. Banks and credit unions are still expecting interest rates to go down, and they don't want to be locked into a high rate down the line, especially with long-term CDs such as 5-year CDs.
The best rates for savings accounts from online banks and credit unions are in the 4.50% to 5.00% APY range, while the best nationwide banks and credit unions offer CDs with rates around 4.00% to 4.60% APY, depending on the CD's term length.
If you're going to traditional brick-and-mortar banks with generally low rates, though, you're still likely to find CDs with better interest rates than savings accounts. According to the FDIC's average bank account interest rates, the average savings account rate is 0.41% APY, while the average interest rates for 3-month to 5-year CDs range from 1.24% to 1.82% APY. That's because traditional banks tend to offer very low rates on savings accounts while offering rates closer to online bank rates for CDs.

35,2025-02-15,"One of Lagardère Travel Retail's extensive store operations at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport.
French media-to-retail titan Lagardère Group* saw its share price close the week at a 2025 high of €21.90 up almost 10% on Thursday thanks to a strong sales uplift at its biggest division, Lagardère Travel Retail, the main store operator at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. The business is, however, considering restructuring its North Asia operations.
The duty-free business—which is most active in European airports but also owns Paradies in the U.S. after a 2015 acquisition—saw its revenue jump by almost 16% (12.5% like-for-like) to €5.8 billion ($6.1 billion). Recurring EBIT reached an all-time high of €305 million ($320 million), surging by 24.5%.
The EBIT result allowed the travel retail business to catch up with its sister division, Lagardère Publishing which generated €310 million but grew more slowly at 3% year-over-year. The more balanced picture and all-around growth have encouraged investors despite the higher capital expenditure needed for the travel retail business to ensure future organic growth.
The travel retail result helped push Lagardère Group revenue to €8.9 billion last year, up 10.6% (8.5% like-for-like). Lagardère’s CEO Arnaud Lagardère said in a statement: “Travel retail is benefiting fully from the growth in air traffic thanks to its three complementary businesses—travel essentials, duty-free and fashion, and dining.”
Lagardère Travel Retail has also expanded its operations through acquisitions such as Tastes on the Fly in the United States by Paradies, and airport concession wins including a big one at Amsterdam Schiphol which starts on 1 May, Düsseldorf in Germany, Atlanta, and Nice. The division now has more than 5,000 points of sale around the world.
In an investor call, Grégoire Castaing assistant managing director of Lagardère Group since June 2024 and its financial head, said that travel retail had seen “another remarkable year” but acknowledged that Asia Pacific was still problematic.
Lagardère Travel Retail's portfolio is well balanced in terms of activity. 
The EMEA region (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) excluding France, saw growth up 20% on the back of strong passenger traffic increases especially in Italy at Rome’s Fiumicino Airport together with concept refreshes and new contracts. France grew by 15% helped by the success of a number of joint ventures such as Extime Duty Free with Group ADP at its main air gateways to Paris.
The Americas were less dynamic with 6% growth while Asia-Pacific was down by 13% due to weak consumer demand as a direct result of the slowdown in the Chinese economy which led to store closures in North Asia. Lagardère has been renegotiating its contracts in the mainland China market because of poor performances there. Castaing said: “The situation in China is affecting several players and (for) many, more than us.”
During the investor call, Lagardère Travel Retail CEO Dag Rasmussen said that 2025 had started well. In January, usually a weak month, like-for-like sales were up 9%. “The momentum is very good and more generally we will have the full effect of some openings like Romania, but also the start of operations at Amsterdam Schiphol.”
The Amsterdam joint venture contract is a potential game-changer as it runs for 10 years at one of the world’s busiest international airports. This offers scope for a considerable sales uplift for Lagardère starting from the second quarter.
Meanwhile in Asia, a review is underway. “We are considering restructuring our North Asian operation but the costs have been accounted for in 2024,” Rasmussen added, without detailing what changes are coming. North Asia refers to China, but in the wider Asia-Pacific region several structural rejigs by rivals such as Gebr. Heinemann are now underway.
Fielding a question about driving up Lagardère Travel Retail’s operating profit margin even further—it has risen from 3.5% in 2022 to 5.3% last year—the CEO was cautious. “We posted a record high of 5.3% in 2024. We could go somewhat higher, but not significantly. We have big new openings which are costly and sometimes it is also a question of tenders so we have come to a level we consider as stable,” he said.
* Lagardère Group is now part of a new entity, Louis Hachette Group, following a large shareholding from media conglomerate Vivendi being broken up. Louis Hachette shares began trading on the Euronext Growth (Paris) exchange in mid-December 2024. The new company has a 66.53% stake in Lagardère SA and a 100% stake in Prisma Media, a leading French publisher.

Quick takes on capital markets
The Trump administration’s bold policy initiatives to increase government efficiency and tighten immigration will likely have macroeconomic consequences for the labor market, potentially weighing on labor demand and supply. However, the combined effect will likely also be very nuanced,  suggesting the data over the coming months will be difficult to parse and understand, making policymaking even more challenging for the Fed.
The Trump administration has unleashed bold policy initiatives on government efficiency and immigration that are likely to impact the labor market, though in a very nuanced way.
Plans for a wide-scale reduction in government workforce would likely have limited direct impact, especially as the federal workforce only makes up 2% of total nonfarm payrolls. Moreover, while government jobs have increasingly driven payroll gains in recent years—making up 23% of jobs created since August 2022—only 3% is attributable to the federal government.
Outsourced government work has grown significantly, however, so a reduction in contract spending could pose bigger challenges. Such a reduction would likely dampen labor demand for impacted downstream industries, including professional services, healthcare, and transportation.
Meanwhile, the administration’s goal to implement stricter immigration measures is unlikely to meaningfully impact the flow of labor, especially as immigration flows had already begun normalizing in late-2024.
However, with foreign-born labor making up over half of labor force growth since 2023, increased immigration crackdowns could significantly affect the stock of labor. Tighter immigration policy could reduce labor supply in industries most reliant on immigrant labor: construction, accommodation and food services.
The combined effect of these policies will likely make the labor data over the coming months difficult to parse and understand. Already having to navigate tariff uncertainties, this only makes policymaking even more challenging for the Fed.

38,2025-02-15,"CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA - SEPTEMBER 12:  The new iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max are displayed ... [+] during an Apple event on September 12, 2023 in Cupertino, California. Apple revealed its lineup of the latest iPhone 15 versions as well as other product upgrades during the event. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)
Roughly a fifth of Apple’s iPhones are sold in China. Repeat the previous anecdote over and over again, and ideally convey it to Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Matt Pottinger, chairman of the China program at Foundation for Defense of Democracies.
Recently the duo penned an opinion piece asserting that “Legislators on both sides of the aisle recognize that the U.S. must lead the world in artificial intelligence to preserve national security.” There’s no evidence or logic supporting such a claim. See above.
It’s not just that what’s designed in Cupertino is easily accessible at a market price in China, it’s that all global production is available globally. If countries are fully open, or even partially open to foreign production, the latter is the equivalent of all the world’s production taking place next door. Stated simply, if you’re selling what you produce, you’re trading with the world.
Amodei and Pottinger believe that the U.S. must lead in AI, but that’s no more rational than saying that the U.S. must lead in banana production. In each instance, the production of a market good is made available to the world as though it was produced in parts of the world where it’s being sold.
Easily the best evidence in support of the above claim can be found in U.S. technology companies feverishly working to discover the future of AI. In 2025 alone, Google and Amazon plan to respectively spend $75 and $100 billion on AI and AI-adjacent investment. And they’re hardly alone.
About these massive capital outlays by U.S.-based companies, does anyone seriously think their shareholders would allow them to expend such copious sums if their intent was to sit on the market-oriented advances discovered? Hopefully the question answers itself, at which point it should and will be said that what U.S. technological innovators produce will be made available to the rest of the world as though it was created in the rest of the world.
Importantly, what’s true about American innovation is also true about what takes place in China. See DeepSeek. It quickly became a global story a few weeks ago not just because the quality of the app rivaled some of the best-known American names, but because Americans were rapidly downloading it for usage as though – yes – it had been created right in northern California.
About DeepSeek’s advance, it was noted at the time that AI app was created with less powerful Nvidia chips since export controls had limited what Nvidia could export to “China.” This rates mention since Amodei and Pottinger believe that “The U.S. needs proactive development efforts and strong export controls.” The CEO and the scholar err twice, at least.
For one, short of Nvidia ceasing sales of its chips altogether, they’ll reach China if the producers there want to utilize them. In other words, superfluous rules crafted by politicians can limit whom Nvidia sells to, but not those Nvidia sells to. Second, the quickest way to stunt the growth of AI in both the U.S. and China would be for both countries to do as Amodei and Pottinger wish whereby they place the discovery of future innovation in the hands of politicians. Industrial policy fails, always and everywhere.
Most troubling of all is the underlying thinking informing what Amodei and Pottinger want to do. They aim for export controls as part of a bigger “national security” strategy, when in reality trade among producers is easily the most peaceful concept ever conceived by mankind. Which means we should be grateful for free-flowing markets that will work around their central plans, along with shareholders who would never allow companies invested in to limit their genius solely to the country they’re headquartered in."
39,2025-02-15,"Stock market declines start unexpectedly
The stock market's behavior is the gauge by which we can measure Wall Street's attitude and outlook. Clearly, today's reading continues to be one of bullish optimism.
However, there is a problem with following Wall Street's current enthusiasm. The four bullish views cited as reasons to own stocks carry the risk of having reality chip away at the optimistic rationale.
First is artificial intelligence. Like the many unique developments throughout history, AI has created a widespread rush of action, ideas, strategies, forecasts and money - particularly equity financing so everybody can get rich. Importantly, the initial stage typically supports widespread bullishness as most of the equity investments blossom. They are boosted by both positive expectations and Wall Street's optimism. However, reality eventually spoils the fun, and the excessive bullish activities begin their inevitable shakeout.
Second is inflation. Today's consensus is that inflation is mostly defeated, so the Federal Reserve need not tighten money and raise interest rates. However, the U.S. and other developed countries are now in self-sustaining inflation cycles. The proof is in the amount of price raising that has compounded throughout the economies. Price rises for producers/sellers mean cost rises for users/buyers, thereby leading to a chain of more price/cost rises. Additionally, labor, the initial laggard in inflation adjusting, is now fully engaged in the inflation cycle, thus helping raise costs more.
When in an inflation cycle, the 12-month inflation rate is misleading. Instead, it is the compounded inflation rate from the cycle's beginning that matters to all parties. Thus, the current commentary about a 12-month 3% rise is irrelevant. Instead, it is the large, 5-year 22% inflation in this Covid period that counts. Why? Because the various parties are in different stages of trying keep up with, catch up to, or get ahead of the inflation cycle.
Third is the U.S. Government debt. In November 2023, Moody's put the U.S. debt rating on a negative outlook. However, that old news has been left behind. After all, Moody's never followed through.
But rating agencies rarely act precipitously, particularly about a country's debt rating. That means the past reasons for their negative viewpoint are still relevant. Moreover, the political situation (my underlining, below) has become more critical.
""New York, November 10, 2023 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) has today changed the outlook on Government of United States of America's (US) ratings to negative from stable and affirmed the long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings at Aaa.
""The key driver of the outlook change to negative is Moody's assessment that the downside risks to the US' fiscal strength have increased and may no longer be fully offset by the sovereign's unique credit strengths. In the context of higher interest rates, without effective fiscal policy measures to reduce government spending or increase revenues, Moody's expects that the US' fiscal deficits will remain very large, significantly weakening debt affordability. Continued political polarization within US Congress raises the risk that successive governments will not be able to reach consensus on a fiscal plan to slow the decline in debt affordability.""
Fourth is Donald Trump's presidency. Trump's election and inauguration produced stock market optimism. The key expectation was for an improved business environment. However, the post-election political environment has increased uncertainty markedly (and the stock market dislikes uncertainty).
Uncertainty's sharp rise has been caused by the dramatic scope, size and seriousness of the actions being taken. Moreover, the decisions and steps taken diverge significantly from normality. Heightening that considerable uncertainty is the widespread removal and replacement of career government employees and officers.

John Richardson, a 68-year-old retiree from Michigan, feels like there's a lot of money to be made in the stock market right now.

        Richardson, an active swing trader who's been managing his own retirement accounts since 2019, told Business Insider this week that he expects the Trump administration to drive a lot of volatility across sectors this year, creating big opportunities for gains. 
    

        He's eyeing stocks exposed to nuclear energy, AI data centers, and rare earth minerals.
    

        ""The reason people are getting in is because they kind of remember the wild rides of 2018 and 2019, and I think they think with all the White House rhetoric and tariffs, there's just gonna be a lot of opportunities,"" Richardson said.
    

        ""Whatever Trump says seems to spark something,"" he added.
    

        Richardson is among a throng of retail investors who are hitting the market in 2025 as stocks look to extend their bull rally to a third year. 
    

        Data from JPMorgan published last week found that retail traders have broken records since Donald Trump's inauguration, investing billions of dollars in the market on various trading days earlier this month.
    

        ""Their daily inflow exceeded $2B twice last week - a level reached only 9 times in the past 3 years with 5 times occurring this year after the Inauguration,"" JPMorgan analyst Emma Wu said.
    

        JPMorgan's proprietary retail sentiment score zoomed to about 4.0 earlier this month, the highest level on record and about one point higher than the meme-mania peak in 2021.
    

        George B., a 32-year-old tech worker from Indiana, is riding the Trump wave in the stock market.
    

        He told BI that he's been actively trading his investment portfolio ""a lot more than usual"" since Trump won the election in November and expects Trump-induced volatility to create plenty of opportunities this year.
    

        One of those opportunities has been Robinhood stock, which George owns. The stock soared earlier this week on a strong earnings report, which was driven by a surge in retail trading activity in both stocks and cryptocurrencies.
    

        But while the data shows activity is high and sentiment is bullish, there are still cautious traders to be found among the retail cohort. 
    

        Ben Hunt, a recently retired digital marketer from Pikeville, Kentucky, said he's been slowly taking money out of the stock market since Trump's election win.
    

        ""I've been a seller for the past three months,"" Hunt said. ""Long term, I'm bullish forever, but over the next few quarters or even a year to 18 months, I'm being a little more cautious.""
    

        Hunt said his portfolio is about 30% cash, and he plans to increase that to about 50% by the end of March.
    

        He said he was able to retire at 46 thanks in part to gains in his stock portfolio, and his hesitation to be all in on the stock market right now is due to uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's agenda.


        Ideally, Hunt said he would redeploy the cash after a market sell-off, but he'll jump right back into the stock market if he is wrong.
    

        ""To be a good investor, you have to have perspective, and sometimes your thesis is wrong and you have to be able to adapt,"" Hunt said. ""I'm willing to buy higher and sell higher after that.""
    

        William Mangum, a 26-year-old supply chain manager from Columbia, South Carolina, first entered the trading world in 2021.
    

        ""I had no idea what I was doing. It was right around the time the whole GameStop debacle happened,"" Mangum said. ""I've been trying to figure out everything since then.""
    

        After a couple of years of trial and error, Mangum said things have started to ""click"" in his trading, which has seen an increase in activity since he secured full-time employment in 2024.
    

        In 2025, Mangum said he's scouring the market for opportunities away from the most crowded trades. He views mega-cap tech companies as ""priced for perfection"" and expects them to underperform the broader market for the year.
    

        ""I think small caps are the way to go this year,"" Mangum said. His main strategy is to look for companies that are trading below their IPO price and are on the verge of profitability.
    

        Stocks on his radar include Joby Aviation, Archer Aviation, and BlackBerry.
    

        With the recent surge in pandemic-era darlings like Palantir and Robinhood, there seems to be a flavor of speculation in the markets that is reminiscent of the post-COVID boom times, when retail traders were highly active before the crushing 2022 bear market.
    

        But that's not necessarily a signal to sell, Hunt said. 
    

        ""I don't think we've reached the point of a blow-off top or complete exuberance just yet. There's still quite a bit of pessimism and fear out there, and I call that keeping the porridge just right. I feel like we're still sort of in that sweet spot,"" Hunt said.
    

        Recent sentiment data aligns with Hunt's thinking. The CNN Fear And Greed Indicator is ping-ponging between the ""Fear"" and ""Neutral"" zones. The most recent AAII Investor Sentiment Survey showed a 52-week high in bearish responses, and sentiment for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 is in ""Extremely Bearish"" territory, according to data from Stocktwits.
    

        Richardson, who's noticed a jump in online chatter among retail traders, had some advice for his peers.
    

        ""Retail has to remember, things go up fast and they go down fast. Take your profits and don't be greedy,"" he said.

China has experienced decades of sustained economic growth – “the most impressive economic miracle of any economy in history” – But is it coming to an end?
A prolonged downturn would have major geopolitical implications.
Many observers have compared China’s current malaise to the grinding economic stagnation that Japan suffered in the decades following the crash of its real estate market in 1990.
How real is this dire analogy, often called “Japanification”?
Consider the parallels.

Equity markets mirror the overall economy, often more accurately than official statistics. The CSI 300 – considered the Chinese equivalent of the S&P500 - is down 36% from its all-time peak four years ago this month.

China's Stock Market Crash

This is somewhat less drastic than the plunge in Japan’s Nikkei 225 from its peak in December 1989, but the correlation is strong.

Comparison of the Stock Market Crashes in Japan and China 

Stocks got a bounce from the Communist Party’s Third Plenum in mid-July, 2025. This is a meeting of the leadership of the Party, held every five years, at which important economic policy decisions are announced. The July session was described in advance as “a milestone moment in China’s history” where it was widely anticipated that the government would announce a shift towards a strong economic stimulus.
The brief bubble deflated quickly, as disappointment with the government’s weak policy response set in.
The Market Dismisses the Government's Stimulus Plans
What does the future hold? The Japanese stock market slide in the early 1990’s stabilized somewhat at the 4-year mark (although it fell further afterwards).

The Future Path of the CSI 300

Will Chinese equities continue to track this trajectory? Geopolitical uncertainties, tariff and trade measures, and the prospect of tension with both the U.S. and the EU, all suggest further “moderation” ahead.
The Economist describes it as “history’s wildest property boom” – and it is now “history” indeed. The boom is well over, and China’s housing crisis lies at the heart of the current economic downturn. Real estate prices have collapsed. Companies responsible for 40% of China’s home sales are in default.
The parallel with Japan’s real estate crash in the 1990’s is striking although Chinese housing prices have fallen much faster.

Japan vs China, Real Residential Property Prices
Hong Kong housing prices show an even sharper decline. (Economic statistics provided by Hong Kong are generally considered more reliable than figures supplied by Beijing.)
The effects of real estate crashes are very prolonged. In the United States, it took 15 years for residential property prices to recover back to the pre-crash peak set in Q3 2006. In Japan, Spain, and Ireland (countries which experienced major housing bubbles), prices never fully recovered. If this is any indication, China’s housing crisis is only in its early stages.
The Future Path of the Chinese Housing Crisis
In addition, the overhang of unsold inventory is enormous, especially relative to current sales rates.
(As a point of reference, the value of unsold housing inventory in the U.S. at the peak of the subprime crisis in 2007/8 was about $1 trillion, or 7% of the U.S. GDP at the time. China’s backlog is more than 10 times larger, equivalent to about 70% of China’s current GDP.)

The debt picture in China is sharply bifurcated. Trends in government indebtedness are quite different from trends in private sector indebtedness. Public sector debt expands in a crisis as a result of fiscal stimulus and relief programs. The private sector sees an opposite trend, as companies retrench and pay down debts to defend and rebuild their balance sheets.

A key aspect of “Japanification” is the rapid growth of government debt. Following the onset of the economic stress, both Japan and China show a strong upward inflection in government debt as a percentage of GDP.

General Govt Debt as % of GDP, China vs Japan
(In China’s case, 2015 is chosen is Year 0. That was when official GDP growth fell to 5% for the first time in the “open China” era, a distinct slowdown after having averaged 15% annually for the previous two decades).
Japan entered its crisis with a higher level of public debt, but China’s debt level has accelerated faster.
Rate of Increase of Public Debt - China vs Japan

Corporate debt typically grows prior to the crisis. Infact, this accumulation of leverage helps create the conditions for the crisis that ensues. The trend slows and reverses as the downturn sets in. In Japan after 1990, corporate profits were squeezed. Corporate borrowing slowed, and after a few years companies begin to deleverage aggressively. It was a “balance sheet recession” as identified by economist Richard Koo. Many Japanese firms went into survival mode and focused on paying down their debt rather than investing for growth. This shift to thrift was a major contributor to Japanification.

Private Sector Debt in China and Japan

China’s private sector has not started serious deleveraging yet. But it seems to be poised on the threshold of a similar shift. After expanding indebtedness from 87% of GDP in 2007 to 141% of GDP in 2023, borrowings appear to have slowed. If this is followed by a major deleveraging, it will create a significant drag on economic growth.

Another symptom of Japanification is a significant decline in bond yields, reflecting a general “flight to safety” by investors shifting from risk assets (like stocks) to haven assets (government bonds). As demand for bonds surges, prices rise and yields fall.
Japan (in the 1990s) and China today show a similar pattern. In China’s case, bond yields have fallen to an all-time low, and many observers are diagnosing a dangerous “bubble” in the bond market.
Bond Yields, China vs Japan
A strong bond market is not a straightforward sign of economic health. The bond rally here is linked to private sector’s shift to thrift. Banks are buying bonds because they can’t generate new loans to a private sector which doesn’t want to borrow.
As the rally becomes a speculative bubble – that is, as investors and traders start to bet on a continuing uptrend in the bond market – it starts to make things worse. Surging demand for government bonds sucks even potentially willing investment capital out of the economy and parks it in unproductive hands (the government’s coffers).
The situation mirrors the gloom in the stock market and the housing market.
A consequence of the bond bubble is that Chinese yields have fallen now more than 320 basis points below the yield on U.S Treasurys – a shift of more than 550 basis points in the spread in the last four years.

Chinese Bond Yield Spread vs U.S. Treasurys
Low relative yields in turn drive capital flight – who wants to earn 1.6% on Beijing’s paper when Treasurys are paying 4.5%. This puts intense pressure on the Yuan. In January, the currency fell to its lowest level in decades. To relieve the burden on the Yuan, the Chinese central bank suspended its own bond-buying. This may help the bond market somewhat, but it also removes an important instrument of monetary policy from the Central Bank’s toolkit.
A deflationary trend in prices was a prominent feature of the post-1990 period in Japan. Recent prices in China have followed a similar trajectory.
Inflation:Deflation in China and Japan
Deflation can wreck an economy, driving it into a downward spiral of diminishing demand, rising unemployment, lower business profits and reduced investment. It is both symptom and cause of the woes of Japanification.
The stresses in China’s financial system are beginning to create socio-economic dislocations. One important metric is unemployment — especially youth unemployment. In both Japan and China, Japanification created a surge in the numbers of young people out of work.

Youth Unemployment Rate, China vs Japan
In China, especially, the rate of youth unemployment has exploded. The government responded by suppressing the data for a period of time. The metric was eventually reintroduced with an adjusted calculation that produced a lower figure.
Data scrubbing has not reversed the trend. Even the revised figures (charted above) are still going up.
Youth unemployment in China is considered to have serious social and political implications, beyond merely the challenges of individual joblessness. It is associated with delays in marriage and starting a family, which are important in Chinese culture. This exacerbates the country’s alarming decline in fertility, with significant economic impacts on the social safety net and the fiscal calculus. It projects a demographic crisis in the decades ahead with fewer young workers to support a growing population of retirees. It impacts national productivity, and weakens overall economic growth. It undermines the social contract underlying the educational system, as unemployment seems to be acute among the more highly educated segments of the the young population. Stubborn joblessness is now becoming associated with forms of personal and collective resignation – the “lying flat” phenomenon (躺平) among young people opting out of the traditional work ethic, which has the authorities very concerned.
Reversing this trend may take a long time. In the Japanese case, unemployment did not begin to decline until 14 years after the onset of the crisis. If the same pattern holds in China, it may mean that a new “lost generation” is being created.
These trends show China tracking the Japanese experience quite closely. The only significant departure from the “classical” Japanification pattern is the sharp devaluation of the Chinese currency since 2021. It is a striking and important difference. When the crisis hit Japan, in the 1990s, it caused a powerful strengthening of the Japanese Yen, which nearly doubled in value on the following five years and offset some of the economic pain suffered by Japanese companies and consumers. China’s currency, in contrast, declined to a multi-decade low in January 2025. This anomalous devaluation – described in a previous column – is a sign of potential systemic instability. Japanification 2.0 – or perhaps we will call it Chinafication some day – could turn out to be even more challenging than the original model.

44,2025-02-15,"WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 23: (L-R) Members of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors Christopher Waller, ... [+] Miki Bowman, Chair Jerome Powell, Vice Chair Lael Brainard, Philip Jefferson and Lisa Cook pose for a group photo at the William McChesney Martin Jr. Building of the Federal Reserve May 23, 2022 in Washington, DC. Powell has served as Federal Reserve Board of Governors Chair since February of 2018. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)
In a speech delivered just weeks after January's FOMC meeting, Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller outlined his vision for the maturing stablecoin market, highlighting its growing importance in retail and cross-border payments. The timing and content of the speech signal a potential shift in how traditional financial institutions view these digital assets, particularly in the foreign exchange market.
According to Lux Thiagarajah, a former JP Morgan FX trader now at banking-as-a-service provider OpenPayd, stablecoins are poised to revolutionize the $7.5 trillion daily foreign exchange market. Speaking at the Digital Assets Forum in London earlier this month, Thiagarajah highlighted a crucial advantage: stablecoins can overcome the traditional 2-2.5 day settlement times that have long plagued FX markets.
""This is a massive operational win,"" Thiagarajah explained. ""The ability to settle FX trades instantly rather than waiting for multiple days could transform how institutional investors manage their currency exposure and liquidity.""
In his February 12th speech at ""A Very Stable Conference"" in San Francisco, Fed Governor Waller acknowledged the growing importance of stablecoins, particularly in cross-border payments. He specifically highlighted the emerging ""stablecoin sandwich"" model, where fiat currency in one country is converted to a U.S. dollar stablecoin, transferred, and then converted back to local currency at its destination.
""This has the potential to reduce the complexity of a series of correspondent banking networks, improving transparency, cost, and timeliness,"" Waller noted, while emphasizing the importance of implementing proper anti-money laundering and consumer safeguards.
The parallels between stablecoins and the emergence of Eurodollars in the 1950s and 60s are becoming increasingly apparent. Just as Eurodollars arose from a need to hold and transfer dollars outside the U.S. banking system, stablecoins are emerging as a digital solution to similar challenges in today's global financial system.
A recent analysis shows that stablecoins have already reached a market capitalization of over $200+ billion, with approximately 99% denominated in U.S. dollars. This dominance mirrors the dollar's role in traditional forex markets, where it's involved in roughly 88% of all trades.
Major financial institutions are taking notice. While traditional banks initially dismissed stablecoins as a crypto curiosity, the potential for disruption in FX markets has sparked serious consideration. The ability to settle trades instantly could reduce counterparty risk and free up capital currently tied up in settlement periods.
""The efficiency gains are undeniable,"" says Thiagarajah. “When you can settle an FX trade instantly instead of waiting for days, it fundamentally changes the game for risk management and liquidity optimization.”
Waller’s speech also addressed the need for clear regulatory frameworks, particularly in the United States. ""The stablecoin market would benefit from a U.S. regulatory and supervisory framework that addresses stablecoin risks directly, fully, and narrowly,"" he stated, suggesting that both banks and non-banks should be allowed to issue regulated stablecoins.
As stablecoins continue to mature and gain institutional adoption, their impact on FX markets could be transformative. The combination of instant settlement, reduced counterparty risk, and 24/7 operation presents a compelling case for market participants. The recent statements from both market practitioners like Thiagarajah and regulators like Waller suggest we’re approaching a tipping point. As traditional financial institutions grapple with the implications, the question may no longer be if stablecoins will disrupt FX markets, but when and how dramatically.

45,2025-02-15,"Apple CEO Tim Cook stands next Sofia Leyva at the Fifth Avenue Apple Store (Photo by Alexi ... [+] Rosenfeld/Getty Images)
This week, we should see the launch of the new iPhone SE. As Apple returns to the mid-range market for the first time since 2022, what impact will the smallest and cheapest iPhone have on the rapidly changing smartphone world?
First of all, the iPhone SE needs to change the iPhone. Apple saw its global market share in the smartphone market fall by five percent in the last quarter of 2024. Given this is directly after the launch of the iPhone 16 family, Tim Cook and his team will have been expecting more from the first iPhones designed for Apple Intelligence.
The iPhone SE is a chance for Apple to boost sales across the iPhone range in 2025. It is a mid-range handset with a brand reputation that focuses on matching the power of the leading iPhone line but at a cheaper price. That makes the iPhone SE an attractive starting point for someone joining the ecosystem or looking to bring a relative into Apple’s world. While the iPhone SE may not be as big a seller as the main line, as the first new iPhone in the mid-range since 2022 it can bring a new demographic to the iPhone.
Yet the practical switching costs are high, especially if a user is heavily invested in an app ecosystem or a specific cloud-based service. Android handsets in the expected price range do not have a performance deficit to the main iPhones, let alone the iPhone SE.
If performance is no longer a differentiator, if the price is no longer a deciding factor in the purchase, and the switching costs are too high, Apple will need to change the conversation in the market to move the iPhone SE away from “for the faithful and their friends” to “the first choice of everyone at this price point.""
The iPhone SE is expected to be priced between $479 and $499 for the entry-level model (depending on Apple’s storage choice). Android has the run of the market that sits in this $450-$550 price range, with Google’s launch of the Pixel 6a in the summer of 2022, a few months after the then-current iPhone SE 2022 model, leading the charge.
The competitive nature of the space has seen significant advances in all areas. Many handsets come with flagship-leading chipsets, multi-lens cameras, fast refreshing displays, long battery life, and the latest software advances. Yet every Android manufacturer follows the same path. Where is the disruptor that can stand up and say there is a different way of thinking about this price point?
That would be the iPhone SE.
Putting the numbers in a straight head-to-head with the Android competition, the iPhone SE will lose in each category. Yet Apple has rarely sold any of its hardware purely on price or value for money. It has offered something different, be it in a philosophical approach to design, practical choices over connectivity, and fanatically addressing security concerns.
Android manufacturers cannot ignore Apple's decisions with the iPhone SE hardware. With the tight integration of iOS and the hardware, Apple can offer more stability to end users with an extended support window. The iOS user interface remains stripped back, with almost no options to customise away from Apple’s solitary vision. And Apple’s fanatical and public focus on security can change the conversation in ways no other manufacturer can.
The iPhone SE will get a lot of attention over the next few months because it is the latest iPhone and due to every mid-range Android smartphone needing to be compared to something different… which will be the iPhone SE. The name and capability recognition of the SE is going to be significant.
How the likes of Google, Samsung, Honor, OnePlus and others address these differences will change the market. Whether it consolidates around Android's view or Apple’s view remains to be seen.
AI techniques have been used across the smartphone and mobile computing market for decades. The introduction of generative AI techniques to process large data sets to effect change in the user experience is a fundamental change in what a smartphone can deliver. Since Google launched the Pixel 8 series as the first AI smartphones in 2023, there have been rapid advances in the quality of options available for consumers and the quantity of software choices on offer.
Can Apple step into the market and impose its view on how things should be done?
It is perhaps too late for a wholesale change to happen in the market. Apple is late to this market, only announcing its plans in June 2024 at its Worldwide Developer Conference. The awkwardly backronymed Apple intelligence debuted one month after the launch of the iPhone 16, and the first generation software suite is not expected to be complete until the launch of iOS 18.4 in late March 2024.
The majority of Android manufacturers are rolling out completed second-generation AI software on their latest smartphones. Apple is late to the party with an inferior product. So, how can Apple use both the iPhone SE and Apple Intelligence to impact the direction of generative AI?
Apple’s approach to AI makes a fundamentally different choice to Android, prioritising local processing data. Android has a broader remit driven by the capability of cloud-based servers for more intense calculations and a wider range of apps and services. It will be easier for Apple to change track and expand into the cloud if needed in the future. Still, if the conversation can be driven to focus on personal data not leaving a phone, the Android manufacturers will need to consider making similar choices around local processing.
Apple must also decide if staying with a smaller on-device only approach will leave it behind. Currently, there are areas where Apple has ceded the functionality to OpenAI’s ChatGPT service (and by endorsing ChatGPT, it gives OpenAI a clear victory against other AI providers, solidifying its place in the market).
As generative AI's scope and power increase, smartphones will need to improve their capability to deliver. Yet the iPhone SE—assuming it follows previous models—will likely stay on sale for many years without any hardware upgrades. As AI expands, Apple may find that the most significant impact of the iPhone SE will be on itself. As the specs are superseded, Apple may be forced to move more in-demand AI features into the cloud to allow its mid-range phone to stay relevant.
The iPhone SE is a series of small steps that may not add up to much individually. But small steps can take Apple great distances. Apple will be hoping that it can bring the market closer to Apple’s ideals and, in turn, bring more customers to Apple over the next few years. There is also a danger that pushing to make the iPhone SE relevant over the next few years could drag Apple closer to the current market and weaken its unique offering.
The iPhone SE is going to change the smartphone market. The question is in which direction?
Now read about the three new features that will help the iPhone SE stand out to consumers...

MacBooks all have fairly great displays, especially on the MacBook Pro. However, finding a good display that pairs nicely with a Mac desktop always feels like a little bit of a challenge.
You either have to go with Apple’s expensive options, or compromise significantly on the experience with a third party. Some common compromises include poor brightness, a lack of USB-C, or a lack of macOS integration. While the BenQ MA270U certainly isn’t a Studio Display replacement, it performs excellently in all of the qualities that matter to me.
First things first, this display comes in at $459. That’s cheaper than the Mac mini, even if you’re buying one from the education store. At that price point, it packs an aluminum stand, 400 nits of brightness, USB-C connectivity, and a built in USB hub. It’s a 4K 27″ display, and also offers 2 HDMI ports for plugging in a game console or anything else you might want on your desk.
The built in USB hub is a great perk. The monitor offers two USB-A ports and an additional USB-C port, allowing you to connect up to 3 USB connections to your Mac through one cable. It also provides 90W of power via USB-C, which’ll recharge your MacBook quickly – if you’re using one. The USB-A ports come in clutch as well, since the M4 Mac mini doesn’t include them.
Some will point out that 400 nits of brightness is a little sub-par, which is certainly true compared to Apple’s displays. However, this isn’t a super big deal for indoor usage. Many monitors in this class only have 250-350 nits, so I’m more than happy to have 400 at this price tag.
The aluminum stand is also a nice touch, making the MA270U feel a decent bit premium.
Lastly, there’s Display Pilot 2. This companion app allows you to control the brightness and volume of the display from within macOS. This is a rare feature on non-Apple displays, and normally you have to regularly fidget with physical buttons on the display. You won’t have to do that on the MA270U, and I’m happy to say that. You also don’t need to use the companion app necessarily, keyboard controls also work for brightness and volume control.
Overall, the MA270U a great balance of everything important to me: decent brightness, USB-C connectivity, and a decent price point. At $459, it’s hard to go wrong with this display. There’s also a 32-inch variant available for $599.
If you’re a fellow Mac mini user searching for a nice external display to pair with it, I’d highly recommend this monitor. The aforementioned companion app also has a feature to match its color profile with Apple’s, allowing for a close-to-stock appearance.

48,2025-02-15,"Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) is revolutionizing the web development industry, but is it a threat to web developers? There's been lots of talk online about A.I. taking peoples jobs. I recently watched this great video from Justin Jackson on why he thinks AI won't replace web developers:
In short - I agree. A.I. isn't going to take jobs. Much like No Code or Open Source didn't.
For sure, there will be a certain level of developer that A.I. will take work from, much like the SquareSpaces and Wix of this world took a chunk out of the template based web design market, but SaaS apps? they are more complex in my mind.
I used to be a web developer, and transitioned careers into product design, so know enough about the space to have gone and tried most of the current tools out, and have found them amazing at certain things, but equally average at others (which is no surprise, given they are guessing based on a vast pool of training data, not all of it good).
Building a good product requires thoughtfulness, and decision making, and human intuition, something that Artificial Intelligence just doesn't have.
For example, yes, you can ask an A.I. to make a pricing grid for your website. Will it look good? quite possibly. Will it effectively sell your product? That's another question completely, that needs knowledge of your product, your market, and your customers current needs and wants, and not something an A.I. can give. It guesses, and lacks nuance.
Human intuition translates into designing a good product based on learned experience, and intelligence.
A good well-designed product has rules, a design system, and ways of doing things, that A.I. can't quite (yet) do well. If every time you ask it to do something it's slightly different, that won't work in a good product.
Sure you can get from zero to one with A.I. But can you go from one to three? Can you reliably build a consistent product across a large surface?
If you generate all your code, how do you fix bugs? how do you know what's going on? It's hard to understand if you didn't write it, and potentially could take longer if one needs to customise it. My web developer colleagues all can both debug and fix things fast across the full surface area of a system as they have deep experience and product knowledge.
A lot of hosting companies (like Vercel with V0, and Replit) are making it easy to use A.I. to build products and deploy them, however that comes at a price, and a load of trade offs.
When using an A.I. agent to do things you will always be one step removed, and layers of abstraction always make it hard to do things.
At least a first draft of things. It's always good to use A.I. for inspiration, but do the writing for yourself in your own voice.
They are great for prototyping - most code tools like Replit, Github Copilot and WindsurfAI (my current favourite) have moved to fully Agentic prompting (so you say ""I want to build a product with X features using Y framework and Z CSS library"") and it goes off, writes a plan, and builds something step by step.
However, they build without much context of what you want, what user needs are, and how maintainable things should be going forward. As we know, artificial intelligence isn't actual intelligence, it's just predicting what goes next, based on a corpus of previous knowledge.
It's incredible seeing what an A.I. enabled code editor can suggest, filling in whole functions, and speeding the pace of writing code. I can only see that increasing.
I've built myself a small mobile-optimised editing tool for my eleventy static site. I'm typing in it now. No one else has to use it, just me.
I used Django to scaffold out the site, then used A.I. to try our different CSS frameworks, look at them, poke the code, and discard them very fast. I also used A.I. to write integration scripts for some A.I. APIs to build a chat widget in my editor.
What I love using A.I. for is explaining how things work - it's like a helpful teacher that never gets tired, and can explain why or how a certain framework function works like it does, often with examples from the docs. The key (for me at least) is I understand every line of code that has been generated, and have gone in and tweaked things when they weren't right, or could see obvious errors.
I see A.I. a bit like the mech suit in Aliens. Super powerful, but you need to know what you are doing, and if you don't you make a hard-to-maintain mess.
A.I. is good at building basic CRUD apps. However I wouldn't trust an A.I. with thoughtful user experience, fixing edge cases, reliability, and so forth. Generally it's great for a v1, but you often have to ask it to redo lots of things, and it lacks nuance or experience. It's not intelligent.
Things that don't need a great user experience, but just need to work, often used by a single person.
NoCode solutions might also be in danger, as these often have quite generic basic functionality.
I've got friends who work in the ecommerce space, and have saved days in man hours getting A.I. to write conversion scripts to migrate products into Shopify from other platforms.
Basically anything formulaic that can be churned out. Probably a lot of outsourced work where things are built to a spec, and there's not much care or iteration.
There's no doubt A.I. is changing the face of the web development industry as a whole, but certainly for the short term, I think web developers (or a least the good ones) will be OK.
I think A.I. will certainly help people write code, and even debug problems at an exponential rate. As code tools improve, A.I. will augment, but not take over web developer jobs, enable more efficient working, freeing up time spent on more mundane tasks to things with more problem-solving and strategic thinking.
A.I.'s capabilities are limited in that it requires guidance and understanding from human users to deliver optimal results in product creation and design.
If web developers focus on delivering good quality work thoughtfully that provides genuine value, and learn how to use these new tools to their benefit, they will always be one step ahead.

49,2025-02-15,"As the market for renewables in Texas continues to strengthen and innovate, the power makeup of the state’s electric grid is slated to keep shifting toward adding more renewables. Last year, solar and battery storage installation led capacity growth within Texas’ electric grid, according to research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas published in January. 
Texas added nearly 1,500 megawatts of battery storage to the grid’s summer rated capacities in 2023. That figure almost tripled to 4,374 megawatts added in 2024, according to the report. 
Capacity from solar power added to the grid enjoyed a similar trajectory. In 2023, 4,570 megawatts were added to the grid, while in 2024, nearly 9,700 megawatts were added. 
Given that Texas has its own isolated energy grid, the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) is responsible for managing the majority of energy for its residents. 
Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom.
Historically, ERCOT, which manages 90 percent of the state’s power load, has primarily relied on natural gas. But other energy sources, like wind and solar, have played a critical role in offsetting high demand. 
ERCOT added 3,400 megawatts from natural gas power plants in 2024. That’s after more than 1,000 megawatts of natural gas power were inactive within the grid from 2021 to 2023, according to Dallas Fed data. 
The capacity growth from solar and battery storage allowed the grid to manage another hot Texas summer in 2024, reported Garret Golding, an assistant vice president for energy program at the Dallas Fed. 
Battery storage is relatively new to ERCOT. One of the first battery power storage plants to be connected to ERCOT was in 2021, southeast of Dallas in Kaufman County. 
The 50-megawatt plant run by Enel, one of the largest renewable energy owners and operators in the country, was the first of Enel’s 14 battery projects it has since developed across the state. 
The forecasted power demand in Texas from population growth and heavy load users like data centers, cryptocurrency mining and artificial intelligence, alongside the competitive market for batteries, is dictating the rising use of storage within ERCOT, said Randald Bartlett, a senior director of operations and management for battery energy storage systems at Enel North America.
Texas’ permitting processes and ability to develop has made it easier to add and build new capacity in comparison to other states with more laborious entryways, Bartlett said. 
Before, there wasn’t really adequate criteria and evidence to forecast what batteries would contribute to the grid, ERCOT CEO Pablo Vegas said during a board of directors meeting on Tuesday. 
Now, the grid operator added battery contribution to its report forecasting future capacity, demand and reserves. 
Battery storage in the ERCOT grid has nearly doubled every year since 2021, Vegas said. At the end of 2024, there were nearly 10,000 megawatts from batteries within ERCOT.
Vegas said the capacity from batteries made a significant difference in ERCOT during bridge hours, or the winter morning hours when the sun has yet to rise and in the evenings after the sun sets. 
“Batteries made a meaningful contribution to what those shoulder periods look like and how much scarcity we get into during these peak events,” Vegas said when analyzing the grid’s performance during recent winter storms. 
In the spring of 2024, Texas’ installation of utility scale solar outpaced California’s, and jumped from 1,900 megawatts in 2019 to over 20,000 megawatts in 2024. As a result, solar met nearly 50 percent of the state’s peak power demand on some days. 
The state’s quick deployment of utility scale solar didn’t happen overnight. It started in 2005, when the legislature instructed the Public Utility Commission of Texas to create competitive renewable energy zones, where the state planned transmission lines to connect cities to renewable energy sources in west Texas.
Initially, it was intended to capture wind power but was able to quickly include solar because of the existing infrastructure, said Dustin Mulvaney, an environmental studies professor at San Jose State University and an author of Planning to Build Faster: A Solar Energy Case Study, published in October by the Roosevelt Institute. 
That forward-looking plan is often held up as a model renewable energy advocates and developers say the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission could implement across other regional transmission organizations, by requiring proactive planning and by creating rules of how to pay for transmission systems. 
As the state’s grid continues to experience a rapid shift in the type of generation available to serve demand, the state’s grid operator is looking to build a higher voltage transmission system, upgrading from 345-kilovolt lines to 765-kilovolt lines. 
In 2024, nearly 78 gigawatts of transmission-connected wind, solar and battery energy storage capacity was installed to the grid. And more than 102 gigawatts of transmission-connected renewable capacity is expected to be installed by the end of 2025, according to a December ERCOT report.
It’s that growth of both demand and renewables connected to the grid that’s led ERCOT to ask the Public Utility Commission to consider upgrading the state’s transmission system rather than expanding its existing one. 
The 765-kV lines would provide significant economic and reliability benefits to the ERCOT system, wrote Kristi Hobbs, ERCOT’s vice president of system planning and weatherization, in the grid operator’s submission of its regional transmission plans to the commission in late January.
Regardless of which transmission plan is chosen, Hobbs wrote, the explosive growth projected throughout the next six years and beyond will require major public investment.

All the way back in 2021, Spotify confirmed that a new tier of its music streaming service with high fidelity audio output was in development. Four years laters, that aural nirvana is still nowhere to be seen. That might finally change this year.
According to Bloomberg, Spotify will roll out a new “super fan” subscription add-on that will bring higher quality audio streaming to its platform. Other benefits include access to remixing tools for mixing songs using AI and the ability to buy concert tickets.
Now, before you get your hopes up, here’s the standard dose of caution. This is not the first time we’re hearing about the imminent launch of Spotify HiFi, as similar speculations emerged in 2024, as well.
So, when exactly is the service launching? We only have a “later this year” timeline, according to Bloomberg, but it seems the company will be hawking its new product under the Spotify Pro label. Pricing and release timeline haven’t been set in stone as Spotify is still hashing out the licensing details with music labels.
As per the report, Spotify is currently mulling a $6 add-on for the different bundles it offers in the US market. The pricing will likely vary for other markets, especially developing countries, where the subscriptions cost lower.
In the span that Spotify has continued to develop its hi-res music streaming system, the likes of Amazon, Apple, and Tidal have continued to strengthen their presence in the audiophile community with their respective high fidelity music streaming products.
At the moment, Spotify’s peak audio bit rate goes only up to 320kbps. When the company revealed plans for Spotify HiFi, it promised ”CD-quality, lossless audio” without going into the technical details. This is what Spotify currently has to offer:
To put that into perspective, the “Low” tier of Tidal offers up to 320 kbps range. As you go higher to the “Max” level where the HiRes FLAC codec comes into the picture, the figures climb up to 24-bit, 192 kHz range.
Apple Music, for comparison, offers a range of 16-bit/44.1 kHz (which the company refers to as CD Quality) to 24-bit/192 kHz with its “lossless” upgrade. Notably, Apple doesn’t charge extra cash for its high-quality streaming perk.
Amazon Music’s Unlimited tier delivers a sample rate of 44.1 kHz with a peak bitrate of 850 kbps. Tracks labeled as Ultra-HD reach a 24-bit depth (44.1 kHz up to 192 kHz) at an average bitrate of 3,730 kbps.
Other benefits of the $6 Spotify Pro add-on might include priority access to ticket sales and beat seat choices for concerts. Spotify already offers a curated live events feed that lets you find concerts happening nearby.
Spotify plans currently start at $5.99 per month (for students) in the US, $11.99 for individuals, and go all the way up to $19.99 for the family plan. Convincing music enthusiasts to spend nearly 50% higher tariff for accessing hi-res music, especially in the face of lower-priced competition, won’t be a cakewalk for the company.
During its live Spotify Stream On event today, the streaming music company announced that it will launch Spotify HiFi, a new option for its premium subscribers that will give them access to lossless, high-quality music streams, later this year.
Spotify describes the audio as ""lossless CD-quality,"" which is a considerable step up from the company's current 320kbps, lossy streaming quality. It said that high-quality music streaming is consistently one of the most requested new features by its users.
With President’s Day only a week away, we’re going to start seeing some major discounts on TVs, soundbars, streaming devices, and plenty of other home theater tech. In fact, some of these sales have already started. Take this Amazon 4K LED, for example: Right now, when you purchase the Amazon 65-inch Omni Series 4K LED, you’ll only wind up paying $360. The full MSRP on this model is $550.
There’s nothing like a handful of great TV deals to start the work week, so take advantage of this offer (and ones like it) while you still can!
We’re only a week away from President’s Day, and the TV deals have already started rolling in! Top brands like Samsung, Sony, and LG are offering markdowns on some of their best models, but one of the best offers we’ve seen today is also one of the best 75-inch TV deals we’ve come across in a minute:
For a limited time, when you order the Samsung 75-inch QE1D 4K QLED through the manufacturer, you’ll only wind up paying $980. The full MSRP on this model is $1,800.

The Core Ultra 5 230F offers 10 cores (6P + 4E) and 10 cores based on the Arrow Lake architecture with Lion Cove performance and Skymont efficient cores. The max turbo frequency on the P-cores sees a nice 100 MHz bump versus the Core i5-14490F at 5 GHz, while the efficient cores can boost 700 MHz higher than last-gen. The Core Ultra 5 230F seemingly uses A0 silicon (the 6P + 8E die), which is different from other budget models based on the B0 stepping (the 8P + 16E die).
Nonetheless, Intel has packaged this CPU with 22MB of L2 cache and 24MB of L3 cache (46MB total), a 37% improvement over the 14490F with 33.5MB total cache. The reviewer says that the Core Ultra 5 230F is retailing in China for around 2,000 Yuan ($275), just $25 shy of the 245K and much more expensive than the i5-14600K, which readily goes for 1,499 Yuan ($200). This combination of a price increase, so-so performance gains, and high platform entry costs will likely deter many potential customers.
The test bench features the MSI MAG B860M Mortar WiFi for the LGA 1851 platform and the Asus ROG Strix B760-G Gaming WiFi for the LGA1700 platform. Both systems use the RTX 4090 Founders Edition and 32GB of DDR5-6000 CL36 memory from Corsair. The benchmarks contain two Core Ultra 5 230F test runs and Core i5-14490F, one at stock settings and the other with elevated power limits.
In benchmarks like Y-Cruncher, 7-Zip, and 3DMark, encoding, Blender, V-Ray, and Cinebench, the Core Ultra 5 230F easily leads its predecessor by 7.9% in single-threaded performance and 20.9% in multi-threaded workloads, at stock. Interestingly, with unlocked power limits, the Core Ultra 5 230F improves by just 3.2% versus default settings, which isn't that impressive. When stressed in AIDA64, the Core Ultra 5 230F (4.3 GHz) draws 73.6W at stock, while Core i5-14490F (3.4 GHz) sips 81.2W of power. Increasing the power budget means the 230F (4.8 GHz) consumes 108.5W, and the 14490F (4.4 GHz) uses 139.4W of power.
In games, the Core Ultra 5 230F is neck and neck against the unlocked Core Ultra 5 245K. This isn't as impressive as you'd think since the bar is set relatively low, occasionally losing to the Core i5-14490F. AMD's Ryzen 7000 non-X processors can be tuned to match their X-equivalents through PBO. The same cannot be said for budget Arrow Lake, which might be a dealbreaker for many, especially considering that LGA1851 is rumored to support only one CPU generation.

Senior International Film Correspondent

	A raft of Hollywood stars and industry professionals have vowed to re-locate outside of the U.S. in response to Donald Trump’s second presidency, but L.A-based Plan B co-founder Dede Gardner will not be among their ranks. 

	Talking in a masterclass at the Berlin Film Festival’s European Film Market on Saturday, the producer hinted that the idea had crossed her mind during Trump’s first month, which has seen extreme policy shifts around immigration, trade tariffs, DEI programs and foreign aid.

	“The truth of it is that there are days, especially recently, where you think this isn’t sustainable. What’s going to happen? This seems completely nuts,” said Gardner.

	“And then there are days where I think, particularly being in California, which is essentially the most progressive place in the world. Part of me thinks, ‘You know what. Stay here, be on the frontline, be around here, be near the change’,” she continued.  




			Watch on Deadline		






	Gardner said she was taking inspiration from late political activist writer Mike Davis, author City Of Quartz and Set The Night On Fire: L.A. In The Sixties.

	“We interviewed the great Mike Davis several years ago for a movie about the L.A. riots. He was one of the preeminent thinkers about Los Angeles,” she revealed. 

	“He said, everything that happens in L.A. happens 20 years before it happens in the United States. So there’s also a part of me that says you can’t run you have to actually stay here and be rigorous and keep pushing for story and story that counter-acts the erasure of history.”

	Gardner is at the Berlinale as a producer on Bong Joon-ho’s sci-fi drama Mickey 17, which gets a gala splash this evening with its Oscar-winning Korean director and the film’s star Robert Pattinson hitting the red carpet, as well as the low-budget drama Olmo which plays in Panorama.

	“We made Okja with him and is genuinely a great master of filmmaking and also a tremendous human, which factors in because it’s years of your life and you want to be around people you love, if you can,” she said of Plan B’s second collaboration with Joon-ho.

	“We were talking to Warner Bros and they had this novel by Edward Ashton’s novel [Mickey 7]. We said, ‘We’re interested in doing it, but truly you have to get one of the very best, there is no middle version of this text… let’s shoot for the moon… we had an instinct, knowing director Bong as we do, that he would respond to the themes of the book. He changed it a lot but the underbelly, the main heel is there.”

	










	Having been originally scheduled for a March, 2024 release, the movie is set to release in South Korea on February 28 , followed by the U.S. on March 7, after premieres in London and now Berlin.

	Gardner said there were a number of factors behind the delay.

	“Truthfully, the tail of Covid, then the tail of the strikes, the change of regime [at Warner Bros.] and then there was an opportunity to put it in early March which is great date given the four week-run in the United States of various spring breaks. The hope is that that will create a long runway,” she said.

	The company’s second Berlinale title Olmo, is a low budget movie by Fernando Eimbcke and Vanesa Garnica. The New Mexico-set drama follows a 14-year-old boy who is the main carer for his sick father and longs to go to party

	Plan B produced the film with Teorema, the production company of Michel Franco, who is also at the Berlinale with Golden Bear contender Dreams.

	Gardner revealed that a new financing facility provided by Plan B’s majority stake-holding partner, the Paris-based pan-European content company Mediawan, had helped finance the film.

	“We have facility to finance I guess we can call them microbudget films – in the spirit of Moonlight, Minari and The Last Black Man In San Francisco – and that is what Olmo is. It’s the first movie we’ve fully financed for a very small number,” she said.

	She said Plan B had been tracking director Eimbcke since his 2004 film Duck Season.

	“We just fell madly in love with it and then he made a couple of other movies and then he kind of receded but we kept in touch… and then he came to us and had written this incredibly personal story… and we thought let’s make this our maiden voyage under this new facility,” he said.

	Giving an update on upcoming films on the Plan B slate, Gardner shot down speculation that Joseph Kosinski’s upcoming motor-racing action drama F1 with Brad Pitt might be ready in time for a Cannes splash.

	“It won’t be ready… There are like a billion visual hotshots,” she said, adding details of how the production had embedded with the Formula 1 races for the shoot.

	“There were cameras all over the cars but also, we had a garage on pit lane. There were all the garages, and then the movie garage. They were on the grid walk… the sport was so welcoming. It was this incredible integration of the movie people and the people racing. We did it together.”

61,2025-02-15,"Chargeasap is launching a Kickstarter campaign for a brand new kind of powerbank. Flash Pro Ultra is the world’s first 275W portable battery that uses an OLED screen for displaying charging status. It supports charging up to six devices simultaneously including a power-hungry MacBook Pro, and it uses the latest Qi2 wireless charging for the MagSafe experience. Read on to learn how you can be one of the first to get your hands on Flash Pro Ultra.
Check out our hands-on video to get a better look at the Chargeasap Flash Pro Ultra in action:
Chargeasap has designed Flash Pro Ultra to be one portable power source capable of charging devices as low power as the Apple Watch all the way up to the most powerful MacBook Pros.
Simultaneous charging, for example, can deliver power to two MacBooks, iPad, iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch- all in one TSA-friendly portable powerbank.
Flash Pro Ultra doesn’t just charge a ton of devices. It does it super fast. It can charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro to 50% in just half an hour. And the powerbank itself is no slouch either. It can juice up from 0 to 80 percent in just 35 minutes, or charge from empty to full in 70 minutes, using 140W power input.
Thanks to its packed 25,000mAh capacity battery, you can use Flash Pro Ultra to recharge a MacBook Air 1.5 times or an iPhone 16 Pro Max up to four times on a single charge. You can also power up two 16-inch MacBook Pros at the same time — this was unheard of just a few years ago.
Best of all, Flash Pro Ultra can act as the ultimate charging hub. That’s because it supports pass-through charging, allowing you to charge the powerbank as well as five other devices simultaneously. All that power for a powerbank that weighs less than a pound and a half.
When it comes to charging, every Flash Pro Ultra comes with a choice of smartwatch charging pucks for either Samsung or Apple Watch. These support 5W power output.
Next, you’ve got a magnetic wireless charging surface like MagSafe that supports 15W power output using Qi2 Fast Charge. This is perfect for quickly powering up your iPhone or AirPods wirelessly.
There’s a single USB-A port that delivers 60W power output, and a single USB-C Power Delivery 3.0 port with another 60W power output.
For devices that can draw even more power, there’s a 100W USB-C Power Delivery 3.0 port with 100W power output.
And for the most power-craving devices, a USB-C1 Power Delivery 3.1 port provides up to 140W power output. All that adds up to up to 275W power output from a single powerbank, making it the most powerful powerbank ever.
Equally impressive is the dual OLED display integrated with Flash Pro Ultra. The days of OLED being reserved for only the most high-end devices are over. 
The OLED dual display allows you to see charging data in real time, including the powerbank’s battery percentage, time remaining, and even charging data like volts and amps.
All this comes in a portable package that starts at $169, making the ultimate powerbank a must-have in your toolkit. Chargeasap is launching a 60-day Kickstarter campaign to help bring the product to market. Choose between an Apple Watch or Samsung Watch charging pad, while a limited-edition colour, space grey, in addition to the black version, will be available if the campaign hits the $350K stretch goal.
The Flash Pro Ultra campaign kicks off today and runs through April 12. Shipping is slated for August.
You can keep up with the latest from Chargeasap on Facebook and X.

As one of the first new Motorola phones of 2025, I was pretty excited to get my hands on the Moto G Power 2025. At $299, it's by no means a flagship phone, so I knew very well what I was getting myself into. But while I have plenty of experience with flagships, like the Galaxy S25 Plus I just reviewed, I always enjoy seeing how phones on the lower end improve.
The Moto G Power 2025 is a middle-of-the-road phone for Motorola that leans toward the low-end. That's something to keep in mind when looking at a phone priced just under $300. There's nothing particularly groundbreaking about it, but it does come with a few surprises that we wouldn't have expected to see on such an affordable phone.

Motorola launched the Moto G Power 2025 on January 14, and the phone went on sale on February 6. It can be purchased unlocked directly from Motorola.com or retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy. The phone will also be sold through carriers, including T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, Cricket, AT&T, Straight Talk, Total Wireless, Verizon, UScellular, and Consumer Cellular.
The Moto G Power 2025 will be available starting at $299, although pricing may vary depending on the retailer or carrier.
The phone will only come in two colorways: Leaf Green and Slate Gray. Availability of these colors may also depend on the retailer or carrier.

For years, Motorola's phones have had very basic designs, especially the budget Moto G series. The company has been switching that up in recent years, borrowing design cues from its higher-end Edge series like a seamless camera housing and vegan leather finishes. The Moto G Power 2025 is possibly the best-looking Moto G phone I've reviewed, in many ways looking more like a flagship than a $300 phone.
The phone only comes in two colors but the standout is the Leaf Green (not to be confused with the 2004 Pokémon game of the same name). It's incredibly vibrant, and the soft vegan leather is contrasted by the glossy camera rings, which add a nice flair. The frame of the phone also matches the color and sports a brushed finish. Fingerprints are pretty much non-existent on this phone.

But it's not just good looks that make this phone stand out; it's the build quality. The Moto G Power 2025 is one of the cheapest phones to sport an IP68/IP69 water and dust resistance rating. It may not seem like a huge deal, but this will ensure that the phone can not only handle being submerged but can also withstand high-pressure jets of water. Has anyone ever had their phone accidentally fall into a dishwasher right before they started a cycle? No? Just me? Well, now, that's one less thing you have to worry about.
I'm not brave enough to test this out myself, but Android Central Phones editor Nick Sutrich did just that with the OnePlus 13, and it came out unscathed. I'll take his word for it.
The MIL-STD-810H certification is also a plus, especially since I've recently taken up skiing and tend to keep my phone in my pocket despite still being quite a novice on the slopes.

Motorola sticks with a Full HD+ LCD panel for the Moto G Power 2025, which is plenty bright and responsive thanks to the 120Hz refresh rate. Despite not being the brightest at 1000 nits, I haven't had any trouble viewing the display in any lighting conditions. The bezels are also pretty minimal despite the larger chin and slightly larger forehead.
The high refresh rate helps make Android 15 feel very smooth when scrolling through apps and pages. There aren't any significant changes with Motorola's version of Android 15 since shifting its software to the new Hello UX with Android 14. It's a fairly clean and simple flavor of Android that doesn't feature too many extra flourishes, although it's dotted here and there with some of Motorola's fixins, like the new dual-panel Control Center/notification pane that more Android phones are adopting.
Motorola also retains its useful gestures, which continue to be a favorite of mine. Chopping the phone twice turns on the flashlight, twisting twice enables the camera, and a double tap on the back can open apps or perform certain actions. I also love the Sidebar, which can be used to house your frequently used apps, and I think every OEM should have something like this (looking at you, Google).

Performance isn't as big of an issue as one might think. I haven't noticed many problems in this area, but it's important to manage your expectations to some extent. For instance, I can't get away with playing Honkai: Star Rail on its highest settings unless I wanna struggle through poor frame rates and barely functional gameplay. But the phone can surprisingly manage the game at visual settings set to ""High"" and at 60fps, which is honestly still a great way to play the game.

You'll also be happy to know that battery life is quite good. While I would like to see a 6,000mAh battery on the phone with ""Power"" in the name, the 5,000mAh capacity still gets the phone through a full day of regular use without issue. It's helped by 30W wired charging, which is still faster than the likes of the Galaxy S25, and 15W wireless charging is a nice thing to have, even if it's not Qi2.
Motorola is also doing a better job with its software promise. Previously, the company would offer one OS upgrade with three years of software updates. In 2025, the company is upping that for its budget phones with one additional OS upgrade, meaning the Moto G Power 2025 will support Android 17 when it launches, giving this $300 even more value.

While I mostly enjoy Motorola's flavor of Android, the downside of buying a cheap Android phone like this is that you're likely to find some level of bloatware. There are quite a few apps preinstalled that I don't want and wasn't given an option to opt out of. They're easy to uninstall, but that's just another step in the setup process that no one wants to deal with.
The silver lining is that the annoying Glance lock screen is disabled by default, although it still lingers in the lock screen settings. However, a new annoyance has seemingly replaced it in the way of the Weather app, powered by 1Weather. It's a pretty busy app filled with ads and the constant ping of weather warnings that I largely don't care about or need. This one you can't uninstall, but you can disable it or turn off the notifications because, honestly, your best bet is to stick with Google's At a Glance widget.
And while you'll find quite a bit of bloatware, one thing you won't really find is AI. The Moto G Power 2025 is a pretty barebones, straightforward phone with none of the flair you'll find on more expensive models. Likely due to limitations with the chipset, you don't get things like Circle to Search, Magic Canvas, or any of the other cool Moto AI features. You do get Magic Editor and Magic Compose, although don't expect any on-device AI processing.

The Moto G Power 2025 features a triple dual camera system with a 50MP primary sensor and an 8MP ultrawide that doubles as a macro sensor. The cameras are... usable. In good lighting, you can get a decent image, the shutter speed is pretty quick, and I don't hate the selfies taken with the 16MP front-facing camera. However, images are often noisy and lack detail. Lowlight images don't fare very well either.
One saving grace is the built-in Auto Enhance feature that you can switch on with a tap. It utilizes Google Photos to automatically improve images right after they're taken, adjusting colors, lighting, and more. Improvements can be subtle, but they help to make the camera more usable.
Oh, and there's a third rear sensor, but it's just an ambient light sensor and it doesn't seem to actually be much help here.
On the other hand, one feature you'll want to turn off when you set up the Moto G Power 2025 is the RAM Boost. I'm already not a fan of virtual RAM solutions, and it's turned on by default on the Power, upping its 8GB to 12GB. While it feels like it should help, the phone felt quite sluggish in my initial use, especially when gaming. It wasn't until I turned off the RAM Boost that performance improved.

There are a fair amount of options for anyone looking for a $300 phone. The Moto G Power 2025 competes with the likes of the CMF Phone 1, which comes from Nothing's budget brand. It comes with a unique design with changeable backplates, a pretty good camera, and an AMOLED display, which isn't very common at this price point. That said, there's no NFC, and if you're in the U.S., network support is fairly spotty.
The Galaxy A25 is also an option. Even though it's last year's model, the A25 comes with an OLED display, a 50MP triple camera system, and an impressive update promise with four OS upgrades and five years of software updates. However, if you're PWM sensitive, you may not find the display very pleasing to use. It also has a dated design with a waterdrop notch, and the Exynos chip can be quite sluggish.
Finally, there's the Redmi Note 13 Pro. This is also a 2024 model featuring an impressive 200MP camera, a sleek design, and great battery life. However, it's held back by hardware limitations, you'll find plenty of bloatware, and you may not wanna hold out for timely updates.

You should buy this if...
You shouldn't buy this if...
In 2025, AI is the name of the game, but you won't really find that here. For $300, the Moto G Power 2025 is a solid budget phone that can get you through the day without weighing down the experience with a ton of superfluous features. It's for someone who just wants a phone that can do the basics, maybe play some games, and not much else. And honestly, that's great.
Maybe the camera could be better. Maybe the bloatware can be a little annoying. But these are the concessions you'll have to deal with at this price point, and frankly, the Moto G Power 2025 could be a lot worse. Instead, Motorola seems to be making the best out of what it could get with the Power, improving its software support, giving it flagship-level durability, and making it look better than any other $300 phone on the market.
Like the Moto G 2025, this phone surprised me, not because of how good it is, but because of how much worse it could be. It's not perfect, but you have to take it for what it is, and that's a pretty good cheap phone.

The Moto G Power 2025 is a pretty middle-of-the-road budget phone that gets all the basics right while not getting too caught up in the AI game. It has a durable design, vegan leather finish, and great all-day battery life.

63,2025-02-15,"Tayme Thapthimthong is taking it all in. Relaxing with other The White Lotus cast members in the upper rafters of Phuket’s Bangla Muay Thai Stadium, the 35-year-old former nightclub bouncer, soldier, and talent show contestant can hardly believe his luck.
Below him, two fighters are trading flying kicks in the ring as series creator Mike White discusses camera angles with his cabal of producers. To his left, two-time Emmy nominee Carrie Coon is fanning herself against the oppressive heat. To his right, Lalisa “Lisa” Manobal, star of K-pop supergroup Blackpink, chats with an aide.
Just a few weeks earlier Tayme was working as a bodyguard for a Thai rapper. Now he’s starring in one of television’s biggest shows—and as Lisa’s love interest, no less. Season 3 of Lotus takes HBO’s hit black comedy to Thailand and Tayme plays security guard Gaitok at the luxury resort. You could forgive Tayme for feeling a bit of imposter syndrome. But he’s choosing just to relish every second.
“It's incredible,” he told TIME last April during one of two exclusive visits to the set of The White Lotus. “When I think back to what I was doing a year ago compared to now, I feel very blessed and I appreciate everything so much.”
Gaitok is a sweet guy with a crush on pretty coworker Mook—played by Lisa—and the burning desire to prove himself as more than just a rent-a-cop for pampered vacationers. And in person, Tayme betrays much of that same tender, soft-spoken charm as his Lotus alter ego. But a big difference in his transformation from real-life to on-screen security personnel is that the true Tayme has zero need to prove his valor to anyone.
Tayme was born and raised in London, where his Bangkok native parents ran a successful restaurant in the well-heeled Kensington district. But despite the family’s success, growing up as a third culture kid wasn’t always easy. “I did experience some bullying,” he says. “I stood out a little bit being the only Asian kid in school.”
Turns out that torment was a formative experience. “I always think back to a moment when I decided to stand up to the bullies,” he says. “It just changed everything. It made me feel maybe sometimes you just have to fight back.”

Fighting soon became a way of life for Tayme, who at the age of 13 enrolled in Combined Cadet Force, a British Armed Forces-run training program for kids in schools. “It was almost like a calling,” he says. “Because I was never good academically, but I was good at sports.”
After high school, Tayme desperately wanted to join the Royal Marines. “Afghanistan was already kicking off and I just felt the calling to go,” he says. But his father insisted that he get a degree first, so he enrolled in a dance course at West London’s Kingston University. “Not that I was a dancer!” he laughs. “I didn't know what else to do. So I thought I'd choose something with the least writing. I was very wrong; it's a lot of writing!”
Between studies, Tayme worked in a nightclub as a bouncer. “No one was scared of me, for sure!” he says. “I still had a baby face but back then, when I was 19, doing bouncing work, it was pretty hard.” 
To prepare for the Marines, Tayme started training with a family friend who had served with Britain’s elite Special Air Service, or SAS, to build up his fitness and stamina. He passed the aptitude test, aced the fitness, but there was a problem. “I failed the physical because they found my left ear just doesn't hear very well,” he says. “I got off a plane when I was 11 and it just never popped.”
That rejection stung. “I was just gutted after training so much for this thing that I wanted most in the world,” he says. “And it kind of broke me. I didn't really know what to do with myself.”
His dad suggested he live with his aunt and uncle in Thailand for a change of scenery, using the language skills his parents had forced him to practice growing up. He arrived in Bangkok with a vague notion to find his way into entertainment. “I also loved to act and sing but I just never really took it that seriously.”
However, he quickly learned that without any experience, the cutthroat Thai showbiz industry was going to be a struggle. Then a connected friend suggested he try out for a reality talent show called Academy Fantasia, which was like X-Factor crossed with Big Brother, with 24 budding performers living in a house as they prepare for weekly singing, drama, and dancing contests. Tayme came in second and wound up with a record deal. 
However, the sheen soon rubbed off. “I like to sing blues and R&B but they didn’t have a market for that here,” he says. “So they were trying to make me more rock. It wasn't really me.”
Still, by now Tayme had the profile to segue into acting, landing a few minor parts in international films that came to Thailand, such as Skin Trade, Farang, and the Netflix series Thai Cave Rescue. Despite acting alongside heroes like martial arts legend Tony Jha, major roles proved elusive, leaving Tayme to generally portray “corrupt policemen or drug dealers,” he says. “Fourteen days of filming was the most I'd ever had.”
That's why after five years of singing and acting he started to reevaluate his career choices. “I didn’t know where this was going and wanted a stable income,” he says. “That’s when I decided to join the Thai Army.”
Read More: How Thailand Is Redefining ‘Soft Power’
Despite being by far the oldest recruit undergoing the six months of basic training, he sufficiently impressed his instructors to be posted to the elite Counter Terrorist Operations Command, which is equivalent to the U.S. Delta Force. After three years, he was made an officer in the Close Projection division of Thailand’s Armed Forces Security Centre, its CIA equivalent, which is charged with guarding high-ranking officials. Tayme ended up serving as a shooting instructor. “I was initially trained as an agent just using handguns and stuff,” he says. “But then later I decided to do counter assault, which is the SWAT team attached to security details.”
Another three years later Tayme decided to leave the army for more lucrative security contracting work. A chance meeting with the Thai rapper Way of the hip-hop group Thaitanium led to him becoming his personal bodyguard. And it was while doing security that the opportunity to audition for Lotus popped up. “I've always seen myself as an action guy because I have weapons skills,” he says. “But now with The White Lotus I’m willing to give anything a go. I love it.”
Not least since he gets to work so closely with Lisa, which has made him extra popular at home. “My daughter loves Blackpink,” he says. “I myself haven't really listened to K-pop but when I come home my daughter would have Blackpink concerts on the TV.”
Tayme credits Lisa for helping him perfect his Thai accent for Lotus. “Because my character is an island kid, who grew up on Samui, I had to make my Thai much better and my English much worse,” he says.
Tayme now has an American agent and hasn’t ruled out moving to Hollywood if that would help his career. He’s already secured parts in the new Alien: Earth series coming out later this year as well as the upcoming Jason Statham movie Mutiny. “Security has always been my safety net,” he says. “But this time, I'm really going to go for the acting. Because this opportunity is probably not going to come around again. And this is amazing.”

Xiaomi Android

The Xiaomi 15 Ultra has been starring in a lot of rumors, leaks, and even official teasers lately, ahead of its initial unveiling in China which could be taking place on February 26. While we still don't know exactly when the device will become official in Xiaomi's home market, the company has now unveiled the date when it's going to be launched in global markets: March 2.
That's the day before MWC starts in Barcelona, Spain, so we assume Xiaomi's launch event will also be taking place over there, as it's customary for phone makers to hold launch events the weekend before MWC actually starts (which is always on a Monday, and this year it's March 3).
Get ready to witness #TheNextPinnacle with us on March 2nd for the #Xiaomi15Series and more. #XiaomiLaunch 🟠📷🔴 Loading... pic.twitter.com/A5OHwuYdm1
If history from 2024 repeats itself, then expect the 'vanilla' Xiaomi 15 to also make its global debut alongside the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, while the Pro stays relegated to the Chinese market.
The Xiaomi 15 Ultra has already been seen in leaked renders and leaked hands-on images. According to recent rumors, its camera chops will be unrivaled, at least in terms of hardware, since it's allegedly going to sport a 50 MP main snapper with a 1-inch type sensor, a 50 MP ultrawide, a 50 MP short-range telephoto, and a 200 MP long-range periscope telephoto using the same sensor as the vivo X100 Ultra and X200 Pro.
To get an idea of what to expect from its cameras, take a look at a sample shot - or even a full video shot on the Xiaomi 15 Ultra. The phone will be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, and is rumored to have a 6,000 mAh battery with support for 90W wired and 50W wireless charging. It will run Android 15 with Xiaomi's HyperOS 2.0 on top from day one. Pricing should be in line with the Xiaomi 14 Ultra.
Um, glass? I expect nothing but glass from a 1500€ phones...
Apparently Samsung has noticed this too, which is why the S25U comes with superglue-mounted rings to make their cameras look ""better"". 

In my opinion a big camera bump means, a camera beast!!!!!!! 
Small camera bump looks, like it has weak cameras. 
Like on Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. 
🤢🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮 
 
Yep, I have Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and Vivo X100 Ultra and yes, the big camera bump ...

Most Americans aren’t sold on driverless cars or robotaxis, but they’re coming anyways; Tesla (TSLA), Uber (UBER), and Lyft (LYFT) are betting on it.
The last big driverless-car hype cycle centered on rollouts from Waymo (GOOGL) and Cruise (GM) in the San Francisco Bay Area. Their fleet of robotaxis dominated headlines, as the sudden influx of autonomous vehicles divided residents over pedestrian safety and job automation. A deadly collision with a GM-backed Cruise robotaxi in Oct. 2023 heightened regulatory scrutiny and the company eventually exited the robotaxi business altogether

OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman has responded to Elon Musk’s offer to buy the artificial intelligence startup’s assets by saying it’s not for sale.
“OpenAI is not for sale,” Altman told Axios during the AI Action Summit in Paris. “OpenAI’s mission is not for sale — to say nothing of the fact that, like, a competitor who is not able to beat us in the market and you know, instead is just trying to say, like, ‘I’m gonna buy this’ with total disregard for the mission is a likely path there.”

The MSI Cubi NUC 13MQ is a compact computer that comes with a good range of ports, a helpful Vesa mount, and an external power button attachment. These included accessories make it easy to tuck the device out of sight for a minimalist look. However, it doesn't perform quite as well as expected, and it currently can only be found selling for much higher than its MSRP.

For this MSI Cubi NUC 13MQ review, I've been using the mini PC as my work computer for the last week. I've also run the compact computer through the usual gauntlet of benchmark tests to see how it compares to similarly configured devices on the market. While it isn't a stand-out mini PC, the MSI Cubi NUC 13MQ is a solid computer. Here's where it excels and where it could do better.
I'm a big fan of minimalism and when that can meet great performance, I know I've got an awesome product. I've put hundreds if not thousands of hours into testing mini PCs from various companies and I know what to look for when determining whether one of these devices is worth buying. 
This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by MSI. The company had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication.

• Price: $1,029.00 at B&H• CPU: Intel Core i7-1365U (10 cores, 12 threads, up to 5.2 GHz)• GPU: Intel Iris Xe Graphics (6 cores)• RAM: 16GB DDR5 @ 2,593 MHz • Storage: 1TB M.2 NVMe SSD• Connectivity: Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3• Dimensions: 135.6 x 132.5 x 50.10mm (5.34 x 5.22 x 1.97in) • Weight: 1.45kg (3.2lbs) • Warranty: 2-year
The exact MSI mini PC configuration I reviewed features an Intel Core i7-1365U vPro CPU (central processing unit) with an Intel Iris Xe Graphics GPU (graphics processing unit), 16GB RAM, and a 1TB SSD. It's also covered by a 24-month (2-year) warranty. According to MSI, this mini PC has an MSRP of $667.
I attempted to find this exact configuration online but couldn't find it anywhere; in fact, there were very few listings for the Cubi NUC 13MQ, and most of them were way more than the MSRP MSI informed me of. The closest configuration I found featured the same CPU, GPU, and SSD but had 32GB RAM instead of 16GB. However, this configuration sells for a whopping $1,229.00 at B&H, which is extremely costly for what's inside this device.
This is one of the biggest problems with the mini PC right now. Hopefully, there will be more rationally priced listings for this mini PC in the future. Until then, you can easily find less expensive alternatives on the market.

In addition to the mini PC, the box included the power adapter, power cable, VESA mount, and an external power button. Unlike many other mini PCs I've reviewed, no HDMI cables were included with the Cubi NUC 13MQ. As such, you will need to supply one yourself in order to connect this device to your monitor or TV.

You can use the included VESA mount to  attach it to the back of a monitor and use the included external power button to easily turn it off and on.

There are a number of mini PCs on the market that try to grab your attention with flashy RGB lighting or a futuristic design. Those have their place for people who want them, but it can also make them look awkward in professional settings. Meanwhile, the MSI Cubi NUC 13MQ fits into both casual and business settings thanks to its simple black casing.
Desk-space-wise, it only takes up as much room as a bagel, and it easily fits underneath your monitor. Alternatively, the included VESA mount makes it simple to connect the mini PC to the back of a compatible monitor or under a desk for a more clean look.
MSI includes an external power button on the end of a cable, which plugs into the side of the mini PC. The button even has adhesive on the underside, so you can stick it somewhere that it won't move. That way, you can easily turn it on and off regardless of where it is mounted instead of fumbling for the power button on the mini PC itself.

As far as accessories go, there are plenty of ports to accommodate displays, headphones, keyboards, a computer mouse, and more. In total, there are 2x Thunderbolt 4 ports, 2x USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports, 2x HDMI ports, 1x microSD card reader, 2x LAN ports, 1x headphone jack, and 1x external power switch slot. What's more, the Cubi NUC 13MQ can support up to four displays, so you can have a decent workstation.
To open the MSI Cubi NUC 13MQ, you simply unscrew the four screws within the rubber feet on the bottom of the device. From here, pull off the metal shield, and you'll be able to view the inside. Users can upgrade two SO-DIMM, two M.2 SSDs (2280 & 2242), and one 2.5"" HDD/SSD.
I had to be very patient during my time with the MSI Cubi NUC 13MQ since it frequently took longer than expected to complete certain tasks. For instance, there was a decent amount of waiting between clicking on Photoshop and the program actually showing up. Then, while working with Adobe's editing software, I frequently had to wait while the program performed edits at a slower rate than I was accustomed to. That said, the mini PC never crashed or was unable to complete an action I gave it.
As I always do, I started testing the mini PC's performance by opening Geekbench 6 and running a CPU test. The Intel Core i7-1365U got a single-core score of 2,298 and a multi-core score of 8,217. These scores are where we'd expected this processor to be. I also opened Cinebench and had the mini PC do a CPU rendering stress test. It earned a single-core score of 100 and a multi-core score of 426, which is very low.
After checking out the CPU, I turned my attention to the GPU by running 3DMark Time Spy. The mini PC got a score of 1,669, which is good for the Intel Iris Xe Graphics. However, I also ran the integrated graphics benchmark, Night Raid, to which the mini PC got a great score of 15,940.
To analyze the SSD, I ran CrystalDiskMark's sequential read and write test. The Cubi NUC 13MQ earned a 6,387 MB/s read speed, and a 5,653 MB/s write speed, which felt higher than I expected, given how often I had to wait for the mini PC to respond to certain commands. As another way to test the SSD, CPU, and GPU, I also had the mini PC transcode a 4K version of Tears of Steel in Handbrake. The Cubi NUC 13MQ took 4,725 seconds (1 hour and 18 minutes), which is a lot longer than several other mini PCs I've tested lately. It's really not a good result.
Finally, to round everything off, I opened CrossMark to check the overall system performance. At 1,518, the Cubi NUC 13MQ scored lower than desired but still within a reasonable range.
After running a CPU stress test in Cinebench for 20 minutes, I pulled out my thermal camera and took readings of the Cubi NUC MQ13. The top back of this mini PC peaked at 95.4 degrees F (35.2 degrees C) while the back vent area peaked at 128.7 degrees F (53.7 degrees C), which isn't too warm.
While the CPU stress test was still running, I pulled out a decibel meter and took measurements. Much like other mini PCs, this one doesn't have a fan, but air passing through the vents still makes noise. The Cubi NUC 13MQ registered at a peak of 49.8dB, which isn't very loud. However, a constant high-pitched whine that comes on as soon as the device gets powered on does make it hard for me to concentrate at times.

3/5 — While this mini PC doesn't offer bad performance, it does take a bit longer than desired to perform certain functions. The device also scored lower in certain benchmarks than expected, but it never crashed or froze.
Overall
3.5/5 — The Cubi NUC 13MQ is a decent mini PC with a healthy selection of ports, and helpful included accessories. However, performance isn't quite up to snuff and it's hard to find this device selling at a reasonable price at the time of writing. 

✅You are limited on space and want a small computer
Only taking up the desk space of a bagel, the MSI Cubi NUC 13MQ doesn't clutter up your work area. You can even use the included VESA mount to attach it behind your monitor.
✅You want to be able to mount your mini PC somewhere out of sight but still have an accessible power button
This MSI mini PC's included external power button makes it easy to turn the device on and off, even if it's mounted somewhere out of sight.
❌You specifically want a fast device that can handle gaming and graphically intensive programs
This mini PC does not have the power necessary to handle demanding games or software.
❌You would rather buy a less expensive mini PC
There are plenty of less expensive mini PCs on the market that offer solid performance.


The MSI Cubi NUC 13MQ is a compact computer that doesn't take up a ton of room. Using the included VESA mount, you can tuck it into a desk or behind a monitor. It also offers a good range of ports for your accessory and display connections.

73,2025-02-15,"This 1999 Honda Accord wagon is a Japanese-market example that was imported to the US in 2024, and it is powered by a 2.3-liter inline-four paired with a four-speed automatic transaxle. Finished in white over tan cloth upholstery, the car is equipped with roof rails, fog lights, clear front turn signals, a rear wiper, 15″ alloy wheels, window rain guards, automatic climate control, and a Carrozzeria infotainment head unit with navigation. Acquired by the selling dealer in 2024, this sixth-generation Accord wagon shows 129k kilometers (~80k miles) and is now offered at no reserve in California with a tool kit, Japanese-language owner’s manuals and service records, and a clean Virginia title.

White paint finishes the exterior, and further details consist of fog lights, clear front turn signals, roof rails, power-adjustable side mirrors, a rear wiper, and tinted rear windows. There are dents in the hood, roof, and three of the wheel arches, rust is shown on the left-rear wheel arch and rear hatch opening, and additional paint touch-ups and exterior imperfections are viewable in the walk-around video below.

The 15″ alloy wheels are mounted with 205/60 Yokohama Ecos tires that show 2012 production codes. The car is equipped with four-wheel disc brakes. Cracks are visible in the tire sidewalls.

The right-hand-drive cabin features front bucket seats and a rear bench that are trimmed in tan cloth with patterned inserts. Lace covers have been installed on the front headrests and seat backs, and additional appointments include a center armrest, woodgrain center console trim, automatic climate control, Accord-branded floor mats, a rear cargo area cover, and a Carrozzeria touchscreen head unit with navigation.

A four-spoke airbag steering wheel fronts a 180-km/h speedometer, a tachometer with a 6,250-rpm redline, and gauges for fuel level and coolant temperature. The digital odometer indicates 129k kilometers (~80k miles).

The 2.3-liter inline-four was rated at 150 horsepower and 158 lb-ft of torque, which is sent to the front wheels via a four-speed automatic transaxle. The oil was changed in January 2025. The windshield washer fluid reservoir neck is broken and the under-hood insulation pad is deteriorating. The car has not passed a California emissions test.

Additional underbody images are provided in the gallery below.

Japanese-language owner’s manuals and service records are included in the sale along with a tool roll.

The world is filled with loads of stuff. Some of it makes our lives easier, a few we can’t live without, others are purely just for fun. Then there are those that are utterly useless. Someone out there is always trying to make something better, or bigger/smaller, or faster. And new products are launched almost on a daily basis.
Deciding to introduce something to an already saturated market can be risky. You might lose money, damage your brand, and at worst, have to shut down your entire company if your product flops spectacularly. Of course, sometimes the risk is worth the reward. if you succeed, you could find yourself rolling in the dough.
When Google announced it was working on making wearable smart glasses, the world went wild. Well, some people did, anyway. Time Magazine named Glass one of the Best Inventions of 2012. Media mogul Tim O’Reilly tweeted: “I suspect that Google Glass may be a technology milestone to surpass the iPhone.” The product was officially launched in 2014. By 2015, it was dead and gone... Pulled from the market following epic failure to perform, among other things. When someone asked ""What product failed despite being actually pretty good?"", thousands of people added their two cents. Bored Panda has put together some of the top answers. Upvote your favorites and let us know in the comments what products you think should be on this list.

  The A&W 1/3 pound burger. Too many people can't do fractions, so they thought it was smaller than a quarter pounder. It was the same price as the quarter pounder, so it was actually a better deal.

The GridPad was the first one I remember. That came out running MS-DOS, but could read your handwriting with a stylus. Must have been early 1990s. There was also the Apple Newton around the same time. That ran a custom OS, it wasn't anything like iOS. Soon after that there was a version of Windows 3.1 called Windows for Pens, or sometimes Windows PEN. It was a decent OS, and much better that the Newton.

  Netscape Navigator was a great internet browser but unfortunately couldn't compete with IE being bundled on every PC and congress didn't break Microsoft's browser monopoly until after Navigator went away. 
   Deacalum  ,   OiMax / flickr    Report  
I remember when Netscape was released in the mid 90's. After using Mosaic for web browsing, seeing Navigator was a huge leap forward. Multi-threading! Images could all load at the same time instead of one by one! And then v2.0 came out with support for tables! What a time to be alive...
  Betamax was superior to VHS in most ways but still failed (mostly). I obviously chose the wrong 'side' in the fight but most people still believe it was a better product and survived for a bit until the industry picked one. 
   anon  ,   MIKI Yoshihito / flickr    Report  
Betamax had a short recording time and refused to allow adult entertainment. That is what killed it.
  The Concord 
   Sucondesenutz  ,   Eduard Marmet    Report  
The Concorde succeeded in everything it was designed to do. But the sonic boom meant that it couldn't fly supersonic over North America and other places, plus it was expensive to fly and maintain. Also, Air France and British Airways were the only airlines to operate it regularly, as most other airlines cancelled their orders. It was never built in sufficient numbers to render it profitable. It did have an excellent safety record, with only one incident resulting in loss of life (Air France 4590), but by the time of the accident the planes was becoming dated and nearing the end of their service life. Concorde was a remarkable aircraft, but in the real world, not a very practical one.
  ~~Fabreeze~~ Febreze. The only reason they added scents is because people didnt know that the ""original"" scent (neutral) was doing anything. Everyone thought it wasn't doing anything at all. 
   anon  ,   Mike Mozart / flickr    Report  
I nearly died once when someone sprayed Febreze at me when I came around a corner and walked in her door. Got me in the face. Couldn’t get to my inhaler fast enough. Had NO idea it’s that strong! Holy hell! And people pay MONEY to have all those chemicals in their homes?! Have they no brains?

  I don't know if it really was good or I was just young, but back around 2000 I had this, I think it was Panasonic, tiny little flip thing. It was one of the first things that was a video camera, still camera, and MP3 player. I've been searching to figure out what it was called for about 10 minutes now, it was amazing, about 3""x3"" and had video and still and SD port to put pictures or music on it. I was the coolest kid ever with that thing.

The Flip camera! I still have mine. Lots of sweet videos of the kids on it.
  The Wii U, several of the best games in their respective genres of all time, though most have been ported to the Switch 
   anon  ,   Toshiyuki IMAI / flickr    Report  
I have one. The idea of a controller with a screen should have meant an array of new game ideas. Instead it was gradually shunned by the major game companies and just faded from view.
  Polaroid cameras. You don't have to go to Walgreens to get them developed and with the newer ones tend to have as high a resolution as a regular digital camera.

  Bounce Dryer Bars you would stick on the inside of your dryer and last for over a month replacing individual sheets.

  There was a pancake batter in a whipped cream can I used to buy. It was great, you didn’t need to make a ton of batter just to have some pancakes (good for single people and college students), and it used good quality ingredients (and tasty!).The reason it failed, I think, was because it was sold exclusively though Whole Foods (IIRC), which isn’t the best market for pancake batter in a whipped cream can.That, and it was called “Batter Blaster”. 
   Headytexel  ,   Brett L. / flickr    Report  
Pancakes are so easy to make, Just three ingredients in one bowl: milk, eggs, & flour.

  The Xbox Kinect. First developed for the 360, instead of showcasing its capabilities they just went full Microsoft and crammed it down everyone’s throats by making it required hardware for the Xbone launch. Less than two years later it was dead tech. Whoever ran that campaign should never work in marketing again.

  I think the Palm Pre was under appreciated and had great features that were ahead of the competition. Like being able to scroll back and forth through open apps, swipe up to close, wireless charging, and a lot more. WebOS was just great. It was my first smart phone so maybe I’m just biased. To me it seemed so much more intuitive and versatile than early iOS or Android. 
   Al_of_Somewhere  ,   Abul Hussain / flickr    Report  
No, it was a very good phone. HP killed the brand for some reason, so there was never a follow up to it. I still have mine in my storage. Still worked the last time I pulled it out.

  Well I don’t if this counts as a “product”, but Princess and the Frog by Disney was considered a failure because it didn’t make as much money as they had hoped it would. Which was the final push to make them stop making 2D movies

  The Sims Online, i am still waiting for something similar 
   OilerP  ,   EA Games / Wikipedia    Report  
From what I am reading, Sims online wasn't a product that ""shouldn't have failed"". It was a product that failed for reasons, that might not have failed if done properly. I have never personally played any of the sims franchise - just seen others play it. But if I was playing it, most of what I'd want to do is essentially solo play. I wouldn't want to have to be online and pay a subscription for that. -=-- From the internet: """"The Sims Online"" failed due to a combination of factors, including limited features, repetitive gameplay, a subscription fee, and a lack of player-created content support, ultimately leading to a dwindling player base and EA's shift in focus to other, more profitable titles.

  I'm gonna say the PS Vita. There were multiple factors for it failing, but the device itself being of bad quality wasn't one of them (from my understanding). 
   anon  ,   Sergiy Galyonkin / flickr    Report  
Sony's biggest enemy with the Vita was Sony. Everything was proprietary and severely overpriced compared to non-proprietary equivalents (especially memory cards).

   brameliad    Report  
Yeah, it was better. I use Feedly myself, and every so often I think about upgrading to a paying version so that I can use filters (so I don't ever have to see posts about the Kardashians ever again, lol), but I refuse to pay a monthly subscription for that. I'd do a one-time fee, but I hate subscriptions for software or services.
 3D Doritos

  Google+ because of its botched launch. 
   AdvocateSaint  ,   ijeab / freepik    Report  
I love/hate Google products. So handy in many ways, but also so pushy. I google things that have nothing to do with my location, yet it asks. I could ask it about spotted owls or what a Honda Civic looks like and it will ask, ""Would you like to give your location for greater accuracy?"" And the option to save a password in Chrome is Save or Never but ""Never"" just means until the next time you log in because it asks me every single fricken time. Stuff like that. But very handy for searches and maps.

  MoviePass such a great idea, I wanted it to work so badly but its model is just unsustainable 
   Rainbowmitten37  ,   Maduro25 / reddit    Report  
But that’s just it: It was a horrible idea. Yeah, for consumers, it’s a dream come true, but as a product, there’s really no way to make it work, not unless the studios go along with the idea. Even as I took advantage of it, I knew was just a matter of time before it was ripped from my hands.
  Freespace 2. It was the greatest space sim of all time, with an amazing story, amazing multiplayer, and phenomenal graphics, but it was released when space sims were on the way out. Volition ended up filing for bankruptcy, and the IP is stuck in legal hell, so no word on if we'll ever get a FS3. 
   albus_scirocco  ,   Wikipedia  ,   Interplay Entertainment    Report  
There were many great space games and there still are some. Beside e.g. a whole bunch of Star Wars games we also got Freelancer, or nowadays Everspace 2.
  A bunch of Wendy's old menu items, specifically their Spicy Chicken Nuggets, Chicken Strips, and Frosty Milkshakes. I remember I lost 2 teeth on the same chicken strip when I was a kid, it was that good!

I don't know what you mean about frosty milkshakes but they still do have frostys.
  TITAN FALL 2 BAYBY. Like seriously it’s depressing how good the movement system, mechanics, gun play, and symbiosis you have with your titan and yet it has a very small player base. It’s campaign was astoundingly short yet sweet. It was probably the best fps game of 2016. If you have the Chance check it out. It’s is always on sale. See you on the frontier pilots. 
   911wuzaninsidejob  ,   MobyGames    Report  
What killed it, was the fact that its campaign was so short. The first game didn't actually have a single player campaign, and while it was popular, it didn't have the overall player retention that the developer hoped. So, when Titanfall 2 was released, they created a 'single player campaign' for it that can be completed in at most six hours, and at best, three. They still marketed it toward the multiplayer combat aspect of the game, and the campaign was VERY weak. You could tell that the campaign was added as an after thought. Well, it didn't help matters, as players didn't really see a reason to go back to the campaign after completing it, and the multiplayer aspect of the game was more like Fortnite, with insanely skilled 12 year olds talking smack and cursing, and repeatedly shooting you in the face. The game deserved to fail.

Those Sweet Story Lifesavers box books you used to get for Christmas. I so loved Rumbutter.
You can still get those "" books"" I buy them every year! They aren't as many rolls as the ones from the 70's but still.. and you can still get the rum ones! I buy them by the bag or rolls.
NOIKA phones
Great phones, and they doubled as hammers in a pinch. 😂
Don't forget their iconic ringtone.
They may not still be being manufactured, but more Nokia phones than cockroaches will survive global thermonuclear war...
I'm confused- a lot of these didn't fail, they just didn't last forever. Like Snapchat, it was hugely successful, just social media platforms don't stay current forever.

Fallen angels (as represented by the ICE US Fallen Angel High Yield 10% Constrained Index, “H0CF”) began 2025 on a positive note, outperforming the broad high-yield market (as represented by the ICE BofA US High Yield Index, “H0A0”) by 0.10% (1.48% vs. 1.38%). The outperformance was driven by declining interest rates and tightening credit spreads, particularly in the Real Estate sector, which is the second largest overweight versus broad high yield, behind Retail. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield fluctuated throughout the month, peaking at 4.79% before settling at 4.52%. The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) held interest rates steady in January and is expected to maintain this stance until the summer, although we anticipate that expectations will continue to adjust based on new data points. Lower-rated bonds continued last year’s trend of leading performance, with the CCC & below index returning 1.64%, compared to 1.42% for single-B rated bonds and 1.29% for BB-rated bonds.
Fallen angels are off to a strong start this year. We believe interest rates will remain a key driver of returns in 2025, as they currently account for approximately 65% of total yield. Additionally, credit spreads can remain tight for extended periods, as corporate fundamentals take time to shift. Since 2003, there have been 6 periods—lasting between 0.4 and 3.9 years—where high-yield spreads remained below their historical average and fallen angels outperformed by approximately 3%. Fallen angels have underperformed by 2% during the current period, which has now reached 2.5 years. This makes it an outlier compared to historical trends. However, the current tight spread period is not over, and wider spreads would likely reflect a changing credit environment in which fallen angels could benefit, for example due to a higher volume of new fallen angels, higher quality or evolving sector themes.

Fallen Angels Overall Statistics: Fallen angels and broad high yield spreads continue tightening, with broad high yield reaching its post global financial crisis (GFC) low of 259bps in late January, although it finished the monthly slightly higher. Yields remained relatively high for both indices, albeit slightly lower than at the beginning of the year.

Fallen Angels: Aptiv PLC junior subordinated debt was downgraded by Fitch to BB+ from BBB-, as the company is planning to spin off its electrical distribution systems business into a separate company. Fitch states that the downgrade aligns more closely with other similarly junior subordinated debt from other issuers. Over the last six months, the junior subordinated debt price decreased to $99.71 from $101.05. Within the Auto sector, S&P affirmed Ford’s BBB- rating in early February but revised its outlook to negative, as Ford’s expansion over the next couple of years appears to be limited due to slower-than-expected progress on cost reduction, high labor costs and increasing pricing pressure. S&P stated that the negative outlook also reflects an increase in the risk of downgrade over the next 12-24 months, which could make Ford a fallen angel again, all else equal, as Moody’s credit rating is Ba1 while Fitch is BBB-.

Rising Stars: None in January.
Fallen Angels Performance by Sector: With Aptiv PLC entering the index this past month, the Auto sector is back on the fallen angel index since the exit of Ford in November 2023. There were no major changes to sector composition, with Retail, Telecom and Real Estate still accounting for approximately 50% exposure, in aggregate, of the index. In January, all but two sectors registered positive returns, with Real Estate taking the lead with a 3.42% total return as its spreads tightened by 88bps. Real Estate is still the only sector with spreads above the 300 level, which may continue to provide upside if spreads continue to grind tighter. The worst performing sector in January was Transportation, although it is represented by only one issuer/bond (XPO Inc). In terms of sector attribution vs broad high yield, Real Estate and Retail were the top contributors to relative outperformance while the lack of Media exposure continued to hurt the fallen angel index.

77,2025-02-15,"Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies.
Here’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry.
Adobe (ADBE) released a beta version of its Firefly Video Model to the public this week — the market’s first commercially safe generative AI model for video, according to the company. The AI video model is available through Adobe’s new Firefly app and Premiere Pro with Generative Extend.
The Firefly app integrates with Adobe’s other applications such as Photoshop and Express, so creators can use it for text-to-video generation, video storyboards, and more.
“Firefly is designed for creative professionals looking for unmatched creative control and IP-friendly tools that can be used safely and effectively in both ideation and production,” David Wadhwani, president of Adobe’s digital media business, said in a statement. “We’ve been thrilled to hear from beta customers who’ve found it a game-changer for ideating concepts and producing stunning videos, and we can’t wait to see how the creative community uses it to bring their stories to the world.”
Personal AI startup PIN AI launched a mobile app this week with a native large language model that allows users to protect their data. 
By having a personal data bank with PIN AI, users can have control over their data, while allowing AI developers access to insights on their behavior, such as their shopping and investing habits, to create personalized AI experiences across apps such as Gmail and social media platforms.
“Unlike Big Tech monopolies that hoard data and suppress competition, PIN AI empowers users to protect and control their data,” PIN AI co-founder Bill Sun said. “It’s a revolutionary alternative to the exploitative practices of the current AI landscape represented by Big Tech and rising AI native monopolizers. We’re laying the groundwork for the agent economy where your Personal AI interacts with the external AI agent ecosystem interconnecting individual intent with a world of services.”
Chip startup Positron announced a $23.5 million funding round this week for U.S.-made, energy-efficient chips that can be an alternative to Nvidia’s (NVDA). The round was backed by Flume Ventures, Valor Equity Partners, Atreides Management, and Resilience Reserve. 
The startup is already shipping chips to data centers and neoclouds throughout the U.S.
“With this funding, we’re scaling at a pace that AI hardware has never seen before–from expanding shipments of our first-generation products to bringing our second generation accelerators to market in 2026,” Mitesh Agrawal, CEO of Positron, said in a statement. “Our solution is growing rapidly because it outperforms conventional GPUs in both cost and energy efficiency, while delivering AI hardware that eliminates reliance on foreign supply chains.”
AI video creator Synthesia launched Selfie Avatars this week as part of its AI avatar service. Users can create custom, talking avatars by uploading images of themselves. 
The Selfie Avatars are experimental, the company said, adding that it has done testing to prevent harmful content such as non-consensual deepfakes.
“This feature marks an exciting milestone for Synthesia as we continue to innovate and shape the next generation of AI avatars coming later this year,” the company said in a statement.
Chipmaker Groq announced this week that it secured a $1.5 billion commitment from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to expand its partnership and deliver advanced LPU-based AI inferencing infrastructure. 
In December, Groq built the largest inference cluster in the Middle East, and brought it online in eight days. Saudi Araba is working on its Vision 2030 goal of having an AI-powered economy.
“It’s an honor for Groq to be supporting the Kingdom’s 2030 vision,” Jonathan Ross, CEO and founder of Groq, said in a statement. “We are excited to work alongside Saudi innovators to shape the next chapter of AI.”"

Brit posted the vid Friday night ... doing her dance in a practically see-through lacey black top and thong with matching black boots and a hat.
As she has done in several dance videos ... she rubbed along her toned body, making sure to highlight her assets -- but she added a little extra for V-Day when she spanked herself a few times before nearly pulling down her thong to show full-on peach!
There was no caption for the vid ... and Brit turned off the comment section ... but she sure seemed to be having a good time being an epic tease on the day of love.
Earlier in the week ... TMZ broke the news Brit's old Beverly Hills home -- where she was famously stretchered out during her 2008 health troubles -- is on the market ... and it’s packing one serious price tag!

82,2025-02-15,"How this cookbook author fixed her walls in a weekend.
Cookbook author Stacey Mei Yan Fong has lived in Singapore, Indonesia, Hong Kong—and that’s only naming a few. Growing up, she moved constantly, hopping between apartments, neighborhoods, and countries. So when she found a rent-stabilized Brooklyn apartment on Craigslist in 2011, she knew she was staying put. “I think that's the reason why I haven't left—it's so nice because this space is mine,” she said. Fourteen years later, she’s still there, and if she has her way, she’s keeping it in the family for as long as possible.
The recipe developer and design obsessive describes her aesthetic as a modern take on a ’70s basement, balancing vintage finds with fresh, contemporary touches. Her walls are an ever-changing gallery of posters, a collection she’s built over the years. “If a concert has a screen-printed poster, I buy it,” she said.
Stacey has continually reinvented her apartment, swapping out art, furniture, and decor to match her evolving tastes. Most recently, after a bathroom ceiling collapse led to a full renovation, she saw an opportunity rather than an inconvenience. She enlisted her friend Kate Zaremba, a wallpaper designer, and together, they covered the new walls in a bold wavy black-and-white pattern. A few simple swaps later, and in less than a week, her bathroom felt brand new.
Curious how she makes a rental feel like home? We caught up with Stacey to dive into the project and get her best tips for refreshing a space without starting from scratch.
The first thing Stacey did when she moved in was paint the walls. ""Stock white just wasn’t for me,"" she said. But more recently, she’s sworn by wallpaper. ""It completely transformed the space. Typically, you can only change things up by painting, but wallpaper felt like the way to go.""
While wallpaper  might seem like a big undertaking, Stacey insists it’s actually easier—and much cleaner than grabbing a gallon of eggshell. “I think people are intimidated by it, but you just have to be patient and set the time aside. And if you’re renting (like Stacey)? No worries—she notes that wallpaper can always be steamed off or even painted over.
Stacey’s approach to design is simple: nothing in your home has to be permanent. “Since I’ve been in my apartment so long, I redo the space every few years—just to keep it fresh.” Whether it’s wallpaper, paint, or through rearranging furniture, she believes in changing things up as often as you like. “If you don’t end up loving it, take a beat and switch it out. It’s a long project, and that’s what’s lovely about it,” she said.
If you’re renting, she recommended keeping original fixtures stored in labeled bags for easy swaps once you move out. As for paint, “Just don’t go with black,” she warned.
Another super simple way to update your space is changing out light switch covers. “The ones in rentals are usually painted over a thousand times,” Stacey said. She found unique ones on Etsy and has her eye on designs by artist Lorien Stern—specifically, these ghost-like figures that add a playful touch.
She also suggests centering a design around a favorite object or piece of art. “Pulling colors and inspiration from one standout piece can help create a cohesive look,” she said. Whether it’s a concert poster or a vintage print, start small, and build from there.
Although installing the wallpaper took just a few hours, it was made even easier—and way more fun—with some extra hands. “When the idea of wallpapering the bathroom felt intimidating, Kate [Zaremba] said she’d help us install it,” Stacey said.
Her roommate had worked with Kate before, and was in on the project from the start. “That’s kind of the New York, Brooklyn way—you know someone who knows someone,” she said. That said, Stacey and her roommate, both design school grads, could have managed on their own. They mapped everything out to scale on paper first, set up cutting and wetting stations, and used an X-Acto knife to get every seam just right.
Over the years, Stacey has embraced a slower, more intentional approach to decorating. “I mull over things, and I think that makes the end result so much more satisfying,” she said.
The same went for choosing wallpaper—she and Kate sifted through different prints before finding the perfect one. “We wanted something fun, bold, and graphic, but not just a typical stripe—so the wiggle design was perfect.”
“People try to do everything at once—they hang all their art in one day,” she said. “But as someone who’s been in her space a long time, there are still things I haven’t hung because I’m still thinking about them.” But the wallpaper is up—for now at least.

If you've been holding out for a new processor, this is a great deal.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Today, the AMD Ryzen 7 5800XT CPU is available at Amazon for one of its lowest prices ever—at least according to data from Camel Camel Camel. It debuted last year with a recommended price of around $249, but right now, it's discounted to just $139. This might not be one of the newest processors on the market, but the deal was too notable to pass up.
If you want a better idea of how this processor compares to others on the market, check out our list of the best CPUs to see which ones are our favorites. We also have a CPU hierarchy list that compares benchmarking data if you want to examine each processor's specs.
AMD Ryzen 7 5800XT: now $139 at Amazon (was $249)
The AMD Ryzen 7 5800XT has eight cores for 16 threads. It can reach speeds as high as 4.8 GHz and has PCIe 4.0 support. This is the lowest price we've seen for the processor since it was first released last year.
The AMD Ryzen 7 5800XT features Zen 3 architecture with eight cores for 16 threads. Its base speed is 3.8 GHz, but with Max Boost enabled, it can reach as high as 4.8 GHz. According to AMD, this particular edition supports PCIe 4.0.
Regarding memory, you can install up to 128GB of DDR4-3200 via two memory channels. It has no integrated graphics, so you need an external GPU to get off the ground. This is a pretty good deal for a processor with these specs, even if it isn't the fastest or newest on the market. As of this writing, we're unsure how long the offer will be available.

As reported by VGC, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is nearing two million units sold across all platforms just under two weeks after it hit one million on its launch day alone. This has apparently ""reminded"" developer Warhorse's parent company, The Embracer Group, that selling good games that people like and want to buy is an important part of the business.
“The success of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a reminder of our core⁠—to bring great products to the market,” Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors said in response to the news. “High-quality teams need to have the resources and the time to execute their visions. When you have the right teams, this trust benefits everyone, including gamers, employees, and shareholders. I am convinced that we will remain among the industry leaders in our core business verticals in the future.”
Which is the kind of observation that should seem obvious to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the industry, but is rapidly becoming a radical stance among the C-suite set as the experienced teams behind beloved games are forced to crunch on ill-considered projects outside their expertise or interest areas, then shut down when those games inevitably flop. Embracer's own Daedalic Entertainment had a good thing going making 2D adventure games before it was tasked with the now-infamous licensed triple-A action-adventure, The Lord of the Rings: Gollum. Daedalic has since laid off a third of its staff and pivoted away from developing its own games entirely.
The Embracer Group was one of the first major publishers to succumb to the still-ongoing games industry layoff crisis, while its many layoffs and cancellation of a new Deus Ex game particularly stung in the face of the conglomerate's multi-year industry spending spree, acquiring the likes of Gearbox (since sold to Take-Two) Saber (sold to Beacon Interactive), Dark Horse Comics, Eidos Montreal, Plaion, and more.
But if the novel idea that good videogames with sufficient time and investment behind them will sell well and be good for the business in the long run really sinks in, who am I to stay bitter about the past? Congratulations to Warhorse Studios on its massive sales success for a delightfully weird game, at least.

	One year ago, production in Prague had hit a worrying lull, with an uncharacteristic slowdown apparent on the usually booked soundstages and bustling streets of the Czech capital. Normally one of Europe’s busiest production hubs, the Czech Republic was feeling the impact of both the Hollywood strikes and the turmoil at its rebate system, which was closed for new applications for most of 2023.

	“If you look back to this time last year, it was pretty dead. The number of calls I was getting, the number of budgets I was doing, the number of scouts we were putting on was very [small],” says David Minkowski, head of production at leading production services outfit Stillking. “Cut to today, and it’s almost back to where it was pre-strike.”

	The turnaround is partly a consequence of Hollywood’s bounce-back from the 2023 labor stoppages, which impacted production globally. But a bigger boost has come from the introduction of a new audiovisual law that its backers say will both modernize the Czech industry and make it more competitive with neighboring countries in the restless arms race to attract more foreign productions.




			Popular on Variety		






	“The Czech Film Fund had to adapt, as its original framework was no longer sufficient,” says Helena Bezděk Fraňková, CEO of the newly christened Czech Audiovisual Fund. “It was necessary to respond to the audiovisual policies of other countries. The world is changing, and we have to change with it.”

	The new-look audiovisual law will be introduced to industry professionals during the Berlinale Series at this year’s EFM, where the Czech Audiovisual Fund is partnering with the Berlinale Co-Production Market to host a panel on Feb. 18. Participants will include Fraňková; Petr Tichý, CEO of Prague’s historic Barrandov Studios; and Vratislav Šlajer, chairman of the Assn. of Audiovisual Producers.

	Among the key provisions in the new legislation is an increase in the country’s production incentive from 20% to 25% for live-action projects, as well as the introduction of an incentive of 35% for digital production and animation. The maximum amount that can be claimed per project tripled to nearly $19 million.

	The revamped Czech Audiovisual Fund will also support a broader range of productions than its predecessor, offering selective support mechanisms not only for films but for series, video games and animated projects. Its budget is expected to rise dramatically thanks to a provision that will collect levies from global streaming platforms for the first time; those funds will in turn be matched by the state, with the total budget estimated at $92 million a year.

	










	The industry’s response has been bullish, with Tomáš Hrubý, of leading TV production outfit Nutprodukcia, describing the law’s passage as a “great success,” and Šlajer, of the producers association, insisting: “It’s going to really kickstart the Czech audiovisual industry.” Minkowski says the overhauled incentive scheme “absolutely puts us closer to where we should be” in order to continue attracting foreign productions like “Nosferatu,” the Oscar contender that was largely filmed at Barrandov. 

	The changes will radically overhaul domestic production, giving a dramatic boost to a TV industry struggling to stay afloat, with the Czech public broadcaster beset by financial woes and global streaming platforms sluggish to enter the local market. (“We still haven’t seen an original show from Netflix,” notes Hrubý.) Meanwhile, Martin Vandas, of prolific animation house Maur Film, which is premiering the stop-motion animated feature “Tales From the Magic Garden” in the Berlinale’s Generation Kplus strand, says the incentives will bolster the Czech Republic’s historically robust animation sector and will “open up the possibilities of developing and producing TV series and co-producing them with domestic TV and foreign partners.”

	The prospect of forging new pathways into the international market is a tantalizing one for local talents — and a necessary step toward the Czech industry’s growth. “There is a new generation that is more globally experienced as an audience, and as creators,” says Šlajer. “What we need now is stronger financing…[and] more international connection — being more global in terms of the types of projects we produce and create, but also be able to be stronger co-production partners.”

	Director Jiří Mádl, whose gripping period drama “Waves” was shortlisted for the best international feature Academy Award, thinks the Czech industry is ripe for an awakening. “I feel we’re in good shape — better than in previous years,” he says. “What I think we’re missing now is the attention of the outside world.”  

	Mádl’s “Waves,” which follows a dogged group of investigative journalists on the eve of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact’s 1968 invasion of the Czech Republic, is fittingly set at a time when Czech cinema blossomed. Could the world be ready for another Czech New Wave? 

	










	“I feel something is growing,” he says. “It’s about to explode. I feel we’re on the verge of something.”
