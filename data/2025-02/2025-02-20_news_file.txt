This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with George Youmans, cofounder of the social tonic Hiyo, a non-alcoholic beverage startup that recently partnered with Constellation Brands. It has been edited for length and clarity.

        I cut my teeth out of college at Red Bull in their entertainment and music marketing division — it was awesome, but I had a bit of cognitive dissonance with the product itself.
    

        I consider myself an amateur biohacker, so I'm very conscious about what I put in my body. Drinking Red Bulls all the time wasn't exactly what I wanted to be putting my time and effort into. I learned a lot working there, but ultimately, you want to be able to really believe in the brand that you're building, so there was a bit of a misalignment.
    

        The idea for Hiyo came when one of my co-founders, Evan, and I were thinking through a bunch of different ideas around starting a company — he was getting his MBA at UCLA, and for the final project for his thesis, he had to start a business. During that period back in April 2019, we both had family members hospitalized with some alcohol-related issues.
    

        It was a weird coincidence and, frankly, a pretty traumatic experience, but it caused us to cut back on our drinking out of solidarity with those family members. And as we did, we saw a pretty profound need for a product like Hiyo in our lives and in the lives of those we loved. The options were boring soda water and lime or sugary, syrupy mocktails — and those were not really leading to a healthier lifestyle.
    

        It was obvious that there was a surging demand for high-end non-alcoholic drinks that didn't feel like a sacrifice, so we wanted to try to create an alternative to alcohol that you could be proud to hold. We wanted the flavor profiles to be complex and refreshing enough to deserve their place at that table when you usually have cocktails or full-bodied wines.
    

        We also wanted a nutritional facts panel that felt guiltless, with all organic ingredients. Finally, it had to be functional. I think the main reason people drink is that they want to feel something; they want stress relief, to feel relaxed and social. So we tried to tap into those feelings by using adaptogens and nootropics.
    

        We worked for a very long time to finalize that perfect stack of ingredients that elicited that feeling. For me, drinking Hiyo almost feels a little bit like a runner's high. I don't know exactly how to describe what I feel, but I know that I feel good, and it's pleasant, so we called it the ""float."" I think the functionality of the drink is such a critical piece of this because the world's f—ing stressful, and people need a way to unwind. We wanted to be able to provide a healthy version of that thing that we all need at the end of the week or the end of a long day.
    

        We launched in May 2021. We grew 3 times in retail last year and are looking to double this year — and we've just announced a new deal with Constellation Brands.
    

        I think what attracted Constellation to Hiyo is they're recognizing the shifting landscape of consumer behavior, with people drinking alcohol less often, and they're focused on really owning that celebration and that social occasion space.
    

        People are looking to drink less, whether they're completely sober or they're moderating. About 87% of our customers are people who are just drinking less, not completely sober people, and I think Constellation saw us as one of — if not the — fastest-growing brands in our space.
    

        Typically, when strategic investors come in at this stage, they're looking to potentially have a path toward an acquisition. Part of their investment is to help support that brand to accelerate its growth, and, in our case, Constellation has come out and said they want 25% of their portfolio to be non-alcoholic by around 2030. So we know they have that intentionality, and a big way they're going to do that is through the ventures group of the Constellation Brands team of finding great, younger, non-alcoholic brands — I'm just so proud Hiyo is one of them.

Karp is as coherent as a soup sandwich. Someone who claims to be a socialist and marxist, but also owns a 200 bil dollar company and prattles on about the evils of ""woke"".
If he's a marxist, he's unlike any marxist I've heard of, and I did a minor in pol-sci and consider myself somewhat marxist-sympathetic myself (I think marx's use of adam smiths labor theory of value to map out the substructures of capitalism are brilliant. I dont necessarily agree with his take what we should do about it, because I think its a very different world than the mid 1800s, but his description of the inner workings of capitalism are shockingly logical and on point, even now)
If he's a marxist, he's unlike any marxist I've heard ofFriedrich Engels, the rich factory owner who supported Marx and himself wrote a great part of the fundamental works of Marxism.

If we accept Mussolini's definition (and we should, because he introduced fascism) then fascism and Marxism are not mutually exclusive. An example - the Soviet-style socialism/communism/whatever it was.
 Lenin saw the Communist Party as a highly committed intellectual elite who were committed to attaining this power by any means possible, including violence and revolution if necessary. If the conditions of Russia in its backward state of development did not lead to socialism naturally, then, after coming to power, the Bolsheviks would legislate socialism into existence and would exercise despotic control to break public resistance. Thus, every aspect of the Soviet Union’s political, economic, cultural, and intellectual life came to be regulated by the Communist Party in a strict and regimented fashion that would tolerate no opposition.You will be socialist, and if not straight to jail.  Score too many points in a communist basketball game, believe it or not? jail. right to jail.

Mussolini, now he expected the corporations to be fully subservient to the state, an extension of his own body if you will, since he viewed himself as the ""brain"" of fascism. In his view, all of society exists to serve the fascist state, and that is the only justification for anybody's existence in it.


Kind of like a CEO who rules a private company. Except the company is the whole country with everything and everyone in it. And the decisions that the CEO makes have to be adapted in this setting. For example, if an employee/citizen doesn't perform satisfactorily, how do you fire them? Firing them means they get kicked out of the country, and the most efficient way to do that is to disappear them and kill them. Same with employees/citizens who speak up or complain about company policies. Same with employees/citizens who want to resign.
You get the idea, that's Mussolini's fascism.
Sounds like la Presidenta's fascism. He's already said he wanted to send Americans convicted of crimes to jails outside of the country. 'tis but a short step announce new class of crimes, mostly involving people against him.
Benito Mussolini defined fascism as the merger of corporatism and the government.More accurately he said ""the initial stages of fascism should more correctly be called corporatism because it's the merger of state and corporate power"". 

The later stages of fascism were not nearly as pretty mind you.

But the important thing to know is that Corporatism is not about corporations.  Sure, they share the root 'corpus', but that's it.  Corporatism is a structure for managing an economy.  Command economies in particular.  

The idea stems from Marx's reification - treating the nation as a single body (hence the corpo- root).  Government breaks the economy down by industrial sector and has representatives from capital and labor 
Which is why Bernie Sanders is openly calling it an oligarchy.

“Both parties have shifted well to the right, the Republicans almost off the spectrum. Respected conservative commentator Norman Ornstein described them, plausible, as a ‘radical insurgency’ that has largely abandoned parliamentary politics. Democrats now are mostly what used to be called ‘moderate Republicans.’ There’s ample evidence that most of the population, at the lower end of the income spectrum, is effectively disenfranchised – their representatives pay no attention to their opinions. Moving up the income ladder, influence increases slowly, but it’s only at the very top that it has real impact. Plutocracy masquerading as formal democracy.” ~ Noam Chomsky

I havent agreed with everything old Chompy has said (I dislike immensely his take on the Ukraine war) but damn if I aint gonna miss the old boys wisdom when the innevitable happens (very soon I suspect, he's 96 and his health is failing) and he passes off this this mortal coil.
But he's got an eye for bullshit, and boy does he ever have a point on the Dems. Whilst individual dems (like AOC and Bernie) are still reliably left wing, the old guard are just as much a party of Wall Street elite  as the Republicans (even if the GOP is a little more obnoxious about it, trying to hand over running the country to the tech-bros).
People are super disenfranchised. They want change, but the only change on offer has been hard-right, even though going that way is objectively against the self interest of the working and middle classes. People still do it because *something* has to change, and an old blowhard ranting about ""elites"" and ""deep states"" and nonsense like that at least *smells* like change, even if frankly it hasnt exactly been good change.

""Unelected Bureacrat"" is a just a thought-stopping cliche way of saying ""Public servent""
If you had to vote for every public servent, you'd be filling in 9 million ballots every 4 years.
But the public service always had a code that they DONT get involved in politics. Well until that recent executive order that just just got passed ending that.
Before we had a public service, now we really do have a ""Deep state"", courtesy of Trump. And yes, the Elites are in charge still. Even more so now that the most elite o 
The problem is this isn't left versus right anymore. Left versus right is just divide and conquer while all our political parties are owned and controlled by upper class influences based on campaign contributions and political lobbying.

Single topic issues are all propaganda designed to shut down your brain so you can be silenced. 'They' control the narrative and you thinking single topic voters matter is part of the narrative so you waste your time with stupid shit instead of dealing with the person positioning themselves to fully own you, the things you care about, and everything you have created.

i hardly think big pharma is going to pay Bernie Sanders for denouncing them, but,, hey trolling tell us we're on the right side, keep up with your abuse, I wouldn't want to be disappointed
He's exactly right which is why people need to be dismissive. Neither Chomsky nor others have moved. They are steadfast and honorable people who don't need to move from an ethical stand point, you trolls on the other hand dance like cold drops on a hot surface""classism creates abuse and we can see that here
typical slur, how about you explain his flawed reasoning so we can understand if your criticism is valid

Conservatism resists change, liberalism embraces change.  Which ideology is more likely to move in any direction?  The one that prefers change.  But, from their frame of reference, if they move away from the center, it may appear that everyone else moved in the opposite direction.  

There are two reasons the far-Left claims that the Right is the extreme ideology.  One is the issue I just described; the o 
So would most other countries in existence. It's not a good definition. Major parts of Fascism are also nationalism, authoritarianism/totalitarianism and militarism. These parts probably seemed too obvious to mention to Mussolini.

Corporatism is not, ""corporations control government"", it's, ""government utterly dominates businesses and labor"".
By that definition the United States has been a fascist state for decades at least, regardless of who the president happened to be or which party he purported to represent.Both Sides!

You're doing the math wrong. There is a majority (approving + indifferent, who'll do nothing) that gives the orange shitgibbon enough leeway to do what he wants.
Add to that the rule of thumb that one in a hundred of the unhappy will consider doing something, and you're having a pretty comfortable situation for the donold.
That he will last long enough to fuck up the US good is a very safe bet.
Of course, that is my point. Since nobody cares, shit will continue in the same direction.

Sadly, not much, except that vote manipulators have gone way up from the reagan-thatcher level ruthlessness.

Palantir is that part of the US that does with the US Government those things that the intelligence and SMUs do for other countries.  The US just has a better PR program.  SO, for example, when Israel's NSO Group does something it gets that long-ass title.  But when the US's Palantir corp does something there's no need to say ""US"".  When the Israeli Pegaus software.... but when Palantir hacks a nation it's just a corporatoin.
Palantir is evil. It's hard to call an entire corporation evil, but it is.  They have good people there. I have two friends who are devs there and they're not evil... but they know they are working on evil things, and we don't email from work to each other.
Peter Thiel is evil.  He destroyed an entire publishing outfit for... them having told the truth.  Most of us don't care if he's gay or not but somehow this became a raison d'etre to kill Gawker Media.  Why?  How did this improve the world?  I'm assuming you fellow /. readers agree that improving the world is a good thing and ""taking down"" media that speaks truth is not a good thing.
When the CEO of Palantir talks about sucking ""the government's"" parts he means the US Government.  He never says US.  See paragraph 1.  Easy to blame the Israelis... whose software is used throughout the US Federal Government, states, and police departments.  But ... he just says ""government"" and the media laps it up and repeats it.
China does the same thing.  So does AU, UK, NZ, CA so we got all Five Eyes Countries and the Chinese and the Russians and the Israelis.  Wanna bet Turkey and Saudi (""Kill Kashogi violently"") and Somalia and the rest don't?  They all do.  But hey let's shelack over that.
You may think ""Oh well it's the US Government so 'we' are the 'good guys' so it's all ok.""  It is not.""
Everything in this post I stand by as truth and fact.  I've avoided using pejorative words.  This is YOUR opportunity to STAND UP and say ""Yeah that's right"" or ""No you're full of crap; the US Government is awesome and Elon Skunk is awesome and Doggy will give me $5K and Trump wears trucker hats so he's cool.""

In a way Palantir does the same that modern ""Tech""-Companies do. They collect and centralize data to profit of it. However while you might still see some benefit from companies like Google, Apple, Facebook and the like, Palantir does this explicitly to prop up elites.
While the destruction of society may be a side-effect for most companies, it is the goal of Palantir. Apple and Google probably will cooperate with problematic governments (if forced to, e.g. by money) but it's not their goal. For Palantir such activities are their business model.
If Trump wants a list of all transgender people in the US, Apple and Google probably would take at least a week to compile that list, Palantir probably already has it ready.
Trump says anyone saving the country is not breaking the law, we all know that cuts both ways.
Palantir wants tech patriotism? Do they have any idea what that would look like when everything they do is unconstitutional? They are asking to be destroyed. I hope they get it.
That particular combination of concepts leaves me with a SERIOUS case of the heebee jeebees.

The PV5 will come in versions for passengers and cargo.
by  Andrew J. Hawkins
Kia revealed the exterior design of the upcoming PV5 electric van, the automaker’s first EV to come out under its “Platform Before Vehicle” (PBV) brand.
With the PV5, Kia has declared its intention to compete with heavy hitters like the Volkswagen ID Buzz, Ford E-Transit, Mercedes eSprinter, and Ram ProMaster EV. There are very few electric vans on the market today, but that looks to be changing with these new entrants.
The PV5 will come in a number of configurations, depending on whether you want something for cargo delivery, rideshare, or just to fulfill your #vanlife fantasies. There will also be models built for specialized conversions, which is sure to thrill the van conversion aftermarket.
While the passenger version features a large window area, the cargo variant emphasizes space efficiency with a clean, modern look. Kia didn’t offer any details about its powertrain, range, price, or availability.
The PV5 will be the first of many PBV-branded vehicles to come from Kia. PBV was introduced during CES 2024 in Las Vegas as a family of EVs built on a flexible vehicle architecture, with different swappable body types. The vehicle can be transformed from a minivan to a full-size van to a small truck, depending on the specific need. The driver cab remains fixed, while the rest of the vehicle is interchangeable, like a real-life Duplo set.
At the time, Kia said that the PV5 would be ideal for ridehailing, delivery, and utilities. Uber swooped in soon after to sign a memorandum of understanding to add the PV5 as an option for its drivers in the hopes of fulfilling its pledge to go all-electric in all markets by 2040.
Kia said it will reveal more details about the PV5, as well as a new model, at its Kia EV Day in Spain later this month. A heavily camouflaged PV5 was spotted by Electrek earlier this month in the US.

The manifesto found on Luigi Mangione before he was charged with killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson doesn't spend much time discussing the quality of healthcare in America. It doesn't mention any of the specific health issues Mangione had complained about on Reddit or any frustrations he may have had with receiving treatment. Instead, the bulk of the note talks about the size of UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare.

        ""United,"" the note says, is one of America's largest companies by market cap, ""behind only Apple, Google, Walmart."" The company, it says, has ""simply gotten too powerful, and they continue to abuse our country for immense profit because the American public has allowed them to get away with it."" In other words, it seems Mangione wasn't upset about healthcare, per se — but was pissed off about monopolization. The backpack that was found in Central Park, which police believe belonged to Mangione, was stuffed with Monopoly money. (Mangione has pleaded not guilty to the shooting.)
    

        Though the manifesto gets some facts wrong — UnitedHealth actually stood at No. 14 by market cap at the time of the shooting — it references a very real trend: Over the past 40 years, the government has allowed an unprecedented level of consolidation in almost every major sector of American business. Whether we're buying office supplies or booking a vacation or searching the internet, we're often at the mercy of a handful of companies that dominate that particular corner of the economy. Despite a century of antitrust legislation and litigation, American business is bigger than ever.
    

        That's especially true when it comes to healthcare: The Government Accountability Office found that just three companies control at least 80% of the health insurance market in most states. UnitedHealth, in particular, has spent the past several years acquiring firms from across the healthcare sector, transforming the company into a vertically integrated behemoth that controls health insurance, medical services, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare data. Last year, the Department of Justice opened an antitrust investigation into the company, prompting UnitedHealth to drop two proposed acquisitions. The DOJ also sued to block UnitedHealth's acquisition of Amedisys, a rival provider of home healthcare — a move which UnitedHealth has called an overreach it will ""vigorously defend against.""
    

        Of course, companies consolidate for all sorts of reasons. For one, size allows them to take advantage of economies of scale. A report by accounting giant PwC found that large hospitals have a lower cost per patient, since they can share resources and treat patients faster. Insurance companies also save money by serving a large customer base — the more people they cover, the lower the risk (and cost) for each person. In a statement, UnitedHealth says, ""The $5 trillion US health system remains deeply fragmented and rooted in fee-for-service models that result in less-than-optimal patient outcomes, higher mortality rates, poor patient experience, redundant care, and waste. We're accelerating the transition from volume to value as it's essential that we move beyond a transaction-based health system to a model that is proactive, outcomes-driven and enables people stay healthy over the course of a lifetime.""
    

        But monopolization comes at a steep cost. When a market is controlled by just a few corporations, economists have found, companies can hold customers captive and offer shoddier products and services, simply because consumers don't have any meaningful options. Farmers who buy John Deere tractors, which controls most of the tractor market, aren't permitted to fix their own equipment because the company requires farmers to use its repair services. (The practice is being challenged by a class-action lawsuit and a suit by the Federal Trade Commission.) Apple customers, similarly, are unable to repair their own phones, pushing them to buy new products rather than fix their current models. And in 2015, a study by Yale economist Zach Cooper found that costs for patients in hospitals without competition were approximately $1,900 higher than hospitals with four or more competitors.
    

        In recent years, we have entered a new era in which monopolistic companies ""crank up prices, crank down quality, service, and wages, and consumers have nowhere else to turn,"" says Marshall Steinbaum, an economist at the University of Utah.
    

        Americans are well aware of the problem. In a June Gallup poll of US adults, 41% of respondents said they had ""very little"" trust in ""big business,"" making it the third-least-trusted institution in America, behind only TV news and Congress. In a survey conducted this past spring, four in five respondents in rural areas of swing states agreed that ""corporate monopolies now run our entire economy."" And in a recent poll of registered voters, 41% of respondents under 30 said the killing of United Healthcare's CEO was ""acceptable"" or ""somewhat acceptable.""
    

        As shocking as that might be, we've been here before. At the end of the 19th century, as major trusts consolidated entire industries, Americans turned to violence. In 1877, in response to the railroads slashing wages, workers rose up in a massive general strike that left 100 people dead. In 1894, a railway strike against the Pullman Co. grew so heated that it sparked a pitched battle with the Illinois National Guard, which killed dozens of strikers. In 1920, a wagon full of explosives was parked on Wall Street to target the banker J.P. Morgan. The bombing killed more than 30 people and injured hundreds more.
    

        The question is: Why did the anti-corporate violence subside? What happened to tamp down the open rebellion — and why do so many Americans once again seem willing to embrace violence as a response to monopolization?
    

        Violence against monopolies dissipated for two reasons. The first was government regulation. The second was low prices.
    

        After the stock market crash of 1929, the government began to crack down on big corporations, breaking up monopolies in oil, tobacco, and railroads. At the same time, the New Deal enabled labor unions to fight companies on a more equal footing, with unions winning higher wages and better health insurance. Taken together, those efforts helped create a large and prosperous middle class. For decades, things seemed to be going well for regular Americans.
    

        Then, in the 1980s, the government shifted its philosophy toward antitrust enforcement. Rather than treating consolidation as an inherent evil, it adopted what became known as the ""consumer welfare"" standard. If companies kept their prices low, the thinking went, it didn't matter whether markets were cornered by a few corporations. No economic harm, no legal foul.
    

        The new philosophy allowed consolidation to soar — without sparking consumer unrest.
    

        As Walmart and Amazon began to dominate the economy, driving small shops out of business, Americans accepted the loss of local businesses and low wages in return for an abundance of cheap and convenient goods and services. Amazon might rule the world, but who cared? The prices were low, the deliveries were fast, and the returns were free.
    

        But now, as prices have shot up and companies have begun to take advantage of their market dominance, more and more Americans are realizing that when companies get too big, regular people end up paying the price. And when the system feels unfair, civility itself begins to crumble — especially when citizens feel they have no meaningful recourse. A sense of powerlessness, as history has repeatedly shown, breeds violence.
    

        Keeping things civil, in fact, was an explicit reason the government decided to rein in monopolies in the first place. Speaking on the floor of the Senate in 1890, Sen. John Sherman urged his fellow lawmakers, many of whom were beholden to the rail barons, to support the statute that became the foundation of the anti-monopoly movement: the Sherman Antitrust Act. Congress had to choose, Sherman said: Either heed the public's call to break up the monopolies or ""be ready for the socialist, the communist, and the nihilist."" Today, with trust in big business deeply eroded and public satisfaction in the healthcare system at a 24-year low, America may find itself at a similar crossroads.

4,2025-02-20,"While Android tablets are undoubtedly powerful and impressive these days, there was a time when buying a premium Android-powered slate meant that you didn’t have to sacrifice size and portability for performance. Fast-forward to today, and Apple’s iPad Mini line has pretty much dominated the premium compact tablet segment, with most Android brands opting to release low-end devices with smaller screen sizes.
That all changes though with Lenovo’s Legion Tab Gen 3 – a performance-packed device under the Legion gaming brand, the Legion Tab 3 provides Android users with a very capable alternative to the iPad Mini with impressive hardware. Powering the tablet is a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, which while not the latest is nevertheless impressive as far as overall performance is concerned. It’s partnered with 12GB of RAM, which these days is enough to run pretty much any game on the Google Play Store, including emulators as well.

READ: The iPad Mini 7 is Proof that We Need Good Compact Android Tablets
By comparison, other small Android tablets on the market right now come with rather basic specs, like Samsung’s Galaxy tab A9, Amazon’s Fire tablet lineup, and even Lenovo’s budget-friendly Tab M series. They’ll be enough for casual daily use, but they’re definitely not meant for performance outside media streaming or casual gaming.
In fact, the Legion Tab Gen 3 has apparently been selling rather well, with Lenovo struggling to keep up with buyer demand after selling out current stocks. With that in mind, some retailers still have kept the tablet in stock, although you have to be diligent when hunting one down.

Other specs include an 8.8-inch LCD display with a sharp 2,560 x 1,600 resolution and a 165Hz refresh rate, with a maximum brightness of 900 nits and slim bezels all around. There’s also a fairly-large 6,550 mAh battery, and connectivity is handled by a pair of USB-C ports for wired tech, in addition to WiFi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4. The tablet also features a 13MP main camera, and an 8MP selfie camera.
If you’re keen on grabbing what is probably the only premium-tier compact Android tablet on the market right now, then you can check it out using this link.

5,2025-02-20,"Kash Patel has been confirmed by the U.S. Senate as director of the FBI on Thursday in a vote of 51-49. The vote to confirm Patel was mostly along party lines, with all Democrats voting against it and Republican senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine also voting no.
Patel is a member of the board of Trump Media, the company that owns Donald Trump’s Truth Social, and recently received roughly $780,000 worth of stock in the company, according to regulatory filings reviewed by CNBC. The new FBI director is also a far-right extremist who has spread countless conspiracy theories related to QAnon and threatened to jail journalists.
Patel previously referred to those who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, as “political prisoners,” and was questioned during a confirmation hearing about his connections to something called the Jan 6 Prison Choir. President Trump granted full pardons to the people who violently stormed the Capitol.
Patel seems to believe in the QAnon conspiracy theory, a worldview that asserts the U.S. government and Hollywood are run by a cabal of pedophiles who perform child abuse rituals and drink the blood of kids for something called adrenochrome. And while sexual abuse is rampant in American society, adherents to the conspiracy theory believe all of this with a very ridiculous twist: That Donald Trump is going to save America’s children from these pedophiles.
QAnon was started after someone who claimed to be a government insider started posting on 4chan in late 2017 under the name Q, a reference to a high-level “Q” security clearance. Some posts were vague in the way that supposed psychics phrase things to convince clients they can tell the future. Other posts were more specific but could still be interpreted in several ways, as any holy text can.
Patel has denied promoting QAnon conspiracy theories, but his activity on social media tells a different story. One of Patel’s first posts on Truth Social after the platform launched in early 2022 was, “Having a beer with @q right now,” according to Wired.
Patel has promised to go after Trump’s political enemies, including people like Sen. Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California. Billionaire Elon Musk tweeted approvingly of Patel’s attacks on Schiff Thursday, tweeting “Adam Schiff is a criminal.” Musk leads DOGE, the group that’s currently dismantling the U.S. government in an oligarchic coup.
Adam Schiff is a criminal https://t.co/f2tbVUcsXg
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 20, 2025

Patel has also said he’ll go after journalists, though it’s not clear what steps he will take in the days and weeks ahead to do that. Speaking with Steve Bannon in late 2023, Patel insisted that people were lying about the attack on the U.S. Capitol.
“We will go out and find the conspirators, not just in government but in the media,” Patel told Bannon, according to Media Matters for America. “Yes, we’re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections.”
Patel wasn’t sure if he’d find a way to pursue civil or criminal penalties against members of the media.
“We’re going to come after you, whether it’s criminal or civilly, we’ll figure that out,” Patel continued. “But yeah, we’re putting you all on notice and Steve, this is why they hate us. This is why we’re tyrannical. This is why we’re dictators because we’re actually going to use the Constitution to prosecute them for crimes they said we have always been guilty of but never have.”
It’s a new era of American fascism and Patel’s confirmation as FBI Director feels like a starting gun. Stay safe out there, folks.

6,2025-02-20,"A new $50 million creator fund has been created for Horizon Worlds in conjunction with the launch of the desktop editor app.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Today, Meta announced that it is launching a new $50 million Creator Fund alongside the early access release of the Meta Horizon Worlds desktop editor. The fund aims to reward creators with cash prizes and a way to earn an income through Meta's Roblox-like game, including a new expansion to mobile that launched last Fall in the Meta Horizon app on iOS and Android.

In his weekly column, Android Central Senior Content Producer Nick Sutrich delves into all things VR, from new hardware to new games, upcoming technologies, and so much more.
Meta says the new fund is designed to appeal to a growing audience of players who prefer free-to-play content, similar to audiences on other mobile platforms. Meta's blog post on the announcement says the new move is aimed to grow these mobile, non-VR audiences by reaching ""a lot of new people who don’t yet own a Quest headset and ultimately grow the pie for everyone.""
The logic, Meta dictates, is that people who enjoy Horizon Worlds will be more inclined to purchase a Meta Quest headset to try the experiences in VR. But Meta couldn't be more wrong here, and while I ultimately think hybrid experiences like this — that means VR and non-VR players can game with each other — are the future of gaming as a whole, Meta's focus on Horizon Worlds is simply unhealthy for everyone.
Meta's CTO recently said that 2025 would be the make-or-break year for Horizon Worlds, so while it's not surprising to see the company make a last-ditch effort to catalyze better development for Horizon Worlds, it's beyond frustrating to see the company continue to push the Roblox-like platform over the best Meta Quest games at the expense of existing VR developers.

The first thing you see when opening the required Meta Quest companion app isn't the best games on the platform. It's janky free-to-play garbage that's an instant turn-off to anyone who isn't 8 years old, and that's a huge problem.
Once upon a time, I fully believed that Meta Horizon Worlds could co-exist with more premium experiences like Batman Arkham Shadow. Other platforms seem to have no problem juggling the balance between offering free-to-play and premium experiences to users who prefer one over the other, but Meta has shown that it's not very good at multitasking.
Instead, a quick visit to the Meta Horizon app on your phone always shows a ton of Horizon Worlds content that you may or may not want. The premium app store can be found by clicking a tiny icon on the top left of the app, and promotional content for these kinds of experiences has substantially waned over the past six months.
This huge shift in focus for Meta has had a profound impact on the VR industry, as a whole. Instead of developers seeing record game sales after the launch of a new headset, the Meta Quest 3S launch was decidedly different. Many VR developers saw flat or even lower sales throughout the Holiday 2024 period when compared to 2023, and the results haven't been pretty.

Meta's choice to promote Horizon Worlds content over paid apps from developers is causing unnecessary and irreparable harm to the VR market as a whole.
Lots of video game developers have closed their doors or made substantial layoffs this year. While this unfortunate reality isn't relegated just to the VR market, it hurts more in VR because there aren't as many bigger developers as on traditional consoles or PC. Just in the last month alone, we've seen major layoffs at Toast Interactive, Crytek, Fast Travel Games, Soul Assembly, and even the app market SideQuest.
Wider industry trends are somewhat to blame for these problems, but Meta's choice to promote Horizon Worlds content over paid apps from developers is causing unnecessary and irreparable harm to the VR market as a whole.
I had already planned to write this post before I found out about Meta's new creator program, and its existence only further solidifies my opinion here. The first thing you see when opening the required Meta Quest companion app isn't the best games on the platform. It's janky free-to-play garbage that's an instant turn-off to anyone who isn't 8 years old, and that's a huge problem.

Meta, it's time to give up the ghost. Horizon Worlds isn't going to be The Oasis from Ready Player One. It's not even going to be Rec Room or VR Chat, two very successful VR ""metaverse-style"" experiences that existed far before Horizon Worlds was ever a twinkle in Mark Zuckerberg's eye.
Mr. Zuckerberg, if you're reading this, it's OK to accept Horizon Worlds as a ""failure"" to capitalize early enough on a growing trend. So instead of tanking the successful Quest ecosystem and its development community, focus on the best experiences available on the platform and start promoting those, instead.
With the VP of VR on the way out at the end of the month, this is the perfect time for his replacement to focus on the real metaverse of apps and games that Quest players know and love. Get back to that early 2024 time frame when developers were seeing huge growth and success in their titles with the swath of new players. The Quest 3S just broke sales records, and that should translate into game sales. This fixation on Horizon Worlds could kill off the VR ecosystem you've spent years building up and no one wants that.

9,2025-02-20,"Ne Zha 2, a new Chinese animated movie, has brought in $1.7 billion at the box office and dethroned Pixar’s Inside Out 2 to become the highest-grossing animated flick in history.
Released in January, Ne Zha 2 has been on a record-breaking run in China.  Earlier this month the animated sequel became the first movie in history to cross $1 billon at the box office in a single market. The movie is currently only showing in mainland China and hasn’t been released internationally. It is also the first non-Hollywood movie to make more than $1 billion in ticket sales. And now it can add “Top-Grossing Animated Movie” to its growing list of records. 
As reported by Deadline on February 20, Ne Zha 2 has now made ¥12.47 billion ($1.72 billion USD) at the box office in China since hitting theaters on January 29. That not only beats previous animated box-office champ Inside Out 2, but it also places Ne Zha 2 at number eight on the list of overall highest-grossing movies in history, above blockbuster hits like Top Gun: Maverick, Jurassic World, and The Avengers. The animated blockbuster, a sequel to 2019's Ne Zha, is now projected to gross $2.08 billion in China. That would put it at number five on the highest grossers list, beating out Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Avengers: Infinity War.
If Ne Zha 2—an animated movie based on the 16th-century Chinese novel Investiture of the Gods—can reach $2 billion, it will make history as the first movie to ever do so in a single market. It would also be one of only seven films to achieve $2 billion at the box office.
Due to the film’s continued success, Ne Zha 2 will be sticking around in theaters for a bit longer. The movie has been given an extended run in China and will stay in theaters until March 30. It is set to release in Hong Kong later this week.

12,2025-02-20,"A random person in a public place has a horrible vision. He or she sees into the future and realizes that they and everyone around them is about to die. So they take action, saving a large group of people in the process. It should be good news, but they were supposed to die, so Death comes for each survivor, leaving none alive by the end.
That’s the basic setup of all the films in the Final Destination franchise, a five-film horror series that began in 2000 and ran through 2011. This summer though, 14 years later, it’s back with Final Destination: Bloodlines and that’s our cue to take action.
We recently revisited the first five Final Destination films (all of which are streaming on Max) and decided which is worst, which is best, and everything in between.
Oof. Just a big, colossal oof. The Final Destination, the fourth film in the franchise, is the 3D entry and it’s almost as if nothing else was important. You get the sense every decision in the film was based on how it would look in 3D. That’s the only possible reason why so many terrible decisions are made. The survivors are way more randomized than the rest of the films, which creates a huge disconnect with the audience. Then, the ones who are friends are mostly unlikeable or flat. The kills are never quite as elaborate or interesting as they usually are and even the big, inciting incident itself, the stock car accident, doesn’t have the devilish flow of the other films. Most of the Final Destination films are bad, but this is the worst.
The film that follows the original should, hypothetically, share more than a sliver of DNA with its sequel. Final Destination 2 brings back Ali Larter but that’s the only good thing about it. It kills Devon Sawa off-screen, the survivors are completely random, which changes the flavor of the story entirely, and it assumes you know everything about it so it moves way too fast from kill to kill. Some of the deaths are solid but it’s an incredibly weak film that instantly sets a low bar for its follow-ups.
In reality, the second, third, and fourth Final Destination films are all incredibly bad. The margins between them are so close that really any of the three films in any of the three slots would be understandable. Often then, just comes down to personal preference and in the case of Final Destination 3, it has a few things going for it the second and fourth films don’t. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is the star, for one, which helps because she’s highly likable unlike most of the other leads. Also, a roller coaster accident is simply more innovative, believable, and terrifying than a car accident, which happens in both other films.
Surprise! You didn’t expect that, did you? Basically, when it comes to the Final Destination films so far, there are two good ones and three bad ones. The gap is massive between those groupings but, within the groupings, it’s quite close. We’ll get into the best one in a second but this film, the original, has several things that set it above. For one, because it’s the first, it’s forced to set up and deal with the actual premise of the franchise. That, in turn, gives you more time with the characters and makes you care more about their deaths. It also has, by far, the best cast of the series, which includes not just Sawa and Larter, but Kerr Smith and Seann William Scott. Then, all of those characters have pre-existing relationships which creates bigger emotions. Watching it right along with its sequels, the original just feels better and fresh. And yet…
It’s not often that the fifth film in a franchise is its best but, in this case, we think it’s fair. For starters, unlike every other film in the franchise save for the first one, Final Destination 5 makes sure all the victims have something in commonâthey work together. That means they share feelings, traumas, and other personal dynamics that are brought in too, which raises the tension. Most importantly though, just when you are ready to write the film off as a simple, solid sequel, it hits you with the only surprise ending of the franchise. You’ve actually been watching a prequel that crosses over with the original film in a super fun way. The choice not only sets it apart, it elevates the movie above the rest. Finally, someone making one of these sequels had an original, cool idea.
Set for release on May 16, we have high hopes for the sixth film in the franchise. After a nearly 15-year hiatus, and coming from a pair of filmmakers (Zach Lipovsky and Adam Stein) who love to innovate, all the potential is there. Plus there’s that title: “Bloodlines.” There aren’t many, if any, characters alive from the previous films. Will there be DNA with the other films? We hope so.

Note, youâll still need to cough up the $1,000 or $2,000 to own Nvidiaâs top-of-the-line Blackwell cards, but this may be the only way some PC gamers may hope to grab one at the base price.
Nvidiaâs program isÂ similar to what other OEMs have landed on, specificallyÂ Zotac, with its Discord-based raffle to let users buy a card at MSRPÂ rather than at a markup. Other AIM cards from Asus and MSI have increased in price by upwards of 18% since the RTX 5090 launch in January. The r/nvidia subreddit has continued to record 5090 prices jumping by $300 to $400. The MSRP RTX 5080 16G Ventus 3X from MSI went from $1,000 to $1,139. Meanwhile, MSIâs RTX 5090 32G Vanguard SOC Launch Edition jumped by $310 to $2,689. Meanwhile, resellers pawn these same GPUs on eBay for over $4,000. Some OC models are running for close to or over $6,000.
The direct-to-consumer model shouldnât be the first way companies should think to beat scalpers. Because manufacturers canât control the wide breadth of online retailers, the best way to avoid price gouging is to have enough stock that scalpers canât purchase all of them. Nvidia was warning about low stock values even before launch, and physical retailers found they only had a paltry number of GPUs to sell to customers. When Nvidia launched the RTX 5090 on Jan. 30, online stock sold out in less than 30 minutes.
Feb. 20 marks the launch of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, a card we thought was solid at $750 for 4K gaming. Then again, youâd be lucky to find it for $750. Weâre already seeing certain markets planning to sell non-OC cards for over $900 and some OC variants for over $1,000. At that price, you may as well wait to buy the RTX 5080 (as if it’s even possible to purchase that card at MSRP). Weâll update this story if the stock situation for that card is as dire as the cardâs more powerful siblings. Nvidia already pushed the launch of the RTX 5070 back to March 5.
For its part, Nvidia shared multiple links with Gizmodo for stock-clocked 5070 Ti cards at MSRP before the launch date.Â However, checkingÂ allÂ thoseÂ links now lists the cards as out of stock at the time of publication.Â This situation is not tenable, and even if Nvidia launches another priority access scheme for the 5070 family, it wonât be enough to meet the overall demand. We donât suggest anybody buy a card for $600 to $3,000 above MSRP, no matter how many frames you think youâll get in Cyberpunk 2077.

          The Asus Prime RTX 5070 Ti can perform at around the RTX 4080 Super. Sounds like a good deal? Just be aware you probably won't get it for $750.
        

          Nvidia pushed the $550 RTX 5070 release back to March, giving AMD time to reveal its Radeon RX 9070 GPUs.
        

          The Nvidia RTX 5090 and 5080 are near-sold out, but Zotac is simply selling directly to consumers through Discord.

15,2025-02-20,"Ah yes, the city of dreams. If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere! But, seriously, if you don't come from some sort of privilege and you decide to move to NYC tomorrow, it would be very very difficult for you. I moved here many years ago when rent was closer to $700, but now… Pffffffft, fahgettaboutit! Seriously, I was already struggling as a person trying to make it on their own even with that ""cheap"" rent. (I know, someone who isn't a nepo-baby moved to NYC, impossible!) Even that being said, I still had more privileged than many others who try to move here—I had a college education and friends/family who always knew someone who knew someone in NYC that could help me out with some weird under the table gig to help me make rent. So, though I survived off of a can of peanut butter for months and the free cheese puffs at the bars, I was still cruising. But now, I fully believe if I had moved to NYC today in the same way, I would not be able to afford rent. Unless I lived in a questionably legal artist complex deep in Brownsville, that has like 5 people to a room, I would definitely fail. 
 
Rent has always been a contentious point for New Yorkers—the landlords and brokers want more money and the renters just want to be able to afford an actual functioning roof over their heads while they try to chase their dreams. And don't even get me started on the children of the wealthy parents coming in and not caring for either side…

New York is working on a law that bans broker fees for renters. If you have never rented in NYC: Brokers are the people who unlock the door of the apartment for you to go view it. For the past several years, they've been charging a percentage of a YEAR'S worth of rent to the potential renters. Sometimes that fee can be $4k-$6k. It's insane. Hopefully, this summer a law passes that bans that and the only people who have to pay the brokers are the people who actually hire them. 
 
That being said, New Yorkers are used to being teased with these kind of renter laws, just for their hope to get lost within the courts. It's exhausting. So, some have turned to Reddit to vent and share their frustration with it all. See the most annoying experience with brokers and landlords below!

I was a big fan of the OPPO Find N3, so when I heard rumors that OPPO might be exiting the foldable market, I was disappointed. That’s also why I was excited when I received the news that OPPO is indeed launching a new book-style foldable phone. What I liked about the Find N3 was that its camera performance didn’t feel like a compromise, something that was not always the case with many foldable phones when the Find N3 was released. While having a powerful imaging system on a foldable phone means dealing with a sizable camera bump, it was a trade-off I was happy to live with.
The foldable phone landscape varies significantly across regions. While US consumers are limited to Samsung, Google, and OnePlus, international markets enjoy a more diverse selection, with brands like Xiaomi, Vivo, Huawei, and others competing to deliver increasingly sophisticated foldable devices. Now, roughly 15 months after the Find N3’s debut, OPPO has unveiled the Find N5, pushing boundaries once again.
Designer: OPPO
The Find N5 brings a lot to the table. It’s the world’s thinnest book-style foldable, the first foldable powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and the first foldable certified with IPX6, IPX8, and IPX9 ratings. As a longtime admirer of the Find N3 Fold, I approached the Find N5 with high expectations. Let’s see how it stacks up.
We are at a time when flagship smartphones are moving away from large camera bumps, and the OPPO Find N5 makes a bold yet elegant statement. The camera island has been thoughtfully redesigned, achieving a 20% reduction in thickness compared to its predecessor while retaining OPPO’s distinctive Cosmos Ring design. This refined approach creates a more sophisticated profile that aligns with the phone’s premium positioning.

The Find N5’s design philosophy emphasizes clean lines and minimal ornamentation, yet manages to maintain visual interest through careful material selection and finish details. Available in two colorways, each variant offers a unique aesthetic appeal. The Cosmic Black variant features a sophisticated matte back panel that evokes a deep, mysterious appearance resembling frosted glass. Its matte gray frame creates a seamless, monolithic appearance that exudes understated luxury.






The Misty White variant, on the other hand, incorporates nano-lithography technology to create an ethereal, constantly shifting pattern across its back panel. This finish catches and plays with light in subtle ways, creating an almost ethereal effect as you move the device. The silver frame provides a striking contrast that highlights the phone’s premium construction while adding a touch of brightness to the overall design.






Both colorways share a similar textured back that delivers an exceptionally refined tactile experience. The surface treatment not only provides a pleasant silky touch but also helps minimize fingerprints and smudges, maintaining the phone’s pristine appearance during daily use.
The Oppo Find N5 claims the title of the world’s thinnest book-style foldable, measuring just 4.21mm when unfolded and 8.93mm when folded. The phone’s dimensions are 160.87mm x 145.58mm x 4.21mm when unfolded, and 160.87mm x 74.42mm x 8.93mm when folded. The Find N5 boasts more than just thinness; it’s also very light, weighing only 229g. To put it in perspective, that is only 6.8mm thicker and 2g heavier than the iPhone 16 Pro Max.

Despite its slim profile, the device feels robust and well-engineered. Holding the folded Find N5 feels almost like holding a slab phone, and it fits comfortably in your palm or pocket. Oppo revisited almost every componentfrom the motherboard to the USB-C port, the hinge, and the frameto achieve this balance of thinness, lightness, and durability.
Another impressive feature of this phone is the crease, or rather, the lack of one. It’s barely noticeable both visually and tactically. You wouldn’t notice the crease unless you look at it from a certain angle. What’s even more remarkable is that you hardly feel it when you run your finger across it, both in terms of width and depth. The Find N3 already had a very subtle crease, but the Find N5 takes it to the next level, with a crease that is 10% narrower and 50% shallower. It has the most deceptive crease of any foldable phone I’ve ever tried.

The hinge feels consistent throughout its range of motion. Unlike the inconsistent hinge of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 or the more effort-demanding hinge of the Pixel Fold, opening and closing the N5 feels smooth and fluid. Unfortunately, the Find N5’s hinge isn’t as steady when the phone is opened at a wider angle. There were a few occasions when the phone slowly opened flat while I was watching a video with the phone at about a 95 to 100-degree angle.






Another thing to note is the position of the volume rocker: it’s too high. You’ll need to shift your palm or hold the phone with two hands to reach it. Also, when I hold the phone open, with my pinky finger supporting most of the weight, it digs into my pinky. But this probably has to do with the position of my pinky, as I tend to support the phone with the side of my pinky near the nail. If I support it with the pad of my pinky, it’s not an issue.

Display quality stands as one of the Find N5’s strongest features. The outer 6.62-inch OLED screen (2616 x 1140 resolution, 431 PPI) delivers impressive brightness up to 1600 nits outdoors. The inner 8.12-inch OLED display (2248 x 2480 resolution, 412 PPI) reaches 1400 nits of outdoor. Both screens feature adaptive 1-120Hz refresh rates with LTPO technology and support HDR10+ and Dolby Vision. The outer display’s 20.7:9 aspect ratio provides a familiar smartphone experience, while the inner screen’s 9.9:9 ratio creates an immersive viewing canvas. The transition between displays is seamless, enhancing the overall user experience.

The Find N5 features stereo speakers, but they are only located on the outer screen side. This design choice reduces the immersive experience, as you’ll notice the sound coming from just one side of the phone when watching content with the phone unfolded.



Powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, the Find N5 handles multitasking and intensive workloads effortlessly, maintaining cool temperatures even under pressure. Find N5 runs ColorOS15.0.1 based on Android 15. The improved Boundless View makes multitasking, switching between apps, copy and paste easy and seamless. Find N5 further enhances productivity through various AI features, including AI Document for translation and summarization, and AI Call Summary for transcribing audio conversations.



One of the standout features is O+ Connect for Mac, which builds upon OPPO’s existing file transfer capabilities between OPPO devices and iOS and iPadOS. This new functionality enables remote Mac control through the Find N5, though it requires the O+ Connect application to be installed on your Mac. The device also supports the OPPO Pen, adding another layer of productivity and creativity. However, testing this feature wasn’t possible during the review period, as I was unable to acquire the OPPO Pen.




The Find N5’s imaging system builds upon OPPO and Hasselblad’s photography expertise, featuring a triple-camera array. The 50MP main camera shares the same Sony LYT-700 sensor (1/1.56-inch, f/1.89) with Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) as the Find X8, delivering excellent results in both daylight and low-light conditions. Images show impressive sharpness, accurate white balance, and strong dynamic range.





Accompanying the main sensor is a 50MP telephoto camera (1/2.75-inch sensor, f/2.7) with OIS, offering 3x optical zoom and 6x lossless zoom capabilities. While the camera technically supports up to 120x zoom, image quality deteriorates significantly beyond 6x. The telephoto lens doubles as a capable macro shooter with a 10cm focal length.
The 8MP ultra-wide camera (15mm-equivalent, 116-degree field-of-view, f/2.2) proves to be the system’s weak point, particularly in challenging lighting conditions. This limitation is especially disappointing given the foldable form factor’s unique advantage for selfie composition using the outer display as a viewfinder.





Video capabilities include 4K 60fps recording on both main and telephoto cameras, while the ultra-wide is limited to 4K 30fps. Camera switching during video recording is possible but lacks smoothness in transition.
OPPO has managed to pack an impressive 5600mAh battery into the Find N5’s slim frame, complemented by robust charging capabilities. The device supports 80W SuperVOOC wired charging and 50W AirVOOC wireless charging, ensuring quick power replenishment when needed. Battery performance is particularly noteworthy given the device’s form factor. The Find N5 easily handles a full day of heavy usage, including extended periods of content consumption on the larger inner display and intensive camera use. This endurance is especially impressive considering the power demands of the big inner screen.



One of the concerns many people have when it comes to foldable phones is durability. The hinge is the essential element of a foldable phone, forming the foundation of its structural integrity and ensuring its overall durability. The hinge of Find N5 is crafted from aerospace-standard Grad 5 titanium alloy and utilizes advanced 3D printing technology to achieve precision and strength. 
Just like the hinge, the inner screen is subjected to the physical stress of opening and closing. To address this, N5 uses what it calls a Dual Shielded Flexible Screen. This technology employs an ultra-thin stainless steel plate, ultra-thing glass, and an exclusive anti-shock film, making Find N5 70% more shock-resistant compared to the previous generation, according to Oppo.

The other worry that comes with a foldable phone is its vulnerability to water. Luckly Find N5 is IPX6, IPX8, and IPX9-rated, which means it can withstand submersion and high-pressure, high temperature. While it does not have an official rating for dust protection, protection against extreme water conditions gives you peace of mind whether you are caught in the rain or accidentally drop the phone into water.
As for the update, Find N5 will get 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of security updates. This is pretty much the industry standard when it comes to software support, so it’s reassuring that OPPO isn’t cutting corners here. Improving the phone’s longevity plays an important role in reducing its negative impact on the environment as time goes by.
The OPPO Find N5 is a remarkable device, showcasing cutting-edge foldable smartphone technology. Its engineering achievementssuch as its thin profile, innovative hinge, and durabilityposition it as a premium option in the foldable space. You’d be hard-pressed to find such a potent laundry list of desirable bullet points in a single device.

While its retail price and market availability will play significant roles in determining its value, the combination of advanced features, productivity tools, and exceptional build quality makes the Find N5 a strong contender in the high-end foldable market. If you’re looking for a blend of portability, build quality, productivity, and camera performance, the Find N5 delivers a compelling package.
The OPPO Find N5 represents a refined approach to foldable smartphone design, addressing many common issues associated with the form factor. OPPO has delivered a well-polished device that’s practical for everyday use, with features like its slim profile, near-invisible crease, and water resistance.
Its standout achievements include impressive camera performance, seamless display transitions, and a solid balance between portability and battery life. The integration of productivity features like O+ Connect for Mac and AI tools further elevates its utility.
The OPPO Find N5 stands out in the growing foldable market, offering an impressive package for those seeking a high-end, versatile, and reliable foldable smartphone. As foldables continue to mature, the Find N5 suggests that OPPO is leading the charge in refining this exciting technology.

The RTX 5070 Ti is now available, but just like the 5080 and 5090, it's difficult to find one in stock at major retailers.
By 
    Brendan Hesse
   on February 20, 2025 at 11:00AM PST
Nvidia's lineup of GeForce RTX 50-Series Graphics Cards expanded this week with the arrival of the 5070 Ti, which joins the higher-end 5080 and 5090 models that launched late last month. Just like those two GPUs, the 5070 Ti is hard to find in stock at Amazon, Best Buy, Newegg, and other retailers. We'd recommend checking the links below, as restocks tend to be sporadic and rather unpredictable. The standard 5070 GPU is expected to release before the end of February, too.
The flagship card, the RTX 5090, is priced at $2,000, and Nvidia claims it's twice as powerful as the RTX 4090 but requires a 1,000-watt power supply--a huge leap from the RTX 4090's 450W baseline power draw. Despite its power demands, the RTX 5090 is more compact than its predecessor, fitting into smaller PC builds.
The slimmer size and higher performance are true of all the cards in the lineup, with Nvidia claiming the $1,000 RTX 5080 to be twice as fast as the RTX 4080. The budget-priced $550 RTX 5070 offers performance comparable to the RTX 4090, at nearly a third of the price. The 5070 Ti, meanwhile, sits between the 5070 and 5080 in terms of price ($750) and performance.
Rather than relying on pure processing power to achieve these benchmarks, the new 50-Series cards leverage Nvidia's latest machine learning technology, including RTX Neural Shaders and the latest DLSS 4 upscaling. Not only does DLSS 4 allow for upscaling lower-resolution gameplay to 1440p or 4K resolutions, it also includes Multi Frame Generation, which Nvidia says is capable of generating up to three additional frames for every one frame of rendered gameplay. It's essentially doing for gaming what frame smoothing does for movies and TVs and creating the appearance of higher, smoother frame rates without the hardware actually rendering them all.
So, while the 50-Series GPUs' actual hardware performance uplift is technically lower in terms of raw processing power without the aid of AI technology--the 5070 has less processing power than the 4090, for instance--it also means the GPUs are smaller and more affordable compared to their previous-gen counterparts since you don't need as much horsepower to achieve high-end results.
Of course, AI upscaling and frame generation have tradeoffs compared to rendering everything with hardware. These machine learning technologies can potentially match hardware rendering the quantity of performance, but the issue is the quality of that performance. Upscalers like DLSS, AMD's FSR, and Sony's PSSR on PS5 Pro can be inconsistent (or even incorrect, in extreme cases), while frame generation can introduce noticeable input delay--something that playing at high frame rates is intended to alleviate, not exacerbate.
To be fair, these are issues Nvidia--and game developers--are aware of and actively working to address. Besides, plenty of games already utilize the features to great results, and the 40-series cards used DLSS to achieve big performance gains over the 30-series--unfortunately, it was also incredibly expensive. If the next generation of the technology works as intended, the 5090 could enable another massive performance boost, while the mid-range RTX 50 GPUs could offer a much more affordable option for achieving 4K resolution gameplay and high FPS.
RTX 50-Series laptop GPUs are on the way as well, with the first models expected to launch in March.

19,2025-02-20,"Despite reporting strong results for its latest fiscal year, Walmart’s (WMT+0.80%) stock sank in early trading on Thursday after the retailer issued conservative guidance for its upcoming year.
Bentonville, Arkansas-based Walmart forecasted its annual sales for its fiscal year ending in January 2026 to increase between 3% and 4%, slightly below analysts’ expectations, with adjusted operating income growing between 3.5% and 5.5%. That guidance includes headwinds stemming from Walmart’s $2.3 billion acquisition of TV manufacturer Vizio, which was finalized in December, and because 2024 was a leap year. 
The company’s guidance does not account for a few factors, including President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which may push retailers to raise their prices. During an earnings call, CEO Doug McMillon said that tariffs are something the company has managed before, and that “we’re wired to try and save people money, so that will be our ultimate goal.” 
Although Walmart usually issues more conservative guidance, the company has raised investors’ expectations after delivering its best performance since 1998.
Shares fell as much as 8% in pre-market trading before losses were pared back to a 5% decrease. Those losses pale in comparison to the stock’s massive gains over the last year, which come out to about 72%.
Walmart said same-store sales for its U.S. division grew 4.6% last quarter, bolstered by the company’s ability to attract high-income households, while its -e-commerce business notched a 20% increase in sales. Revenue for the period increased by 4.1% to $180.6 billion, slightly above analysts’ consensus, according to estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+0.16%). Adjusted earnings per share came in at 66 cents, just above expectations for 65 cents.
For the full-year, revenue grew 5.1% to $681 billion, the company said, while operating income rose by 8.6% to $2.3 billion. 
“We have momentum driven by our low prices, a growing assortment, and an eCommerce business driven by faster delivery times,” McMillon said in a statement. “We’ll stay focused on growth, improving operating margins, and strengthening [return on investment] as we invest to serve our customers and members even better.”
Walmart said Thursday it would raise its annual cash dividend for its last fiscal year by 13% to 94 cents per share, marking its largest increase in more than a decade. The company has raised the annual dividend for 52 years in a row, CFO John David Rainey said in a statement.

20,2025-02-20,"TrendForce has indicated that global shipments of LCD gaming monitor panels with a refresh rate greater than 144 Hz will likely see slower growth in 2025 than in prior years.
The research group expects panels to ship at a rate of less than 5% in 2025, with approximately 34 million units moved. In comparison, global LCD gaming monitor panel shipments reached 32.42 million units in 2024, hitting a 12% year-over-year increase.
TrendForce noted there were several aspects taking place in the LCD gaming monitor market in prior years that likely won’t be repeated in 2025. Chinese panel makers were especially focused on manufacturing and expanding the market. Anticipation over various video games and eSports tournaments encouraged panel makers’ demand, particularly in China. The game Black Myth: Wukong was released in mid-2024, while the Hangzhou Asian Games took place in mid-2023– which can be akin to an Olympic Games for eSports.
These events propelled spending on gaming monitors in the prior timeframe. Panel makers that benefitted from these events included HKC, which saw 50% year-over-year shipment increases in 2024, CSOT which saw a 40% increase, and BOE, which saw a 20% increase. However, there isn’t anything happening in the industry currently that would aid in driving the market for 2025.
TrendForce also noted that LCD gaming monitor panels with a refresh rate of 165 Hz have become more mainstream and are seeing heavy price competition. This is leading panel makers to opt away from producing this form factor, hence the slowed growth.
Meanwhile, the OLED gaming monitor panel industry remains robust and continues to grow at an expansive rate. Global shipments spiked 132% year-over-year in 2024 and is expected to grow a moderate 40% in 2025. This part of the industry has seen a trend of 27-inch and 31.5-inch OLED gaming monitors of varying resolutions and refresh rates. Samsung Display has the market and has set the prices of panels to its benefit, which increased shipment volumes.
TrendForce indicated that while the OLED gaming monitor industry is still relatively new and developmental, new players could be seen investing in 2025. They will likely focus on the high-end options, meaning price reductions won’t come any time soon.
Ahead of CES 2025, Samsung has announced its first OLED monitor not explicitly targeted at PC gamers. The Smart Monitor M90SF has an OLED -- a first for these devices -- bringing the love from the Odyssey gaming line more toward the mainstream demographic. It's a big deal for those hoping to engage in HDR content, both in terms of creating it and consuming it.
It makes sense, too, as the Smart Monitor M9 is built to be an entertainment hub. Like previous models, such as the Smart Monitor M80B, the M9 doesn't require being connected to a PC to run content on it -- like a little television right on your desk. It has Samsung TV Plus, Samsung Game Hub, and pretty much every streaming app you could want -- along with a remote for convenient controls.
One of the biggest criticisms leveled against OLED monitors, despite being some of the best gaming monitors you can buy, is how dim they are. Although brightness is steadily increasing, it looks like the next crop of OLED gaming monitors will make quite the leap when it comes to HDR performance. Ahead of CES 2025, VESA has revealed a new tier of its DisplayHDR standard that's focused squarely on the brightness of OLED monitors.
The certification is DisplayHDR True Black 1,000. Most OLED gaming monitors, such as the MSI MPG 321URX or Alienware 27 QD-OLED, are certified with DisplayHDR True Black 400. This certification level is reserved for OLED -- or extremely high-end mini-LED -- displays that achieve nearly perfect black levels. According to VESA's specifications, the display has to reach 0.0005 nits with a checkboard pattern. Now, VESA is focusing on the other end of the spectrum, adding a more demanding tier that maintains those low black levels while pushing brightness higher.
Ahead of CES 2025, LG has announced new extra-large additions to its line of UltraGear GX9 OLED gaming monitors: one being a massive, 45-inch display with a bendable panel, and the other, a 39-inch ""smart"" gaming monitor with webOS built-in.
Let's start with the big boy, though, because it has an impressive ""world's first"" designation behind it. It's the first 5K OLED monitor on the market, featuring a resolution of 5120 x 2160 -- also known as 5K2K. Not only is it the first OLED monitor in general to have a 5K resolution but it's also the first gaming monitor to launch with this higher resolution, normally reserved for high-end creator monitors like the Apple Studio Display.

22,2025-02-20,"Nvidia’s latest 50-series graphics card has arrived and is going fast.
by  Alice Jovanée
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.
The Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti is the most affordable (and available) entry point to Nvidia’s Blackwell series of graphics cards, at least until the standard RTX 5070 arrives on March 5. The 5070 Ti delivers 16 GB of GDDR7 memory at speeds rivaling the RTX 4080 Super, but at a more approachable price point, and with DLSS 4 to offer superior ray-tracing performance.
The RTX 5070 Ti is listed with a price tag of $749, but some third-party models, like those made by Asus or Gigabyte, can cost significantly more. At MSRP, the RTX 5070 Ti is solid value, especially when you consider many previous-generation GPUs are either out of stock or overpriced. However, if you’re considering paying upwards of $1,000 for a 50-series GPU, you might want to weigh your options more carefully.
If you’ve made up your mind and are ready to invest in a new graphics card, we’ve collected the various third-party models listed at online retailers, all sorted by manufacturer. Don’t dwell on it too long, though; as with previous GPU launches, supplies are going to sell out fast.

What this means: On a weekly basis, Realtor.com reports the year-over-year change in active inventory and new listings.  On a monthly basis, they report total inventory.  For January, Realtor.com reported inventory was up 24.6% YoY, but still down 24.8% compared to the 2017 to 2019 same month levels.  Now - on a weekly basis - inventory is up 27.6% YoY.

Realtor.com has monthly and weekly data on the existing home market. Here is their weekly report: Weekly Housing Trends View—Data for Week Ending Feb. 15, 2025• Active inventory increased, with for-sale homes 27.6% above year-ago levels

For the 67th consecutive week, the number of homes for sale has increased compared with the same time last year. This week also marked the sixth straight week where the growth rate has increased, fueled by the entrance of many new listings on the market. 
  
• New listings—a measure of sellers putting homes up for sale—increased 5%

Newly listed inventory increased year over year for the sixth week in a row, as sellers go online for the spring buying season. Despite mortgage rates remaining stubbornly high and many prospective sellers feeling the lock-in effect due to their lower previous rates, new homes are hitting the market at a faster pace than in 2024 at this time.Here is a graph of the year-over-year change in inventory according to realtor.com. 
Inventory was up year-over-year for the 67th consecutive week.  New listings have jumped recently but remain below typical pre-pandemic levels.

25,2025-02-20,"Launch day saw practically every RTX 5070 Ti GPU sell out immediately, but you aren't totally out of luck. I found some pre-built PCs with the new ""Blackwell"" GPU inside.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Pre-built desktop PCs with the RTX 5070 Ti GPU inside might be your best way to get the new hardware. NVIDIA's mid-range 5070 Ti launched on February 20 at 9 AM EST, and, as expected, individual cards sold out almost immediately. It's the same situation I saw with the RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 launch, with limited availability and scalpers sucking up a lot of the hardware that did make it to retail outlets.
You're not alone if you didn't manage to snag a standalone RTX 5070 Ti on launch day (or the days following), and I have an alternate solution. Pre-built gaming PCs might not be exactly what you were looking for, but they generally stay in stock longer and offer a better chance of getting the new GPU sooner rather than later.
I found some pre-built RTX 5070 Ti PCs worth sharing on launch day, and I'll keep the list updated as more options become available.
February 21, 2025: I added a few more RTX 5070 Ti pre-built desktop PCs that became available overnight. — Cale Hunt
Most of these pre-built PCs launched alongside the standalone RTX 5070 Ti GPUs, but some are still listed as ""Coming soon."" I've been sure to note availability for each PC, and you can click through to check it out even if it's not yet ready to sell.

NVIDIA launched its RTX 5070 Ti GPU on February 20, 2025 at 9 AM EST / 3 PM CET. As expected, standalone cards sold out immediately after launch. I'm keeping an eye on RTX 5070 Ti availability to hopefully help you get the right hardware for your needs and budget.
Building your own PC is almost always cheaper than buying a pre-built, but you can't discount the convenience and availability of a ready-made PC. PC builders also have easier access to hardware, meaning the scant selection of standalone RTX 5000 GPUs isn't your only avenue. 
There are lots of pre-built PCs that use as many standard parts as possible, ignoring the more proprietary setups from builders like Dell, HP, and Lenovo. This makes them feel like they were built at home rather than in a factory. Just as long as you understand the perks and cons of a pre-built system, buying one might be the only way to get your hands on an RTX 5070 Ti anytime soon.
Reviews for the RTX 5070 Ti haven't exactly been glowingly positive. Even if you do find an RTX 5070 Ti in stock, whether or not it makes sense for you ultimately comes down to what you're currently using in your PC.
With testing and benchmarks showing minimal performance gains compared to the RTX 4070 Ti Super and roughly 15% worse performance than an RTX 5080, the RTX 5070 Ti isn't exactly a great upgrade if you already have an NVIDIA 40-series card. 
I might be saying something different if NVIDIA's $749 MSRP was actually being observed by a majority of the GPUs. Since there's no Founders Edition of the RTX 5070 Ti, you're basically paying whatever third-party custom builders want to charge. And in some cases, you'll pay more for an RTX 5070 Ti than for an RTX 5080 FE.
My advice? Consider the RTX 5070 Ti if you're still using an older NVIDIA or AMD card. Have a 30-series GPU? The 5070 Ti will seem like a big step up. I'm still working with an AMD Radeon RX 6800, and the jump to an RTX 5070 Ti seems meaningful enough; assuming I can find one for a reasonable price.
It's also worth mentioning that AMD is expected to reveal its 9000-series Radeon RDNA 4 GPUs on February 28. The RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT are expected to compete directly with the RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti, so it might be smart to wait and see what AMD has cooked up as competition.

Celanese (NYSE:CE) is facing significant challenges as customer demand deteriorates, negatively impacting both sales volumes and prices. The company anticipates these difficult conditions will persist in the short term, particularly given ongoing softness in key markets including automotive, construction, and industrial applications. The financial impact was severe in the fourth quarter, with Celanese recording a substantial $1.4 billion loss on revenue of $2.4 billion.
CE stock plunged 21% following the earnings announcement. Despite its recent fall, CE stock looks unattractive - making it a bad pick to buy at its current price of around $55. We believe there are several major concerns with CE stock, which makes it unattractive despite its current valuation being very low.
 We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of CE stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Celanese along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very weak operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below.
Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, CE stock looks cheap compared to the broader market.
• Celanese has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 0.7 vs. a figure of 3.1 for the S&P 500
 • Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 7.0 compared to 24.4 for S&P 500
 • And, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 6.0 vs. the benchmark's 24.4
Celanese’s Revenues have declined marginally over recent years.
• Celanese has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 25.8% over the last 3 years (vs. 9.8% for S&P 500)
 • Its revenues have shrunk 2.2% from $11 Bil to $10 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. change of 5.6% for S&P 500)
 • Also, its quarterly revenues shrank 2.8% to $2.6 Bil in the most recent quarter from $2.7 Bil a year ago (vs. 7.2% change for S&P 500)
Celanese’s profit margins are around the median level for companies in the Trefis coverage universe.
• Celanese's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $1.1 Bil, which represents a moderate Operating Margin of 10.5% (vs. 12.6% for S&P 500)
 • Celanese's Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $1.3 Bil, pointing to a moderate OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 12.4% (vs. 14.4% for S&P 500)
Celanese's balance sheet looks very weak.
• Celanese's Debt figure was $13 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $6.0 Bil (as of 2/19/2025). This implies a very poor Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 171.7% (vs. 19.7% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable]
 • Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $813 Mil of the $26 Bil in Total Assets for Celanese. This yields a poor Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 3.1% (vs. 14.1% for S&P 500)
CE stock has fared much worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during the last 2 economic downturns. Worried about the impact of a market crash on CE stock? Our dashboard How Low Can Celanese Stock Go In A Market Crash? has a detailed analysis of how the stock performed during and after previous market crashes.
• CE stock fell 51.7% from a high of $110.25 on 1 January 2020 to $53.24 on 18 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500
 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Covid peak by 11 August 2022 - taking 876 days to recover while the S&P 500 took 148 days
 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $169.28 on 31 March 2024 and currently trades at around $55
• During the 2007-09 recession, CE stock fell from a peak value of $38.38 on 23 June 2008 to $5.81 on 3 March 2009 a decline of 84.9% (vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500)
 • However, the stock fully recovered to its pre-recession peak by 3 May 2013 - taking 1522 days to recoup its losses vs. the 1480 days taken by the S&P 500 to recover
In summary, Celanese's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows:
• Growth: Neutral
 • Profitability: Neutral
 • Financial Stability: Extremely Weak
 • Downturn Resilience: Extremely Weak
 • Overall: Very Weak
Hence, despite its very low valuation, we think that the stock is unattractive, which supports our conclusion that CE is a bad stock to buy.
While you would do well to avoid CE stock for now, you could explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid- and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

You’ll find all of the stock configurations marked down at Amazon for the first time in months with offers starting from $549 and up to $105 in savings. We then move over to the MacBook lineup – the latest M3 Airs with 16GB of RAM are now starting from $899, which is $200 off of the new list prices and $400 under the price they fetched before the RAM upgrade, as well as the most affordable M4 MacBook Pro down at $1,399 ($200 off). All of that joins a host of accessory deals, some new iPhone 16e case offers, and more. 
Amazon has now finally once again dropped the price on the popular new Apple  M4 Mac mini configurations. You’ll find now find the  base M4 mini with the 16GB of RAM and the  256GB internal SSD marked  down to  $549 shipped while the same machine with the  upgraded 512GB SSD is now selling for  $719 shipped (you’ll find other models on sale down below as well). Regularly $599 and $799, respectively, you’re looking at up to $80 in savings and the lowest prices we can find outside of limited in-store offers and the like.
After  reports started to surface that MacBook Air stock was running low at Apple Stores, Amazon came to the rescue with some solid deals. Those unfortunately didn’t stick around for very long before units began to sell out there too, but some of them are now back. While the entry-level 13-inch models are still mostly out of stock at Amazon, it has conjured up some  15-inch models in all colorways with 16GB of RAM and they are now  back down at  $1,099 shipped. That’s $200 off the new $1,299 list price and $400 under the price they fetched before the RAM upgrade last fall.
Here’s how pricing shakes out across the lineup right now – some offers are live at Amazon, some at Best Buy:
After quickly jumping back up in price, we are now once again tracking the  base model 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro down at  $1,399 shipped in silver and Space Black. While shipping is currently delayed on the silver model, the Space Black is ready to be delivered at the discounted rate right now. This is a regularly $1,599 configuration seeing a straight up $200 price drop to mark the lowest price we can find on Apple’s latest and most affordable M4-equipped laptop.

Alibaba (BABA US, 9988 HK) reported financial results after the Hong Kong close and before the U.S. market opened this morning. The company beat on the big three: revenue, adjusted net income, and adjusted EPS, as the company’s core China E-Commerce, international E-Commerce, and cloud units were firing on all cylinders. This follows Jack Ma’s attendance at President Xi’s entrepreneur meeting on Monday. Could Ant Group go public? Maybe, though worth noting, it added $618 million to Alibaba’s bottom line.
The company has gotten “lighter,"" selling out of its physical stores Intime and Sun Art Retail, contributing to the margin expansion. AI was the focus of analysts on the earnings call as management gave a very optimistic look at the cloud’s potential, stating, “The AI era presents a clear and massive demand for infrastructure.” That investment led to increased capex spending that crimped free cash flow -31%. It’s worth pointing out that the company still has $84.58 billion worth of cash on the books. When asked if U.S. chip restrictions would affect the company, CEO Eddie Wu stated no, which gives some further credence to DeepSeek’s claims of utilizing low-end chips energy-efficiently.
Asian equities were a sea of red despite a weak dollar overnight, as only the Shenzhen Composite, Pakistan, and Vietnam were positive.
Hong Kong-listed growth stocks, including recent strong performers in internet, software, and semiconductors, were hit with profit-taking on no news or catalysts. The downdraft, which should be expected, was despite positive remarks from President Trump stating it was “possible” that he would do another trade deal with China, saying, “There’s a little bit of competitiveness, but the relationship I have with President Xi is, I would say a great one.”
President Trump rightly stated that President Biden didn’t push China as there was no negotiation, no communication, nor any attempt to do a deal with China as his administration tried to hobble/cripple the Chinese economy and especially the tech sector. I don’t believe investors have built into the feasibility of President Trump visiting China and doing another deal with President Xi. The negative geopolitical overhang and Western media have kept many global and especially U.S. institutions from buying low in Chinese stocks, in my opinion. That overhang can go away.
Interestingly, currency markets liked Trump's remarks. However, Hong Kong-listed growth stocks were off on elevated volumes, as Alibaba fell -2.58% in advance of financial results after the Hong Kong close on the value of volume 4X the average, Tencent fell -2.21% on volume, nearly 4X the average, and Meituan fell -6.44% on almost 3X the average. Meituan announced it would enroll and pay for its delivery drivers in China’s social security plan while increasing injury insurance. Interesting that Meituan has seen net selling via Southbound Stock Connect, though it is hard to know if it is related to this issue.
JD.com, which fell -0.32%, also stated it would do the same when it enters the delivery space. Mainland investors were net sellers of Hong Kong stocks via Southbound Stock Connect, including the Hong Kong Tracker ETF, which was a large net sell. Healthcare was the top performer in Hong Kong, at +0.61%, and Mainland China, at +2.07%, as Wuxi Apptec gained +2.98% on a broker upgrade. The Mainland market was mixed as growth stocks were mostly higher, except for semiconductors, telecom, and CATL, which fell -1.22%. They held up a bit better on the Mainland than in Hong Kong. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley’s well-respected strategist Jonathan Garner upgraded China to neutral from underweight.
Premier Li presided over a State Council meeting. The key point from the statement below is that it gives an indication of policies coming out of the Dual Sessions in early March. In poker, this is called a tell! This statement has the potential to have significant implications:
“Boosting consumption is an important starting point for expanding domestic demand and stabilizing growth, but also a major measure to change the medium and long term development mode. We should put consumption in a more prominent position and rely more on boosting consumption to expand domestic demand, smooth the economic cycle, and stimulate economic growth. We should make every effort to enhance consumption capacity, adopt more effective consumption promotion policies, break the barriers and constraints restricting consumption, make every effort to optimize the consumption environment, and strive to open up the chain of consumption, driving investment, industrial upgrading, and employment and income increase.”
The Hang Seng and Hang Seng Tech indexes fell -1.60% and -3.04%, respectively, on volume that increased +8.14% from yesterday, which is 195% of the 1-year average. 176 stocks advanced, while 311 stocks declined. Main Board short turnover increased by +8.37% from yesterday, which is 174% of the 1-year average, as 14% of turnover was short turnover (Hong Kong short turnover includes ETF short volume, which is driven by market makers’ ETF hedging). The value factor and large caps fell less than the growth factor and small caps. Health Care, which gained +0.61%, was the only positive sector. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Real Estate, which fell -2.90%, Consumer Discretionary, which fell -2.74%, and Communication Services, which fell -2.47%. The top-performing subsectors were consumer services, national defense, and healthcare equipment, while media, consumer durables, apparel, and semiconductors were among the worst-performing. Southbound Stock Connect volumes were 3X pre-stimulus levels as Mainland investors sold -$815 million of Hong Kong-listed stocks and ETFs led by SMIC and China Mobile were moderate net buys, UB Tech Robotics a small net buy, Hong Kong Tracker ETF a very large net sell, Tencent a large net sell, Xiaomi, Meituan and Kuaishou small net sells.
Shanghai, Shenzhen, and STAR Board diverged to close -0.02%, +0.55%, and -0.14%, respectively, on volume that increased +2.08% from yesterday, which is 156% of the 1-year average. 3,161 stocks advanced, while 1,899 declined. The growth factor and small caps outperformed the value factor and large caps. The top-performing sectors were Health Care, which gained +2.07%, Materials, which gained +0.47%, and Consumer Discretionary, which gained +0.47%. Meanwhile, the worst-performing sectors were Communication Services, which fell -2.1%, Real Estate, which fell -0.83%, and Industrials, which fell -0.31%. The top-performing subsectors were healthcare, leisure products, and retail, while telecom, insurance, and marine/shipping were the worst. Northbound Stock Connect volumes were well above average. CNY and the Asia dollar index gained versus the U.S. dollar. Treasury bonds fell. Copper and steel rose.

32,2025-02-20,"Microsoft Surface today is all about maintaining Windows ecosystem health and sticking to the status quo, not experimental new form factors and categories. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Surface has entered into a new era, and you might not have even noticed. In the last 18 months, big changes have occurred in the Surface division internally at Microsoft, and it began with the departure of Panos Panay and introduction of new leadership, tasked with tightening the leash and refocusing the Surface portfolio.
In the past, Surface was all about unique form factors and experimental hardware. In some ways, it was anti-Apple in its approach to hardware design. The Surface RT/Pro, Surface Book, and Surface Studio were products that Apple would simply never make, and that’s what made Surface special and exciting.
Microsoft also used Surface to set the narrative and dictate where it thinks the Windows ecosystem should head. This was the case with the Surface RT/Pro with Windows RT/8, the Surface Book with Windows 10, the Surface Neo with Windows 10X, and the Surface Laptop Studio with Windows 11.
Today however, things seem very different. The current wave of Surface hardware isn’t interested in being experimental or unique. It wants the latest Surface Pro and Surface Laptop to blend in with the market and appeal to the largest possible audience, and that means ensuring its latest hardware doesn’t rock the boat.
Unfortunately, that means the more extravagant Surface hardware of yesteryear no longer has a place in today’s Surface portfolio. Devices like the Surface Studio and Surface Duo that appealed to niche markets have been given the boot, and the focus is now entirely on hardware that resonates with business customers and wider markets.

Last year, Microsoft kickstarted a new category of AI-powered Windows computers called Copilot+ PCs, spearheaded by Surface and Snapdragon X. In a lot of ways, this launch hearkened back to the original Surface RT/Pro launch in 2012, which were designed to set the stage for a new category of Windows PC and raise the bar for OEMs to follow.
Of course, the launch of Windows RT/8 and Surface RT/Pro ultimately flopped, and it’s fair to say that was mostly because of Microsoft’s heavy handedness in its approach. The company wanted to push forward Windows on Arm, a new category of hardware, and new Windows experiences that the market ultimately rejected all at once.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
It was all very exciting, but ultimately too much change for most people. Comparatively, the Copilot+ PC launch has taken a far more conservative approach in pushing forward new category and platform changes. But all three pillars remain: Windows on Arm, a new category of hardware, and new Windows experiences.
Except this time, it’s less about radical new form factors and Windows experiences, and more about pushing things forward while maintaining the status quo as much as it can. The new Surface PCs aren’t experimental new devices, but revisions on tried and tested designs. The new Windows experiences aren’t part of a new Windows 12, but rather an update to the already familiar Windows 11.
Most importantly, the Copilot+ PC launch gave Windows on Arm an opportunity to shine. Snapdragon chips are finally at a point where they can compete in the Windows ecosystem in both performance and compatibility aspects. This was essentially a relaunch for Windows on Arm, and so it needed to stick the landing.
This conservative approach was vital to ensure the success of the Copilot+ PC launch. Alienating the market once again wasn't an option. Microsoft needed to ""normalize"" Windows on Arm while pushing new AI experiences to advance the Windows platform, and the best way to ensure this sits well with the market is to not rock the boat as much as possible. That means Surface & Windows needed to be boring.
Had Copilot+ PCs launched five years ago, I can easily imagine them launching with a radical new Surface form factor of some kind, alongside a new version of Windows that significantly changes how the platform looks and feels, potentially alienating the market once more.

Surface has always been about setting the stage for the Windows ecosystem, and I don't think that has changed. It's the execution that has changed, taking a more conservative approach in dictating the narrative and focusing more on overall Windows ecosystem health rather than trying to create new markets.
Surface today is more focused on what's on the inside rather than the outside. Things like NPUs and the AI experiences that utilize them is what's important for the Windows ecosystem right now, and that's where Surface still serves its purpose when it comes to dictating the path for Windows.
To be clear, the latest Surface PCs are excellent. The Surface Pro 11 and Surface Laptop 7 are Microsoft's best hardware yet, and I believe the company will continue to strive to build the best products it can. However, it's obvious that the focus is no longer on bombastic form factor exploration, but rather, perfection on mainstream categories.
I think that going forward, Microsoft will leave form factor experimentation up to its OEM partners, and Surface will be used to ""validate"" new form factors as popularized by the market. Lenovo is already pushing the boat out with radical new designs, and if any happen to catch on, Windows and Surface will respond.
Ultimately, I believe we're now in an era of stability and conservatism in the Surface space. I don't think we're going to see big hardware or software changes for at least a while, as the company focuses on getting Windows 10 users to move to Windows 11 and Copilot+ PCs.
That might change in the future, but for now, buckle in for sensible Surface devices and iterative updates, because that's what the market wants right now.

33,2025-02-20,"The closing credits of 2021's No Time To Die, the most recent film in the 007 series, ended with a familiar message: ""James Bond will return.""
But for the last few years, fans haven't been so sure. 
A year after the release of Daniel Craig's final film in the franchise, Amazon bought the series' parent company MGM. Since then, very little has happened. 
That finally changed on Thursday, when Amazon announced a new joint venture that will see long-term Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson step back, and Jeff Bezos's company take full creative control.
In the intervening years, it's been widely reported that there was tension between Amazon, who understandably wanted a return on their investment, and Wilson and Broccoli, whose top priority remained protecting the Bond brand. 
The news of the deal has been met with mixed reaction from 007 fans. 
""I'm in two minds,"" says David Zaritsky, creator of The Bond Experience fan channel on YouTube and Instagram.
""The nostalgic part of my mind feels a little bit of sadness. Broccoli and Wilson have been the custodians for all these years, so it feels like a bit of royal blood in lineage has been severed. 
""That being said, nobody likes inactivity. And there's been a lot of inactivity around the James Bond franchise for many years, and I know that Amazon as a company will not have patience for inactivity.
""So I'm very hopeful, and dare I say even a little bit excited, that they're going to do something with the franchise that will be interesting nonetheless.""
Other franchises which have drastically expanded perhaps offer some clues about what we can expect from the forthcoming Amazon era of Bond. 
Lancelot Narayan, a James Bond historian, journalist and filmmaker, told BBC Radio 5 Live a good comparison is George Lucas selling Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, giving the company control of the Star Wars brand. 
""They went off and made that sequel trilogy, and whether you like it or not, it got made rather quickly,"" he notes. ""There wasn't a three-year wait between films.""
However, despite the explosion in productivity, there is a feeling that both Marvel and Star Wars have overstretched themselves with their spin-off products. 
Narayan says he believes Star Wars has become ""creatively redundant"" since the explosion in productivity.
""The Star Wars TV series have been very hit and miss – Andor is fantastic, The Mandalorian is OK, I haven't seen Skeleton Crew... but there are very disparate creative voices going on there,"" he notes. ""So this is the worry, you need the correct creative people to run the show.""
Similarly, the Marvel Cinematic Universe built on the films by launching a string of Disney+ TV shows.
The subsequent decline in Marvel's popularity arguably owes much to fan fatigue, something which won't have been helped by the huge number of story strands they had to keep up with.
Both cases, Marvel and Star Wars, highlight the risks of brand expansion, which can cause long-term damage for short-term financial gain. 
Fans will be hoping any Bond extensions will be better than 2023's dubious game show 007: Road to a Million, hosted by Succession's Brian Cox, which was poorly received.
The James Bond franchise, and particularly the subject of which actor will take over from Craig, is of such fascination to the public that it's the focus of a new show currently playing in Cirencester, called A Role To Die For.
""There are a lot of people who have grown up with it, for whom James Bond has been part of their culture their entire lives,"" says the appropriately named Derek Bond, who directs the show.
""As time has gone on, being able to reinvent that character and have him perhaps change with the times, has been the secret to his longevity. 
""But I wonder if we're now in a situation where the times have changed so much, that James Bond now feels as if he belongs in a different era, and it needs something really radical to keep him relevant today.""
One area the company will almost certainly be looking at now they're in creative control is the potential for character origin stories, in a similar vein to other famous and beloved film characters who have received their own spin-off films.
Cruella, an extension of the 101 Dalmatians villain, and Wonka, of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, have both been hugely successful film spin-offs in their own right in the last five years, with Emma Stone and Timothée Chalamet respectively bringing the characters and worlds to a whole new audience. 
It's not hard to imagine the popularity of a similar film or show based on famous Bond villains such as Jaws, Oddjob, Blofeld, Goldfinger or May Day - all big brands in their own right.
""I mean, why has nobody made Moneypenny?!"" laughs Derek Bond. ""There's a great series to made about her and her journey. 
""Also M, I'd love to know how Judi Dench's M ended up in that role. And the villains especially, it's a very rich universe, and it's easy to imagine the Marvelisation of it, where you have a kind of spin-off for every character that James Bond ever passed in a corridor.""
But Zaritsky notes: ""I think Amazon will stop short of doing it ad nauseum, to the point where they're having spin-offs about the MI6 janitor that sleeps in the corner. If they do have spin-offs, I think it's going to be prime characters.""
Not everyone is a fan of the idea. ""This is quite possibly the WORST thing to happen to this franchise,"" tweeted Griffin Schiller of Film Speak after Amazon's announcement.
""James Bond was more than your average franchise. It had class, prestige, they were indie films made as blockbusters... now? It'll be milked dry. It's truly the end.""
Broccoli has been seen as a steward of the brand throughout her tenure; a safe pair of hands who protected the traditions of the original character. 
That may not necessarily have been compatible with Amazon, who were presumably looking to buy a brand rather than only a film franchise, in an effort to maximise profit.
""It does tend to be a slightly older generation that it skews to, and there's a whole generation of people who have not experienced a James Bond film, and now, I wonder if they will,"" Bond says.
In her own tenure, Broccoli has made efforts to keep attracting young audiences in other ways, however, such as selecting popular young artists such as Billie Eilish to sing the theme songs.
A repositioning of of the brand could see Amazon try to take the franchise in a direction that appeals more to a younger audience as well as an American market, which is culturally slightly cooler on the Bond brand than the UK. 
""I think it's quite bad news for the franchise, and British film as a whole,"" movie journalist Hannah Strong told Radio 4's PM following Amazon's announcement.
""It's the premier British film property, and I think the control reverting to an American company, not least one that hasn't shown that much commitment to great cinema, is probably quite a worrying sign.""
That said, Amazon will be aware that Bond makes a huge amount of money as it currently is - and that altering the core product itself in a way that appeals more to an American audience would be a huge risk.
Strong added: ""When Amazon bought MGM, Barbara Broccoli was quite outspoken about the fact she was finding it difficult to come to a middle ground with Amazon. I suspect the middle ground involves an awful lot of money.""
The biggest decision remains who will replace Craig in the leading role. 
Broccoli previously said James Bond could be any race, but that he would remain male. That guarantee may no longer stand now she is has handed over the reins, although her approach was widely regarded as sensible and Amazon are unlikely to rock the boat too much.
How long could it be until we see the first new Bond product? Zaritsky suggests Amazon won't wait around, although the first thing to launch may not be a film.
""It could be with merchandise, or in the form of fan outreach,"" he says. ""Whatever it is, I think we might see something extremely fast.""
Daniel Craig's replacement will be Amazon's biggest decision after gaining control of the franchise.
Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson step down after decades of tight family control of the franchise.

Microsoft on Wednesday unveiled Majorana 1, a quantum chip the company says is powered by a new state of matter.

        CEO Satya Nadella described it as a ""breakthrough"" in the advancement of quantum computing.
    

        ""Most of us grew up learning there are three main types of matter that matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Today, that changed,"" Nadella said in a post on X. ""After a nearly 20 year pursuit, we've created an entirely new state of matter, unlocked by a new class of materials, topoconductors, that enable a fundamental leap in computing. It powers Majorana 1, the first quantum processing unit built on a topological core. We believe this breakthrough will allow us to create a truly meaningful quantum computer not in decades, as some have predicted, but in years.""
    

Quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field of technology that combines the disciplines of computer science, math, and quantum mechanics to solve more complex calculations more quickly than is possible through classical computing. The foundation of quantum computing relies on units of information called qubits, rather than the binary bits used in classical computing.
    

        Qubits exist in multiple states at once, like a spinning coin appearing to show both heads and tails simultaneously. They behave differently when observed and require specific conditions such as low light or extremely cold environments to replicate results reliably and without errors, which has made advancement in the field slow going.
    

        But when they behave predictably at a large enough scale, qubits enable quantum computers to quickly calculate equations with multiple solutions and perform advanced computations that would be impossible for classical computers.
    

        Researchers in the field agree that computations solvable through quantum computing could help discover new drugs, promote sustainable food growth in harsh climates, and develop new chemical compounds that break down plastics or break our current encryption methods, among other outcomes.
    

        Nadellahassaid he believes quantum will be a global game changer when used in conjunction with advancements in artificial intelligence.
    

        In an appearance on the ""Dwarkesh Podcast, Nadella said quantum computing would be most useful for exploring how various compounds work in different states, like advancements in chemical physics and biology, rather than the data-heavy processing that AI is best at.
    

        ""The way I think of it is, if you have AI plus quantum, maybe you'll use quantum to generate synthetic data that then gets used by AI to train better models that know how to model something like chemistry or physics or what have you,"" Nadella said in the podcast. ""These two things will get used together.""
    

Microsoft said in a press release that its topological superconductor is a new material that isn't solid, liquid, or gas,which the company fabricated atom by atom. Where many familiar electronic devices rely on the raw material silicon in their semiconductors, Microsoft said in peer-reviewed findings released in Nature that its topological superconductor was a path forward for quantum computing to produce more stable qubits.
    

        Troy Nelson, the chief technology officer at Lastwall, a cybersecurity provider of quantum resilient technology, told Business Insider that, since the behavior of quantum systems is often hard to prove because of the unstable nature of qubits, he'd like to see more real-world testing to confirm Microsoft's findings. He said, however, that he was ""more on the optimistic side of cautiously optimistic"" about the company's announcement.
    

        ""What they've done is they've created a new foundation that we can build off of,"" Nelson said. ""Now we need to solve the production problems like the economies of scale and bringing costs down. But I see what they produced here as a new road map.""
    

        Microsoft's new topological architecture was used to develop its Majorana 1 processor, offering what the company called in its press release ""a clear path to fit a million qubits on a single chip that can fit in the palm of one's hand.""
    

        ""This is a needed threshold for quantum computers to deliver transformative, real-world solutions — such as breaking down microplastics into harmless byproducts or inventing self-healing materials for construction, manufacturing or healthcare,"" Microsoft's press release reads. ""All the world's current computers operating together can't do what a one-million-qubit quantum computer will be able to do.""
    

        Nelson said Microsoft's topological breakthrough, if it can be replicated by other researchers in the field, would be a turning point that shortens the timeline for developing fully functional quantum computers to just years.
    

        ""If we really can print topoconductor to chips the size of your hand, that's just as revolutionary as the silicon transistor,"" Nelson said.
    

        Microsoft's stock rose 1.25% on Wednesday following the announcement of its new quantum chip.
    

        While Microsoft's Majorana 1 chip doesn't mean commercially useful quantum computing is right around the corner, it's the latest in a series of significant advancements in the field that leads some researchers to believe more widespread, commercial adoption will come sooner than previously expected.
    

        In December, Google unveiled Willow, its new quantum chip, which the company says can perform a standard benchmark computation in under five minutes — a task that would take the current fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years to complete; a timeframe that exceeds the age of the universe.
    

        But not everyone is convinced. Quantum stocks tumbled in January after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang suggested we were still 20 years away from the technology being ""very useful.""

 Funko Pop Marvel Rivals: Magneto 
 $12 | Releases May 13 
 Funko Pop Marvel Rivals: Iron Man 
 $12 | Releases May 27 
 Funko Pop Marvel Rivals: Doctor Doom 
 $12 | Releases May 27 
 Funko Pop Marvel Rivals: Galacta 
 $25 | Releases May 2025 
 
Marvel Rivals has been popular since it launched on PC and consoles in December 2024, partly thanks to its imaginative redesigns of familiar superheroes and supervillains. Naturally, Funko Pop is releasing its own versions of the characters, and the first batch is now available to preorder through Amazon and Entertainment Earth. There are four figures in Funko Pop's first wave of Marvel Rivals collectibles, including Iron Man, Magento, and Doctor Doom that are all available now for $12, plus a $25 special edition version of Galacta.

40,2025-02-20,"The Honor Alpha Plan could be a huge new change to the company's AI strategy.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2025 is just a few short weeks from now, and companies have already begun to tease what's in store for the big annual show. Honor just launched a pair of new phones so it looks like the company will be focusing on the software front for MWC this year, pushing forward with a new AI-focused concept it calls the Honor Alpha Plan.
Last year's launch of the Honor Magic 6 Pro came with a full commitment to leading with AI-forward features, particularly where the phone's camera was concerned. At the time, the concept was still fairly new among phones, as Samsung had just announced Galaxy AI and most other AI-powered features baked into Android used AI before the term was in vogue.
The biggest issue with Honor's AI launch last year was compatibility with non-Honor devices and services. The rollout of Magic OS 9 alongside the Honor Magic 7 Pro helped push that forward, with features like Magic Portal receiving support for hundreds of apps and a cool knuckle gesture that works a lot like Circle to search. This builds on Google's function by making it easy to share things you circle, not just search for them.

At MWC, we expect big things from the brand-new CEO of Honor, Jian Li, who just replaced previous CEO George Zhao in mid-January. No doubt, Li is looking to make his mark on the company as he sets the tone for the rest of the year, and the Honor Alpha Plan sounds exactly like what we might expect.
As you might imagine from the name, the word ""Alpha"" is the beginning of the Greek alphabet and likely a new path forward for the company's AI pursuits. Companies are spending more on AI in 2025 than ever, and the crown for the best AI in the land seems to change every week. It's not likely that Honor is going to jump into the fray with the likes of Open AI, Grok, Gemini, and Deepseek, but it certainly would make sense for the company to start launching more AI-forward devices in the future.
The question is whether that means adding more AI-enhanced features to its phones — like the brand-new AI telephoto feature on the Magic 7 Pro — or if it means dedicated AI devices. One pioneer in this sector, the Humane AI Pin, just called it quits. While the concept of a screenless device powered by an AI assistant is extremely futuristic, Humane's implementation of the concept left a lot to be desired.

But I could easily see a company like Honor moving in to take advantage of the interest in this market by using its expertise on AI and device ecosystems. Honor already produces laptops, smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and more that all link together in impressively cohesive ways.

I use an Honor MagicBook Art 14 Snapdragon Edition as my main laptop, and it pairs perfectly (and seamlessly) with the Honor Magic 7 RSR and two Honor tablets that I have. Using a tablet as a second laptop screen is as easy as hitting the ""connect"" button that pops up when the tablet is unlocked, and the same goes for bigger screen foldable phones like the Honor Magic V3.
Most of the company's improvement happened throughout 2024, and 2025 looks to be the best year yet. Android Central Phones editor Harish Jonnalagadda wrote about Honor's impressive upward trajectory, and I have no doubt the new CEO is aiming even higher with the Honor Alpha Plan when it's unveiled at MWC.

Jian Li comes from a Huawei background, at a time when the company led smartphone camera innovation before U.S. trade sanctions stymied the business for a few years. Now, Li has moved on to the helm of Honor and is clearly ready to take the company to the next level internationally.
While I could hope for a proper U.S. release of the company's products, I dare not hold my breath in the current political climate. Instead, I think the company will focus even more on unique AI features that are being copied by rivals and dedicated AI-forward devices that will work well with all sorts of devices, not just Honor's.
After all, the Alpha Plan's currently laid-out vision states that Honor ""is committed to fostering an open and collaborative environment where innovation thrives through partnership."" Given that the latest Honor devices work better than ever with Google's own Gemini services, it makes sense to me that Honor would push itself to be the leading international Android brand, especially since Samsung has been so stagnant in the past few years.

More crime for your no money
Chirpy cockney urchin Strauss Zelnick recently hailed the ""increasing"" importance of the PC market in the lead up to Grand Theft Auto 6's release this autumn. Could it mean we're getting the open world crimeathon the same time as consoles? Buddy, we don't even get updates the same time as consoles. Things might be speeding up on that front at least, based on an email Colin Rockstar sent us earlier. On March 4th, they're giving us some nice gubbins for GTA 5 that they previously saw fit to exclusively roll out on machines that don't even have the original Minesweeper.
The upgrade is free ""with a one-time Character Migration flow to bring over your Story Mode and Online progress"", and offers new vehicles and vehicle performance upgrades, animal encounters, new graphics options, and faster loading time. There's also a ""and much more"" in there but Colin loves saying that. You can find the full details on Rockstar's website here.
From the press release:
New Features on PC
I gave up on Red Dead Online once it became apparent that Rockstar sneered so hard they tasted their own nostrils every time someone mentioned it, but animal photography feels like a direct transplant from there, no? I haven't touched GTA 5 for years, mind, so I'm not sure if it was already in the game. The update will also feature ""recent player experience improvements for GTA Online, including kernel-based anti-cheat protections, and proactive voice chat moderation to help keep GTA Online safe, secure and fun for everyone"". Thanks Colin!
In other crime news, Rockstar Games have been reportedly been thinking about letting GTA 6 players modify the game’s map with Roblox and Fortnite-style creation mechanics.

42,2025-02-20,"The iPhone 16e and iPhone 15 now sit at the bottom of Apple's iPhone lineup at $599 and $699, respectively. While the 16e shares many important features with the ‌iPhone 15‌, there are still 30 significant differences between the devices to be aware of–not least Apple Intelligence support.
There is a merely $100 price difference between the ‌iPhone 15‌ and ‌iPhone 16e‌. To justify this, the ‌iPhone 16e‌ misses out on features such as the Dynamic Island and MagSafe connectivity. However, there are some areas where the 16e is actively better than the 15, such as the Action button, chip, and battery life. Here's everything that's different:

Choosing between the ‌iPhone 15‌ and ‌iPhone 16e‌ is not a wholly straightforward decision. While the ‌iPhone 15‌ is $100 more expensive than the ‌iPhone 16e‌, it misses out on the Action button, Wind noise reduction, Audio Mix, Spatial Audio recording, the A18 chip and ‌Apple Intelligence‌, Visual intelligence, the C1 modem, and six additional hours of battery life.
Instead, the $100 jump is seemingly justified by the ‌Dynamic Island‌, brighter display, Ultra Wide camera, sensor-shift image stabilization, next-generation portraits, Macro mode, Cinematic mode, Action mode, Thread and Ultra Wideband connectivity, ‌MagSafe‌, and color options–which may not be important to some customers.
The ‌iPhone 15‌'s lack of ‌Apple Intelligence‌ support is a major omission and it is difficult to recommend a device that is more expensive, less powerful, and less future proof. The ‌iPhone 16e‌ is a better long-term investment since it is likely to support future ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features, offering a better long-term experience and more desirability in the second-hand market. Its markedly better battery life is also worth noting when it comes to the long-term view of using the device. The ‌iPhone 16e‌ is almost a year and a half newer than the ‌iPhone 15‌.
If the large display of the 6.7-inch ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus is essential, then it is likely still worth opting for this option over the ‌iPhone 16e‌. Likewise, if an Ultra Wide camera or ‌MagSafe‌ are absolutely essential, the ‌iPhone 15‌ is the only way to go. Otherwise, most customers should save the $100 and buy the ‌iPhone 16e‌.

44,2025-02-20,"If aliens exist, Apple may be about to tell the origin story of how we found out…
Deadline exclusively reports that Apple Original Films is the likely suitor for an upcoming movie centered around UFO disclosure. The untitled sci-fi (fiction, debatable) film is expected to focus on events in recent years around the U.S. government’s disclosure of previously classified footage of what is now called a UAP (unidentified aerial phenomena or unidentified anomalous phenomena). For years, the stigma surrounding unidentified flying objects (UFOs) was too strong for serious discussion
More from Deadline’s reporting:
The package market has been booming over the past couple weeks and here is another one that looks to have found its new home. Sources tell Deadline that Apple Original Films is in talks to land the untitled UFO package that has Joseph Kosinski directing and Jerry Bruckheimer producing. Zach Baylin penned the script, which is akin to a UFO disclosure-themed take on All the President’s Men, the classic 1976 political thriller from Alan J. Pakula.
Apple’s relationship with Top Gun producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Joseph Kosinski reportedly strengthened through their collaboration on the upcoming Apple Original Films title F1.  As for the subject of UAPs, any respectable blink-182 and Angels & Airwaves fan must acknowledge Tom DeLonge’s role in disclosure, as detailed in The New York Times.

A fourth-generation family business was heading into uncharted waters. The family consisted of two sets of cousins: a pair of brothers and a pair of sisters. The brothers had been running the business since their fathers retired. The sisters were passive owners, fully informed and had built successful careers elsewhere.
They were debating the future of their business, as all the owners either had or would soon retire. Some wanted to sell and maximize proceeds; others were more concerned with taking care of employees than making money. The two options under consideration were selling control or converting to an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP).
But time marched on. The two brothers were moving into retirement. The family appointed a senior manager to be the CEO, the first time a non-family person ran one of their businesses. It was an inflection point in the business and presented a risk going forward. The new CEO was young, had not managed this size of organization and would need a few years to mature in the position. The industry was undergoing a transition, which would likely prove to be difficult to navigate for any CEO.
The sisters were a few years older than the brothers and felt it was time to get their money out of the business. The brothers wanted to take care of the employees since they had spent much of their lives working with these people. While the sisters wanted to sell the business outright, the brothers wanted to convert to an ESOP to give the employees the benefit of future growth.
ESOPs are tax-advantaged and allow the sellers to get their cash and give equity to the employees, but they do put debt on the business. Employees receive value over time, but many employees don’t really understand equity or how an ESOP works. An ESOP does not pay the bills today. An ESOP pays fair market value and must operate within defined constraints.
The business never had debt, and the management had never had to manage bank covenants during a down cycle. Their industry was highly cyclic. But the business was highly profitable, growing strongly and had a great balance sheet. There would be buyers who would likely pay a synergistic premium above what an ESOP was allowed to pay.
They knew that another option was to sell to the highest bidder and give cash bonuses to employees, which would provide immediate benefits. This was a simpler path with its own risks, but it should give all the owners what they want.
The brothers had an emotional attachment to the ESOP path since it would provide more of a legacy than cash bonuses. This created a conflict.
The new CEO was concerned since he knew the owners and how to work with them, and those relationships were an impetus to accepting the position. But he did not know who the trustees of the ESOP would be or how they would treat him. He would have several new bosses to learn how to work with while navigating a difficult market environment.
Each path has unique risks that need to be considered. Putting the business up for sale does not mean a deal gets done or on acceptable terms. The sale process may be difficult and expensive. This family was concerned about having to share their information with potential buyers.
The ownership structure did not have a dominant shareholder. Each of the owners had equal sway. Having worked together their whole lives, there were no surprises on who wanted what and how they would negotiate.
They were stuck since no one had the voting power to drive a decision.
When they asked me what to do, I presented them with a different viewpoint. The analytics were easy. The family and the employees would likely be better off with a sale/bonus, where a new owner would invest in continued growth. It was simpler to explain than an ESOP. Not every employee would like it, and some would likely work elsewhere. No one owes you a job, you must earn your keep everyday.
An ESOP would not be able to provide growth capital or likely be able to attract new talent as well. It would create the incentive to turn the business from a growth engine to a cash cow to pay down the debt and fund additional purchases. If the business had a downturn, employees would lose value in their equity and would be unable to make individual decisions. It would make the new job harder for the CEO.
ESOPs are a great solution for some situations, but knowing the family well, I just didn’t think it was the best solution for their situation. In truth, we could make either path work for the family if they would just make the decision.
I told them that if they did not figure this out soon, the decision would be made for them. While they dithered with indecision, one day, someone would get sick, incapacitated or die. They would be forced to buy back that person’s stock, as stipulated in the ownership agreement. This would force a sale at an inconvenient time since no individual, and likely not the company, could afford the buyout. Events would cascade from there. I was more concerned with the loss of control and what it would mean for the family and employees than trying to guess a perfect outcome.
While there may not be one right answer, they did need an answer. Balancing owner demands like this requires experience and judgment. At some point, a decision just needs to be made, even though not everyone will like it.

48,2025-02-20,"Dogecoin is making headlines once again. The reason? The Securities and Exchange Commission has officially acknowledged Grayscale’s filings for a spot Dogecoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust. This marks the beginning of the SEC’s review process, which could potentially bring the Dogecoin ETF to the stock exchanges.
For crypto enthusiasts, this is a significant milestone. The largest crypto asset manager backing the most popular memecoin underscores how far Dogecoin has come—from a joke to a potential mainstream investment vehicle.
“It’s remarkable and is an enduring testament to the power of crypto communities, said Noelle Acheson, a crypto analyst and author of the “Crypto is Macro Now” newsletter.
She noted in her email to Quartz that Doge’s success is a reminder that public networks belong to the market, which ultimately determines their success, not any individual team or entity.
On Wednesday, Dogecoin was hovering at $0.25 per coin, marking a 2% increase in the past 24 hours.
Created as a joke by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer in 2013, Dogecoin features the likeness of the Shiba Inu dog popularized in the Doge meme. But since then, Dogecoin has transformed into one of the world’s most valuable cryptocurrencies.
Doge’s success can largely be traced to the GameStop saga when a group of small investors, encouraged by the Reddit community “WallStreetBets” and helped along by an Elon Musk tweet, skyrocketed GameStop (GME-0.45%) shares to $86.88 in January 2021.
On Reddit, investors later discussed what cryptocurrency was equivalent to GameStop — and the answer was Dogecoin. Just as GameStop reached its peak, Dogecoin started to gain traction, peaking in May 2021 at $0.74 per coin.
After the GameStop saga, another event sent Dogecoin soaring: Elon Musk tweeted “Doge” in February 2021. The price of Dogecoin surged dramatically, and crypto enthusiasts suddenly became interested in Dogecoin.
Later that year, Musk hosted NBC’s (CMCSA+0.30%) “Saturday Night Live” and called himself a Dogefather. He continued promoting Dogecoin on various platforms, leading to its inclusion in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.
Musk once said Doge is his favorite cryptocurrency because “it has the best humor and it has dogs.”
Moreover, when President Donald Trump was re-elected, he announced that Musk would lead the “Department of Government Efficiency,” or DOGE—effectively a non-governmental group that will consult on spending. This further solidified Musk’s relationship with Dogecoin.
Given the strong backing Dogecoin has received from the crypto community and Elon Musk, it’s natural to wonder: Will the SEC approve a Dogecoin ETF?
Just a few years ago, the idea of Bitcoin ETFs seemed far-fetched. Yet, after securing SEC approval in January 2024, Bitcoin ETFs have become the most successful in history, even surpassing gold ETFs.
However, SEC approval is far from guaranteed. The SEC Commissioner, Hester Peirce, a known crypto advocate, recently warned investors about the risks of memecoins, emphasizing that they don’t fall under the SEC’s purview.
Moreover, for an ETF to gain approval, several factors come into play, including price tracking, market liquidity, anti-manipulation safeguards, etc.
According to Acheson, a Dogecoin ETF could happen — but not anytime soon. She believes the market isn’t ready, and premature approval could raise concerns rather than confidence.
For now, Acheson finds it encouraging that the SEC is at least acknowledging these applications and considering some of the more unconventional ones.
While approval remains uncertain, experts say a Dogecoin ETF could reshape the investment landscape.
“It would be huge,” Acheson said when asked about the potential approval of a Dogecoin ETF.
If the SEC gives Dogecoin ETF the green light, it would mark a significant financial and cultural milestone — not just for the crypto space but for mainstream finance as well. Such an approval could pave the way for more community-driven assets to enter institutional portfolios, redefining what qualifies as an investable asset.

50,2025-02-20,"The weight-loss drug boom has transformed Eli Lilly (LLY-1.00%), the maker of Zepbound, into the largest healthcare company in the world. Now, the pharma giant wants to reinvest its success with weight-loss meds into tackling some of the world’s toughest health challenges.
“I think the obesity opportunity has both been eye-opening in terms of the impact to human health that a company can have,” Eli Lilly chief scientific officer Dan Skovronsky told CNBC in an interview. “And then also it’s given us the resources to look for other [opportunities].”
Skovronsky told the outlet that the company is now working to tackle other diseases  like Alzheimer’s, neurodegenerative diseases, heart health and even hearing loss.
Eli Lilly first launched its diabetes medication Mounjaro in 2022. A year later, it started selling the same drug for weight loss under the brand Zepbound. The treatments belong to a class of drugs known as GLP-1s, made popular by Novo Nordisk’s (NVO-0.42%) Ozempic, that mimic gut hormones that regulate blood sugar and suppress appetite. 
These drugs have propelled the company’s sales in recent years. Zepbound sales alone reached $1.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, compared with $176 million during the same period in 2023, when it first launched. The company’s total sales for the year across all drugs came to $45 billion. Eli Lilly projects that sales in 2025 will reach between $58 billion and $61 billion.
The company’s stock price has surged over 200% in the past three years. It currently has a market cap of $785 billion.
Eli Lilly last year launched a treatment for Alzheimer’s and is already testing it for the prevention of the disease, Skovronsky said. He also highlighted the company’s work in gene therapy: In one trial, the company has been able to restore a patient’s hearing. 
“As right now Eli Lilly is the biggest healthcare company in the world, probably the biggest healthcare company in the world ever, we have an obligation,” Skovronsky told CNBC (CMCSA+0.30%). “We see that as an obligation to invest in some of these big problems that are hiding in plain sight, to try and make a difference for the health of humanity.”

Intel stock surged nearly 16% on Tuesday after a Wall Street Journal report suggested that Broadcom and TSMC were considering potential bids for the renowned chipmaker. Broadcom is said to be eyeing Intel’s chip design businesses, while TSMC might seek a stake or full control of Intel’s manufacturing operations. No formal offers have been made yet, according to the report. However, Intel’s business has been showing encouraging signs of recovery. The company's manufacturing processes, which are key to its foundry strategy, have hit important milestones, and its newest chips have received positive reviews. Additionally, U.S. government policies favor domestic manufacturers like Intel, raising the question: Is this really the right time to sell?
Intel has made substantial investments in its U.S.-based foundry business over recent years. Despite the unit losing nearly $13 billion last year, Intel may be on the brink of a turnaround. The Intel 3 process node has been in mass production for several months, powering Xeon 6 data center chips. Meanwhile, the latest Intel 18A process is being sampled by laptop manufacturers. Intel has previously stated that the 18A process could help it regain “process leadership,” meaning it would have the most advanced semiconductor manufacturing technology after trailing behind TSMC and Samsung for years. Intel’s process holds key advantages. While both Intel 18A and TSMC’s N2 process use gate-all-around transistors, Intel’s additional innovation—backside power delivery—enhances efficiency and performance. Confidence in Intel’s technology is also rising, with Microsoft and Amazon contracting Intel to fabricate some of their custom chips, including AI accelerators, a trend that could continue. For investors seeking a more stable option than a single stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and delivered over 91% returns since its inception.
Former President Donald Trump has been a strong proponent of strengthening U.S. manufacturing, which could benefit Intel given its significant domestic fabrication capacity. The current administration also aims to ensure AI chips are both designed and manufactured in the U.S. to safeguard American intellectual property. This policy direction could lead to regulatory support, such as tariffs or incentives, encouraging more companies to source their chips from Intel rather than foreign foundries. By handing over control to TSMC, Intel shareholders could risk missing out on this potential upside. See how Trump and new manufacturing processes are boosting Intel stock.
Intel’s newest processors are receiving strong reviews. Initial benchmarks from PassMark indicate that Intel’s Arrow Lake-based Core Ultra 9 chip outperforms AMD’s Ryzen 9 processor by approximately 7% in CPU performance tests. It is also 34% faster than its predecessor, the i9-14900HX, with a 9% improvement in single-thread performance. Unlike Intel’s AI-focused Lunar Lake chips, these new processors are designed to maximize raw computing power for intensive productivity and creative tasks. This launch arrives at a strategic moment—over the past two years, companies have focused heavily on GPUs to support AI initiatives while reducing traditional CPU investments. As CPU spending rebounds, Intel may be well-positioned to regain market share.
Intel stock’s performance over the past four years has been highly volatile compared to the S&P 500. The stock returned 6% in 2021, -47% in 2022, 95% in 2023, and -60% in 2024. By contrast, the High Quality Portfolio has shown more stability while delivering superior returns. Why? These stocks tend to offer better performance with lower volatility, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
For long-term Intel shareholders who have weathered years of underperformance and heavy investments in the foundry business, this may not be the best time to exit. Transferring manufacturing to TSMC could mean missing out on a potential recovery, particularly as the CPU market shows signs of stabilization. Intel stock currently trades at about $27 per share, or just over 22 times 2025 consensus earnings—a valuation that appears reasonable. Our estimate for Intel’s fair value is also around $27 per share. For a deeper analysis, see Intel’s valuation.

One of the best Gen 4 SSDs on the market at one of the best prices

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

With taxes and tariffs taking a toll on the cost of new electronics, building a new PC is getting increasingly expensive every day. Gone are the insanely low NAND prices of 2023, and we may even be looking at a rise in memory prices going forward, so is now a good time to purchase a new SSD? Depending on what tasks you want the drive to perform, this Gen 4 SSD from Western Digital is still one of the best and fastest SSDs for productivity and gaming. You can, of course, step up to Gen 5, but for a 4TB drive, you will be paying a premium for not much of a real-world benefit, especially in gaming applications.
Just shy of $10 off the all-time-low price of this drive model, Western Digital's WD_Black 4TB SN850X with Heatsink is marked down to just $279 at Newegg when you use the $40 discount code SSEPA767 at the checkout. The previous list price for this drive is $319.
The WD Black SN850X features 112-layer BiCS5 TLC memory with a WD proprietary controller. This 2280 M.2 SSD is PCIe Gen 4x4 and can reach bandwidth-topping sequential read and write speeds of up to 7300/6600 MBps, respectively. The performance of the SN850X also means it easily meets the PlayStation 5 specifications checklist for use as a secondary storage option in the PlayStation 5 console. Plus, with its included heatsink, thermal throttling shouldn't be an issue.
WD Black SN850X (4TB) SSD with Heatsink: now $279 at Newegg with code (was $319)The SN850X is a speedy PCIe 4.0 SSD for PCs, laptops, and the PlayStation 5. The drive boasts a sequential performance that peaks at 7,300 MB/s reads and 6,600 MB/s writes. See our review of the WD Black SN850X for more information. This version comes with a heatsink shroud installed.  
Use code SSEPA767 for the $40 discount. 
We reviewed the WD Black SN850X and were very impressed with the drive's performance in our benchmark testing, rating it at 4 out of 5 stars and awarding it an Editor's Choice badge.

Southeast Asia‘s premium video-on-demand market saw robust growth in 2024, with total industry revenues jumping 14% to $1.8 billion and viewership hitting 440 billion minutes, according to fresh data from Media Partners Asia (MPA).

Netflix dominated the landscape with a 52% viewership share and 42% revenue share, while capturing nearly half of all new subscriptions in Q4. The company closed 2024 with more than 12 million subscribers across Southeast Asia’s five key markets.

	Indonesia emerged as the largest revenue generator at $552 million, followed by Thailand with $473 million. The growth story was primarily driven by strong performance in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia, which helped offset a minor slowdown in Thailand.

	The fourth quarter of 2024 proved particularly dynamic, adding 3.2 million new SVOD subscriptions and bringing the regional total to 53.6 million. Warner Bros. Discovery’s Max made a splashy debut in November 2024, snagging 26% of Q4’s new subscribers, particularly in Thailand. The service ended the quarter with over 1.4 million subscribers, with growth expected to accelerate in 2025 as new originals like “White Lotus” Season 3 roll out.




			Popular on Variety		






	While Netflix dominates, competition is intensifying. Local player Vidio led Indonesia with 4.7 million subscribers in 2024, while regional competitor Viu closed the year with 9.5 million customers. Disney+ maintains a solid 10% revenue share following service repackaging.

	Korean content continues to drive significant viewership, with shows like “Queen of Tears,” “My Demon,” and “Gyeongseong Creature” performing strongly on Netflix. U.S. content accounts for 20% of premium VOD viewership, while Southeast Asian and Chinese content are gaining traction, particularly in the freemium segment. Japanese anime remains popular, especially on SVOD platforms in Thailand.

	“Southeast Asia’s streaming landscape is evolving rapidly,” said Vivek Couto, executive director of MPA. “While Netflix has solidified its leadership position, the category is growing with the entry of Max and the scaling of local and regional platforms like Vidio, Viu and TrueID. The next phase of growth will be fuelled by the expansion of connected TV and home broadband penetration. Continued investment in local/Asian content and premium sports, led by Netflix and key local and regional platforms in Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia, will further stimulate growth. The industry is also exploring new strategies focused on short-form content and bundling partnerships to attract and retain subscribers.”

RTX 5080 stock coming sooner. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The RTX 5070 Ti is now officially available for purchase, assuming you can find it model in stock. Following the RTX 5090/5080 launch debacle, this much was expected and it doesn't take more than a few clicks at eBay to find scalpers selling a $749 GPU in the four-digit territory. OCUK, a large UK reseller frequently publishes updates of its latest GPU inventory at X (formerly Twitter). The latest report is that all RTX 5070 Ti models have been sold out, with restocks anticipated within two to six weeks. Other Blackwell GPUs are also impossible to find, though the restock estimates are slightly more generous than at launch.
The handful of MSRP models instantly flew off shelves as the embargo lifted and are nowhere to be found. Custom models that cost north of $900 were snapped up by eager enthusiasts or, most likely scalpers shortly afterward. The RTX 5070 Ti beats its predecessor in 4K gaming by around 25% per our testing. This isn't much in the grand scheme of things. For context, the RTX 4070 Ti led the RTX 3070 Ti by over 60%
Supply for the RTX 5070 Ti isn't as bad as high-end Blackwell at OCUK, given that pre-orders are still up and running. potential customers have been warned of long waiting times, possibly up to six weeks (early April). A handful of RTX 5080 units are arriving weekly with orders expected to be fulfilled in around three weeks which is an improvement over last time. To be fair, the reseller has no RTX 50 GPU in stock, which is a shame and could end up proving troublesome for Nvidia with RDNA 4 launching early next month.
Stock Update:RTX 5070 Ti sold out and pre-orders open.RTX 5080 sold out but limited stock arriving weekly.RTX 5090 sold out and pre-orders ceased. Stock ETAs are as follows:RTX 5070 Ti ETA: 2-6 Weeks.RTX 5080 ETA: 1-3 Weeks.RTX 5090 ETA: 2-14 Weeks.Pre-orders are being…February 20, 2025
Leakers have claimed that Nvidia is repurposing data-center-tailored GB200 wafers for the RTX 5090, expected to improve availability in around one month. We cannot verify the authenticity of this claim, especially given OCUK's up to 14-week ETA for the flagship card. You can probably imagine how the RTX 5070 will fare at launch, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.
AMD's updated nomenclature positions the Radeon RX 9070 XT as a direct competitor to the RTX 5070 Ti. With these GPUs retailing in early March, Nvidia has roughly three weeks to get its supply chain issues sorted out. This might lead AMD to set an otherwise high price tag for its GPUs. Let's hope that doesn't come to fruition lest AMD should jeopardize its market share ambitions this generation.

If you're looking for your next career move, standing out to hiring managers is the key to getting your foot in the door. However, in a tight job market, a strong résumé alone won't necessarily bring your application to the top of the pile.
Personal branding plays a critical role in how job seekers present their skills, experiences and values to potential employers. Here, 20 Forbes Human Resources Council members share their top tips for showcasing their unique personal brand to hiring managers.
In 2025, with AI automating job postings and CVs, authenticity is everything. Forget generic buzzwords and skip the generic fluff. Focus on sharing real stories, projects and experiences that show who you are. A short, genuine LinkedIn post or a well-chosen example in your cover letter can say more than a polished template. Less is more—be clear, be concise and be human. - Milos Eric, OysterLink
Job seekers need a story—a clear narrative that aligns with the roles they’re pursuing. It should highlight their experience, motivations and skills, connecting directly to the job or industry. Stories resonate with hiring managers and help candidates stand out. A well-crafted story is the most effective way to communicate value and make a lasting impression in 2025’s competitive job market. - Ariel Diaz, TalentMovers
In a competitive labor market, highlight not only your technical skills but also adaptability and cultural fit. Platforms like LinkedIn offer the ability to share projects and content through a portfolio developed by the job seeker. In industries like digital banking, it is beneficial to tailor your messaging to address a company’s unique business operations and showcase passion for its mission. - Julie Hoagland, Alkami
In today’s competitive market, standing out means ditching the experience-first résumé. While experience matters, leading with soft skills, quantifiable outcomes and even your passion projects is key to differentiating yourself. Take it up a notch by experimenting with GenAI tools to optimize your résumé to the role and spotlight these strengths so hiring teams see the unique value you bring. - Laura Coccaro, iCIMS
Don't worry about checking every box. Instead, focus on what differentiates you as a candidate (and, in turn, as an employee) and lead with that. Create an elevator pitch that sums up what makes you the right hire and communicate that clearly and concisely. - Caitlin MacGregor, Plum
Forbes Human Resources Council is an invitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. Do I qualify?
Stay relevant, authentic and unique. Focus on showcasing unique value through a strong LinkedIn presence, a tailored résumé and portfolio that highlight your achievements and impact. Authenticity matters—align your skills with the company’s mission and culture. Leverage AI tools to refine applications and prepare for interviews, ensuring you stand out as a well-rounded, adaptable candidate. - Ankita Singh, CIGNEX Technologies Private Limited
In artificial intelligence and an organizational focus on innovation, the ability to stay genuine is invaluable. Emphasize the power of emotional intelligence, your ability to bring solutions rather than problems and strong resilience: your focus on remaining mentally healthy under constant work pressure. Finally, always display self-drive, understanding different cultures and passion for people. - Dr. Nara Ringrose, Cyclife Aquila Nuclear
Reflect on what sets you apart from other candidates. Focus on your unique skills, experiences and qualities that are particularly valuable to the role or industry you're targeting with a blend of technical skills, soft skills, past achievements and personal values. - Britton Bloch, Navy Federal
In today’s time, social networks and industry organizations are a great way to promote your qualifications to others. Placing summaries of your background and accomplishments on social networking channels and participating in those organizations opens doors in a way that in-person conferences and networking events used to in pre-pandemic times. - Jalie Cohen, Radiology Partners
With 500 applicants per role, job seekers need to prioritize getting a recommendation from the hiring manager in order to cut through the noise. Once the door is open, job seekers must then tangibly demonstrate how their actions have directly led to P&L impact or success. Here’s recommendation for job seekers: Use an x, y, z methodology where x equals action, y equals metric change and z equals P&L impact. Simply put, they must embody positive growth. - Alex Cooke, Phase 3 Search
Focus on authenticity, skills alignment and impact storytelling. Be genuine about your values and how they align with the company. Tailor your résumé and LinkedIn to highlight relevant skills and quantifiable results. Share concrete examples of how you’ve made a difference. Lastly, personalize applications to show you understand the company’s needs and how you can address them. - Divya Divakaran, EVS, Inc.
To stand out in 2025's job market, articulate your unique value and align your online presence with your professional brand. Engage actively in industry discussions and network both online and offline. Use storytelling in your applications and interviews to vividly convey how your experiences shape your skills and professional approach. - Nicole Cable, Blue Zones Health
In 2025’s competitive job market, a résumé alone isn’t enough. Job seekers must focus on personal branding and showcasing their value beyond the page. Electronic and hard copy samples of work—at any level—tell a compelling story, transforming words into proof of ability. Pairing this with a strong online presence and targeted storytelling turns talking points into opportunities that resonate. - Eryn Mack, Mack Point Consulting, LLC
Be authentic and don't oversell. I would rather undersell than oversell to set the right expectations on both ends. Be candid; explain various challenges encountered and the way you handled them. Being in the HR field for decades, I would love to hear their experiences that demonstrate their attitude or reaction and their personality, which can create a brand in itself to convince the recruiters. - Prakash Raichur, Taghleef Industries
Networking is the key to breaking into this “hidden job market.” Job seekers in 2025 must craft a strong digital presence and a compelling value proposition. Use LinkedIn optimization, showcase achievements via quantifiable metrics and create content demonstrating expertise. Video résumés and AI-personalized applications will stand out. Authenticity plus strategic storytelling equals impact. - CJ Eason, JobFairGiant.com
In 2025, job seekers need to find innovative ways to stand out from the crowd. One practical approach is to create an online presence that showcases their skills and experiences while telling a personal story that resonates with potential employers and aligns with their values. Additionally, job seekers should tap into their networks and use social media to connect directly with employers. - Kevin Walters, Top DEI Consulting
Using AI-powered personal branding can give job seekers an edge in 2025. AI tools help analyze strengths and fine-tune résumés, cover letters and LinkedIn profiles for each role. These tools also provide insights into industry trends, allowing candidates to align their skills with future market demands. This approach not only personalizes applications but also demonstrates forward-thinking. - Laura Spawn, Virtual Vocations, Inc.
Sixty percent of your brand is based on what people say about you when you're not present. Harness this by following these tips: 1. Be genuine: Authenticity resonates, so stay true to yourself. 2. Showcase your expertise: To build credibility, share your knowledge and experiences. 3. Tell your story: Openly share your journey with real stories and data, including challenges and successes. - Teedra Bernard
Personal branding hinges on building a single presence across social media platforms. There is no individual and professional persona, just ""you"" and your consistent actions. Job seekers should focus on building genuine, mutually beneficial relationships. These authentic connections serve as a powerful “word of mouth” campaign to potential employers, opening doors to new opportunities. - Trevor Higgs, Catalyzr, Inc.
For those who are at the director level and above, this can be a challenge to do on your own. One effective approach is to hire an executive résumé writer. Partner with someone who will take the time to get to know you and have working sessions to understand what makes you unique, identify your zone of genius and approach your résumé like you are a brand that they are marketing. - Oksana Lukash"

Fitbit’s devices are widely regarded as the best fitness trackers on the market thanks to their premium build quality, wide range of health and fitness features, and impressive tracking accuracy. Although you can find plenty of cheaper alternatives on the market, none quite measure up to the Fitbit Charge 6 or the Inspire 3. If you’re a proud owner of one of these trackers, you’d be glad to know that Google is making them even better with a fresh software update.
The latest update for the Fitbit Charge 6, Inspire 3, Sense 2, and Versa 4 brings some quality-of-life and security improvements. As per the official changelog (via 9to5Google), it introduces new “status indicators” to the smartwatches and fitness trackers that appear at the top of the clock face when you turn on the device’s screen. The new indicators help you check whether do not disturb or sleep mode are enabled, if the device’s battery is critically low, or if it’s disconnected from your phone at a glance. Here’s what they look like.
Google’s support page notes that these indicators disappear after three seconds, but you can view them by swiping right and checking the icons at the top of quick settings. If you don’t like the status indicators and prefer not to see them when you turn on the screen, you can disable them by heading to the Display settings on your Fitbit device and unchecking the toggle next to the Status indicators option.
In addition to the status indicators, the update includes new Bluetooth security features for the Charge 6 and Inspire 3. To enable these features, Google recommends reconnecting your tracker to your phone. The Fitbit app will automatically prompt you to do so after you install the latest firmware on your fitness tracker."

Shares of Uber Technologies, Inc (UBER, Financial) have proved a disappointing investment over the past year. Uber shares have delivered a total return of roughly 4% while the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of roughly 22% over the same time period.
While the company has delivered solid results including impressive revenue growth and significant margin improvement, investors have become skeptical of the long-term prospects of the company due to the threat of autonomous vehicles. However, I believe the company is poised to benefit from autonomous vehicles over the long-run. Investing guru Bill Ackman appears to agree with this view and recently initiated a $2.3 billion position in the stock.
Uber shares currently trade at an above-market forward price to earnings ratio of 30x based on consensus full year 2025 earnings per share estimates. However, I believe the stock is undervalued given its strong growth prospects.
Uber is a technology company which operates platforms that connect consumers with providers of services. The company's largest business is its mobility business which accounts for roughly 52% of revenue. Uber's other key business is its delivery business which accounts for roughly 33% of revenue. Uber's freight business, which has struggled to generate profitability, accounts for the remaining share of revenue.
The company has operations in roughly 70 countries globally and derives roughly 50% of its revenue from the U.S. While Uber has been around since 2009 the company historically struggled to generate profitability. That has changed over the past year as Uber reported net income of nearly $10 billion compared to net income of just under $2 billion of net income for 2023. It is important to note is the $10 billion figure includes a $6.4 billion benefit related to a one-time tax revaluation. Even after backing out the $6.4 billion benefit, Uber's profit growth remains impressive.
Uber Operating Revenue by Business Segment
Over the past five years, Uber has grown its revenues at a roughly 28% compound annual growth rate. Growth has been strong in both the company's mobility and delivery segments. I expect this trend to continue going forward as the company is set to expand by increasing market penetration outside of the U.S. and in smaller cities within the U.S.
Uber Revenue and Net Income Chart
In addition to increasing market penetration in both its mobility and delivery business, I believe that Uber is also poised to see significant benefits from the adoption of autonomous vehicles. Currently, Uber has an operating partnership with Waymo in Phoenix and has announced plans to expand this partnership to Austin and Atlanta in 2025. One thing to note is that Waymo has been operating on its own, without a partnership with Uber, in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The fact that Waymo has decided to partner with Uber in new markets after operating previously without Uber in certain markets suggests that the benefits of being an option on the Uber platform exceed the costs related to sharing a portion of profits from each ride with Uber. For Uber, Waymo represents a significant growth opportunity as it will lead to additional supply of vehicles. Currently, limited supply of new drivers has proved a growth headwind for the company. In addition to providing additional supply, autonomous vehicles are likely to result in a lower cost to serve as autonomous vehicles do not require a human driver.
Another reason why I believe autonomous vehicles operators are likely to partner with Uber is the fact that there are likely to be multiple different autonomous vehicles options in the future. Elon Musk has said that Tesla plans to launch its own autonomous vehicles later in 2025. Amazon backed Zoox also plans to launch autonomous vehicles in the near future. Thus, it appears likely that multiple autonomous vehicles will be available in the next few years. The existence of multiple autonomous vehicle options on the market favors Uber because the company is uniquely positioned to be an aggregation platform where consumers can quickly and easily evaluate different options including traditional vehicle options with a driver. Uber is a highly valuable partner for autonomous vehicle providers as the scale of Uber's customer base results in more efficiency for autonomous vehicle operations that would be the case if they were operating on their own with a smaller customer base.
Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi commented on benefits that autonomous vehicle operates experience from being available through Uber during the Q4 earnings call:
Uber also recently announced a partnership with Nvidia to share data from its platform to help accelerate autonomous mobility. Currently, consensus estimates call for Uber to report revenue growth of 15%, 15%, and 14% for full years 2025- 2027. Consensus estimates for full year 2025 earnings per share call for a decline of 46% as full year 2024 earnings per share included a one-time positive impact of $6.4 billion due to a tax revaluation. Consensus earnings per share estimates for full years 2026-2028 call for the company to deliver earnings per share growth of 36%, 24%, and 19% respectively.
Bill Ackman recently announced that his Pershing Square Capital Management has acquired a stake of more than $2.3 billion in Uber. Ackman noted that he believes that Uber is a high- quality business that can currently be purchased at a massive discount to intrinsic value. Additionally, Ackman noted that he believes autonomous vehicles represent a major positive catalyst for the company rather than a disruptive force.
While I believe investors should always do their own work and come to their own conclusion, Ackman's backing is a clear positive. This is especially true given the fact that Ackman has a strong history of finding attractive growth at a reasonable price investments. Some of Ackman's notable successful growth investments include Chipotle Mexican Grill and Hilton Worldwide. Moreover, at more than $2.3 billion Ackman's Uber bet is now his largest position which suggests he has a high degree of conviction in the investment.
Uber currently trades at 30x consensus full year 2025 earnings per share and 22x consensus full year 2026 earnings per share. While this valuation represents a moderate premium to the S&P 500, Uber has much strong near-term growth prospects than the broader market.
Uber's closest publicly traded peers are Lyft and DoorDash which trade at 13x and 42x consensus full year 2025 earnings per share. Lyft trades at a significant discount due to its relatively small size and focus on the mobility business which is viewed as less attractive than the delivery business. Uber generates roughly 32% of its revenue from its delivery business with the bulk of the remainder coming from its mobility segment. Based on a blended peer multiple assuming a 32% weight on DoorDash's valuation and 68% on Lyft, Uber's peer valuation would be roughly 22x consensus full year 2025 earnings. While Uber's current valuation of 30x represents a premium to its blended peer valuation, I believe this premium is well deserved given the fact that Uber has larger scale than these rivals. Moreover, I also believe that in the long-run Uber will benefit from additional cross selling and economies of scale given its large presence in both the mobility and delivery markets. For example, Uber's R&D spend can be leveraged to benefit both its mobility and deliver businesses.
Uber's valuation also appears attractive vs other companies poised to benefit from the autonomous vehicle trend such as Tesla which trades at 124x consensus full year 2025 consensus earnings per share.
The biggest risk to the Uber bull case is that autonomous vehicle providers decide to circumvent Uber and go direct to consumer with large scale offerings. While I view this as highly unlikely given recent developments with Waymo and the fact that Uber has a massive customer base, it is not impossible. Such a development would be more likely to occur in the event that only one autonomous vehicle wins out in the end. Comparably, if there are autonomous vehicles offered by multiple players then Uber should be well position to be the platform of choice for consumers as it easily allows users to compare options.
Another risk to the Uber bull case would be if Lyft were to be acquired by a stronger player. For example, Amazon or DoorDash would appear to be a suitable buyer for Lyft and could create a platform with greater scale than is currently the case. Such a combination could result in more competition for Uber and thus lead to margin pressures in the future.
Uber shares have not kept pace with the broader market rally over the past year. The company has a strong history of delivering consistent revenue growth and has recently started delivering very strong earnings growth. The company is well positioned to benefit from secular growth trends going forward and has the potential to be a major beneficiary of autonomous vehicles.
The stock trades at a reasonable valuation relative to the broader market and peers. Moreover, the company has the backing of investing guru Bill Ackman, I believe the stock represents a compelling growth at a reasonable price investment opportunity."

Hilton is set to expand its Hampton by Hilton brand in India from a single property to 75 through a partnership with NILE Hospitality. This expansion leverages India's strong economic growth, burgeoning middle class, and undersupply of hotels. Hilton's strategy includes tapping into India's travel trends, such as religious tourism and the wedding market, to strengthen its presence and increase its market share in the region.
Hilton on Thursday signed an agreement with Indian hotel management company NILE Hospitality to introduce 75 Hampton by Hilton properties across the country.
There is currently just one Hampton by Hilton property in India, located in Vadodara. 
This expansion plan follows Hilton’s earlier agreement with Olive by Embassy for 150 properties under the Spark by Hilton brand.
Hilton currently operates five of its 24 brands in India. That is expected to grow to eight in the coming years as it adds Waldorf Astoria, Curio Collection, and other brands.
“We currently have 31 hotels trading in India with another 27 in the pipeline. This year we are on track to add another 6 hotels,” Clarence Tan, senior vice president, development, APAC, Hilton, told Skift.
 Tan said it is on track to grow to 10 times its current size in India over the next decade.
Hampton by Hilton is positioned in the upper-midscale segment, filling the gap between upscale Hilton Garden Inn and the Spark by Hilton, a premium economy brand. It aims to attract value-conscious yet quality-driven travelers.
The Hampton by Hilton hotels in India will open in Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Bihar.
Tan believes India is ripe for expansion due to three key factors:
“We believe the time is right for our focused service brands, but we also see opportunities to build out our full-service portfolio in key gateway cities,” Tan noted. Hilton’s recent DoubleTree by Hilton signings in cities like Bhopal and Varanasi reflects this multi-brand strategy.
“With economic growth driving infrastructure and the expansion of the middle class, coupled with an undersupply of internationally branded hotel stock, India is at a sweet spot for the hospitality industry,” Tan said.
Hampton by Hilton has seen significant success in China, expanding rapidly over the past decade. Tan attributes this to three factors: Strong local partnerships, consistent product and service quality and adapting to local consumer preferences.
Hilton is applying a similar approach in India. “We’ve conducted in-depth market and consumer research to shape our strategy,” said Tan. For instance, taking inspiration from India’s regional cuisines, the brand is looking to adapt its signature waffle to both savory and sweet options with plans for a chai flavored waffle.
India’s travel industry is booming, driven by business travel, leisure tourism, religious tourism, and weddings.
Religious tourism is a major factor, with events like the Maha Kumbh Mela expected to attract up to 600 million visitors, generating $500 million in lodging opportunities.
The wedding industry, second only to the U.S. in size, is projected to generate $70 billion in revenue this season alone, up from $50 billion last year, from 3.5 million weddings. Hilton has signed multiple hotels in wedding hotspots like Jaipur to capture this market.
“We’ll have to be in the right place at the right time, with the right brand to cater to these trends,” said Tan. The hotel company has also opened a DoubleTree by Hilton hotel in India’s spiritual capital, Varanasi. “Other religious hubs, such as Amritsar, Ayodhya, Dwarka, Puri, Shirdi, and Tirupati are expected to be growth regions for hotels,” he said.
Hilton is also focusing on customer loyalty in India through its Hilton Honors program, which already drives 60% of its global occupancy.
What am I looking at? The performance of hotels and short-term rental sector stocks within the ST200. The index includes companies publicly traded across global markets, including international and regional hotel brands, hotel REITs, hotel management companies, alternative accommodations, and timeshares. 
The Skift Travel 200 (ST200) combines the financial performance of nearly 200 travel companies worth more than a trillion dollars into a single number. See more hotels and short-term rental financial sector performance.

63,2025-02-20,"Oscar-winning actress Halle Berry has a new passion: menopause, a neglected area of medicine long in need of a little love. Doctors often downplay or fail to thoroughly treat the biological changes that trigger physical, emotional, and social shifts at midlife, and Berry is asking hard questions about why the medical community doesn't adequately address this important stage with patients. 
 Berry talked to TIME about her advocacy work and Respin, the new company she created to provide women with reliable and comprehensive information about menopause. 
The more I started to talk about what I was going through, I started to realize how other women were suffering and how little other women had. I started to see the need to continue efforts in Washington to get a bill passed with substantive dollars [for more research on midlife and more clinical trials for menopause]. I saw the need for more education.
I had no answers, no one to turn to. I was floored to find the dearth of nothingness in this space—and how little doctors knew. I thought I had the best doctors I could have.
We are working on the federal level to get the bill through, and working at the state level, too, with governors and leaders. We’re talking to them about what programs they might be willing to support in their states to support women.
It’s not really their fault. It’s not something that’s made important for them in medical school. But what I hold against doctors today is that now that we are out there talking about it—and screaming that women deserve better—they don’t go back to take it upon themselves to get an education. Every practitioner should know about the menopausal body. Women are living to their 80s, and menopause can start in your 40s. We spend half our lifetimes in it now.
Read More: Why It’s Time to Uncouple Obstetrics and Gynecology
If men went through this time of life in the same horrific way we do [with symptoms of hot flashes, night sweats, and mood changes], there would be lots of answers, research, and a lot of money raised to fund studies to help men live their best lives. But because we are women, we suffer sexism and ageism; when we get to this time of life, we’re expected to white-knuckle it and bow out gracefully. Because society told us our primary and best years are for childbearing, and all we are meant to do is make babies. When we are done making babies, we’re left to fend for ourselves. No one cares about us any more. 
We refuse to understand that menopause is a thing. It's a very important time in a woman’s life when she needs to be cared for and understand what is happening to her body so she can live her best life in the next 30 years. We haven’t acknowledged that, and that’s why we never support it with money.
There are so many ideas and information and misinformation swirling around. That’s why I created Respin. It’s a community for women to talk to each other and learn from each other. But there is also a health component with health coaching, nutritionists, and experts to talk about exercise and learning how the lack of estrogen and changing hormones affect our heart, brain, bones, and entire body. I felt like there was something really missing in the market for women in midlife.
Women can get whatever level of support and care they need. A woman in her 30s can get educated about menopause; a woman in perimenopause can get a health coach and devise a plan for her needs, whether that includes hormone replacement therapy or supplements, and a woman post-menopause can come for the services she needs, too. It all depends on where a woman is and what her needs are when she enters the community.
Read More: Menopause Is Finally Going Mainstream
That’s my next crusade. After I get the bill passed in D.C. for more research and clinical trials, I’m going to the universities and putting pressure on them, too. We need to help them understand why this is important and reimagine their curriculum to make menopause and midlife for women more than one chapter in medical-school textbooks.
And this isn’t just for gynecologists. This isn’t bikini medicine. Every doctor—every cardiologist, every neurologist, every general practitioner, every rheumatologist—should understand the effect that a woman’s loss of her hormones does to her body and every single one of her organs.
We women have to start demanding more. That’s who I am today: a woman demanding more. I am demanding more because we deserve more.

A new online tracker on the Department of Government Efficiency's website puts a dollar amount on the estimated savings from the DOGE effort to slash federal government spending at $55 billion.
But an NPR analysis finds the numbers don't add up.
The DOGE site's posts, reminiscent of a feed on the Musk-owned social media site X, say some savings come from sources like ""fraud detection/deletion"" and ""workforce reductions, programmatic changes, and regulatory savings,"" and state that the full disclosure of the unit's actions will take time.
""We are working to upload all of this data in a digestible and fully transparent manner with clear assumptions, consistent with applicable rules and regulations,"" the website reads. ""To get started, listed below are a subset of contract and lease cancellations.""
The doge.gov/savings page then lists a ""wall of receipts,"" DOGE's first major data release that initially claimed to show more than $16 billion in savings from ending contracts. After correcting an apparent clerical error, it now shows $8.5 billion.
An NPR review of the more than 1,100 contracts in that initial release finds that DOGE's ""maximally transparent"" calculations still overstate its estimated savings totals by billions of dollars.
 Loading... 
Of the DOGE list's initial claim of $16 billion in savings, half came from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) listing that was entered into the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) in 2022 with a whopping $8 billion maximum possible value.
According to a DOGE post on X, that number was a typo that was corrected in the contract database to $8 million on Jan. 22 of this year before being terminated a week later, and DOGE ""has always used the correct $8M in its calculations.""
But for much of this week, DOGE listed the outdated $8 billion for its savings claims while linking to the termination notice with the smaller ceiling amount.
Some time Tuesday evening, the DOGE link was changed to point at the original $8 billion entry, and on Wednesday morning, the site was revised once again to show $8 million in savings — but still linked to the larger, outdated claim. The site also continues to list $55 billion in total estimated savings — the $8.5 billion in alleged contract savings and another $46.5 billion with no specifically documented source.
Spokespeople for the White House and DOGE did not respond to multiple requests for clarification about the DOGE data and savings claims shared online.
 Loading... 
Others discrepancies in DOGE's representation of data are more technical: The ICE example is also one of many DOGE entries that is not actually a contract, but rather a different procurement method known as a blanket purchase agreement where the high maximum value acts as a sort of large line of credit for orders to be ""called"" against.
Since the agreement began in late 2022, ICE used it three times for work that totaled $3.5 million, for possible savings of $4.5 million – just over half of what the corrected DOGE data claimed.
Government contracting and budget experts say including those terminations in their estimates is one of many ways DOGE isn't sharing the complete picture of government spending and saving.
Just over half of the contracts touted by DOGE, accounting for $6.5 billion in alleged savings, haven't actually been terminated or closed out as of Wednesday, according to an NPR analysis of a federal government procurement database, even though the site's ""wall of receipts"" listed these items.
That includes a billion dollar IT support contract with the Social Security Administration that actually added $1.8 million in obligated spending and additional funding for a Forest Service project management contract worth up to nearly $30 million.
More than a third of the listed contracts posted online would not actually save any money if canceled, according to DOGE.
In all, estimated savings from the initial DOGE list of just over 500 contracts that NPR found to be cancelled runs closer to $2 billion, with roughly half coming from the gutting of the Department of Education, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the U.S. Agency for International Development.
The contracts DOGE has targeted at these agencies include ending research studies into early childhood education improvements, canceling access to financial market resources and the proposed halting of billions in international foreign aid work. To check DOGE's claims, NPR compared the unique award ID from each hyperlink DOGE published with a list of more than 130,000 contracts that have been modified since Jan. 20, downloaded from USASpending.gov, another public data source to review government spending.
""There's no doubt that these young people [Musk] has working for him are very intelligent coders, genius coders, but they're limited,"" retired senior contracting officer Christopher Byrne said, referring to DOGE team members who have apparently been identifying cuts across government agencies. ""They don't understand the processes, they don't understand how things work, they don't understand contracts, they don't understand grants,"" Byrne said.
Six other current and former federal contracting officers who spoke with NPR on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation say that the DOGE savings page is misleading the public with the data it includes — like overemphasizing the maximum possible value of contracts cancelled — as well as with what it leaves out, they say, like how much has already been budgeted and spent to fulfill the contract.
Jessica Riedl, a senior fellow at the center-right Manhattan Institute who studies ways to cut extraneous government spending, says DOGE is doing more harm than good to the government in how it has cut costs and shared them with the public.
""A smarter way to reform contracting would actually cost money in the short term,"" Riedl said. ""Because it requires audits, it requires analysis, building new systems, building new controls rather than just going through with a chainsaw and trying to cut contracts almost randomly."" 
Byrne, whose contracting career spanned more than 20 years and included work with the General Services Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Navy, says DOGE's website is also missing basic information needed to track and understand federal spending, like the ID number, what type of agreement or contract method was used and whether the cancellation was for some or all of the spending. Several publicly available data sources already track and confirm changes to federal contracts, including the Federal Procurement Data System, USASpending.gov and the System for Award Management (SAM). Unlike DOGE, those sources list other relevant data like the current value of the contract, historical changes to the amount budgeted and spent for the contract and when the contracts begin and end.
DOGE's savings page also does not include any evidence of fraud, waste or abuse in contracts, but does highlight ideological differences between the Trump administration and the previous priorities of former President Joe Biden.
As for contracts, Byrne said the discrepancy in DOGE data shows why information being entered into those systems by the government needs better validation and standardization to be more transparent.
He added that shortcomings with the current training, staffing levels and processes among contracting officers could be exacerbated by potential retirements and firings in coming months under the Trump administration's plan to downsize the federal workforce.
""There are not the people available to do the job, to do it well,"" he said, ""which is going to lead to more wasteful spending.""
Even government contracts that have been terminated before reaching their full value could end up costing taxpayers more to settle up. Jessica Tillipman, associate dean for government procurement law studies at The George Washington University Law School, previously told NPR that the termination for convenience clause used for many of these cancellations is expensive.
""When the government terminates a contract for convenience, it's still obligated to pay for the work completed,"" she said. ""This doesn't eliminate the government's responsibility for paying these sorts of costs.""
Riedl with the Manhattan Institute also says that the only way for the federal government to cut spending and reduce the deficit is through meaningful — and difficult — changes enacted by Congress, and not DOGE creating a ""false perception"" that finding ""waste, fraud and abuse"" is enough to get there.
More than 60% of the $6.8 trillion the federal government spent last fiscal year was mandatory spending on popular programs like Medicare, Social Security and income security programs — spending that would require major legislative reforms to substantially reduce.
NPR's analysis found that, of its verifiable work completed so far, DOGE has cut just $2 billion in spending — less than three hundredths of a percent of last fiscal year's federal spending.
""Think of Congress and its budget as the debt-ridden dad on the way to buy a $250,000 Ferrari on the credit card, and DOGE is the $2 off gas card he used along the way,"" Riedl said. ""It's great that he saved $2 on gas, but I think his wife may be more concerned about the $250,000 car.""

65,2025-02-20,"What just happened? Nvidia has announced a new initiative to provide fans with a chance to purchase the highly coveted and very scarce RTX 5090 and 5080 Founders Edition graphics cards. The program, dubbed ""Verified Priority Access,"" offers a select group of enthusiasts the opportunity to acquire these elusive two-slot, small-form-factor-friendly GPUs by filling out an online form. 
This latest iteration of the Verified Priority Access program differs from its predecessor, which was used for the RTX 4090 release, as the previous version was invitation-only and based on pre-selection.
To be eligible for consideration, applicants must have an existing Nvidia account created before January 30. The application process includes specifying a preference between the RTX 5090 and 5080 models. Nvidia will then employ an algorithm to assess the authenticity of each applicant's gamer status, likely by analyzing their usage patterns of Nvidia applications and GeForce Experience.
The company has stated that invitations will begin to be distributed next week. However, Nvidia has not disclosed the number of graphics cards allocated to this program, making it difficult to gauge its effectiveness in getting these components into the hands of genuine gaming enthusiasts rather than scalpers.
Successful applicants will be limited to purchasing only one graphics card through this channel.

While this program represents a novel approach to graphics card distribution, its impact on the wider availability issues plaguing the high-end GPU market remains to be seen.
The launch of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5090 and 5080 graphics cards has been marred by severe scarcity, leaving many enthusiasts frustrated and empty-handed. This shortage, which began on the release date, has persisted for weeks, with retailers struggling to maintain stock and prices soaring well above MSRP.
Best Buy, a primary seller of Founders Edition cards, saw its entire stock of RTX 5090 FE cards sell out within minutes of launch. Similarly, Newegg's inventory of RTX 5080 AIB cards was depleted within seconds, leaving customers staring at ""out of stock"" notifications almost immediately after the cards went live.
The situation wasn't much better in other regions. In the UK, retailer Overclockers reported having only ""single digits"" of RTX 5090 cards in stock, with RTX 5080 units numbering in the ""few hundreds."" This scarcity led to extreme measures in some markets, including Japan, where a retailer resorted to selling lottery tickets for the chance to purchase an RTX 5080 or 5090 on launch day.
Several factors have contributed to this shortage. Nvidia itself warned of ""significant demand"" for these cards prior to launch, anticipating potential stock-outs. The company cited manufacturing challenges, including delays related to the Lunar New Year, which coincided with the launch period.
Another contributing factor is the cards' appeal beyond the gaming market. The RTX 5090, in particular, has garnered interest from smaller AI companies for use in training large language models, further straining the already limited supply.
The scarcity has led to a thriving scalper market, with some offering ""guaranteed"" slots for RTX 5090 GPUs at prices more than triple the MSRP. This has made it even more challenging for genuine enthusiasts to acquire the cards at reasonable prices.

Host your very own Squid Game event--and keep everyone alive--with this nice deal on the official board game adaptation.
By 
    Darryn Bonthuys
   on February 20, 2025 at 3:03PM PST
If you've ever wanted to enjoy a few rounds of IRL Squid Game at your home--and with far fewer casualties--you can now check out a great deal on the officially licensed board game. Normally $25, you can pick up Squad Game: The Board Game for just $18.49 thanks to an Amazon Lightning Deal, but you'll want to be quick. Once all available stock has been purchased, it'll revert back to its original MSRP.
The Squid Game tabletop adaptation follows the basic premise of the Netflix show. Players vie for the $38 million prize--metaphorically that is--by competing in up to six mini-games like Tug of War, Glass Bridge, Marbles, and Red Light/ Green Light. Designed for up to six people to play, the first person to reach the Squid Head will win big in this twisted take on survival of the fittest. Like the Squid Game TV series, surviving players will get to split the money earned up to that point, so it's in your best interest to keep your teammates alive so that you have a numerical edge over the opposing team.
Each session lasts around 45 minutes, so this is a nice way to enjoy a quick round of Squid Game and not worry about being possibly betrayed by a trusted friend. Each of the six games features unique playstyles and rulesets, so you'll want to adapt quickly if you want to avoid being eliminated.
In addition to the official board game, Netflix also collaborated with Spin Master Games on an official set of marbles. If you feel like playing a game of chance, the Squid Game marbles gift set is $15 at Amazon.
If you're looking to add a creepy collectible to your shelf, you can also take a look at this $107 replica of the Young-hee Doll that made the first challenge in Squid Game so memorable.
Just like the massive automaton used in the Red Light/ Green Light game, this one features a motorized rotating head and it broadcasts key sounds from that scene, in case you want to play the game at home. Fortunately, heavily armed troopers scanning the playfield for any signs of movement are not included.
The Young-hee Doll is also part of the Squid Game x The Woobles crochet collection, though the doll is more cute than creepy as a tiny yarn plush.
Squid Game fans who feel like spending some serious cash on an uncannily accurate replica of protagonist Seong Gi-hun, Hot Toys recently revealed a sixth-scale figure of the reluctant Squid Game participant.
Based on his appearance in season two of the show, it looks almost identical to actor Lee Jung-jae and it comes with multiple accessories. Priced at $280, it's expected to ship out by June 2026.

67,2025-02-20,"Cruise operator stocks are sinking Thursday after a top U.S. official pledged to force them to pay taxes. 
While speaking with Fox News on Wednesday evening, newly-confirmed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested the federal government would order a crackdown on taxes paid by cruise operators. 
“You ever see a cruise ship with an American flag on the back? They have flags of like, Liberia or Panama,” he asked. “None of them pay taxes. Every supertanker.”
 “This is going to end under Donald Trump and those taxes are gonna be paid,” he added. 
Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL-2.07%) stock fell almost 10% on Thursday, while Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH-5.49%) shares tumbled 7%. Carnival Corp. (CCL-1.97%) stock dropped 6%, Viking Holdings shares declined 4%, and Lindblad Expeditions (LIND-1.26%) shares fell by more than 3%. 
Cruise companies have flourished in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, benefiting from pent-up demand for travel. Royal Caribbean last month blew past Wall Street’s estimates for its latest fiscal quarter, noting that it “continues to be encouraged by the demand and pricing environment.”
They’ve also historically benefitted from loopholes that allowed them to avoid paying corporate taxes, even while they took advantage of U.S.-funded resources. Cruise companies often choose a “flag of convenience,” meaning that they register their ships with countries that have more lenient laws, even while being headquartered in the U.S. 
Royal Caribbean and Norweigian are both based in Miami, Florida, but are incorporated in Liberia and Bermuda, respectively. Carnival Corp. is also based in Miami, but is incorporated in Panama.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 launch has been a rather sorry episode for Nvidia, due to demand far exceeding supply, on top of issues with scalpers - but fortunately, Team Green is taking action to give genuine buyers a better chance of getting one of these high-end GPUs at their recommended prices.
As spotted by Wccftech, Nvidia has brought back its Verified Priority Access program, a scheme that allows a limited number of gamers (or indeed creators) in the US to purchase the RTX 5090 or RTX 5080 at MSRP by completing a form to indicate their interest.
The only stipulation is that people need to have an Nvidia account (that was created on or before January 30, 2025), and note that this only offers the chance to purchase Nvidia's own Founders Edition versions of the graphics cards.
You may remember that Nvidia introduced this scheme with the RTX 4090 and eventually the RTX 4080 too, after these GPUs were launched.
Considering the still very limited supply of high-end Blackwell GPUs, this will likely prove highly beneficial for would-be buyers. It's a struggle to find anything near MSRP at all, and third-party RTX 5090 and 5080 graphics cards (meaning GPUs not from Nvidia) which can be found on sale cost far more than their recommended pricing. Of course, this scheme won't help you buy such a third-party board, only a Founders Edition GPU.
While this priority access scheme is not going to completely turn the tide of the battle against scalpers, it'll surely help in that fight. If a scalper doesn't already have a pre-existing Nvidia account, they'll be out of luck, as creating a new one to get onto the scheme won't work (due to the mentioned January 30 deadline).
This is similar to Valve's move with the Steam Deck, where the initial pre-orders were limited to those with a Steam account that had been created in the previous year (and had made a purchase).
Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.
While Nvidia's priority access scheme is only in the US for now, hopefully it'll be expanded beyond that to other regions in the future.

Nvidia's GPUs are always highly sought after upon launch, seemingly regardless of how well any new GPUs are received by gamers, and we're seeing that again with Blackwell graphics cards. This inevitably introduces two main problems in terms of scalping and inflated prices - with the end result being that very few gamers are lucky enough to snag a new card, and they end up paying far too much for that privilege.
The Verified Priority Access scheme gives gamers a better chance of buying a powerhouse GPU, and what's more, they get it at a fair price - the MSRP, in fact. So in my opinion, this must be part of Team Green's sales strategy going forward (at least while stock woes persist).
Scalpers may still find ways to manipulate the system, especially if accounts were made before the January 30 deadline. However, there is no guarantee that those who fill in a form will get a chance to purchase, and Nvidia is 'verifying' any applicants to hopefully weed out any dubious would-be buyers. Plus each account is still limited to one purchase only.
As I've stated, this isn't going to benefit all potential buyers as there are caveats involved (notably that the scheme is restricted to US buyers only), but it's definitely a step in the right direction.

According to a new report by Reuters, Apple has informed the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) that the remedies proposed by the agency could potentially stifle innovation in the mobile browser market and might lead to a wastage of the company's resources.
The face-off between Apple and CMA was sparked in 2022 when the watchdog, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority, launched a probe into the Apple and Google duopoly in the mobile browser market. The agency's allegations suggest that these tech giants are creating barriers for rival browsers to compete and innovate.
In Apple's case, the CMA alleged that the iPhone maker abuses control over the ecosystem by forcing other developers to use its browser engine, WebKit. The move potentially prevents third-party developers from offering new features or making their products more power efficient.
In response, Apple has taken steps to allow developers to build browser apps based on their own browser engines and has given users the freedom to choose their default web browser from a range of options. Meanwhile, the UK's CMA has proposed that any new feature Apple adds to its WebKit should be available to other developers for free.
Apple is now alleging that it would ""not be appropriate"" to let third-party developers access WebKit's new features for free as it takes a lot of resources and time to develop these features.
""Apple cannot recoup a reasonable amount of those expenses ... to do so would have a chilling impact on Apple's incentives to innovate and would lead to free-riding and underinvestment on the part of third parties.""
Apple might have a valid point here. While third-party developers can now build apps based on their own web engines, expecting Apple to let them access WebKit for free is more like an extravagant wish. It remains to be seen how CMA will respond.
What do you think? Should Apple make new WebKit features available to others for free?

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Apple's long-anticipated Vision Pro AR glasses showed great promise at launch, but the iPhone maker has failed to live up to the hype. For instance, the company deterred many users from buying the entry due to its steep $3,500 price tag, seemingly limiting its accessibility to high-income markets.
The sophisticated augmented reality headset is riddled with a wide range of issues, including health concerns like eye strain and cognitive fatigue, design flaws (particularly its bulkiness), and limited app support from developers, which makes the $3,500 entry less appealing outside of its novelty.
Be that as it may, the hype around the expensive headset has quickly faded as affordable and more multi-functional entries like XREAL's AR glasses join the fold. However, a new report suggests that Apple might be attempting to make a comeback with the Vision Pro via AI-powered features (via LaptopMag).
According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple plans to ship its AI (Apple Intelligence) to the Vision Pro, an updated mode for guest users, and a spatial content app to potentially spark user interest and drive more headset sales.
The AR headset will reportedly receive the highlighted improvements via a new update, visionOS 2.4, which is slated to ship as early as April. However, developers may gain access to these new features this week.
While Apple has yet to confirm any of the highlighted details, if true, Apple Intelligence will ship with a wide range of features to the Vision Pro, including Writing Tools, Genmojis, and the Image Playground app.

Apple played safe with generative AI until October 2024, when it unveiled its Apple Intelligence strategy. Interestingly, Apple Intelligence hasn't hit its prime-time yet, as it continues to ship in waves for iPhone 15 users and higher or Macs with M1 chips and higher.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
Apple's iPhone sales have seemingly declined over the past few years, especially in the Chinese market. It's unclear if Apple Intelligence's debut has helped improve these figures in the grand scheme of things. It will be interesting to see if this theory proves successful for the Vision Pro.
This news comes weeks after Microsoft confirmed it was handing over the development of its military IVAS hardware and software to Anduril Industries, potentially dumping the $22 billion deal to the third-party developer if the deal pulls through.
Last year, the Redmond giant pulled the plug on its Windows Mixed Reality platform and stopped developing HoloLens 2.

      India’s stock markets have taken a beating, the BSE Sensex having come down by more than 10,000 points from its peak last September. The broader market has fared worse, as the sharpest slide was in small-cap stocks, less severe in mid-caps and relatively modest among big companies. 

     
      While weakening market indices disappoint millions of investors, especially those who joined the action in recent years, this is not a disaster. It reflects neither a fundamental problem with our economy, nor any structural flaw in capital markets. 

     
      Rather, this correction represents the squeezing out of excess. 

Also Read: Mint Quick Edit | An earnings let-down adds to the bearish trendFour factors had conspired to inflate equity prices: one, an influx of external liquidity arising from easy-money policies aimed at pandemic relief in the rich world; two, investor funds diverted to India by economic problems in China and some other emerging markets; three, euphoria over India’s growth prospects, stoked by last year’s election outcome; and four, a structural shift in the saving behaviour of our middle class, which swung away from the safety of bank deposits to embrace equities, either directly or via mutual funds. 

     
      The resultant deluge of money pushed stock prices way above levels justified by their price-earning multiples.

     
      The first three elements of that combination have petered out and our stock market has sobered up. Is that such a bad thing? If we set aside the sentimental hope that stocks offer a one-way ticket to easy riches, this pullback is welcome. The function of capital markets is to allocate financial resources efficiently among various sectors. Inflated equity prices result in capital being misallocated.

When shares trade at sky-high multiples of annual earnings per share, it shows that people are buying them without looking at business prospects, but in the hope that a ‘greater fool’ would buy them at even higher prices, letting them make a quick buck. 

     
      Once this becomes a larger trend, companies find they can raise much more money than what’s warranted by their ability to generate value. In the process, money gets diverted away from businesses that may better deserve funds. Irrational exuberance, thus, gets in the way of what’s best for the economy. For funds to find their way to investment avenues that deploy it well, overpriced shares are a hindrance. We are better off with stock tickers going red if it expels the excess.

     
      At what point will post-correction market prices be judged reasonable again? On average, the BSE’s LargeCap index may have reached that level, going by prices as a ratio of earnings, while its SmallCap index still looks too high and MidCap index less so. The important part is whether quick-buck investors have begun to view stocks the way they should—as investments with varied risk-return profiles, rather than mere casino-style punts.

The UK Competition and Markets Authority highlights BCD and Amex GBT as leading players in the corporate travel market, overshadowing CWT. The CMA's interim report on Amex GBT's planned acquisition of CWT suggests the deal won't substantially impact competition, despite CWT's financial challenges. Most travel management companies experienced growth in transaction volumes from 2023 to 2024, except for CWT, which saw a decrease.
Travel management companies are notoriously secretive about contract wins, but the UK Competition and Markets Authority shared the broad outlines of which companies are competing for and winning the most corporate travel transaction volumes.
""The bidding data confirms that BCD and GBT are the two strongest competitors in the market, by far, and has also led us to provisionally conclude both are substantially stronger than CWT,"" the CMA stated.
The findings were part of an interim report released Tuesday on Amex GBT's pending $570 million acquisition of CWT. The regulator provisionally concluded that the deal wouldn't reduce competition, but it will release a final decision by March 9.
The report also noted the financial weakness of CWT, which declared bankruptcy in 2021. 
And it found that FCM is a smaller, but material competitor in the corporate travel contract bidding process.
Two other travel management companies, CTM and Navan, also compete against the larger players for global corporate travel contracts worth more than $25 million, the report found, and both won market share in 2024 versus 2023.
The CMA described a fairly competitive marketplace in corporate travel.
Using data from Amex GBT about bidding processes it was involved in from 2021-2023 for global corporate travel contracts with total transaction volumes worth at least $25 million, the CMA found that: 
Using data from CWT about bidding processes it was involved in from 2021-2023 for global corporate travel contracts with total transaction volumes worth at least $25 million, the CMA found that:
The report also took a looked at travel management companies' total transaction volumes for 2024 versus 2023, and found that Amex GBT, BCD and FCM all saw 10-20% increases. However, Navan's total transaction volume jumped 30-40% while CTM's climbed 40-50%.
Of those travel management companies mentioned, only CWT saw a decline in 2024 versus the prior year. Its total transaction volume dipped 0-5%.
CWT's waning prospects are a chief reason the CMA is likely to approve the acquisition – the authority doesn't see the acquisition as dampening corporate travel competition.
A U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit to block the merger would still stand in the way of the deal's consummation.

76,2025-02-20,"Above-target US inflation and a strong labor market reflect robust economic fundamentals. But the biggest risks to the US economy’s continued growth are Donald Trump’s erratic communication and, perhaps more importantly, his populist trade and immigration policies.
 WASHINGTON, DC – As investors, business leaders, and policymakers consider America’s economic outlook, two things should be front of mind. First, the US economy is very strong. And, second, President Donald Trump’s populist policies pose one of the biggest risks to its continued growth. 
 In January, core consumer-price-index (CPI) inflation (excluding food and energy prices) rose by 0.4% month on month – more than economists had expected, and double December’s increase, pushing the year-on-year rate to 3.3%.  
 Financial markets took note. But it has been clear for months that the Federal Reserve is not succeeding in pushing inflation toward its 2% target. Underlying inflation has been stuck since the spring of 2024. Using the personal consumption expenditures price index (excluding food and energy prices), year-on-year inflation was either 2.7% or 2.8% in seven of the last eight months. (It was 2.6% in June.) And 12-month core CPI inflation has been either 3.2% or 3.3% in each of the last eight months. 
 Meanwhile, the labor market is holding steady. The headline monthly unemployment rate has remained between 4% and 4.2% since May, and has been falling for the past two months. In fact, the labor market may be tightening. A broader measure that accounts for involuntary part-time schedules and marginal labor-force attachment implies that slack in the labor market may have been falling since July. 
 An inflation rate stuck above the Fed’s target and a strong labor market reflect robust economic fundamentals. Monthly employment gains have been strong and layoffs remain low, supporting household incomes and the consumer spending that has fueled the economy’s expansion. Economic output grew above its underlying potential in the second half of 2024. At the time of writing, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates that the economy is on track to grow 2.3% in the current quarter, arguably above its sustainable rate. 
 The risk of inflation reaccelerating is greater than the risk of labor-market deterioration. As I write, market prices imply a 16% chance that the Fed will not cut rates again in 2025. While investor expectations have been moving in the right direction in recent months, the odds of a rate hike – which in my view is likely this year – are still being downplayed. 
At a time of escalating global turmoil, there is an urgent need for incisive, informed analysis of the issues and questions driving the news – just what PS has always provided.

 What could slow the economy? Trump’s erratic policy communication and, perhaps more importantly, his populist trade and immigration policies. 
 To be clear, much of what Trump hopes to achieve will strengthen the US economy. As I wrote recently, the president’s approach to artificial-intelligence regulation and antitrust enforcement, and his desire to expand domestic energy production, reduce corporate taxes, and roll back harmful regulations will boost growth. Investors largely agree – the S&P 500 has increased by around 6% since Trump’s victory in November. 
 But Trump has also sowed confusion about the future path of US economic policy, particularly concerning trade. US mergers and acquisitions were down nearly 30% in January 2025 compared to January 2024, reflecting this unpredictability. Consumers, too, are starting to show signs of nervousness. The University of Michigan’s index of consumer sentiment fell by 5% in February. 
 To be sure, since the pandemic, consumers have been as down on the economy as they typically are during recessions. But February’s decline in consumer sentiment seems to be related to inflation concerns. The Michigan survey showed a large month-on-month jump in median 12-month inflation expectations, from 3.3% to 4.3%. Notably, consumers in the Michigan survey were particularly gloomy about buying conditions for durable goods, which suggests anxiety about tariffs. 
Research by economists Olivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, and Michael Weber shows that Americans expect to pay nearly half of the costs of any tariffs that Trump enacts. And a different survey found that two-thirds of Americans do not think Trump is doing enough to lower consumer prices. Tariff fears and the potential for higher prices could lead consumers to cut back their spending, slowing the current expansion. 
 While the uncertainty caused by Trump’s erratic policy communication is harmful, following through on his populist policies would be much more damaging. Trump’s first-term trade war increased consumer prices and reduced business investment, manufacturing employment, and competitiveness – without meaningfully cutting economic ties with China or lowering the trade deficit. 
 Goldman Sachs estimates that a sustained 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico – which Trump announced on February 1 but then almost immediately paused for 30 days – would reduce economic output by 0.4%. A study published by the Peterson Institute for International Economics finds that GDP will fall by 1.2% by 2028 if Trump deports 1.3 million illegal immigrants. 
 Trump was elected largely because voters rejected Joe Biden’s approach to economic policy, which had inflationary consequences. Given the US economy’s underlying strength, Trump has begun his second term with the wind at his back. He should build on this advantage by pursuing his many policy goals that would boost growth, rather than those that would impede it.

During the postwar era, Germany's traditional parties worked to establish an economic model that balanced markets with the need for rules to limit economic power. If they want to end their country's economic malaise and help prepare Europe for the future, they would do well to revive the social market tradition.
“There’s a new sheriff in town,” declared US Vice President J.D. Vance at this year’s Munich Security Conference. With his boss, “Sheriff” Donald Trump, openly disparaging America’s longstanding security commitments and actively undermining European security, the United States can no longer be trusted, and it is up to Europe’s leaders to bolster the continent’s defense capacity – and fast.
Incoming Germany Chancellor Friedrich Merz is an unlikely candidate to lead a decisive break with the United States. But an erstwhile über-Atlanticist and fiscal conservative might be the only German politician who can credibly bury the country's economically disastrous ""debt brake"" and pave the way for a truly independent Europe.

Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, the third graphics card in its newest 50-series generation, officially went on sale this morning… and less than an hour after it became available, it’s out of stock in every US online store. You might have more luck if you try to get it at physical retailers like MicroCenter, but I wouldn’t bet on it.At the time of writing, I’m unable to put any card in a shopping cart at Best Buy, Newegg, or B&H. If Amazon has any cards available, I haven’t found them… but I’m sure resellers will have listings up on there soon, as well as on places like eBay, for vastly inflated prices. That’s on top of the already-high prices for OEM card designs, since Nvidia isn’t making its own Founder’s Edition.
The same thing happened a few weeks ago with the launch of the RTX 5080 and 5090 cards, despite sky-high prices. Then, as now, a combination of factors seems to have led to an even more frustrating launch than usual with new high-powered hardware. There’s pent-up demand two years after the RTX 40-series debuted, AI companies are gobbling up GPU supplies, and Nvidia seems to have unusually low supplies of the latest cards. Some retailers are projecting restock waiting times of weeks or even months.
Then, throw in the usual scalpers and retailers trying to make a quick buck off of a hot item, combined with inflated prices for OEM cards with enhancements of questionable utility. Not to mention both manufacturers and retailers bumping up prices for both the usual reasons and the ongoing trade war demanded by the Trump regime. It’s a perfect storm of gotchas for PC gamers.
We’re still waiting to hear the details of AMD’s Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT cards, which should be competing with the RTX 5070 and 5070 Ti, respectively. Hopefully AMD will try to beat Nvidia on price as it cedes ground at the top of the market. There’s also news of RTX 5050, 5060, and 5060 Ti cards on the horizon, not to mention Intel showing off some impressive performance at the entry level for its second-generation Arc discrete graphics cards. 
But there’s no getting around it. If you demand a new, high-end Nvidia card, you’re either going to have to spend a lot of money (even more than they already cost), spend a lot of time tracking one down, or be very, very fortunate. Probably a mix of all three.

78,2025-02-20,"Why enterprises must embrace an AI-first strategy that unifies endpoint, identity and network security within a zero-trust framework."
79,2025-02-20,"
					By Nancy Tartaglione 
International Box Office Editor/Senior Contributor

	Continuing its wild run, Chinese blockbuster Ne Zha 2 has become the highest-grossing animated film of all time worldwide, surpassing previous record holder Inside Out 2. It also now sits as the No. 8 movie overall on the global chart.

Ne Zha 2 topped Inside Out 2‘s $1.699B global on Wednesday with $1.7B from just the home market (factoring in the markets that released last weekend, that rises to about $1.71B). Through the close of Thursday’s business, NZ2 is at RMB 12.47B ($1.72B) in China, per Maoyan.

	Note that while Chinese ticketing platforms have been including the next day’s presales to calculate NZ2 milestones on a rolling basis, Deadline is not including presales and are using full-day reported estimates as of the end of each business day.

	










			Watch on Deadline		






	The projected final in China has been adjusted slightly downward, to RMB 15.1B ($2.08B), which would see Ne Zha 2 edge Star Wars: The Force Awakens’ global tally to land it at No. 5 on the all-time chart. 

RELATED: ‘Ne Zha 2’ Review: Chinese Blockbuster Is Visually Engaging, But Its Elaborate Plot Is A Challenge

	In the meantime, the next film currently above Ne Zha 2 in the worldwide rankings is Spider-Man: No Way Home with $1.95B at No. 7 (anecdotally, that movie never released in China). And above that is Avengers: Infinity War at No. 6 with $2.05B.

	Should NZ2 get to $2B in China, it would be the first time a film reaches the benchmark in a single market. The movie has been given an extended run in China and will stay in cinemas until March 30. It is releasing in Hong Kong this week.

	Earlier records set by the film from director Jiaozi include becoming the highest-grossing movie ever in a single market worldwide, the first movie ever to cross $1B in a single market and the first non-Hollywood movie to join the billion-dollar club.

Every year, we stock up on a variety of cat-friendly seafood snacks, crank up a custom gotcha day jam, and throw a little celebration in honor of our feline overlords. After an enthusiastic (and probably off-key) singing session, we present them with their seafood feast and remind them—yet again—how much we love them and how much better our lives have been since they joined the family.
For the original poster (OP) of today's featured story, celebrating 12 years of feline bliss meant pulling out all the stops with a JCPenney photoshoot—because why not commemorate the occasion with a touch of glamour? The theme? Valentine's Day. And let's just say, this dynamic duo knows how to steal hearts! Dressed to impress and working their angles like seasoned pros, this cat dad and his purrfect feline absolutely nailed their celebratory photoshoot.

The Nintendo Switch 2 may be around the corner, but if you still want the original console, this new bundle is a solid option.

 Nintendo Switch OLED - Super Mario Bros. Wonder Console Bundle 
 $350 
Nintendo has released a new Switch OLED bundle featuring one of the console's best exclusive games: Super Mario Bros. Wonder. The bundle costs $350--the same price as the Switch OLED on its own--so you're essentially getting a digital copy of Nintendo's superb side-scrolling platformer for free. Mario Wonder still regularly sells for its full $60 MSRP. As an added bonus, the bundle also comes with a 3-month Switch Online individual membership ($8 value).
The Super Mario Bros. Wonder Switch OLED bundle is available now at Best Buy. We expect other major retailers, with the exception of Amazon, to stock the bundle soon.
Nintendo typically only releases new Switch console variants or bundles during the holidays and alongside big game launches--such as the Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom-themed Switch Lite that launched last year. But with the Switch 2 slated to launch later this year, it makes sense that Nintendo would bundle the Switch with Mario Wonder to help move existing units.
The bundle includes the Switch OLED with Neon Red/Blue Joy-Con Controllers. A Mario-themed console would have been cool--ideally with Elephant Mario's face on the front of the dock--but hey, at least the colorful blue box features the game's cover art.
If you're new to the Switch platform, Super Mario Bros. Wonder is as good of a first game as any. The 2023 platformer offers an imaginative spin on the classic Super Mario side-scroller formula. It introduces multiple new gameplay features, including Mario's Elephant power-up and Wonder Flowers, which dynamically alter your surroundings in fun and creative ways. It earned a 9/10 in our Super Mario Bros. Wonder review.
Mario Wonder is just one of many great Switch exclusives Nintendo has released over the past eight years. If you want to pair your console bundle with another game or two, Best Buy has great deals on a handful of other Nintendo hits. The list includes the best-selling Switch game of all time, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, as well as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Check out more Switch game deals below:
Nintendo Switch Game Deals at Best Buy:
It's worth noting that the Nintendo Switch 2 will support backward compatibility with original Switch games, so all of the games mentioned here will be playable on the new console. More Switch 2 details will be unveiled during a Nintendo Direct stream on April 2. For now, check out our roundup compiling everything you need to know about the Switch 2.

82,2025-02-20,"Pi Network, the smartphone mining project that claims to have 60 million users, released its native PI token Thursday giving traders a roller-coaster ride that saw the price rise 18% in minutes before tumbling 50% over the next two hours.
PI debuted at $1.70 at 09:00 UTC, rising to as high as $2.00. It was recently trading at $0.97. The initial surge sent the fully diluted value (FDV) to as high as $195 billion — almost double the value of the Solana blockchain's SOL.
The FDV is based on the maximum supply of a token, 100 billion in this case. The self-reported circulating supply is 6.3 billion, putting its market cap at around $6.1 billion.
Pi Network has drawn comparisons to viral projects from previous cycles including SafeMoon, which also attracted a retail audience with aggressive marketing and referral schemes. 
In order for users to begin mining the Pi token on a mobile device, they must first receive an invitation from another user. They are then issued with an invite code they can share themselves. More tokens are rewarded for each referred user, creating an ecosystem that mirrors multilevel marketing (MLM) or pyramid schemes.
The project has been around since 2019 with its testnet going live in 2020. The token release marks start of the Pi Network mainnet, which means that all accrued tokens can be transferred and traded.
However, exchanges currently lack sufficient liquidity to handle the billions of tokens being traded. In fact, even the most-liquid exchange, OKX, has a 2% market depth of between $33,000 and $60,000. That means an order of, say, $100,000 would move the price significantly, creating a volatile trading environment.
Market depth measures the amount of capital required to move an asset in either direction. Based on the token's market cap, a 2% move would equate to a $146 million shift in the project's value.
Pi Network has attempted to remedy a disparity between buyers and sellers by offering holders a ""lock-up"" period, which can be up to three years. If holders opt to lock up their tokens, they will receive higher mining rewards. A similar approach was employed by Richard Heart's controversial HEX token, which lost more than 99% of its value between 2021 and 2024, rendering many of the locked tokens worthless.
Oliver Knight is the co-leader of CoinDesk data tokens and data team. Before joining CoinDesk in 2022 Oliver spent three years as the chief reporter at Coin Rivet. He first started investing in bitcoin in 2013 and spent a period of his career working at a market making firm in the UK. He does not currently have any crypto holdings.

83,2025-02-20,"After months of rapid expansion, Bitcoin’s hashrate growth slowed down in January, according to the latest report from TheMinerMag. 
The network’s difficulty saw its first decline since September, indicating that even though publicly listed companies have kept increasing their hash power, their growth isn't enough to compensate for the capitulation of other, probably smaller operators.
The total revenue made from bitcoin (BTC) mining remained stable at $1.4 billion for the month. Publicly traded mining companies, which collectively hold 99,000 bitcoin (worth roughly $9.7 billion), accounted for about 30% of the hashrate market share in January.
Competition between the biggest publicly traded companies has also increased.
The leading mining firm, Marathon Digital (MARA), retained its top spot with a realized hashrate of 41.65 EH/s, followed by CleanSpark at 34.77 EH/s. Riot Platforms, which has been expanding aggressively, is closing in with 31.27 EH/s.
“Notably, the competition within the 30 EH/s group is heating up like never before, while the gap between the 30 EH/s tier and the 10 EH/s group — comprising Core Scientific, Cipher Mining, and Bitfarms — continues to widen,” the report said.
The top miners taking more market share is hardly a surprise as the recent halving event has cut bitcoin mining rewards by half and squeezed the industry's profit margin, even with the BTC price near $100,000. In such an environment, it's tough for smaller players to compete with big operations which were already positioned to dominate the market. In fact, a lot of miners are already looking for other revenue sources, such as hosting machines for AI and HPC firms. 
Read more: Bitcoin Halving Is a 'Show Me the Money' Moment for Miners
The report also said that mining hardware imports to the U.S. also slowed in January, a factor contributing to the stabilization of hashrate growth. However, some firms, including Blockchain Power Corp and AcroHash, have imported a significant amount of cooling infrastructure from Bitmain.
Looking ahead, TheMinerMag predicts another difficulty adjustment decline in February as some smaller mining operators exit the market due to lower profitability.

vivo Android In for review Featured

vivo unveiled the V50 earlier this week at an event in New Delhi, India, making it vivo's first big launch of 2025. The vivo V50 is yet to go on sale, but we've received the phone for review, so let's take a quick look at what it has to offer before we put it through our review gauntlet.
The vivo V50's retail box looks identical to its predecessor's - the V40. It includes some documents, a SIM ejector tool, a charging cable, a power adapter, and a protective case.
The vivo V50 is built around a 6.77"" FullHD+ quad-curved AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 4,500 nits peak brightness. The screen is protected by Diamond Shield Glass and has HDR10+ support.
The display has a punch-hole for the 50MP selfie camera (with auto-focus) and a fingerprint scanner underneath for biometric authentication. We found the fingerprint scanner to be fast and accurate in the short time we spent with the phone; however, we would have liked it to be placed a bit higher for better reachability and a more convenient phone-unlocking experience.
Moving on to the back, we have a camera island that doesn't look all that different from what we had on the V40. What also remains the same is the number of cameras. We've got two rear cameras on the vivo V50 - 50MP primary (with OIS) and 50MP ultrawide (119˚ FOV). The primary camera uses the OmniVision OV50e sensor, while the ultrawide and selfie cameras use Samsung's ISOCELL JN1 sensor.
The rear cameras are joined by a circular flash called Aura Light, which can change its intensity and color temperature to let you take pictures in different conditions. You can set it to auto or adjust it manually.
It's also worth noting that all three cameras on the vivo V50 come with ZEISS optics, and thus, you can click portraits with the primary camera using different ZEISS bokeh effects and at three focal lengths - 23mm, 35mm, and 50mm. Additionally, the vivo V50 comes with an India-exclusive Wedding Portrait Studio feature, which lets you click portraits in three different portrait styles - Prosecco, Neo Retro, and Pastel.
Under the hood, the vivo V50 has the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 SoC with up to 12GB of LPDDR4X RAM and 512GB of UFS 2.2 storage. The smartphone runs Android 15-based Funtouch OS 15 out of the box and will receive three Android OS upgrades and four years of monthly security updates. vivo has kept the bloatware to a minimum, at least on the Indian unit, which came with only five pre-installed third-party apps (Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn, Netflix, PhonePe), and they all can be uninstalled if you want.
The vivo V50 is IP68 and IP69-rated, and it packs a 6,000 mAh battery with 90W charging support. The smartphone also features dual stereo speakers and has three color options in India - Titanium Grey, Rose Red, and Starry Night.



vivo V50 Starry Night • vivo V50 Titanium Grey
The Titanium Grey model weighs 189g and comes with a plastic back cover, while the Rose Red and Starry Night versions weigh 199g and feature glass backs. Some countries will also get a Purple-colored model, which, too, weighs 199g.
We'll begin working on our vivo V50 review soon, so stay tuned to find out if it's worth buying.
Or else, how can they milk Snapdragon 8s Elite more by releasing an underclocked version of it with a 7+ afformative? 
And its only meaningful plus over most of the other smartphones on its level is the front camera (the sensor, tuning and optimization overall) 
Any midrange worth its coin has good battery life. A better processor means the phone can simply be used for longer. Upcoming competitors of this phone will have better batteries (GT 7T, Nord 5) so what then? The only major point is lost? You seem to...

85,2025-02-20,"NVIDIA's ultra-powerful RTX 5070 Ti graphics card is getting driver support despite being out of stock while games like Marvel Rivals and Indiana Jones are getting DLSS 4 support.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

NVIDIA has announced that its long-awaited GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is now available for purchase online. In addition, NVIDIA is releasing the latest GeForce Ready Driver update so GeForce users can add the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti to their PC systems.
In addition, NVIDIA will enhance the graphics and framerates of several games using its patented DLSS 4 technology. These games include Marvel Rivals, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and Delta Force: Black Hawk Down. Also, NVIDIA will add DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation to Legend of Ymir, Like a Dragon: Yakuza in Hawaii, and Lost Records, Bloom & Rage.

For those unaware, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is NVIDIA's latest graphic card and one of the most powerful it has produced to date. This PC component can enrich the graphical fidelity and framerate performance of the best PC games to new heights of high-quality gaming thanks to its Fifth-Gen Tensor Cores, Streaming Multiprocessors, Fourth-Gen Ray Tracing Cores, FP4, and DLSS 4.
The DLSS 4 is a key part of the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti as this latest iteration of NVIDIA's Ai-Suite is what allows the graphics to greatly boost the framerate and resolution of PC games without causing latency issues. (You can check out our NVIDIA DLSS primer for more detailed information on how it works).
For action-packed games like Like a Dragon: Yakuza in Hawaii, Marvel Rivals, Indiana Jones, and the Great Circle, this feature will sweeten their image quality while making them more responsive to play during intense moments where player reaction times are needed most.
The popular competitive PvP Hero shooter Marvel Rivals will especially enjoy the benefits of the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, making the fast-paced gameplay even more responsive while being gorgeous to look at. The performance improvements from this graphics card could potentially bring in more players to join the game's 40+ million player base (an achievement confirmed by NetEase) and make it more financially successful.
However, Marvel Rivals' future is currently in question as its developers have been laid off by NetEase so it's uncertain if the game will survive long enough to reap the benefits.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
Then again, it's doubtful if the general public will get to experience using this graphics card at the moment as it's confirmed that the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti already sold out in mere seconds. Plus, its MSRP is currently sitting at $749.99, which is pretty steep even by the standards of the best PC graphics cards, so unless you're mega-rich, you won't be buying this GeForce RTX 5070 Ti anytime soon.
But if you have the cash but want alternative premium graphic cards to fill the void until the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is back in stock, you can check out our reviews for the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080 and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 to see if they meet your high PC gaming needs.

87,2025-02-20,"British designer Craig Green has a keen eye for experimental fashion that reimagines menswear through reconstructed, often padded, materials that reshape classic silhouettes into all-new forms. 
He's also really good at finding collaborators who enhance his distinctive vision.
Green’s link-up with ECCO.kollective, the high-end line of the 60+-year-old Danish footwear company, personifies this knack, and it makes sense on both a creative and technical level.
Green’s ECCO shoe collaboration debuted during his Spring/Summer 2025 presentation. At face value, the muted lace-up moccasins and slip-on boots, available at Dover Street Market, simply reinterpret ECCO's Joke shoe, a throwback silhouette popular in ‘80s Britain right around the time that Green was born.
""ECCO's approach to functionality and leather innovation is something I find really inspiring,"" Green tells Highsnobiety. 
The collaboration felt like a ""natural fit,"" he says, since the pair share a similar shoe design dogma: ""We both explore craftsmanship in ways that push materials to new extremes."" 
But despite their muted color palette and unassuming silhouette, there’s more than meets the eye when it comes to Green’s ECCO moccasins. 
These shoes are the first to ever utilize ECCO's “Super Critical CO2” dying technique, a new process that reportedly reduces the chemicals and water consumed by conventional leather dyeing.
It’s appropriate that Green, the avant menswear designer, is the first to bring Ecco's innovative dyes to market, though the method is still being developed and perfected. As such, the final product didn’t come out exactly as expected. Still, this unpredictability, Green says, is a part of the fun.
The ""dye technique allowed for a level of depth and accidental color outcome that was almost impossible to plan,” he explains. “But that is the beauty of this process.""

88,2025-02-20,"Digital asset marketplace Figure Markets has launched YLDS, the first yield-bearing stablecoin registered as a public security offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company said Thursday.
The YLDS stablecoin, issued through Figure Certificate Corporation, operates on the Provenance Blockchain and accrues interest daily, paid out every month in either U.S. dollars or YLDS tokens. It is backed by the same securities as prime money market funds and pays holders a return at an annual rate of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) less 50 basis points. 
The token can be transferred peer-to-peer and exchanged for dollars or other stablecoins around the clock, with fiat off-ramps available during U.S. banking hours.
Stablecoins mushroomed to a $200 billion asset class and are increasingly popular for payments and cross-border transactions. However, market-leading stablecoins like USDT and USDC don't generally pay out holders the yield earned on reserve assets, predominantly U.S. Treasuries. That's where tokenized versions of money-market funds or investment strategies like BlackRock's BUIDL, Franklin Templeton's BENJI or Ethena's USDE enter the market: They are increasingly used as collateral or to park on-chain cash to earn a yield.

Figure Markets is the digital asset arm of Figure Technologies, a company co-founded by Mike Cagney, the former CEO of SoFi. The firm has played a key role in blockchain-based real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, processing over $41 billion in transactions and originating $11 billion in home equity line of credit using the Provenance Blockchain. Figure filed paperwork to the SEC to launch a yield-bearing stablecoin offering in October 2023.
The company expects YLDS to attract interest from developers looking to integrate stable, yield-bearing digital assets into decentralized finance (DeFi) and payment applications.
“We see tremendous applications for YLDS,” Figure Markets CEO Mike Cagney said in a statement. “Exchange collateral, cross-border remittances and payment rails are immediate opportunities, but this is just the beginning of a larger shift of traditional finance to blockchain.”

89,2025-02-20,"Server racks in a data center.
The fortunes of the billionaire cofounders of DCI Indonesia—Otto Toto Sugiri, Marina Budiman and Han Arming Hanafia—climbed over $2 billion in the past week as shares of the country’s top data center operator surged to record levels amid increasing demand for cloud computing and artificial intelligence.
DCI shares jumped 20% on Thursday to 67,225 rupiah ($4.1), hitting the upper limit of allowable daily share price fluctuation for the second consecutive day. That brings this week’s gains to about 47% as investors snapped up the shares amid optimism earnings will continue to grow as the company scales up its digital footprint across Indonesia, one of Southeast Asia’s hottest data center markets.
""We like the fundamentals of the company but the valuation is expensive,"" said Harry Su, managing director of Samuel Sekuritas Indonesia.
The rally boosted the net worth of Sugiri, DCI’s largest shareholder, by $939 million to $3.1 billion, according to Forbes’ real-time data. Budiman added $707 million to $2 billion, while Hanafia gained over $444 million to $1.5 billion, the data showed.
With the company becoming the Jakarta bourse’s most expensive with a current market cap of $9.8 billion, DCI is considering a stock split to make the stock more affordable. ""We are still reviewing,” said Sugiri, the company’s president director.
Founded in 2011, DCI has grown to become Indonesia’s biggest data center operator with a total capacity of about 83 megawatts currently. The company has been building an additional capacity of 36 megawatts since last year, which will come online in the first half of this year, making DCI Indonesia the first data center player with a capacity of over 100 megawatts, according to research by Samuel Sekuritas Indonesia published in September.
Among its multiple facilities across the country is an 18-megawatt data center that went live in South Jakarta in December 2023. Jointly developed with the Salim Group, the 11-story structure is equipped with 4,000 racks across an area of 30,000 square meters. Billionaire Anthoni Salim is also a shareholder of DCI.
Sugiri told Forbes Asia the company is continuing to expand and expects total capacity to reach 128 megawatts by early next year. The company is also investing 1.2 trillion rupiah ($72 million) to building a 9-megawatt facility in Surabaya, nearly 800 kilometers east of Jakarta.
With global tech giants Amazon, Google and Microsoft scaling up their digital footprint in Indonesia, DCI’s business has grown exponentially in recent years, posting a record profit of 514 billion rupiah in 2023, up 40% from the previous year.
DCI doesn’t disclose who their tenants are due to confidentiality agreements. Of the four cloud computing vendors operating in Indonesia—Alibaba, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud and Microsoft—three are clients, as are some of Southeast Asia’s largest e-commerce companies, according to the company It also counts among its clients over 40 telecom firms and more than 120 financial services providers across Indonesia, Southeast Asia and the U.S."

91,2025-02-20,"I grew up in the town of Lexington, Massachusetts, the self-styled “birthplace of American liberty,” and my first summer job was giving tours of the Battle Green. I would plunk my tricorne hat atop my head and meet the incoming waves of visitors, herding them around the Common and telling them the story of the April morning in 1775 when brave townspeople made their stand against the British and their king in the first fighting of the Revolution. Eight of those men died that day because they wished to rule themselves; as the Declaration of Independence put it the next summer, all men are equal, and that to secure the rights they are due “governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.” By legend, John Hancock—a target of the British raid on Lexington—signed the document in script large enough that King George could read it “without his spectacles.”
Democratic self-rule was a novel construct at the time, and it appears it may be tending back toward novelty again. On Wednesday, Donald Trump’s official White House social-media account sent out a picture of him wearing a crown; as he proclaimed on his Truth Social page, “Long Live the King.” It is a mug’s game to respond to every trollish provocation that Trump provides, but this one can’t pass with the day’s news. If America has a founding idea, that idea is “no kings.” Since the colonists didn’t have one close at hand, they couldn’t dethrone him, but the new nation took pains to insure that a monarchy would never arise. George Washington, who could have been a king, set the tone by abdicating after two terms, a precedent followed by all his successors until F.D.R., under wartime exigency, broke it. But Congress, led by a unanimous Republican caucus, quickly adopted the Twenty-second Amendment to—in the words of the 1940 G.O.P. platform—“insure against the overthrow of our American system of government.” In the long history of our civil religion, an American President declaring that he was a king would have been roughly equivalent to the Pope cheerfully tweeting out the news that he was now the Antichrist.
The LedeReporting and commentary on what you need to know today.
Trump, though, has long flirted and teased with the idea that he might want more than two terms in office, and he has never been shy about regal imagery. Consider the famous photo that showed him with his wife and young son in Trump Tower. The boy was astride a giant stuffed lion, with toy limousines scattered on the floor beneath him; Trump himself sat on a gilded throne. But it’s in the early weeks of this second term that he seems to have fully embraced the concept that he rules instead of governs. He has been issuing diktats—the Gulf of Mexico has a new name of his choosing—and sending his regent, Elon Musk, out to usurp the spending power of the Congress. Last week, he proclaimed that “he who saves his Country does not violate any Law,” which might as well have been “L’état, c’est moi.” Wednesday’s declaration that he was indeed a king came attached to a ruling that New York could not control its own traffic laws, announcing an end to what has been by most accounts a highly successful Manhattan experiment with congestion pricing. That this violates every Republican notion about the rights of states and localities is no matter; Trump clearly considers himself the mayor of New York (easy to do, since he last week ordered the Justice Department to drop all charges against the current occupant of that office, though the charges could be refiled if Trump’s bidding isn’t done).
It’s not clear whether Trump’s fiat on congestion pricing will hold—like many weighty issues, it now rests with the courts. But it’s also not clear whether Trump will allow the judiciary to overrule him; in any event, the deeper question is whether Americans will let him get away with his self-coronation. On Monday, across the country, groups of people marked Presidents’ Day with demonstrations against his blitzkrieg—the one I attended, in the whistling cold of Middlebury, Vermont, featured several signs proclaiming “No Kings,” and one placard showing the entire Gettysburg Address with its insistence that “government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth” underlined. Still, those protests were relatively small, and they must compete with an energized right wing, including an evangelical Christian vanguard that asserts that Trump rules by divine right. As his newly appointed leader of the White House Faith Office, Paula White-Cain, once put it, any Christian who didn’t vote for Trump would have to “answer to God,” a sentiment that seems to have worked its way into the President’s thinking after he survived an assassin’s bullet. Before the assassination attempt, he told the National Prayer Breakfast earlier this month, “I believed in God, but I feel, I feel much more strongly about it.”
Trump’s sense of his own royalty helps explain at least some of the bewildering changes of recent days. The United States appears to have abandoned its support of Ukraine, as its top foreign-policy officials scramble to the monarchy of Saudi Arabia to cut deals with the Russian tsar; kings favor other kings. In one of those ironies that history delights in, it’s the United Kingdom that has taken up the cause of Ukraine most vociferously, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer reiterating his support for Volodymyr Zelensky after Trump’s bizarre lie that Ukraine had “started” the war. Britain, with its tamed king, was one of the very few places where last year’s anti-incumbent tide swept committed democrats into power; Starmer’s Labour Party likely has four years left on its mandate, and it may well be a redoubt of the faith in the rule of law, not men. Perhaps the Trumpian example will convince at least a few others—polling in Canada, where the Tories fled after the Revolution, seems to show a drop in support for that country’s own demagogue in upcoming elections; Vice-President J. D. Vance’s shout-out to the far right in Germany may be backfiring as well.
But back home, who knows? This past election seemed to be a referendum more on the price of eggs than the price of freedom; one winces to recall Ben Franklin’s proclamation that “those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety, deserve neither.” (Also, the price of eggs is soaring.) My ancestors have been in this country since before the Revolution, Appalachian stock; I have spent my life imbued with that Lexingtonian sense that we want no king. But in our present moment I think that it’s likeliest to be recent immigrants who still viscerally crave the American promise of liberty; in so many cases, they came here to escape arbitrary rule. That many of them now hunker down in their homes against Trump’s raids doesn’t change the fact that they understand what America stands for. Or stood for. ♦

With the rapid emergence of generative AI, the world is rapidly evolving as more people and organizations hop onto the bandwagon. A recent study published by Microsoft researchers suggested that an overreliance and dependence on AI-powered tools like Copilot and OpenAI's ChatGPT might make you dumb.
The researchers attributed their findings to the tools' negative implications on a person's critical thinking, leading to the deterioration of cognitive faculties. However, more trouble seemingly looms on the horizon with AI's rapid advancement and broad adoption across the world.
In a recent interview with Patrick Collison, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates detailed four ""scary things"" the next generation should be worried about.
According to the philanthropic billionaire:
""There's, you know, about four or five things that are very scary, and the only one that I really understood and worried about a lot when I was young was nuclear war. Today I think we'd add climate change, bioterrorism/pandemic, and keeping control of AI in some form. So, you know, now we have four footnotes.""
Bill Gates has openly discussed the highlighted areas of concern in the past, particularly nuclear war during his youthful days.
While there have been multiple reports indicating there's a 99.999999% probability AI could lead to existential doom, Gates believes the technology could help bridge the intelligence gap in society.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
We don't have as many medical experts, you know, people who can stay on top of everything, or people who can do math tutoring in the inner city. And we have a shortage of intelligence, and so we use this market system to kind of allocate it. AI, over time — and people can argue about the time frames — will make intelligence essentially free.
Interestingly, Bill Gates is optimistic that if the highlighted issues are addressed, the future looks bright for the next generation.
""Alzheimer's, obesity, you know, we'll have a cure for HIV, we will have gotten rid of polio, measles, malaria,"" added Gates. ""'The pace of innovation is greater today than ever.""
Related: Bill Gates says AI will replace humans for most things
While Gates' predictions might seem a tad over the top and outrightly scary, he believes it might be the motivation the next generation needs to ensure that it can steer clear of those issues.
""They'll actually, to some degree, exaggerate the likelihood and maybe the impact of some of those things in order to activate people to make sure we steer clear of those things.""
Elsewhere, Bill Gates has also raised concerns about generative AI potentially claiming his job while simultaneously presenting a 3-day work opportunity as the technology would lessen the burden by taking over repetitive tasks at the workplace, allowing employees to focus on critical matters.
Tesla CEO and billionaire Elon Musk seemingly echoed Gates' sentiments, claiming AI would claim jobs from humans. He further argued that the world would evolve into a utopian society where work would be deemed a hobby.
It'll be interesting to see how generative AI impacts our lives in the long run and whether we'll be able to beat the alarming odds stacked against us by using the technology to unlock new heights and scientific breakthroughs.
