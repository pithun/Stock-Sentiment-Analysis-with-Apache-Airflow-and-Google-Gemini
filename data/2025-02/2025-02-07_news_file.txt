1,2025-02-07,"Pinterest does not make headlines very often, but the social media platform beloved by Midwestern moms claims to have more active users than X or Snapchat, and is the latest company to sound off on the issue of DEI. The social media platform told investors in a recent filing spotted by TechCrunch that its efforts around diversity, equity, and inclusion could result in harm to Pinterest’s business if they are âare perceived as insufficient or overdone,” and that the company âmay be subject to investigations, litigation, and other proceedings.â
Companies across the spectrum have been dropping their DEI initiatives as President Trump has used his executive powers to target the initiatives. Meta, Google, and Amazon are among the tech giants that have eliminated or watered down their DEI programs and wiped clean their websites of any language relating to the practice. Other corporations like Apple, Costco, and the NFL have kept their DEI commitments in place. Having a monopoly in an industry helps.
Proponents of DEI have long argued that having a workforce comprised of individuals from diverse backgrounds can result in better business performance as companies create products or services that appeal to all demographics. Tech industry insiders often have a blind spot for the ways in which their products can be used to harass women, for instance, and having women represented on staff can help ensure potential issues are identified early in product development.
Critics, however, say DEI programs have unfairly disadvantaged caucasian men, and that ideological diversity is more important than intrinsic qualities like skin color or race. DEI, as far as they are concerned, is discriminatory and gives jobs to people who do not otherwise deserve them. Ironically, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz earlier this week hired Daniel Penny, the former U.S. Marine acquitted for choking an unhoused man to death on the New York City subway, despite his lack of experience or qualifications in the field of investing. Virtue signaling is okay for me, not for thee.
While companies like Tractor Supply and Harley Davidson have been easy targets for anti-DEI campaigners, it does not seem likely that Pinterest will face the same scrutiny. The company’s userbase skews heavily young and female, a demographic more likely to value DEI at work. A right-wing, masculine culture like the one Mark Zuckerberg aims to foster at Meta does not seem to align with Pinterest’s audience.
Still, vibes across Silicon Valley are shifting, and Pinterest could nonetheless be targeted by activists who have begun to argue that prioritizing DEI risks a negative impact on business fundamentals. As a public company, Pinterest has an obligation to do what is in the best interest of shareholders, and some believe DEI results in companies not hiring the best possible talent. Pinterest has not yet released its diversity report for 2024 and has pared back its mentions of DEI in more recent annual filings. The company employed an officer overseeing DEI, Nichole Barnes Marshall, but LinkedIn indicates she left the company in November of last year.
On Thursday, Pinterest reported its earnings for the final three months of 2024, with its stock surging 20% after it exceeded expectations with revenue of $1.15 billion for the quarter and earnings of $470 million. To put that in context, the Wall Street Journal reported recently that under Elon Musk, X saw $2.7 billion in revenue and $1 billion in earnings for all of 2024. Pinterest makes most of its money from “promoted pins,” allowing users to buy products they see directly through the app.
Pinterest is in somewhat of an enviable position. It is not constantly the subject of scrutiny or derision like other social media companies and just seems to cruise along printing money and minding its own business. The pinboard service is a calm, relaxing place to find inspiration for the furnishings for a new apartment or plan a wedding reception. Pinterest is being cautious by disclosing to investors that DEI initiatives could put it at risk, but “anti-woke” activists likely do not have the company on their short list of targets. Do not come for sweet, innocent Pinterest.

2,2025-02-07,"Apple continues to have no close competition in the tablet market, earning 42.3 percent of the global tablet market share in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to a new report from Canalys.
Apple shipped an estimated 16.9 million iPads during the quarter, up from 14.8 million in Q4 2023. The company's closest competitor was Samsung, with 7 million tablets shipped in Q4 2024 for 17.8 percent of the market. Lenovo, Huawei, and Xiaomi were third, fourth, and fifth, respectively.
For all of 2024, Apple shipped an estimated 57 million iPads for 38.6 percent of the market. Apple shipped over twice as many tablets as Samsung in 2024, with Samsung shipping just 27.8 million.
Apple refreshed its high-end iPad Pro with an M4 chip in 2024, plus it revamped the iPad mini with an A17 Pro chip and added an M2 chip to the iPad Air. In 2025, Apple plans to refresh the low-cost iPad and update the ‌iPad Air‌ yet again.

3,2025-02-07,"Given today's bombshell report revealing the UK government's unprecedented demand for backdoor access to encrypted iCloud data, it's clear that Apple now faces a massive challenge. How it responds could have major implications for not only the company's privacy stance, but also its global operations as well as its reputation.
According to The Washington Post, the British government has secretly demanded that Apple give it blanket access to all encrypted user content uploaded to iCloud. The spying order reportedly came by way of a ""technical capability notice,"" a document sent to Apple ordering it to provide access under the sweeping UK Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) of 2016.  
According to sources that spoke to the publication, Apple is likely to stop offering encrypted storage in the UK as a result of the demand. Specifically, Apple could withdraw Advanced Data Protection, an opt-in feature that provides end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for iCloud backups, such as Photos, Notes, Voice Memos, Messages backups, and device backups. 
In this scenario, UK users would still have access to basic iCloud services, but their data would lack the additional layer of security that prevents even Apple from accessing it. In other words, UK users' iCloud data would revert to standard encryption, allowing Apple to potentially access the contents of said data if it is compelled to do so by UK authorities when a warrant is issued. Although no specific instance has been publicly confirmed, the IPA grants UK security agencies the legal framework to request data from companies when it is accessible.  
Apple could always pursue legal challenges. However, according to the IPA, while the company can appeal the ""technical capability notice,"" it must comply with the order during the appeals process. Apple would be forced to temporarily implement the backdoor while arguing against its legality. Not only that, the IPA makes it a criminal offense to reveal that the government even made the demand. 
Needless to say, such a gag order would prevent Apple from being up front with its customers about the security changes. When a backdoor is introduced — even if its purpose is to grant law enforcement access — it creates an alternative route into a secure channel. This not only increases the risk that bad actors might discover and exploit the vulnerability, but it also breaks the promise of complete confidentiality. Apple would essentially be lying to its customers about the watertightness of its E2EE security.

A more dramatic response from Apple would involve completely removing iCloud services from the UK. While this would protect Apple's encryption standards, it would severely disrupt millions of UK users who rely on iCloud for photo storage, device backups, and document syncing. Users would need to find alternative cloud storage solutions and potentially lose access to years of accumulated data.
Theoretically, Apple could attempt a technical workaround by restructuring iCloud to isolate UK user data. However, the IPA allows British authorities to compel tech companies to assist with data access regardless of where that company is based, so this solution might not satisfy the government's demand for worldwide access. It would also require costly engineering resources to implement, not to mention set a concerning precedent for other countries seeking similar arrangements.
""I don't see how this is to be resolved, as Apple has made such a big point of privacy for users,"" said Alan Woodward, a professor of cybersecurity at Surrey University, speaking to BBC News. ""If they accede to this technical notice their reputation will be in tatters. They're bound to challenge it.""

The UK's demand could also put the government's data-sharing agreement with the European Union at risk. The two regions currently have an agreement allowing the free flow of personal data between the EU and UK, but the arrangement faces review this year. The creation of an encryption backdoor could be viewed as violating the EU's strict data protection standards.
The spy order has already raised concerns in Washington, placing Apple in a potential diplomatic crossfire. According to The Post, the Biden administration first began tracking this issue since the UK first indicated it might demand backdoor access. 
The timing is particularly awkward, given that US security agencies have recently been advocating for increased use of encryption to combat Chinese cyber threats. In December, the FBI, the National Security Agency, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency jointly recommended that companies ""ensure that traffic is end-to-end encrypted to the maximum extent possible"" to protect against state-sponsored hacking. Creating a backdoor for UK authorities would directly contradict this guidance and could weaken US cyber defenses, potentially forcing Apple to choose between complying with UK law or protecting US national security interests.
It's worth noting that Apple has repeatedly and forcefully opposed creating backdoors in its products. In its March 2023 submission to UK Parliament, the company stated plainly: ""We would never create a backdoor in our products."" This echoes CEO Tim Cook's firm stance during the 2016 San Bernardino case, where he declared, ""Apple has never built a backdoor into any of our products and never will."" 
The company doubled down on this position in its 2024 submission to the UK Parliament regarding changes to the IPA, warning that the provisions ""could be used to force a company like Apple, that would never build a back door into its products, to publicly withdraw critical security features from the UK market."" 
Apple's core principle that ""privacy is a fundamental human right"" is a position it has consistently maintained through the years in the face of government demands for weakened encryption. Confronted by the UK government's latest encryption demands, the company must now prove whether its commitment to user privacy is truly unbreakable, or just a corporate slogan that crumbles under regulatory pressure.

4,2025-02-07,"That's nearly 30% off the Sony WH-1000XM4!

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

If you've been following my work for a while, you'll know that I'm a big fan of Sony's WH-1000XM4 headphones, and I will jump on the chance to recommend them every time a new deal crops up. Well, today is no exception. 
For the first time since the Black Friday and Cyber Monday sale events last fall, Amazon is slashing a straight $100 off my beloved headphones, knocking the price down to $248 for a limited time.
Sure, many will argue that the XM4 aren't the absolute best wireless headphones on the market, nor are they the newest model from Sony (that honor belongs to the WH-1000XM5). But I love the XM4 because they're so perfectly balanced: not too expensive, great-sounding, with awesome battery life and enough customizable settings to keep even the most particular audiophiles happy. 
Sony WH-1000XM4: $348 $248 at Amazon
Head to Amazon right now and you'll score a straight 29% off the Sony WH-1000XM4, a stylish and versatile pair of wireless headphones that I use every day for meetings, noise cancellation, podcasts, and more. This is the first major discount that the headphones have received since last fall, so it's a good time to buy if you missed all the Black Friday festivities. 
Despite their slightly advanced age, the Sony WH-1000XM4 headphones remain an excellent choice for most listeners, with active noise cancellation (ANC), up to 30 hours of battery life, and loads of customizable EQ settings in the companion app. They also collapse and travel better than the newer Sony XM5, and I can personally attest to their comfort — I typically wear them for my entire work day to listen to music and drown out background noise. 
Of course, the XM4 aren't for everyone. They're a bit too hot if you're looking for workout headphones, and $250 might still be a bit steep if you just want a simple pair of headphones (some models by Beats will go for considerably less, for instance). 
It's also worth noting that the upcoming spring sales may drop the newer XM5 to just slightly above this price, so if you want the latest and greatest from Sony, it might be worth the wait. But with that said, if you're looking for a premium headphones experience that costs less today, then this deal presents an excellent opportunity.

                Employers continued hiring in January, but at a slower pace than the previous month. Job gains were concentrated in retail, health care and government.

Employers added fewer jobs in January than in the previous two months as cold weather gripped much of the country.
A report from the Labor Department on Friday showed employers added 143,000 jobs last month, a significant downshift from December, when revised figures show employers added more than twice that number.

Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dipped to 4% in January, from 4.1% the month before. 
Job gains last month were concentrated in retail, health care and government. Construction and manufacturing showed little job growth in January, while bars and restaurants cut about 16,000 jobs. 
The Labor Department says neither the Los Angeles wildfires nor severe winter weather elsewhere appeared to have much effect on the job market. 
Over the last three months, employers have added an average of 237,000 jobs per month. That solid growth, combined with the low unemployment rate, suggests the Federal Reserve will feel little pressure to lower interest rates any time soon.
Loading...
Average wages in January were up 4.1% from a year ago, which is likely more than enough to outpace inflation. Wages have been climbing faster than prices now for the better part of two years. 
Friday's report also included a routine, annual revision to previous job figures, based on more complete data from state tax records. The revision shows that employers added about 2.3 million jobs in the 12 months ending in March of last year. That's 589,000 fewer than initially reported.  
The Labor Department also revised its population estimate sharply upward, to account for higher immigration in the last two years. The change boosted the estimated size of the workforce by 2.1 million. A large influx of foreign-born workers has enabled employers to continue adding jobs at a robust pace. 
However, economists say that could change, given the strict new limits on immigration imposed by the Trump administration.

As healthcare startups hope for an opening in the IPO market this year, investors' standards for their public prospects are higher than ever.

        It's been a dismal few years for healthcare IPOs. The last wave of startups went public in 2021, with 23 healthcare companies going out that year via IPO or SPAC, according to Rock Health. In the next three years, only four companies went public — and only two of those, Waystar and Tempus AI, remain on the market today.
    

        With interest rates expected to drop this year, founders are waiting with bated breath for another wave of healthcare IPOs. But investors say those startups will have to work a lot harder to go public this time around.
    

        Most of the healthcare companies that went public in the last cycle haven't put in a strong showing. Companies like care management player Neue Health, formerly Bright Health Group, and healthcare navigator Accolade have since gone private in acquisitions, valuing them at a fraction of their IPO prices. Others, including diagnostic testing company Cue Health and senior care provider Cano Health, have declared bankruptcy.
    

        Many of the companies that have remained public have seen their shares plummet, like telehealth company Amwell, which went public in 2020 at a $3.9 billion valuation. Today, its market cap is about $165 million.
    

        The public healthcare markets are in dire need of a redemption arc. Investors and bankers told Business Insider that healthcare startups considering an IPO should have revenue in the several hundreds of millions, profitability, and growth at a pace of 30% or more on top of the prior year's revenue. Those expectations represent a striking heel-turn from the last cycle when high-growth but unprofitable healthtech companies with lower revenue could consider public market debuts.
    

        Those elevated standards hope to ensure a stronger performance for the next wave of public healthcare companies, a critical step in proving the industry's viability for future investors.
    

        ""A lot of the hype companies go public, and then a few years later their prices drop, which trickles down to the earlier-stage investors who think, 'Why are we putting hundreds of millions of dollars into these companies that IPO for a few billion, and then six months later they are at less than $1 billion in value?'"" said Farzad Soleimani, a partner at early-stage firm 1984 Ventures. ""I think we are at a stage where we need to see a lot of improvements in that regard.""
    

        Several investors and founders mentioned the ""rule of 40"" as a benchmark for what healthcare companies should go public. Typically applied to software companies, that principle states that the sum of a company's revenue growth rate and profit margin should be equal to or greater than 40%.
    

        Reaching those metrics isn't so easy for healthcare startups, which can struggle to reach tech-expected margins when facing the high costs of employing clinicians or navigating insurance reimbursement.
    

        ""Especially in healthcare, the bar is pretty high — those scaled, $500-million-plus revenue companies, ideally profitable, and then you want to be growing at a reasonable clip too,"" said Yuri Lee, a partner at IVP. ""A lot of the companies that would've gone public a few years ago, I don't think they're in a place be able to meet those three criteria.""
    

        Multiple investors and bankers told Business Insider that physical therapy startup Hinge Health is the best choice for the year's first digital health IPO, with margins more closely resembling a software company than a healthcare services provider. Hinge Health hired banks including Morgan Stanley last year to prepare for its intended public market debut, with the hopes of going public in early 2025, BI reported in September.
    

Omada Health filed its own S-1 last summer ahead of a potential IPO, BI reported in October. The startup, which has been treating diabetes since 2011, saw significant growth in 2024 tied to its weight loss offering as GLP-1 drug use surged, CEO Sean Duffy told BI that month.
    

        Some IPO prospects are staying private for now to buy up other companies to boost their growth. Private equity-backed Datavant told BI in January that the $7 billion health data company is looking for multiple acquisitions this year. With ""well over"" $1 billion in revenue and steady profitability, CEO Kyle Armbrester said Datavant plans to buy new assets using the cash on its balance sheet.
    

        Other startups have been vocal about their plans to reach profitability before considering an IPO.
    

Sword Health CEO Virgilio Bento told BI in 2023 that he'd only be interested in taking the physical therapy startup public if it's profitable, a milestone he later told Axios the company expected to hit in 2024. He said Sword could go public as soon as the second half of 2025.
    

        Fellow diabetes startup Virta Health told BI in January that it expects to reach profitability by the end of 2025. CEO Sami Inkinen said an IPO is the natural next step for the company, but one he doesn't want to take if Virta is burning more cash than it's bringing in.
    

        That's a mistake that plagued digital health companies in the last cycle of IPOs, he said, adding that there are still startups considering IPOs in the next cycle that haven't reached profitability.
    

        ""Nearly all of these companies are hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and still zero profits. That is very dangerous,"" he said.
    

        With companies like Amwell and 23andMe sitting at market caps in the few hundreds of millions, healthcare investors are eager for a stronger set of public comps with higher valuations they can use as reference points when valuing private companies.
    

        However, some of the startups hoping to go public haven't announced funding since 2020 or 2021, when VCs regularly used sky-high revenue multiples to calculate valuations. Hinge Health, for example, will have to contend with the $6.2 billion valuation it landed in 2021 if it doesn't raise another round of funding before going public. It's unclear whether the current healthcare IPO hopefuls will be able to match those high valuations in their public market debuts.
    

        Some recent take-private deals, like Transcarent's acquisition of Accolade in January — a $621 million deal, about half of Accolade's valuation at the time of its 2020 IPO — could help ease the problem. Removing the healthcare navigator from the public markets could allow other navigators, like Included Health, to go public with better multiples.
    

        Included had previously filed its S-1 for a 2022 IPO, but called off its plans when the market tanked, CEO Owen Tripp told BI in January. This time around, he said, fewer point solutions are standing up to public investor scrutiny.
    

        ""The solutions I see coming now are way more complete and just bigger,"" he said. ""We could have gone public based on our numbers then — think about where we are now.""
    

        More than half of the digital health companies that went public in 2021 did so through mergers with special purpose acquisition companies, an appealing option for startups hoping for a quicker, less regulated route to the public markets. But the poor performance of those deals has put SPACs mostly off-limits for healthcare startups hoping to go public in the next wave, said Jon Swope, a managing director in Barclays' healthtech investment banking practice.
    

        ""It's unlikely that we see companies using that vehicle that could go public the regular way,"" he told BI in October.
    

        Scott Barclay, a managing director at Insight Partners, said the high standards for new healthcare IPOs are a sign of a healthier market. Because the market shifted from valuing growth alone to growth alongside profit, he said, founders have been forced to bring stronger and more efficient businesses to the table.
    

        ""We're seeing more intrinsically good business models powered by software versus a lot of previous shots in the last generation,"" he said. ""The market drop has forged founders with businesses that are just stronger.""

8,2025-02-07,"Less than a year has passed since the release of the current iPad Air. However, a new one could launch very soon. As Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman notes, the inventory for the popular tablet is dwindling, suggesting that a new model is set to launch.
The 2024 iPad Air was launched in May 2024, introducing a new 13-inch model alongside the traditional 11-inch model. Both versions feature Liquid Retina displays that offer vibrant colors and sharp details and are powered by the M2 chip, which provides improved performance compared to the previous generation. Beyond this, there were a few changes made between this and the previous model, which arrived in 2022.
As we noted in January, the 2025 iPad Air is likely to have a M4 chip installed. This is the same chipset found on the iPad Pro (2024) and entry-level MacBook Pro.
At the time, Gurman characterized the upcoming iPad Air models as having more “specification upgrades than design changes.”
News of a new iPad Air comes as Canalys has announced that worldwide tablet shipments rose by 9.2% in 2024.  Apple continues to lead the market, showcasing a 5.3% year-over-year growth in iPad sales. This growth is not surprising, as Apple introduced a new iPad Air last year along with new iPad Pro and iPad mini models. It’s worth noting that in 2023, the company did not release a new tablet.
The current iPad Air starts at $599.
In addition to a new iPad Air, Apple will likely reveal a new iPhone SE in the coming weeks. The entry-level phone was last updated in 2022.
If you have patiently waited for Apple to release an iPad Air with an OLED, we have bad news. LG Display is adjusting its OLED production away from the iPad Pro because of weak demand. According to The Elec (via MacRumors), production is shifting to manufacturing iPhone displays, which could delay the launch of the world's first iPad Air with OLED.
According to the report, LG Display hopes to maintain its current production of iPad OLED inventory until the end of February. By then, it hopes Apple will give it the go-ahead to shift production to OLED iPhone panels.
The iPhone has a powerful camera built-in, but what if you could turn it into a proper digital camera that can keep you snapping Ansel Adams-worthy pictures all day long? Belkin's newest accessory promises to do just that, and we really hope it works. The Stage Power Grip is a more ergonomically designed accessory that helps you take great shots while reducing shake, and it's just been announced at CES 2025.
Belkin hopes to release the Stage Power Grip sometime in May, but that date isn't set in stone (nor is the price). It functions as both a button to take pictures and a grip to help you keep a steady hand. It attaches to your iPhone via MagSafe and includes a 10,000mAh power bank, too. There's also a built-in USB-C cable for charging other devices (as well as your iPhone, if needed).
Apple did not release any new iPads in 2023. However, this year marked a significant change with the introduction of all-new versions of the iPad mini, iPad Air, and iPad Pro. Notably absent from this list is the standard iPad, which hasn't been updated in nearly three years. This is expected to change in the coming months. According to MacRumors, Apple plans to release an updated iPad alongside the iPhone SE 4 in spring 2025.
While limited information about the upcoming iPad is available, several details have emerged in recent months. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the new tablet is expected to support Apple Intelligence, just like all iPads released in 2024 do. This support suggests that the 11th-generation iPad will likely have a newer A-series chip and at least 8GB of RAM.

Pizza Hut in China is winning big by selling cheap pizzas.

        The chain is leveraging weakened consumer confidence and expanding its lower-priced offerings to attract cost-conscious Chinese consumers.
    

        Parent company Yum China, which also owns the country's KFC operations, reported that Pizza Hut saw a 3% year-on-year sales growth in its latest quarter.
    

        The earnings report also said that Pizza Hut saw its operating profit increase by 156% in the quarter compared to the year before.
    

        Yum China's chiefs said in the Thursday earnings call that the company has taken several steps to lower customers' prices.
    

        ""We're transforming Pizza Hut into a more mass-market brand by widening price range and enriching the menu,"" Yum China's finance chief, Adrian Ding, said in the call.
    

        Ding said that sales of its cheap pizzas, priced under RMB50 — slightly less than $7 — increased 50% in 2024 compared to the year before.
    

        Pizza Hut had also lowered the price of ""about 30 iconic products,"" starting from ""RMB9.9 for the drinks and dessert,"" Yum China's CEO, Joey Wat, said to investors. RMB9.9 is roughly equal to $1.40.
    

        The chain also expanded its budget wing — Pizza Hut Wow. The Wow stores offer smaller, cheaper versions of Pizza Hut's regular fare. Wat said that despite the lower average ticket spend at these stores, they attract younger customers and expand Pizza Hut's market.
    

        Pizza Hut opened 412 new stores in 2024, bringing the total to 3,724. Wow stores, which were introduced in May 2024 and mostly converted from older Pizza Hut stores, exceeded 200 by the end of 2024.
    

        ""Pizza Hut has made significant progress in transforming itself to become more affordable for customers and more profitable for the company,"" Ding said to investors in the call.
    

        The chain has been successful in China, seeing positive transaction growth for eight consecutive quarters. Its success is partly attributed to the introduction of products that appeal to local tastes, such as its wildly popular durian pizza in 2024.
    

        Yum China reported a total annual revenue of $11.3 billion in 2024, a 3% increase from the year before. Its stock price rose about 9% in after-hours trading on early Friday.
    

        When contacted for comment, representatives for Yum China directed BI to the statements Wat and Ding made in the earnings call.
    

        Representatives of Yum China did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

12,2025-02-07,"Apple's inventory of iPad Air and MacBook Air models is running low at its retail stores, indicating that refreshes for the devices are likely just around the corner.
Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports that Apple's stock of both products is ""dwindling,"" as the company gears up to launch new updates. Apple is expected to launch a MacBook Air with its faster M4 chip, along with updated iPad Air models during the first half of 2025. 
Some rumors have suggested the iPad Air will have the M3 chip that's a step behind the M4 in the iPad Pro, but Gurman said in January that Apple could opt for the M4 instead. A leaker who has provided reliable information in the past also said in January that the iPad Air 7 will use the M3 chip, not the M4 chip. No other major hardware or design changes are expected.
Apple is also developing a new version of the Magic Keyboard for the iPad Air. It will not have an aluminum top case like the iPad Pro, but it could have a function row of keys and some other features from the iPad Pro Magic Keyboard. 
Apple is also believed to be working on a new 11th-generation entry-level iPad. Gurman has said Apple will use the A17 Pro chip – the same one that's in the iPhone 15 Pro models and the iPad mini 7. The A17 Pro chip supports Apple Intelligence, so presumably that means the new iPad will come with at least 8GB of RAM, which is the minimum requirement for Apple's suite of AI features.
Gurman's inventory stock check was mentioned in a report claiming that Apple could announce the new iPhone SE 4 as soon as next week via a press release, with a launch to follow later in February. Gurman suggests that Apple will unveil its new low-cost iPhone the same time as the new PowerBeats Pro 2 earbuds, which Apple plans to unveil as soon as February 11. However, he also said the new MacBook Air and iPads are ""coming soon,"" suggesting they are likely to arrive later in the spring.

The US had disappointing job growth in January but a welcome drop in unemployment.

        The economy added 143,000jobs, below the forecast of 169,000. However, unemployment was expected to be 4.1% again but declined to 4%.
    

        ""Job gains occurred in health care, retail trade, and social assistance,"" a Bureau of Labor Statistics news release said on Friday. ""Employment declined in the mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction industry.""
    

        Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, described the labor market as tight and job growth as uneven.
    

        She pointed out that goods-producing industries added no net jobs overall. Employment dropped by 7,000 in mining and logging but increased by 3,000 in manufacturing and 4,000 in construction.
    

        ""It is really struggling under the weight of high interest rates,"" Pollak said. ""That pesky 10-year yield is killing investment in production.""
    

        December's job growth was revised from 256,000 to 307,000. November's gain was also revised, from 212,000 to 261,000.
    

        It is typical for the monthly jobs report to include revisions for the previous two months of data.
    

        The new jobs report brings in the BLS' annual revisions to previous job creation figures based on updated data from businesses. That includes revisions for 2024 and other recent years.
    

        A majority of months in 2024 saw smaller job gains than previously reported.
    

        The labor force participation rate ticked up from 62.5% to 62.6%. The employment-population ratio also ticked up from 60% to 60.1%.
    

        Year-over-year wage growth was steady. Average earnings increased from $34.47 an hour in January 2024 to $35.87 an hour this past January. That's a 4.1% increase, same as December's increase.
    

        Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told Business Insider that job seeking can be tough depending on someone's industry.
    

        ""The labor market is solid, but for workers who are in a field like tech or marketing or some of these other areas where hiring has been lower, it maybe isn't going to feel like that,"" Stahle said.
    

        He added that's not the same case for healthcare workers and people landing state and local government jobs. Healthcare in particular has had robust monthly job growth compared to other major areas of the job market.
    

        Noah Yosif, chief economist at the American Staffing Association, said earlier this week that ""labor market momentum in 2025 will depend on two key trends — lower labor costs for employers and higher confidence among employees.""
    

        Yosif added that ""labor costs remain much too high for employers, and this week's quits numbers show that employees are still not confident in their prospects of finding a new position."" Quits have been fairly steady and low compared to the Great Resignation, data up to December showed.
    

        The next Federal Open Market Committee meeting, at which members will decide what to do with interest rates, is scheduled for mid-March. After the new jobs report, CME FedWatch showed a 91.5% chance of a hold in March, slightly up from the 85.5% chance earlier Friday morning. More economic data will be published before the meeting.
    

        ""With our policy stance significantly less restrictive than it had been, and the economy remaining strong, we do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,"" Fed chair Jerome Powell said after the January FOMC meeting.
    

        Markets were largely unaffected after the report. Stock futures barely moved, and bond yields ticked slightly up, suggesting that investors don't see the report as having too much of an impact on the Fed's plans for the rest of the year.

15,2025-02-07,"Slime isnât just for kidsâ TV shows anymoreâit could be the next breakthrough straight out of sci-fi.
Researchers at the University of Guelph in Canada have developed “slime” that produces electricity when compressed, and its potential applications range from clean energy production to medical products. Think elementary school slime project, but on steroids. Their work was detailed in a February 1 study published in the Journal of Molecular Liquids.
The prototype material is made of oleic acid (a fatty acid present in olive oil), amino acids (which make up our protein) and 90% water, meaning itâs absolutely natural and not harmful to the body. Why is this important?
“Our bodies produce small electric fields to attract healing cells to an open wound,” Erica Pensini, an environmental engineer at the University of Guelph and co-author on the study, said in a Canadian Light Source research institute statement. “By creating a bandage that increases this electric field, healing could theoretically happen faster. In this case, the bandage would be activated by our natural movements and breathing.”
Thatâs why she “wanted to make something that is 100 per cent benign and that I would put on my skin without any concerns,” she explained. The team’sÂ slime-like material could also theoretically be used in synthetic skin to help train future robots to check a patientâs pulse, she explained, or in shoe insoles to better analyze peopleâs manner of walking.
While the material can produce energy, the researchers also discovered that they can change its crystalline structure by applying an electric field. Using a synchrotronâ”like a super-microscope,” according to Pensiniâthe researchers observed the slime forming microscopic structures, including layered, sponge-like, and hexagonal patterns. Watching this happen must’ve been fun, but the discovery could also have major implications for targeted drug delivery.
This was undoubtedly a fun thing to observe, but this could also have important applications involving the targeted delivery of medicine.
“Imagine you have the material take an initial structure that contains a pharmaceutical substance and then, when an electric field is applied to it, the structure changes to release the medicine,” she said.
The seemingly magic slime could be used in contexts beyond the medical world. Because it can generate electricity, it could be put into floors to generate electricity from the pressure of people walking on it (Coldplayâs Music of the Spheres World Tour kinetic dancefloors, anyone?).
While more research is needed before this “slime” can enter the market, Pensini is already testing it on herself by using it as a balm for her hands after rock climbing: “I need an initial guinea pig, so it might as well be me, right?”
Just thinkâone day, you might be reaching for slime instead of bandages at your local pharmacy.

Martin Olive, the San Francisco man shot seven times in the South of Market, is choosing to remember those who came to his aid rather than the man who fired the shots.
SAN FRANCISCO - A San Francisco man who was shot seven times outside his South of Market cannabis shop recalled the horrific attack.
What we know:
Martin Olive said he remembered the gunman pulling out a weapon and firing at him. However, he is choosing to focus on those who have rallied to his side following the shooting.
The shooting outside Olive's cannabis dispensary was a shock even in the sometimes troubled South of Market neighborhood.
Olive, founder of the Vapor Room, said he was outside leaning against a bike rack when a man he didn't remember having previous interactions with got off an e-bike, pulled a gun and pointed it at him.
What they're saying:
""Then I realized the severity of what was happening, and I put my hands up and I, sort of tried to dodge what was impending,"" said Olive. ""Very clearly aimed at my head. Two shots that hit me in the cheek. One went up and hit my earlobe, the top of my ear. The other open split my cheek  down here and split my earlobe and then that was the moment that reality became a whole different thing and my life changed forever.""
Olive said he remembers the gun going off repeatedly; two shots grazing his cheek and hitting his ear, two more in his back. In all, he suffered seven gunshot wounds.

    Featured
  
San Francisco police officials on Tuesday released body-camera videos showing the deadly police shooting of a suspect who hours earlier had shot and wounded a cannabis dispensary founder.
Olive credits first responders and excellent medical care with saving his life, including bystanders like the woman who used her shirt to apply pressure to his wounds.
""Literally the shirt off her back and she happened to be a nurse,"" said Olive. ""She was like an angel. The first angel that I encountered through this entire process, and there have been many.""
What we know:
Police said the gunman, 34-year-old Cheasarak Chong, made his way to his apartment above the Vapor Room after shooting Olive. After a standoff with officers in which he fired at police, Chong was shot dead.
Olive said he'd heard Chong obtained the guns legally.
Olive said he doesn't recall ever seeing or interacting with Chong, who had previously been acquitted of attempted murder in 2018.
Olive said before he learned that Chong was dead, he worried he might have to face him again someday.
""He didn't hesitate one second to end my life, to attempt to end my life,"" said Olive. ""I feel safer that I don't have to worry about him now or in the future.""
Olive is facing a long recovery with gunshot injuries to his cheek and ear, a broken jaw, some facial paralysis, a broken scapula, and numerous cracked ribs. He said he's also coping with nightmares and PTSD following the unprovoked attack.
Olive said he's focusing on his recovery and is thankful to those around him who have rallied to his side.
""I'm sort of open to the universe offering me some more blessings and shining some light on other paths I can take or where my next path is. I'm open to what can happen,"" he said.
For now, Olive is shuttering the Vapor Room to focus on his recovery.
Friends have set up a GoFundMe page to help cover his living expenses and mounting medical bills.
The community around him, which includes his friends and employees, wished him well and a speedy recovery.
The Source: Information for this story comes from an interview with the victim, Martin Olive, along with previous reporting.

Take-Two just set a new all-time record.
By 
    Eddie Makuch
   on February 7, 2025 at 12:09PM PST
Grand Theft Auto parent company Take-Two's stock price is soaring this week following the company's recent earnings report on February 6. Why is the share value surging? It's often hard to know what makes a stock price move in the market, but there are some strong signals for what might be causing it this time.
Starting with the numbers, Take-Two's stock price is currently trading above $210 per share, which is about $35 higher than where it was when markets closed on Thursday. That's a gigantic gain for a single day, and it helped propel Take-Two's stock price to the highest value in the company's history.
Take-Two's previous high of around $210 per share came in 2021 during the pandemic, when many entertainment companies saw huge gains due to stay-at-home orders. For a historical comparison, when GTA V was released in September 2013, Take-Two stock was trading at around $17 per share. Anyone who bought back then, or earlier, and still holds Take-Two shares today is doing quite well.
On Thursday, Take-Two made a couple major announcements. First, management confirmed that Grand Theft Auto VI remains on track for release in Fall 2025, though management said it cannot rule out a delay later on. Perhaps the more notable piece of news that may have contributed to the stock-price growth was that Take-Two significantly beat Wall Street's earnings expectations, which investors are seemingly responding positively to.
Take-Two lost 71 cents per share during the latest quarter for a total net loss of $125.2 million for the period. But analysts expected Take-Two to lose about 90 cents per share, meaning Take-Two's performance, while in the red overall for the period, was far better than what many expected. This, coupled with the announcement that GTA 6 remains on track, may help explain why Take-Two stock is exploding. As always, though, there are never any clear answers for why a stock moves in a particular direction.
Every Rockstar Games release in the past decade has been delayed beyond its originally announced date, so some continue to believe GTA 6 might get pushed to 2026. Some are theorizing that GTA 6 was actually already delayed but only internally given reports of missed deadlines. Only time will tell if GTA 6 makes it out on time, so keep checking back with GameSpot for more.
Reacting to the long wait for GTA 6, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said, ""We know that Rockstar seeks perfection. I never claim success before it occurs."" He added: ""I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success, so we're all running scared and looking over our shoulders and we know that the competition is not asleep. Our whole organization is super excited.""
GTA VI has extremely big shoes to fill, as GTA V has sold more than 210 million units, propelling the entire series to 440 million copies sold. One company believes GTA VI can sell 40 million units and drive $3 billion in revenue during its first year alone.
Whenever it's ready, GTA VI will be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Take-Two is likely to bring some of its games to Switch 2, but no one should expect GTA 6 to be among them.

An AI-generated image of a speaker attached to an iPhone
Sonos allegedly toyed around with making a speaker that would use MagSafe to attach to the back of an iPhone, but couldn't seem to nail down a target audience. If you're in the business of making products, chances are you'll come up with ideas that sound good at the time, but reveal themselves to be impractical, if not outright impossible, at some point in the design process. Apple knows this, as the company was rumored to scrap the Apple Car after the project lacked direction. And, even if it wasn't, Apple likely realized that it would never be able to sell vehicles at its expected margins.But it's not always large, complex projects that don't make it to the assembly line. According to The Verge, Sonos recently scrapped an idea for a MagSafe-compatible Bluetooth speaker. The speaker would have been a small, rectangular speaker that, when connected to an iPhone via MagSafe, would have automatically played audio. It would have featured a similar design to Apple's now discontinued MagSafe Battery Pack.The idea was likely born out of Sonos' acquisition of Mayht Holding in the first half of 2022. Mayht Holding, in Sonos' words, had ""invented a new, revolutionary approach to audio transducers,"" which would allow for smaller and lighter speakers. However, the project went the way of many projects that sound like a good idea at the time. Specifically, Sonos couldn't suss out the target market, beyond ""Gen Z.""Which, if you stop to think about it, makes quite a bit of sense. The speaker would not be most people's first choice when it comes to playing audio. While it might have sounded better than the iPhone's tiny, built-in speakers, there's not a clear idea of where the product would be used. For watching video content at home, most people will opt for a larger screen, be that a laptop, a smart TV, or a desktop with a larger monitor. For watching content or listening to music on the go, you run into the rudeness factor. Nobody likes the person sitting at the DMV, listening to something through their phone speakers, let alone someone who brought a Bluetooth speaker to do it.  You're not going to get dirty looks for using AirPods Pro in publicAnd even listening to music is a stretch. At home, someone would probably prefer a larger speaker, allowing them to move freely around the room. On the go, they'd opt for headphones. This leaves a very small target audience. Perhaps teens and tweens who want a speaker for their bedroom, or someone who lives in a single dorm room or a studio apartment. It could also have some utility for those who like to camp or hike, as the speaker would be compact enough to bring along in a backpack. Of course, many outdoor enthusiasts would dissuade people of this notion, as it does count as noise pollution.Beyond that, it doesn't seem like many people would have a need for a tiny speaker that snapped to the back of their phone. However, it seems that Sonos realized that because they wound up nixing the idea at some point.Sonos has gone through significant downsizing in recent years. In 2023, Sonos laid off 7% of its workers and pulled back its real estate presence. More recently —  this past Wednesday, in fact —  the company announced that it would lay off an additional 12%, or roughly 200 people. CEO Tom Conrad said that the company had grown to a point where collaboration was difficult and would be better off ""reorganizing into flatter, smaller, and more focused teams."" He notes that being smaller and more focused should help the company prioritize its work, as recent projects suffered from a lack of commitment. If you're bummed that Sonos' MagSafe speaker never made it to market, there are some alternatives. Scosche has the BoomCan MS, a $30 speaker that magnetically attaches to iPhone. Amazon also features dozens of speakers that purport to do the same thing. Their often alarmingly low price point probably gives you an idea of the sound quality you're going to get. 
If you're in the business of making products, chances are you'll come up with ideas that sound good at the time, but reveal themselves to be impractical, if not outright impossible, at some point in the design process. 
Apple knows this, as the company was rumored to scrap the Apple Car after the project lacked direction. And, even if it wasn't, Apple likely realized that it would never be able to sell vehicles at its expected margins.
But it's not always large, complex projects that don't make it to the assembly line. According to The Verge, Sonos recently scrapped an idea for a MagSafe-compatible Bluetooth speaker. 
The speaker would have been a small, rectangular speaker that, when connected to an iPhone via MagSafe, would have automatically played audio. It would have featured a similar design to Apple's now discontinued MagSafe Battery Pack.

The idea was likely born out of Sonos' acquisition of Mayht Holding in the first half of 2022. Mayht Holding, in Sonos' words, had ""invented a new, revolutionary approach to audio transducers,"" which would allow for smaller and lighter speakers. 
However, the project went the way of many projects that sound like a good idea at the time. Specifically, Sonos couldn't suss out the target market, beyond ""Gen Z.""
Which, if you stop to think about it, makes quite a bit of sense. The speaker would not be most people's first choice when it comes to playing audio. 
While it might have sounded better than the iPhone's tiny, built-in speakers, there's not a clear idea of where the product would be used. For watching video content at home, most people will opt for a larger screen, be that a laptop, a smart TV, or a desktop with a larger monitor. 
For watching content or listening to music on the go, you run into the rudeness factor. Nobody likes the person sitting at the DMV, listening to something through their phone speakers, let alone someone who brought a Bluetooth speaker to do it. 
And even listening to music is a stretch. At home, someone would probably prefer a larger speaker, allowing them to move freely around the room. On the go, they'd opt for headphones. 
This leaves a very small target audience. Perhaps teens and tweens who want a speaker for their bedroom, or someone who lives in a single dorm room or a studio apartment. 
It could also have some utility for those who like to camp or hike, as the speaker would be compact enough to bring along in a backpack. Of course, many outdoor enthusiasts would dissuade people of this notion, as it does count as noise pollution.
Beyond that, it doesn't seem like many people would have a need for a tiny speaker that snapped to the back of their phone. However, it seems that Sonos realized that because they wound up nixing the idea at some point.
Sonos has gone through significant downsizing in recent years. In 2023, Sonos laid off 7% of its workers and pulled back its real estate presence. More recently —  this past Wednesday, in fact —  the company announced that it would lay off an additional 12%, or roughly 200 people.

It's potentially a good idea, depending upon the sound quality. I would use it for travel, in hotel rooms, for example. But, I already have a Sonos Roam for that purpose, so I wouldn't be in the market for a speaker like this unless the sound quality were at least as good as the Roam. Also, as Apple4thewin noted, it needs a kickstand or else the speaker is going to be pointed at the ceiling.

I, for one, am not sad it was scrapped. The days of boom boxes on shoulders blasting everyone’s ears are long gone and should stay that way. It’s bad enough people speak loudly on speakerphone. Don’t want to hear their playlist too.

Scosche makes pretty okay stuff, it's about what you'd expect. I anticipate that Sonos' scrapped product would have also functioned as a kickstand. I think they probably had intentions of marketing it toward people who obsessively scroll short-form video (think TikTok, YouTube Shorts, and Instagram/Facebook Reels) but then realized that people tend to do this when they're killing time in public, not solely when they're sitting at home.I'm sure there's people who would have snagged it. Or something like it. Sonos doesn't make cheap products, and I feel like the target audience of 15-21 year olds (Again, I am just assuming this) would probably be reticent (or fully unable) to drop $75-$110 on a magnetic bluetooth speaker, and the 22 and up crowd would probably go for one of their other products for home use.

See, that's my thing, right? Sonos makes solid products and a snap-on speaker feels a bit gimmicky. I suspect that the sound quality would have been nowhere near the quality of the Roam. And I guarantee you that the speaker would have functioned as a kickstand by way of thickness (most other snap-on speakers do this alreadyh) or had a pop-out kickstand option.I dunno. Maybe it's cause I'm an old lady, or maybe it's because I don't want to store niche use items, but it certainly wouldn't be for me. Feels kinda like a stocking stuffer idea for the 15-19 range. I can tell you that it would have probably been pretty nice when I lived in a loft apartment and my bedroom lacked any good sound options. Barring that, though...

It’s just a week until Valentine’s Day, a multi-billion dollar spending jamboree. 
As often happens, the people we depend on for much of it get the short end of the deal, but a little mindful planning can make a difference.
The heart shape we associate with love came from leaves. The ivy and fig leaves in ancient paintings, and perhaps the silphium leaf of the giant fennel plant, associated with aphrodisiacs.
180 years ago, Richard Cadbury combined two innovations–he added sugar to bitter drinking chocolate, and he put the chocolates in a red, heart-shaped box. 
About a hundred years ago, Joyce Hall brought valentine’s cards to the USA.
The race was on. Best not to show up empty-handed.
If you care, avoid cheap chocolate. Cheap chocolate comes from cacao grown by some of the poorest people on Earth, many of them children, under conditions that are the direct result of oligopoly commodity power.
Acumen has invested in several chocolate companies that are committed to systemic change in the chocolate business that also happen to make extraordinary chocolate.
And my friends at Askinosie have sold almost all of our limited edition collectible chocolate bar. 
When we give a gift, we like to think that it’s the thought that counts. But our actions are votes, signals to the market, and a message to manufacturers.
Cheap chocolate might be convenient, but we can care enough to change the system.
Don’t buy cheap chocolate for someone you care about.

21,2025-02-07,"The Energy Secretary Ed Miliband is standing by the government's pledge to bring down household energy bills by ""up to £300 by 2030"".
Energy bills went up in January and are expected to rise again in April and Miliband has faced repeated questions about whether that pre-election promise is deliverable.
He has blamed fossil fuel prices for the rises and says the answer is clean, home-grown power: ""the cheapest forms of power are… solar, offshore wind and onshore wind"".
The government wants to remove nearly all fossil fuels from UK electricity production by 2030.
More power is coming from renewable sources than ever before, so why isn't this translating into cheaper household bills?
There are a number of reasons, including the time and money it takes to make the power system greener, the question of who pays and the way the electricity market is set up.
The UK's electricity is expensive.
Compared with countries in the European Union, UK domestic electricity prices ranked fourth highest in the first half of 2024 - the most recent government data.
This is for consumers with medium usage, including taxes and subsidies.
For industrial electricity, the UK had the highest prices - for medium users - over the same period. 
The UK has much higher electricity prices - both domestic and industrial - than other large economies outside Europe, such as the US and Canada.
The largest, and most variable, component of a UK customer's electricity bill is the ""wholesale"" price. This is the cost at which suppliers buy it from the companies that generate it.
Other parts of the bill include ""network"" costs for operating, maintaining and upgrading the power grid, and ""policy"" costs, which include government levies to help fund environmental projects.
The main reason for the spikes in electricity bills over the past few years has been changes to wholesale costs. This is linked to an increase in international gas prices.
The price for wholesale electricity is set by a bidding process, with each generating company saying what it would be willing to accept to produce a unit of electricity.
Once built, the cost of generating power from renewables is very low, so these typically come in with the cheapest bid. Nuclear might come next.
Gas generators often have the highest costs, because they have to buy gas to burn, as well as paying a ""carbon price"" - a charge for emissions.
The wholesale cost is set by the last unit of electricity needed to meet demand from consumers. This means that even if gas only generates 1% of power at a given time, gas will still set the wholesale price.
In Great Britain, this generally happens more often than its European counterparts, where demand can be met more often without relying on gas.
""The main reason why electricity prices are currently high is because the cost of gas - which is what sets the electricity price - is also high,"" said a spokesperson from the Climate Change Committee, the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions.
Renewables can generate electricity cheaply.
But building a wind farm on land - and particularly out at sea - comes with high up-front costs and the planning process is often lengthy.
The government needs to triple wind and solar capacity and to get developers to build this, it needs to provide certainty that they will get a return on their investment.
It does this by agreeing a fixed price - or strike price - that they will be paid for each unit of electricity they generate for 15 years into the future.
If the wholesale price is below this fixed price, the renewable generator gets paid a top up by a government-owned company; if the wholesale price is above the strike price, the generator pays the difference back.
Any costs or savings are then passed onto consumers via bills.
Strike prices were expensive, but have fallen considerably, apart from a small rise from 2022-24 linked to global supply chain pressures.
As more renewables are connected - and operational improvements mean the grid can be safely run on this type of power - there should be more times when gas is not setting the wholesale price.
""There are in practice very few hours at the moment in which gas does not set the price despite being a minority of the overall generation,"" said Adam Berman, director of policy at Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry.
""The more that you are able to have a renewable infrastructure that can deliver electricity at any hour of the day and in any circumstance, the more you are able to move away from gas setting the price.""
The UK has an ageing electricity grid, which needs upgrading, partly to accommodate new renewable power sources. There are times when wind power is actually paid not to generate, because the grid cannot handle all the electricity that it could produce.
This adds to the network costs in a bill.
Intermittent renewable sources also require backup for when it's not windy or sunny. In the short term, this role will be largely filled by gas, but eventually it could be met by storing renewable energy in batteries or by hydrogen power.
Great Britain's island location means it is more expensive than in continental Europe to build interconnectors - cables to connect electricity systems of neighbouring countries - to help meet periods of low output.
Some analysts have also argued that placing extra social and environmental taxes on electricity bills - rather than gas bills or general taxation - makes electricity artificially expensive.
The government is reviewing the structure of the electricity market, alongside its push for clean power through renewables and nuclear. 
In the long term, renewables ""will be bringing down overall energy bills, and specifically electricity bills, for the UK,"" argues Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London.
But savings in the short term are not guaranteed. A faster rollout of renewables could mean upfront costs - for things like upgrading the grid - being passed onto consumers more quickly. 
Some analysts have also expressed concern that a rush to secure enough renewables to meet the 2030 goal could mean less competitive ""strike prices"", locking in higher costs.
""If you think 10-15 years down the line, you are likely to see the cost for technologies like offshore wind decrease further… but potentially the rush to have to do this in the next couple of years means that you have to lock in a lot of these projects now to make sure that it can deliver [for 2030],"" said Pranav Menon, research associate at the Aurora Energy Research think tank.
""That does mean that you are going to push up against stretched supply chains, which could mean that cost to procure that [extra capacity] increases.""
But a rapid roll-out of renewables would also reduce the UK's dependence on gas - the main cause of the price spike of the past few years - and so there could be benefits sooner if gas prices remain high.
The government says its plans will ""bring down bills for households and businesses for good"" and lowering them by ""up to £300 by 2030"" remains an objective.

Aidan Gomez, the CEO of Cohere, felt vindicated in his belief that powerful AI didn't need to be so expensive when DeepSeek released a model that would go on to blow a $1 trillion hole in the US stock market. 

        ""I think it validated Cohere's strategy that we've been pursuing for a while now,"" the 28-year-old computer scientist said in an interview with Business Insider. ""Spending billions of dollars a year isn't necessary to produce top-tier tech that's competitive.""
    

        But while Gomez, an ex Google researcher, considers DeepSeek's R1 ""a really impressive release,"" he's not convinced it should be a serious option for businesses. 
    

        He said organizations are looking for customized AI models rather than something off the shelf — and are cautious about giving AI tools access to sensitive data. 
    

        ""We don't see the enterprises that we sell to relying on R1 to power their systems,"" Gomez said. ""We don't see it as a competitor on our side.""
    

        As the leader of a $5.5 billion company building AI for enterprises, Gomez has a clear business reason to make this case. But, as one of the eight Google Brain researchers who co-authored the 2017 seminal ""Attention is All You Need"" paper that sparked the generative AI boom, his position carries weight.  
    

        Nor is he alone, with some US firms trying to adopt DeepSeek running into a host of troubles, BI previously reported.   
    

        For Gomez, DeepSeek isn't a quick win for businesses — regardless of how impressive its tech might be.  
    

        ""What we're seeing from enterprises is that they don't just want to buy a model,"" he said. ""You're going to have to build something with that model, you're going to have to deploy a lot of technical resources to see value, and it will take time.""
    

        To unlock ""a new tier of value,"" he thinks enterprises must carefully consider how they customize core AI technology with their proprietary data.
    

        In November, amid an industry-wide debate over whether AI performance gains had hit a wall, leaders cited private and synthetic data as key resources that organizations must tap into to maintain a competitive edge. 
    

        It's a point echoed by Gomez. And, as concerns rumble over DeepSeek being ""back-ended by servers in China"" — US lawmakers are seeking to ban the startup's software from government devices — the Cohere CEO said enterprises must put privacy first if models are to touch ""more and more sensitive data.""
    

        ""That's something that will unlock usage in enterprises because right now, they're hesitant to build systems that touch sensitive data,"" he said. ""Our competitors treat it in a way that's less secure.""
    

        DeepSeek has not returned Business Insider's requests for comment about its data privacy policies. 
    

        While Gomez thinks Deepseek's R1 is impressive, he believes the real value will come from transforming a base model into a tool that's proving to be another hot area for the industry this year: agentic AI. 
    

        Software programs that can perform tasks autonomously have been high on the agenda of business leaders this year. Agentic AI was a hot topic at Davos, while Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the Consumer Electronics Show that 2025 will be the year it takes off.


        Toronto-based Cohere, one of a handful of companies competing with AI rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, is focusing on bringing AI agents to enterprises.
    

        Last month, Cohere introduced its early-access program for North, its own agentic AI that's designed to meet specific workloads. 
    

        Gomez sees it as another way for Cohere to gain an edge over companies that just want to deploy a base model like DeepSeek's R1.
    

        Gomez declined to say how much it can cost Cohere to adapt a platform like North to the needs of specific enterprises. He said after an ""upfront investment,"" agents can ""operate quite autonomously"" once they're plugged in and then allow enterprises to ""start reaping the value.""
    

        Despite his concerns about DeepSeek, Gomez views the startup spun out of a Chinese hedge fund as a positive disruptive force for the AI industry. 
    

        ""The fact that they published their training efficiency numbers let people see that it doesn't need to be so capital-intensive to publish fantastic models,"" he said.
    

        AI leaders continue to scrutinize DeepSeek's claims that it produced AI on par with the performance of Silicon Valley's best models at a fraction of the cost. In the meantime, investors are questioning whether large AI infrastructure spending is still justified. 
    

        Addressing the implications of Sam Altman's $500 billion Stargate project, Gomez said that ""spending more and more"" on infrastructure for training AI models, rather than ""inference,"" is a mistake. Inference refers to an AI model making predictions or decisions about new data, while training is the process of building a model's capabilities. 
    

        ""I think DeepSeek's a big proof point of that,"" he said.
    

        The other implication of DeepSeek's emergence out of seemingly nowhere is the validation of an open-source approach. 
    

        While there is debate over whether DeepSeek's AI is truly open-source — it has secured an MIT license and made its model weights open, but hasn't disclosed the data it used to train it — Gomez sees ""great technology"" coming from both open-source and closed-source players.
    

        Still, enterprises will need more than an impressive Chinese model to build powerful AI into their operations. As Gomez put it, ""It's not just enough to download a model.""

24,2025-02-07,"Sonos, known for its range of high-end speakers, considered developing a speaker that would connect to the iPhone via MagSafe, reports The Verge.
Engineers at the company prototyped a tiny, iPhone-compatible speaker that would attach directly to the device, with music that would play over a Bluetooth connection. According to The Verge, the prototype speaker had a square shape, and it was similar to the look of Apple's now-discontinued MagSafe Battery Pack, but thicker.
Some employees thought the speaker product would resonate with Gen Z, and expected it to deliver good sound regardless of the compact size. Sonos ended up scrapping the project, though, due to ""technical limitations, questionable appeal, and a limited target market.""
Sonos has been working to expand its product lineup. Last year, Sonos introduced the Sonos Ace headphones that compete with high-end headphones like the AirPods Max, and later this year, it is rumored to be planning to introduce a set-top box similar to the Apple TV.

26,2025-02-07,"Thirty nine years ago, the CG wizards at Pixar made us all believe a faceless desk lamp could be enormously expressive and incredibly cute. Apple, with its mind set on home robotics, shows us how such an adorable lamp would look like in real life. The tech giant has been working on a lamp that’s a little goofy while it tries to respond to your requests, and it may be the one Apple Intelligence-enabled device I want in my lifeâmore than any AI assistant on my iPhone.
Appleâs Machine Learning Research division posted a relatively short research paper to Arxiv preprint repository last month detailing its âexpressive and functional movement design for non-anthropomorphic robot.â MacRumors spotted the article and uploaded a YouTube video of the expressive lamp in action. Itâs a device thatâs immediately reminiscent of Pixarâs mascot Luxo Jr., and it’s somehow just as cute. Engineers gestured to get the lamp to move forward or look in a particular direction. Rather than simply moving linearly, the lamp acted equal parts confused and curious, with various states of âattention,â âattitude,â and âexpression,â according to the paper. Apple calls this framework ELEGNT, a clumsy acronym for âexpressive and functional movement design for non-anthropomorphic robot.â
 
You know what, Apple may be on the money here. The expressive robot is far more entertaining than one that merely does what you tell it to. In one highlight, the robot arm tried to extend to look at a note that its arm couldn’t reach, before shaking its head in dejection and apologizing with an AI-generated voice. In another part of the video, a user asked the lamp for the weather. The robot looked outside, looked back, then told the forecast (the action was time the AI uses to send to a generative model and process that information). It then asked if it was invited on a hiking trip with its owner, then looked disappointed when it was told no.
The tricky thing is to make it functional while still having the so-called âattitude.â I remember the struggles of playing The Last Guardian on PlayStation 4, where negotiating with a giant beast that was as likely to follow players’ orders as an actual puppy was at times endearing, yet tedious and occasionally rage-inducing. The other aspect to this “ELEGNT” device is whether the expressive movements add to the emotionality of whatâs otherwise staid and boring speech you typically get from AI chatbots. No matter what, the bot is still just playing pretend. The only thing that matters is if it’s convincing enough you can forget its speech and body language are generated based on algorithms.
Thereâs more than a little speculation about how Apple wants to intrude into smart home tech that’s more than just another HomePod. The latest rumors from trusted sources at Bloomberg claim Apple’s engineers are crafting a touchscreen at the end of a robotic arm. The arm is supposed to follow you and respond to you, hands free with the help of AI. Itâs the kind of idea thatâs neat in concept, though cost and practicability inevitably hinder these kinds of Jetsons-style future tech.
These expressive interactions may set any upcoming smart home tech apart from the many other smart screens on the market. Appleâs engineers heavily cite a 2014 paper in the Journal of Human-Robot Interaction by Guy Hoffman and Wendy Ju, both associate professors at Cornell University. Many of those technology tests for that earlier research were done with a âWizard of Ozâ techniqueâessentially thereâs a âman behind the curtainâ controlling the bot. With the wide-ranging improvements in robotics and AI, we should be able to see how this works when nobodyâs controlling these interactions (though nobody apparently told the Tesla team that).
More recent reports note Apple is developing a smart home camera and another smart home display to compete with AI-enabled Google Nest cameras or Amazonâs Echo Show. This new drive for smart home tech will likely push the Apple Intelligence angle even further, though inevitably Apple hopes to entice customers to the warm bosom of its walled garden. Why buy any other brand that may or may not work with Apple, when you could just buy Apple (though at a premium price).

Most of the electronics that we currently find in the market have the usual black, gray, or white colors. That’s well and good for those who love monochromatic and color-minimalist devices in their spaces. But for someone like me that love to have a lot of colors whether in accessories, clothes, and gadgets, there’s just a few options to choose from. Lexon is one brand that is known to play around with colors in their electronics and speakers. Having fun shades on their devices is a requirement and not just a fad. Now they have found the perfect color companion for some of their most famous devices. 
Designer: Lexon x Pantone
















Pantone is of course pretty familiar to anyone who has ever played around with colors as they categorize all kinds of shades of colors for printing and for products. The Lexon x Pantone collaboration brings the two brands together and as a result, we get even more fun and colorful devices that we can add to our probably already colorful collection of stuff at home. Five of the Lexon classic devices will now come in six distilled colors (three of which were Pantone Colors of the Year): Mimosa (2009 Pantone of the Year), Classic Blue (2020 Pantone of the Year), Rose Quartz (2016 Pantone of the Year), Sand Dollar, Pastel Green, and 2035 (a vivid red). Each of the gadgets come with the iconic white band with Pantone branding, with the color code and name indicated there.






Mino+ is a portable mini Bluetooth speaker that can fit in the palm of your hand but still gives you powerful audio. You can actually enjoy listening to music and podcasts for 3 hours straight when fully charged. The Pantone colors make this tiny speaker even cuter. Flip Classic is a reversible touch-sensitive LCD alarm clock that you just flip over to turn it on or off. Any of the colors in the collection will make your nightstand or bedside table more vibrant. Mina M is a mid-sized LED lamp with a white lampshade and water-resistant casing. The color will light up the lamp’s body, adding creativity to your bedside. 



Tykho 3 is their iconic Bluetooth speaker that brings together a round speaker grill, game console-like controls, and a classic antenna to give you a retro feel. Add to it these Pantone colors and you get an even bolder speaker that creates a warm and dynamic sound ambience. Lastly, Orb is a portable lamp that gets its inspiration from the ball and ball game and has a removable magnetic head and just one button to turn it on and off, change LED colors, and adjust brightness. You can carry this colorful lamp with you in and out of the house. You can even get a gift box that contains four items from this Lexon x Pantone collection: Mino+, Flip Classic, Mina M, and Tykho 3. So all you need to do is get the matching or a different colored Orb to complete your collection.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said on Thursday that the Amazon Web Services cloud business could grow faster if not for ""capacity constraints"" across its data centers.

        He said the shortage has been caused by difficulty procuring AI chips, server components like motherboards, and the energy to power data centers.
    

        ""It is true that we could be growing faster, if not for some of the constraints on capacity,"" Jassy said during Thursday's call with analysts.
    

        On Thursday, AWS reported a 19% increase in sales for the fourth quarter at $28.8 billion, which was slightly below street estimates. Amazon's stock dropped roughly 4% in after-hours as the company gave lower-than-anticipated first-quarter guidance.
    

        Jassy's remarks echo recent statements made by cloud rivals Microsoft and Google. Microsoft's CFO Amy Hood said last week that the company is in ""a pretty constrained capacity place"" when it comes to meeting demand, while Google's leadership said on Tuesday that it ended 2024 with ""more (AI) demand than capacity.""
    

        Jassy said on Thursday that he expects the constraints to ""relax"" in the second half of 2025, adding it is ""hard to complain"" when AWS's AI business is on pace to generate ""multi-billion"" dollars in annual sales.
    

        Amazon expects AI demand to continue growing. For 2025, the company forecast roughly $105 billion in capital expenditures, mostly in data centers, after spending a record $26.3 billion during the fourth-quarter.
    

        Jassy said AWS doesn't make that kind of financial commitment unless there are ""significant signals of demand.""
    

        ""When AWS is expanding its capex, particularly what we think is one of these once-in-a-lifetime type of business opportunities like AI represents, I think it's actually quite a good sign, medium to long term for the AWS business,"" Jassy said.

Welcome to Hotline Rewind, the weekly series where we gather up your questions from the week (and pepper in some from the Hotline archives) about a specific culinary topic. When the weather is—gestures broadly at everything—like this, nothing is more soothing and warming than a bowl of soup. The Hotline is here to help guide you on your brothy journey to soup nirvana with our answers to some of our readers biggest questions about your favorite liquid meal.
Increasing your soup temp above your target, then reducing it, ensures you can efficiently achieve a more consistent and even simmer. This way you’re not getting hot spots, and everything will come up to temp at the same time.
Treat your veggies like bones! Roast them deeply in the oven first so that they caramelize and develop flavor. Then, add them to your stock along with one or more umami bombs like miso, parmesan rinds or kombu.
Egg yolks can be tempered then whisked into soup to thicken things up. The most famous application of this method is in avgolemono, the luscious and lemony Greek chicken soup. In fact the greek word avgolemono actually refers to the method of adding lemon and egg to a recipe in order to thicken. Greek Jews developed the technique to add creaminess while keeping the dish Kosher.
We love both, just for different applications. Firstly, avoid bouillon powders, at least for the purposes of making soup. (It’s great on  on popcorn, though!) The powdered stuff typically has excess sodium and very little, if any, real chicken, beef, or what have you. Instead go for bouillon pastes (like Better Than Boullon), which are essentially super reduced versions of boxed stock that add far more complexity and richness. They also dissolve spectacularly into sauces and gravies, too.
But for soups and stews? We are huge fans of boxed stock. We just recommend you use boxes labeled “reduced sodium” or even “no salt added”. This way you can control your desired amount of seasoning.
Hot take: egg noodles are mid. We like more slurp, and for that you need ramen. Whether it's instant or fresh, they cook super quickly and absorb flavor without becoming soggy.
Your broth isn’t escaping! It's either coagulating due to high levels of collagen or fat in your stock (both of which are good and delicious things that a high quality stock should have). Or, the other ingredients have soaked it up. Either way you can revive your soup with a bit of extra water or stock.
Generally three to four days in the fridge or 8 to 10 months in the freezer. If you added noodles or other starches, try your best to remove them first. They won’t hold up super well sitting in broth.

33,2025-02-07,"Sometimes projects spawn related projects that take on a life of their own. That’s OK, especially when the main project is large and complex, In that case, side-quest projects provide a deliverable that can help keep the momentum of the whole project going. The mojo must flow, after all.
That seems to be what’s going on with this beautiful split-flap clock build by [Erich Styger]. It’s part of a much larger effort which will eventually see 64 separate split-flap units chained together. This project has been going on for a while; we first featured it back in 2022 when it was more of a prototype. Each unit is scratch-built, using laser-cut fiberboard for parts like the spool and frame, thin PVC stock for the flip cards, and CNC-cut vinyl for the letters and numbers. Each unit is powered by its own stepper motor.
To turn four of these displays into a clock, [Erich] milled up a very nice enclosure from beech. From the outside it’s very clean and simple, almost like something from Ikea, but the inside face of the enclosure is quite complex. [Erich] had to mill a lot of nooks and crannies into the wood to provide mounting space and clearance for the split-flap mechanism, plus a thinned-down area at the top of each window to serve as a stop for the flaps. The four displays are controlled by a single controller board, which houses an NXP K22FN512 microcontroller along with four stepper drivers and interfaces for the Hall-effect sensors needed to home each display. There’s also an RS-485 interface that lets the controllers daisy-chain together, which is how the big 64-character display will be controlled.
We’re looking forward to that, but in the meantime, enjoy the soft but pleasant flappy goodness of the clock in the brief video below.


Thanks for the review! Actually the larger display with 64 split-flaps is using one MCU with some shift registers. You can see the state of the build at the start of the year in my other article:
https://mcuoneclipse.com/2025/01/01/update-on-the-split-flap-project-for-2025/
So there is a shift register board for a group of 8 slit flaps, and one MCU driving all.
The previous build (https://mcuoneclipse.com/2022/01/09/diy-split-flap-display/) indeed used RS-485 with one MCU for 4 split flaps. Which would make 16 MCUs for a 64bit installation, which is clearly overpowered ;-). The shift register approach is more appropriate imho ;-).
This is lovely :)

Chinese manufacturer Lucky Film appears poised to release a new, original C-41 color negative film stock later this year, and distributors in North America are already revving the hype machine, seemingly unable to contain their excitement at the prospect of a new product from Lucky. 
That excitement is also causing what is being categorized as misinformation among possible distributors and is no doubt causing confusion among analog enthusiasts. 
To start with, China Lucky Film is the largest manufacturer of photosensitive materials, including consumer film, and (through subsidiaries) produces photo paper, laminating film, and more in China. While the brand isn’t as well-known as Kodak or Fujifilm in North America, its presence in China and Asia is much stronger. The company has not been as active in the consumer film space since the advent of digital cameras (although Lucky Film can still be found online from sources like AliExpress), but due to film’s resurgence, it restarted its color negative film production last year. 
According to distributors in both Canada and Taiwan, Lucky Film is restarting its focus on consumer 35mm film and will be releasing a brand-new C-41 stock later this year. Both OneSec in Canada and SunlitGem Development Corporation from Taiwan claim to be in contact with Lucky Film in China and are prepared to be distributors in North America. 
“Based on the information we have, the new product will likely be an ISO 200 standard color negative film compatible with 35mm/135-format cameras. Moreover, the film will utilize new materials developed with the latest technology, offering imaging performance that can surpass similar existing products! Once Lucky reach full production, the development quality and color accuracy are expected to be exceptional,” OneSec writes on its blog.
“In terms of pricing, the new film is expected to be highly affordable compared to similar products, making it a must-have for film enthusiasts. Additionally, Lucky offers a range of black-and-white films and color photographic papers. If there’s enough interest, we’ll bring these products to the North American market as well.”
The timing of the release has not been confirmed. According to Shane Chen, President of SunlitGem Development Corporation, who says he visited the factory in January, it could be upwards of a year before the stock is finished. 
“It all depends on the research and development results of the laboratory. It may be half a year, even a year, or it may happen immediately. So I don’t want to give any specific response on when it will be released this time. I don’t want to give everyone any more unnecessary expectations. Because I think friendship with you is more important than business. Just let us give time to make this wonderful thing happen,” Chen writes on the Lucky Film Photography Facebook Group.
This week, confirmation that the film was coming to North America seemed to arrive in the form of a new Lucky Film website.
“After over a decade, Lucky Color Film is making a comeback,” the website reads. “This year, Lucky is introducing a brand new, true original C-41 color negative 35mm film. We’re ready to claim a new legacy turning everyday moments into timeless images at a price today’s photographers can afford.”
The tone of the copy seems to be from an official source with direct ties to Lucky Film in China and is operating the Instagram handle luckyfilmglobal. 
“We are the U.S. team for Lucky Color Film, managing marketing and wholesale distribution across the Americas and Europe. As film enthusiasts ourselves, we recognize the significance of a new affordable film and are committed to connecting your local stores with the production to bring it back to the community,” the website says. 
At the same time, the aforementioned Shane Chen, who is based in Taiwan and operates the luckyfilm.photography handle on Instagram claims this is false.
“We are the legal global distributor,” Chen writes on Instagram (all spelling and punctuation are Chen’s). “There are currently no websites publishing other Lukcy film names. I have confirmed with the top management of Lucky group in China that some false new happened today. Lucky has NO team in the United Staets. officail people of Lucky won;t use IGeven this kind of website. Please do not believe rumors and false information, And please be careful. Rumors end at a wise person’s ears.” 


A post shared by Lucky Film (@luckyfilm.photography)

Chen has shared several photos from the Lucky factory in China, so it appears that he does have some legitimate relationship with the film company.
However, Lucky Film tells PetaPixel that Chen is attempting to control the narrative and it is he who is spreading the misinformation.
“We’ve been made aware that Shane Chen of SunlitGem (based in Taiwan) is spreading misinformation that we are ‘fake’ on his Instagram account ‘@luckyfilm.photography’ and Reddit. SunlitGem is a distribution shipper and Shane Chen is not an employee of China Lucky Group. As we speak with more retailers, it seems that Shane Chen has been purporting himself as ‘the’ Lucky to his customers for some time, which we find concerning,” Lucky Film tells PetaPixel in an email.
“We are indeed also a separate company, but we have that information front-and-center on our social media and website. The bigger difference is, we’ve been authorized with the trademark on the Lucky brand in the United States, allowing us to legally use the name and logo, and protecting us as the exclusive dealer to US retailers. When it comes to the international market, it’s a free game. If he can get his hands on supply, Shane Chen can sell wherever he pleases outside of the US. We’d be happy to work alongside him in serving the international film community, especially as we’re not planning to focus on the SHD B&W film, but we are disappointed by his unprofessional reaction to new competition.”
OneSec and LuckyFilm.net are closely related, the latter tells PetaPixel. That echos OneSec’s sentiments on its website: “For more updates on Lucky’s new film, follow us and visit luckyfilm.net.”
Neither LuckyFilm.net nor Shane Chen appear to be employees of Lucky Film in China, but as LuckyFilm.net says, it at least makes it clear that it is a separate company. 
Photographers should temper expectations until more information becomes available. One thing that does appear consistent in the messaging from both players is that Lucky Film is close to releasing a new film stock. 
The idea of a new, affordable color negative film is very exciting to analog photographers, which means that distributors are likely going to be fighting to make those sales once the film becomes available — that at least explains this infighting: money is a major factor.

The Nvidia RTX 5080 is out! Kind of. In theory. If you can find one. But here’s the thing: it's basically just an expensive RTX 4080 Super in disguise (in my opinion). Performance is near-identical, stock is non-existent, and unless you’re willing to shell out over $2,500 for a prebuilt system, good luck getting one.
So, what’s the smarter move? Well, how about an RTX 4080 Super instead? Similar performance, actual availability, and—oh look—there’s a prebuilt HP Omen 35L gaming PC with an RTX 4080 Super for $1,839.99 after applying the DUO20 coupon. That's around $800-$1000 less than most RTX 5080 systems, and you don’t have to fight scalpers for it either. Just select ""Graphics Card - RTX 4080 Super (+$600)"" to secure the correct setup at a discount.
$1839.99 (was $2619.99). Intel Core Ultra 5, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD. Use code DUO20 at checkout.
See here
This rig will demolish anything at 4K with ray tracing, and if you use Nvidia’s DLSS wizardry, you’ll squeeze even more frames out of it. The RTX 4080 Super itself is only about 5-10% faster than the standard 4080, which means it’s also just 5-10% slower than the RTX 5080. You’re basically getting the same high-end performance without the high-end hassle.
Otherwise, for an extra ~$400, you can step up to a Core Ultra 7, 32GB RAM, and a 2TB SSD with the upgraded HP Omen 35L config for $2264 (again, DUO20 applies). Or, if you want an absolute behemoth, the HP Omen 45L with a Core i7-14700K is also discounted to $2,299.99—though sadly, the coupon doesn’t work on this one.
$2263.99 (was $2899.99). Intel Core Ultra 7 285K, 32GB RAM, 2TB SSD. Use code DUO20 at checkout.
See here
In conclusion, unless you enjoy stress-shopping, the RTX 5080 just might not be worth the wait. You’re getting the same performance with the RTX 4080 Super, and deals like this make it an even better buy. Save money, game at 4K, and don’t let the GPU FOMO get to you.
For more deals, check out a discount on our favorite Steam Deck microSD card in the US and UK, a JSAUX Docking Station for Steam Deck, down to $23.99 at Amazon, alongside Civ VII preorders at 12% off, Kingdom Come Deliverance II for 10% off, and big savings on Doom: The Dark Ages if you buy today.

This type of financial burden is so prevalent that a 2022 study found 75% of those being treated for colorectal cancer experienced ""serious financial hardship"" during their first year of diagnosis.
Interestingly, almost all 380 participants had health insurance — meaning coverage doesn't necessarily shield patients from financial hardship and isn't always the path to quicker or better treatment, as lead study investigator, Veena Shankaran, M.D., M.S., of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, attested.
What's more, a survey from the Association of Oncology Social Work showed cancer treatment costs negatively impact the ability to focus on recovery for 87% of patients with major financial burdens from their treatment. Of them, 75% constantly worry about financial issues because of treatment costs.
If your spouse has health insurance, start there to see what you're covered for under their plan. If not, or it simply isn't enough, you might qualify for Medicaid, Medicare or Marketplace (Obamacare) insurance.
Medicaid is funded by states and the federal government, offering free or low-cost coverage to those with low incomes or disabilities. Eligibility varies by state and is determined by things like age, household income, assets, family size and disability.
Medicare is a federal insurance program for those aged 65 and up.
Patients of any age are covered through Medicaid if they've received SSDI for at least two years or if they have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or end-stage renal disease. Financial assistance may be available through ongoing programs like Extra Help/Part D Low-Income Subsidy and Medicare Savings.

Under the Affordable Care Act, private insurance plans are available from HealthCare.gov. There are specific enrollment periods with exceptions, like for those with household income under 150% of the federal poverty level.
Financial assistance may be available through cost-sharing and premium tax credit deductions.
For alternatives to insurance plans, here are other ways to lower your medical costs.
The [Patient Advocate Foundation(https://www.lls.org/partner/patient-advocate-foundation-paf) provides case management and mediation services, sometimes with the help of doctors and healthcare lawyers. They also offer financial assistance through a scholarship program and a co-pay relief program.
Most American hospitals have a financial assistance department. Reach out to yours to explain your situation and see what advice, support or suggestions they can offer.
By assessing your condition and financial situation, oncology social workers can make referrals to community agencies offering medical financial support, including to organizations with sliding scale fees.
The American Cancer Society keeps a list of resources to help cover cancer treatment and care expenses, which can include everything from transportation, meals and lodging, to day-to-day living costs like mortgage and childcare fees.
If available, explore the viability of participating in a relevant clinical trial. A study of cancer patients enrolled in clinical trials found a near-$6,000 savings per patient compared to those who were not, so it could be a good option.

Friday's job numbers may not be what you expect.

        The report is likely to show slower job growth from last year due to a regular update to the government's data — likely among the biggest payroll adjustments in years. But, if the numbers come as a surprise, they shouldn't raise alarm bells.
    

        TL;DR: In the January jobs report, the Bureau of Labor Statistics revises the previous year's jobs figures with more complete numbers. This year, revisions are expected to show a double whammy of fewer jobs than previously measured and a larger overall population due to updates in Census Bureau numbers. It could all look like a weaker 2024 job market than previously measured.
    

        The Bureau of Labor Statistics undertakes its benchmark revisions each yearin the January employment report. The government recalibrates its basic estimates of job growth over the previous few years based on more complete data reportedfrom businesses. This year's revisions are expected to show smaller job gains in 2024 than were previously reported.
    

        The BLS has already provided an idea of how itsnew calibration will impact payroll data. A report released by the BLS in August showed that there were around 800,000 fewer jobs across the US economy in March 2024 than previously reported, a larger-than-usual decline relative to the earlier figure.
    

        The headline monthly job growth numbers are based on a monthly survey of business establishments across the US. Any such survey measure represents an approximation of the underlying reality. The annual revisions recalibrate those surveys to more detailed but less timely measures of the full workforce based on administrative data like unemployment insurance records.
    

        It's a bit like searching around for something in a dark room, versus turning on a light. While the initial jobs report gives the best and most timely estimate for employment across the world's biggest economy based on a relatively small sample of businesses, the revisions reflect additional and more complete information that takes a longer time to gather.
    

        While these revisions happen every year, they've recently been relatively small. The below chart shows BLS payroll growth revisions for 2022 as reported in February 2023 and for 2023 as reported in February 2024. The revisions showed most months had larger job gains than reported earlier.
    

        The household survey, which makes up the other half of the monthly jobs report, is also set to receive a major update.
    

        That survey — which gathers information on Americans' socioeconomic health and provides the headline unemployment rate — will also be adjusted based on the Census Bureau's latest population estimates.
    

        Updated Census estimates will likely result in a dramatic apparent uptick in population and employment after the Census Bureau improved how it measures immigration to the US, leading to a larger-than-usual adjustment to the underlying count of how many people live in the country. An apparent increase in employment between December and January would have more to do with those changes in the way the Census calculates population, not any real spike in the workforce. This also makes it difficult to compare household survey data accurately over time.
    

        The likely upward jump in employment from the household survey and downward revision to payroll figures from the business survey could actually bring the two more in line with each other. For much of 2024, the business-derived employment figures suggested a rosier view of the labor market than those from the survey of workers. Combining the revisions together, we're likely to get a more coherent picture of a cooling but still decent job market.
    

        Still, any substantial jumps in job numbers are likely a result of normal, regularly scheduled data recalibrations instead of unexpected economic conditions.Over time, recalibrations allow the Census and BLS to more accurately represent changes in America's workforce.

42,2025-02-07,"The man who coined the term “Magnificent Seven,” which refers to seven high-performing tech stocks — Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) — now believes its golden era is about to end, and that’s due to the AI battle driven by DeepSeek. 
Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist at Bank of America (BAC) Global Research, warned in his latest note that the U.S. stock market’s global dominance will peak in 2025 and is nearing its end.
Read here: Which stocks are in the Magnificent 7?
The arrival of DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence startup that has developed AI models comparable to those of OpenAI but apparently at a fraction of the cost and energy, has caused turmoil in the stock market, leading to a significant sell-off in the tech sector. In his note, Hartnett indicated that spending on artificial intelligence is expected to reach its peak soon.
“US exceptionalism now exceptionally expensive, exceptionally well-owned,” the strategist wrote. “‘Magnificent 7’ becomes ‘Lagnificent 7,’ supports broadening of US and global equity and credit markets.”
Beyond AI, Hartnett sees other key drivers of U.S. market outperformance—such as excess fiscal support and immigration—waning this year. He doubts U.S. stocks will continue to outpace global markets, citing an expected slowdown in government spending and tighter immigration policies.
Fiscal spending has been high in recent years, but President Trump is now pushing for extensive cuts, even creating the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), now led by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. 
Hartnett has advised investors to seek cheaper international markets instead of pursuing overpriced U.S. stocks. He noted that equities from Brazil, Germany, the UK, and Canada have provided higher returns than Wall Street’s S&P 500-listed stocks.

Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA) recently reported its Q3 fiscal 2025 results (fiscal ends in March), with revenues missing and earnings exceeding the street estimates. The company reported net bookings of $2.22 billion and earnings of $1.11 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $2.32 billion and $1.08, respectively. Softer demand for its game Dragon Age weighed on the overall performance. The company lowered its full-year outlook. On the positive side, it announced an accelerated $1 billion share repurchase plan, which boded well for its stock.
EA stock, with -4% returns since the beginning of 2024, has underperformed the S&P 500 index, up 27%. This can be attributed to a broader decline in gaming demand. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.
Electronic Arts’ revenue of $1.9 billion in Q3 was down 3% y-o-y. This can partly be attributed to a lower contribution of extra content from EA Sports FC Ultimate Team and Apex Legends. The demand for football gaming as well as Dragon Age was softer than anticipated. Electronic Arts saw its operating margin expand by 120 bps to 20% in Q3. Its profit of $1.11 per share in Q3’25, reflected a 4% rise from its $1.07 figure in the prior-year quarter. Not only did Electronic Arts post a mixed Q3, its outlook for fiscal 2025 was softer than anticipated. The company expects its bookings to be in the range of $7.0 billion and $7.15 billion and adjusted earnings to be in the range of $6.25 and $6.65 per share in fiscal 2025. This compares with $7.4 billion in bookings and $6.92 adjusted earnings per share it reported in fiscal 2024.
EA stock surged 8% post the Q3 announcement, primarily reflecting the investor optimism from its share buyback plan. Looking at a slightly longer time frame, the performance of EA stock with respect to the index over the last four-year period has been lackluster. Returns for the stock were -8% in 2021, -7% in 2022, 13% in 2023, and 7% in 2024.
In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and trade wars, could EA face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2023, and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? We estimate Electronic Arts’ Valuation to be $142 per share, around 9% above its current market price. Our forecast is based on 21x forward expected earnings of $6.71 for EA in 2025. The 21x figure aligns with the stock’s average P/E ratio over the last five years.
While EA stock looks like it has little room for growth, it is helpful to see how Electronic Arts’ Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

In his first weeks in office, President Donald Trump has sought to take a wrecking ball to climate and environmental policy. He has directed his administration to roll back a wide range of regulations and aims to undercut the agencies that enforce them by targeting staff. 
The moves, he claims, will free businesses of ballooning compliance costs and allow them to prosper. “Overregulation stops American entrepreneurship, crushes small business, reduces consumer choice, discourages innovation, and infringes on the liberties of American citizens,” reads a White House fact sheet explaining the deregulatory agenda. 
Some companies may celebrate, particularly smaller firms where compliance costs have an outsized influence on the bottomline. But the speed and scale of the effort to nix climate regulations also comes at a price—and not just for efforts to cut emissions. Businesses rely on stable policy regimes to invest and grow their business. And, right now, any company with even a tangential connection to climate and energy is feeling a good deal of uncertainty. 
Despite the real financial costs of all this uncertainty, most corporations are reluctant to speak up publicly even as they fret behind closed doors. Trump can always make things worse—going as far as to target specific companies that get in his way—and so executives are learning to stay quiet. 
But in regulatory filings, where companies are legally required to speak plainly about risks to their business, companies warn about the financial consequences from rapid climate policy shifts. The Ford Motor Company lists the back-and-forth on climate policy between administrations in a section on “legal and regulatory risks” that might materially affect their business. Bank of America alludes to the “divergent views of stakeholders” on climate chances and warns that “heightened legal and compliance risk” now comes from all sides as the firm works on climate. Dow, the chemical company, lists climate change among its business risks, including “changes in public sentiment and political leadership, including government incentives and tax credits to promote emission reductions.”
After the election, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods told Semafor that the U.S. needs a more consistent approach.“The polarization and political back-and-forth that we see in [the U.S.] is not good for the country, not good for society. It’s frankly not good for business,” he said. “What we need is more thoughtful, consistent regulation.”
Even changes that many companies are upbeat about—think of faster permitting for energy infrastructure—come with significant risks. For one, it may be difficult to rapidly permit projects if the workforce responsible for doing so has been fired. But, perhaps more importantly in the long term, is the question of what will hold up in court. Much of what the Trump Administration does through a flurry of executive action will be contested, and the time it takes to see that play out has a cost as companies remain in limbo unsure how to deploy their funds.   
In the first week of the Trump presidency, I highlighted the complexities of his anti-climate push—most importantly that his moves will face off against the realities of the market. But it’s also true that in light of the urgency of climate change, even just gumming up the market can have a meaningful effect, slowing down the pace of the green transition.

46,2025-02-07,"Big savings on big storage.
Running out of space on your Steam Deck or ROG Ally X again? Sitting there, deleting games like it's some emotional farewell? Stop that. Your least favorite RPS writer found a ridiculous Amazon deal on our favorite microSD card for Steam Deck, the Samsung Pro Plus.
For a limited time, you can grab this lightning-fast, ultra-reliable microSD card for just $39.99 in the US (47% off, down from $75.99) or £40.99 in the UK (45% off, down from £73.99). It's precisely what you need to never make those tough choices on what remains on the Deck, ever again.
$39.99 / £40.99 (was $75.99 / £73.99) 
See here
While we're at it, let's look at the alternatives as well, because while this is our favorite microSD card for Steam Deck, and is also on sale, it's not the cheapest going. Check out the TeamGroup A2 Pro Plus Card 512GB if you're looking for those additional savings, as it's $29.99 right now as well.
For most games, the primary difference is in load times; performance, like framerates, remains largely unaffected when using a microSD card. However, some games that leverage the high speeds of SSDs—such as Cyberpunk 2077 with its open-world streaming and Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart with its dimension-hopping sequences—may experience slight delays when loading scenes from a microSD card. These delays are nearly imperceptible when using an SSD.
That said, these examples are quite rare. A notable exception is Starfield, which demands an SSD even on high-end desktops. Since it doesn’t perform well on the Steam Deck’s hardware regardless, storage speed is less of an issue. The majority of your game library should run perfectly fine from a microSD card.
This isn't some cheap, no-name SD card that turns loading screens into endurance tests either. 180MB/s read and 130MB/s write speeds mean your games load fast, run smoothly, and keep up with your reflexes. It is A2-rated for rapid app performance, UHS-I, U3, and V30 certified, and built for speed, so even big open-world titles won't slow you down. The UK deal also throws in a USB card reader for extra convenience.
Are you worried about durability? Don't be. This card is waterproof, temperature-proof, X-ray-proof, magnet-proof, and drop-proof. Unless you drop it into an active volcano, it is fine. And with Samsung's 10-year warranty, you're covered even if the impossible happens.
If you're smart, grab this while you can. 512GB is the sweet spot for portable gaming, giving you plenty of room for your AAA library, indie gems, and massive updates that get bigger every year. You could keep stressing over storage or fix the problem once and for all. Your Steam Deck, ROG Ally X, and gaming sanity will thank you.
Uncle Christian is giving it his all, so continue to bring the fire in the comments ladies and gentleman, I can take it. Other top deals right now we want to highlight include a JSAUX Docking Station for Steam Deck, down to $23.99 at Amazon, alongside Civ VII preorders at 12% off, Kingdom Come Deliverance II for 10% off, and big savings on Doom: The Dark Ages if you buy today. There's also new stock available for RTX 5080 pre-built PCs, if you're in the market for one.

As we enter into the new year, the economic landscape is changing faster than ever. Business owners will need to adapt to an unpredictable economic climate and rapid advances in technology if they want to stay competitive. This is true whether you’re running a small brick-and-mortar shop or a tech startup.
Companies need to learn how to handle things such as the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), shifting demographics and ongoing geopolitical conflicts. Let’s look at five major trends business owners will want to keep an eye on in 2025.
In mid-January, the president announced a new AI infrastructure investment in the U.S. OpenAI, Oracle, SoftBank and others are partnering to form a new company called Stargate, which will begin building data centers and infrastructure across the country. The companies will invest $100 billion up front, with the goal of investing $500 billion over the next four years.
OpenAI says the venture could create hundreds of thousands of new American jobs. The first data centers are already under construction in Texas, and the ultimate goal is to build out 20 new data centers. Oracle, SoftBank, Nvidia and Microsoft all saw their stock prices rise following the announcement.
The project is significant because it represents a shift in how individuals, businesses and governments leverage this technology. Advanced AI infrastructure should better enable companies to process their data more efficiently and without expensive hardware. It could also spur innovation across the healthcare, finance and manufacturing industries.
The new administration has levied tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. By imposing tariffs on foreign-made goods, the administration hopes to incentivize companies to manufacture products within the U.S.
Tariffs and trade policies could affect U.S. and global markets in a number of ways. Many economists warn they’ll lead to an increase in consumer prices since tariffs are inflationary in nature. There’s also a concern that tariffs could disrupt global trade and lead to a global economic slowdown.
However, tariffs could protect American industries and protect more jobs in certain sectors. Tariffs also provide the government with an additional revenue stream, which could create a short-term economic boost.
Businesses should prepare by assessing their supply chain vulnerabilities and building partnerships with multiple vendors.
Another big question is whether the Federal Reserve will continue to lower interest rates in 2025. Inflation increased to 2.7%, and at the most recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, the Fed projected only two rate cuts in 2025. If interest rates do continue to drop, this could drive stock prices higher and encourage more borrowing and business investments.
However, if inflation remains above the Fed’s 2% target, the Fed may choose to hold or even increase the Federal Funds rate. Should interest rates increase, companies would face higher borrowing costs, which could reduce their investments and profits.
Further rate cuts aren’t expected until early March. If you anticipate needing a small-business loan or line of credit, it may be a good idea to apply now instead of waiting in hopes of securing a lower rate in the future.
Geopolitical tensions have the ability to cause disruptions, especially if the countries in which the U.S. imposes tariffs choose to take retaliatory measures. Geopolitical conflicts can disrupt trade and limit the availability of certain essential products.
One of the biggest unknowns is what will happen with the conflict in Ukraine. If it is resolved peacefully, this could put an end to geopolitical uncertainty and improve trade routes in Eastern Europe. It could also stabilize the global energy markets, potentially lowering oil and gas prices.
The workforce is undergoing significant changes thanks to demographic shifts. A growing portion of Americans are over the age of 65, and Pew Research found that many of these individuals are staying in the workforce. That’s partly because older adults today are healthier than previous generations, and changes to the Social Security system discourage early retirement.
At the same time, Gen Z and millennials make up more than 50% of the workforce. Business owners will have to learn how to adopt strategies for attracting younger hires while still leveraging the skills of older workers. They’ll also need to create an environment that values different perspectives and experiences.

48,2025-02-07,"The emotional Google Pixel 9 ad will air this Sunday. 

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Ahead of the Super Bowl this Sunday, Feb. 9, Google shared its slate of advertisements showcasing Pixel phones and Gemini software in a blog post. The commercial that will air during the game, titled ""Dream Job,"" debut 15 years after Google's first-ever ad was screened alongside the Super Bowl.
It's an emotional piece showing how the conversational Gemini Live can help everyday people prep for interviews, and there are already over 100 comments under the YouTube video talking about how it made viewers feel. In the company's own words, ""Dream Job"" follows a father prepping for an interview who ""taps into the valuable lessons he’s learned as a parent, transforming his experiences into compelling answers and boosting his confidence.""
Meanwhile, Google is rolling a separate ""Party Blitz"" commercial on digital channels and social media. It follows a boyfriend trying to hold his own during the Super Bowl with a comical amount of football knowledge in front of his girlfriend's family and friends. ""Even though the boyfriend ends up fumbling at times, it's a relatable story that shows how AI can help you navigate unexpected situations with a little more knowledge,"" Google writes.
Both of these ad spots highlight how Gemini Live works on the Google Pixel 9 series. Gemini Live is a conversational voice assistant that leverages AI to communicate with users with natural language, making it more accessible than traditional AI chatbots. After debuting exclusively for Google One AI Premium subscribers last year, it then became available for free to all users in October 2024.
There will be quite a few appearances from Google before and during the Super Bowl. You can keep an eye out for a pre-game YouTube commercial to kick things off. As announced in January, Google will also run 50 ads in as many local markets to highlight how small business use Gemini in Workspace in their home market. Finally, the company has creator content and in-game experiences planned for the once-in-a-year event.
""As people all across the U.S. come together this Sunday, Gemini Live on Pixel can help you learn, plan, create and get things done — even if it’s just mastering football trivia,"" the company writes.

Honeywell (NYSE: HON) recently released its Q4 results, with revenues and earnings exceeding the street estimates. It reported sales of $10.1 billion and adjusted earnings of $2.47 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $9.9 billion and $2.32, respectively. The company benefited from strong building automation sales. However, Honeywell’s outlook for 2025 fell short of expectations. Honeywell has announced plans to reorganize into three separate companies: Honeywell Automation, Honeywell Aerospace, and Advanced Materials. This restructuring decision follows activist investor Elliott Management’s push for change at the company. Separately, after a cautious outlook, What’s Happening With Amazon Stock?
HON stock, with 2% returns since the beginning of 2024, has underperformed the S&P 500 index, up 28%.

If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.

Honeywell’s segment profit margin of 20.9% in Q4’24 declined by 350 bps y-o-y. This resulted in the bottom line of $2.47, down 8% y-o-y. Looking forward, Honeywell expects its full-year 2025 sales to be in the range of $39.6 billion to $40.6 billion, and its adjusted earnings to be in the range of $10.10 and $10.50, falling short of the consensus estimate of $10.91.
A bleak outlook didn’t sit well with the investors, and HON stock dropped 6% post the results announcement. Even if we look at a slightly longer time frame, the performance of HON stock with respect to the index over the recent years has been quite volatile.
In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and ongoing trade wars, could HON face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2023, and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? While we will soon update our model to reflect the latest results, HON stock seems to be undervalued. At its current levels of around $210, it’s trading at 21x trailing earnings of $9.89 per share, versus the stock’s average P/E ratio of 25x. We believe that the current valuation discount presents an attractive entry point for investors seeking robust long-term returns in HON stock.
While HON stock appears to have some room for growth, it is helpful to see how Honeywell’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

	No movie theaters want to run the trailer for Johnny Knoxville and Josh Hutcherson‘s dark satire, Duhpocalypse. Their reluctance could have something to do with the undead opponents they battle in the clip when they encounter zombies with explosive diarrhea. That’s where Seth Rogen comes in, and the trailer inception begins: Duhpocalypse is the latest fake film being pushed by the fake movie studio at the center of The Studio, Rogen’s forthcoming Apple TV+ series premiering March 26.

	“I definitely want that diarrhea explosion in the trailer,” Rogen insists during a meeting at Continental Studios. He’s the newly-appointed head of the studio, and he’s inheriting what Kathryn Hahn’s character refers to as a “trailer crisis.”

	How do you market a movie about zombies with violent dysentery without showing Hutcherson getting “dooked,” wondering if he’s going to die, and Knoxville speeding up the process with a sword? “Are we losing the point of the film in the comedy?” Knoxville asks the boardroom. “We made a dark satire about medical disinformation, and I don’t want that to get lost.” 

	










	They could take some notes from The Studio itself. Earlier this year, Rogen and Catherine O’Hara attended the Golden Globes to boast about all of the fake awards they won for films that don’t exist. “Catherine won not one, but two Golden Antlers for her work as Mama Morissette in the Alanis Morissette story,” Rogen joked before O’Hara added, “What about you and your brave Golden Antler win for your turn as young Ryan, yes, in Gosling, the Ryan Gosling unauthorized biopic?”

The Studio stars Rogen, Hahn, O’Hara, Ike Barinholtz, Chase Sui Wonders, Bryan Cranston, Keyla Monterroso Mejia, and Dewayne Perkins. A synopsis for the series reads: “Desperate for the approval of celebrities, he and his team of executives at Continental Studios must juggle corporate demands with creative ambitions as they try to keep movies alive and relevant.”

US stocks were little changed on Friday as investors digested a highly anticipated monthly jobs report and Amazon's (AMZN) disappointing revenue outlook.
The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) hovered just above the flatline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was slightly higher on the heels of a mixed day for stocks on Wall Street.
The US economy added 143,000 jobs in January, missing economist expectations, but still showing signs of resiliancy. The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.0%, from 4.1% in the prior month.
The jobs report has become more crucial to hopes for another Federal Reserve interest-rate cut. Investors are watching for cracks in the market's stability, as they eye President Donald Trump's tariff push and the chances of higher inflation.
But Friday's reading likely won't be a game-changer, as economists are keeping alive bets that no rate cut will arrive until the central bank's June meeting.
Meanwhile, eyes were on Amazon's (AMZN) earnings after it joined Google (GOOG) and other AI-focused Big Tech companies in disappointing Wall Street with its revenue outlook. Shares in Amazon dropped more than 2% in early trading, echoing post-results pullbacks for Google and AMD (AMD) amid doubts about high AI development spending.
But the three major stock gauges are on track to close the earnings-packed week with small gains, even after unpredictable tariff news from Trump kept traders on their toes.
The president has now set his eyes on hedge funds, with a plan to close a favorite tax deduction loophole for fund managers. An adjustment to the closely watched state and local tax (SALT) deduction was also on his administration's list of tax priorities outlined on Thursday.
Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports:
The US labor market showed continued signs of resilience in January as the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell and wages grew more than expected.
Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics released Friday showed the unemployment rate fell to 4% in January from 4.1% the month prior.
143,000 new jobs were created in January, less than the 170,000 expected by economists, and lower than the 307,000 seen in December. December's monthly job gains were revised higher from a previous reading of 256,000.

Stocks in Europe wavered on Friday but were on track for weekly gains after a run of robust earnings reports from Novo Nordisk (NVO, NOVO-B.CO) and others.
The pan-European Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) index was holding steady, not far off record highs as it eyed its seventh weekly win in a row. In 2025 so far, European stocks have notched their best performance compared with their US counterparts in around 10 years.
In individual benchmarks, Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) edged up 0.1%, while the CAC (^FCHI) in Paris traded flat.
London's FTSE 100 index (^FTSE) slipped roughly 0.3%, after surging on Thursday on the heels of an interest rate cut by the Bank of England that came with unexpectedly dovish commentary.
Economic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls (January); Unemployment rate (January); Average hourly earnings and Average weekly hours worked (January); Labor force participation rate (January); Annual revisions to the employment establishment survey expected; University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey (February preliminary)
Earnings: Canopy Growth (CGC), Newell Brands (NWL)

The shares of diversified mining giant Rio Tinto (NYSE: RIO) has gained 5% year to date, outperforming the S&P500 index which has grown 3% during the same period. Rio Tinto is making a significant push into lithium to strengthen its position in the battery metals market. The company recently announced a $2.5 billion investment to expand its Rincon lithium project in Argentina, aiming to increase production capacity to 60,000 tonnes per year of battery-grade lithium carbonate. The mine, located in Argentina’s “lithium triangle,” is expected to have a 40-year lifespan, with production starting in 2028 and full capacity reached by 2031.
Additionally, Rio Tinto recently completed a $6.7 billion acquisition of Arcadium Lithium, positioning itself as the world’s third-largest lithium miner after Albemarle and SQM. The acquisition gives Rio a stronger foothold in Asia, where 84% of Arcadium’s revenue is generated, benefiting from rising demand for electric vehicle batteries.
This lithium expansion aligns with Argentina’s pro-investment policies, including tax incentives and regulatory stability for large foreign investments. However, the move comes amid weaker lithium prices, driven by oversupply from China and slowing EV demand, which has led other lithium projects to be delayed or canceled.
Overall, the performance of RIO stock with respect to the index over the last 4-year period has been quite volatile. Returns for the stock were -1% in 2021, 18% in 2022, 11% in 2023, and -15% in 2024.
 The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period.
Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could RIO face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2023 and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump?
Rio’s Q4 2024 operational results showed mixed performance across its key commodities. Pilbara iron ore production was 86.5 million tonnes, while shipments totaled 85.7 million tonnes, reflecting a 1% decline year-over-year due to depletion at certain sites and a transition to the Western Range mine​. Mined copper production surged 13% year-over-year to 697,000 tonnes, driven by the ramp-up of Oyu Tolgoi underground operations and better ore grades at Escondida. Q4 alone saw 202,000 tonnes, a 26% increase from Q4 2023. While the company continues to focus on growth in battery and renewable materials, we currently value Rio Tinto stock at about $77 per share, which is 25% ahead of the current market price.

57,2025-02-07,"The Eli Lilly logo appears on the screen of a smartphone in Reno, United States, on December 12, ... [+] 2024 (Photo by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images).
Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) fourth-quarter performance exceeded the street expectations, with the company delivering adjusted earnings of $5.32 per share versus the projected $4.95. Revenue came in at $13.5 billion, slightly below the consensus estimate of $13.6 billion. Lower price realization for Mounjaro led to a top-line miss. As an aside, see What’s Next for HON Stock?
Eli Lilly’s outlook aligned with the analysts estimates. This boded well with the investors, and the stock trended higher after the results’ announcement. Now, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.
Eli Lilly’s revenue of $13.5 billion reflected a solid 45% y-o-y growth, thanks to the high demand for its obesity drug – Zepbound – which garnered $1.9 billion in sales. Among other drugs, Mounjaro sales were up 60% y-o-y to $3.5 billion, while Verzenio saw a 36% jump to $1.6 billion. Notably, both Zepbound and Mounjaro sales fell short of the consensus estimates of $1.98 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. While Mounjaro’s sales demonstrated strong growth, pricing challenges tempered its overall performance.
Eli Lilly also posted a 90 bps improvement in gross margin to 83.2% in Q4. Higher revenues clubbed with margin expansion resulted in earnings of $5.32 per share, up over 2x from the $2.49 figure in the prior-year quarter. Looking forward, the company expects its top-line to be in the range of $58 billion and $61 billion, gross margin between 41.5% and 43.5%, and the adjusted earnings to be between $22.50 and $24.00.
LLY has delivered impressive returns of 50% year-to-date, significantly outpacing the S&P 500’s 28% gain in the same period. The investor optimism stems from massive demand for its obesity treatment. Admirably, LLY stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last four years. Returns for the stock were 66% in 2021, 34% in 2022, 61% in 2023, and 33% in 2024.
Similarly, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile, and it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and changes in the White House, could LLY continue to outperform? From a valuation perspective, we think LLY stock has some room for growth. At its current levels of $870, LLY stock trades at 17x trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of 14x over the last three years. Now, a rise in valuation multiple for LLY seems justified, given the strong sales growth as well as robust outlook in the coming years. Notably, the $980 average of analysts price estimate for LLY reflects a 12% upside from here.

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) surpassed street expectations from its fourth quarter performance, delivering revenue of $187.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.86 - topping analysts’ projections of $187.3 billion and $1.49, respectively. While Amazon Web Services remained a key growth driver, the company provided a cautious first-quarter forecast that could potentially pressure its stock price in the near term. Separately, after a good fourth quarter should you Buy, Sell, Or Hold LLY Stock At $870?
AMZN stock, with 57% returns since the beginning of 2024, has outperformed the S&P 500 index, up 28%. The company’s substantial investments in rebuilding its infrastructure over recent years are now yielding results, which is evident from the improvement in operating profits. This has boded well for its stock. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.
Amazon’s revenue of $187.8 billion in Q4 reflected a 10% y-o-y growth. Looking at segments, North America saw a 10% rise to $115.6 billion, International sales were up 8% to $43.4 billion, and AWS saw a 19% jump to $28.8 billion. Amazon also saw its operating margin expand by 350 bps y-o-y to 11.3% in Q4, thanks to an uptick in its high-margin AWS business. Higher revenues clubbed with margin expansion resulted in the bottom line of $1.86, up 86% y-o-y.
Amazon’s first-quarter revenue guidance ranges between $151 billion and $155.5 billion, falling short of analysts’ expectations of $158.5 billion. This forecast includes an anticipated negative impact of $2.1 billion from unfavorable foreign exchange movements. Furthermore, the company raised its capital expenditures to $100 billion this year, reflecting its continued investments in AI. Amazon is focused on expanding its infrastructure to keep pace with the surging demand for generative AI services.
Although Amazon posted an upbeat Q4, its stock is trading lower in after-hour trading amid a bleak Q1 outlook. Even if we look at a slightly longer period, the increase in AMZN stock over the last four-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500.
In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts, impending tariff wars, and the rise of DeepSeek, could AMZN face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? While we will soon update our model for Amazon, to reflect the latest results, we think its stock has little room for growth. At its current levels of around $230, AMZN is already trading at 3.9x trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of 3.2x over the last five years. Investors have awarded Amazon a premium to its historical valuation multiple, reflecting the company’s enhanced profitability. In light of Amazon’s recent performance and future outlook, we see limited opportunity for its valuation multiple to expand further. Also, check out our note on What’s Happening With GOOG Stock?
While AMZN stock looks like it has little room for growth, it is helpful to see how Amazon’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

The Super Bowl is a big event for Tubi, which is streaming the game for free: It's a chance for the service to introduce itself to a huge audience that might know little, or nothing at all, about the Fox-owned streamer.

        But if Tubi isn't a household name throughout the US, it definitely has pockets of fandom throughout the country. One particularly big pocket: Black audiences.
    

        Nielsen says nearly half of all viewing — 45% — on Tubi came from Black audiences in December. That's a much bigger percentage of Black viewers than any other streamer — which saw an average Black audience of 19.5% in December — and it's also much bigger than old-line TV — which saw an average 16.4%.
    

        For context: Tubi says it reaches about 100 million monthly users. And it routinely challenges or beats the likes of Peacock, Paramount+, and Max in Nielsen's streaming ratings.
    

        All of which puts Tubi and its corporate parent in a slightly weird spot: It most definitely doesn't position itself publicly as a streamer that appeals to Black audiences. But if you ask company executives about it, they're happy to discuss it.
    

        ""We have real momentum with Black audiences, and we're really proud of that,"" says Tubi CEO Anjali Sud.
    

        So on the one hand, that means Tubi is intentionally looking for movies and TV shows it thinks will appeal to Black viewers. On the other hand, Tubi insists that it's interested in servicing all kinds of niches, like gay and lesbian viewers, or Gen Z viewers.
    

        Tubi's popularity with Black audiences existed before Fox acquired the company for $440 million in March 2020. Farhad Massoudi, Tubi's cofounder and former CEO, didn't set out to make a streamer that appealed to Black viewers. He was just interested in building a streaming service that relied on software and algorithms to tell him what people watched.
    

        ""We do have a huge African American audience, and basically, our data showed that there is a big demand from those users, and we decided to lean in,"" he told me in July 2020.
    

        Sud, who took over Tubi in 2023, says she's continued in the same vein. Tubi has actively tried to buy and develop material it thinks will appeal to Black audiences. But she thinks it can do the same for other audiences: ""We believe we can achieve the same kind of resonance with other audiences,"" she says. ""But we got the signal faster with Black audiences.""
    

        Tubi's appeal to Black viewers hasn't gone unnoticed by its competitors, some of whom try to turn it into a negative. Talk to folks about Tubi at rival streamers and you'll hear references to ""audience quality"" — a suggestion that marketers won't pay as much to reach a Tubi viewer.
    

        Sud, not surprisingly, says that's not true: ""There's only one metric that matters in terms of quality. That's engagement.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - Porsche AG shares fell 7% in early Friday trade after the luxury carmaker forecast a preliminary profit margin of 10%-12% for 2025, far below expectations, as it struggles to boost flagging sales and weak demand in China.
The forecast was a ""major concern"" for the carmaker, said Bernstein Research analyst Stephen Reitman, after its executives touted 17%-19% as its mid-term margin target at its stock market debut in 2022.
Porsche AG said in a statement late on Thursday that it plans to launch new combustion engine and plug-in hybrid models, the latest carmaker to pivot back towards combustion engine vehicles amid low demand for EVs in Europe and intense competition in China from local rivals.
The costs of vehicle development, and battery-related expenses at a subsidiary, would knock about 800 million euros ($830 million) off 2025 operating profit, the company said.
Porsche in October 2024 invested 60 million euros in struggling German battery maker Varta to secure access to high-performance batteries.
SLUMPING SHARES
Porsche AG's stock market valuation has tumbled since its listing, with shares slumping 27% in 2024.
The company said last week it was in talks to end the contracts of its chief financial officer and sales chief early, after both came under heavy criticism for the company's poor performance and weak share price.
While 75% of the carmaker's share capital is owned by Volkswagen AG, just over 12.5% is held by Porsche SE, an investment firm controlled by the Piech and Porsche families and which is also the top shareholder of Volkswagen.
Porsche SE said on Thursday it expects impairments on its stake in Porsche AG nearly double the size of its December forecast, reaching 2.5 billion euros to 3.5 billion euros.
The holding firm also said it expects writedowns related to Volkswagen, which is undergoing major cost cuts, towards the upper limit of its forecast range of 7 billion to 20 billion euros.

Elon Musk's X has signed a partnership with the adtech company Magnite, the latest in a string of deals it has signed with programmatic advertising firms, Business Insider has learned.

        Magnite operates a supply-side platform, technology that helps web publishers, app developers, and streaming TV providers manage and sell advertising. It's one of the largest SSPs in the US by market share, according to the analytics platform Pixalate.
    

        A spokesperson for Magnite confirmed the partnership with X and said it offers advertisers an option to include or exclude X's inventory from their media buys.
    

        X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
    

        Magnite joins Google and PubMatic as official third-party sellers of X's ad inventory. X had also previously forged a partnership with InMobi, but the adtech company hasn't offered ads on X for well over a year, as BI previously reported.
    

        By opening up its ad inventory to partners, X can theoretically tap into additional advertiser demand — including companies that may not have previously considered buying X or other social-media ads.
    

        It could help fill gaps that X's sales team and self-service buying platform couldn't sell. That said, it's likely these would be bought at a lower price, and X would have to share some of that revenue with its adtech partners.
    

        Prior to Musk's takeover of the company (previously called Twitter), it only sold directly and didn't make its inventory available to third-party adtech vendors.
    

        X has been working to reverse the large revenue shortfall that came as many advertisers pulled or dramatically reduced their spending on the platform after Musk's takeover of the company in 2022. X laid off swaths of its safety and sales staff, loosened content moderation rules, switched up its verification system, and allowed previously banned accounts back onto the platform.
    

        Musk's own behavior toward advertisers has sometimes not been cordial. He famously told companies that had pulled advertising from X to ""go fuck yourself"" during a 2023 onstage interview. X is also currently suing 11 advertisers, alleging they collectively conspired to boycott X through their membership in a now-defunct trade body initiative called the Global Alliance for Responsible Media.
    

        MediaRadar, a marketing intelligence firm, estimated that X's US advertising revenue came in at $1.4 billion in 2024, down 28% from the nearly $2 billion spent on the platform in 2023. The number of companies advertising on X in 2024 increased 15% year-over-year, per MediaRadar, which analyzes a panel of more than 2 million US users.
    

        Despite some struggles on the advertising side, X remains an influential platform under Musk, who has been in the spotlight as a powerful political figure following President Donald Trump's reelection.
    

        Magnite stock closed up over 10% on Friday following BI breaking news of the partnership.

63,2025-02-07,"The UK government has demanded to be able to access encrypted data stored by Apple users worldwide in its cloud service.
Currently only the Apple account holder can access data stored in this way - the tech giant itself cannot view it.
The demand has been served by the Home Office under the Investigatory Powers Act (IPA), which compels firms to provide information to law enforcement agencies.
Apple declined to comment, but says on its website, external that it views privacy as a ""fundamental human right"".
Under the law, the demand cannot be made public. 
The news was first reported by the Washington Post, external quoting sources familiar with the matter, and the BBC has spoken to similar contacts.
The Home Office said: ""We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices.""
Privacy International called it an ""unprecedented attack"" on the private data of individuals.
""This is a fight the UK should not have picked,"" said the charity's legal director Caroline Wilson Palow.
""This overreach sets a hugely damaging precedent and will embolden abusive regimes the world over.""
The demand applies to all content stored using what Apple calls ""Advanced Data Protection"" (ADP).
This uses something called end-to-end encryption, where only the account holder can access the data stored - even Apple itself cannot see it.
It is an opt-in service, and not all users choose to activate it. 
This is because, while it makes your data more secure, it comes with a downside - it encrypts your data so heavily that it cannot be recovered if you lose access to your account.
It is unknown how many people choose to use ADP.
It's also important to note that the government notice does not mean the authorities are suddenly going to start combing through everybody's data.
It is believed that the government would want to access this data if there were a risk to national security - in other words, it would be targeting an individual, rather than using it for mass surveillance.
Authorities would still have to follow a legal process, have a good reason and request permission for a specific account in order to access data - just as they do now with unencrypted data.
Apple has previously said it would pull encryption services like ADP from the UK market rather than comply with such government demands - telling Parliament it would ""never build a back door"" in its products.
Cyber security experts agree that once such an entry point is in place, it is only a matter of time before bad actors also discover it.
And withdrawing the product from the UK might not be enough to ensure compliance - the Investigatory Powers Act applies worldwide to any tech firm with a UK market, even if they are not based in Britain.
Still, no Western government has yet been successful in attempts to force big tech firms like Apple to break their encryption.
The US government has previously asked for this, but Apple has pointedly refused.
In 2016, Apple resisted a court order to write software which would allow US officials to access the iPhone of a gunman - though this was resolved after the FBI were able to successfully access the device.
That same year, the US dropped a similar case after it was able to gain access by discovering the person's passcode.
Similar cases have followed, including in 2020, when Apple refused to unlock iPhones of a man who carried out a mass shooting at a US air base.
The FBI later said it had been able to ""gain access"" to the phones.
The tech giant can appeal against the government's demand but cannot delay implementing the ruling during the process even if it is eventually overturned, according to the legislation.
The government argues that encryption enables criminals to hide more easily, and the FBI in the US has also been critical of the ADP tool.
Professor Alan Woodward, cyber security expert from Surrey University, said he was ""stunned"" by the news, and privacy campaigners Big Brother Watch described the reports as ""troubling"".
""This misguided attempt at tackling crime and terrorism will not make the UK safer, but it will erode the fundamental rights and civil liberties of the entire population,"" the group said in a statement.
UK children's charity the NSPCC has previously described encryption as being on the front line of child abuse because it enables abusers to share hidden content.
But Apple says that privacy for its customers is at the heart of all its products and services.
In 2024 the company contested proposed changes to the Investigatory Powers Act, calling it an ""unprecedented overreach"" of a government. 
The changes also included giving the government the power to veto new security measures before they were implemented. They were passed into law.
""The main issue that comes from such powers being exercised is that it's unlikely to result in the outcome they want,"" said Lisa Forte, cyber security expert from Red Goat.
""Criminals and terrorists will just pivot to other platforms and techniques to avoid incrimination. So it's the average, law abiding citizen who suffers by losing their privacy.""

64,2025-02-07,"Reliable and dependable transportation these days is not cheap. The average monthly car payment is $737 for new vehicles and $525 for pre-owned options. With numbers like that staring them down, buyers might assume that the lowest price tag in their category is always the best option.

However, when inexpensive means cheap, drivers spend more for the endless repairs and maintenance issues that plague poorly built vehicles. Instead, they should consider the following cars, trucks and SUVs, which cost more than some comparable models but save their owners money over time by staying out of the shop.
Subaru’s flagship model starts at $29,010 — and you can certainly find cheaper midsize SUVs.
“The Outback is one of the more expensive crossover vehicles,” said Melanie Musson, an industry expert with AutoInsurance.org. “However, it’s worth spending more because they’re reliable. Their engines are excellent and known for durability. Their all-wheel drive and ground clearance make them ideal in winter weather and back roads, and they retain their value, so you’ll get back a lot of what you bought one for.”
And the Outback isn’t alone — Subaru is known for dependability, durability-based long-term value, and, of course, its famous standard AWD.
“Subarus have a strong reputation for versatility and reliability,” said Mark Beneke, co-owner of Westland Auto Sales in Fresno, California. “While they may not be the cheapest to work on, their engines and all-wheel-drive systems are extremely durable, so it limits the number of repairs needed. Plus, the all-wheel-drive system makes these vehicles jacks of all trades.”

If you’re in the market for a pickup, you might scratch the GMC Sierra 1500 off the list because its $40,295 is higher than the Ford Ranger, Ford F-150, Chevy Colorado, Chevy Silverado and Ram 1500.
But before you rule it out, consider that GMC asks a little more up front in exchange for long-term dependability.
“GMC costs more than its Ford and Ram competition, but it’s worth it,” Musson said. “When some trucks get a couple of years old, you’ll start dealing with annoying things like power going out to door locks, rattling parts and other small problems. GMC manufactures a step above the competition and puts as much effort into the details as it does into the engine.”

Lexus is synonymous with luxury, and the ES starts at $43,215. It’s a bargain, though, when considering how expensive luxury cars are to repair — and how infrequently the ES is in the shop.
“The Lexus ES is a smart buy in the luxury segment,” said Patryk Doornebos, owner and lead author at the automotive blog Car Triple. “It’s pricey up front but saves you money with its Toyota-derived reliability and low repair costs, not to mention its strong resale value. It’s a luxury car that’s cost-effective in the long run.”
Just as Lexus inherits the famous reliability of the Toyota brand that owns it, the Genesis luxury nameplate is owned by Hyundai, another automaker known for infrequent trips to the mechanic.
The G80 starts around $57,100 and the G90 starts at a hair under $90,000, outclassing even the Lexus ES — but higher MSRPs sometimes translate into better long-term value.
“The perception of luxury cars as expensive upfront investments is often balanced out by their reliability and lesser frequency of required repairs,” said 30-year auto industry veteran Frank De Mulder, owner of Classic Car Maintenance. “Some notable models in this category for 2023 include the Genesis G80 and Genesis G90, which have been recognized for their dependability and luxury at a relatively affordable price compared to their counterparts.”
According to Kelley Blue Book, at least seven midsize sedans have lower starting MSRPs than the Honda Accord, including the Subaru Legacy, Chevy Malibu, Hyundai Sonata, Kia K5, Nissan Altima, Toyota Camry and Volkswagen Passat.
“Even so, KBB still named the Accord its “Midsize Car Best Buy of 2023,” Beneke said. “Accords are known for their longevity and minimal repair needs, which can make them a good value proposition despite a higher upfront cost.”
The EV market has welcomed several relatively affordable models in recent years, but they still cost more, on average, than comparable ICE models. But when you go electric, you leave behind the headaches and expenses that are inherent to even the best engines.
“Pretty much any model of electric vehicle is a prime example of a car that may seem expensive up front but which can actually be economical in the long run due to their minimal repair needs,” said Aidan Rushby, CEO and co-founder of vehicle-financing platform Carmoola. “EVs have fewer moving parts, which means there’s usually less that can go wrong, leading to lower repair costs. The cost of consumables like tires, brake discs and pads will still need to be factored in, and as EVs are typically heavier than their combustion engine counterparts — you may need to replace these a little more frequently. But, on balance, and with the savings on fuel factored in, an EV can be a better option long term.”

I had no desire to buy this lens, but after using it. Now I notice the throw when compared to the RF 70-200 f/2.8L IS USM.
Redesigned for professionals who require quality and consistency in both photo and video applications, the Canon RF 70-200mm f/2.8 L IS USM Z Lens is an internally focusing, internally zooming telephoto workhorse that harnesses the power of the brand’s latest mirrorless cameras.
Its hybridized construction is optimized to produce professional results whether hand-wielded on the sideline or balanced atop a gimbal.
The lens’s internally focusing, internally zooming construction optimizes it for video shooters who intend to mount it on a gimbal. Two floating focus Nano USM motors drive the Dual Pixel CMOS autofocus and can operate independently of one another, resulting in fast and quiet autofocus that also benefits video.
The construction also suppresses focus breathing, maintaining the integrity of the image as you move through the zoom range, and a manual, lockable iris ring ensures the integrity of the exposure as you shoot.
Optically, the lens has 18 elements in 15 groups, incorporating two super ultralow dispersion elements, another ultralow dispersion element to minimize chromatic aberrations, and three additional aspherical lenses to ensure the highest edge-to-edge image quality.
Canon’s own Air Sphere and Super Spectra Coatings are applied to the front element to reduce ghosting and flare, while a fluorine coating repels oil and water to protect the lens.

69,2025-02-07,"Apple is launching its first products of the year in just a few days, per reporting from Mark Gurman. Here’s what’s coming, plus some launches that could surprise us.
Apple’s next iPhone is almost here. The iPhone SE hasn’t been updated since 2022, so it’s overdue for an upgrade. 
The new iPhone SE 4 is expected to launch next week and will pack a ton of great features.
Here’s what’s coming:
Many of these features first debuted in the iPhone 16 just a few months ago, so getting them in Apple’s budget model is especially exciting.
The current iPhone SE starts at $429, but the new SE 4 may start closer to $499. Even with a price increase, though, this will easily be the best iPhone for most people to buy.
Gurman also says there’s at least one more Apple product launching next week: Powerbeats Pro 2.
Apple and Beats have been teasing the new PowerBeats Pro 2 for a while, including recent sightings on Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy.
Gurman expects the new earbuds to be introduced “as early as Feb. 11.”
As we’ve reported previously based on an iOS 18 beta leak, the new Powerbeats Pro are expected to feature a fresh, slimmer design, and come in purple, orange, and light brown.
One of the big highlights will be the inclusion of a heart-rate sensor—a feature expected to come to AirPods Pro 3 later this year.
Gurman explicitly stated that the new iPhone SE 4 and Powerbeats Pro 2 are expected next week. But he also hinted that other product launches could be in store.
The M4 MacBook Air, for example, has been expected to arrive right around now. Gurman previously hinted that it might be the first Apple product launch of the year. 
Now, reportedly, stock of existing MacBook Air models is “dwindling” at Apple’s retail stores. This could be a sign that the M4 launch is imminent.
Similarly, Gurman says that the M2 iPad Air has been unusually low in stock at Apple Stores too. The expected M3 update could arrive sooner than we thought.
Finally, Apple’s base model iPad is getting an 11th generation update soon. It was expected that the M3 iPad Air and new A17 Pro iPad would launch around the same time.
All of these potential product launches, plus rumor of the first iOS 18.4 beta’s arrival, could make for a very fun week from Apple.
Perhaps we’ll see several days of product launches in a row, similar to what Apple did back in October with its M4 Mac introductions.
That staggered launch strategy seemed like a hit for Apple, so here’s hoping we get to see it happen again next week.
Which new Apple products are you expecting to see next week? Let us know in the comments.

Is nothing sacred?
I try to make sense of it all. I do that for my own sanity. And for you, too, in my arts and culture briefings. 
So let’s analyze the latest happenings….
A few weeks ago, Billboard warned that vinyl record sales were collapsing—and had dropped 33% in just one year. 
The next day, new ‘improved’ numbers were released. These showed vinyl sales had really grown 6% during the last year. 
But the RIAA released different numbers saying that vinyl sales were up 17%.
Then, just a few days ago, Digital Music News reported that nobody really knows what’s happened with vinyl in 2024—because the method used to track sales has changed. 
“Therefore, independent retail physical sales under the new methodology for 2024 are isolated and no trending is provided versus 2023.”
This leaves us in an uncomfortable spot. Official numbers show vinyl sales in 2024 declined versus 2023. But we’re asked not to compare them.
We’re all left with guesswork.
Let me state the obvious (that few dare say): When you see huge industries that don’t know if they’re growing or shrinking, that’s a warning sign.
So I’m sticking by my previous assessment. 
The vinyl opportunity is huge, but the major labels are killing it.
Most of their back catalog is still unavailable in vinyl—even after 15 years of the vinyl revival.
Prices are far too high. Labels could make vinyl more affordable, and turn it into a mass market product. But instead they’re fattening margins by selling albums as luxury products.
They are destroying the business. So if the market isn’t flattening (or declining) already, it will be soon. 
You don’t see advertising here on Substack—hooray!—because the business model is based on subscriptions.

But some Substack writers are much friendlier than me, and are now selling ads. More will soon do the same. 
They don’t have to share this revenue with Substack, and some of the deals are very lucrative—much higher than what blogs can charge. 
According to the Wall Street Journal:
An affiliate link or mention could cost as little as $100, a few paragraphs can bring in up to $5,000, while sponsoring a single edition of a newsletter with a subscriber base of more than 75,000 might run $20,000, authors and media buyers said.
Twenty grand to sponsor a single issue of a newsletter? 
I’m a little surprised, but maybe I shouldn’t be. Substack has become a hot thing in the last year or so, and corporations want a taste of the action.
By the way, I have no plan to sell advertising here at The Honest Broker.

72,2025-02-07,"The Chinese AI chatbot “DeepSeek” has caused a lot of controversy in recent weeks. Although DeepSeek was launched in 2023, it became popular after the introduction of the “R1” model, which performs just as well as its competitors while using fewer resources. However, the Chinese AI may soon be banned in the US – with fines and imprisonment for those who use it.
At least that’s what Republican Senator Josh Hawley wants with a new bill filled this week. According to the bill, the idea is to “prohibit United States persons from advancing artificial intelligence capabilities within the People’s Republic of China, and for other persons.”
As reported by The Independent, the proposed law stipulates that anyone violating the restrictions will face fines of up to $1 million and up to 20 years in prison. For businesses caught using Chinese AIs, the fines could reach $100 million. The senator doesn’t directly mention DeepSeek in his bill, but coincidentally it comes just a few days after the chatbot reached the top of the US App Store.
The main argument for banning Chinese AIs would be concerns about “security, privacy, and ethics.” Some also don’t like the fact that DeepSeek doesn’t answer questions on topics related to the Chinese Communist Party. Italy was the first country to ban DeepSeek for privacy reasons, while other countries may soon follow.
In the US, Texas has already banned DeepSeek from government devices. President Donald Trump recently said that the Chinese chatbot is a “wake-up call” for the national tech industry and has reportedly been investigating its impacts on national security.
After DeepSeek’s huge success, the stock price of tech companies like Nvidia plummeted. Even so, there’s no denying the chatbot’s impressive performance. Apple CEO Tim Cook recently said that “innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing” when asked about Chinese AI.

73,2025-02-07,"Bloomberg has just reported that Apple is gearing up to launch the new iPhone SE 4 very soon, perhaps as soon as next week. In the same report, Mark Gurman also revealed that iPad Air and MacBook Air stocks in Apple Stores around the world have been “dwindling,” which could be a hint at more new products coming soon.
Rumors about new iPads and Macs coming soon are nothing new. In fact, we’ve been hearing about updated iPad and MacBook Air models for a while now. Although it’s unclear that these products will arrive alongside the iPhone SE 4 in the coming days, Gurman says that the inventory of “iPad Air and MacBook Air has been dwindling at Apple retail stores.”
Usually, a product running low on stock in Apple Stores is a strong indication that a new version is coming soon. Apple is expected to put its latest M4 chip in both the new iPad Air and MacBook Air. Other than that, no major hardware or design changes are expected for this year’s models.
The company is also rumored to be working on the iPad 11, a new version of its entry-level tablet. It also won’t have any major changes apart from a faster chip, potentially the same A17 Pro as the iPad mini 7 – which will enable Apple Intelligence support on the most affordable iPad for the first time. That said, those considering buying a new iPad or MacBook should probably wait for these announcements.
Also according to the report, Apple won’t be holding an event to launch the iPhone SE 4 (and perhaps the new Macs and iPads too). In recent years, the company has chosen to publish short videos introducing new devices after unveiling them on its website, so it’s likely that the same will happen again.
Are you excited about the new products coming soon? Let us know in the comments section below.

""I literally couldn't stop."" 
That's how Jordan Holt describes the moment that he hit rock bottom with his sports gambling compulsion. The 44-year-old from Yuma, Arizona, says he started placing wagers on football and basketball back in 2007. At first, he says, it felt harmless, but then it quickly spiraled out of control.
""It was an obsession at that point. It was all I could think about. I couldn't think about anything else in my life, I couldn't focus on anything, but winning back the money I lost,"" he says. 
Holt is not alone. 
Problem gambling hotlines across the U.S. have seen a surge in calls around major sporting events, especially the Super Bowl. Millions of Americans will be tuning into the Super Bowl this weekend to watch the Philadelphia Eagles face off against the Kansas City Chiefs in New Orleans. 
According to the American Gaming Association, nearly $1.5 billion in legal bets are expected during the game, breaking last year's record of $1.2 billion. It's estimated that more than one in four American adults will bet on the game, according to the AGA.
The National Council on Problem Gambling reports that the risk of gambling addiction has increased since the Supreme Court legalized sports betting seven years ago. 
According to the council, the risk for gambling addiction in the U.S. rose by 30% between 2018 and 2021. Keith Whyte, the organization's former executive director, notes that there are several clear red flags that can help identify problem gambling.
""If you become preoccupied with your gambling. If you start to lose control over the amount and time that you spend betting. Most importantly, if it's causing harm to you. It could be performance issues at work, arguments or lost time with your family,"" says Whyte. 
Daniel Kotsias is a sports gambling counselor from Oak Park, Michigan. He says the use of smartphones and tablets has made it easier for people to get hooked.
""It's this constant dopamine on tap on iPhones, they can just tap into it whenever they want,"" says Kotsias. He says what separates a gambler from a problem gambler is a phenomenon called ""chasing your losses."" 
""Some people think that they caused that big win because of of their sports knowledge, but unfortunately because the house always wins, eventually they'll keep betting to try to win more and they will lose — and that's when chasing their losses starts to happen,"" says Kotsias. 
As for Holt, he says he repeatedly tried to quit, even going for days without placing a bet. But then he would get a text message on his phone from FanDuel, an online gambling company.
""When you gamble so much money, they will make you feel good about it and put you in their VIP room,"" says Holt. ""You have your own personal bookie and one of the perks is that they will always give you bonus bets that ultimately pull you right back in,"" says Holt.

Between 2022 and 2024, Holt lost roughly $110,000 — a loss that left him completely disconnected from his life. 
""I thought about suicide on numerous occasions. I didn't feel like I was a valuable member of society anymore. I felt like I wasn't contributing anything and I just wasn't meant to be here anymore,"" he says.
FanDuel referred NPR to the American Gaming Association, which it's a member of, for comment. Joe Maloney, the senior vice president for strategic communication, says sports betting companies are dedicated to responsible gaming practices. 
""Companies are meeting consumers where they are in the same way the digital transformation allows consumers to use apps to purchase things from groceries to using a phone to take part in legal regulated gambling,"" Maloney says. He adds that taxes from the gaming industry helps fund programs to help problem gamblers.
With sports betting reaching record levels, Whyte, from the National Council on Problem Gaming, says it's the responsibility of the government to set a ""level playing field"" with stronger gambling regulations. 
""There's too much money on the table for companies to entirely self-regulate or for the government who makes enormous tax revenue off gambling, they're not always on the side of the consumer,"" says Whyte.
The Senate Judiciary Committee took up legislation last year that would regulate sports gambling. The SAFE Bet Act, introduced by Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, would create nationwide consumer protections and standards for the mobile sports gambling industry.
""This bill is a matter of public health,"" says Blumenthal. ""It's a matter of stopping addiction, saving lives and making sure that young people particularly are protected against exploitation."" 
The legislation contains a number of provisions that would regulate sports betting. It prohibits advertising during live sporting events while banning promotions that offer bonus bets, odds boosts and other inducements. 
It would force companies to conduct affordability checks on customers, bans deposits via credit cards, and limits customers to five deposits over a 24-hour span. 
The bill would also ban companies from using artificial intelligence to track a customer's gambling habits, which are used to offer individualized promotions as well as ""micro-bets"" and other AI-powered products.
While the act has garnered bipartisan support in both the House and Senate, some critics worry that its regulatory measures could stifle innovation in a rapidly evolving market. But proponents argue the Safe Bet Act is a necessary step to bring clarity and accountability to an industry that continues to grow in both scale and complexity. 
Nearly 40 states — and the District of Columbia — now have some form of legalized gambling.
As for Jordan Holt, he's in recovery for his gambling addiction. The ""diehard Kansas City fan"" says Sunday night will be about kicking back with his family, eating sausage and cheese, barbecuing wings — and rooting for the Chiefs.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with a Gen Z employee at a Magnificent 7 company. The source's name and full employment history are known to Business Insider but are not named to protect their privacy. It's been edited for length and clarity.

        I always dreamed of working in Silicon Valley for a Big Tech company, but now that I've experienced working at one of the Magnificent 7, I don't think it's the best career path for everyone.
    

        I advise people considering breaking into Big Tech to self-reflect before deciding if this path is right for them.
    

        I wanted to impact millions through lines of code, and I've been working toward getting into a Big Tech company since day one.
    

        I got my bachelor's degree in computer science in the US and became a full-time software engineer when I joined a Big Tech company right after graduation.
    

        I had the opportunity to intern as a software developer.
    

        Mass-applying to Big Tech internships, networking on LinkedIn, researching, and freelancing to build my portfolio got me in the door. I also attended hackathons like TreeHacks, LA Hacks, and Technica and conferences like the Grace Hopper Conference and Afrotech.
    

        I started these efforts while I was still a student, taking on several odd jobs, including working as IT support, doing unpaid work for startups, and teaching assistantships for six core computer science courses in college.
    

        I also started consistently posting on LinkedIn and writing a tech blog.
    

        This helped me land a full-time Big Tech job a year later.
    

        My dream hasn't disappointed me — I love working in Big Tech. The perks are endless: gorgeous offices, free or subsidized food and drinks, high-impact work, great retirement and health insurance benefits, fitness reimbursement, intelligent coworkers, a high paycheck, and more.
    

        That doesn't mean Big Tech is right for everyone. If you fall into one of these five categories, you might not be a good fit for a Big Tech career.
    

        If you're uncomfortable in a high-pressure environment where working at breakneck speed is essential, Big Tech might not be for you.
    

        Big Tech companies hire people who are not only highly competent but also extremely motivated, often paying top-of-market salaries to attract the best talent. These companies focus on speed and constant innovation to stay ahead of the competition, so you usually need to move fast.
    

        We're encouraged to interact with other parts of the business, which fosters faster decision-making and reduces communication barriers. They also expect high-quality work immediately, even from an intern.
    

        I am OK with working quickly. I learned right away that making a concrete plan of action, setting sub-goals to stay on track, and ensuring I jump into the task immediately instead of procrastinating is helpful.
    

        The tech industry is fast-paced, which is further amplified when you work for a highly innovative Big Tech company. Candidates for this field must be comfortable adapting quickly to new tools, frameworks, and APIs.
    

        When AI tools are first introduced, many Big Tech companies will immediately encourage their employees to use them to work more efficiently. I've seen a surge in the use of AI tools in my job since the start of 2024.
    

        Rapid innovation and results are part and parcel of the tech industry. These demands can cause employees to experience serious pressure — especially those who aren't genuinely passionate about their work.
    

        You must ensure you choose the right team and enjoy your work — otherwise, you'll be stressed out. I handle stress by traveling and taking wellness days off.
    

        With best-in-class benefits that most people can only dream about, it makes sense that some people are attracted to Big Tech for free food or health and fitness benefits. This is a mistake.
    

        The perks exist to help you perform your best at work. If you join just for the sake of those, they can distract from your work's actual purpose and impact. They might also reduce the drive to improve and adapt, potentially hindering long-term career growth.
    

        Initially, I went through a period where I was distracted by the perks. It was easy for me to keep socializing when eating office free food and then could fall behind on my work. I've learned to stay focused.
    

        Engaging in work that you don't find meaningful only for the money and benefits can quickly lead to feelings of dissatisfaction and disconnection — the so-called ""golden handcuffs.""
    

        When your primary motivation is financial, you may miss out on the joy of solving problems or creating innovative solutions. My primary motivation is that I enjoy coding and love that my code is used by and helps billions of people.
    

        I see myself working in Big Tech long-term. I love the impact I can make in this industry, enjoy the benefits and pay, and can envision long-term growth.

Most people commute in and out of New York City by train, ferry, or car. But some in the upper echelons of society can afford to fly above the chaos.

        I recently took a demo flight on a Flexjet Sikorsky S-76 helicopter between Manhattan and Teterboro, New Jersey, to experience how the rich travel in a hurry. It cut travel time from what could be over an hour to just minutes
    

        Private charter companies like Flexjet, Blade, and HeliFlite connect heliports on the east and west sides of Manhattan to suburban hot spots like New Jersey, Westchester County, the Hamptons, and other affluent areas.
    

        I immediately saw how the pricey helicopter rides are well worth the convenience for these deep-pocketed people — and the helicopters come with ritzy perks like free alcohol and food and luxe VIP cabins.
    

        But I couldn't ignore the effects on residents and the need for these companies and their customers to be conscious of the noise and environmental impacts.


        A local activist group called ""Stop the Chop"" wants to eliminate non-essential helicopter rides over NYC, including for tourism and charters. The New York City Council has proposed legislation to meet this demand, including proposing a noise tax. A similar bill passed the state senate last year.
    

        Flexjet CEO Michael Silvestro told Business Insider it is aware of the disturbances to New Yorkers, adding the company is carbon neutral and works to reduce its noise footprint.
    

        ""We're always trying to be good citizens, no matter what we do, whether it's environment or noise abatement,"" he said. ""We try to follow all of our aircraft's protocols to those who live nearby.""
    

        Silvestro said Flexjet's helicopters are largely used for airport transfers to complement its private jet operation, with some on-demand and charter flying.
    

        For example, someone may fly in a Flexjet Gulfstream G650 from London to Teterboro and then use a helicopter to transfer to Manhattan. Silvestro said the transfer is included in the total charter cost and helps differentiate it from other private aviation companies.
    

        Flexjet's six-seater Sikorsky is fancy, with drawers full of drinks and snacks, including alcohol like tequila and fireball whiskey. Passengers didn't have to wear headsets.
    

        My ride took under 10 minutes, taking off just a two-minute walk from where I parked my car — and there was no security check. We departed from and arrived at a private terminal.
    

        Some travelers may be weary of helicopters, but Flexjet has a long history of safety and requires its helicopter pilots to have at least 3,000 hours of flight experience. The Sikorsky helicopters also require two pilots instead of one.
    

        Thanks to the sunny weather, my journey was quick and easy. Silvestro said it wouldn't operate helicopters in rough conditions.
    

        ""Helicopters are more weather-dependent,"" he said. ""There are a lot of times when we're flying in and out of here with our fixed-wing jets but won't fly our helicopters because the weather is below our safety standards.""
    

        Flexjet uses several noise abatement strategies when flying over cities.
    

        For example, it doesn't fly outside curfew hours to minimize nighttime disturbances and uses specific flight corridors that reduce noise near more communities.
    

Helicopter flying in New York will likely remain popular in the highly populated city as a way for the wealthy to avoid the common folks' congested ground transportation, despite the ongoing efforts to reduce traffic in the city.
    

        New York implemented an up-to-$9 congestion pricing toll in January to deter more cars from entering Manhattan's busiest areas — lessening traffic, honks, and carbon emissions — but that has only prompted more helicopter flights.
    

        Blade has since begun offering $95 flights to and from New Jersey and Long Island to commuters who want — and can afford — to skip the traffic altogether.
    

        The city has also considered electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles, or eVTOLs, as a quieter and more carbon-friendly solution. None have been certified yet.
    

        United Airlines hopes to begin flying air taxis made by California-based Archer Avition between Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey and Manhattan as soon as 2025.
    

        These would compete with Blade, for example, which is also planning to adopt electric aircraft to battle surging noise complaints.
    

        Silvestro said eVTOLs are a significant innovation in the industry, and Flexjet is considering how to incorporate them — especially since it already has experience flying helicopters that have similar operating factors.
    

        ""Things like air traffic control and landing zones that affect helicopters today will affect eVTOLs in the future,"" he said. ""We feel we have a strategic, practical window into how to operate eVTOLs when they enter the market.""

80,2025-02-07,"One of the most recognizable homes in pop culture is hitting the market -- Kris Jenner is selling her family's longtime residence ... made famous on their hit reality show.
The Hidden Hills mansion that served as the home base for ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians"" is hitting the market ... and Kris is asking $13.5 million for this piece of reality TV history.
The 6-bedroom home is 8,860 square feet and it's instantly recognizable to 'KUWTK' fans who all remember the black-and-white checkered floor in the foyer, the kitchen table where the family shared so many meals, and the backyard where the Kardashians hosted their lavish parties.
Kris and Caitlyn Jenner bought the place in 2010 -- when Caitlyn was still Bruce -- and it was an integral part of the show and their lives.
Sources close to Kris tell TMZ ... the sale is bittersweet because the home has so many memories, but Kris is happy to have someone new love the home as much as she does.
Kris doesn't live there anymore and hasn't for some time ... but lots of Kardashians and Jenners called it home over the years.
Kim Kardashian lived at the estate while her own home was being renovated, and Rob Kardashian stayed there with his daughter, Dream.
Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner were teenagers living at home when the family first moved in ... and their childhood bedrooms have custom closets and en-suite baths.
The primary suite, where Kris lived, is like a private retreat ... decked out with a fireplace, wet bar, personal gym, steam shower and a balcony overlooking the property. Oh, and it's also got the closet she filled with nothing but Birkin bags.
There's a swimming pool and a spa in the backyard ... which served as settings for tons of 'KUWTK' scenes ... plus a BBQ area. Real estate agent Tomer Fridman holds the listing.
End of an era!!!

81,2025-02-07,"Olivia Newton-John's Santa Ynez ranch is set to be a new owner's ""Xanadu"" ... the striking property has officially sold after several months on the market.
Real estate sources tell TMZ ... a buyer has decided to be hopelessly devoted to the 4-bedroom, 5-bathroom estate located in Santa Barbara County -- one of California's famed wine regions.
Whoever walked away with the deed certainly got one hell of a deal, as the property was initially listed back in May for a whopping $8.965 million ... and it just sold for $7.95M.
The abode is worth every penny, given its luxe amenities ... sitting on 12 private acres with nearly 4,500 square feet of living space, a view of the Santa Ynez River, a gourmet kitchen, a 2-bedroom guest house, a pool, a barn, an outdoor kitchen, and a game room.
It's no wonder rumors circulated back in September that former President Joe Biden had been eyeing the property, as it's certainly fit for a man of 46's status.
However, as TMZ learned at the time, JB and First Lady Jill Biden were NOT actually planning to make the ""Grease"" actress' former home their post-White House pad ... it was all just a rumor.
It'll be interesting to see who actually scooped up the property ... and what, if any, plans they may have for the estate!!!

83,2025-02-07,"Payroll growth dips a bit but job market remains solid
The Labor Department has released its first jobs report of the year, covering January 2025.
It shows that payrolls grew by 143,000 — somewhat lower than economists’ expectations of 175,000. On the other hand, payroll growth for the end of 2024 was revised up quite a bit. Over the past 3 months, payroll growth has averaged a very strong 234,000.
Payroll growth was concentrated in a handful of sectors: healthcare (44,000), retail trade (34,000), social assistance (22,000) and government (32,000). Hourly wage growth was quite strong, but averages 4.2% over the past two months — which is very consistent with its growth over 2024.
The unemployment rate dipped slightly to 4.0%, while labor force participation also grew slightly (to 62.6%). The unemployment rate has declined from 4.2% a few months ago, and the employment rate out of the population has risen from 59.8 to 60.1%, which are encouraging signs that the job market still remains quite strong.
The dip in payroll growth last month suggests that the labor market could be slowing a bit, since the job vacancy rate for December (reported earlier this week) dipped to 4.5% — it’s lowest level since the pandemic. But, given the extremely strong hiring rates at the end of 2024, it would be premature to make this claim right now based only on January data.
The Labor Department also reported that non-farm productivity rose 1.2% for the fourth quarter of 2024, and 1.6% over the past year. These numbers are somewhat lower than what we had observed in 2023 but consistent with productivity growth over the past decade. Combined with our wage growth of just over 4%, it suggests labor costs are rising at about 2.5%, which is not far above the Fed’s target rate for inflation.
One other bit of news appears in this report: The Labor Department revised down payroll growth for the past year (by about 600,000) and revised up its population growth numbers by 2.8 million. This mostly eliminates a major gap that had appeared between the BLS payroll and labor force growth numbers in 2023-24, which should move in tandem over time. Immigration accounts for much of the higher population growth, and has helped reduce inflationary pressures in the job market.
Overall, the job market seems to have cooled just a bit in January but mostly remains solid. The biggest source of uncertainty for the market outlook in 2025 remains the Trump administration, whose plans to deport large numbers of immigrants and place tariffs on our trading partners (who will retaliate against our export sectors) could disrupt economic activity and cause higher inflation. The Federal Reserve is wise to wait on further cuts in interest rates as it monitors the economy in 2025, but the current data suggest the job market remains strong and steady.

For a company to stay the course in an uncertain economy, it's crucial to understand the audience you intend to serve—keep your finger on the pulse. Then, develop a sustainable business model you can rely on no matter what marketplace commentators are predicting.
Here, 13 leaders from Forbes Business Development Council offer their solutions for building a flexible and scalable business model that adapts to future market trends and disruptions.
Diversity and scalability are the core components of an adaptable business model. For example, in the medical device sector, changes in reimbursement or regulation can impact how providers and patients access your product. Diversify your customers while consistently nurturing existing ones. Streamline business and production processes so adjustments can be made easily based on demand to keep your revenue goals in line. - Eyal Shamir, IceCure Medical
Agility is the most critical skill and trait for a business leader today. Being agile allows leaders to quickly adapt to changing market conditions and seize new opportunities. Without agility, leaders lose the ability to be flexible and scale as the market changes. - Julie Thomas, ValueSelling Associates
Think of your customer as a partner. You turn passive customers into brand advocates and creators by encouraging users to actively contribute via a paid commission or points structure. This builds scalability through user-generated content, peer-to-peer engagement and low-cost acquisition. This is a great way of keeping on the pulse of trends, as each consumer will resonate with their own ecosystem. - Angelica Kopec, She Knows Business
One way to build an adaptable model to withstand market disruption is to focus on your core differentiators and develop use cases that apply your biggest strengths to various contexts. Client needs often relate to market trends and can help you identify unique applications of your solutions. You can better tolerate disruption by tailoring what you do best to diverse use cases. - Ray Parzik, The Oncology Institute of Hope and Innovation
Develop a pod structure for sales, product, marketing and supply chain teams. This helps create agility and nimbleness to latch onto future trends and adapt quickly. - Ruchir Nath, Dell Technologies
Forbes Business Development Council is an invitation-only community for sales and biz dev executives. Do I qualify?
Some of the most practical and efficient business ideas have a way of bubbling up from the market. One effective strategy that enables businesses to keep their eyes on consumer behavior is the continuum of innovative consumer feedback loops. Consistent analysis and collection of this data helps enhance customer loyalty and drive new revenue streams. - John Drumgoole Jr., USA Mortgage
There’s no universal strategy for scaling a business indefinitely. To build a flexible and scalable model, leaders must align their goals with available resources to maintain high standards. Focusing on offering high value first ensures sustainable growth—attempting to scale without solid value can lead to diminished quality and long-term setbacks. - Anna Jankowska, RTB House
Always remain in tune with clients. Join sales meetings to hear what keeps them up at night, so you can ensure your business addresses their biggest concerns and opportunities. Invest in tech and research that empower you to better understand your business’s performance, future intent and need, the competitive landscape and markets you serve, ensuring you can quickly sense shifts and respond accordingly. - Michael Della Penna, InMarket
One approach is to adopt a modular business model. Offer adaptable products or service tiers that can change depending on the market's needs. Further, combining a modular business model and supporting those efforts with ongoing feedback and trend analysis allows a company to remain on top of how things adapt and change in a dynamic marketplace. It allows leaders to anticipate and not simply react. - Wayne Elsey, The Funds2Orgs Group
It sounds easier said than done, but business leaders must build flexibility into their plans at every stage—whether it's a quarterly plan or a five-year plan. Of course, one should always aim for growth and meeting one’s goals. But, in the case of challenges or missed opportunities, teams must come together and look at alternative routes. This allows for business continuity that is receptive to change. - Toby Carrington, Seismic
Be nimble in your approach. Nobody can predict how market trends and disruptions will occur with 100% certainty. The only way to evolve and take advantage is by being non-rigid in your stance and approach. Successful entities are the ones that adapt to the best changes. Just pick a few names out of the S&P 500 and you will notice they are the ones that transitioned the best with the times. - Mustansir Paliwala, Zomara Group
One of the most effective ways to build a flexible and scalable business model is by investing in reputation management for your brand or product. A strong reputation lays the foundation for navigating market changes and crises. When customers trust your brand, they’ll continue to talk about it, recommend it and make purchases—no matter the external circumstances. - Dima Raketa, Reputation House
Don’t just review what your customers are saying; commit to the change they are looking for, whether it’s improvements or additional services, and find a way to address it head-on. This also shows that your company is involved at a level that makes it clear why your clients choose you. You are being innovative and putting it into practice, not just on paper. - Elias Diaz, Virtudesk

Apple could introduce a foldable by 2027
Given the market and a decade of patents, it's no surprise that Apple is experimenting with foldable displays that would be used in a future iPhone Fold, iPad, or Mac. Here's what the rumor mill says is coming. Apple Vision Pro appears to be Apple's answer to customers' ever-increasing need for display real estate. However, wearable face computers may not fit every person or use case, so the next best thing may be foldables.Folding phones and tablets aren't new, as consumers have been able to buy some form of the technology for nearly a decade. Rumors and patents have circulated suggesting Apple would introduce a folding iPhone, iPad, or even MacBook at some point in the future.Sure, the perfect solution to needing more screen is having one that can virtually expand to show apps in your physical reality 360 degrees around you. The next best thing is a pocketable or portable device that can fold or unfold to meet whatever needs there are at the time.Let's break down Apple's ventures into foldables and where the rumors stand on such products.iPhone FlipThere are at least two form factors Apple is exploring for its first foldable phone, and so far, the iPhone Flip is the one most likely to be released to customers. It would be a clamshell device, codenamed ""v68,"" with a hinge along the short side, similar to flip phones that predated smartphones. The first Apple foldable could be the iPhone FlipThe idea is to have a large display that folds in half, is protected by being closed, and is able to fit easily in a pocket. Modern iPhones, especially the iPhone 16 Pro Max, are quite tall and stick out from pockets easily.The iPhone Flip would have similar specs to whatever Apple's current flagship models have at the time. The upcoming iPhone 17 Slim may be an ultra-thin precursor to Apple's foldable iPhone.However, Apple seems to be running into problems getting these devices thin enough to ensure folding them in half doesn't create a too-thick device.Samsung has a foldable flip phone, and it has two displays —  the foldable interior one and a small display on the outside. Apple could utilize a similar form factor that provides simple controls, notifications, and widgets on the outside screen.Of the potential foldables, the iPhone Flip is the one that may appeal to the most mainstream users. By using foldable display technology to shrink the portable form factor of the smartphone, it addresses the problem with too-big displays.iPad or iPhone FoldThe other option for Apple's foldable project is one that is the size of a standard smartphone, then opens to reveal a tablet display. Rather than use folding displays to shrink the portable form factor, it increases the screen real estate available in something the same size as a regular smartphone. An iPad that folds closed could be introduced laterThinness is still a priority for such devices, since the closed iPhone Fold can't be too much thicker than the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Otherwise, the device loses the ability to be easily pocketed.Apple will likely address such a device as an iPhone Fold that opens to an iPad mini form factor. A so-called ""iPad Fold"" would likely be a 13-inch iPad Pro that folds shut into a smaller iPad.Rumors suggest that Apple could release some kind of iPhone Fold by 2027. Apple was working with LG Display on a larger form factor device as early as April 2022.However, regardless of which form factor Apple chooses, it will need to overcome the issue with durability and display creases. It seems unlikely that Apple would release a product that has a visible crease in the display when in use.Apple has patents showing displays that fold around the outside of an iPhone, or even ones with stretchable displays. Of course, patents are usually no more than concepts and not always something that can be built easily.A rumor from a source that lacks a track record shared what they believed to be the exact specs for iPhone Fold on February 6, 2025. There were some discrepancies, but it mostly lined up with other rumors from accurate leakers.Foldables don't stop at iPhone and iPad form factors. Apple is also exploring using folding displays on much larger machines.MacBook FoldIt's an easy joke —  MacBooks already fold at the hinge, but that's not quite what a ""foldable"" MacBook would be. Instead, the entire inside of the device would be a display —  rumors place it at about 20 inches. Apple could ultimately release an all-screen MacBook foldableIt could fold all the way open to a massive tablet form factor or hinge half open to a dual display or half display, half touch keyboard. The idea is making the entire inner area of a MacBook configurable like an iPhone display.When folded shut, the device wouldn't take up much more space than a standard 15-inch MacBook. A smaller 18-inch model is also rumored.The opened display would be like having two iPad Pros side-by-side. Rumors place this larger foldable around 2028, which was echoed by another rumor.The biggest question about such a product is what operating system it would run. If it is a folding MacBook, then macOS is the obvious answer. However, that operating system is notoriously poor when used with touch.The foldable lineup from the smallest iPhone Flip to the mid-sized iPhone Fold, and the biggest foldable MacBook could gain a unique OS. Note that all of these names are placeholders, and Apple could just call the lineup something different entirely, like Apple Fold.When to expect an Apple foldableEven with all the rumors and patents, there's not a lot known about these devices. Rumors have placed their release some two years in the future since about 2019. Apple's foldable plans keep shifting forward and may never releaseOne rumor that has come and gone even suggested Apple gave up on foldables, but more rumors since have suggested otherwise.A January 2025 rumor suggested Apple is ready to pick a foldable display supplier soon. Which device the display is for is unknown, but Apple could choose LG Display.Most recently, rumors predict a 2027 release for Apple's first foldable, and that's been repeated. It's only a matter of time before that's punted back to 2029.The most telling step towards foldable technology is how Apple handles the expected iPhone 17 Slim. That device's design could be a preview of what the iPhone Flip may look like, sans hinge.

Macs already fold in the only way that makes sense. If apple wanted to ADD a folding iPad to tje existing lineup, why not? A slim portable 11” on the airplane that expamds to 22” in the hotel room and presentation meeting? Sounds great. Phone? I think more trouble than it’s worth. Zero desire for a foldable phone.

A MacBook with a continuation of its display in the place where the keyboard used to be? Isn't that a MacBook without one of its big advantages, being a keyboard. That's a (big) foldable iPad like AppleZulu said.A foldable iPhone? Well, that needs the same volume as a non-foldable plus some more for the folding mechanism so it's going to come down to nasty tradeoffs: a lot thicker when folded or less functions (cameras?) or less battery. Doesn't sound a great benefit to me on something that's going to be just that little bit more awkward/slower to use.In the pre-smart phone age there were flip phones and choccy bar phones. There were many more of the latter, presumably following similar arguments.

86,2025-02-07,"Billionaire Bill Ackman disclosed Friday his hedge fund made a major bet on ride hailing giant Uber, helping boost shares of the San Francisco-based company to their highest level in months as part of a whirlwind week for Uber stock.
Bill Ackman now owns more than 1% of Uber.
Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management owns 30.3 million shares in Uber, having begun accumulating that stake in early January, the billionaire posted to X late Friday morning.
Pershing is the owner of a 1.4% Uber stake worth $2.3 billion as of 1:30 p.m. EST.
Shares of Uber jumped nearly 3% following Ackman’s announcement, extending its Friday gain to 9% and vaulting the stock to its highest intraday share price since Oct. 30, 2024.
Uber stock is up 14% this week, tacking on about $20 billion in market capitalization, a massive turnaround after shares tanked 8% Wednesday after the company reported earnings, before gaining at least 8% each of the last two trading sessions.
Uber trades at a “massive discount to its intrinsic value,” making it an “extremely rare” investment opportunity for a company of its size, Ackman explained.
Uber was the top-performing major stock Friday, moving against a broader selloff linked to tariff and inflation agita. Uber’s rally easily outstripped the returns of the other 100 S&P 500 companies worth at least $100 billion, with AI-focused government contractor Palantir checking in as the next-best performer with a 4% gain.
Ackman’s assessment of Uber reflects the growing consensus that the long-time cash-burning business has actually grown to be one of the cheapest big stocks compared to its bottom line. Uber trades at 18.7 times its free cash flow last quarter, a fraction of other notable technology stocks like Tesla (397 price-to-free-cash-flow), Palantir (168) and Nvidia (62). Uber generated $6.9 billion in cash in 2024, more than double its $3.4 billion in 2023. That capped a massive turnaround from Uber’s first four years as a public company, as it burned nearly $9 billion in cash from 2019 to 2023.
Ackman is worth $9.3 billion, making him the 291st-richest person in the world, according to Forbes’ most recent estimates.
Pershing Square had $18.6 billion of assets under management as of last April, with stakes in other American companies including Google parent Alphabet and Chipotle. Ackman is among the most outspoken individuals in finance, with 1.6 million followers on Elon Musk’s social media platform. A Jewish Harvard University graduate, Ackman was one of the most instrumental voices in the pushback against Ivy League universities for their handling of anti-Israel campus protests, a saga that culminated in the resignation of Harvard President Claudine Gay early last year. Last July, Pershing Square pulled plans for a New York initial public offering to become Ackman’s equivalent of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, a move that reportedly came due to weaker-than-anticipated investor demand. Previously a supporter of Democratic causes, Ackman endorsed President Donald Trump in July, donating more than $100,000 to pro-Trump groups.

87,2025-02-07,"Take $20 off the Fitbit Inspire 3 with this deal, and grab the fitness tracker for just $80"
88,2025-02-07,"A modder named SnooOranges3876 has released a plugin for Steam Deck titles that lets players adjust graphics on the fly, improving appearance and performance, and the best part is that it’s both free and easy to use. Called LetMeReShade, this plugin allows players to adjust illumination, contrast, colors, and much more on the fly. It can be particularly beneficial to older titles, too.
The plugin is available through GitHub. It circumvents the often-complicated install processes for ReShade mods and instead lets players quickly apply those mods to games. In the example video, SnooOranges3876 is seen changing shaders in Cyberpunk 2077 and Heavy Rain, with several other titles like Alan Wake and Monster Sanctuary as potential options.
When asked what the benefit of installing the plugin is, SnooOranges3876 said, “ReShade enhances game visuals by adding post-processing effects such as improved colors, contrast, sharpening, ambient occlusion, and global illumination. It allows real-time customization through an overlay UI, enabling players to tweak settings or use community presets. While primarily used for visual upgrades, it can also include performance optimizations, such as adaptive sharpening.”
Once installed, players can access an in-game overlay where different settings can be enabled or disabled with a few clicks. Just be aware that it isn’t totally without cost; you’ll feel a performance hit with this enabled on most games. Users on the subreddit suggested finding a title that runs easily at 60 frames per second on high settings and then locking it to 40fps after enabling the plugin.
The Steam Deck continues to grow in popularity despite competitive hardware like the ROG Ally entering the market, and much of that growth is due to community support with unofficial mods like this one. LetMeReShade isn’t available on the official Deck Loader plugin list, but you can still get your hands on it and install it manually through Github.
So, it's Christmas Day. You've finished opening all your presents. Now, you've got a whole bunch of gift cards, and maybe even some extra cash thanks to a kind uncle who has no idea what to buy you every year. How should you spend it? As Digital Trends' senior gaming editor, allow me to be a devil on your shoulder and goad you into buying some PC games.
The Steam Winter Sale is happening now through January 2, 2025. As always, it brings some major discounts on some of the year's best games (and plenty more beyond that). If you've been waiting to buy some games this year assuming they'd get a discount down the line, this is your moment. To help you sort through your options, I've pulled together some of the best deals in this year's sales. I'm focusing on games that came out in 2024 to help fill out your backlog, but note that there's plenty more deals to explore this year.
Star Wars: Squadrons is the most underrated Star Wars video game to be released since Disney acquired Lucasfilm, and you can pick it up during this Steam sale for just $2. It's a great time to pick it up, too.
December is a month I have always associated with Star Wars. I have fond memories of getting games like 2005's Star Wars: Battlefront II or Star Wars: The Force Unleashed on Christmas as a kid, and Disney has typically released recent Star Wars films in theaters or aired TV shows on Disney+ during this month. Right now, Star Wars: Skeleton Crew is airing on Disney+, and its whimsical The Goonies-like vibe resonates with me more than any Star Wars show has since season 1 of The Mandalorian.
Since its launch, I'm a bit of a Steam Deck apologist. It doesn't need the advocacy, as the Steam Deck is easily the best handheld gaming PC you can buy, but even in the face of competition from the ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and MSI Claw, I still use my Steam Deck for gaming on the go. A couple of apps have been slowly changing that story, however.
I like playing on my Steam Deck OLED due to the convenience. SteamOS isn't perfect, no, but it allows me to pick up and play my games quickly, which I value more than the higher performance available on Windows handhelds. A couple of key tweaks to the Windows experience can unlock that pick-up-and-play experience, and ever since configuring the ROG Ally X properly, I've been gravitating toward it more and more for my handheld gaming.

        Janelle Gale, the company's vice president of human resources, told staffers in a post on Meta's internal Workplace forum about ""how the process will work and what to expect ahead of Monday,"" according to a copy of the memo obtained by Business Insider.
    

        Gale said affected workers would be notified through an email to their work and personal email addresses and lose access to company systems within an hour of being informed. They will receive information about their severance package in the same email, she added.
    

        ""For teams that have a teammate or manager exit on Monday, I understand this might be a difficult day, and there could be some disruption and short-term impacts on your day to day work,"" Gale wrote.
    

        ""Managers might not yet have all the answers to your questions, but will be partnering with their leaders and working through these changes with you to provide additional clarity,"" she added.
    

        The memo said that employees in France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands were exempt from the cuts ""due to local regulations"" and that the company would instead follow ""local performance management processes.""
    

        Gale also detailed the times at which affected employees in different countries would be notified. She said, though, that some international employees in more than a dozen countries would be notified later than their US colleagues, between Tuesday and February 18.
    

        Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees in an internal memo in January that he ""decided to raise the bar on performance management"" and act quickly to ""move out low-performers."" He said at the time that affected employees in the US would be notified on Monday.
    

        Gale's memo also said that terminated employees could apply for a role after leaving Meta once the nonworking period and final employment date had passed. She added that ""past performance will be considered"" in the decision.
    

        All the affected employees will still receive their vesting stock due February 15, the memo said, along with a bonus if they're eligible and any due dividend equivalents.
    

        Meta didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
    

        Here's the full memo from Gale:

91,2025-02-07,"On Feb. 7, New York Governor Kathy Hochul issued an order to temporarily close live bird markets after cases of avian influenza, or bird flu, were detected in seven markets in Queens, Brooklyn, and the Bronx in the past week. The closures apply to all bird markets, including those that didn't report any cases, in New York City, Westchester, Suffolk, and Nassau counties.
The order requires market owners to sell or otherwise remove all live birds and conduct a thorough cleaning and disinfection of their facilities—even if bird flu wasn't detected there. All markets must remain closed for five days after the cleaning to confirm they are free of the H5N1 bird flu virus so that the virus won't spread again when live animals are reintroduced.
Here's what to know about the decision and what it means for bird flu to be detected in poultry.
“Getting ahead of any biological threat—in this case, amongst birds—is good to do,” says Dr. Raj Panjabi, senior partner at Flagship Pioneering and former leader of the National Security Council’s pandemic office. Panjabi coordinated the White House’s response to bird flu in 2022. “I like that New York is being proactive here, and leveraging the state agriculture commissioner and the health commissioner at the state as well as city level, to coordinate.”
Jarra Jagne, professor of practice in the department of public and ecosystem health at Cornell Veterinary School, says some of the infected birds had died and were reported by market operators, while some were detected by the state's routine surveillance for H5N1. Jagne's lab is funded by New York State Animal Health Diagnostics Lab, and her team performs testing for the state for a number of infectious diseases in chickens and other species. Because of the extensive testing network, she says, the cases ""were picked up pretty early.""
New York State health commissioner Dr. James McDonald says once the positive tests were confirmed, the state health and agriculture departments decided to close all markets in several counties, including those that had not reported any infections. ""When you get a result from surveillance, now you have new information,"" he says. ""That's when you need to take the prudent next step, and this is the prudent next step. We know if we act now, we have a better chance of not seeing the virus spread to others.""
There are many ways birds could be infected. Some could have picked up the infection from the farms where they originated; the virus is currently prevalent in wild birds, and as they leave feces in the environment, birds on farms or commercial operations could become exposed and infected. Jagne says that in January, her lab found 23 cases of H5N1 in wild birds from 12 counties in New York. In markets in particular, people might also be spreading the virus to the chickens. ""People walking into markets could have been on the beach and picked up some feces on their shoes from Canada geese,"" says Jagne. ""Farmers could also be bringing it in from farms after walking into chicken houses with infected feces. It's really hard to pinpoint the source of the virus.""
""I think it’s worth considering,” says Panjabi. During his tenure in the White House, when H5 bird flu viruses began causing outbreaks, he says “it was really challenging, because in wild bird populations, there are certain times of year when they will be more active in migration and also have more active virus. Detection of the virus in wild birds gets outbreaks spiraling.”
Read More: What to Know About the H5N9 Bird Flu
Panjabi says New York’s actions will be closely watched by public health and agriculture experts. “What we’ve generally seen is that while there is short-term pain, there is less spread over the long term,” he says. While commercial poultry farms have a number of policies in place now to recognize and intervene if animals get sick, live bird markets are less regulated and have fewer protection measures in place. Typically, “a seller of birds may not recognize the symptoms and signs of infection, no one is wearing personal protective equipment, and they are not cleaning and sanitizing,” he says. “We know the risk [of disease in people] increases if there is more human interaction with poultry, especially in less-controlled environments.”
Outbreaks among commercial poultry farms have jumped in the last two months. The U.S. Department of Agriculture shows that 85 flocks and nearly 24 million birds were affected by H5N1 by the end of January.
Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, says the increasing number of outbreaks may be due to higher amounts of H5N1 in the environment. Infected wild birds leave behind feces, which comes in contact with commercial flocks. “This virus is common in the environment, and it’s blowing around. That’s different from anything we’ve seen before,” he says.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, eating properly cooked chicken and eggs is safe, but “eating undercooked or uncooked poultry, eggs or consuming unpasteurized milk from infected dairy cows could also be an exposure risk for infection with avian influenza A viruses.”
“The current risk to New Yorkers of bird flu (H5N1) remains low,"" said New York City health department acting commissioner Michelle Morse in a statement. ""Avian influenza viruses only present a wider risk if the virus develops the ability to transmit between people—which we have not seen.""
To protect themselves from the virus, McDonald says people should not drink raw milk; pasteurization can kill the virus. And when it comes to chickens, he says that ""no birds from impacted establishments are sold or allowed to enter the food supply."" But if an infected chicken slips in undetected, cooking chicken and eggs properly can neutralize the virus and make the products safe to eat.

US stock futures inched lower after Amazon (AMZN) joined Google (GOOG) and other AI-focused Big Tech companies with disappointing projections for the next year.
Futures attached to the major indexes all were slightly lower on open. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) hovered around the flatline, while S&P 500 (ES=F) and Nasdaq (NQ=F) futures inched 0.1% lower.
Earnings season has been dominated by AI discussions after DeepSeek shook the industry. Focus on sky-high costs for AI development at Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) has led to investor reticence to continue footing the bill without seeing tangible results.
Amazon's earnings provided the latest entry in that narrative, as the tech behemoth disappointed with its outlook. Shares dropped around 4% after the bell Thursday, following on similar post-earnings movements from Google and AMD (AMD) earlier this week.
While landmark companies suffered losses, AI has allowed some to crack open the market, with Palantir's (PLTR) military analytics business popping 10% Thursday, adding to a big rally this week. Pinterest (PINS) also harnessed AI to boost ad sales, posting a 19% leap in extended trading.
A week of unpredictable tariff news from President Donald Trump has kept traders on their toes while pushing some onto stable assets. With stocks getting battered, safe-haven gold (GC=F) has seen all-time highs, pulling back after the close Thursday.
Meanwhile, Trump has set his eyes on hedge funds by announcing his intent to close a loophole that allows fund managers to pay capital gains tax instead of income tax on money received through investment businesses.
Come Friday morning, all eyes will turn to the January jobs report to provide a pulse check on the health of the US economy and labor market. Economists expect hiring to have slowed last month but remain robust.
Chinese tech stock trading in Hong Kong was poised to enter a technical bull market after DeepSeek’s artificial intelligence model ignited interest in China’s internet firms. The Hang Seng Tech Index hit gains of 2.5%, taking its year to date rise up to 20%

93,2025-02-07,"Andrew ""Boz"" Bosworth claims he'd predicted DeepSeek months before it unfolded.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

Chinese AI startup DeepSeek hit the tech world by storm after achieving the seemingly impossible. At a fraction of the development cost, its R1 V3-powered model surpassed OpenAI's proprietary o1 reasoning model across several benchmarks, including coding, math, and science.
The model's emergence caused a drastic shift in market stocks. NVIDIA shed up to $600 billion in market valuation, debatably the largest drop in history to take place in a single day. While DeepSeek's success seemingly remains a mystery, Meta Chief Technology Officer (CTO) Andrew Bosworth claims he'd predicted the whole thing six months ago before it unfolded (via Business Insider).
While responding to a question about DeepSeek's emergence from one of his Instagram followers, Bosworth claimed it was ""a funny one to watch unfold."" Further indicating:
""I actually had an email of me predicting it, that it would come from somewhere, didn't know it'd be DeepSeek, like six months ago. So I think for those of us in the space, it was not as surprising as those out of it.""
Meta reportedly attempted to pick up the slack in the AI race using crude methods, including training its AI models with copyrighted content, further covering its tracks to avoid copyright infringement issues.
We were tracking DeepSeek when it launched like a month before it then became this major news item. I think it is both a big deal and also not as big as it's made out to be. DeepSeek's launch is a big deal because it's a great open-source innovation. They've done some really truly great and novel work in memory architectures for model building. They've certainly advanced the state of the art for reasoning models. They've probably done a lot of distilling against existing models.
DeepSeek is a ""great thing, but it's not a world-changing thing,"" concluded Bosworth.
Admittedly, DeepSeek's emergence has raised some eyebrows in the industry. An email shared by Microsoft CFO Amy Hood urged employees to remain focused on company goals amid recent AI developments in the industry, potentially including OpenAI's $500 billion Stargate commitment to develop sophisticated infrastructure for AI advances. However, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella touted DeepSeek as super impressive and that it's good for business.

94,2025-02-07,"The first jobs report since President Donald Trump’s inauguration came out Friday morning, falling short of headline expectations in the weakest start to a year for overall job growth since before the COVID-19 pandemic, though other data points revealed a resilient labor market.
Friday is the first jobs report since Trump's inauguration. 
January’s employment update at 8:30 a.m. EST revealed the U.S. economy added 143,000 non-farm payrolls from December to January, on a seasonally adjusted basis.
Economists expected 170,000 new jobs, according to consensus economist forecasts compiled by FactSet.
But the unemployment rate was 4% last month, beating estimates of 4.1%, where it stood in December.
And average hourly wages increased 4.1% year-over-year to a new record of $35.87, compared to forecasts calling for average hourly wages to increase by 3.8% to pay of $35.80.
The government also reported 100,000 additional jobs added in November and December than previously shared.
Friday’s report provided evidence of slowing expansion. The 143,000 jobs added would be the weakest January total since 2016. January is the ninth consecutive month of at least 4% unemployment, after the U.S. spent all of Feb. 2022 to April 2024 below that mark.
“Aside from a slightly disappointing headline payrolls number, the broader picture is still one of labor market resilience and sustained wage pressures,” Seema Shah, Principal Asset Management’s chief global strategist, wrote in emailed comments.
How investors will react to the report. It would likely take an “outlier print” of less than 100,000 or more than 250,000 January jobs added to significantly move markets, predicted Bank of America economists led by Aditya Bhave. Stock futures were flat after Friday’s release.
Weather often impacts nonfarm payrolls, and Friday’s wasn’t an exception: The California wildfires and extreme winter weather each knocked off about 20,000 jobs added than typical in January, according to Goldman Sachs.
The December jobs update released Jan. 10 caused a significant selloff, as the S&P 500 declined 1.5% to a two-month low and yields for the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury rose to their highest level since 2023 (higher bond yields signal less valuable bonds). That came as Wall Street interpreted the better-than-expected December report as a death knell for further interest rate cuts in the near term, and the Fed signaled later that month it had in fact put its rate-cutting plans on the back burner. In short, Wall Street is hoping for lower rates to boost stock market valuations as corporate profit margins would benefit from cheaper borrowing costs, while the Fed is less likely to enact those cuts if the economy and labor market is not in need of a boost.

95,2025-02-07,"Honor, Google, Xiaomi, and Vivo all launched new folding phones last year that were designed to compete with Samsung and the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Yet, the challenge was not just matching Samsung, but also beating a foldable launched the previous year.
Launching in the US, the OnePlus Open set a standard for the industry that ensured it still ranked highly as one of the best folding phones a year later.
To meet this challenge, Honor launched the Magic V3 as the slimmest folding phone ever, and Google launched the revamped Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Both phones delivered an experience that could challenge the best on the market, but conspicuous in its absence was OnePlus, and sister company Oppo.
Rather than launch a new folding phone before it was ready, Oppo chose to wait. The company has been steadily teasing various features on its new folding phone, and as it turns out, the wait was likely worth it. I’m ridiculously excited about the Oppo Find N5, and the best thing is that it will probably also launch as the OnePlus Open 2 in the US and some global markets.
Here’s why I’m so excited and what it means for other folding phones on the market.
Oppo CEO Pete Lau — who also co-founded OnePlus — has been steadily teasing the Find N5 on social media, and every teaser is seemingly worth shouting about. The first that captured my attention was related to the thickness, with Oppo billing the Find N5 as the thinnest folding phone ever made.
🤏 pic.twitter.com/DHz7Uma2tZ
&mdash; Pete Lau (@PeteLau) January 23, 2025
Last year saw the launch of the Honor Magic V3, which holds the current title for the thinnest folding phone. Measuring just 4.3mm at its thinnest point when unfolded, it’s a joy to use and is far more comfortable in the hand than rivals like the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold which measure 5.6mm and 5.1mm respectively.
It may not seem like much, but these are big differences when you’re using the phone daily. Crucially, it also means that it’s much thinner when folded. I use the front screen on my folding phone at least 40% of the time, and it translates to a more ergonomic feel. The Magic V3 is 9.3mm thin when folded, whereas the Z Fold 6 is 12.1mm and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is 10.5mm.
The world&#39;s thinnest foldable is coming 🤏 #OPPOFindN5 pic.twitter.com/WhTybLclKm
&mdash; Pete Lau (@PeteLau) January 14, 2025
How does the Oppo Find N5 compare? We don’t know for sure, but Oppo teased it against a photo of the iPad Pro M4, which measures 5.1mm, and the iPhone 16 Pro, which measures 8.3mm. Given the Magic V3 is considerably thinner than both of these when unfolded, I’d expect that the Find N5 will come in around 4.2mm thick or even thinner. This would be impressive on its own, but there is more that looks set to help the Find N5 set a new standard for the competition to beat.
Durability has always been a concern for potential folding phone customers, thanks to the larger second display and a hinge. However, durability has vastly improved since the first Galaxy Fold and most folding phones now offer similar levels of durability to their non-folding counterparts.
That said, there’s always room for improvement and the Find N5 looks to set a new standard. When I saw the teaser about the Find N5 being thin, I was fairly excited but also somewhat tempered in my expectations. However, the latest teaser from Pete Lau has me even more excited because it’s shaping up to be more durable than any other folding phone.
IPX6 ✅ IPX8 ✅ IPX9 ✅
Immensely durable, rain or shine. #OPPOFindN5 pic.twitter.com/Yg0G3Qm8Z0
&mdash; Pete Lau (@PeteLau) February 7, 2025
Let’s consider the Honor Magic V3: it’s supremely thin but still retains some water resistance thanks to an IPX8 rating, but lacks dust resistance. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 takes this a step further with an IP48 rating offering strong water resistance and limited dust resistance, while the Pixel 9 Pro Fold offers the same IP68 rating that we’ve come to expect from non-folding phones.
The Oppo Find N5, aka the Open 2? It’ll feature an IPX9 rating, meaning it offers the same resistance not only to water but also to high-pressure jets. The other phones that feature a similar rating? The Oppo Find X8 Pro and the OnePlus 13, the latter of which works fine after being thrown in a hot dishwasher. It’s unclear whether there’ll also be dust resistance, but this will set a standard for water resistance in folding phones.
Beyond durability and thickness, the Find N5 has a few other rumored features that have me extremely excited. There’s likely to be a 6.85-inch LTPO display with 2K resolution and dynamic refresh rate. It will also be powered by a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and will probably feature 16GB of RAM like the OnePlus 13, although the latter specification is an educated guess on my part.
Powering this entire package is likely to be a 6,000mAh battery that will almost certainly use Silicon Carbon technology like its non-folding siblings. Also onboard is 80W wired charging, although there’s no confirmation or teaser around wireless charging.
No crease detected 🔍 Well, not on the #OPPOFindN5 😉 pic.twitter.com/bIwi1vO6sr
&mdash; Pete Lau (@PeteLau) February 6, 2025
One key issue with all folding phones is that most phone makers choose an inferior camera to non-folding equivalent phones. The Find N5 could solve this and set a standard thanks to the rumored triple Hasselblad camera featuring a periscope telephoto lens; if the OnePlus 13 is any indication, this could be a fantastic camera.
The Oppo Find N5 is going to pose a fierce challenge to every flagship folding phone on the market, but it won’t launch in the US or many other international markets. Instead, it’s likely to be rebranded to be the OnePlus Open 2, like the Find N3 became the OnePlus Open.
In the US, this means the Galaxy Z Fold 7 — which will hopefully take some lessons from the Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition — and the next Pixel Fold will have some fierce competition. Compared to the current generation of folding phones, it will likely have better battery life, a better camera, faster charging, and better durability. If it follows the model of the Open, it’ll also be slightly cheaper than the competition.
I’m ridiculously excited about the Oppo Find N5 because it looks set to bridge the feature gap between the best folding phones and the best phones overall. It also means that buying a folding phone will require a far smaller compromise on the features you want, and this should spur even bigger competition amongst all folding phones. It should also set a standard for the upcoming folding iPhone. Roll on the launch in just a few weeks!
Google and Samsung phones will be receiving Qi2 wireless charging, the answer to Apple's MagSafe wireless charging, this year.
The Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) said in a press release ahead of CES 2025 on Monday that the ""acceleration"" of native Qi2 wireless charging support will be rolling out to more Android phones throughout the year, including the Samsung Galaxy and Google's Pixel line of phones. Both flagship companies confirmed their intentions to program Qi2 into their respective devices.
We’ve had companies try making small phones in the past, but they couldn’t stand the test of time. Apple tried the small iPhones with the iPhone 12 mini and the iPhone 13 mini, but like most small phones, they were plagued by bad battery life and saw underwhelming sales -- despite the much-beloved pocketable size.
But 2024 redefined what ""small"" means in flagship phones. This was a year when compact devices finally stopped playing second fiddle to their larger siblings, but there's still one missing piece that needs to be addressed.
True small Pro flagships are here
In 2024, OnePlus focused on revamping its user interface and elevating its headliner candy bar phone to the level of a true flagship. Consequently, its second folding phone had to be pushed back, and we didn't see an upgrade to the OnePlus Open, which launched in 2023. However, with leaks about the OnePlus Open 2 now starting to drip in, it looks like the launch may not be too far off.
Today, we get our first look at what is expected to be the OnePlus Open 2, courtesy of SmartPrix, which claims to have compiled a list of potential specifications based on insights from leakers Chunvn and Yogesh Brar.

96,2025-02-07,"SpaceX and its subsidiary Starlink have received over $3.3B in federal dollars.
House Judiciary Democrats sent a terse letter Friday to newly minted Attorney General Pam Bondi, expressing concerns that Elon Musk's role at DOGE creates ""conflicts of interest"" due to what they said are his ""sprawling financial interests"" in federal contracts and subsidies.
Democrats contend that Musk's companies' routine engagement with federal agencies on defense contracts, telecommunications regulations, and energy policy is complicated by his participation in governmental matters impacting those sectors -- which risks violating the law because his financial interests could be directly implicated.
""Mr. Musk's position as an SGE demands heightened scrutiny,"" the lawmakers write in their letter to Bondi that was first obtained by ABC News. ""The law's criminal and civil enforcement mechanisms, which fall solely under the DOJ's authority, must be rigorously applied to prevent actual or perceived conflicts of interest.""
The group asserts that 18 U.S.C. § 208 ""explicitly prohibits"" federal employees, including Special Government Employees like Musk, from ""participating personally and substantially in a particular Government matter that will affect his own financial interests, as well as the financial interests of certain individuals with whom he has ties outside the Government.""
The letter was also sent to David Huitema the director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics.
The AG's office and Huitema didn't immediately comment about the request.
Democrats also believe Musk is subject to ""strict disclosure standards"" established by the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge, or STOCK Act, which requires Musk to publicly disclose financial interests that could create conflicts with his federal role atop DOGE.
SpaceX and its subsidiary Starlink, companies that Musk owns, have received approximately $1.7 billion from NASA, $1.3 billion from the Air Force, and $199.2 million from the Defense Information Systems Agency --- a massive total over $3.3 billion in just the past 12 months, according to USASpending.gov.
Democrats reject that the White House believes it's up to Musk to self-determine whether there is a conflict of interest. President Trump has repeatedly said that if there was a conflict, Musk would not work on areas of concern.
""If there's a conflict then we won't let him get near it,"" Trump said Monday. ""He would know not to do it, so we haven't had that yet. But if there was a conflict, we wouldn't let him work in that area.""
In their letter, Democrats urged DOJ and OGE ""to promptly investigate"" whether Musk's actions or engagements as an SGE have violated law and to ""take appropriate enforcement action if warranted.""
""The American people deserve assurances that no individual, regardless of stature, is permitted to influence policy for personal gain,"" the letter states. ""Failure to enforce this statute risks eroding confidence in the impartiality of federal decision-making.""

Today, in the Calculated Risk Real Estate Newsletter: 1st Look at Local Housing Markets in January
A brief excerpt: NOTE: The tables for active listings, new listings and closed sales all include a comparison to January 2019 for each local market (some 2019 data is not available).

This is the first look at several early reporting local markets in January. I’m tracking over 40 local housing markets in the US. Some of the 40 markets are states, and some are metropolitan areas. I’ll update these tables throughout the month as additional data is released.

Closed sales in January were mostly for contracts signed in November and December when 30-year mortgage rates averaged 6.81% and 6.72%, respectively (Freddie Mac PMMS). This was an increase from the average rate for homes that closed in November, but down from the average rate of 7.1% in November and December 2023.
...
In January, sales in these markets were up 6.4% YoY. Last month, in December, these same markets were up 17.1% year-over-year Not Seasonally Adjusted (NSA).

Note that most of these early reporting markets have shown stronger year-over-year sales than most other markets for the last several months.

Important: There were the same number of working days in January 2025 (21) as compared to January 2024 (21). So, the year-over-year change in the headline SA data will be similar to the NSA data (there are other seasonal factors).
...
This was just several early reporting markets. Many more local markets to come! There is much more in the article.

98,2025-02-07,"Apartment living is great. You have neighbors above, below, and on either side of you at all times! What could possibly go wrong? Sure, you might get noise complaints from folks who go to sleep at 2 P.M. and wake up at 10 P.M., but that's what the housing market calls for nowadays, baby!
I live in a garden-level apartment, and a piece of me withers away with every 20-minute spurt of stomps and rattles on my ceiling… but I'll never do anything about it. That's just the way life goes, and it could always be worse! However, you can always carve out time for some revenge if your neighbors start micromanaging everything you do, especially when they start complaining about completely normal noise levels at appropriate times of the day. 
The tenant in this story enacts revenge on his downstairs neighbor when they report a one-time noise level issue to their apartment complex company, and the tenant receives a ""Disturbance of Peace"" letter in the mail. The neighbor lied about the tenant to the company, claiming they were using their laundry machine at all hours of the night. So, now the neighbor gets a 6 A.M. laundry wake-up call every Sunday!

The tenant made a bit of an oopsie by painting until 2 A.M.
However, as they write, they thought it was water under the bridge after that one instance. What the tenant doesn't know yet is that the neighbors will strike up a vendetta against them and continue to micromanage everything sound they make in their apartment. People drop things; folks trip over furniture—noise is inevitable when you're a human and living in close quarters with others. But what happened to talking it out?!
