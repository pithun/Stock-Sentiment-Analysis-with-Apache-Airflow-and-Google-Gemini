FAIRFIELD, Calif. — On a crisp winter morning last month, Sgt. Erin McAtee watched as members of his team with the California Department of Cannabis Control executed a search warrant at a home in Fairfield, halfway between Sacramento and San Francisco.
They broke open the door of what looked on the outside like any other upscale suburban house on this street. Inside, the home had been gutted, transformed into a smelly mess of marijuana plants, grow lights, chemicals and pesticides.
""You can see the mold down on the tarp down there,"" McAtee said. ""Yup, that's mold."" His team also identified chemicals and pesticides not approved in the U.S. for use with consumer products like legal cannabis.

A dozen years after states first started legalizing recreational marijuana, this is the complicated world of American cannabis. 
On the one hand, weed is now as normal to many consumers as a glass of wine or a bottle of beer. A growing number of companies offer government tested, well-regulated products. But a huge amount of the cannabis being sold in the U.S. still comes from bootleg operations. California officials acknowledge illegal sales still far outpace transactions through licensed shops and vendors.
According to McAtee, it's often difficult even for experienced agents to tell weed sourced through regulated channels from the criminal stuff.
""Our undercovers will buy cannabis from people who are outwardly pretending to be legit,"" he told NPR. ""They'll tell you they have a license and that everything they're doing is legit.""
If it's hard for experienced cops to distinguish regulated weed from black market products, it can be nearly impossible for average consumers. Advocates of marijuana legalization say it's disturbing that unregulated weed plays such a big role.
""We're talking about a market that lacks transparency and accountability,"" said Paul Armentano, head of NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. He said any time a consumer product is being sold without proper regulation, it's risky.
""Whether I was getting cannabis or alcohol or my broccoli from an entirely unregulated market, I'd be concerned about any number of issues,"" Armentano said.

Advocates of cannabis decriminalization hoped legal weed companies would quickly move past this problem, eclipsing criminal growers and processors.
So far, the opposite has happened. Vanda Felbab-Brown, who studies criminal drug markets for the Brookings Institution, said regulated cannabis producers often compete with a growing network of criminal gangs often rooted in mainland China.
""They're spreading from the West Coast all the way up to Maine,"" she said.
According to Felbab-Brown, Chinese criminal organizations are drawn to the marijuana business because it's a relatively low risk to gain a foothold in communities. There's relatively little law enforcement pressure, unlike with harder drugs such as fentanyl and methamphetamines.
""These illegal cannabis cultivation plantations are used by the Chinese criminal groups for laundering money, but there is also increasingly an intertwining with human smuggling of Chinese people into the U.S. that go through some of those networks. They wind up in fact being enslaved at the plantations,"" she said.
NPR emailed Chinese officials to ask about the role of China-based organized crime in the U.S. cannabis industry but haven't heard back. In the past, Beijing has suggested the U.S. is pointing fingers at China to divert attention from America's drug and crime problems.

Experts say criminal cannabis sellers wind up outcompeting licensed vendors. They don't pay taxes or costly fees, which means their prices are often lower. They can also sell their product anywhere in the country, ignoring federal laws that prevent legal companies from shipping cannabis across state lines.
Black market weed then often winds up on store shelves, packaged in ways that can make it indistinguishable from legal regulated cannabis.
""There's going to be mold and these banned pesticide and herbicides that are getting into the illegal product so that's a grave concern,"" said Bill Jones, head of enforcement for California's Department of Cannabis Control. ""I'm not sure all consumers are aware of that.""
With cannabis markets still difficult to navigate, experts interviewed by NPR said the most reliable way to find regulated cannabis is in licensed shops in states and communities where they're allowed to operate. This often means paying a higher price, but the tradeoff in quality can be significant.

                A customer browses products for sale at the Green Goddess Collective legal cannabis dispensary in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles, California.  State officials and many cannabis experts hope licensed shops will eventually displace the booming black market industry.

Many states where recreational cannabis is legal, including California and New Jersey and New York now have online advice to help people locate and buy legal marijuana. Double-check your brick-and-mortar shop to make sure it's licensed and reputable.
Even when working through a reliable seller, cannabis experts said it's a good idea to ask questions about sourcing and potency.
Everyone interviewed by NPR for this project said they expect it to get easier over time for people who choose to buy and use legal marijuana. Most pointed to the fact that America has gone through this kind of transition before with another popular consumer product: alcohol.
Alcohol prohibition was repealed in December 1933, but many states kept liquor bans on the books into the 1950s, creating the same kind of patchwork we now see with marijuana laws. Liquor bootleggers and smugglers continued to operate for years.
""When you move from prohibition to legalization, it takes time,"" said Beau Kilmer an expert on marijuana markets and co-director of the Rand Drug Policy Research Center.

According to Kilmer, many states have mismanaged this transition, focusing too much on regulating legal weed companies without helping them compete with criminal organizations.
""After [states] pass legalization, they'll spend a couple of years coming up with the licensing regime and figuring out what the regulations are going to be and issuing licenses, but there hasn't been a lot of focus on what to do about the illegal market. And in a lot of places, enforcement just hasn't been a priority.""
This is changing in some places. In part to help legal operators compete, New York City has been cracking down on unlicensed marijuana retail stores. California officials say they seized nearly $200 million worth of illegally grown cannabis last year.
Despite these efforts, black market weed is expected to remain ""pervasive"" for years to come, according to state officials and drug policy experts.
In Fairfield, Sgt. McAtee watched as a truck backed up to another illegal grow house, preparing to haul away a big crop of seized cannabis. He said this crop might have wound up on shelves anywhere in the U.S.
""A lot of the places we hit, they're shipping their cannabis out of state, where they can make ten-fold [the profit] you'd make in California,"" he said.

Mark Zuckerberg is now $40 billion richer this year after Meta stock continued its record winning streak on Tuesday, closing higher for the 12th consecutive session.

        Shares in the Facebook and Instagram owner have risen more than 17% this year on investor enthusiasm for its AI ambitions. Meta has added $235 billion to its value in the 12 sessions, valuing the company at almost $1.8 trillion.
    

        Zuckerberg is now worth $248 billion — just $12 billion behind Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who has added $21 billion to his net worth this year, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
    

        Both are behind Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who's worth $424 billion, but ahead of Oracle's Larry Ellison and LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault — worth $194 billion and $191 billion respectively.
    

        The Meta CEO took second place for the first time in October 2024 when he was worth just $206 billion. Since then Tesla stock has surged, helping Musk widen the gap between his nearest rival.
    

        Technology fortunes are volatile, so there is no guarantee Musk will always be on top of the rich list.
    

        After falling premarket, Meta was 1.6% higher on Wednesday at about $715.

Huawei may have teased good news for consumers who've been eyeing the world's first tri-fold.
Recently, Huawei posted an ""innovative product launch"" teaser on X, which leaves speculation to wonder if its the company's tri-fold (via Android Authority). The Chinese OEM said, ""Be part of the extraordinary as we unveil the ultimate."" The final part ""the ultimate,"" seemingly refers to the Mate XT, also known as the Mate XT Ultimate Design.
Additionally, the post features a teaser image that looks like the Z-Shape we often see the Mate XT in for promotional photos.
The brief teaser ends by saying the full reveal will occur on February 18 in Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia.
Be part of the extraordinary as we unveil the ultimate. Join us at #HuaweiLaunch on 18 February 2025, Kuala Lumpur. #UnfoldtheClassic pic.twitter.com/O1RbUrBg9PFebruary 5, 2025
It's worth noting that nothing is confirmed by Huawei at this point. Aside from users speculating it could be the Mate XT in its X thread, the company has only responded with ""Stay tuned!""
As a reminder, Huawei launched the world's first tri-fold — to Samsung's surprise — in September 2024. When fully unfolded, the device features an immersive, tablet-like 10.2-inch display. The interesting thing about this phone is that users can use it in different ""modes"" or ""states."" Using a singular screen will grant you a more slab phone-style 6.4-inch OLED display while unfolding an additional screen provides a 7.9-inch experience.
At its maximum, the Mate XT is said to utilize the company's ""golden ratio"" of 16:11 in 3K resolution.

Huawei also highlighted its newly developed hinge for the Mate XT, which can accommodate internal and external bending. This was done to aid its durability with continuous opening and closing in a user's daily life.
The circular camera array offers three lenses: a 50MP primary lens, a 12MP ultrawide-angle lens, and a 12MP periscope lens. A wealth of Huawei's AI met users in China several months ago. AI features to help users write, edit pictures, and more were among its initial highlights.
The Mate XT, given its design, was quite expensive, starting at ¥19,999 (~$2,808). It seems likely we'll see a high price here in the U.S. should this teaser point toward the tri-fold. But, perhaps we are looking at a global launch of the Mate XT as the publication states it received ""confirmation"" that Huawei would do so in Q1 2025.

6,2025-02-05,"The days of Disney+ growing like gangbusters seem well and finally over. Disney stock is down slightly on Wednesday following its release of earnings for the final three months of 2024, which included the news that its eponymous streaming service lost 700,000 subscribers. The company expects further “modest” declines through 2025, perhaps the consequence of successive price increases, the institution of a crackdown on password sharing, and a reduction in content spend. Hulu was a bright spot, adding 1.6 million subscribers.
Disney+ now has 124.6 million subscribers, down from 125.3 million, while Hulu sits at 53.6 million subscribers, up from 52 million. Overall, Disney’s financial performance beat expectations, with earnings per share of $1.76 on revenue of $24.7 billion. Analysts on Wall Street had expected earnings of $1.43 per share on $24.55 billion in revenue. Disney’s parks did particularly well, which is something most other streamers do not have to supplement their streaming businesses.
After Bob Iger returned as CEO in 2022 because he just could not seem to give up power, he set out an aggressive plan to reach profitability in streaming with a promise that Disney+ would break even by the end of 2024. The company was able to achieve that, with the final three months of 2024 marking its third straight quarter of streaming profitability. That has required becoming more fiscally responsible and making its streaming services less enticing, including by raising prices, introducing an ad-supported tier, and more recently targeting password sharing.
Disney+ received a lot of criticism from fans who said the company was causing fatigue and watering down its IP by producing too much new content. After returning to the helm, Iger said Disney would reduce the amount of content it produced with the goal of improving the overall quality and profitability of streaming after several years of pumping out a monumental amount content to try and compete against Netflix. Investors on Wall Street were okay with heavy content spend for some time, but eventually began to demand that the likes of Disney and Warner Bros. stop bleeding cash and start returning profits.
Netflix has only continued to grow and maintain its lead as the clear winner in streaming. It added a record 19 million subscribers to close out 2024âwith total subscribers crossing 300 millionâand has found success with its introduction of an ad-supported tier and foray into live content, two initiatives that were unthinkable in the past. Netflix gets richer and richer while the rest of the streaming industry is looking like has-beens.
The problem for Disney and other streamers is that their catalogs remain much smaller than Netflix’s, and have higher churn. Consumers will sign up for a service, watch a new season of their favorite show, and then cancel. Netflix does not have the same churn problem because it has a huge backlog of content and continues to spend $17-18 billion per year on new content. It does not help that Disney+ is more geared towards children and teens, limiting its appeal; how many times do people really want to rewatch The Simpsons? Disney expects to spend $24 billion in 2025 on new content, but 40% of that goes towards sports rights; spending on new TV shows and movies might actually decrease.
Fortunately for Disney, it remains the king of programming for children, and was able to release some hit movies in 2024 after several years of successive flops like “Lightyear” and “Strange World.” Its lucrative theme parks also create for a flywheel effectâchildren who watch Disney content want to visit the parks, where passes are quite pricey these days. Which is to say, it makes sense to look at Disney+ more holistically as a service that reinforces the popularity of Disney’s other lines of business.
At least for parents, Disney+ will likely remain on the monthly credit card statement. Disney’s other service, ESPN+, might eventually be a bright spot as more sports moves to streaming.

We recently compiled a list of the 12 High Flying AI Stocks This Week. In this article, we are going to take a look at where International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) stands against the other high flying AI stocks.
In the artificial intelligence world, the spotlight will be shifting to France next week as the world awaits the US and China to find common ground over the safe development of artificial intelligence. Judging by the measured response from China over the tariffs issue, there is a chance it might. That noted, a wide variety of countries are going to be attending an AI Action Summit in Paris next week to discuss how to put the technology to work. France is going to be hosting the summit alongside India on Feb 10 and 11, focusing on areas such as open-source systems and clean energy for powering data centers, Reuters reported.

Meanwhile, the emergence of DeepSeek is increasingly turning into a game-changing event for AI development in China. The founder, Liang Wenfeng, is being hailed as a national hero. Indeed, his efforts have greatly helped the country to catch up with the US in the race toward AI supremacy. Chinese companies are increasingly rushing to support AI models coming from DeepSeek. Moore Threads and Hygon Information Technology, for instance, said on Monday that their computing clusters and accelerators will be able to support Deep Seek’s R1 and V3 models. Moore Threads, in particular, stated that progress by DeepSeek’s models using domestically made GPUs could set China's AI industry “on fire”.
While many of the companies in China are rushing to adopt DeepSeek, yet many others are pushing their own AI models forward. Alibaba Cloud released Qwen 2.5-Max just after DeepSeek over the holidays, Beijing-based start-up Zhipu is also in the AI race with its AI assistant app released in October, Chinese start-up Moonshot AI released its own LLM the day DeepSeek released its r1 model, and more. These moves by Chinese companies, and the broader market reaction in the US after the emergence of DeepSeek, reflect on how grave the impact has been on the AI world.

International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is a multinational technology company and a pioneer in artificial intelligence, offering AI consulting services and a suite of AI software products. On February 4th, Bank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and set a price target of $270.00. The rating, issued after IBM’s Investor Day, emphasized sustainable revenue and margin growth for IBM. CEO Arvind Krishna has been leading the company toward strategic transformation, with a portfolio shift towards higher growth areas such as software and consulting. As such, the company targets a topline growth of over 5% and anticipates an approximately 10% compound annual growth rate in this segment. Improvements in profit and free cash flow are also a plus point, while divested low-growth assets and mergers and acquisitions have strengthened both total and organic growth. Lastly, emphasis on areas such as quantum computing and AI-driven consulting services is expected to provide further growth potential. All of these factors have together led to the reiterated buy rating.
Overall IBM ranks 8th on our list of the high flying AI stocks this week. While we acknowledge the potential of IBM as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than IBM but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

8,2025-02-05,"Apple could be facing a potential Chinese antitrust investigation into its App Store policies and developer fees, reports Bloomberg. 
China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) is said to have been critically examining Apple's practices and holding discussions with the company since last year, specifically about its 30% commission on in-app purchases and restrictions on external payment services, according to the outlet's sources. 
Chinese regulators are said to be particularly focused on whether Apple's fees for local developers are unreasonably high. They're also examining if the company's prohibition of third-party app stores and payment methods stifles competition and negatively impacts Chinese consumers. ""If Apple resists making changes, the government may launch a formal investigation,"" Bloomberg's sources said.
The conversations are said to stem from long-running disputes between Apple and developers such as Tencent and ByteDance. A report in August said Apple had been putting pressure on them to make significant changes to two of China's most popular apps in order to remove loopholes that circumvent Apple's typical 30% commission.
The regulatory scrutiny comes at a time of escalating tensions between the United States and China. Just this week, SAMR announced a formal investigation into Google's practices moments after new US tariffs on Chinese goods took effect.
Apple's position in China is particularly delicate. The country serves as the primary manufacturing base for iPhones and is Apple's largest market outside the United States. It's also having to compete with increasingly confident local rivals like Huawei, with Apple reporting an 11% decline in revenue from China over the holiday quarter.
Apple is no stranger to regulatory scrutiny and has already had to implement a series of changes to avoid fines and other penalties elsewhere, including revamping its store practices in the European Union to comply with the Digital Markets Act.

Google tweaked one of its Super Bowl ads posted on YouTube after the AI featured in it displayed an inaccurate cheese statistic.

        The original video showing off Google's Gemini offerings in Workspace was posted five days ago and showed the AI generating a response for a small-business owner in Wisconsin. In the response, Gemini claims Gouda accounts for ""50 to 60% of the world's cheese consumption.""
    

        The edited ad now shows a Gemini response that says Gouda ""is one of the most popular cheeses in the world.""
    

        A Google spokesperson told Business Insider that it consulted with the business owner from the ad about how he would handle the situation ""after the question came up about the Gouda stat.""
    

        ""Following his suggestion to have Gemini rewrite the product description without the stat, we updated the UI to reflect what the business would do,"" the spokesperson said.
    

        A report about cheese market share published by global management consulting firm IMARC Group said that cheddar cheese ""accounts for the majority of the market at around 32.4%."" Gouda was not included in the report's top five by market share.
    

        Andrew Novakovic, the UV Baker professor of agricultural economics emeritus at Cornell University, told The Verge that Gouda ""is almost assuredly not the most widely consumed"" cheese globally.
    

        Jerry Dischler, president of Cloud applications at Google Cloud, replied to one user's post that called the stat ""unequivocally false."" Dischler said that Gemini's response was ""not a hallucination"" and that it was ""grounded in the web.""
    

        ""In this case, multiple sites across the web include the 50-60% stat,"" Dischler said. ""Gouda news: many love this cheese! Bada news: not everyone thinks it's as grate.""
    

        The incident highlights that in addition to industry-wide risks of hallucination, AI products that are trained on or pull information from the web aren't necessarily providing fact-checked responses. The Gouda stat, for example, does exist on a website called Cheese.com.
    

        It's not the first time Google has displayed incorrect information in a video promoting its AI. Last spring, the tech giant released a promo video in which Gemini provided a list of solutions to a photographer dealing with camera issues. One of the suggested solutions would have destroyed the photographer's photos.
    

        Similarly, in 2023, a Google demo video showing off its Bard chatbot incorrectly stated the James Webb Space Telescope was the first to photograph an exoplanet. It was actually taken by a telescope operated by the European Southern Observatory, according to NASA.
    

        The tech giant also made headlines due to inaccuracies generated by its AI Overviews feature, which appears at the top of some search queries. Last year, it caused an online stir when it said to put glue in pizza sauce to prevent the cheese from falling off.
    

        Google's Super Bowl ad is a good reminder of evergreen advice that applies to anyone using AI tools: Just because an AI says something confidently, it doesn't mean that it's true.

11,2025-02-05,"The Nasdaq and other major stock market indexes dipped  Wednesday after underwhelming earnings reports from Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Other tech stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Tesla (TSLA) were also in the red.
In the afternoon,  the tech-heavy Nasdaq was down about 0.05%, while the  Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 added about 0.28% and 0.13%, respectively.
Shares of Alphabet (GOOGL) fell more than 7% as the tech giant missed Wall Street’s earnings expectations for the fourth quarter despite “robust momentum across the business.” The Google parent reported revenues of $96.5 billion for the fourth quarter — a 12% increase year-over-year. Alphabet reported earnings of $2.15 per share, up 31% from the previous year, and net income of $26.5 billion for the quarter ended in December.
The company was expected to report revenues of $96.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024, according to analysts’ estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS). Net income was expected at $26.2 billion, while analysts estimated earnings of $2.13 per share.
Shares in chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) fell 7% after the company’s fourth-quarter data center revenue missed expectations.
Disney’s (DIS) streaming business once again turned a profit last quarter. But its flagship platform is starting to lose subscribers.
The House of Mouse on Wednesday released its fiscal first-quarter results, with growth being driven primarily by the company’s box office dominance and profit gains in its streaming business. After rising 2.5% in the morning, the company’s shares were down 1.63% in the afternoon.
Sales of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO)  blockbuster weight loss drug Wegovy doubled in the fourth quarter, but the Danish pharmaceutical giant warns that sales growth for all its drugs — including Ozempic — is expected to slow in the coming year.
Wegovy sales skyrocketed 107% to 19.8 billion Danish Krone ($2.8 billion) in the fourth-quarter of 2024, compared with in 9.6 billion Danish Krone ($1.4 billion) during the the same period last year. The drug just beat analysts’ expectations of $2.7 billion, according to a consensus estimate from FactSet.
The company’s stock rose nearly 4.8% in the afternoon.

The Best-Tasting GreensGroove Greens PowderRead more
A Balanced SupplementLive It Up Super GreensRead more
The health supplement market is both booming and, as far as the FDA is concerned, unregulated. I took a deep dive into the world of greens powders, speaking with dietitians and trying popular brands to uncover whether or not they're worth the money—and if so, which ones are.
In short, greens powders aren’t harmful, but ultimately, dietitians agree (see below) that they're not a replacement for a healthy, varied diet. You need to eat your greens, plain and simple. Your body needs fruits and veggies.
For most people, greens powders are going to be an expensive product that may or may not help them out. But if you’re someone who doesn’t eat enough fruits and veggies, and you speak with your doctor beforehand to ensure the ingredients are safe based on your own medical history and needs, greens powders may help bridge the gap. They’re sort of like multivitamins (which are also unregulated by the FDA)—your body will take what it needs and flush the rest down the toilet. And if you don’t know what your body is lacking, the best and likely least expensive course of action is to go to the doctor and figure it out before you start throwing vitamin spaghetti at the wall that is your overall health.
Ultimately, you (and your doctor!) should figure out which powder—if any—is best for your needs. But in the past few weeks, I’ve tried a ton of them. And I have noticed better, smoother digestion; heightened energy levels; and a general sense of wellness. I love fruits and veggies, but I also tend to eat like a 5-year-old with access to grown-up money. One personal anecdote that may be useful is that drinking a greens smoothie in the morning makes me feel healthier all day. You know how when you have a super healthy meal for lunch, you think more carefully about what you’ll have for dinner? Greens powders make me consider my choices carefully all day long. I drink more water, I eat more mindfully, and I feel like a Fitness Queen much more so than on the days where I wait until 4 pm to eat anything but coffee.
I think greens powders make sense for me as a supplement, but I refuse to be separated from my kale salads and fruit plates. Or my Hot Cheetos. Life is about balance, after all.

How I Tested
I drank each green powder at least three times (unless otherwise listed), first thing in the morning, on an empty stomach. I mixed the recommended serving size with 10 to 12 ounces of cold water. I tested one powder at a time before moving to the next a few days later.
Experts Weigh In
Shelley Balls, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Consumer Health Digest, says that while greens powders may be beneficial when used in addition to a healthy diet, they fail to provide your body with adequate dietary fiber, and they’re not a substitute for a poor eating pattern. She’d recommend spending your money on “whole foods that contain ample sources of dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals, over green powders.” She also says that if you like the convenience of greens powders, “you might find frozen, canned, and pre-washed/chopped options helpful to boost your veggie intake.”
Dawn Menning, a registered dietitian and director for digital health with the Nutu App, agrees, saying that, “According to the CDC, only 10 percent of American adults meet the dietary recommendations for fruits and vegetables. With that in mind, green powders may be a convenient way for some individuals to fill in these nutritional gaps. But green powders shouldn’t replace eating whole fruits and vegetables.” She adds that if you already eat a healthy variety of fruits and veggies, “you probably don’t need a green powder.”
One thing to consider in the “pro” category: Per Trista Best, a registered dietitian at Balance One Supplements, “green powder supplements can be beneficial for vegetarians” because they can help fill nutritional gaps, especially regarding iron. She says, “Iron is one key nutrient that may be lacking in a vegetarian diet. While iron is found in a variety of plant-based foods, it is not as easily absorbed by the body as the iron found in meat.”
And when it comes to “super” ingredients, a word often emblazoned across the packaging of various greens powders, like spirulina or adaptogens, Balls says that there are some possible benefits but that there isn’t an abundance of research that supports their use. And some of these ingredients can interact with certain medications or trigger autoimmune disorders.
Bloom is the brand I’ve used the longest. Senior commerce editor Kat Merck also drank Bloom for a long time. I’ve tried a few different flavors of Bloom greens, including Strawberry Kiwi (a hit!), Mango (a huge miss!), and Pineapple (somewhere in the middle). I didn’t think it was too sweet until I started trying other brands for this guide. The flavors can be quite saccharine in comparison to other brands and have left me with an artificial taste in my mouth. They don’t taste bad—they just lean too sweet for me, even if I dilute the powder more than it calls for.
Each serving has 20 calories, 4 grams of cabohydrates, 2 grams of dietary fiber, 150 percent of your daily Vitamin B12, 3 percent of your daily iron, and very low sodium. There are pre- and probiotics, fruits and veggies, antioxidants, adaptogens, and digestive enzymes. I did notice that Bloom’s powders helped me feel less bloated, and they helped regulate some of my digestive issues. And I do like the tub packaging, which doesn’t take up too much room on my counter and is easier to use than bulky bags. Ultimately, if you don’t want your greens to taste like greens, Bloom is worth checking out.
You’ve probably seen commercials for AG1 on YouTube or social media. The sleek, minimalist branding makes it feel elite compared to some other brands. And the same thought is put into the packaging—my AG1 kit came complete with a metal scoop and a slick metal storage canister. AG1 is unique because the powder requires refrigeration due to the live probiotics and whole-food ingredients. The canister makes it feel a little more luxe than other stuff that lives on your kitchen counter. Just be aware that it will be crazy dusty in your kitchen when you dump the pack of greens into the canister. I also got a sleek plastic shaker bottle that worked fine. It wasn’t as good as my dedicated shaker bottle, but it was easy to hold and certainly made me look more like a world-class athlete.
AG1 has a strange flavor that’s hard to describe. It sort of tastes milky, fruity, vegetable-y, and meaty? All at once? It’s not unpleasant, but it definitely tastes like Health Food. The company says it tastes like vanilla and pineapple, and you’ll also get notes of papaya, broccoli, cherry, carrot, and a bit of stevia. There are no artificial flavors, sweeteners, or additives. I don’t think it tastes bad at all. It just tastes healthy. Each serving contains 50 calories, 6 grams of carbohydrates, 2 grams of fiber, 2 grams of protein, and very low sodium. There are 75 total ingredients, including vitamins and minerals, pre- and probiotics, stress adaptogens, antioxidants, “superfoods and mushrooms,” and ingredients for digestion support.
I noticed smoother digestion, higher baseline energy levels, and healthier skin. One thing I’ll note is that AG1 is quite expensive—$99 for a monthly supply. That’s a whole lot of money for something that could arguably be replaced by a healthy diet. Another thing to note is that AG1 is NSF certified, meaning it’s been tested by an independent third party that certifies the ingredients listed are exactly what’s in the product. I think it’s overpriced, point blank period. But if you feel inclined to spend $100 a month on a thing that may or may not benefit you, it’s a fine option.
I tried the Wild Strawberry Kiwi flavor of Groove, which tasted fantastic—fresh, sweet, bright—and the Ginger Peach flavor, which was a little spicy, a little sweet, and reminded me of a wellness juice shot. Both were delicious. One thing I will say is that the scoop design has a little groove on the back that collects powder and makes things a bit messy, so I recommend storing the scoop outside of the powder bag. It also took a little bit longer to dissolve than some other brands I tried. But it tastes like a mocktail or a bottled juice, not like a supplement.
Each serving contains 20 calories, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 2 grams of fiber, your daily values of vitamins C and D, a ton of Vitamin B12, plus 8 percent of your daily iron.  There are superfoods, vitamins, minerals, fiber (not much, but it’s there), antioxidants, probiotics, and digestive enzymes. The brand touts Alpha GPC (a form of choline), freeze-dried coconut water, and of course the ever-buzzy superfoods like various grasses and spirulina. I noticed higher energy levels than with other greens powders I tried, less bloating, and happier digestion. Let it be known that these greens don’t taste like fruits or veggies at all, really. If you want your greens to taste more green, another brand might be a better option. But for me, this hit the spot.
This greens powder is very subtle. It’s almost unflavored, both the plain version and the Wild Berry version. The instructions aren’t super clear—the packaging says to add a scoop to juice, water, or milk. I mixed mine with 10 ounces of water and it was fine. It didn’t taste great and it didn’t taste bad. It’s vaguely earthy, a little sweet, but mostly neutral. Because of that, I think this is the best candidate for mixing into other drinks. You’ll get a kick of “healthy” flavor without risking overpowering whatever it is you’re drinking.
Each serving contains 25 calories, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 2 grams of protein, 3 grams of dietary fiber, a bunch of vitamins (including K, A, B1, B2, B3, B6, B12, and B5), folate, calcium, iron, magnesium, iodine … the list goes on. The brand lists each ingredient and the reasons for inclusion on the website, a deep dive that I appreciate (though again, these are not regulated by the FDA). You’ll get probiotics. You’ll get enzymes. You’ll get the superest of superfoods. I noticed higher energy levels and a healthier-feeling gut. If you already have a morning smoothie routine going, or you want something that tastes healthy without tasting like straight-up grass, I think adding in this powder makes sense.
A longtime staple at my exurban Costco, a bag of Zena Greens comes with 30 (or 45 at the big-box store) portable 0.4-ounce stick packets of powder. “I put it in smoothies!” the sample vendor told me the last time I walked by, which is really more of a warning than a suggestion, as I can confirm after drinking it for nearly four months that the texture is slightly gritty, with a taste and appearance strongly reminiscent of algae. (One Amazon reviewer described it as “‘I'm drinking a salad’ flavor.”)
This is to be expected, as organic spirulina powder is number five on the extensive list of ingredients, which also includes 5 grams of fiber—more than any of the powders we tested—plus 1 mg of iron, 29 mg of calcium, and 2 grams of protein. The flavor (I’ve only tried Mixed Berry) does little to mitigate the taste and texture, so this isn't exactly a “beginner” option for those trying powdered greens for the first time. However, it is a worthwhile step up from a more palatable powder like Bloom, as it has 70+ superfoods and probiotics in addition to the decent serving of fiber—many days I’ve gotten away with one packet as a breakfast. —Kat Merck
Powdered supplements can take a while to dissolve, but a shaker bottle helps speed things along. I’ve tried many different bottles from BlenderBottle, and while they’re all great, the dishwasher-safe Strada Tritan is my favorite. It’s available in many different color combinations—if you buy on BlenderBottle's website, you can choose the bottle color and the ball color—and it has handy measurement lines on the sides. The flip cap is easy to drink from, and it locks as well for extra leak protection. Press the button to flip the lid and take a sip, then close the lid and slide the switch to lock it. Easy-peasy.
The bottle doesn’t absorb any odors, even if you accidentally leave it in your gym bag for an undisclosed period of time, and the whisking balls (both the plastic Color model and the traditional Wire model) dissolve powder superfast. The inner seal even has a little tab so you can pull it out and clean it separately. I’ve used this cup for greens, creatine, and protein powders, and it always mixes up my drinks in just a few seconds of shaking.
Huel Daily Greens for $50: Huel’s greens powders come in a big bag with a scoop, and an optional shaker bottle that is included for free if you purchase from the Huel website for the first time. The normal flavor is horrifyingly bad. I am not a person who gags easily, ever, and I thought I was going to actually hurl as I walked around my kitchen gagging after trying it. It is oddly reminiscent of banana, but specifically the white stringy parts of a banana, mixed with the way dog food smells. It’s bitter, savory, and vaguely sweet at the same time. I could only sip it a few times to get those tasting notes down before I dumped it down the drain. The Watermelon flavor is, somehow, even worse. Like if you drank whole milk mixed with a watermelon seltzer water and added in a dash of white button mushrooms. I won’t tell you what’s in this powder because I can’t in good conscience recommend it to you. Even if you hate the taste of Brussels sprouts, I promise they’re still preferable to this supplement. And! To add insult to injury, this vile powder made me gassy, which I am unfortunately admitting to you here on the internet in the hope that it further persuades you to try something else.

From the MBA: Mortgage Applications Increase in Latest MBA Weekly SurveyMortgage applications increased 2.2 percent from one 
week earlier, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association’s (MBA) Weekly Mortgage 
Applications Survey for the week ending January 31, 2025. Last week’s results include an adjustment for 
the Martin Luther King holiday.

The Market Composite Index, a measure of mortgage loan application volume, increased 2.2 percent on 
a seasonally adjusted basis from one week earlier. On an unadjusted basis, the Index increased 19
percent compared with the previous week. The Refinance Index increased 12 percent from the previous 
week and was 17 percent higher than the same week one year ago. The seasonally adjusted Purchase 
Index decreased 4 percent from one week earlier. The unadjusted Purchase Index increased 15 percent
compared with the previous week and was 0.2 percent higher than the same week one year ago.

“Mortgage rates moved lower last week, consistent with lower Treasury yields following the FOMC 
meeting and a volatile week for stock market. The 30-year fixed rate declined to its lowest level in six 
weeks at 6.97 percent,” said Joel Kan, MBA’s Vice President and Deputy Chief Economist. “Mortgage 
applications responded to these lower rates and were up for the week overall, driven by a 12 percent 
increase in refinance applications, which had their strongest week since December 2024.”

Added Kan, “Purchase activity had a tougher week, with declines across all loan types. The average loan 
size for a purchase loan has increased since the start of the year and continued that trend last week with 
weaker government purchase activity, which reached $447,300, the highest level since October 2024.”

...
The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances 
($766,550 or less) decreased to 6.97 percent from 7.02 percent, with points increasing to 0.64 from 0.63
(including the origination fee) for 80 percent loan-to-value ratio (LTV) loans.

The first graph shows the MBA mortgage purchase index.

According to the MBA, purchase activity is up 0.2% year-over-year unadjusted. Red is a four-week average (blue is weekly).  Purchase application activity is up about 25% from the lows in late October 2023 and is now 4% above the lowest levels during the housing bust.  The second graph shows the refinance index since 1990.
The refinance index remains very low.

No.  I strongly predict that it will not in fact become a trade war flashpoint, because the current US administration, whose policy is determined solely by the whims and prejudices of the President himself, does not view Apple as an ally.  This attitude will likely not be changed no matter how much humiliating obeisance and open bribery Apple performs in an effort to gain the status of ally to the administration.

16,2025-02-05,"RDNA 4 is about to give NVIDIA some much-needed competition in the GPU market.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

The prolonged wait for new Radeon RDNA 4 graphics cards will soon be over: AMD's next-gen GPUs are launching in ""early March"" according to AMD CEO Lisa Su in the most recent AMD Q4 2024 Earnings Call.
With NVIDIA's recent launch of RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 flagship GPUs without any real availability — not to mention relatively minor gains in terms of raw performance compared to RTX 40-series hardware — AMD's opportunity to capture the mid-range market has never been better.
In the call, Su specifically called out AMD's GPU revenue decline in 2024 as the company sold off its last-gen RDNA 3 stock to make room for the new Radeon hardware. Here's the full section regarding RDNA 4:
""In Gaming Graphics, revenue declined year over year, as we accelerated channel sellout in preparation for the launch of our next-gen Radeon 9000 series GPUs. Our focus with this generation is to address the highest volume portion of the enthusiast gaming market with our new RDNA 4 architecture. RDNA 4 delivers significantly better rate tracing performance and add support for AI-powered upscaling technology that will bring high-quality 4K gaming to mainstream players when the first Radeon 9070 series GPUs go on sale in early March.""
This news, spotted by PCGamer, comes just a couple of weeks after AMD VP and GM of Ryzen and Radeon David McAfee took to X (formerly Twitter) to share a similar launch date. McAfee only mentioned ""March"" as a launch time, so at least we now know we won't have to wait quite as long. That's especially great news for anyone who's been waiting to upgrade and didn't manage to land an NVIDIA card.
Radeon 9000 series hardware and software are looking great and we are planning to have a wide assortment of cards available globally. Can’t wait for gamers to get their hands on the cards when they go on sale in March!January 20, 2025
This all comes on the heels of AMD's modified CES 2025 presentation that didn't end up mentioning RDNA 4 at all despite press kits being sent out to media outlets. In the press kit, RDNA 4 was revealed with new Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 desktop GPUs. AMD even had a booth at CES showing off improvements in FidelityFX Super Resolution 4, which has changed over to a machine-learning approach to better compete with NVIDIA's DLSS. FSR 4 looks like quite an improvement over its FSR 3.1 predecessor, and it's one of the main reasons why I might opt for a new RDNA 4 GPU when the time comes.

Rumors have it that retailers have been building up RDNA 4 stock since early 2025, and some cards have apparently even made it into the hands of reviewers. My initial reaction to McAfee's launch news was positive, and I surmised that AMD would likely benefit from the delay.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
NVIDIA isn't doing itself any favors with severely limited RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 stock, which will likely still be plaguing shoppers in early March. Of course, NVIDIA is still expected to launch its RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 in February, which could come with better availability. Regardless, AMD's new Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 are expected to go toe-to-toe with NVIDIA's 5070-series cards.
AMD has two avenues to success, and both will likely hinge on what NVIDIA does with its February launch. If the RTX 5070 and 5070 Ti outperform AMD's new GPUs, AMD can lower the price and draw in value-conscious consumers. If AMD's new GPUs come out ahead of NVIDIA's mid-range cards, they'll likely sell themselves as long as there's solid availability.

NVIDIA is in dire need of stronger GPU competition, especially in the mid-range market. Intel's ""Battlemage"" GPUs are mighty impressive, but they target the budget range of the market. That leaves AMD to go up against the RTX 5070 and RTX 5070 Ti with new RDNA 4 hardware.
Beyond giving NVIDIA some competition, AMD desperately needs a win for its gaming division. As Lisa Su mentions in the earnings call, ""revenue declined 59% year over year to $563 million"" in the gaming segment.
Su notes that part of the decline comes from declining console sales:
""Semi-custom sales declined as expected as Microsoft and Sony focused on reducing channel inventory. Overall, this console generation has been very strong. Highlighted by cumulative unit shipments surpassing $100 million in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we believe channel inventories have now normalized and semi-custom sales will return to more historical patterns in 2025.""
Heading into 2025, AMD plans to ""combine the client and the gaming segment into one single reportable segment to align with how we manage the business.""
AMD needs to make a positive impression with its RDNA 4 GPUs, not just to appease shareholders, but also to give consumers more choice on the open market. NVIDIA's RTX 5000 GPUs so far stand unopposed, and that needs to change in March.

20,2025-02-05,"Business Insider Edition 
As a vegan of 13 years, Christina Soteriou, a chef and recipe developer based in London, has learned how to add plant-based protein to her meals in quick, simple ways.

        The 32-year-old grew up in Cyprus following a Mediterranean diet, which has been linked to many health benefits, including a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and better gut health. It emphasizes plant-based sources of protein that are cheap and nutrient-dense, such as legumes, beans, and lentils
    

Protein in all its forms has become buzzy in recent years amid growing awareness that it can help with building and keeping muscle mass, as well as maintaining a healthy weight because it's filling and prevents overeating.
    

        The US government recommends people eat 0.36 g of protein per pound of body weight, or at least 46 grams for women and 56g for men. For building lean muscle mass, research suggests 0.7 grams per pound a day is ideal.
    

        The global protein market is estimated to grow from $26 billion in 2021 to over $47.4 billion by 2032, according to Statista, as grocery stores stock more protein-enhanced foods, from pasta to soda.
    

        But Soteriou, who taught herself to cook vegan food growing up, knows you don't need to spend much or take supplements to get enough protein.
    

        Each day, Soteriou, the author of the ""Big Veg Energy"" recipe book, makes sure she eats at least one substantial source of protein each day, such as tofu or beans, and tops up with other foods throughout the day.
    

        ""Little sprinkles of seeds here and there, or a drizzle of tahini even has protein in it,"" she said.
    

        Soteriou shared three other hacks for eating more plant-based protein without sacrificing flavor.
    

        Nichola Ludlam-Raine, a dietitian and the author of ""How Not to Eat Ultra-Processed,"" said these are well-balanced suggestions for eating more protein, which also provide fiber and essential micronutrients.
    

        Legumes such as chickpeas, lima beans, and lentils, are good sources of protein and high in fiber. They all contain at least 8g of protein per 100g.
    

        Soteriou finds it helpful to keep pre-cooked packs of legumes in her store cupboard, which she adds to dishes to bulk up the protein content.
    

        ""If you're eating a soup, let's say, can you throw some beans in? Or if you're having a salad, will some chickpeas go in there?"" she said.
    

        Tofu has a reputation for being tasteless unless you spend hours marinating it, Soteriou said, but she disagrees.
    

        ""It can be so versatile. As it's quite plain, it can really lend itself to different things. So you can bake it, you can stir fry it, you can air fry it,"" she said.
    

        Silken tofu, which is the softest type, can be blended into a cream and used in a sauce, a salad dressing, or seasoned and drizzled over roasted vegetables.
    

        Firmer tofu can be crumbled into small pieces, covered with lots of salt and lemon juice, and sprinkled over a salad like feta.
    

        ""It's just a fun way to add more protein,"" she said.
    

        Nutritional yeast is an inactive version of the yeast used to make bread or beer. It has a savory, umami flavor and is often used as a plant-based alternative to cheese.
    

        It comes in powder or flake form and is a complete protein. One teaspoon contains around three grams of protein.
    

        Soteriou always has some in her kitchen and likes to sprinkle it over dishes for extra protein.
    

        ""You can even sprinkle it onto your pasta,"" she said.

22,2025-02-05,"Salesforce has not commented on the reported job cuts, making it unclear which specific departments may be affected.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

At the beginning of the year, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff indicated that the company is seriously debating hiring new software engineers due to the ""incredible productivity gains"" from agentic AIs.
As it happens, the company is set to lay off up to 1,000 employees from its workforce (via Bloomberg). Oddly, Salesforce is currently recruiting new employees in its market division to sell its AI-powered products and services.
Salesforce has remained quiet about the reported job cuts, making it difficult to determine which departments within the organization will be affected. However, sources with close affiliations with the company disclosed that affected employees should be able to apply for other positions within the company, potentially including the AI sales positions.
For context, Salesforce had up to 73,000 employees as of January 2024, meaning up to 1.36% of the company's workforce will be affected by the job cuts.
While speaking at an event hosted by Barclays Plc in December 2024, CEO Brian Millham highlighted the company's profit-driven focus:
“Just because we have a hit new product doesn’t mean that we ignore the commitments we’ve made internally and externally as we think about scaling this business. We’re looking across the entire company to say, ‘Where can we get more efficiencies? How can we continue to get fuel for the work that we’re doing to go invest in scale going forward?”
Salesforce isn't the only company that has been affected by job cuts. In January, Microsoft announced two rounds of layoffs. First, the company announced performance-based job cuts across departments, including security, slated to impact ""less than 1%"" of the workforce. Later, the Redmond giant was hit by another round of layoffs, impacting employees across security, experiences, sales, devices, and gaming departments.
All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.
More recently, the company announced a hiring freeze, impacting its consulting business in the U.S. as part of its broader plans to cut costs.
Meta's workforce is on the chopping board, too. The Facebook maker is expected to make performance-based cuts, slated to impact approximately 5%. According to CEO Mark Zuckerberg:
“We typically manage out people who aren’t meeting expectations over the course of a year, but now we’re going to do more extensive performance-based cuts during this cycle.""
Elsewhere, Zuckerberg painted a picture of a potential future at Meta where mid-level AI engineers might claim coding jobs from software engineers.

23,2025-02-05,Fintech play Fiserv reported earnings early Wednesday and stormed higher.
24,2025-02-05,"Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) tumbled more than 10% on Wednesday morning, hitting a new 52-week low despite the semiconductor giant exceeding revenue expectations in its latest earnings report. The shares were trading at $108 each in the morning.
In its fourth-quarter earnings report released Tuesday, the Santa Clara-based chipmaker posted mixed results. Net income was $482 million, down 28% from $667 million a year earlier.  Gaming segment revenue dropped significantly, falling 59% year-over-year to $563 million. 
But revenue came in at $7.66 billion, exceeding the anticipated $7.53 billion. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.09, slightly surpassing analysts’ expectations of $1.08.
AMD projected total sales of $6.8 billion to $7.4 billion for the current quarter, compared to analysts’ average estimate of $7.04 billion. 
Although AMD lags behind its rival Nvidia (NVDA) in selling chips for data centers, its data center unit has become the company’s most crucial business segment. Recent growth has been driven by rising demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used in artificial intelligence. In the latest quarter, AMD reported $3.86 billion in data center sales, marking a 69% year-over-year increase.
“Data Center segment annual revenue nearly doubled as EPYC processor adoption accelerated and we delivered more than $5 billion of AMD Instinct accelerator revenue,” said AMD Chair and CEO Dr. Lisa Su. 
The company, which has been struggling with costs, reduced its global workforce by 4% in November 2024 in an attempt to focus on competing in the AI chip market. In January, AMD introduced new AI PC and gaming processors at the Consumer Electronics Show. The new Ryzen AI Max Series chips are designed for high-performance computing in “thin and light notebooks.”

26,2025-02-05,"Vision Pro has officially entered its second year on the market. Apple’s spatial computer was chosen as 9to5Mac’s 2024 Product of the Year, but it still has a lot to prove heading into year two. Here are three coming upgrades that could spark a growth year for Vision Pro.
Apple neglecting to bring AI to its flagship, cutting-edge spatial computer in 2024 was a disappointment—but understandable. The company’s playing catch-up with AI and rightfully prioritized its most popular devices: the iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
But Apple Intelligence is on its way to Vision Pro, likely in visionOS 3. And there’s one main area it could make a significant impact: an upgraded Siri.
Plenty of other AI features will make nice additions to visionOS, but a more powerful Siri easily tops my list.
I’m still a relatively new Vision Pro owner, but I’ve quickly found Siri more important to spatial computing than any other Apple platform (save HomePod).
Voice-first computing has tremendous potential on Vision Pro, and Siri’s ChatGPT integration plus the powerful upgrades coming in iOS 18.4 would make a huge difference to the visionOS experience.
For years, Apple has been trying to prove that it’s serious about gaming. The iPhone has always been a gaming hit, but Apple has also tried to convince users (and developers) to invest in gaming on the Mac, Apple TV, and more.
But somehow, the Vision Pro launched without much of a gaming story. Apple Arcade offers a variety of spatial games, and others are available on the App Store. But there are currently no VR game controllers supported, and Apple doesn’t seem to think of visionOS as a gaming platform.
Fortunately, it sounds like PlayStation VR2 controllers will be supported soon. Additionally, a recent game developer survey indicates that a lot more Vision Pro games are coming than what’s been announced so far.
Apple needs to prove in year two that gaming is a priority for Vision Pro. Otherwise, all the best VR games will continue being exclusive to competing platforms.
Immersive Video is one of the most remarkable, ‘killer app’-style features on the Vision Pro. The only problem is, demand for content has significantly outweighed supply—for now.
Apple wrapped up last year with an increase of regular Immersive Video releases, and that’s bound to continue in the year ahead as recent developments point to big plans for new content.
The variety of different Immersive Video releases so far shows how much Apple is experimenting with this new medium, and how much potential is there for the future.
I hope Vision Pro can become a true productivity platform, but that’s still up for debate. What’s undeniable is that Immersive Video can make Vision Pro a killer entertainment device.
If Apple succeeds on all three fronts above, Vision Pro should start to become a lot more compelling to a lot more people. Price, weight, and app ecosystem are all important factors too. But the more Apple can do to make visionOS a true computing platform, with strong gaming and video experiences too, the brighter Vision Pro’s future will be.
What Vision Pro upgrades do you hope to see this year? Let us know in the comments.

27,2025-02-05,"A slew of major American technology stocks pulled back Wednesday, as the latest batch of fourth-quarter earnings and an increasingly complicated operating environment for multinational companies ate at Wall Street’s risk appetite.
An ever-shifting geopolitical backdrop has weighed on the minds of investors.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq index dipped 0.7% shortly after market open.
Leading the losses was an 8% drop for Google parent Alphabet, a slide which erased as much as $211 billion in market value after the company’s earnings report revealed weaker Q4 revenues than consensus analyst forecasts and far higher 2025 spending guidance than anticipated, as Alphabet stock paces toward its biggest percentage loss since October 2023.
Also struggling after their company’s earnings reports were shares of semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices and ride-hailer Uber.
AMD stock tanked 10% to their cheapest level since 2023 after the firm fell short of estimates in its artificial intelligence-focused datacenter division, while Uber stock fell 7% after the company predicted lower-than-expected ride revenue during 2025’s first three months.
Notable fallers not tied to quarterly results included iPhone maker Apple, and Elon Musk’s electric vehicle producer Tesla, both of which suffered about 2% share price declines.
Apple’s drop followed a Bloomberg report Chinese regulators are considering an antitrust investigation into Apple over its App Store fees, a possible retaliation to President Donald Trump’s 10% additional tariffs on U.S. imports of Chinese goods. Tesla’s dip came after the company reportedly suffered its worst month for new car sales in Germany since 2021 and France since 2022, a potential consequence of Musk’s outspoken support for right-wing politicians including Germany’s Alternative for Deutschland party. The Nasdaq is still up 1% in 2025, but it’s been a rocky path to those gains, as tariffs and the heated U.S.-China generative AI competition weighed on investors’ minds.
Also down Wednesday were New York-listed shares of Chinese companies. Online retailers Alibaba and Temu parent Pinduoduo, the two most valuable U.S.-traded Chinese firms, both suffered about 2% drops as investors reacted to an increasingly messy trade conflict between the U.S. and China, which most recently resulted in the U.S. Postal Service briefly pausing acceptance of all packages from China and Hong Kong.

Good morning. The US Agency for International Development, or USAID, will place nearly all of its direct-hire workforce on administrative leave starting Friday at midnight, according to an email sent to staff on Tuesday evening and posted on the agency's website.

        Meanwhile, in today's big story, we're breaking down how the China tariffs will impact what you pay for things.
    

What's on deck


Markets: What Trump's plan for a US sovereign wealth fund could look like.
    

Tech: An Amazon VP reiterated the company's commitment to DEI initiatives in an internal meeting.
    

Business: The White House says more than 20,000 federal workers have taken buyouts, and more will come.
    

        But first, the tariff fight isn't over.
    

If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.


The trade war between Washington and Beijing is set to take place in US consumers' wallets.


        From new phones to kitchen appliances and clothes, President Donald Trump's additional 10% tax on Chinese imports could result in a slew of higher prices, write Theron Mohamed and Ayelet Sheffey.
    

        With China sending $427 billion in goods to the US in 2023 (the most recent year of full data), there are no shortages of things that will be affected by the tariffs.
    

        It's not just expensive tech like computers and cellphones that's at risk. The closure of a loophole allowing importers to avoid taxes on shipments valued less than $800 when sent directly to consumers has left brands like Shein and Temu scrambling.
    

        Concerns about logistics continued yesterday when the US Postal Service said that it is suspending inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong until further notice, effective immediately. While only parcels are impacted, the suspension may cause exporters to use alternative logistics companies like DHL, UPS, and FedEx. That might cause a demand surge that could increase freight costs, an expert told BI.
    

        PDD Holdings, Temu's parent company, was down 6% in premarket trading this morning following the USPS announcement.
    

        Companies haven't been shy about saying they'll need to raise prices due to tariffs, and the taxes also provide cover to juice their costs regardless of the tariffs' real impact.
    

        Even trade plans that might never come to fruition — Mexico and Canada — could still cause enough uncertainty that they disrupt supply chains, leading to higher prices.
    

        With so many unknowns, some investors are hedging their bets using outcome ETFs and monitoring 21-day realized volatility to reduce downside risk while not completely cannibalizing their returns.
    

        If that all sounds like a foreign language to you, there's always the prediction markets. Over there, you can wager on where some of President Trump's next tariffs might land.
    

Another corner of the economy is leaving US consumers feeling pretty beat.


        Rising egg prices are so severe that Waffle House is charging a 50-cent fee for each egg it sells. The restaurant chain said it opted for a surcharge over a blanket price increase across its menu.
    

        The eggs-tra fee is only supposed to be temporary, but this won't be over easy. Data from the US Department of Agriculture projects the average price for a dozen eggs won't drop from $4.80 to $2.50 until the second quarter.
    

        That's not egg-celent news, but it's tough to blame anyone. As BI's Emily Stewart previously covered, a combination of bird flu and increased demand has scrambled the egg market.
    
Shares of Chinese companies linked to DeepSeek surged on the first post-holiday trading day.
1. How exactly would a US sovereign wealth fund work? President Trump asked the Treasury and Commerce departments to come up with a plan for creating a fund to invest on behalf of the country. The strategy, however, is typically used to manage a country's surplus. The US is running on a deficit. Here's how it could still work.
2. Learning from the investing wizards. Author Jack Schwager is adding a sixth book to his popular ""Market Wizards"" series, and he's co-writing it with financial writer and researcher George Coyle. It will focus on the early days of top traders' careers and feature interviews from a mix of well-known names and those who are unknown but ""have done spectacularly well,"" Schwager said.
3. Apollo is exploring ""modest M&A."" The firm is changing tack from its former focus on execution and looking to grow through new M&A, CEO Marc Rowan said on the firm's final 2024 earnings call. Apollo's looking for companies that can help expand its lending capabilities, Rowan said, and he pointed to a recent acquisition as an example.
1. Google's AI bets and cloud sales slump. Parent company Alphabet plans for $75 billion in capex this year. Some investors are wary of big AI spending — and want earnings to match. Despite consolidated revenue growth, Google Cloud sales didn't meet expectations. Executives did mention a potential bright spot, though: YouTube podcasts.
2. An Amazon exec reaffirms company's DEI commitment. When Amazon changed some of its websites about DEI and halted some programs, some employees wondered whether the company might do away with it like Meta. That's not the case, according to AWS VP of technology Mai-Lan Tomsen Bukovec. In a late January meeting, Tomsen Bukovec told employees there is ""no change"" to the company's DEI commitment and that the edits employees noticed were alterations of language, not principle.
3. Connecting the dots between Apple, a porn app, and Trump's possible trade war. The three make unlikely bedfellows, but they set the stage for a tiff between Big Tech and the EU. The key word: regulation. Apple and the other tech giants have beef with the EU over its app store rules, and they're hoping Trump — and the threat of tariffs — might join the fight.
1. Federal workers say some DOGE members aren't sharing their full names in meetings. One federal employee told BI they've never seen anything like it. These meetings, which include questions from DOGE reps about responsibilities and areas of improvement, appear to be part of its push to revamp the federal workforce. Thomas Shedd, a former Tesla employee who recently joined the GSA, told staff he was trying to protect DOGE members from media attention. However, the interactions come as DOGE promises to promote transparency.
2. The rise of the reluctant landlord. As workers face an uptick in RTO mandates, some homeowners may have to ditch the homes they purchased during peak remote work. But it's not an ideal time to sell a home right now, thanks to high mortgage rates and weakening demands. Many would-be sellers are turning to the rental market instead — but being a landlord isn't all it's cracked up to be either.
3. The White House says more than 20,000 federal workers have taken buyouts. The figure is still well below the White House's goal of 5 - 10% of federal workers taking the deal. However, a spokesperson for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) told BI the 20,000 number ""isn't current,"" and they're expecting a ""spike"" ahead of the February 6 deadline.

When your wife is out and you’re home alone, most of us, given the first chance, will raid the kitchen, stock up on snacks, and glue ourselves to the TV: lost in an FPS battle of relentless shooting and strategic hiding. A handful of others might call friends for an impromptu beer party. But for a creator, curiosity is the driving force. A free mind nurtures that curiosity, and for a designer – wife away – sparks ideation; just like in the one who envisioned the latest iPhone design.
This iPhone design is not so much about predicting the next Apple move and graphically displaying the ideation. It’s a random thought about what the prized iPhone could be in its bare state – without the cover – if it were not slimy and protruding in places.
Designer: Braz de Pina






Conceived and rendered by Brazilian designer Braz de Pina, who is essentially a Principal Designer at Microsoft, the iPhone Ultra–Vision, as he calls it – is a tantalizing concept that replaces the traditional square camera bump and gives the iPhone a nice grip to hold and use without a rubbery cover. The thought of creating an iPhone that can be used without the case came randomly to the designer one day, he says “I was sitting on my couch … thinking about my phone and its rubbery blue cover. I pondered … why do we buy a beautiful product only to cover it up?”







We all buy the iPhone – besides our loyalty to the Apple ecosystem – for its thin profile, exemplary design, and holistic smartphone experience. But this experience is concealed behind a silicone cover for most of its lifetime in our hands. Addressing this, may be made up – but I think a considerable -challenge, Braz de Pina’s iPhone Ultra has a durable rubber frame. It skips past the idea of thinness and thickens the body so that the camera array at the back can be aligned against the phone surface to eliminate the protruding bump at the back.


While some Android phone OEMs have tested and gone past the idea of a retractable selfie camera, iPhone Ultra thinks it’s an idea worth 2025. The retractable front camera – from images – seems pretty straightforward, but in 2025, maybe if it swivels 360 degrees, some company – if not Apple – may just take the cue. Anyway, the 3D renders describe the concept better than the words can; so, I leave you to check out the images of what a Microsoft designer thinks iPhone could be!

32,2025-02-05,"While Android tablets are undoubtedly powerful and impressive these days, there was a time when buying a premium Android-powered slate meant that you didn’t have to sacrifice size and portability for performance. Fast-forward to today, and Apple’s iPad Mini line has pretty much dominated the premium compact tablet segment, with most Android brands opting to release low-end devices with smaller screen sizes.
That all changes though with Lenovo’s Legion Tab Gen 3 – a performance-packed device under the Legion gaming brand, the Legion Tab 3 provides Android users with a very capable alternative to the iPad Mini with impressive hardware. Powering the tablet is a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, which while not the latest is nevertheless impressive as far as overall performance is concerned. It’s partnered with 12GB of RAM, which these days is enough to run pretty much any game on the Google Play Store, including emulators as well.

READ: The iPad Mini 7 is Proof that We Need Good Compact Android Tablets
By comparison, other small Android tablets on the market right now come with rather basic specs, like Samsung’s Galaxy tab A9, Amazon’s Fire tablet lineup, and even Lenovo’s budget-friendly Tab M series. They’ll be enough for casual daily use, but they’re definitely not meant for performance outside media streaming or casual gaming.
In fact, the Legion Tab Gen 3 has apparently been selling rather well, with Lenovo struggling to keep up with buyer demand after selling out current stocks. With that in mind, some retailers still have kept the tablet in stock, although you have to be diligent when hunting one down.

Other specs include an 8.8-inch LCD display with a sharp 2,560 x 1,600 resolution and a 165Hz refresh rate, with a maximum brightness of 900 nits and slim bezels all around. There’s also a fairly-large 6,550 mAh battery, and connectivity is handled by a pair of USB-C ports for wired tech, in addition to WiFi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4. The tablet also features a 13MP main camera, and an 8MP selfie camera.
If you’re keen on grabbing what is probably the only premium-tier compact Android tablet on the market right now, then you can check it out using this link.

Published onFebruary 6, 2025

Update, February 6, 2025 (10:12 AM ET): ASUS has confirmed to us that the ROG Phone 9 FE will not launch in the US, UK, EU, and some other markets. These markets can opt for the regular ROG Phone 9 or the ROG Phone 9 Pro and Pro Edition models. The ROG Phone 9 FE is specifically for SEA markets like Thailand.
Original article, February 5, 2025 (01:39 AM ET): ASUS launched the ROG Phone 9 series late last year, offering a gaming phone line with a ton of horsepower and plenty of features. What if you want something a little more affordable, though? The company has quietly launched the ROG Phone 9 FE in one market.
ASUS stealthily unveiled the ROG Phone 9 FE in Thailand (h/t: Android Treasure), and it has a lot in common with the ROG Phone 8. Starting with the design, the phone looks very similar to recent ROG devices. The device also has last year’s Anime Vision lighting on the back (featuring 341 LEDs), AirTrigger keys for gaming, and an IP68 rating.
Dive under the hood, and you’ll find an older Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip instead of the brand-new Snapdragon 8 Elite. But this is still a beefy processor backed up by the brand’s GameCool cooling system. That chipset powers a 6.78-inch 185Hz OLED screen (FHD+, Gorilla Glass Victus 2), featuring 2,500 nits of peak brightness and 1,600 nits in high-brightness mode.
The ROG Phone 9 FE has a 5,500mAh battery which is in line with the ROG Phone 8 line but a slight drop from the mainline ROG Phone 9 handsets. Fortunately, you can take advantage of speedy 65W wired charging (USB-PD) or 15W wireless charging.
The camera system also looks like it’s ripped from the vanilla ROG Phone 9 or Indian ROG Phone 8. Thee’s a 50MP main camera (IMX890, gimbal stabilization), a 13MP ultrawide shooter with a free-form lens, and a 5MP macro sensor. Switch to the front and you’ll find a 32MP selfie camera, featuring an RGBW color filter for improved low-light snaps in theory.
Other notable features include a 3.5mm port, Bluetooth 5.4, ROG UI atop Android 15, Wi-Fi 7, and a variety of AI features (e.g. transcription, call translation, wallpaper generation).
The ASUS ROG Phone 9 FE is available in a single 16GB/256GB variant in Thailand and will cost 29,990 baht (~$890). We’ve asked ASUS about a wider release and will update the article when it gets back to us with an answer. We’re not sure how pricing in the US or EU would compare to the standard ROG Phone 9, which retails for $999 and €1,099. It’s also worth noting that the standard ROG Phone 8 can be found at a cheaper price these days."
34,2025-02-05,"The Huawei Mate XT Ultimate made its appearance last year as the world’s first tri-fold phone, and now it’s coming to global markets. The Mate XT Ultimate has drawn quite a bit of attention for its unique design (one that Samsung is likely taking a page from), but until now, it was only available to the Chinese market.
Huawei said it will hold an event in Malaysia on February 18 to introduce the Mate XT Ultimate to the international marketplace. The company did not share pricing details or availability information, but we have less than two weeks until the event.
Be part of the extraordinary as we unveil the ultimate. Join us at #HuaweiLaunch on 18 February 2025, Kuala Lumpur. #UnfoldtheClassic pic.twitter.com/O1RbUrBg9P
&mdash; Huawei Mobile (@HuaweiMobile) February 5, 2025
This announcement comes amid rumors that a successor to the original Huawei Mate XT could be in development. If that rumor is true, it doesn’t necessarily mean you should hold off and wait for a follow-up; it’s likely going to be at least a year or more before the next version of this phone makes its way to the global market, if it happens at all.
The Huawei Mate XT Ultimate costs roughly the equivalent of $2,800 in the Chinese market. We expect a similar price, if the phone comes to the western market. However, the United States government restricted the sale and import of Huawei equipment in 2022, and that ban remains in place today.
As a result, the Mate XT Ultimate might not be available for purchase in the United States. Importing the device is still an option, and it should work with most carriers.
The Huawei Mate XT Ultimate runs on the Kirin 9010 chipset and uses HarmonyOS 4.2. We don’t know exactly what configurations will be offered globally, but in China the Mate XT Ultimate has three options: 256GB with 16GB RAM, 512GB with 16GB RAM, and 1TB with 16GB RAM. It also packs in a triple-camera setup on the rear, boats a fingerprint scanner, and supports up to 66W wired fast charging.
Foldable phones have been around for a little while now. They're still cool, but they're quickly becoming pretty commonplace. Huawei's newest folding phone, however, looks straight out of The Expanse and is barely thicker than the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, despite having two folding hinges instead of one — effectively giving you three regular-sized screens when it's fully opened up.
The Huawei Mate XT is available in China for the equivalent of just under $3,000. Expensive for a phone, yes, but this one is truly unique. The OLED screen can open up to a total of 10.2 inches (the same size as many tablets, for reference) and has an impressive 16:11 aspect ratio.
In a few days, Huawei is set to unveil its first trifold foldable phone, the Mate XT. Several leaks about this phone have surfaced in recent months, and now we have yet another. This latest one includes an introductory video about the handset that offers a closer look at the device.
In the video, which features actor, singer-songwriter, and film producer Andy Lau, you can see the impressive vegan leather back of the phone, which includes an octagon-shaped camera island reminiscent of the one on the previously released Mate 60 RS Ultimate. Lau is a brand ambassador for Huawei's Ultra Design brand. The video's close-up reveals the Mate XT's four cameras, including a periscope module, and its slim profile.
See if you can guess which smartwatch Huawei wants to take on with its latest release. It’s called the Huawei Watch Ultimate, and it’s made to appeal to outdoorsy types, complete with comprehensive diving and expedition modes.
It has a really big screen and a big battery too. That’s right, the Huawei Watch Ultimate is an Apple Watch Ultra competitor — but don’t pass it by just yet, because it’s worth your attention.

by  Zoë Hannah
If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.
If you’re trying to collect all of the Pokémon Squishmallows (insert “gotta catch ‘em all” joke here), today is a good day: Amazon has four squishy li’l guys on sale, including Teddiursa for just over $13.
The 20-inch Fuecoco Squishmallow has the steepest discount at $13 right now, marking the only time I’ve seen the large plush go for less than the 14-inch version, which is on sale for $19.24. In fact, some of us at Polygon are seeing the 20-inch plushie as sold out, depending on our region. But others still see Amazon as listing units in stock, so act fast if you’re interested. The starter from Pokémon Scarlet and Pokémon Violet isn’t the most beloved Pokémon of all time, but it is very cute, especially in this impossibly-soft-and-infinitely-squishy form. Bellibolt is also on a steep discount in both sizes, with the 14-inch plush going for $16.99.
Perhaps most exciting for the old-head Pokémon fans is Clefairy, whose Squishmallow is discounted to $21.66 for the 14-inch plushie.

36,2025-02-05,"Recent sales data from German retailer MindFactory highlights a striking trend in AMD’s Zen 5 CPU lineup, with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D accounting for nearly 90% of all Ryzen 9000-series sales. The latest figures indicate that consumers overwhelmingly prefer this gaming-optimized processor over other models in the lineup.
In January 2025, MindFactory recorded 25,625 total CPU sales, with AMD capturing 92.16% of the market—equivalent to 23,615 units. Intel, by contrast, managed to sell just 2,010 processors, reinforcing AMD’s dominance in the consumer market.
Among the Zen 5 (Ryzen 9000 series) processors, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D saw the highest demand, selling 8,390 units. This makes up a staggering 87% of all Zen 5 CPU sales.
By comparison, the rest of the Ryzen 9000 series saw significantly lower numbers:
Ryzen 7 9700X – 640 units
Ryzen 5 9600X – 250 units
Ryzen 9 9950X – 230 units
Ryzen 9 9900X – 180 units
The X3D lineup has consistently been AMD’s best-selling option for gaming enthusiasts, thanks to its 3D V-Cache technology, which improves performance in CPU-heavy games. Despite selling well above its launch price of $479, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D has become the go-to choice for gamers, while the standard Zen 5 chips have struggled to attract buyers.
With the 9000 series’ non-X3D models failing to gain traction, AMD may need to reassess its product lineup. The continued success of X3D variants suggests that consumers are willing to pay a premium for gaming performance, making it likely that the company may prioritize future X3D models over traditional CPUs.
While MindFactory’s data reflects sales trends in Germany, it serves as a strong indicator of global demand. If these trends continue, AMD could shift its focus toward optimizing X3D chips to sustain its market lead in the high-performance CPU space.
Now more than ever, it's clear that AMD needs to release its 3D V-Cache CPUs alongside each new generation. We've gotten accustomed to AMD rolling out its 3D V-Cache offerings shortly after the release of a new generation, but the crowded lineup is getting too much to bear -- and it's making some of AMD's best processors completely irrelevant.
That becomes obvious as you read my Ryzen 7 9800X3D review. The new CPU is, unsurprisingly, the dominant performer in games, outclassing AMD's last-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D. It also makes improvements in productivity performance, however, so much so that it steps on the toes of an already dense lineup of CPUs from AMD.
A complicated lineup
A screenshot from Gamers Nexus review of the Ryzen 5 5600X3D Gamers Nexus / YouTube
AMD's Zen 5 processors are still fresh out of the oven -- they were only released a little over two months ago. As they struggle to find their footing among some of the best processors, they've been getting discounted regularly ever since, and that certainly helps. Today's deals bring the Ryzen 5 9600X down by nearly $50 when compared to its recommended list price.
The Ryzen 5 9600X is the most budget-friendly chip in the new lineup. It started out with a recommended price (MSRP) of $280, which is $10 less than its predecessor.  That adjustment was nice to see, but the 9600X was still much pricier than the 7600X upon launch, as the Zen 4 chip received numerous price cuts since it first hit the shelves. Right now, it's priced at $225, but I've seen it sell for much less.
We all knew it was coming. A string of rumors over the past several months has pointed to AMD releasing the Ryzen 7 9800X3D on November 7, but the company itself just confirmed the new CPU. It's looking for a spot among the best processors, packing 3D V-Cache on top of an eight-core Zen 5 CPU in order to improve gaming performance.
True to rumors we've seen this week, AMD is pricing the CPU at $479, which is nearly $30 more expensive than the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. AMD claims that the new chip provides an average gaming increase of 8% over the last-gen CPU, and 20% faster gaming performance compared to Intel's recent Core Ultra 9 285K. In addition, AMD says that minimum frame rates are up, with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D improving 1% lows in The Last of Us Part One by 31%.

PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) recently released its Q4 results, with revenues missing and earnings exceeding the street estimates. The company reported revenue of $22.8 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.96 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $27.9 billion and $1.94, respectively. The company continues to face lower volume, while pricing continued to inch higher in Q4. PEP stock, with -9% returns since the beginning of 2024, has underperformed the broader S&P500 index, up 26%. Although PepsiCo posted a mixed quarter, we think its stock has some room for growth from its current levels of around $145. Separately, trade tensions caused volatility. See: What’s Happening With FDX Stock?
PepsiCo’s revenue of $22.8 billion in Q4 reflects a 2% organic growth driven by a 3% rise in pricing, offsetting a 1% decline in volume. Frito-Lay North America and Quaker Foods were the only two segments that saw organic sales decline during the quarter. While international markets showed strength, PepsiCo continued to encounter challenges in the North American market. This aligns with the company’s previous observations that U.S. consumers are exhibiting more cautious spending patterns. PepsiCo reported a 102 bps core operating margin expansion in Q4, bolstering its bottom line, which came in at $1.96, versus $1.78 in the prior-year quarter. Looking forward, PepsiCo expects low single-digit organic revenue growth and mid-single-digit core EPS growth in 2025.
Following its results announcement, PEP stock trended lower. Looking at a slightly longer time frame, the changes in PEP stock over the last four-year period have been far from consistent, although annual returns were considerably less volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 21% in 2021, 7% in 2022, -3% in 2023, and -8% in 2024.
The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and trade wars, could PEP face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2023, and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? While we will soon update our model for PepsiCo to reflect the latest results, we think its stock offers ample room for growth.
At its current levels of $145, PEP stock is trading at under 19x trailing earnings of $8.16 per share, much lower than the stock’s average P/E ratio of 26x over the last five years. Although a modest downward adjustment to the valuation multiple may be warranted to reflect the softer North American market, we believe the current gap is too wide.
While PEP stock looks like it has ample room for growth, it is helpful to see how PepsiCo Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

Researchers at ByteDance, TikTok's parent company, showcased an AI model designed to generate full-body deepfake videos from one image and audio — and the results are scarily impressive.

        ByteDance said that, unlike some deepfake models that can animate only faces or upper bodies, its OmniHuman-1 could generate realistic full-body animations that sync gestures and facial expressions with speech or music.
    

        ByteDance published several dozen test videos, including videos of AI-generated TED Talks and a talking Albert Einstein, on its OmniHuman-lab project page.
    

        In a paper published Monday that has caught the attention of the AI community, ByteDance said the model supported different body proportions and aspect ratios, making the output look more natural.
    

        ""The realism of deepfakes just reached a whole new level with Bytedance's release of OmniHuman-1,"" Matt Groh, an assistant professor at Northwestern University who specializes in computational social science, said in an X post on Tuesday.
    

        OmniHuman-1 is the latest AI model from a Chinese tech company to grab researchers' attention following the release of DeepSeek's market-shaking R1 model last month.
    

        Venky Balasubramanian, the founder and CEO of a tech company called Plivo, said in a Tuesday X post: ""Another week another Chinese AI model. OmniHuman-1 by Bytedance can create highly realistic human videos using only a single image and an audio track.""
    

        ByteDance said its new model, trained on roughly 19,000 hours' worth of human motion data, could create video clips of any length within memory limits and adapt to different input signals.
    

        The researchers said OmniHuman-1 outperformed other animation tools in realism and accuracy benchmarks.
    

        Deepfakes have become harder to detect as the technology has become more sophisticated. Google, Meta, and OpenAI have introduced AI watermarking tools such as SynthID and Meta's Video Seal to flag synthetic content.
    

        While these tools offer some safeguards, they're playing catch-up with the misuse of deepfake technology.
    

        AI-generated videos and voice clones have fueled harassment, fraud, and cyberattacks, with criminals using AI-generated voices to scam victims. US regulators have issued alerts, while lawmakers have introduced legislation to tackle deepfake porn.
    

        A World Economic Forum article last month highlighted how the technology was exposing security flaws.

In this unmissable VR deal, the VIVE XR Elite can be yours for just $800, a $300 saving on its $1100 MSRP.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

If you're in the market for a new VR headset, the HTC VIVE XR Elite is 27% off at HTC's store. We rate it as one of the best VR headsets and we think this is a VR headset deal worth considering.
Originally $1,099.99, the HTC VIVE XR Elite can be yours for just $799.99 from Vive.com. This is also available at Amazon for the same price.
We've called the HTC VIVE XR Elite the best hybrid VR headset thanks to its focus on AR (augmented reality) too. It's a lightweight and portable headset with excellent specs and performance (which we get into below), but its usual price tag makes it prohibitively expensive for most users.
With this discount, however, it's now much more reasonable, making it an absolute bargain given the capabilities of this headset. If you're wanting a VR headset that can also be used for AR, or a super lightweight VR headset, the VIVE XR Elite is well worth considering.
Save $300 on the excellent HTC VIVE XR Elite. It's one of the best VR headsets money can buy: It's lightweight, super powerful and packs in excellent AR functionality, too. 
In terms of specification, the HTC VIVE XR Elite sports a Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 processor, has 12GB RAM and has a combined resolution of 3840 x 1920 pixels. This is a standalone headset, and so while you can connect it to your PC to have access to more games and applications, you can use it completely untethered from anything — being free of cables is a big boon when it comes to VR.
Inside the box of the VIVE XR Elite you'll find the headset, two controllers, a battery cradle, a deluxe headstrap and more. In other words, there's everything you need to use the headset straight out of the box: Simply charge it up and you're ready to go.
Our only concern about the VIVE XR Elite is that it's limited on apps. Unless you connect it to your PC you only have access to the Viveport store, which is limited compared to competing headsets. It also doesn't support connectivity to iPhones, so if you're an Apple user, that's something worth bearing in mind.
Breaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more!
Key features: Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 processor, 12GB RAM, 1920 x 1920 pixels per eye.
Product launched: July 2024
Price history: While the headset is often cheaper than its MSRP, before today's deal it was around the $900 mark. It's now $100 cheaper than that, and it's one of the lowest prices it's been since launch.
Price comparison: Vive: $799.99 | Amazon: $799.99
Reviews consensus: We think it's one of the best VR headsets on the market. While we don't have a review of our own, TechRadar and PC Gamer both have mixed opinions. Both have found it super lightweight and comfortable to wear, making it a pleasure to use, but its high price and lack of software choices stop it from being a top recommendation. Fortunately, the discount helps with one of those issues.
TechRadar: ★★★ | PC Gamer: ★★★½
Featured in guides: Best VR headsets
✅ Buy it if: You want a lightweight headset that's easy to travel with, and something with good AR capabilities.
❌ Don't buy it if: You mainly want to play games. The HTC Vive store is limited, and you'd be much better off investing in a (much cheaper) Meta Quest 3 or 3S.

Asian equities were mixed overnight as the Philippines, Taiwan, and South Korea outperformed, Thailand underperformed, and Pakistan was closed for Kashmir Solidarity Day.
Tariff tit for tat weighed on market sentiment except for metals and mining companies as gold surged, as well as AI plays such as semiconductors, software, and technology hardware, which could also be related to the early success of the new electronic trade in subsidy.
News that the U.S. Postal Service would suspend non-letter parcels from Hong Kong and Mainland China and that an investigation into Shein and Pinduoduo’s Temu would be conducted weighed on sentiment as well. On Wednesday morning, the U.S. Postal Service stated it is not canceling parcel delivery as the Art of the Deal requires some volatility.
Locals resembled traders rather than investors, taking quick profits, including Mainland investors with a rare net sell of -$680 million, mainly the Hong Kong Tracker ETF via Southbound Stock Connect. News that the Chinese government might investigate Apple is a subtle reminder that they have levers that can hurt the U.S. government and, unfortunately, U.S. investors. We have long stated that there are about ~$376 billion of U.S. goods made and sold in China, according to the New York Federal Reserve Bank, that are not by definition “exports” though those revenues and profits flow to the U.S.
The Ministry of Commerce announced it would begin applying export controls of tungsten, bismuth, molybdenum, and bismuth. Regardless, today’s market action clearly indicates nobody wins in a trade war, so hopefully, the two sides can put the kabuki theater aside and meet.
The most ridiculous thing you’ll read is how the Caixin Services PMI “missed” economist expectations as only five firms, of which only two economists submitted estimates. I would start submitting an “expert” estimate for fun if I had the bandwidth. The January release was 51 versus “expert” expectations of 52.4 and December’s 52.2. It was interesting that consumer stocks were off despite early indications that Chinese New Year vacation numbers were robust.
There were some positives with CATL announcing that it would re-list in Hong Kong after the close. The relisting of Mainland companies in Hong Kong could raise China’s weight in MSCI indices. As an FYI, remember that Mainland listed stocks only get 20% of their market cap added to MSCI indices. Premier Li presided over a State Council meeting that generated nothing tangible except for more sound bites, including the statement “a more proactive approach to promote high-quality development and achieve new results.”
By far, the most interesting news today was a report stating the new home price index in 100 cities increased by 0.23% in January, with 47 cities showing month-over-month price increases, 41 MoM price decreases, and 12 unchanged. Year-over-year, 61 cities had an increase, 39 had a decline, and zero were unchanged. For comparison purposes, in September/pre-real estate stimulus measures, 17 cities experienced an increase, and 63 showed a decline in MoM data. The richer the city, the better real estate is doing, as Tier 1 leads the way back. A Mainland media article noted that the ""national ""white list"" project loan approval amount exceeded CNY 5 trillion” with 3.73 million apartments completed. The article specifically mentioned distressed state-owned enterprise developer Vanke, which last Monday was effectively “localized”/taken over by the Shenzhen local government, which completed 180,000 apartments. If Xi and Trump can do a trade deal, I suspect a major real estate stimulus could occur. Hopefully, they get to it.

Today, in the Real Estate Newsletter: Asking Rents Mostly Unchanged Year-over-year
Brief excerpt: Another monthly update on rents.

The outlook among executives in Germany's key automotive industry has continued to sour, according to the latest results of a monthly industry survey from the ifo Institute released on Wednesday.
Ifo's monthly index for the auto industry, which is based on the results of a survey of businesses in the sector, plummeted in January to a new low of negative 40.7, down a further 5.7 points from December.
""The automotive industry is stuck in crisis. Above all, it sees its competitive position in serious jeopardy,"" said ifo Institute automotive expert Anita Wölfl.
According to the survey, companies rated their position on foreign markets as lower than ever before, both within the European Union and globally.
According to ifo, German carmakers have also lost significant ground on the German domestic market to foreign rivals.
""The strong competition from China, [US President Donald] Trump's threats to impose tariffs on US imports from the EU in the near future and burdens at home are putting considerable pressure on the German automotive industry,"" said Wölfl.

44,2025-02-05,"The market for luxury two-seaters is limited, something Buick discovered upon the introduction of the Reatta in the late 1980s. Let’s see if today’s Nice Price or No Dice convertible survivor fares better in the modern era.
Wow, we are feeling spicy this week. That proved obvious from the comments on yesterday’s funky 1991 Citroën BX 19 TZi. While the seller claimed to have been enjoying the never-sold-here private import as a daily driver without major issue, many of you felt the next owner wouldn’t likely be as lucky, and a $7,500 price tag meant a too onerous asking for such a risky roll of the dice. Ultimately, the Citroën ended up with a narrow turn-down in a 54 percent No Dice defeat.
Around the same time Citroën was bringing Marcello Gandini to the masses with the BX, Buick was going the exclusive route with a home-styled halo car for a small clutch of discriminating car buyers. The result was the Reatta, a truncated two-seater based on the Riviera and cousin to the similarly positioned Cadillac Allanté.
The name Reatta sounds like regatta, which conjures up images of the car paired with a sleek sailing boat and blasting yacht rock. However, according to those in the know, the name derives from the 1950s James Dean movie Giant, in which the ranch was dubbed Reata, or Spanish for lariat. GM marketers added an extra “t” for good measure.
Originally debuting as a coupe for the 1988 model year, the Reatta gained a convertible version two years later. The reasons for the delay were twofold. Engineers first had to figure out how to make the body structurally sound enough without a roof. They also had to figure out an innovative way for the fabric top to fold when raising and lowering, as, unlike most other convertible tops that sit inside the body’s lines, the Reatta’s fits flush with the fenders.
For the former issue, Buick was only partially successful. The Reatta being hand-built meant significant variations in NVH in cars coming off the line. This was to such an extent that Buick allocated only the best-testing cars for public sale while offering those that didn’t cut the mustard to employees at a substantial discount. The second engineering feat was more of a win as the Reatta convertible’s top does some fancy sideways contractions when lowering to fit the body lines. It’s sort of like those ’90s IBM laptops with the keyboards that slid out sideways!
This 1990 Reatta convertible looks to be in excellent condition. These were only offered in the 1990 and ’91 model years as Buick pulled the plug on the Reatta as a whole after that. As such, it features a driver’s side airbag and a redesigned dashboard that ditches the fun but flaky touchscreen display for more traditional and more likely-to-work mechanical button controls.
Buick offered the Reatta with a single drivetrain, comprised of the company’s stout 3.8-liter pushrod V6 with fuel injection matched with a four-speed automatic. This combo drives the front wheels and is paired with ABS disc brakes all the way around. 
With just 170 horsepower and 220 lb-ft of torque to work with, the 3,400-pound convertible isn’t going to win any races, but it should be OK for drama-free day-to-day driving, which is what it was designed for.
According to the ad, this Reatta has done 84,848 miles of driving and comes with a clean title. The latter attribute is noteworthy since the car is being offered by a shop that apparently has both whole cars for sale and a yard of junkers in case one needs only a part.
Painted in red over a biscuit leather and vinyl interior and wearing a nice set of factory five-spokes, this car seems to be a solid survivor. The seller says it’s “Ready to go” and claims it to be “Nice!” According to the Reatta Owners Club, these are under-appreciated classics that one day will see their due. We’ll now need to decide if this one is worth its $5,595 asking to wait out that eventuality.
What do you think? Is this Reatta worth $5,595 as it sits? Or is that too much for a car that was never very popular to begin with?
You decide!

48,2025-02-05,"The United States Postal Service early on Wednesday said it would resume accepting packages from China and Hong Kong, reversing a brief hours-long freeze. 
In a statement, the Postal Service said it is working with Customs and Border Protection to implement an “efficient collection mechanism” for President Donald Trump’s new tariffs, which have evolved into a burgeoning trade war with Beijing. 
The temporary move came several hours after Trump’s new duties of 10% on Chinese exports to the U.S. took effect. China hit back with its own proposed tariffs, which begin next week, export controls related to critical minerals, and a series of targeted actions at companies including Google (GOOGL). 
The suspension was expected to hurt Chinese e-commerce companies, several of which have a growing presence in the U.S. despite making most of their money in the domestic market. American depositary receipts of Chinese retail giant Alibaba (BABA) fell by more than 2% in early trading on Wednesday.
 Rival Punduoduo’s stock was down 7% ahead of the market open, while JD.com (JD) stock sank 2%. Amazon (AMZN) stock also fell 1% in pre-market trading Wednesday, as its reliance on Chinese-based sellers may become a liability.
“China-based sellers account for significant portions of our third-party seller services and advertising revenues, and China-based suppliers provide significant portions of our components and finished goods,” Amazon noted in its 2023 annual report, adding that geopolitical and other events affecting those groups could impact its operating results. The company reports full-year earnings for 2024 on Thursday. 
 Trump’s orders also closed the de minimis exemption, a key loophole used by e-retailers such as Temu and Shein to keep prices down. The law allows for packages valued at less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free as long as they are packaged and addressed to individual buyers.
According to Customs and Border Protection, more than 1.36 billion shipments entered the U.S. claiming the de minimus exemption. In 2015, just 139 million shipments claimed the exemption.
Shipments from China and Hong Kong accounted for roughly a third of U.S. de minimis imports in 2023, according to a Congressional Revenue Service analysis published last month. In 2022, more than 80% of U.S. e-commerce imports were de minimis shipments, according to the International Trade Commission.
Pinduodo’s Temu (PDD) was on track to reach $30 billion in sales under its strategy to offer cheap goods in exchange for longer delivery times, although the new actions will likely be a setback. Amazon Haul, an ultra-cheap platform designed by Amazon to compete with Temu and Shein, directly ships products to U.S. consumers directly from China. With the new tariffs, such companies’ reliance on low-cost, individual shipments from China is likely to become more expensive.

50,2025-02-05,"CHONGQING, CHINA - JANUARY 18: Performers wearing elaborate traditional Chinese headdresses and ... [+] costumes participate in a cultural event at Jiefangbei on January 18, 2025 in Chongqing, China. (Photo by Cheng Xin/Getty Images)
Estée Lauder (NYSE: EL) recently released its Q2 fiscal 2025 results (fiscal ends in June), with revenues and earnings exceeding the street estimates. It reported sales of $4.0 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.62 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $4.0 billion and $0.32, respectively.
The company has been struggling with falling sales and profits lately, amid weakness in China. This has reflected in its stock as well, which plunged 51% since the beginning of 2024, significantly underperforming the broader S&P500 index, up 27%. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.
Estée Lauder’s revenue of $4.0 billion in Q2 was down 6% y-o-y. Looking at segments, the company reported a 12% fall in Skin Care sales, 8% decline in Hair Care, 1% drop in Makeup sales, and the Fragrance revenues were up 1%. Looking at sales by geography, EMEA was down 6%, Americas was down 2%, and Asia Pacific down 11%. The decline in the EMEA region can be attributed to lower sales for the company’s global travel retail business. A continued decline in mainland China demand weighed on overall Asia Pacific sales.
The company reported an adjusted operating margin of 11.5% in Q2’25, reflecting a 200 bps fall y-o-y. The adjusted EPS stood at $0.62, vs. $0.88 in the prior-year quarter. Looking forward, Estée Lauder expects its Q3 sales to fall around 9% and earnings to plunge 75% y-o-y to around $0.25 per share, at the mid-point of the provided range.
While the company reported Q2 better than the street estimates, its bleak Q3 outlook didn’t sit well with the investors, resulting in a sharp 16% fall in EL stock post the results announcement. Even if we look at a slightly longer timeframe, the changes in EL stock over the recent years have been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500.
In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Considering the current uncertain macroeconomic climate characterized by fluctuating interest rates and persistent trade tensions, will Estée Lauder continue to experience a downturn, or is a recovery imminent? We estimate Estée Lauder’s Valuation to be $78 per share, reflecting around 20% upside from its current levels of $65.
EL stock has enjoyed higher valuation multiples in recent years, with its average P/S ratio of 5.1x over the last five years. However, at its current levels of around $65, EL stock is trading at 1.5x trailing revenues. With falling sales and profitability and trends in China prestige beauty demand, we think the valuation multiple will likely remain lower in the near term.
While EL stock looks like it has little room for growth, it is helpful to see how Estée Lauder’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

51,2025-02-05,"LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY - JANUARY 5: A FedEx Corp. semi trucks sits parked in the snow at Louisville ... [+] Muhammad Ali International Airport on January 5, 2025 in Louisville, Kentucky. (Photo by Luke Sharrett/Getty Images)
FedEx stock (NYSE: FDX) dropped 7% on February 3 amid concerns over new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and China impacting logistics demand. While the tariffs were temporarily suspended for one month, the uncertainty may continue affecting delivery companies’ outlook. As an aside, is there room for growth? See: Should You Pick PEP Stock At $145?
Looking at a slightly longer period, FDX stock is up 49% since the beginning of 2023. This can be attributed to a solid 81% rise in the company’s P/E ratio from 8.1x trailing earnings to 14.6x now, partly offset by an 18% fall in earnings per share. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.
FedEx experienced a notable financial downturn, with earnings suffering from both revenue decline and margin compression. FedEx’s revenue fell by 7% from $93.5 billion in 2022 to $87.4 billion in the trailing twelve months. This decline stems from several factors: decreased e-commerce activity post-pandemic peak, ongoing inflationary pressures, and weakened international shipping demand.
Profitability metrics also deteriorated during this period. The operating margin contracted by 30 basis points, falling from 7.0% to 6.7%. More significantly, the adjusted net income margin saw a steeper decline of 110 basis points, representing a 19% drop. The combined impact of lower revenue and compressed margins led to earnings per share decreasing from $20.61 in 2022 to $16.92 in the most recent twelve-month period.
Despite the weak financial performance, investors have assigned a higher valuation multiple for FDX stock. This can partly be attributed to the company’s plans to separate its freight division through a spin-off, a strategic move that investors have been anticipating. The separation allows FedEx to sharpen its focus on its core package delivery operations while potentially enhancing overall profitability. This strategic restructuring is expected to create additional value for shareholders.
Now, as trade tensions loom with possible new tariffs, what can investors expect from FedEx stock? We currently estimate FedEx’s Valuation to be $315 per share, reflecting over 25% upside from here. FedEx stock’s elevated valuation multiple appears warranted, given the expected rise in profitability. For perspective, FedEx is expected to see its revenue rise around 5% over the next two years, but its earnings are estimated to surge over 28% during this period.
While trade conflicts could dampen growth prospects, FedEx’s operational improvements position it well for enhanced profitability. But, if you are looking for less volatility, consider the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, which has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
While FDX stock looks like it has ample room for growth, it is helpful to see how FedEx’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

It was the early '70s, and Paul and Patricia Grogan were looking for a new home.

        The couple, who met in college in the '60s, lived in a cozy family house in an outer suburb of Dublin back then but dreamed of building one on their own.
    

        ""We suddenly thought we'd love to maybe strike out and be a bit adventurous. So we started looking for sites,"" Patricia, 81, a former teacher and retired special needs assistant, told Business Insider.
    

        They stumbled upon a stunning plot in Kilcroney, a small town about 30 minutes outside Dublin. It was slightly over an acre, with a stream running through it, and offered views of a small mountain nearby.
    

        ""It was a forest and there were grass and trees and weeds growing up to it. You couldn't get into it actually,"" Patricia said. ""But it was a beautiful spot.""
    

        The couple knew that they had found the perfect place to settle down. But before any construction could take place, the couple had to clear the site.
    

        ""We spent many happy picnics with friends out here clearing the site,"" she said. ""And we had to take out a few trees in order to have room to build the house.""
    

Living in Ireland, where the skies are often cloudy, they wanted their house to let in as much natural light as possible. They also wanted to be able to enjoy the views of the surrounding natural landscape.
    

        Their architect helped them design thehouse, which is a four-bedroom, two-bathroom, greenhouse-like structure with a fully glazed front.
    

        ""I suppose we liked the idea of being able to see things out of the house — just like our previous house,"" Paul, 81, who does consulting work for the design and maintenance of database systems, told BI, ""There was glass all around the courtyard, where we had a little garden with bamboo growing in it.""
    

        The glass front turned their house into a passive solar home, which meant that it could collect and retain heat from the sun to warm its interiors, thereby reducing their energy consumption, he said.
    

        Be it earthen homes that keep cool in the summer or resilient towns that can survive a category-four hurricane, there has been a growing interest in sustainable houses in the face of rising temperatures and the climate crisis.
    

        But in 1976, the year they built their house, it wasn't common to think about houses that way, Paul said.
    

        ""It was unusual at the time to have such a system, and it works pretty well. We do have to provide supplementary heat on very cold, wet days, though,"" he said, adding that they have a few radiators and a wood fire stove on the first floor.
    

        During the summer, when the temperatures are slightly higher, the couple opens all the sliding doors on the glass front of the house, he said.
    

        It's the only house in their neighborhood that's designed this way, he said.
    

        Paul added the house has a building energy rating of C1 — which is on par with houses built in the country since the year 2000. In comparison, most houses in Ireland built before the 1980s typically achieve a low D or E in terms of energy ratings.
    

        ""So heating costs would be lower than most of the Irish housing stock,"" he said.
    

        It helps that the property is surrounded by trees that offer some shade during sunny days.
    

        ""If we feel the heat is getting too much, we can open the windows upstairs and get a draft down through that,"" he said.
    

        It took less than eight months for their house to be built, Patricia said.
    

        Their friends came out to help them with tasks like painting the beams, she said: ""We've done nothing to them since. They've just got a nice mellow color now.""
    

        The couple says they spent about 35,000 Irish pounds to build the house back then. The Irish pound was replaced by the euro in January 1999.
    

        ""It wasn't a very expensive house to build. We were surprised, but that's because of probably the simplicity of the construction and the bit of work we all put in to help keep the cost down,"" Paul said. ""But that was 1976, and things were cheaper then, too.""
    

        When they bought the plot of land, the couple had three kids, but by the time they moved into the house, they had four.
    

        ""We got a surprise pregnancy, and it was quite stressful at the time, but we did it,"" Patricia said.
    

        Every nook and cranny of the house is filled with beautiful memories, Paul said.
    

        ""It's been a very happy house for bringing up the children. They all loved the fact that there's plenty of wildlife around here and in the forest,"" he said.
    

        They've kept dogs, cats, and hens throughout the years. At one point in time, they even had ponies, too, Patricia said.
    

        Her favorite spot in the house is her office on the second floor.
    

        ""Somebody came out here recently and said, 'I don't know how you managed to do any work here. Just looking out in the garden is lovely,"" she said.
    

        Paul's favorite spot in the house is the kitchen because ""that's where everybody congregates."" It overlooks the garden, and it's where they've had many ""wonderful parties,"" he said.
    

        When the couple first moved in, there were only two or three neighbors. But over the years, the community has expanded to include about 17 houses, each on about an acre or more of land, Paul said.
    

        ""And we're all in the same WhatsApp group. So if anything happens in the area, everybody's on,"" he said.
    

        There's a walking trail that runs along the area and into the forest that the couple and a few neighbors have cultivated and maintained over the years.
    

        ""We encourage all the neighbors or their children to walk around the area, which means we all meet one another fairly regularly as they're passing by,"" Paul said.
    

        It's a close-knit community where everyone looks out for each other.
    

        ""In fact, we have a long drive — it's about 500 meters from the house down to the road. When we leave our bins out, we have to bring them down to the end of the drive. But our next-door neighbors, when they're going for a walk, they'll pick up our bins and bring them up to the house,"" he said.
    

        At the moment, only the two of them live in the house; their four daughters are all grown up, and three of them live in London.
    

        ""We've grown into it. We've taken over, we've spread ourselves out,"" Patricia said.
    

        However, maintaining a house and garden of this size takes a lot of work. As they're getting older, they've decided to list the house on the market for 1.275 million euros, or about $1.32 million.
    

        ""I spent a lot of time in the garden, which I really loved. But I'm just coming to the point now where I'd like to do some other things in my life besides gardening,"" Patricia said, with a laugh.
    

        Their plan is to move into a smaller place closer to Dublin, where it's easier to get around.
    

        ""We both still drive but would like to use more public transport, which is free for pensioners in Ireland,"" Paul said
    

        They'll be sad to leave their neighbors, he added.
    

        While their eldest daughter considered buying the house a few years ago, Patricia says she knows the house requires ""a big commitment.""
    

        The property is about 40 minutes from the Dublin airport and about 15 minutes from the coast, making it a great place to live, especially for those who can work from home — like he does, he added.
    

        In fact, working from home was a major factor in his decision to continue working beyond the normal retirement age.
    

        ""I love my work, the mental challenges it presents, and the ongoing relationships with my clients,"" Paul said. ""I may slow down a little, but love the stimulus of problem-solving and ongoing study of new technology my work provides.""
    

        ""The trees, we think, have kept the place, the air, and us very, very healthy,"" Patricia said. ""We feel the trees have looked after us, and they're very big now, but definitely they've looked after us.""
    

        In many ways, it's been a home that has grown with them.
    

        ""We were excited at the beginning about just doing something very different, but it's been a very happy place for the family,"" Paul said.
    

        One thing's for sure, Paul said: ""There'll be a lot of tears when we leave this place.""

HANNAH BATES: Welcome to HBR On Strategy, case studies and conversations with the world’s top business and management experts, hand-selected to help you unlock new ways of doing business.
It’s essentially a holy grail for many businesses—identifying sustainable competitive advantage. But Chris Zook points out that it’s elusive for most companies. He notes that, on average, less than one in 10 achieve profitable growth over the course of a decade.
Zook is the former head of Bain’s global strategy practice. He’s also coauthor of the book Repeatability: Build Enduring Businesses for a World of Constant Change.
In this episode, he shares three key principles that can help your organization find and maintain an enduring competitive advantage—with real world examples drawn from IKEA, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, and Nike.
This episode originally aired on HBR IdeaCast in March 2012 . And just a note—we recorded this by phone. While the audio quality is not great, the conversation is. I think you’ll enjoy it. Here it is.
SARAH GREEN: Welcome to the HBR IdeaCast from Harvard Business Review. I’m Sarah Green. I’m talking today with Chris Zook, a partner at Bain & Company, and co-head head of their strategy practice. He’s the co-author, with James Allen, of Repeatability: Build Enduring Businesses for a World of Constant Change. Chris, thanks so much for chatting with us.
CHRIS ZOOK: Oh, thank you very much.
SARAH GREEN: So part of what drew me to your idea is that, while you talk about this world of constant change, which sounds exciting and exhausting at the same time, your strategic prescription for companies is actually to focus on simplicity and to fight against complexity. Is that realistic in today’s world?
CHRIS ZOOK: Well, it’s quite interesting. The work in the book Repeatability was really borne of a paradox that we began observing, which was that from a database, we created about 8,000 businesses in the last 25 to 30 years at Bain & Company. We found that only now less than 1 in 10 companies achieve even a modest level of sustained and profitable growth over a 10-year period on average. And yet, the paradox comes in collision with a very interesting additional fact, which is that 9 in 10 executives nearly, when surveyed, say that they actually feel they face adequate opportunities in their business.
And yet, the reality is that only 1 in 10 actually succeed in achieving the targets. And when we began drilling down into this in what turned out to be about a three-year project on the root cause of more enduring competitive advantage in a world where it seemed shorter, we asked 377 executives what was the number one barrier to achieving their goals. And 85% of them answer it in a way that was related to the broad theme of complexity. They either felt it was becoming more difficult to react to an increasingly fast world in businesses that are more complex and more muscle-bound, or to see and perceive what they need to react to or internally to decide, and to mobilize, or to focus resources for a long enough period of time. But we were fascinated that it was not being in the wrong market, some amazing competitor move, some technology that they coveted but did not have that served as their main barrier. They actually cited, over and over again, this topic of complexity.
SARAH GREEN: So in your view, complexity– rising complexity– is not just like a bad weather system that’s moving through and we have to deal with it. It’s something that can actually be managed with the right strategic approach?
CHRIS ZOOK: Yeah, I think that the clash of complexity and speed, maybe several decades ago, was a world of long periods, of more calm, punctuated by brief periods of turbulence when those two things come into conflict. I think we’re now finding that, in a separate piece of work we did, for example, that we called “The CEO’s Agenda,” we asked CEOs what was their number one issue in their job.
And they actually said– and we’d never heard this before– they overwhelmingly said it was managing their time and energy in the face of growing complexity. And when we probed further, it was really a sense that the world is moving faster. I just came from Davos. In one talk after another, I would hear economists, and historians, and even the leader of the forum say that it was almost as if history was happening faster.
History is happening at warp speed. Product cycle times are shorter. Companies stay in their position for shorter times. There’s more you have to react to. And yet, institutions– whether government institutions or businesses– are more complex and slower moving, and therefore less adaptable. And I think adaptability is becoming much more a headline in the success factors of businesses than it used to be. A general direction and adaptability is proving to be one key element of success factors.
SARAH GREEN: Yeah. So that’s a little bit about the current moment we’re in. But of course, the idea of looking for a sustainable source of competitive advantage has been the holy grail for business for a long time. As you say, it’s about as common as a holy grail since no 1 in 10 of the companies in your study actually get to something like that. So how does Repeatability help companies get closer?
CHRIS ZOOK: Well, we began looking a lot more closely at the drivers of enduring success because we found many, many companies– a very large percentage– would have two, or three, or even four good years. But not very many, only 1 in 10, would achieve that on average for 10. And when you got to 15, the odds of success went down even more.
And so we began a process of interviewing CEOs, and executives, and building another database of about 200 companies with a lot of their practices and characteristics of their strategies in search of what we call the design principles of enduring strategies. And what we found were three design principles that, when all three were adhered to at a very high level, resulted in businesses, on average, being able to have as much as five to six times longer duration of maintaining competitive advantage. And all three of them we’re actually related, in some way, to the theme of simplicity. What we found– I guess the headline, in a way, for the whole study– is the idea that complexity proved to be the silent killer of profitable growth.
SARAH GREEN: Hm. So can you walk us through some of those principles quickly?
CHRIS ZOOK: Sure. The first one is much more borne of classical strategy. It is really the presence of an extremely clear form of differentiation in your most important core business, uniqueness against your competitors so that it just really jumps out at you and hits you in the face. An example of this might be, let’s say, Ikea, the furniture retailer which has outgrown its market by 2 and 1/2 times for over 25 years.
And it’s amazing. When you ask the people in the company whether it’s a front line or whether it’s senior executive of how Ikea is special, they all rattle off a very clear and very crisp set of factors, from the self-assembly, to the layout, and color, and branding of the store, to how they design to a price point. So the first of the three principles of the great repeatable models is what we called a well-defined, clear, measurable differentiation literally that everyone in your company can understand. You can hear this and say, well, of course that’s true. But it’s quite amazing.
We did some work on differentiation where we asked a whole lot of customers and then their suppliers of a range of products, from cellphones to rental cars, how differentiated they felt the product that they were consuming was. And only 8% of customers for this set of products said that they thought it was very differentiated and unique, versus 80% of the suppliers. And we called this difference the delivery gap or the differentiation gap. And it’s amazing.
In my role as head of strategy practice at Bain, I very often walk into client situations with my partners. And we find that, actually, the management team has assumed they know what their core differentiation is, but actually haven’t discussed it in years. It’s almost like a couple that may not, for 10 years, have discussed the essence of the relationship. And suddenly, they wake up and discover that they’re on different planets.
SARAH GREEN: OK. So that’s the first one. Tell us a little bit about the other two.
CHRIS ZOOK: The way I would characterize the second design principle is the absolute ability to hard wire the key four, five, or six principles or ideas of the strategy. So just think of the Ikea example, all the way through the organization into front line routines using a small number of principles and beliefs that we’ve been calling the non-negotiables. And so the existence of these non-negotiables in a company and their use in driving the strategy, almost like the operating manual, a strategy to the front line, was the second design principle.
A simple and great example is Vanguard, the company which, during the financial crisis, amazingly captured 40% of all the free money circulating in the United States. And it’s very interesting. If you talk to the phone operators or the CEO at Vanguard, they will speak in almost identical words about the key principles that define how the company operates from a belief and loyalty to the small investor such that they will even turn down money from others that they feel are hot money to the concept that you can’t beat the market in the long run, which caused them to favor and ultimately really develop the science of indexed funds. And so that would be a second one.
And again, you can hear this and say, well, of course. Isn’t this how strategies get done? But actually, companies layer in so much complexity that very often, the wiring, the signal from the top to the front line, just doesn’t really occur. We got hold of some data on 300,000 employees from hundreds of employee surveys of companies. And what we found is that in only about 40% of the cases did the average employee in the average company– not even the worst company– say that they had any idea about what the strategy and its key objectives were. And imagine if you had a marching band or a football team where only 40% of the people had an idea of what the game plan was. You’d have chaos.
So that’s the second design principle. It’s the ability to drive through a few ideas, the non-negotiables, all the way to the front line. I think that’s becoming a much more important test of strategy in a world where the CEOs are getting drawn farther from the front line.
SARAH GREEN: So what’s the final one? What’s the third one?
CHRIS ZOOK: The final one has proved, actually, to be the most difficult on average for companies to do. But as we observe companies around the world– and even as we observe our own mix of business at Bain working for clients– we’re seeing a much more intense focus on this third design principle, which is about feedback loops and systems for learning around the four or five absolutely most important variables of the strategy that are really highlighted, that link to people’s pay perhaps, that are not necessarily financial measures.
But they may be measures of customer loyalty. They may be measures of products working correctly the first time in the field. But we found that the ability to turn learning and continuous improvement into a competitive advantage was much more profound in the great repeatable model companies, like Ikea, or Vanguard, or maybe Enterprise Rent-A-Car. Enterprise is an interesting example of this because they’re the largest hirer of college graduates now in America, amazingly, and the second largest fleet next to the post office in America an and have outgrown, by a factor of two, the rental car market for nearly 20 years.
And if you talk to Andy Taylor, Jr., the son of the founder and CEO, until recently, he says that basically the whole company is built around one measurement, one feedback number, which they call ESQI. It’s a customer loyalty measure of, would you come back or not? And they actually rank order every single one of 8,000 branches every week, publish the data. And if you’re in the bottom section of that group, there are no promotions and no bonuses. And as a result, the learning of the lower group goes up very fast because they share practices, and they study assiduously the ones that are at the top. And it’s become an enormously powerful source of competitive advantage.
So the first is the differentiation, the first design principle, clarity of it, simplicity of it. The second is the ability to translate into non-negotiable principles and push it down to shorten the distance from the CEO to the front line. And the third is a few really super-ordinately important and powerful learning systems that everyone knows about and serves, in a way, as a measure of the health and robustness of the core itself.
SARAH GREEN: One of the interesting pairings I think that you talk about in the book to illustrate those three principles was comparing Nike versus Reebok. What did you learn from that contrast?
CHRIS ZOOK: It’s so interesting sometimes to go back and follow the history of two companies, in this case Nike and Reebok, that started– at least in a moment in time– in remarkably similar circumstances. Around 1990, they were both 100% athletic footwear, rubber-soled sneakers. They were approximately the same size. The brands were approximately equally known. And they were both approximately similarly profitable.
And yet, along the way, Nike developed a repeatable model around a few very simple and clear forms of differentiation to do with performance, and design of materials, and the brand, and their supply chain to Asia, and above all being superb at signing contracts with top athletes of the world, like Roger Federer. Whereas by contrast, Reebok wandered around, following what turned out to be a pattern of no pattern, really, and wandered into everything, began seeing themself for a while as the general shoe company, and wandered into Western boots, rock port walking shoes.
Those were not successful. They exited. They tried fashion for a while and had joint ventures with Ralph Lauren in fashion, which were not that successful. They went back to performance, but were a bit late to copy Nike and came out with a range of products, like the pump, which were not that successful. And they wandered around for nearly 20 years in the twilight of marginal economics, where actually the stock price is almost completely flat for 18 years until they were purchased by Adidas, the German competitor to Nike.
And I think what this said is, if you are a company, and you have a competitor, and you’re able– just like maybe Walmart versus Kmart would be another example. There’s a lot of examples. General Motors versus Toyota would be another. And you have a well-defined, repeatable model that adheres to these design principles, you drive learning much more quickly. You have your resources much more focused. And the probability of your growth bets, like going into a new segment for Nike, is much, much higher. A Nike’s odds of success from going into cycling, or tennis, or running, or football, or golf, or volleyball, or one segment after another, has been extremely high product after product because of their repeatable formula to do it, whereas the success rate of the typical growth move is 20%.
And for Reebok, it was much lower than that. So I think the Nike/Reebok contrast attests to the power of focus, a power of the design principles of repeatable models, and above all, the competitive power. If you are doing it and your competitor isn’t, you– in a relatively quick time– can be in a position of game, set, and match.
SARAH GREEN: Hm. Well, Chris, that’s good advice. And I know there’s a lot more of it in the book. Thanks again for sharing some of your time with us today.

Merck (NYSE: MRK) recently released its Q4 results, with revenues and earnings exceeding the street estimates. The company reported revenue of $15.6 billion and adjusted earnings of $1.72 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $15.5 billion and $1.62, respectively. The company continued to benefit from increasing sales of Keytruda. However, Merck’s outlook for 2025 fell short of expectations, weighing on its stock. As an aside, ready for a rebound? See: Should You Pick PFE Stock At $25? 
MRK stock, with -14% returns since the beginning of 2024, has underperformed the S&P 500 index, up 27%. Merck’s HPV vaccine – Gardasil – is facing a challenge in China amid lower demand. The decline in Gardasil sales, clubbed with increased competition for its diabetes drugs, has weighed on the company’s stock lately. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.
Merck’s revenue of $15.6 billion in Q4 was up 7% y-o-y, driven by continued market share gains for Keytruda, which saw a 19% y-o-y jump in sales to $7.8 billion. Merck’s new drugs – Winrevair and Capvaxive – have been gaining momentum. On the flip side, Gardasil sales fell 17% to $1.55 billion, due to a continued decline in China. Januvia and Janumet also saw a sharp 38% y-o-y decline amid increased competition. Merck announced that it has paused the Gardasil shipments to China, aimed at expediting the clearance of excess inventory and enhancing the financial stability of its Chinese partner.
Merck saw its adjusted gross margin expand by 220 bps to 75.5% due to a favorable product mix. Merck’s bottom line stood at $1.72, and it includes a one-time charge of $0.23 per share for transactions related to business developments. The $1.72 figure is much better than the $0.03 the company reported in the prior-year quarter.
Looking forward, Merck expects its sales to be between $64.1 billion to $65.6 billion and adjusted earnings to be in the range of $8.88 and $9.03. Both metrics were below the street estimates of $67.4 billion and $9.21, respectively. The outlook takes into account lower Gardasil sales, as the shipments to China are paused through at least mid-year.
Although Merck reported upbeat results, the outlook did not sit well with the investors, and the stock tanked 9% post the results announcement. Even if we look at a slightly longer timeframe, the changes in MRK stock over the recent years have been far from consistent and have largely been as volatile as the S&P 500.
In contrast. the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and changes in the White House, could MRK face a similar situation as it did in 2021, 2023 and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a strong jump? While we will soon update our model for Merck to reflect the latest results, its stock seems to have some room for growth. At its current levels of around $90, MRK stock is trading at under 12x its trailing earnings of $7.65 per share, lower than the stock’s historical average P/E of around 14x.
Considering the substantial growth trajectory of Keytruda and the robust earnings growth projections, we believe a higher valuation multiple for Merck is warranted. Furthermore, the company’s recent strategic acquisitions, including Prometheus, Acceleron, Imago, Harpoon Therapeutics, and EyeBio, are poised to enhance both revenue and earnings growth in the foreseeable future.

US stocks recovered from losses on Wednesday to close higher on the day. Earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, but Big Tech got a boost from a jump in Nvidia (NVDA) shares.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the gains, rising 0.7%, or more than 300 points.
Alphabet's stock was under pressure, down nearly 7%, after fourth quarter cloud revenue undershot estimates. The miss rattled investors concerned that the Google parent's hefty spending on AI won't see the hoped-for payoff any time soon.
Nvidia appears to be one potential beneficiary from that spending, however. It helped lead the major indexes' charge back from the red, rising more than 5%.
Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell nine basis points to hit 4.42%, its lowest level since December 2024.
AMD's earnings provided another salvo in mixed sentiments around the AI trade. While the chipmaker posted a quarterly revenue beat, a disappointing data-center sales forecast raised worries about a loss of AI momentum. AMD shares tumbled over 6%.
Big Tech names like Alphabet are also getting caught up in the tariff tit-for-tat between the US and China, which Wall Street sees as a risk for tech and chip names alike. Apple (AAPL) shares dropped about 2% before recovering after a Bloomberg report that Beijing is looking into targeting its app store in an antitrust probe.
President Donald Trump's tariff plans have markets already jumpy, and his unexpected suggestion late Tuesday that the US could take over the Gaza strip and develop it as a ""Riviera of the Middle East"" left investors even more bemused about which direction policy will take next.
Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports:
Ford (F) reported a fourth quarter earnings and revenue beat, with full-year profit coming in slightly higher than expected, but the company issued muted full-year guidance. The results come after rival GM (GM) reported strong results but declined to return more cash to shareholders.
Ford said it sees full-year 2025 adjusted EBIT of $7.0 billion to $8.5 billion, and $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow. Ford said the guidance ""presumes headwinds related to market factors,"" such as pricing, though that does not include changes in policy like the potential loss of EV tax credits or tariffs. CFO Sherry House added in a call with reporters that a 25% tariff on imports ""would have a major impact on our industry.""
Shares were down nearly 5% after hours following the release. Read more here.
The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell 9 basis points to hit 4.42%, its lowest level since December 2024, on Wednesday.
interest rate sensitive areas of the market rallied in reaction. Real Estate (XLRE) led the sector action on Wednesday, rising nearly 1.6%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 index (^RUT), which had come under pressure as bond yields rose, added nearly 1% on the day.
MicroStrategy (MSTR) announced a splashy rebrand Wednesday that underscored its commitment to its cryptocurrency strategy.
The company said it will now do business under the name Strategy and changed its logo to a bitcoin symbol. In its announcement, Strategy said it is ""the world’s first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company.""
Shares of the company were down about 2% on Wednesday and were little changed after the midday announcement. Year to date, the stock is up 17% against bitcoin's more modest 1% gain.
Once a small software firm, MicroStrategy is now the world’s largest bitcoin holding company, and its spending spree on the cryptocurrency has seen the stock outperform bitcoin handily over the last five years.

Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports:
Federal Reserve officials appear to have a unified message this week on the question of how they are reacting to President Donald Trump’s new tariffs.
Fed vice chair Philip Jefferson said, ""I do not think we need to be in a hurry to change our stance."" San Francisco Fed president Mary Daly said, ""We don’t need to be preemptive."" Richmond Fed president said Wednesday that ""you want to wait and see.""
Chicago Fed president Austan Goolsbee said Wednesday that if inflation remains persistent the question for the Fed will become whether those price pressures are from new tariffs or increased demand.
""If we see inflation rising or progress stalling in 2025, the Fed will be in the difficult position of trying to figure out if the inflation is coming from overheating or if it’s coming from tariffs,"" Goolsbee said in a speech Wednesday in Detroit.
""That distinction will be critical for deciding when or even if the Fed should act.""

Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) are expecting a cumulative $228 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, driven by their investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure. That’s a 55% increase from the roughly $150 billion those companies reported spending in 2024.
Tech giants contend all this spending will pay off in the long run. Investors aren't so sure. Uncertainty surrounding the timeline for the payoff — along with ongoing debates about whether such high levels of spending are truly justified — continues to fuel concerns with each earnings cycle.
The companies’ higher-than-expected capital expenditures for the upcoming year come just as investors are scrutinizing Big Tech’s hefty artificial intelligence spending.

Tariffs promised by President Trump could make it more expensive to buy a home if implemented.
In the past week, Trump has imposed and then delayed tariffs that experts say would drive up homebuilding costs, a burden that builders could pass on to buyers.
Data from Wolfe Research suggests that if builders can pass along those increased construction costs and raise the price of a new home by $10,000, the monthly housing payment will go up by $48 from $2,470 to $2,518, assuming a 6% mortgage rate buydown.
This would come as affordability concerns are holding many buyers back. According to data from Freddie Mac, the average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.95% last week.
“Indirectly, tariffs are clearly inflationary and imply a higher for longer mortgage rate environment, which is the greatest current demand headwind,” Trevor Allinson, director of equity research at Wolfe Research, wrote in a note to clients.
To this point, the National Association of Home Builders estimates that a mortgage rate increase from 6.0% to 6.25% would raise the monthly payment by $76, pricing out about 1.1 million buyers.
After falling at the open, stocks have rebounded throughout the day.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped just below the flat line, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose about 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.3%.
On a sector basis, interest rate sensitive sectors were leading, with both Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) up more than 1% as the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell nine basis points to 4.43%.
Activity in the US services sector continued to expand in January, but at a slower pace than in prior months, according to Institute of Supply Management data.
The ISM's services index came in at 52.8 for the month, down from December's reading of 54.1 and below economists' expectations of 54. Readings above 50 suggest comparative growth in activity, while those below 50 indicate contraction.
""While the index is still consistent with a broad expansion in activity that remains supportive of hiring, a pull back in new orders and only modest drop in prices paid show some lost momentum potentially stemming from apprehension around tariffs,"" Wells Fargo senior economist Tim Quinlan wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.
The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued its move lower following the release. At last check, the benchmark sat at 4.43%, down about nine basis points on the day.
Last week, the emergence of a new AI model from China's DeepSeek sparked investor concern that the AI spending boom may cool off as companies find cheaper ways to fulfill their AI goals.
This spawned a massive sell-off in Nvidia's (NVDA) stock, with the prevailing thought being that companies may not allocate as much spend to Nvidia's expensive AI chips. But as Big Tech earnings have rolled on, few signs have emerged of a spending slowdown.
The most recent example came on Tuesday night, with Alphabet (GOOGL GOOG) saying it plans to lay out $75 billion in capital expenditure in 2025. That's above Wall Street analysts' estimates of $57.9 billion.
Fundstrat head of research Tom Lee pointed out that Alphabet's increase is ""a reminder that capex plans for AI and data center spending remain strong, even if one thinks DeepSeek represents a threat to those figures.""
To Lee's point, shares of Nvidia, a supplier of AI chips to Alphabet, were up more than 3% in early trade on Wednesday.
Alphabet's (GOOGL,GOOG) stock is down more than 8% after the Google parent reported quarterly results.
Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports:
The company fell short on its important cloud segment revenue. The company also dramatically expanded its capital expenditures for the year ahead, from $57.9 billion to a planned $75 billion.
Alphabet's update comes as China said it's launching an antitrust probe into Google, in what's widely seen as a retaliatory measure by Beijing against President Trump's 10% tariff on goods made in China.
Alphabet is also contending with the fallout from China-based DeepSeek's AI models. News of these rocked the tech world last week, amid claims they were cheaper to train and as capable as leading models from Silicon Valley companies.

US stocks pulled back on Wednesday after earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, with investors on alert for fresh moves in the brewing US-China trade war.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped 0.6%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid roughly 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was roughly flat after the major gauges closed with gains on Tuesday.
I just wrapped a chat with Disney (DIS) CFO Hugh Johnston (airing live this morning on Yahoo Finance) and found these two points of most interest:
European stocks trod water as uncertainty over the US-China tariff face-off continued to dog markets and while investors absorbed corporate results from Santander (SAN) and elsewhere.
The pan-regional benchmark Stoxx 600 (^STOXX) index swung between small gains and losses.
Meanwhile, Germany's DAX (^GDAXI) was little changed, while the CAC (^FCHI) in Paris slipped 0.3% into the red. In London, the benchmark (^FTSE) index traded broadly flat.
Disney (DIS) reported first quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat expectations. The media and entertainment giant reported a profit in its streaming segment, while its parks business faced setbacks in the midst of two back-to-back hurricanes and greater cruise ship investments.
Disney+ subscribers also fell by 700,000 in the quarter as a result of expected user churn amid recent price increases. The company hiked the price of its various subscription plans in mid-October.
Analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected subscribers to decline by 1.41 million. The company had reported a loss of 600,000 Disney+ subscribers in the year-ago period. For the current quarter, the company said it expects another ""modest decline"" in Disney+ subscribers compared to Q1.
Shares ticked up about 2% in premarket trading following the results.
Revenue of $24.70 billion beat expectations of $24.57 billion in the quarter and represented a 5% increase from the prior-year period.
Adjusted earnings per share of $1.76 came in ahead of the $1.42 analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected. Earnings increased 44% from a year ago.
For the full year 2025, Disney reaffirmed guidance of high-single-digit earnings per share growth compared to fiscal 2024. Estimates are calling for an 8.1% increase year over year.
Read more of Disney's earnings results here.
Apple (AAPL) looks set to become the latest tech megacap to get embroiled in the tariff tug-of-war, as it drew the glare of China's antitrust watchdog.
The regulator is laying the groundwork for a potential investigation into Apple's policies and App store fees, Bloomberg reported. Shares fell over 2.5% before the bell.
Beijing has just revived anti-monopoly probes into Google and chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), and its authorities are exploring a new investigation against Intel (INTC), per the Financial Times.
The rush of competition scrutiny is seen as part and parcel of China's retaliation to tariffs imposed on its exports by the Trump administration, as it could provide leverage in trade talks.

Nothing terribly wrong with AMD's (AMD) quarter.
Good data center sales growth of 69% year over year was the standout.
But the stock is being hit in premarket — likely for two reasons. First, said data center growth missed estimates, and second, the company didn't provide enough AI guidance for Wall Street.
Here's what KeyBanc analyst John Vinh called out this morning:
Chipotle's (CMG) stock is getting roasted premarket, down 7%.
The company's earnings had a few things the Street didn't like from this high-multiple name. Sales guidance was soft, the quarterly sales result was soft, and margin commentary was mixed. January sales were off to a slow start too.
""We were disappointed in the comparable sales outlook but believe it could prove conservative, given the upcoming initiatives. Regardless, we reduced our 2025 operating profit estimate by less than 1% (margin better than expected), and we believe the current stock price offers an attractive entry point,"" Stifel's Chris O'Cull said in a note this morning.
O'Cull isn't alone on the Street in defending the stock today.
I'll have more insight into the story around 9:40 a.m. ET — Chipotle CFO Adam Rymer will be on Yahoo Finance for a video interview.
Toyota (TM) raised its full-year operating profit forecast by 9%, signaling confidence in its ability to weather any potential US tariffs.
The world's top-selling automaker updated its profit projection for the fiscal year ending March 2025 to 4.7 trillion yen ($30.7 billion), up from the previous forecast of 4.3 trillion yen.
In addition, Toyota announced plans to set up a wholly owned subsidiary in Shanghai to develop and produce electric vehicles and batteries for its Lexus brand. Production is expected to begin in 2027. The new unit will focus on creating a new Lexus EV with an initial annual production capacity of around 100,000 units.
Despite posting weaker-than-expected third quarter results and marking its second consecutive quarterly profit decline, Toyota's confidence in its future performance remains strong.

The relationship between stocks and crypto markets is likely to weaken in the future, Wall Street bank Citi (C) said in a research report Monday.
While  equities have been and remain the most important macro driver of crypto markets, the ""equity-crypto correlation is likely to fall over time as the nascent asset class matures, the investor base grows, technology advances and adoption progresses,"" the report said.
Still, the speculative nature of cryptocurrency markets means that risk asset correlations may be inflated, especially during risk-off events, the bank said.
""A more transparent regulatory regime in the U.S. will also lead to more idiosyncratic price action,"" analysts led by Alex Saunders wrote.
Bitcoin (BTC) volatility is expected to continue to fall in the long term as institutional adoption grows, the bank said.
Citi noted that crypto was the only asset class whose market cap, as a percentage of U.S. equities, grew during last year.
Bitcoin's correlation to gold is also worth tracking as it may be an early sign of the ""store of value use case,"" the report added.

LG CNS, the information technology services affiliate of South Korean billionaire Koo Kwang-mo’s LG Group, slumped almost 10% in its stock market debut in Seoul on Wednesday. The company ended the day with a market cap of 5.4 trillion won (about $3.7 billion).
The company’s initial public offering was priced at 61,900 won a share, at the top end of its marketed range. The listing raised 1.2 trillion won (about $825 million), making it the biggest IPO in South Korea since LG Energy Solution, LG Group’s electric vehicle battery arm, raised 12.8 trillion won in early 2022—the country’s largest ever. LG CNS will use part of the IPO proceeds for potential acquisitions.
Based in Seoul, LG CNS was established in 1987 as a joint venture between LG and Electronic Data Systems, which was then a subsidiary of General Motors. (EDS was acquired by HP in 2008 for $13.9 billion.) The company changed its name to LG CNS in 2002.
LG CNS provides services related to AI, cloud and IT systems integration and management. The company built IT systems for government organizations, such as South Korea’s National Tax Service and the Ministry of Finance of Indonesia, as well as companies like Kakao Bank and Woori Bank.
For the first three quarters of 2024, LG CNS reported revenues of about 4 trillion won ($2.7 billion) and net income of 233 billion won. About half of its revenue came from cloud and data-related services, such as cloud migration and building infrastructure for enterprise data collection. Its biggest customers are two LG Group companies: LG Electronics and LG Chem. Both LG companies each accounted for about 21% of LG CNS’s total revenues for 2023.
The company’s largest shareholder is LG Corp., the holding company for LG Group, with a 45% stake. Koo, the chairman and CEO of LG Corp., holds a 1% stake in his own name."

Gold’s been hitting new highs and a few gold and silver stocks have been running up to higher highs along with it. It’s hard to say with certainty what the reason is. Inflation concerns are the first thing that come to the mind of an analyst. Or, considering the strangeness in Washington, D.C. these days, the concern might be fear.
Whatever the case, precious metals and the companies that mine for them are having a decent run.
SPDR Gold Shares:
SPDR Gold Shares daily price chart, 2 5 25.
This is the NYSE-traded exchange traded fund that reflects movements in the price of gold. It’s been having a good run: from the early June 2024 low of $212 to the present $264 amounts to a 19.7% return from then to now. Note that both the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages are in up trends.
ASA Gold and Precious Metals:
ASA Gold and Precious Metals daily price chart, 2 5 25.
The price in late January broke out above the October 2024 resistance of $22.75. It’s kicked off February with even higher highs. Both the 50-day and the 200-day moving averages are trending upward.
The South African-founded miner is now domiciled in Bermuda and has a market cap of $477 million. The price-earnings ratio is 7.61 and the stock trades at 1.12 times its book value. ASA in November 2024 paid a .16% dividend.
Franco Nevada:
Franco-Nevada daily price chart, 2 5 25.
A new closing high in February follows the late January peak above the October resistance, shown by the red dotted line. The 50-day moving average has just crossed above the 200-day moving average, a positive sign.
Headquartered in Toronto, the company has a market cap of $27 billion. This year’s earnings are down by 13.15%. Franco Nevada has no debt, long-term or otherwise. The mining firm pays a 1.03% dividend.
Kinross Gold:
Kinross Gold daily price chart, 2 5 25.
The price broke out above the former October and early January resistance levels and took off to new highs. The 50-day moving average has turned upward. The 200-day moving average moves higher steadily.
This Canadian miner has a market cap of $14.51 billion. Earnings this year are up by 71%. The price-earnings ratio is 19.74. The debt-to-equity ratio is .26. Kinross Gold pays a dividend of 1.02%.
Discovery Silver:
Discovery Silver daily price chart, 2 5 25.
The new high came in late January and the stock goes higher since then. That’s a nice breakout above the previous resistance from July 2024 at just under $1.00. Typically, I don’t post former penny stocks but this one seems to be at least worth noting.
This is an OTC stock (also trades on The Toronto Stock Exchange) with an average daily volume of 237,000 shares. Market cap is $433 million. According to the company website, Discovery has “high quality gold producing assets in Canada” and “the world’s largest undeveloped silver deposit in Mexico.”
All of the above precious metals stocks are outperforming the two industry majors, Newmont Mining and Barrick Gold, which are trading better lately but have yet to make it up to new 52-week highs.

US stock futures pulled back on Wednesday after earnings from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and AMD (AMD) fell short, with investors on alert for fresh moves in the brewing US-China trade war.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 futures (NQ=F) led declines, down 0.9%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) dropped 0.5% as markets assessed the latest tech results. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) slipped 0.2%, after the major gauges closed with gains.
Alphabet's stock was under pressure, down almost 7% in pre-market trading, after fourth quarter cloud revenue undershot estimates. The miss rattled investors concerned that the Google parent's hefty spending on AI won't see the hoped-for payoff any time soon.
AI trade hopes were dealt a second blow by AMD's earnings. While the chipmaker posted a quarterly revenue beat, a disappointing data center sales forecast raised worries about a loss of AI momentum. AMD shares tumbled over 8%.
Big Tech names like Alphabet are getting caught up in the tariff tit-for-tat between the US and China, which Wall Street sees as a risk for tech and chip names alike. Apple shares dropped over 2% after a Bloomberg report that Beijing is looking into targeting its app store in an antitrust probe.
President Trump's tariff plans have markets already jumpy, and his unexpected suggestion late Tuesday that the US could take over the Gaza strip and develop it as a ""Riviera of the Middle East"" left investors even more bemused about which direction policy will take next.
But looking past the noisy headlines, the stock market has shown several signs of strength, providing Wall Street with ample reason to stay bullish on further gains.
That said, uncertainty about Trump's tariffs has prompted Morgan Stanley to lower its forecast for US interest-rate cuts this year. It now forecasts just one cut from the Federal Reserve in 2025. Updates on US services activity and private payrolls due later will help set expectations for the path of rates.
On the earnings front, Disney (DIS) is set to report before the bell on Wednesday. The entertainment giant's theme parks and Disney+ streaming platform are both expected to show headwinds.

Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius out this morning with his latest call on tariffs — of note he expects 10% China tariffs as just the starting point""
""While the tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been paused, the 10% additional tariff on imports from China has taken effect, and we expect that these tariffs will remain in effect for the foreseeable future. Our base case is that tariffs on imports from China increase further, though President Trump’s comments since inauguration have put much less emphasis on China than during the campaign. Nevertheless, we expect China-focused tariffs to rise by roughly another 10pp on top of the recently announced tariffs, via higher tariffs on primarily non-consumer products. An even higher tariff rate is a clear possibility—Trump recently mentioned the 60% tariff he proposed during the campaign—but we don’t view this as the base case.""
Nothing terribly wrong with AMD's (AMD) quarter last night.
Good data center sales growth of 69% year over year was the standout.
But the stock is being hit pre-market likely for two reasons. First, said data center growth missed estimates and the company didn't provide enough AI guidance for the Street.
Calls out KeyBanc analyst John Vinh this morning, ""For FY25, management conveyed confidence in being able to deliver double digit year-on-year growth in revenue and adjusted EPS. However, they stopped issuing GPU-related revenue guidance (key to the story in FY24 and a figure investors were keenly listening for), and instead offered mixed commentary tied to MI300 [chip], MI325 and MI350 that implied lower-than-anticipated sales on MI300 and MI325 in 1H25 (Data Center revenues in the first half of 2025 to resemble second half 2024), but a faster-than expected ramp on MI350 starting in mid-2025 (vs. 2H25 prior). Incremental uncertainty around Data Center mix-shift and the pace and scope of GPU product ramp through 2025 is not what we were hoping for, and neither was the market, but we think it could be pointing to a transition period (i.e. ramping faster on MI350 could be impacting MI300 and MI325) that could set up 2H25 and 2026 for outpaced results.""

Gold (GC=F) has surged to a record high, climbing nearly 1% as the first shots of the US-China trade war increase demand for haven assets.
The price of bullion hit an all-time high, topping $2,854 an ounce on Wednesday. This spike followed President Donald Trump’s move to impose a 10% tariff on Chinese imports.
China’s retaliatory efforts have been less aggressive compared to earlier trade conflicts, when tariffs were nearly on par with the U.S. However, concerns remain about the potential impact on the world’s two largest economies. Markets are also closely watching to see if these renewed tariffs could trigger inflationary pressures, which might influence US monetary policy.
Asian stocks were mostly lower Wednesday as markets digested the impact of the trade tensions brewing between China and the US.
The CSI 300 Index (000300.SS) quickly erased its initial gains on the first trading day after the Lunar New Year holiday closure, falling by 0.6%.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 (^N225) slipped 0.2% in early trading. Australia's ASX 200 (^AXJO) rose 0.5%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng (^HSI) dropped 0.6%. South Korea’s Kospi (^KS11) jumped 1.1%
What started as a relatively calm day quickly became volatile after news broke that the US Postal Service would temporarily halt inbound parcels from China and Hong Kong. This move came just one day after both the US and China imposed tariffs on each other’s exports. Although there are still hopes for a deal to ease tensions, investors are pulling back as uncertainty lingers.
The stock outlook remains unclear, largely dependent on further developments in tariff negotiations and China's economic recovery. US President Donald Trump stated there is no urgency to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

66,2025-02-05,"If you’re in the market for a travel credit card with great rewards this year, look no further.
NerdWallet compiled a list of some of the best travel cards currently on the market. 
It considered the rewards, annual feeds, point redemption possibilities, and intro offers to make its decision.
Continue reading to see which ones made the list — and why.
2 / 6
A great option for those averse to annual fees, the VentureOne Rewards card won’t cost you anything and could get you some serious savings, according to NerdWallet. Right now it has an intro offer of 40,000 miles and you can get 1.25 to 5 times the points on money you spend.
3 / 6
NerdWallet recommends another card from Capital One (COF), the Venture Rewards Cards, which comes with a $95 intro fee but better rewards than the Venture One. Cardholders see 2 to 5 times the points on purchases and the card currently comes with an intro offer of 75,000 miles. NerdWallet said the Venture card has easy earnings and effortless redemptions.
4 / 6
NerdWallet identified the Chase (JPM) Sapphire Preferred as a great card for those focused on airline miles. Though the card has a $95 annual fee, it currently has an intro offer of 60,000 points and offers cardholders 2 to 5 times the points on purchases, including 3 times the points on dining. The card also comes with trip cancellation/interruption insurance, an auto rental collision damage waiver, and lost luggage insurance.
5 / 6
NerdWallet says the VentureX is worth its high annual fee of $395. Not only does it come with an intro offer of 75,000 miles, but cardholders get 2 to 10 times rewards on purchases. They also receive a $300 annual credit on bookings through Capital One Travel, 10,000 bonus miles each year they stick with the card, access to 1,300+ airport lounges worldwide, and receive up to a $120 credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck.

67,2025-02-05,"BERLIN, GERMANY - MAY 25: Sundar Pichai, CEO Google and Alphabet attends  the Germany Women and ... [+] Google Partnership event at Google office on May 25, 2023 in Berlin, Germany. (Photo by Boris Streubel/Getty Images for DFB)
Alphabet stock fell about 7% in pre-market trading Wednesday.
The cause? Alphabet — shares of which have risen 43% in the last year — was hit by what I call the beat-and-raise rule. If a company beats investors’ revenue and profit expectations and raises its forecasts, its stock usually pops. If not, the stock likely falls.
Alphabet disappointed and its stock price fell. Shares of Alphabet lost “as much as 9% Tuesday after the company reported fourth-quarter results that missed on revenue expectations,” according to CNBC.
Investors focused most intensely on Alphabet’s cloud services business which generated lower-than-expected revenue and aims to spend $75 billion – about $16 billion more than Wall Street expected -- to “expand on its artificial intelligence strategy,” noted CNBC.
Does the dip in Alphabet stock represent a buying opportunity? Wall Street sees some upside to the stock. Other analysts are struggling to take a bullish stance. Yet the stock may rise if the company’s enormous bet on AI results in faster-than-expected growth.
While Alphabet’s earnings per share beat expectations in Q4, the company’s revenue performance and forecast disappointed analysts.
While EPS beat analysts’ estimates by two cents, Alphabet’s overall revenue grew more slowly than in the prior year – as did growth for the company’s search business, YouTube ads business and services unit, noted CNBC.
Here are the key numbers:
Alphabet’s high capital expenditure are aimed at building more computing capacity to meet demand for cloud services. The capital will pay for servers and data centers “to support the growth of our business across Google Services, Google Cloud and Google DeepMind,” CFO Anat Ashkenazi told investors on the company’s Q4 earnings call, CNBC reported.
Moreover, Alphabet says it lacked capacity to meet 2024 demand for cloud services. Alphabet – whose Google Cloud “trails behind Amazon.com and Microsoft in size,” noted Bloomberg – “exited the year with more demand than we had available capacity. We are in a tight supply-demand situation, working very hard to bring more capacity online,"" Ashkenazi added.
Alphabet’s AI strategy is strong – but there’s room to improve. Since Google scientists developed the transformer model on which generative AI depends, the company should lead the world in AI chatbots as the company does in search. Sadly for Alphabet investors, most of those scientists departed for startups, as I wrote in my book, Brain Rush.
Alphabet has faced questions about Chinese startup DeepSeek — which last month launched powerful models built at a lower cost than their American equivalents. DeepSeek’s chatbot app leaped ahead of ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini to top the app store rankings, according to the Wall Street Journal.
Alphabet expressed confidence in the company’s AI strategy. Google’s Gemini AI leads the market and the company has reduced costs, says Google. “All of that sets us up well for the workloads ahead, both to serve billions of users across our products and on the cloud side,” CEO Sundar Pichai told investors in the conference call, noted the Journal.
Google – which said 4.4 million developers are using Gemini models, twice the number in October 2024 – expects its costs to plunge. “Our obsession with cost per query, I think, sets us up well both to serve billions of users across our products and on the cloud side,” Pichai said.
""Part of the reason we are so excited about the AI opportunity is we know we can drive extraordinary use cases because the cost of actually using (AI) is going to keep coming down, which will make more use cases feasible. And that’s the opportunity space. It’s as big as it comes, and that’s why you’re seeing us invest to meet that moment,” he added, according to Investor’s Business Daily.
Wall Street is moderately bullish on Alphabet stock. Based on 31 Wall Street analysts offering 12-month price targets, Alphabet Class A stock could rise 5.3% to reach the average price-per-share target of $217.22, noted TipRanks.
Google “Cloud’s disappointing results suggest that A.I.-powered momentum might be beginning to wane just as Google’s closed-model strategy is called into question by DeepSeek,” Emarketer analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf wrote in a note featured by the New York Times.
The market may lose enthusiasm for high capital expenditures, said one analyst. ""It’s very hard to defend Google after the earnings report,"" Aptus Capital Advisors portfolio manager Dave Wagner told Reuters.
“DeepSeek has started to teach the market that maybe some things can be done a little bit more efficiently. Maybe we’re starting to see the market dislike the continued increase in capex,” he added.
Another analyst was disappointed with Google Cloud’s slower growth. ""When you start to see that revenue level off or at least the growth start to top off a little bit, how you’re going to finance the future growth of the company becomes an issue,"" Zacks Investment Management client portfolio manager Brian Mulberry told Reuters.
Alphabet stock could rise if the company’s high capital expenditures result in faster-than-expected growth. That would happen sooner if Google could supply a missing killer app for generative AI.
However, if Pichai is right about Gemini’s prospects, buying the stock now might be a bet on market-beating investment returns.

68,2025-02-05,"Ransomware victims paid out 35% less to hacking groups in 2024 compared to 2023 even as the overall number of attacks increased, according to a report by the blockchain research firm Chainalysis.
The large dropâfrom $1.25 billion in ransom payments in 2023 to $813.55 million last yearâcame as international law enforcement operations disrupted some major hacking groups and others abruptly closed up shop.
In February the FBI, U.K. National Crime Agency, and other police agencies made several arrests and seized servers and websites used by the ransomware gang Lockbit, which is believed to have been responsible for thousands of attacks that cost victims more than $120 million.
Not long after, another prolific ransomware group, known as Blackcat or ALPHV, abruptly stopped operating. A message was posted to its website saying that it had been seized by law enforcement, but some of those agencies denied their involvement and experts suspected it may have been an exit scam.
Chainalysis found that the gap is growing between how much money attackers demand in exchange for relinquishing compromised data and how much victims actually pay. “Reporting from incident response firms suggests a majority of clients opt not to pay altogether,” according to the report.
Reliable data on the number of ransomware attacks and their full impact is hard to come by. As Chainalysis noted, leak sites where hacking groups post about their successful infiltrations are full of fabricated or repeated incidents. And victims whose sensitive data has been compromised often downplay attacks and keep the details of payment negotiations secret.
The $813.55 million paid out in 2024 was also less than ransomware victims paid out in 2020 and 2021, according to Chainalysis, even though after the first half of the year the ransom sum was on track to exceed previous years. Payments dropped sharply from July through December, which has become something of a pattern in recent years but was particularly pronounced in 2024.
“The market never returned to the previous status quo following the collapse of LockBit and BlackCat/ALPHV,” Lizzie Cookson, senior director of incident response at Coveware, told Chainalysis. “We saw a rise in lone actors, but we did not see any group(s) swiftly absorb their market share, as we had seen happen after prior high-profile takedowns and closures. The current ransomware ecosystem is infused with a lot of newcomers who tend to focus efforts on the small- to mid-size markets, which in turn are associated with more modest ransom demands.â

Google released its Deep Research tool for Gemini late last year, helping you get in-depth research done in minutes. The tool was only available on the web, but there’s good news if you want to use this feature on the go.
9to5Google reports that Deep Research is now widely available in the Gemini app for Android. Only one Android Authority team member reported seeing the feature on their phone, suggesting a gradual release.
This tool, which is restricted to Gemini Advanced users, is identical to the web-based version. That means you have to first select the “1.5 Pro with Deep Research” option from the drop-down menu up top. From here, you can enter your query, and the tool will show you an outline of the report it will create. You can either edit this outline/plan or tap “start research” to have Google sift through the web and build the report. This report will also offer sources, as you’d expect.
Google notes on its Deep Research support page that the report takes five to ten minutes to create, but that more complex reports can take longer. The company adds that you can leave the chat and then get a notification when the report is ready, and this is reflected in the Gemini app too.
Colleague Mitja Rutnik tried Deep Research at the time of its release and noted that he had “mixed feelings” about it. Mitja found that the tool fared better with broader and simpler topics like interior design and AI chatbots. However, he called it “useless” if you wanted to generate something like a stock market report for a given day.
Google isn’t the only company offering a tool like this. OpenAI followed in the search giant’s footsteps earlier this week by launching its own Deep Research feature. This is powered by the OpenAI o3 model and promises to generate a comprehensive report within 30 minutes."
70,2025-02-05,"CHINA - 2024/09/21: In this photo illustration, a Pfizer logo is displayed on the screen of a ... [+] smartphone. (Photo Illustration by Sheldon Cooper/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)
Pfizer stock (NYSE: PFE) recently reported its Q4 results, with revenues and earnings exceeding the street estimates. The company reported revenue of $17.8 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.63 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $17.4 billion and $0.46, respectively. The company benefited from better than anticipated sales of its Covid-19 products. The company reiterated its outlook for 2025. Separately, after a lowered outlook Should You Pick MRK Stock At $90?
Since the beginning of 2024, PFE stock has underperformed the S&P 500 index, delivering -3% returns compared to the index’s 27% gain. Investor sentiment toward PFE has been negatively impacted by recent corporate decisions, such as the discontinuation of its experimental sickle cell disease treatment. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.
Pfizer’s revenue of $17.8 billion in Q4 reflected a 22% y-o-y growth, led by a 61% surge in Vyndaqel sales and a 14% rise for Eliquis. Also, Paxlovid, Pfizer’s Covid-19 antiviral pill, generated $727 million in sales during the quarter, marking a significant turnaround from the $3.1 billion revenue loss recorded in the same period last year. Excluding Covid-19 products, the top-line expanded 12%. Pfizer’s adjusted net income margin of 20.2% in Q4’24 was much better than the 4.1% in the prior-year quarter. This led to a 6x y-o-y rise in the bottom line to $0.63 during the quarter.
Looking forward, Pfizer maintained its 2025 outlook of sales to be in the range of $61 billion and $64 billion and adjusted earnings to be in the range of $2.80 and $3.00 per share, versus $63.6 billion top-line and $3.11 bottom line in 2024. The company has taken into account the changes to the Medicare program, resulting in a hit of $1 billion on sales in 2025. Pfizer has been focused on improving its profitability, and it has increased the cost-savings target to $4.5 billion by the end of this year.
Although Pfizer posted an upbeat Q4, its stock hasn’t seen any upside post the results announcement. Even if we look at a slightly longer period, the changes in PFE stock over the recent years have been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500.
In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and recent changes in the White House, could PFE face a similar situation as it did in 2023 and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a recovery? While we will soon update our model for Pfizer to reflect the latest results, we think PFE stock remains attractive at its current levels. At levels of $26, it is trading at 8x trailing earnings of $3.11 per share, much lower than the stock’s average P/E ratio of 13x over the last five years. Although a modest downward adjustment to the valuation multiple may be warranted to reflect the lack of a solid long-term revenue growth trajectory after the decline in sales of Covid-19 products lately, we believe the current gap is too wide.
While PFE stock looks undervalued, it is helpful to see how Pfizer’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

72,2025-02-05,"Brain Dead and adidas are bringing back their formal bowling-inspired sneaker. But this time, they've brought pioneering retailer Dover Street Market into the mix. 
Offered in black, as is often the case with DSM footwear collaborations, this is the simplest take on adidas and Brain Dead's bowling shoes yet. White stitching and gold-colored branding stamped on the side are the main hits of contrast against the black leather base. 
It's a simple colorway for an objectively wild hybrid shoe: a leather dress shoe mixed with the soul of an adidas sneaker.
Expected to arrive in stores later this year, the adidas x Brain Dead x DSM bowling shoe is almost a one-to-one replica of an archival adidas model from the '70s. And yet, the design couldn't be more relevant in the present day. 
Hybrid footwear of this ilk is having a real moment right now. We’re seeing a surge in unconventional sneaker mashups — think sneaker-loafers, Nike’s collaborations with PEACEMINUSONE, or adidas and CLOT’s Superstar-inspired clogs. 
These hybrids blend performance sneakers with traditional shoemaking. It's admittedly inventive stuff, and adidas' bowling shoe is the forefather of them all.

Following the introduction of trade tariffs by the US, China is said to be considering an antitrust investigation into Apple's App Store practices. The new US trade tariffs ostensibly imposed on China will be paid by US businesses and consumers, not China or any other foreign country. But they mean higher prices for Americans, which will mean a decrease in sales, so China has been announcing retaliatory measures.According to Bloomberg, those measures may now also include China launching an investigation into Apple's App Store fees and practices. This is despite the country having already investigated the App Store and concluding in May 2024 that Apple was not abusing its market position.The new probe, as yet not officially announced, is said to involve China's State Administration for Market Regulation. It is to review Apple's policies, specifically concentrating on its 30% commission on in-app purchases —  which China previous ruled was in-line with other companies' fees.It's also said to be planning to investigate Apple's restrictions on using third-party payment services and app stores. Chinese regulators have been in discussions with Apple and app developers since the May 2024 ruling, but as yet neither China nor Apple have confirmed the new investigation.Nonetheless, Apple's shares were down 3% on the news.What China has confirmed is that Google will be investigated under the country's anti-monopoly laws. The Chinese Commerce Ministry has separately placed the parent company of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger on its ""unreliable entity"" list.As for the impact on US consumers of President Trump's tariffs, Apple has previously been able to get exemptions. However, it did not get these consistently, and it has so far not escaped them this time.Separately, as tariffs are being applied to goods from different countries in different amounts, certain regions are attempting to position themselves to benefit. India, for instance, has cut key import taxes in order to attract more manufacturing from firms such as Apple.

There is an old proverb, 'we live in interesting times'. I would suggest that now it needs to be updated to say 'we live in insane times'. In 1933 sociopathic criminals took over the Reich Chancellery and ended up murdering millions of people and ultimately causing the death of 12 Million Germans and a destruction of a great many German cities. Now we have a similar sort of situation whereby the plans of the current US administration is going to unleash God only knows what on the world. Just consider some of the recent moves: Patel (a certifiable lunatic) taking over the FBI; RFK (a dangerous conspiracy theorist) taking over the Department of Health; Musk moving chess pieces around the government like its a board game. Now the tariffs are going to ruin Apple's most profitable market outside the US. I don't see how we don't end up with mass chaos and WWIII.

Apple being forced to open up in one way or another (depending on jurisdictions) is basically a given so in this context (although tit-for-tat here) it isn't a surprise.The state of the US administration right now is quite alarming. Both in internal and external (geopolitical) terms. Big Tech and all up and downstream players are in for troubled times.

The ""trade war"" with Canada/Mexico turned out to be nothing more than a publicity stunt. Mexico already had 15,000 troops at the border (Trump wanted 10,000) and Canada had already updated their border security during the last months of the Biden administration. Musk has a lot of business interests in China so he's not going to support a real trade war. Expect another nothing burger in terms of policy changes, similar to Trump's 1st administration.

75,2025-02-05,"Sales of Novo Nordisk’s (NVO) blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy doubled in the fourth quarter, but the Danish pharmaceutical giant warns that sales growth for all its drugs — including Ozempic —  is expected to slow in the coming year.
 Wegovy sales skyrocketed 107% to 19.8 billion Danish Krone ($2.8 billion) in the fourth-quarter of 2024, compared with in 9.6 billion Danish Krone ($1.4 billion) during the the same period last year. The drug just beat analysts’ expectations of $2.7 billion, according to a consensus estimate from FactSet (FDS).
Sales of Ozempic during the quarter rose 7% to $4.7 billion. 
“We are pleased with the performance in 2024, where 26% sales growth reflects that more than 45 million people are now benefiting from our treatments,” Novo Nordisk CEO Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen said in the company’s fourth quarter earnings report.
Novo Nordisk reported that full-year sales of all its drugs grew 26% to $40.5 billion. However, the company projects that sales growth in 2025 will slowdown to between 16% and 24%.
Ozempic and prescription weight-loss drugs: How they work, what they cost, side effects, and everything to know
Overall, the company’s profit rose 23% in the three months ending Dec. 31, reaching $3.9 billion, up from $3.2 billion in the same period the previous year. Fourth-quarter revenue increased 24% year over year to $11.9 billion, from $9.5 billion and surpassing analyst projections of $11 billion. Earnings per share came in at $0.88, exceeding Wall Street expectations of $0.83, according to FactSet.
Wegovy belongs to a class of drugs known as GLP-1 medications — made popular by Novo Nordisk’s diabetes treatment Ozempic. These drugs mimic a hormone that regulates appetite and blood sugar and have become highly sought after as treatments for obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Demand for these medications has turned Novo Nordisk and its rival Eli Lilly (LLY), the maker of competing medications Zepbound and Mounjaro, into the largest pharma companies in the world.
Despite strong demand, Novo Nordisk’s stock has fallen 27% over the past year. A recent dip followed the underwhelming results of CagriSema, its experimental weight-loss and diabetes drug. The medication failed to meet expectations of 25% average weight loss, with patients in a phase 3 clinical trial losing an average of 22.7% of body weight over 68 weeks.
Still, the company’s stock rose nearly 3% during pre-market trading on Wednesday following the earnings release.

76,2025-02-05,"It's hard to deny the demand's there, so dish over that sweet stock.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

While excitement (or derision) might currently be directed towards Nvidia's new graphics cards and AMD's upcoming ones, let's not forget that the past few months has seen the introduction of new CPU line-ups from both Intel and AMD. From Intel, we had the somewhat underwhelming Core Ultra 200S 'Arrow Lake' line-up, and from AMD, we had the first of its 9000-series 'Zen 5' processors. And on the latter front, AMD's now claiming pretty spectacular success.
During AMD's recent Q4 2024 earnings call (transcript here), AMD CEO Dr Lisa Su explained that the company ""saw our highest sell-out in many years, as we went through the holiday season, launching our new gaming CPUs."" Given we've been unable to find reasonably priced AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPUs in stock since launch, this tracks.
Stock sell-outs are, of course, not always due to over-demand but can also be due to under-supply. This is something we're well aware of in the wake of the Nvidia RTX 5080 and RTX 5090 launch, which some are calling a paper launch, ie, a launch in name only with little actual stock to back it.
The 9000-series most certainly wasn't a paper launch, but stock has been hard to come by. Dr Su says: ""We actually think that what we're seeing is very strong adoption of our new products [...] Frankly, [the gaming CPUs] have been constrained in the market, and we've continued shipping very strongly through the month of January as we are catching up with some demand there.""
This is good news amidst the mixed, however, as the earnings call also highlights that the gaming graphics division isn't doing too well—although some of that could be to do with the company nearing the end of a desktop GPU and console GPU generation. On this front, we'll have to see how well the RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT do when they launch in a month or so.
On the CPU front, we can't forget that the market has kind of been set in AMD's favour, too. Yes, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best CPU for gaming on the market by quite a margin, but the competition hasn't exactly been compelling, either. Intel's latest Core Ultra 200S line-up hasn't pushed the boat out very far and many of its 13th and 14th Gen CPUs were plagued with instability issues.
In other words—and not to deny the genuine prowess of AMD's latest desktop and mobile processors—given Intel's offerings, I'd be more surprised if AMD's client CPU division wasn't doing well.
Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.
Of course, this is saying nothing of the mobile side. AMD's latest AI 300 'Strix Point' mobile processors have been adopted not only in laptops but also in the OneXPlayer OneXFly F1 Pro, with presumably more handhelds to come. Intel's not empty-handed on this front either, though, as a Core Ultra 200V 'Lunar Lake' mobile processor sits inside the MSI Claw 8 AI+. Lunar Lake processors are very efficient, but for gaming they seem to struggle to compete with the brute graphical horsepower of Strix Point chips.
The two companies' offerings here are much closer than on the desktop side, though. That's probably why Dr Su says: ""Going into the first quarter, we do expect seasonality in there. But the part of our business that is performing better than seasonality is the desktop portion of the business.""
Great stuff, Su, just get those shelves stacked with fresh Ryzen 7 9800X3D chips and let us satiate that demand. I've seen enough 'out of stock' signs already this year.

77,2025-02-05,"Apple seems to keep hesitating on intriguing new tech categories, giving Samsung an edge in areas like foldables, smart rings, and now smart glasses.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works.

When I heard that Apple had reportedly scrapped its plans for ""Apple Vision Lite"" AR glasses, I was the furthest thing from shocked. Apple cancels projects all of the time, but more than being risk-averse, the Silicon Valley company has shown very little interest in the categories where it doesn't already dominate sales. And Samsung, which seems less afraid to experiment, will reap the benefits.
This is a conservative time for U.S. Big Tech. Not strictly politically — though most tech CEOs have paid homage to Trump — but rather that these companies keep laying off tens of thousands of employees in the name of ""efficiency,"" typically those working on non-AI projects without a tangible, quick path to profits.
Unlike Google and Meta, Apple hasn't had the kind of mass layoffs that prioritize profits over caring about your workers, but it did have several rounds of 2024 layoffs at a smaller scale. And in this kind of environment, everyone needs to justify that their project has a future.
Maybe Apple's ""Apple Vision Lite"" or ""Apple Glasses"" didn't have a future. Wired AR glasses have their niche, but the fact that they reportedly couldn't work with an iPhone limited their potential usefulness and portability outside of XR superfans.
But in this environment of skeptical, penny-pinching executives looking for products that immediately stand out from competitors, it's not surprising that we haven't seen much that's new from Apple in years, aside from the Vision Pro.

Want an Apple Ring as a petite alternative to an Apple Watch? Bloomberg's Mark Gurman says, ""Apple isn’t actively developing a ring and has no plans to launch one,"" despite years of smart ring patents and rumors. That gives Samsung, Oura, and other indie brands free reign.
Want an Apple Flip or Fold? Leakers keep predicting year after year that one is coming — now 2026 is the target, with Apple eyeing a new display manufacturer — but Apple keeps canceling or pushing back its rumored foldable phone so frequently that it feels like Lucy Leaker yanking away the football while Charlie Brown techies get excited over nothing.
Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android
And again, foldable phone brands like Samsung, Motorola, OnePlus, and Honor can keep dominating in this area while Apple dawdles.
I'm sure Meta is thrilled that its Orion AR glasses won't have to compete with Apple's canceled AR glasses in 2027, but the fact that Apple hasn't shown any indication to make ""regular"" smart glasses like Ray-Ban Metas is an even bigger deal.
Apple Music/Photos and Siri in stylish frames would prove insanely popular in one of the fastest-growing product categories. Instead, we've heard nothing on this end either. Meanwhile, Samsung and Google have teamed up for Android XR, and while a mixed-reality Project Moohan headset is the first priority, one leak suggests Samsung will make a no-display smart glasses product next as a Ray-Ban rival.

You can criticize Samsung's tendency to rush products to market and count on name recognition instead of innovation to drive sales. The relatively mid Galaxy Ring is a fair example of this. But what matters more is that it hasn't lost that greedy, ambitious, experimental tendency to try anything new and then iterate to make these products better year after year to strengthen its place in every category.
Frankly, as long as Apple stays out of these product categories, Samsung has less incentive to compete and innovate against its biggest rival, as it does with its Galaxy phones.
Apple has never fully lived up to its Steve Jobs-era reputation for ""thinking differently,"" but it truly feels like it has become so risk-averse in recent years that the only thing its users have to look forward to is Apple Intelligence. And that applies to other Big Tech brands like Google, too, with its Gemini push and Graveyard of other ideas behind it.
My complaint isn't just about ""Apple Vision Lite,"" any more than it is about the Apple Car. It's the fact that, again, my first reaction to the cancelation news was a weary, cynical lack of surprise.
As someone who writes for an Android site but used to exclusively use Apple products out of laziness, I've never been invested in judging one company or ecosystem as ""better"" or mocking Apple when it arrives years late on common Android features. All I care about is the traditional capitalistic idea that competition is good for consumers like you and me.
So, as the biggest tech brands retreat into their most successful niches and monopolies to keep shareholders happy and use shiny AI tricks to keep us complacent, I'll continue to lament how companies other than Samsung seem to be giving up on trying new things.

78,2025-02-05,"Amazon (AMZN) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, and expectations are high. 
Analysts predict strong results for the e-commerce giant, driven by  growth in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud business, contributions from AI, and a “well-managed” holiday season. 
Bank of America (BAC) is forecasting revenue of $187.24 billion, about $1.53 per share, for the fourth quarter, just shy of Wall Street’s consensus of $187.31 billion in revenue, approximately $1.47 per share.  
Analyst Justin Post noted robust fourth-quarter retail data, with Amazon’s core e-commerce business performing well. AWS, in particular, is expected to grow by 19% and 20%, boosted by AI, which the company uses to manage operations, provide entertainment, and assist online shoppers. 
Looking ahead, Bank of America also predicts that Amazon will provide first-quarter sales guidance between $152.25 billion and $158.25 billion, which is slightly below market expectations of $158.7 billion. Despite this, BofA maintains a buy rating on Amazon’s stock, with a price target of $255, citing the company’s strong profit growth and AI positioning. 
Amazon shares have increased roughly 5.8% in the previous month, reflecting investing optimism ahead of the earnings report. 
Beyond earnings, Amazon is navigating other challenges, including looming tariffs on Chinese imports from President Donald Trump. While these tariffs could disrupt e-commerce rivals like Temu and Shein, Amazon is in a strong position. With its established U.S. infrastructure, faster shipping capabilities, and fewer-tariff related hurdles, Amazon is well-positioned to absorb those types of cost increases. To compete with the Chinese fast-fashion giants, Amazon launched ultra-cheap platform Haul in Nov. 2024.
Despite struggles in its physical stores, Amazon’s delivery network continues to excel. In 2024, the company set new delivery speed records, with over 9 billion items arriving the same or next day globally. U.S Prime members saved an estimated $95 billion on free shipping last year, with an average customer saving over $500 in delivery fees. 
As Amazon prepares to report earnings, all eyes will be on how its growth stacks up against Google’s (GOOGL), which recently failed to woo Wall Street. As one of the nation’s largest employers, with a market cap of $2.5 trillion, the tech behemoth’s  ability to maintain its leadership in cloud services and delivery – and sustain its dominance in e-commerce – remains to be seen.

79,2025-02-05,"Ferrari Enzo (Photo by Cameron J Spencer/Getty Images)
The traditional auto industry is in turmoil and as usual nothing seems to trouble legendary Italian luxury sports car maker Ferrari, expected to improve profits again in 2025.
The idea that Ferrari rolls serenely on, floating over economic downturns, tariff wars and potholes might seem contradictory given its usual wailing, screeching V-12 resonance. But in 2025, Ferrari’s first electric sports car might well do just that by filling your rear-view mirror and disappearing in a silent instant.
Ferrari’s profits rose to €2.56 billion ($2.67 billion) last year. That’s up modestly from 2023’s EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) of €2.28 billion ($2.37 billion), and a slight improvement on the forecast of €2.45 billion ($2.55 billion).
Ferrari said its order book is full through 2026, and that all the production of 799 €3.6 million ($3.75 million) F80 supercars have been sold.
“We’re not into an electric transition, we’re rather doing electric addition,” CEO Benedetto Vigna said at a presentation of the 2024 financial results.
The EV will be launched on schedule on October 9 and is expected to cost more than €500,000 ($520,000). Five other new models will be launched this year, in addition to pure gasoline, gasoline hybrids, plug-in hybrids, and now electric models.
Analysts were impressed and expect more of the same profit growth for the foreseeable future.
“We continue to view Ferrari as uniquely positioned, defensive business with the order book extending well into 2026, that can achieve high single-digit top-line growth and double-digit profit growth with relatively low volatility to earnings,” said investment bank Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley recommends Ferrari as an “overweight” investment.
Investment researcher Bernstein, in a report entitled “Setting a new baseline for profitability” said fat profit margins will get fatter.
Ferrari prancing horse emblem.
“A year ago Ferrari said it was increasingly confident of achieving the upper end of its 2026 target margin corridor of 27-30%. Ferrari’s 2025 guidance is already for about 29.0%. Considering that 2026 will include a full year of F80 deliveries, that upper end or 30% margin target looks even more achievable,” Bernstein said in the report.
Bernstein rates Ferrari as an “outperform” stock.
Investment bank UBS joined in the praise and pointed out in a report that Ferrari, unusually, expects the first half of 2025 to be more positive than usual.
“Ferrari results proved once again the strength of the brand and business model, as high-end demand continues to exceed supply despite the macro conditions,” UBS said.
“The first half weighted outlook de-risks the year and leaves room to potentially surprise on the upside in the second half. In addition, six model launches provide plenty of catalysts, with the most important being the capital markets day on 9th October when the next mid-term plan will be unveiled, together with the long-awaited Ferrari Elettrica,” UBS said.
UBS rates Ferrari as a “Buy”.
In 2024 Ferrari opened a new production line at its Maranello, Italy headquarters and was at pains to point out this didn’t signal a change in its long-established policy of never making quite enough snarling, howling, beguiling sports cars for the super-rich to satisfy demand.
Ferrari said the extension would add an additional production line to improve production efficiency, not increase output drastically. The new facility was said to have cost about €200 million ($208 million). Ferrari management denied a Reuters report that this would allow annual sales to reach around 20,000, up from 2023’s 14,000.

This long post by Mike Brock at Techdirt does a great job in laying out the many reasons why we should be concerned about Elon Musk’s power grab. Here’s just part of the section about all of the federal laws he is breaking:
When Congress passed 18 U.S.C. § 208, they were imagining scenarios where federal officials might have access to some information that could affect their private interests. But Musk’s situation goes far beyond anything the drafters likely contemplated—he has gained access to the actual machinery of government while simultaneously running multiple companies directly affected by that machinery.
Consider what this means in practice: Through DOGE, he has access to sensitive Treasury data while running public companies whose stock prices could be affected by that information. He can see classified materials while controlling SpaceX, which competes for national security contracts. He has visibility into federal agency operations while owning a social media platform that shapes public discourse about those agencies.
The Ethics in Government Act and STOCK Act were designed to prevent federal officials from using nonpublic information for private gain. But Musk isn’t just getting occasional access to sensitive information — he’s gained unprecedented access to core government systems while maintaining control of companies worth hundreds of billions of dollars. The potential for using this access to benefit his private interests isn’t incidental — it’s systematic and structural.

81,2025-02-05,"You’ve probably never heard of Advance Paris, but the prestigious French audio manufacturers are hoping to change that, today announcing that its premium lineup of amplifiers and hi-fi separates, adorned with their signature luminous VU meters, are now available to the U.S. market.
Hi-fi enthusiasts and audiophiles will undoubtedly be most interested to get their hands on Advance Paris’ most popular component, the flagship A12 Classic Integrated Amplifier. The 120-watt-per-channel (into 8 ohms) integrated amplifier combines both solid state and tube amplification, with two tubes on the pre-amplification section for that smooth, warmer sound that only tubes can deliver.
The A12 features dual toroidal transformers to deliver its substantial Class A/B amplification that Advance Paris says will handle any speakers — from bookshelf to towers — with ease.
But we’ve buried the lede here: the Advance Paris A12’s clean design is likely to be as much of a draw as its power. The face of the A12 features a sleek black finish, clean machined aluminum dials and buttons, and its glowing orange tubes can be seen tucked back within the chassis. But the flagship feature the brand has become known for (that McIntosh fans may find familiar) is the amplifiers glowing blue VU meters that have been the brand’s signature since 2003.
Little else is known about the Advance Paris A12 integrated amplifier, but it’s also a Swiss Army knife when it comes to connectivity and includes: 2 HDMI ports (on eARC), a trio of optical and coaxial digital inputs, 5 RCA AUX line inputs (one for CD), a dedicated Phono (MM/MC) input for turntables, 2 USB ports, two sets of balanced XLR inputs and optional Bluetooth (with a Bluetooth module).
Available online and through its U.S. dealer partners, the A12 Classic Integrated Amplifier runs a substantial $3,799.
Advance Paris also highlighted several other hi-fi separates that have landed on U.S. shores, including its more attainably-priced integrated amplifier, the 75-watt-per-channel X-i75 ($999); the X-CD9 CD player that features a digital output as well as an analog output, as highlighted by its glowing-tubes ($1,199), and a 115-watt-per-channel streaming amplifier, the PlayStream A7 ($1,999), an ethernet and Wi-Fi network player with support for services such as Spotify, Deezer, Qobuz, and Tidal.
“American hi-fi enthusiasts have been asking for Advance Paris for many years, but we have been slow and deliberate about our expansion into each new territory, making sure we secure the right partners at the right time,” said Advance Paris product manager, Cédric Léon. “The United States is an exciting market for us and it feels fitting that we have found our footing here on this important anniversary as a brand.”
Advance Paris’ full lineup can be found at its website.
Super Bowl LIX is shaping up to be quite the spectacle. For the first time ever, when the Kansas City Chiefs defend the Super Bowl title against the Philadelphia Eagles on February 9, at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, some viewers will be able to watch the game with both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.
Comcast and Dolby are bringing the game with both technologies to Xfinity TV customers on the Fox broadcast. It's a part of Comcast's Enhanced 4K on Xfinity X1. We first saw this level of presentation with the Paris Olympics last summer, with an ultra-low latency allowing for a delay of only a few seconds. Comcast says the Super Bowl will have a similar lag of only a few seconds behind the game action.

	Last week’s announcement that the AFM would be returning to L.A. met with approval from U.S. professionals, after its ill-fated sojourn in Las Vegas last November.

	Back in Europe, small to medium sized sales companies, who have long since stopped attending the AFM due to the cost, are increasingly discussing the lack of a fully-fledged fall market in the region to mop up sales on films launched at the late summer to early fall festivals.

	Former sales agent and AFM regular Meissner says she is too soon into her new role to assess whether this dynamic is having a knock-on effect on the EFM.

	“I also haven’t been at the AFM since 2019 so I can’t make an informed analysis… From my perspective as a sales agent, it really depends on the type of film or project, but it’s also true some of the European sales agents simply can’t afford to go to the AFM,” she says.

	“We’ll see how it develops. I always thought it was really complementary and would be sad if that wasn’t the case, so I wish them the best.”

	She suggests that the EFM’s place in the calendar still works as the first major market of the year, for both films sales and packaging. Quizzed on whether the EFM would consider running initiatives to support the packaging business, Meissner says it is not currently on the cards but does not rule it out.

	“The EFM timing is very beneficial for announcements, that’s true, but it’s also true that we’re a service platform. We don’t have to substitute the job of the sales agents. They know best when and how to launch a project. It’s quite organic, but it could be something for the future.”

	










	On the completed film sales front, driven by the festival selection, the market has been broadly positive about Tricia Tuttle’s inaugural line-up and Meissner is upbeat too.

	Tuttle told Deadline in interview after the main line-up announcement that she had created the new second competitive section, Perspectives, focused on first features, partly with the market in mind, hoping these films by emerging talents would create strong buzz. 

	Meissner, who has yet to see much of this selection, approves of the move, citing her own experiences. “I’ve done significant business on first timers, especially at Memento, so I imagine it can create some business,” she says.

	She also praises Tuttle’s grasp of what is at stake: “It’s super important to have a director of the festival who understands the market needs. It’s key. The market and the festival are interdependent. If the films are strong in the Official Selection are strong it will translate into significant business.”

	Meissner is unique among current film market directors for her perspective on the circuit having worked as a film sales agent for two decades, firstly for Celluloid Dreams and then Memento.

	But the German-French industry veteran is keen to highlight her wider credentials as she talks to Deadline about her inaugural edition.

	“My new role brings together everything that I’m passionate about and have been cultivating over the years, having worked in various capacities in the industry,” she says.

	“I started out as an intern at the Berlinale in 1995 and then I was a press agent with Richard Lormand,” she continues, referring to the late much-loved film publicist who handled a raft of Palme d’Or, Golden Lion and Golden Bear winners across his career.  “I have a 360-degree perspective.”

Taking up the role in May, under the official title of Director of Berlinale Pro, Meissner also has oversight on all the festival’s industry-related initiatives, spanning Berlinale Talents, the Berlinale Co-Production Market and the World Cinema Fund.

	The new umbrella grouping, she explains, has been created to integrate these strands more closely to keep them relevant to the film and TV industries and better serve their professionals in a rapidly chasing landscape.

	“We want to be more than a market,” says Meissner. “To be clear, the sellers and the buyers, are at the heart of the EFM, they have the pole position, so to speak, but we have a large number of other professionals that have also come to the market, including a lot of producers.”

	Meissner’s incoming priority beyond ensuring an environment that supports transactional business, has been fostering opportunities for learning and networking

	She points to the new Innovation Hub, which will take over the second floor of EFM’s main Gropius Bau venue, as an example of this. The space will showcase cutting edge technologies and AI solutions.

	“Being a producer has become a lot more complex… Movie-making craft was once about one thing and now it’s about mastering a lot of tools,” says Meissner.

	Alongside companies showcasing new technology and AI solutions, panels and workshops are being laid on under the umbrella of the parallel Producers Hub.

	Danish company Publikum will give a talk on how to build an audience using AI; Microsoft is holding an event on the art of AI prompting and producers body EAVE is running a workshop on their AI playbook.

	










	“We need to find the right balance between innovation and being mindful about copyright protection as well,” says Meissner.

	“There’s also this huge ethical problem around AI so we will be talking about that too. It’s still polarizing. I’m not diminishing how dangerous it can, but we need to a keep balance between them.”

	The European Parliament is holding one such session in the wider EFM Industry Sessions program, presenting the European Union’s AI Act and its findings on how the technology is reshaping the region’s audiovisual landscape.

	The wider five-day industry program encompasses discussions on hot topic industry issues such as gender equality and representation, film production case studies, territory focuses, project showcases and masterclasses, with the more than 100 speakers including CAA’s Roeg Sutherland, Plan B’s Dede Gardner and Picturehouse’s Clare Binns.

	On the networking front, Meissner has also spearheaded the launch of the new daily Breakfast Club, Happy Innovation Hour, Buyers Happy Hour and the DocSalon Apéros

	Other innovations include the new €5,000 Gen Z Audience Award at the Berlinale Co-Production Market, showcasing 35 projects in search of finance. It will be judged by a Franco-German jury of film students, who will designate the project they consider to be the most attractive for young cinema-goers between the ages of 20 and 28.

	“We also want to stay culturally relevant and that’s why it’s important to me to have the next generation feel welcome… and to get their fresh perspective. Everybody speaks about the young audience and questions can we bring it back to the cinemas. One way is by addressing them on how we conceive films at a very early stage,” she says.

	Meissner is also proud to have launched the new EFM Distributor Award.  Sponsored by Dutch film and TV rights management company Fintage House, the €7.5k ($7.8k) will fete a distributor who has made a significant and sustained contribution to arthouse distribution in recent years.

	“It’s a way of showing recognition for an often-undervalued profession,” she says.  “Economically and politically, distributors make a meaningful contribution to the ecosystem, but while there are a lot of incentives for production there is a real need for improved infrastructure around distribution support. Films don’t exist when they don’t have an audience.”

	The three-person jury consists of Natalie Jeung at French sales company Kinolgy, Kim Foss at Danish distributor Camera Film and Leila Hamid at Germany’s X-Verleih.

	On the logistics front, the market has added a screening venue at the University of Applied Sciences across the street from the Gropius Bau, which joins six other venues including the CinemaxX cinema, Marriott Studio and the Gropius Bau Cinema.

	“We know how important screenings are and we really try to accommodate everyone. Sometimes it’s only one screening, sometimes it’s more,” says Meissner. 

	She notes that the EFM has also sought to keep rein in fee increases for stands and screenings, even if the market is facing inflationary costs around everything from energy costs to the hiring of furniture.

	“In 2023, the EFM took into account that everybody was heavily impacted by the pandemic and didn’t raise prices, while our costs have risen by 30, 40%,” says Meissner. “It was an important step for my colleague Peter [Head of Sales Peter Domsch] to say he wanted to keep the prices at a competitive level, and we still have this year.”

	










	The EFM has attempted to deal with rising costs, she explains, by reducing equipment in the booths or suggesting simpler structures, such as taking out the back office, for example, which reduces the build price. 

	“We have adjusted and partially reduced the stand prices per square meter and at the same time slightly reduced the included articles so that our customers do not have any additional costs for the time being,” she said. 

	“After the high price increases in all areas of production, it was clear that we had to find a solution together and at the same time not make access to the market more expensive.”

83,2025-02-05,Temu parent company PDD stock pared its losses after USPS said it would resume accepting packages from China after a brief pause.
84,2025-02-05,"China’s antitrust watchdog is reportedly eyeing a formal probe into Apple’s (AAPL) fees for app developers, giving CEO Tim Cook another problem to worry about as the U.S.’ trade war with Beijing kicks off. 
The State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) is looking at Apple’s policies, such as taking as much as a 30% cut of in-app spending and blocking external payment services, Bloomberg News reports, citing people familiar with the matter. The regulator’s officials have spoken with Apple executives since last year, according to Bloomberg. 
Although China first began investigating Apple last year, an official probe could heighten tensions with the U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday slapped Chinese imports with 10% tariffs, prompting Beijing to hit back with its own tariffs, which begin next week, export controls related to critical minerals, and a series of targeted actions at companies including Google (GOOGL). 
Apple stock slipped 2% in pre-market trading on Wednesday. Last week, the tech giant reported first-quarter earnings that largely met Wall Street’s expectations, although iPhone revenue failed to meet the mark. The company has had a tough time in China recently as domestic smartphone manufacturers erode its market share with their new devices.
Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said Wednesday that Apple is less worried about a probe’s hit to revenue and more concerned with the “overall tone” for Big Tech. Ives noted that Apple gets less Services revenue in the region compared to others and that the App Store only brings in about $5 billion each year, according to Wedbush’s calculations. 
“That said, this is all a game of high stakes poker between Trump and China and Apple is clearly a chip on the table,” Ives wrote in a note. “We believe this is a very contained risk” and that Apple will return to growth in the region by the June quarter, he added. 
Apple isn’t the only one facing a potential investigation. The Financial Times, reports that Chinese regulators are looking into opening a formal probe into struggling tech giant Intel (INTC). Last October, the Cybersecurity Association of China, an industry group, alleged Intel “constantly harmed” Beijing’s interests.
The SAMR on Tuesday said Google was suspected of violating anti-monopoly laws. In December, the SAMR launched a probe into Nvidia’s (NVDA) 2020 acquisition of Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies. China’s Commerce Ministry on Tuesday also placed biotechnology firm Illumina (ILMN) and Calvin Klein (PVH) and Tommy Hilfiger owner PVH Corp. on its “unreliable entity” list, paving the way for sanctions. 
And DeepSeek, an artificial intelligence startup, has shaken up Silicon Valley with its latest — cheaply developed — models, slamming major tech stocks. Some tech leaders are questioning whether DeepSeek actually spent as little money as it claims it did developing the model, while Microsoft (MSFT) is probing whether DeepSeek had access to OpenAI tech that could be behind some of its abilities

                President Trump has ended the de minimis duty-free exception for China, as part of his imposition of tariffs. The app for Shein, the Chinese-founded discount online retailer, is seen here on a smartphone.

A trade loophole called de minimis helped drive explosive growth for bargain sites such as Temu and Shein, allowing them to ship cheap goods from China to U.S. consumers without having to pay taxes and import duties.
But that now stands to change, after President Trump signed an executive order stating de minimis treatment ""shall not be available"" for products made in China, the top source of goods imported to the U.S.
The effects could be far-reaching: De minimis shipments account for most of the cargo entering the U.S., Customs and Border Protection said last fall. The agency said it was handling some 4 million de minimis shipments every day — a rate that would blow past the previous year's mark of more than 1 billion shipments.
When asked to comment on the U.S. shift, Teresa Murray of the Public Interest Research Group consumer watchdog told NPR that her group supports changes to the law.
De minimis shipments ""often don't have as much documentation, making it easier to get the shipments into the United States, whether we're talking about unsafe consumer products or fentanyl or food items that aren't permitted to be imported,"" Murray said.
Here's a quick guide to de minimis:
De minimis is a Latin term denoting something that is ""trifling or of little importance,"" according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. It became law in the U.S. Tariff Act of 1930, as a way to let people skip import fees for small-value shipments.
But over the past decade, de minimis has loomed large: such shipments to the United States rose from 140 million in 2014 to 1 billion in 2023, according to the White House.
About 100 countries have de minimis exceptions, based on a wide range of monetary thresholds. The U.S. level used to be $200, but it rose to $800 in 2016 — one of the highest in the world — when then-President Barack Obama signed the bipartisan Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act. Across the European Union, the level is 150 euros (about $156).
Items imported under the exemption ""are free of duty and taxes and are subject to expedited clearance processing,"" the U.S. International Trade Commission notes.
Backers of the existing de minimis structure say it eases commerce and gives consumers low prices; critics say it is used to hawk ""cheap crap,"" as one lawmaker put it, and gives foreign companies an unfair advantage over domestic retailers.
Even before Trump was sworn in last month, de minimis was being targeted for change. The Biden administration proposed a new rule last fall to close the loophole. And U.S. agencies and politicians have said the law is prone to abuse, from unscrupulous retailers falsely labeling expensive items as costing under $800 to criminals shipping illegal drugs under the guise of innocuous goods.
As Trump's new 10% tariff on Chinese goods took effect, the U.S. Postal Service said on Tuesday that it was suspending acceptance of packages sent from China and Hong Kong — but it reversed course on Wednesday, saying it's working with Customs and Border Protection on a way to collect the new tariff ""to ensure the least disruption to package delivery.""
Together, Temu and Shein accounted for about 17% of the U.S. discount market in 2023 for items such as consumer goods, fast fashion, and toys, according to a report on de minimis policies that the Congressional Research Service (CRS) updated last week.
Neither company responded to NPR's request for comment about the new U.S. de minimis policy before this story was published.
Murray, of the Public Interest Research Group, said her group supports bipartisan legislation such as the Ensure Accountability in De Minimis Act, which would limit which shipments can benefit from de minimis rules.
""Restricting what qualifies for a de minimis exemption would help keep more unsafe toys and other products from getting into our homes,"" Murray said. ""This would make people in the United States safer.""
But she also said that lowering the U.S. limit on de minimis wouldn't be enough to stop shipments of small packages that go directly from Temu and Shein to U.S. consumers without close inspection.
Exporters also use ""master cartons"" (large containers holding individually wrapped boxes) and transshipments (transferring cargo to another container or vessel) to obscure products' origins and contents, according to the CBP.
While the new U.S. policy targets China, both Temu and Shein seem to be trying to become more global. 
They're among the Chinese-founded businesses that have shifted key parts of their corporate structures outside of China. The CRS report notes that Shein doesn't sell goods within China and has a parent company that ""is based in Singapore and tied to a holding company in the British Virgin Islands,"" while Temu's parent company, PDD Holdings¸ ""changed its legal domicile from the PRC to Ireland.""

Big Tech is rolling back DEI measures. Europe's tech sector is yet to feel the same pressure, but industry insiders expect some of the sentiment from the US to spill over across the Atlantic.

        Meta and Amazon have recently scaled back their diversity initiatives amid a wider pushback against DEI in corporate America.
    

        Founders and investors in Europe see it as an omen of what could transpire on the continent.
    

        ""The US can be a lead indicator of what could happen in Europe concerning diversity,"" said Rodney Appiah, managing partner at Cornerstone VC, a fund that backs underrepresented founders. ""We recognize that we are probably four to five years away from that sort of translating into Europe and certainly into the UK.""
    

        Appiah pointed to the collaborative nature of the tech and VC industry and the UK's dependency on the US tech market. ""The US narrative will eventually have a contributing factor to the way in which Europe moves,"" he told Business Insider.
    

        Diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in Europe could come under pressure if big-name companies in the US continue to scale back initiatives, said Michael Smets, professor at Oxford's Said Business School.
    

        That's because ""global companies have global policies,"" Smets told BI. ""The idea that Microsoft et al. would roll back DEI programs in the US, but not in Europe, seems nave.""
    

        While Microsoft has not announced any recent rollbacks of DEI initiatives, the tech giant laid off a diversity, equity, and inclusion team in July.
    

        European tech companies would also look to their larger peers in the US for ""inspiration,"" Smets added.
    

        ""When leaders don't know how to navigate an uncertain, new situation, they are likely to copy leading organizations in their field,"" he explained. ""Doing the same as Big Tech — whether right or wrong — is much more defensible than the bold choice of going against the grain,"" he added.
    

        Some US corporate heavyweights, such as JPMorgan, have said they remain committed to DEI efforts.
    

        Europe's tech companies may look to Silicon Valley for inspiration, but they have historically had different approaches to DEI.
    

        European founders and investors often cite the benefits DEI efforts can bring.
    

        ""The return on investment on DEI has been forgotten about as everything has become politicized,"" Amardeep Parmar, cofounder of BAE HQ, a platform for British-Asian entrepreneurs, told BI.
    

        He added that hiring from underrepresented groups gives companies access to a wider talent pool. That can lead to commercial benefits, Parmar said.
    

        ""People aren't so easy to fool, though, and you've got to match your words with your actions — we returned 3-8x for our sponsor organizations in 2024,"" he said.
    

        President Donald Trump has issued executive orders to scrap DEI offices and positions throughout the federal government and revoked a civil rights-era Equal Employment Opportunity executive order. Trump, along with Elon Musk, has instead called for an approach that prioritizes meritocracy.
    

        Radha Vyas, cofounder and CEO of travel startup Flash Pack, told BI that DEI initiatives could ""level the playing field for everyone"" to ensure people are promoted on merit.
    

        She pointed to data-driven processes ""such as blind CV screening and merit-based promotions — that focus on skills and performance rather than subjective factors or unconscious prejudice.""
    

        Europe's current political system could act as a buffer against the influx of anti-DEI sentiment in the US.
    

        ""The UK political environment is quite different to several other countries because we're one of the very few Western economies that has a left-leaning government in situ, and so that provides a bit of a defense to kind of our politics descending into sort of culture wars,"" Appiah told BI.
    

        Still, the rise of populist parties in Europe could supercharge a wave of negative sentiment against home-grown diversity policies.
    

        Ruth Foxe Blader, general partner at Foxe Capital, pointed to the ""rising legitimacy of populist movements"" in Germany, France, and the UK.
    

        ""It's a way of doing that negative virtue signaling that politicians perceive people want to hear right now, and it's going to take a lot of courage for leaders of large companies in Europe to contest that sentiment,"" Blader told BI.
    

        Some quarters of Europe's tech scene believe that any shift from existing diversity programs in Europe could be channeled into meaningful change.
    

        ""We're likely to see a move away from performative, tick-the-box DEI activity and a move towards DEI actions that are material to, and specifically designed for, and properly integrated within, the businesses in question,"" said Hannah Leach, partner at VC firm Antler.
    

        She added that the US could also prompt more urgent conversations and reframing of what DEI initiatives do and what they should look like in Europe.
    

        Industry insiders are expecting a DEI reckoning for Europe's tech sector — it's just a matter of when.
    

        ""When America sneezes, the rest of the world catches a cold,"" Appiah said.

Partiful (rear) and Apple Invites on the App Store
Add another one to Apple's list of third-party apps that it has endangered, as Apple Invites threatens the livelihood of event planning app Partiful. It happens so often that there is a name for it, based on one of the earliest examples of Apple releasing an app or a feature to compete with a third-party rival. Developers know it as Sherlocking, and they know very well that it can be the end of their business.With a glass half-full kind of view, though, there is a way to argue that Apple producing an app to rival yours will actually grow the market. There is even some logic to that, in two ways.First, Apple will always promote something just about infinitely more and better than any small developer can. So it will make more people aware of, in this case, party or event planning.Then it's also true that Apple will only go so far in its apps. Apple apps tend to be very good —  although Apple Invites is a bit shaky —  yet they are never the most powerful option.Apple Reminders, for instance, is an exceptionally well-made To Do app, but nobody will ever downgrade to it from Things 3, Todoist, or OmniFocus. Apple Calendar is excellent, but there's still a strong market for the much more feature-rich Fantastical.Partiful isn't as well known by iPhone users as the likes of Fantastical or OmniFocus, but it's also considerably newer than those.  While the company was founded as a website in 2020, it wasn't until 2024 that it launched either an iOS or an Android app.Even so, Partiful's developers have been critical of Apple's launching Apple Invites. just reviewing the apple developer guidelines pic.twitter.com/HohuNn0YoM—   Partiful (@partiful) February 4, 2025 What may make Apple's move more painful is that even if you hadn't noticed Partiful's launch, Apple had.

There was no possibility, though, that Apple Intelligence would not feature Writing Tools. As far as AI and LLMs go, grammar-checking is particularly low-hanging fruit.
So you can argue that Apple is just pursuing the inevitable evolution of its apps and OS.
But what you probably can't argue is that it's going to continue doing Sherlocking developers.

Anyone in the tech industry long enough learns the lesson that if you stand still for too long (rest on the success from a single innovation), you're dead in the water. Anything successful will inevitably be cloned in time. It's happened to Apple throughout their history too, and the only way they survived was by continually innovating.

It hurts, but it would be hard to name the functionality of an app that Apple could decide to make which doesn’t currently have a counterpart in the App Store. I mean “There’s an app for that” basically says that whatever you think of doing, someone else can already sell it to you.

88,2025-02-05,"Apple has begun the mass production of its M5 chip, which is set to power next-generation products, including the upcoming Mac series and iPad. Coinciding with long-standing reports, the Cupertino-based tech brand is establishing a new node process for packaging the semiconductor. The technology is intended to provide improved AI performance on the devices it powers, according to ETnews.
Industry sources told the Korean publication that Apple began packaging the M5 chip last month. Taiwan’s TSMC began the initial production of the M5 chip circuit using its 3nm process (N3P). The technology is expected to improve the power efficiency of the M5 chip by between 5% and 10%, and performance by 5% in comparison to the previous M4 chip, which will aid in improving AI performance on upcoming Mac and iPad models.
Apple is known to be releasing a series of M5 chips, including the M5, M5 Pro, M5 Max, and M5 Ultra, each with its own performance and application levels.
Other companies assisting in packaging the M5 chip series are ASE in Taiwan, Amkor in the U.S., and JCET in China. The additional outsourcing suppliers are preparing to need extra facilities to expand the mass production of the high-end chips, including Pro, Max, and Ultra, ETnews detailed.
“Orders for equipment to expand the mass production volume of the M5 are continuously being made,” an industry insider told the publication.
“As it has begun full-scale production, it will be installed in Apple devices that will be released in the future,” they added.
Previous rumors suggested that Apple’s M5 launch might be lackluster, but that was before the brand made its intent in the AI market apparent. Notable analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in December 2024 that the earliest M5 models should begin mass production during the first and second quarter of 2025, while the M5 Ultra would likely begin mass production in 2026. He added that higher-end chips would be “better suited for AI inferencing.”
A new Vision Pro model will enter mass production during the second half of 2025, according to reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, and it will be powered by the yet-to-be-announced M5 chip. The headset will also get Apple Intelligence, which, combined with its spatial computing, will be its main selling point.
It's expected that other design, spec, or hardware elements won't change much, which should help keep the price from going up. Instead, Kuo speculates that the price will stay pretty much the same, giving Apple another chance to provide enough value to justify the $3,000 price tag.
Apple is doing something crazy with its new M4 chip. Although we're used to seeing new Apple silicon debut in Macs, Apple is bringing the M4 chip to the new iPad Pro first. The updated chip, which comes with an entirely new CPU architecture, builds on the GPU found in the M3 chip with ray tracing, mesh shading, and Apple's special Dynamic Cache.
With the M4, Apple says the new iPad Pro can deliver the same performance as a thin-and-light PC while using only a quarter of the power. That's due in no small part to the 3nm architecture the chip uses. The power envelope, according to Apple's claims, is all the more impressive considering the iPad Pro doesn't have any active cooling.
There’s no doubt that the introduction of new M3 chips was the main event at Apple’s Scary Fast show. Yet, it looks possible that the M3 Pro might actually have a significant downgrade compared to the Apple silicon chips that came before it.
Apple explained that the M3 Pro chip in the 16-inch and 14-inch MacBook Pro is up to 40% faster than the M1 Pro in the 16-inch MacBook Pro. Yet, as spotted by MacRumors, there are some situations where the latest chips actually look a little worse than their predecessors -- at least on paper.

89,2025-02-05,"Tomas Milar is the Founder and CEO of Eqvista, an equity management platform. 
 
Founders frequently underestimate the equity dilution impacts of funding rounds and employee stock option plans (ESOPs). Consider two stark examples: Eric Yuan's ownership in Zoom dwindled to 22% by its IPO even after bootstrapping, while Robin Chase's stake in Zipcar plummeted from 30% to 3% in just two years!
Such drastic drops in ownership percentages highlight the importance of dilution analysis. Hence, here's how you can leverage your cap table to gain actionable dilution insights. This will enable you to make decisions like how much equity you can offer to investors without giving up too much control.
You may believe that sharing pre-money and post-money valuations with prospective investors provides enough context, but they would likely disagree. Unlike stock market investors who can exit whenever they please, private equity investors are more concerned with long-term dilution outcomes from convertible securities, anti-dilution rights and ESOPs.
However, simply sharing details about such elements is disingenuous. To earn their trust through transparency, you must go a step further and create a pre-money and post-money cap table in the following manner:
1. Extend your existing cap table, and add a column to describe the equity type if this doesn’t already exist.
Note: Incoming investors can benefit by knowing the conversion triggers, forecasts and anti-dilution rights held by each existing investor.
2. Add columns for post-money units, stake values and ownership percentages.
Pro-tip: Improve the depth by adding columns for scenarios in which incoming investors buy stakes of existing shareholders. This also shifts the prospective investor's focus from whether to invest or not to how much to invest.
3. Add columns for post-conversion units, stake values and ownership percentages.
Pro-tip: Create an Excel formula that allows investors to input their desired post-money, post-conversion ownership percentage and automatically calculates the required investment amount.
While investors recognize that employee stock options are an effective tool for motivating, attracting and retaining talent, it is also a source of dilution for them. Over a single vesting cycle, the dilution from ESOPs can be as much as 10% to 15%. To further exacerbate the situation, predicting such dilution is challenging due to two key variables—option pool size and exercise rate—being inherently unpredictable.
Your option pool must adapt to your organization’s evolving needs, and it is challenging to predict how market conditions will align to influence how frequently employees exercise their options.
Hence, you must visualize several different ESOP-related dilution scenarios via a cap table in the following manner:
1. Estimate how many stock options will be vested and how many will be exercised over the current vesting cycle. Most ESOPs follow a one-year cliff and monthly vesting over three years, resulting in a four-year vesting cycle.
2. Duplicate your existing cap table and create a section for employee stock ownership if one doesn't already exist.
3. In the section for employee stock ownership, make subheaders for unvested stock options, exercised stock options and potential additions to employee ownership, which would denote vested and unexercised stock options.
4. Add columns for units held and ownership percentages for various years and scenarios.
Pro-tip: Use MS Excel's What-If Analysis tool to estimate dilution impact for different exercise rates.
Simple agreements for future equity (SAFE) are a popular instrument for securing funds without incurring financial obligations. However, if you plan to exit years down the line, you must consider the dilution impact of SAFE notes and other convertible securities.
Over time, these instruments can reduce your ownership stake significantly, in some cases, from 50% to as little as 10%. To manage this risk effectively, you should create a post-conversion cap table to assess and plan your equity position. Here's how you can do so:
1. Pinpoint trigger events and estimate timing.
Identify key trigger events like funding rounds, acquisitions or IPOs that make it beneficial to convert the convertible securities. Estimate when these events might happen based on your company's growth trajectory and market conditions. Review the maturity and expiry dates of these securities to fully understand conversion timing​.
Tax treatment of gains also has a great influence over conversion decisions. Many early-stage investors convert SAFE notes early to qualify for long-term tax treatment sooner.
2. Replicate your cap table and include conversion scenario columns.
Duplicate your existing cap table and add columns for units owned and ownership percentages for various conversion scenarios.
3. Leverage scenario modeling to assess dilution from partial conversions.
If partial conversion is possible, use cap table scenario modeling features to visualize different dilution outcomes.
While this was all about how you can leverage a cap table along with basic Excel formulas, advanced Excel tools, and inputs about hiring plans to gain valuable dilution insights, note that the key to properly preparing a cap table for dilution analysis lies in precision and consideration.
Do you want to understand the impact of ESOPs? Do you want to know how much to invest to get the desired post-money, post-conversion ownership percentage? What is the ultimate decision that the viewer wants to make based on dilution analysis?
Tackle such questions and include value additions like projections for different scenarios, data tables and formulas. By doing so, you can empower investors to make informed choices.

90,2025-02-05,"Business Insider Edition 
In 2008, my husband, Adam, and I decided to move to Oregon after cataclysmic flooding devastated eastern Iowa. Many suffered, but for us, it was more like a moment to rethink what we wanted from a place.

        I'm highly suggestible, so when all those articles about Portland, Oregon, started coming out in the late aughts about being the most sustainable, we started imagining ourselves there — me, with an absurd list of desirables (mushrooming culture, bookstores, coffee shops), and my husband, Adam, with his: resilience to the climate crisis.
    

        Adam's nickname is ""Long Game."" He had been comparing online simulations showing how the US climate shifted over time. These days, every listed home on Zillow gets graded for the climate crisis risk, but the maps looked different when we looked at them then. I remember parts of the country turning increasingly burgundy (hot, hurricane-y) when we adjusted by decade, while Oregon's Willamette Valley remained a light green throughout.
    

        We were sold.
    

        Initially, our shorthand was ""pioneer spirit,"" thinking it suggested that we were resilient dreamers. But eventually, as more and more Americans woke up to the perils of the weather, we called ourselves ""climate change movers.""
    

        Oregon isn't that great a place for people with climate anxiety, by the way. Just a few years later, the New Yorker published a story quoting the Pacific Northwest FEMA director as saying that with a coming earthquake expected to be 7.8 or higher on the Richter scale, everything west of I-5 ""will be toast.""
    

        That's a crippling idea to live with, but as a newcomer, it didn't take me long to see the entire state as one big man vs. wild story. The same cold, dramatic ocean coastlines, massive forests, and snow-capped peaks that call to the people here bring almost daily stories of them getting swept away by the waves or lured by a stunning vista to their doom off some pretty mountain path. Climate and geography are bedfellows.
    

        And those decade-and-a-half-old climate maps? They didn't indicate what we have now — extended droughts and wildfires so close you can smell them in your bedroom.
    

        We fell in love with the idea of it anyway.
    

        Moving is a great moment to redefine your next era, so in the wake of Obama's first election, as the housing crisis gathered steam and financial institutions collapsed, we moved to a 1910 farmhouse in Salem, where I decided I would become a sassy blogger who ragged on our new hometown. Soon, I had a newspaper column called ""Desperately Seeking Salem,"" where I spouted all the ways this place was failing me while calling out a few things I loved.
    

        This got me clout but only a trickle of friends. With no job and too much time on my hands, we decided to have a baby, and I was soon alone at home with my child and a keyboard.
    

        During the first years, Oregon confirmed many of my ideas: the stealth wealth of millionaires in vests, plaid, and beanies and the Tolkien-esque landscapes. I also discovered new markers of place to care about, like nice drivers, so much undiscovered, and midcentury modern architecture.
    

        But I sucked at being new in town. It was the worst I ever was as a human. I've never been lonelier. At home with a baby, with no jobs available in my field, and still seeing the place in terms of what it offered me, I fell deep into despair.
    

        My husband had a non-compete with his employer and was ready to start his own business, so I vowed to do it differently when we moved again three years later to McMinnville, a wine country town about an hour outside Portland.
    

        The things that call you to move to a place aren't necessarily what keeps you there. I had already visited McMinnville during its quirky UFO Parade and thought living in wine country sounded sexy. We bought a business in McMinnville, got a house loan, and had one day to buy a house.
    

        Over time, I learned what really keeps me planted, like the inspired state legislation known as the Urban Growth Boundary, a land use law requiring Oregon cities to reach a specific population density before expanding into neighboring farmlands and forests.
    

        Meanwhile, the climate crisis got worse.
    

        By September 2020, our first wildfire year, the air was so thick with smoke I brought our chickens inside, I had gotten much better at gauging risk. We had more information (though information isn't always a balm). We had Go Bags and a stock of water.
    

        By September 2021, another year of grape harvests ruined by smoke and people displaced from wildfires south and east of us, my urge to flee settled.
    

        Our climate predictions are always changing. When Zillow announced it would include climate risk information on listed homes, I was curious instead of paranoid.
    

        In the summer, our kids run in a pack of 10 and stage plays on the front porch. When our first son became a teenager, he roamed the entire town without a cell phone. We have never surveilled them because an entire community is doing so. My husband has a four-minute commute. I've worked from home for 15 years now. I don't even drink wine.
    

        I don't think we're special — climate moving is a tale as old as time. But I did learn that once I chose to invest in a place, I stopped seeing it in terms of its amenities. Once I insisted on creating roots, I looked for room to create what was missing. Once I knew how to make relationships outside easy things like school and workplaces, I knew I could do it anywhere.
    

        Once more people woke up to the climate crisis, we felt like we were in it together. That's where we are. The danger is always in the air, but it is not the air I am breathing — for now.

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's LG CNS shares fell from the initial public offering (IPO) price in their trading debut on Wednesday, as the country's largest stock listing in three years failed to arrest the recent trend of weak debuts.
Shares opened at 60,500 won and were last trading at 59,700 won, down from their issue price of 61,900 won.
Last month, the IT, cloud and AI services provider priced its IPO at the top of its targeted valuation range, raising 1.2 trillion won ($827.1 million).
In morning trade, the firm's market valuation was about 5.79 trillion won.
The IPO is the largest since LG Energy Solution raised $10.74 billion in 2022.
Last year, South Korea raised $2.85 billion worth of IPOs, according to LSEG data, up slightly from $2.79 billion in 2023.
The offering by LG CNS was one of the few by South Korean firms to draw strong demand in recent months against the backdrop of an IPO market slump since the second half of last year, analysts said.
The retail portion of the initial public offering was oversubscribed nearly 123 times, while more than 2,000 institutional investors made bids worth 76 trillion won during the bookbuilding last month, according to the company.
However, LG CNS's weak market debut has continued a trend of similarly disappointing listings since last year, which analysts say could further discourage investors and other companies from coming to market.
LG CNS will use 390 billion won of the 594 billion won it raised from the new issuance for mergers and acquisitions, while the rest will go towards paying off debt and investing in facilities, it said in a filing.
LG CNS CEO Hyun Shin-gyoon told reporters last month that it is looking for acquisitions in the AI space with a deal likely to be announced in ""the near future"".
About 54% of LG CNS' sales in the first three quarters of 2024 came from cloud and AI services, company data showed, which Samsung Securities analyst Oh Dong-hwan noted were responsible for faster growth and has higher margins than its other businesses such as IT systems integration and management.
LG CNS reported about 4 trillion won revenue and 313 billion won in operating profit during the first three quarters of 2024, according to its filing.

94,2025-02-05,"The Dusk creator’s new terror game isn’t much longer than a movie — thank goodness!
by  Chris Plante
Mario collects mushrooms. Donkey Kong collects bananas. The naked, blood-lusting loner of Butcher’s Creek collects snuff films.
More than likely, you already know whether you’re the sort of person who will play the latest gorefest from Dusk creator David Szymanski — or the sort of person who wonders how this shit is legal. I’ll share the grimy details for the few people still balancing on the entrails-covered fence.
Butcher’s Creek takes place in a pseudo-apocalyptic future in which nihilism and cruelty have won, any “heroes” have long died, and the people who remain eke out pleasure from others’ pain. The protagonist has a taste for recordings of killings, which is why they’re willing to make the poor decision to enter a terrifying, decrepit basement littered with soiled mattresses, busted light bulbs, and plaid-wearing Appalachian murder cultists. 
What follows is a knowingly nasty, thoughtfully crafted mashup of M-rated (or unrated) games like Manhunt, Kane & Lynch, and the never-officially-released Thrill Kill. This sticky subcategory inspired congressional hearings in the 1990s and fueled court cases in the 2010s. In its 2011 ruling in Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association, the U.S. Supreme Court afforded video games the same First Amendment protections as other art forms. And yet, with this new freedom, the expanded video game market found itself self-censoring for a different reason: to appeal to the broadest possible audience.
Butcher’s Creek’s grotesqueries could be mistaken for modern edgelord humor meant to enrage strangers on social media. But Szymanski has created something intentionally anachronistic as a piece of art, a throwback to when games existed as much to entertain as to provoke the ire of institutions, whether they be the government, retailers, or arts publications. 
Shortly after the game’s protagonist enters this moldy, musky underworld, a group of torturers captures the man, strips him naked, and prepares him to be the latest victim in the snuff films he had previously craved. Of course, the story can’t end there. The antihero (a word that feels like an understatement) breaks free and uses wrenches, planks of wood, and box cutters to seek revenge on his captors. To be clear, no lesson has been learned. The snuff films, on VHS tapes, serve as a currency for saving the game and unlocking new areas. Taking Polaroids of murder scenes restores health. The gap between the main character and the band of sickos is roughly as thick as a single sheet of Bible paper.
Is this fun? 
If you enjoyed the underrated Xbox 360 first-person melee game Condemned: Criminal Origins and have the constitution for the worst of human nature, yeah. Art can be many things, not all of them comfortable. What I admire about Szymanski’s games, which are short and appear with astonishing frequency, is that they are art. Nearly 15 years ago, video game developers gained protections that, for decades, had felt unattainable. Today, Szymanski isn’t simply taking advantage of those protections to create something shamelessly sadistic and hateful (of which there’s plenty to be found on Steam), but to engage with gaming history, the current cultural mood, and the assumptions we make about the very building blocks of design. Consider the mushroom, the banana, and the snuff tape. See how a power-up can be perverted. Contemplate what power for the sake of pleasure encourages.
And then bash a cultist with a hammer.

95,2025-02-05,"The Switch 2 currently faces three big questions following its January reveal: how powerful is it, what games will it have, and what will it cost? Nintendo was asked about that last one in its latest earnings call, and while the company’s president remained cagey, he also said Nintendo will continue to take its reputation for affordability into account when determining the final price, which some experts predict will be $400. 
The original Switch launched at $300 back in 2017. Since then, however, inflation has driven up the cost of various components, and console makers this generation have declined their usual hardware price cuts, even raising prices in some regions instead. And while it remains to be seen just how good the specs of the Switch 2 might be, this time around the device will also be partially competing with higher-end PC gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck. 
 “We are aware that inflation is currently rising and that the exchange rate environment has changed significantly since the launch of the Nintendo Switch in 2017,” Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa told investors in the company’s third-quarter earnings call this week, according to a translation by Nintendo Everything. “We also need to consider the affordable prices that customers expect from Nintendo products. When considering the price of our products, we believe that it is necessary to consider these factors from multiple angles. At this time, we cannot announce the specific price of the Nintendo Switch 2, but we are considering it taking into account various points.”
There will certainly be pressure to price the Switch 2 higher than its predecessor, especially because Nintendo traditionally tries to make profit off of its hardware rather than selling it under market value as a loss-leader for selling software. At the same time, Furukawa’s remarks suggest that, despite the wild popularity of the original Switch, Nintendo knows it risks pricing itself into irrelevance if it aims too high.
So what will the Switch 2 actually cost? Last month, IGN interviewed several industry analysts for their expert opinions. While some think Nintendo could charge as much as $500 for the new device, many are banking on it costing $400. This was the “sweet spot” for Rhys Elliot of MIDiA, and Ampere Analysis’ Piers Harding-Rolls told IGN he was currently basing his sales projections on the same number. At the same time, diehard fans upgrading in the first year would probably be willing to pay more. “Early adopters won’t be price sensitive, and prices can always be lowered,” Circana’s Mat Piscatella said. “Of course, people will want it to be lower than whatever it is it will be announced at.”
And what does history tell us Nintendo will do? Polygon assembled a chart of inflation-adjusted prices of all of the company’s consoles. Starting with the launch of the Nintendo 64, the price has mostly hung around $350 to $400. That seems like the minimum price this time around considering the Switch OLED itself is still $350, and while the Switch 2 is rumored to have a cheaper LCD screen, its other features, including the Joy-Con with mouse-like functionality, are a lot beefier this time around.

Polygon also notes that Nintendo has a history of trying to undercut its competition when it comes to price. This is the tradition of “affordability” Furukawa was referencing in this week’s call. But that will be harder to do late into a console generation where the disc-less PS5 is $450 (up from its 2020 launch price of $400). The current cheapest Steam Deck is also $400, though you can also get refurbished ones for under $300 when they’re available. 
My own gut tells me that making the Switch 2 cost $400 is the logical play here, with $450 the absolute max the company can charge, unless it debuts something truly stunning during its April Switch 2 Direct that will get people excited to upgrade. I showed my kids the original Switch 2 reveal and they haven’t asked about it again at all, content to keep toiling away in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Super Mario Bros. Wonder. 
Families without a parent that writes about video games for a living might feel similarly unmoved about upgrading early if the price is too high. But all of that will depend on everything Nintendo still hasn’t told us about it’s next console. We’ll have to wait a couple more months for that info too.

97,2025-02-05,"Disney’s (DIS) streaming business once again turned a profit last quarter. But its flagship platform is starting to lose subscribers.
The House of Mouse on Wednesday released its fiscal first-quarter results, with growth being driven primarily by the company’s box office dominance and profit gains in its streaming business.Disney stock rose about 1% during pre-market trading Wednesday.
 “Overall, this quarter proved to be a strong start to the fiscal year,and we remain confident in our strategy for continued growth,” Disney CEO Bob Iger said in a statement. He noted that the company had the top three movies last year: Inside Out 2, Deadpool & Wolverine, and Moana 2. 
But on the streaming side, paid subscriptions for Disney+ fell 1% from the previous quarter, to 124.6 million subscribers. The company also said it expects another “modest decline” in the second quarter.
Despite this, Disney reported that its overall streaming business, which includes Hulu and ESPN+, turned a profit, with operating income rising more 100% to $293 million in the three months ending Dec. 31. That compared with a loss of $138 million during same period in 2023.
Disney may have been late to the streaming game — Disney+ launched in 2019, more than a decade after Netflix (NFLX) — but it seems to have finally hit its stride, as long as it can stop or minimize shedding subscribers. After five years, the company’s streaming division finally urned a profit for the first time last year. And more recently, Disney expanded its portfolio by acquiring the sports-centric FuboTV. Disney has also raised its prices.
Overall, Disney’s profit rose 38% in in the three months ending Dec. 31 to $2.6 billion, from $1.9 billion in the same period the prior year. The company’s revenue was up 5% year-over-year to $24.7 billion in its fourth quarter, from $23.5 billion.. Its earnings per share came to $1.76, outperforming Wall Street expectations of $1.45, according to a consensus estimate from analysts surveyed by FactSet (FDS)
Amid all this, Disney continues to struggle with its traditional television assets, which include the broadcast network ABC and its cable channels National Geographic, FX, and others. The company reported that its operating income from the linear networks fell 11% to $1 billion million in its fourth fiscal quarter, from $1.2 billion in the same quarter in 2023.
Unlike some of its competitors, the company remains committed to its broadcast and cable networks — for now.

Mattel beat expectations for sales and earnings in the fourth quarter and saw its stock price jump by more than 15% today on the strength of its postive outlook for 2025. But executives acknowledged that recently announced tariffs could create headwinds for the company.
While Mattel is forecastingfull year net sales growth of 2% to 3% in 2025, and adjusted earnings per share growth of between 2% and 6%, higher U.S. prices related to tariffs could hurt consumer demand for toys.
Mattel Chairman and CEO Ynon Kreiz and Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro emphasized in a conference call Tuesday, after the earnings report was released, that the company has a number of strategies in place to mitigate the impact of tariffs.
Chief among those is Mattel’s ongoing efforts to move more of its manufacturing out of China.
“Over the past several years, we have been continuously optimizing and diversifying our manufacturing footprint,” DiSilvestro said. Mattel now sources products from seven different countries, he said, with China expected to represent less than 40% of global production for Mattel toys.
The U.S. represents about half of Mattel’s global toy sales, so “our tariff exposure in the U.S. related to China should be about 20% of global production,” DiSilvestro said.
Mattel currently sources less than 10% of its toys from Mexico, and none from Canada - two other countries that have been threatened with tariffs.
By 2027, no one country is expected to represent more than roughly 25% of total global production, or about half of that in terms of U.S. sales, DiSilvestro said.
Mattel’s Hot Wheels vehicles, and its Uno card game were the growth stars of the quarter, while Barbie sales and the doll category overall were down 4% compared to fourth quarter last year.
Sales of the popular Hot Wheels brand helped push the vehicles category up 14%, Mattel reported.
Mattel reported net sales of $1.646 billion, up 2%, and adjusted earnings per share of 35 cents, for the fourth quarter. Adjusted earnings per share came in 70% above analysts’ expectations of 20 cents.
Mattel’s winning quarter, and positive forecast for 2025 was the kind of good news the toy industry has been waiting for after a year when toy makers struggled to overcome bloated inventories and weakened demand.
“This a great way to kick off earning season as the toy industry needs optimism, especially due to the uncertainty of the economy,” said James Zahn, editor in chief at The Toy Book and Senior Editor at The Toy Insider.
At the international toy show in Germany last week, Speilwarenmesse in Nuremberg, Mattel impressed vistors with “a showroom packed with great toys and games for the year ahead,” Zahn said.
Mattel has a number of growth drivers as it begins its 80th year in business, Zahn said.
He expects Hot Wheels will have another record year in 2025, thanks primarily to the new Formula 1 products, and said that a strong movie year, with movies such as The Minecraft Movie, and Jurassic World Rebirth will also drive sales.
Mattel’s new line of building sets, Mattel Brick Shop, introduced at the Nuremberg show, looks like a potential winner, Zahn said. “The Brick Shop initiative is an elevated approach to what Mattel has already built with MEGA Construx and could give The LEGO Group a run for its money with certain consumers,” Zahn said.
While overall toy sales industrywide were down 0.6% globally, and down 0.3% in the United States in 2024, earlier forecasts had predicted a much greater decline. U.S. sales dropped 7% in 2023. Toy executives have been counting on 2025 as the year the industry would return to growth.
Mattel CEO Ynon Kreiz, on the conference call yesterday, said he continues to expect overall industry growth this year.
“We continue to see the industry performing better than people expect,” he said. “We continue to believe that the toy industry has strong fundamentals and that it will return to growth and will continue to grow over the long term.”
“We’re seeing toys continue to play an important part of consumers’ lives,” Kreiz said.
Zahn of The Toy Book also expects “a true return to growth for the U.S. toy industry overall” in 2025, “barring the potential for a full-blown trade war.”
“We’re looking at one of the strongest product lineups in recent years, and Mattel has a shared opportunity with its competitors to get some great play experiences in front of kids of all ages - from adults all the way up to adult collectors or ‘kidadults’,"" he said.

99,2025-02-05,"Despite holding on tight to its 10% gain for 2025, pressure sits sharply overhead at the $180 level for shares of semiconductor name Applied Materials (AMAT). Also keeping gains in check have been both the 20- and 200-day moving averages, the latter thwarting a breakout attempt and ending a six-day win streak on Jan. 22. This overhead resistance may be preceding a correction, however, as AMAT has landed on Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White’s list of the 25 best stocks to own in February.
Specifically, AMAT averaged an impressive February gain of 7.4% over the past 10 years, finishing higher eight times out of 10. From the security’s current perch of $179.89, a move of similar magnitude would place it above $193 for the first time since its late-January peak.
There is ample room for upgrades as well. Heading into today, 11 covering brokerage firms sport a tepid ""hold"" or worse recommendation, and should this bearish sentiment begin to unwind, it could act as a tailwind for the semiconductor stock.
Daily chart of AMAT since August 2024 with 20- and 200-day moving averages
Due out after the close on Thursday, February 13 is Applied Materials’ quarterly report, where analysts anticipate an earnings per share of $2.28. AMAT’s historical post-earnings performance leave much to be desired, with the stock finishing flat or lower in six of its past eight reports, averaging a swing of 3.5%. This time around, options traders are anticipating an 8.6% move, regardless of direction.
